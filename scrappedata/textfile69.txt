[{"Movie":"Boat That Rocked","Title":"Fresh Start","Author":"WonderfulWonderful","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12932563","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Jenny had grown used to the comfort of the small office in the dingiest corner of London. It had small side light that was now the main light ever since the bulb in the overhead light had blown. Rory didn't see the point in replacing it: \"It's more money, isn't it? \". The wallpaper was apparently once green and you could just make it hints of the old floral pattern. There was a side table with stacks of paper and two wooden desks with typewriters on each one. The sign on one of the tables read: 'Imogen Warley'. Her official name, not that she used it when writing. Jenny Warley just had a much nicer ring to it. Though the girls at school thought Jenny Whore-ly sounded even catchier. At least she didn't have to think about them anymore. The door to the office had a glass window with peeling letters that once read out 'Quaver and Crotchet'. It was a niche music magazine. Hardly in line with the likes of Rolling Stone or NME. They had a small but devoted audience. Jenny just wished the name was catchier. It sounded more like the name of a child's introduction to piano book than a magazine that covered modern music. It was named as such after the founder Rory Crotchet, though Jenny doubted that was his actual last name or that he ever founded it with an 'Edmund Quaver'. Ed, as Rory always referred to him as, had never written any articles as Jenny noticed when trying to archive in her first week on the job. There were no pictures, no visits – he was a ghost. Jenny had been very proud when she first got the job. It was her very own and far different from what was available. She knew her mum would have preferred her taking on the secretary position offered to her by her Uncle but Jenny didn't care. Her parents warmed to it eventually. Slowly they began buying the monthly copy and reading her articles. They helped her secure her own flat too. Rory entered the office and slammed the door behind him. \"We need a new story and it needs to be good.\" He slammed down a pile of papers on his desk. \"Okay, well, er, there's a new youth choir—\" \"No chance.\" \"Um, we could focus on street talent—\" \"Think bigger!\" \"Interview up and coming bands—\" \"We're better than that!\" \"Well not meaning to be rude Rory but there's not a lot else we can do.\" Jenny sighed. \"What do you mean we can't?\" Rory pulled out a cigarette and wedged it between his lips. He fumbled around for a lighter, \"Listen here sweetheart, we need to score big on the next issue or you can kiss this business goodbye.\" \"What?\" Jenny reached for a lighter in her draw and lit his cigarette. \"Thanks. What I mean is I've just been talking to the big guys at the bank and we're on the verge on bankruptcy. One more dud issue and we're smoke. You have 3 days to get back to me with something. Anyway I have some errands to run. Oh and remember if this business goes down, it's going down because of you.\" Rory slammed the door behind him and Jenny gaped after him. She reached for the new papers on his desk and scanned through the accounts. It was true. There was just enough money to make a small publication. After that there was nothing. And there was no chance of a loan either. They'd already had too many. Jenny sat in her chair, chewing at her nails and fighting back tears. This was her independence crumbling before her. She pulled her chair further into the desk and began fervently typing out a to-do list. Places to go, people to talk to – anywhere she could find that hidden gem. She tore away the paper and grabbed her coat. She hurried out the door with her handbag in one hand and her notepad in the other. She only just remembered to lock the door on the way out. Jenny ran all over London visiting jazz bars and clubs, street corners and talent scouts. It didn't matter at this point if it was rock and roll. Maybe that's what the magazine needed; a fresh look. Everywhere said no. Either there was no one to offer, or they had scrunched their noses at the sound of Quaver and Crotchet. She deeply regretted wearing heels to work and by the time it was dark she finally gave in and took the shoes off her feet and walked down the streets of London in her stockings, attracting disapproving looks from passer-by's. Soon enough when she was done with people staring; Jenny took refuge in a pub, sinking into a corner booth with a pint to sooth her tiredness. She probably looked an absolute state; footless with dishevelled hair and clasping onto a pint with all dear life. She knew she just ought to drown her sorrows now. This was it for her. No more job, no more nice flat. It was time to head home to Mum and Dad. After finishing her first pint, Jenny made her way to the bar for another, this time donning her shoes to at least appear normal as one of the few females in the place. As she waited to be served she heard a growl. Someone jabbed a finger into her shoulder and she turned around to see a podgy man with glasses and thick sideburns. There was something familiar about him that distracted Jenny from hearing his flirtatious remarks. Something about the eyes and the grin. Her eyes widened. It was David Timmins! From secondary school. He'd certainly gained more weight…or was he always like that? Jenny couldn't actually remember. \"Did you go to St Benedict's Secondary?\" She interrupted his spiel of romance. He blinked at her for a few moments, \"Jenny Whor- I mean Warley?\" Jenny grinned, ignoring the small slip-up, \"In the flesh.\" \"My God how long has it been?\" He exclaimed, eyeing her up, \"I must say you look great.\" \"Thank you; you don't look too bad yourself, David.\" \"Please, call me Dave. And you don't have to be polite about this old thing,\" He smacked his hands against his belly, \"Some ladies love it, others don't.\" \"So what are you up to now?\" Jenny asked. \"Oh me? I'm actually a radio DJ.\" He replied \"Oh really? Where?\" \"Well my pretty Jenny, have you ever heard of…\" Dave cleared his throat, \"Radio Rock?\" Jenny's eyes widened and she smacked her hands down on the counter, \"You don't?\" \"Oh but I do.\" He grinned. He turned to the barman, \"Two pints please.\" \"That's incredible. You're Doctor Dave? This entire time I've been listening to an old school mate and I didn't even realise!\" \"You're okay with a pint by the way?\" Jenny nodded. \"Perfect.\" Dave replied as he paid for the drinks. He carried them away and beckoned for Jenny to follow him. He led her to a table. Three other guys were nursing drinks. They immediately perked up at the sight of Jenny. \"Well, well, well, what lovely lady do we have here?\" A ginger haired man asked in a distinctively New Zealand voice. Jenny knew for certain that he was Angus. \"This, my friend, is Jenny. We went to school together.\" Dave gestured for her to sit down first and he squeezed in next her. Jenny nodded a hello at her other neighbour. He had brown curly hair and when he spoke he spoke with an Irish accent. That was Simon. She often listened to him when she arrived early to the office to finalise the magazine for publication. \"And these, Jenny, are Angus, The Count and Simon.\" Dave took a swig of his drink as the others waved. That meant that the blond guy with a gingery beard and a leather waistcoat had to be the Count. He stroked his beard and watched Jenny. \"So Jenny,\" The Count began, \"What brings a girl like you to a place like this?\" \"Well that's quite a story.\" She giggled, \"To put it simply I had some very tiring work errands. I needed a chance to rest my feet so I stopped at the first pub I could.\" \"What exactly do you do?\" \"I'm a writer for a music magazine.\" The table nodded in approval. \"Actually you guys could help me.\" Jenny said, \"My magazine could cease to exist after the next issue if I don't get a good feature article and thousands of people listen to Radio Rock. I understand if you don't want to but you would literally be saving my life.\" There was a pause and then Dave perked up, \"I'll see what I can do. If you give me your number then I can call you back by tomorrow and we can go from there?\" Jenny smiled. She grabbed her notepad and scrawled out the office number. She handed it to Dave who shared a knowing look with the others. Jenny took a long drink and sighed. Finally she was making progress. She sat with the men for another couple of hours. Another member joined them later on. He was the infamous Midnight Mark. He'd just returned from wooing a lady at a bar across the street. Jenny thought he might speak up more in the group than he did on the radio but he turned out to be the same no matter the circumstances. She got the call the next day at 9am, though Jenny had been waiting around since 6 with Radio Rock playing in the background, worried they might call and she'd miss it. She grinned from ear to ear as Dave confirmed that Quentin, the owner of the station, had approved the interview. She would join them at 6pm that evening on the actual Radio Rock boat. She couldn't contain her excitement anymore as she put the phone down. She hooted and cheered with joy before finally taking a seat and working out how she would get to and pay for transport out to Suffolk. The dock came into sight as the taxi pulled up. After hours of preparing notes, taking a train and then a taxi, Jenny was drained. She thanked the driver and paid the fare before making her way up to the small boat. A sailor waited by the controls as the boat bobbed up and down. \"Are you Jenny Warley?\" The sailor asked. She nodded \"Well step in and we can get going.\" Jenny tentatively lowered herself into the boat and gripped onto the side for support as the boat pulled away from the land and out to the ocean. Jenny clutched her case of files tightly. She'd packed a tape recorder and she prayed it actually worked. Soon the boat's silhouette came into sight and then Jenny could make out the big white letters saying: 'Radio Rock'. She also noticed two figures staring out towards her. The boat came to a halt at the rock ships side, right next to a ladder. \"Thank you\" Jenny said to the sailor. She grabbed her case and a bag containing the recorder and began her climb up the ladder. Hands reached out to take her belongings. She made it to the top and thanked the men too. It was Dave and Simon. They led her off the deck and into a studio space. There was a long dining table and a bed and a desk. At the desk sat an ageing man. Surely not all the DJs had this? \"This is where we leave you but we will see you shortly.\" Dave explained. She waved goodbye to the pair of them and turned towards the man who had now gotten up from his seat. \"You must be the Jenny that I've heard so much about.\" He began, reaching out his hand. He had a firm grip. \"And you are Quentin?\" Jenny hazarded a guess. \"You are correct. Now obviously you are here for just a couple hours-if that-for your lovely interview and I'm more than happy to help you out in your predicament, but I just wanted to give you a chance to at least warn you of some small things.\" \"Right?\" Jenny eyed the man up warily. \"As you may or may not know this is a predominantly male inhabited boat. We do have one female which few know about. She is our lovely cook Felicity. My point is that if any of the men, especially Mark, offer you a moment alone, don't take it. They are all dashing men and you are a very beautiful woman and I'd certainly be a hypocrite to discourage it but basically…don't sleep with them. Sure if you meet them again in London and they invite you here by all means.\" \"I see.\" \"Good. Now that's out of the way I can take you to meet the DJs. Unfortunately Angus is on air at the moment so he won't be there for the interview, but between you and mean that's not really a pity now is it?\" Quentin snorted and then guided Jenny out of his quarters, back onto the deck and across to common room where the DJs were gathered around a booth. She smiled at them. \"Hi, if you don't already know who I am, I'm Jenny Warley from Quaver and Crotchet magazine.\" There was a snicker here and there. Jenny sighed. \"Kevin?\" Quentin called. \"Yes?\" A man looked up with wide eyes and floppy hair. \"Could you sit this one out?\" Quentin asked. He sighed, \"Okay.\" Kevin got up and left the room in a sulk. Jenny set up the recorder and arranged the files with all her notes accordingly. \"Everyone ready?\" She asked They cheered. She pressed play. Jenny watched Rory skim through her article with dread in her heart. Every furrow of the eyebrow, or scratch of his head sent her reeling. He didn't like it. Of course he didn't. But wait he seemed excited? Did he? It was pure agony waiting for him to finish. When he finally stopped murmuring along with the article, Jenny thought her heart was going to burst. \"Well?\" She asked \"How the fuck did you secure something like this?\" \"An old friend.\" \"It's brilliant. It really is. No other magazine has this. I'm proud of you Jen.\" \"Really?\" \"Really. Now wrap up a couple more filler articles – something about those youth choirs you mentioned – and get this to the printers by Friday. Got it?\" \"I'm on it!\" Jenny nodded. A permanent grin had set on her face and didn't budge, not even when her sister came over to moan about her husband or when it rained down and she didn't have an umbrella or hood. Nothing could break it. She was grinning at the printers and grinning when it went on sale. She grinned when he parents called her to congratulate her though her Mum showed concern in putting a spotlight on Radio Rock. She grinned as it flew off the shelves and 100 more copies had to be printed and she grinned all the way up until Rory said: \"I'm shutting down the company.\" \"What?\" Jenny stammered. \"You heard me.\" \"But, but I got you that article. It's the best sales you've had since you started the damn thing!\" \"I know and I really do appreciate it and it's not because we're bankrupt. NME called. They want to bring me into their team. Clearly they've learned what real talent looks like!\" \"But I wrote that article. I found it for you.\" \"Yeah and it means a lot but I've been climbing this ladder for a decade so I deserve my shot. You just have to wait your turn like everyone else. Make sure to take all your things by tonight. I told the landlord we'd be out of here by tomorrow. Thanks again, sweetheart.\" Rory donned his hat and coat, picked up his typewriter and the photo of his wife and kids and walked out just like that. Jenny was furious. She stared at the wide open door wide eyed and ready to scream. She should have just let it sink. At 9pm that night, Jenny left the humble comfort of an office she knew she would miss with her possessions boxed up into a cardboard box. She locked the door one final time and left the key at reception. She wasn't sure where to go after that. She couldn't face her parents nor could she stand the thought of standing in a flat she knew she was about to lose and so in the end she decided on the same pub where she reunited with her old school friend. As she walked through the doors she spotted Dave and Simon laughing and drinking at the same table as before. Dave looked up for a moment and noticed Jenny. He invited her over and gestured to a spare seat next to Simon. \"Well if it isn't our favourite writer! Well done on the article.\" Dave cheered. He raised his glass, \"To Jenny Warley.\" Simon raised his with a wide grin, \"To Jenny Warley.\" \"I just lost my job.\" She confessed. The men lowered their glasses and frowned. \"I'm sorry to hear that Jen.\" Dave sighed \"But I swear you just wrote the best article that company has ever seen?\" Simon piped up. \"It was so good that NME offered my boss a job and so he's shut down the magazine.\" She explained \"Wait, your boss?\" Dave asked. \"My boss, yep.\" She groaned \"But you wrote it—\" \"I know.\" \"What a dick.\" Simon said. \"Tell me about it.\" She sighed. \"Would you like a drink?\" Dave asked \"Please.\" She replied. Dave got up and made his way to the bar, leaving them to make idle conversation. \"I'm sorry. You know about the whole losing your job thing.\" Simon took a sip of his drink. \"It's okay.\" Jenny said as she rested her head on the table. \"I've never realised how difficult it is to make conversation when someone tells you they've lost their job.\" Simon chuckled nervously. \"Don't worry about it. I'll be more of a laugh when I have alcohol down me.\" She yawned \"I know you'll be back on your feet soon though.\" \"How so?\" \"You seem resilient. Got the hard stuff.\" Jenny sat up and smiled, \"I sure hope so. The show's sounding good.\" \"Really? You think so? I worry sometimes. The jokes aren't too much are they?\" \"The jokes are perfect.\" \"You're going to love me.\" Dave slammed two pints down on the table, dragging the pair out of their small talk. \"Oh?\" Jenny raised an eyebrow as she quickly began gulping down the brown liquid. \"Steady on Jen. So while the barman sorted my drinks I made a quick call to our lovely Quentin and he says he can offer you a bed.\" Dave took his seat and sat back proudly. \"But how's that possible? Radio Rock doesn't take girls, you said so yourself in the interview. Obviously there's Felicity but she's—\" Jenny quickly glanced around the bar, \"of a certain persuasion.\" \"I mean he wasn't jumping for joy at the idea but he's met you and he likes you and he feels bad. He said he'll sort some kind of work for you when you get there. I mean you could even come back with us tonight if you want.\" Dave grinned, taking a swig of his pint. Jenny pressed her lips together, \"I'll have to speak to my landlord first and gather up my things. Give me a week to even things out and then I'll join you if Quentin hasn't changed his mind by then. Could I possibly have the boat's number so I can make arrangements with Quentin myself?\" \"Of course!\" Dave felt about for his address book in his jacket. He pulled out the small leather book and pressed it down on the table at the right page. Jenny grabbed a piece of paper from her box and scrawled out the details. \"Thank you.\" She smiled before taking another long sip of her drink. And within a week Jenny ended her tenancy and received the whole wrath of her mother. Apparently after rock and roll magazines, a rock and roll ship was a step too far. \" But you don't even know what they'll be doing!\" She had cried, \"They could get you pregnant! Those men have no morals.\" But Jenny pushed it behind her and, as she had arranged with Quentin, she arrived at the docks in Suffolk for precisely 11am and departed with the same sailor from her previous visit towards a life a far cry from a humble London office.

Six forty-three. Mark grunted angrily. He had gotten to sleep only three hours ago. Oh well. No getting back to sleep now. Mark stumbled out of bed and picked up the shirt he had worn yesterday. He slipped it over his shoulders without looking at it and pulled aside the curtain in his room, only to see darkness, with just a hint of pink light playing along the edges of the crashing waves. Mark was intrigued. In all his years of living on Radio Rock, he had never actually seen a sunrise. Mark pulled on a pair of boots kept by the door and a knit wool hat that one girl had left some months ago before slipping out of his room, through the halls of the ship, and outside into the chilly spring air. Gusts of wind rocked Radio Rock to and fro, and pushed clouds advancing on the horizon away. Mark approached the raining along the edge of the boat just as the glowing orb of the sun rose above the storming waters. The skies colored themselves a dark, dark pink, and wisps of purple clouds darted around. Mark vaguely remembered an old sailors' rhyme: \"Red skies at morning, sailor take warning. Red skies at night, sailors' delight.\" Mark had never seen a sky burn red at all, until now. Hopefully there won't be much radio interference, he though. Evidently, nature had never heard that old sailors' rhyme, because as the sun rose further, the winds died down, leaving great swathes of dark purple clouds among the fading pink. The mirror image of the still-ascending sun shined in the water, casting tiny sun-shaped reflections everywhere as the water rose and fell.. Mark felt a sudden warmth around his shoulders. He reached up to his shoulders and felt a woolen blanket, then looked around and saw Carl, standing by his side, wrapped in another blanket. \"You looked cold,\" Carl explained. Mark nodded and pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders. The two stood in silence as the sun finally rose completely out of the English Channel into its rightful place in the sky. Eventually, the muted buzz of activity and conversation in the cabins grew louder and the smell of Felicity's eggs rushed toward them. Carl looked up at Mark. \"We should go in, I guess.\" Mark nodded. The two turned away from the skies and started into their proxy home. The prospect of loud conversation and dirty jokes seemed unwelcome after the peace of a sunrise. \"Mark?\" \"Hm?\" \"Why is your shirt inside out?\" ","Summary":" Mark rolled over and looked at his clock though one bleary eye.

Inspired by: A deleted scene from \"The Boat That Rocked\". Easily available on YouTube: watch?v=t5HoKGdRfwI (Start video at 0:54.) Twatt really hadn't known what to expect when he was invited around for dinner at his Sir Alistair's house. The dinner itself had been stifling and formal. He'd only got through it because of the daughter. God, she was pretty. Extremely pretty. It was a shame though. Sir Alistair would never allow it. Probably because of the family name. Twatt sighed and took another puff on his cigarette before dropping it onto the pavement and entering his own dingy, little flat. The next day, it was around six o'clock in the evening when the phone rang. At the time, he'd been halfway through drawing up the Marine Offences Act, an act which would slaughter those damn pirates once and for all. Expecting the caller to be Miss C, Twatt answered it with a heavy-hearted hello. The person who answered back however, was not Miss C. \"Hello. I just wanted to ring... say hello. And apologise, for my dad.\" It was her. Sir Alistair's daughter. He could barely speak with the shock. \"Jemima. Hello. I'm so sorry; I thought you were a colleague...\" \"Don't worry. I haven't got much time though. I just wanted you to know that I had a great time last night. Dad's dinners can be so boring sometimes. It was nice to see a new face.\" Her voice was gentle and soft, like a whisper. It was so different to the sharp, clipped tone of her father's and the reedy, delicate tone of her mother's. Twatt smiled, listening to her speak. \"It's fine. I had a nice time too.\" There was a long pause. Twatt momentarily wondered if he'd said the wrong thing. Finally, she spoke. \"My dad can be a bit of dick at times can't he?\" \"It's not my place...\" \"I won't tell anyone.\" \"Oh.\" Twatt paused, wondering what to say next. \"Well, admittedly, he can be a bit forceful.\" \"I've lost count of the amount of potential boyfriends he's driven away from me.\" \"Are they never good enough?\" \"Not to his standards. I think he wants me to marry a mini-me of him,\" she muttered with a heavy sigh. A bubble of laughter emitted from Twatt's throat. \"That does sound awful,\" he murmured. \"Yes. Goodnight Dominic.\" \"Goodnight... Jemima.\" The phone beeped suddenly, indicating that she'd run off. Quietly, Twatt put the phone back onto its receiver. He picked up his pen to do some work, but stopped himself. A small smile grew on his lips as the conversation ran through his mind and his brain processed the words. Her voice was so sweet and gentle, yet it had an authoritative air. He was tempted to ring her back, but he didn't. Too risky that someone else would pick up, and anyway, Sir Alistair would fire him on the spot. For the rest of the night, Twatt diligently carried on with his work with the wonderful sound of her voice as his soundtrack. People: Miss C, Fredericks and Mark. (O.C: Miss C's boyfriend) Rating: M. Inspired by: The question of exactly what could have happened to make Miss C be such a devoted but secret listener to Radio Rock. It was a late night in the office when Miss C discovered her liberation. She'd been rushed off her feet all day and now she was tired. However, she still had a stack of letters to write, all of them detailing Sir Alistair's disgust at many different things. He was such a cross, tight little man. As soon as she had the money she needed, she was gone. She'd only entered this job because of the salary. What she really wanted to do was open up a bookstore, somewhere in London high street. Her boyfriend already worked as an artist, and she'd promised that when she had her bookstore open, she would sell some of his items for him in the store. In return, he'd promised to marry her. It was a compromise that they both liked, but first she had to find some money, and that was what had landed her here, in a grey suit and in a grey office, typing on a grey typewriter. So little colour in this world. The only way she got through it was by imagining one of her boyfriend's many paintings, all of which were always bright with colour and vivid with life. She sighed and continued typing, the low sounds of the radio near to her right buzzing in her ear. It was tuned to Radio 4 and deadly dull. However, as the night wore on, her exhaustion slowly began to overcome her. When she found herself slumped against the typewriter and snoring lightly, that's when she knew she needed coffee. Pausing in her work, she got up and went to the break room. Hardly anyone was there, aside from one blue-suited man who was lying on the mint green sofa, snoring loudly. She recognised him as Fredericks, the one that Sir Alistair referred to as \"the one with the bad haircut\". A pile of papers were scattered on the coffee table in front of him, notes of black ink scrawled carelessly over them. Deciding not to disturb him, Miss C quietly began to make herself a coffee. Suddenly, behind her, she heard a groan. She turned her head. Fredericks had woken up, and he looked like hell. \"What time is it?\" he muttered groggily. \"20 past ten,\" Miss C said, a little more sharply than she'd intended. \"Oh. I must've been asleep longer than I thought.\" Fredericks sighed heavily and buried his face in his hands. Miss C stared at him, feeling nothing but sympathy for the poor man. Sir Alistair would never be content until everyone in this office was exactly like him, all of them black-suited with slicked back hair and wide framed glasses. He wanted an army of subordinates, just so the 'common people' weren't able to listen to the music he happened to dislike. \"Do you want a coffee?\" Fredericks looked up, and blinked. No-one in this office had ever offered him anything before. \"Er, yes. Please.\" \"Milk? Sugar?\" \"Milk, two sugars.\" There were a few minutes silence as Miss C made the coffee. She always took hers black, especially when she was tired. When the coffee was made, she picked up the two polystyrene cups and moved towards Fredericks, handing him his coffee. He gestured for her to sit down, but she shook her head. \"No thanks. Sorry, but I have to get back to work.\" \"Oh. Of course. Same here. See you around, Miss...\" \"Just call me Miss C. Everyone does around here.\" Fredericks nodded, taking a sip of coffee. Miss C smiled warmly at him and left. It was nice to know that there was someone apart from her in this office that hated late nights. Back at her desk, she sat down and leant back in her chair, quietly and slowly sipping her coffee. Sir Alistair's indignant opinions would have to wait. The radio was still going, still droning on about something or other. Something to do with the economy. Carelessly, she reached out and began to tune it, looking for something else to listen to. She didn't even care if she landed on the fishing forecast. Anything that wasn't dreary old politics. Suddenly, the radio hit a signal and music bled out of the speaker, breaking the dreary peace of the office. Miss C sat up a little, recognising it. \" If you want someone to play with... \" the song sang, Aaron Neville's voice breaking through the speaker as if singing straight to her. She smiled, mouthing along with the words as the song played. As she sipped her coffee, she found herself swaying slowly with the beat. She could just visualize her boyfriend now. His brown shaggy hair, his strong torso under her hands, his breath sweet on her cheek as he whispered sweet nothings in her ear. As the song built into its crescendo, the images in her mind evolved into a memory, specifically the last time she and he had made love. It had been wonderful. It was on her birthday and he'd been hiding himself for months, working on a special project. The project had turned out to be her present: a portrait of her, with her long blonde hair flowing down her naked back. He'd captured her perfectly. They'd made love right there and then, in the midst of his studio. It made her heart melt and her body warm just to think about it. The song faded to a stop and a voice replaced the song. \"Wow,\" was all it said. Miss C smiled and sipped her last sip of coffee, the memory still fresh in her mind. So this was Radio Rock, the scourge of the high seas. And it was perfection. ","Summary":" People: Dominic Twatt/Jemima Dormandy (Minister Dormandy's daughter) Rating: K.

I have a habit of taking long breaks in between writing; maybe this will help fix that. We'll see how it goes. \"There was a great BANG and the boat lurched forward; Radio Rock was setting sail at last.\" It was another early morning on the Radio Rock boat, and Thick Kevin couldn't sleep. It wasn't because he was affected by The Count's comment last night (\"Maybe you should drink more often, if it really does sharpen your mind,\" he had said), or that he had once again stayed in \"The Room of No Sex\" with Simon, Felicity and John last Saturday, or even when someone (Quentin? Harold?) had told him (no, it was Dave) that he smelled of rotten eggs (yes, it must have been Dave). No, Kevin couldn't sleep because the boat was a mess - What else is new , he thought - and something in him said that he had to clean it all up. That was what he did, it was part of his job: cleaning the boat when necessary, and providing unintentional comic relief for the rest of the boat. He quite enjoyed both activities. Trying to be as careful as possible, Kevin crept out of the top bunk of the bed that he shared with Carl and slipped out into the quiet corridor. Somehow, he had been successful at keeping quiet - perhaps the rest of his day would be good as well. He passed Simon on his way to the supply closet; they each muttered a quick \"good morning\" before moving along to begin their day. Simon's morning show started in ten minutes, broadcasting to millions of listeners across the United Kingdom. The thought of having that job terrified Kevin - thankfully, Quentin would never, ever consider making Kevin a DJ. Kevin had a pattern when it came to cleaning: on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, he would start with the bathroom near his room; Tuesdays and Thursdays meant he cleaned the kitchen first, and on Saturdays and Sundays he would start with cleaning his room. Today was a Thursday, so that meant Kevin was on his way to the kitchen to scrub every inch of it that he could reach. Cleaning the kitchen, the bathrooms, the general living area, the corridors, the recording areas, and the room he shared with Carl - that was Thursday's cleaning pattern. Thursday also meant that Kevin had to collect the laundry from the boat's other inhabitants. He went to Simon's room first; it was the closest, and Simon was broadcasting anyways. He was known to talk in his sleep, which made Kevin glad that he did not get up to clean any earlier than 5:55 a.m. precisely. He went to Harold's room next, because Harold had to get up early to assist the DJs. John was awake as well; nothing excited him more than early morning news and weather, which Kevin found a bit odd. As Kevin collected the laundry from Dave's room, he noticed a knitting magazine threatening to slip behind the dresser. Kevin looked between the daytime DJ and the magazine for a moment before slowly helping the magazine along on its journey to the floor - he would come back for it later. Angus was already awake, listening to Simon's show; he had piled his dirty laundry neatly by the door. The still sleeping Count didn't show any signs of waking up, which made it easier for Kevin to collect the clothing strewn around the floor and place it into the giant laundry bin. Gavin's clothes were in a small basket by the foot of his bed; Kevin dumped the contents of the basket into the laundry bin and was out in seconds. With a majority of the DJs out of the way, Kevin stopped for a moment to think. Felicity and Quentin insisted on doing their own laundry, and the crew's laundry was done separately. That meant that Kevin had two more rooms to stop by: Bob's and Mark's. Kevin automatically headed for Bob's room first; Kevin felt much safer if he stayed as far away from Mark's room as possible. It wasn't because Mark was frightening - Kevin just had an irrational fear of going into his room. Bob was half awake when Kevin entered; the older man gave a half smile before drifting off to sleep again. Kevin waited for a few moments before grabbing Bob's dirty laundry and sneaking out to slip the clothes into the bin. After taking a few deep breaths and taking a mental note to get a grip on himself, Kevin made his way to Mark's room. As always, the room was dark, big and practically empty - unfortunately, this meant that every sound that Kevin made was magnified by ten. Kevin took off his trainers in the hopes that it would make his footsteps quieter, and made sure to skip the third step from the bottom (it squeaked), and, somehow, successfully reached Mark's laundry basket without waking the late night DJ (Kevin thought of him as the early early early DJ, seeing as midnight was actually morning, which meant that it wasn't actually night anymore). Getting out, however, was not as easy as it was to get in. Kevin made it to the door without making a sound; in fact, he made it into the hallway and dropped the clothes he had collected into the large (and almost full) laundry bin. Unfortunately, Kevin was easily distracted, and the mysterious Midnight Mark was always a topic of interest for him. Kevin turned around and leaned in the doorway, watching Mark sleep - Kevin couldn't actually see him; Mark was covered in layers of blankets, a habit he had taken to when Kevin brought up the fact that he noticed Mark slept in the nude (Kevin had actually written to his mother once about it, and, for some unexplainable reason, she seemed quite interested). When he realised that he had been staring at Mark for an uncomfortably long amount of time, Kevin slowly turned around to leave - and proceeded to trip quite loudly over thin air. The next thing Kevin remembered was attempting to dodge the multiple objects that were being thrown at him, and eventually getting hit in the back of the head with a slipper; Kevin hurriedly closed the door behind him, and just in time, too - there was a loud crash on the other side, and Kevin was quite sure that Mark had just thrown something no lighter than the giant clock resting on his wall. During the course of the midnight show with Mark, Gavin and The Count exchanged a few choice words during a particularly intense game of poker; Simon was going on about a beautiful sunset he had witnessed to anyone who would listen (Carl and Angus were, unfortunately, in Simon's immediate area); Dave was \"teaching\" John about how to give women what they like; and Harold was sitting silently next to Thick Kevin (who had already forgotten about that morning's events). And that was the last time that true peace would reside on the Radio Rock boat. \"I have news for everyone,\" Quentin announced, leaning on the rail of the stairwell. \"And it's not very pretty at all.\" Everyone turned their attention to the radio station's owner with identical expressions of curiosity. \"Don't tell me we're getting shut down,\" The Count said, narrowing his eyes. \"I refuse to stop broadcasting because of goddamn political we-\" \"We're not getting shut down,\" Quentin interrupted. \"Not yet.\" He scanned the faces of the men in front of him. \"We have to move.\" Shock replaced curiosity, and an uproar followed seconds later. \"WHAT?\" \"Why?\" \"This is not a good idea at all-\" \"This is ridiculous, come on, Quentin-\" \"Where are we going to go?\" Quentin stood silently, waiting for the room to calm down; eventually, it did, so he began to explain. \"I've received word that Her Majesty's Government aims to shut us down by making a new law that will forbid any pirate radio station from broadcasting, due to the danger we cause by blocking other, more important radio transmissions, such as distress calls.\" Quentin straightened his jacket, allowing his words to sink in. \"However,\" he continued, \"there is a way to get around such a law.\" \"Become a real radio station?\" Kevin asked. \"Well, that, too,\" Quentin replied, giving a half-shrug. \"But where's the fun in that? So, as of tomorrow morning, we'll be on our way to a small island that is owned by a dear friend of mine. He's sent someone out to check our engines, and - if we're in proper working condition by then - we'll be setting sail on schedule.\" \"And we'll still be able to broadcast, yeah?\" asked Dave, raising a hand to direct Quentin's attention. \"Of course we will,\" Quentin said, obviously offended. He straightened himself even more than usual and sniffed. \"You don't think I thought out every detail?\" Dave opened his mouth to reply, but thought better of it and shrugged in agreement. Everyone fell silent; the only noises that could be heard was the music coming through the speakers and the waves hitting the very bottom of the boat. And then- \"So when are we leaving?\" Kevin asked, sitting up. ","Summary":" Mestresse Island No Beta Rated T in case of future chapters - may change later.

Title: A Damn Good Shag Character(s): Everybody's in Rating: T just in case Dave looked up, a knowing, mischievous grin on his face as his eyes traveled over the faces of his peers. They'd been talking about previous Sensational Saturdays over their burnt meal when the question of the century crept into his mind. \"If you, my dear gentlemen, had to forsake the sensational part of your Saturdays, and could not-I repeat not get someone from shore, who would you sleep with?\" Angus gave a wary, disappointed survey of the room before turning back to Dave. \"From the group of us?\" he asked uncertainly, hopeful that Dave meant some secret stash of girls on another ship. Dave nodded slowly, his eyes closed, waiting for the chaos to ensue. There was a long pause as the men looked over each other with an unwillingly skeptic gaze. None of them wanted to say a name or acknowledge that they'd pursue anyone on the ship romantically, yet they couldn't help but silently choose who out of the other DJ's would be the best for them. \"Oh come on,\" coaxed Dave impatiently. \"It can't be that bad.\" Angus gave a much noticed once over of Mark before looking down at the table in humiliation, changing his mind. Dave sighed. \"Fine, you bunch of babies. Everyone at the same time, all right? Have to ruin a perfectly good question 'cause you're all cowards-\" \"On the count of three,\" the Count called out. \"Everybody ready? Okay. One, two, three!\" The shouts of \"Felicity\" were dulled out by one squeaky, timid \"Gavin\" which tapered out halfway through. Everyone turned their head in the direction of the sound, all mildly confused and-kind of worried or something. Simon had his eyes downcast, boring holes into the table as they all studied him, trying to comprehend the sincerity in his words. Gavin was the first to speak. Clearing his throat, he nodded at Simon, calmly stating with that infamous crooked smile of his, \"And I'm sure it would be a lovely time.\" Title: Time of the Month Character(s): Felicity, Angus, the Count and Carl Rating: K+ because \"she's talking about her period\". Angus sat down at the table that afternoon with his usual gusto and chipperness only to have it dissipate in a matter of seconds as he stared down at the plate of food in front of him. \"Um, Felicity,\" he called out to her, picking up the piece of toast in front of him like it was a dead animal. He held the blackened, crumbling piece of bread almost at arms length, his face twisting in disgust. \"The toast…not really edible.\" Felicity stormed over in a huff, snatching the bread out of his hand and throwing it back on the plate with it's brethren. \"Then make it yourself!\" she snapped loudly, whirling away with the plate and leaving a very scared Angus in her wake. \"What was that all about, Missy Felicity?\" he called out indignantly, watching her violently toss the crusts into the garbage can a few yards away. Her head snapped up, and he felt like he'd just been discovered by an enraged puma. \"Excuse me for having an attitude,\" she said softly, though her eyes were squinted and implied there was a hidden danger behind her words. She straightened up, walking back over to Angus with the plate skillfully resting on one hand. Taking a fistful of crust, she chucked the crispy lunch at him, listening to the food as it fell like sand to the floor. \"EXCUSE ME FOR BURNING YOUR PRECIOUS TOAST, ANGUS! EXCUSE ME FOR MAYBE BEING TIRED!\" she grabbed another fistful of bread, chucking it at Angus, who was now running around the kitchen. \"EXCUSE ME FOR NOT WANTING TO MAKE YOUR TOAST EVERY SODDING DAY OF THE WEEK!\" she barked, chasing him around with the plate of bread. \"Whoa,\" the Count shouted as he made his way into the kitchen with Carl for what was left of lunch. Both Angus and Felicity stopped in their tracks, a handful of bread being squished into her palm. The Count, now having silence the room merely with his regal presence, looked between Felicity and Angus before asking, \"Now what the fuck is going on?\" \"He's an arse!\" Felicity shouted angrily before her frown cracked and she dropped the plate completely and burst into tears. \"You're all arses! I hate cooking and cleaning after you pigs and I just-hate it!\" With a final little whine, she pushed past the Count and slid seamlessly through the door. Carl looked after her astonished. \"Does she always act like that?\" \"Nah,\" the Count said with a shake of the head, looking at the table for something else to eat. \"Just for a couple of days a month.\" \"Let's just say she's got a certain visit from an Aunt Flo,\" Angus said slyly, nodding his head forward as if it added subtlety to what he said. \"Think he's got it,\" the Count said, looking exasperatedly from Angus to Carl Title: Busy Implications Character(s): Mark/John Rating: T for Mark's \"implications\". John situated himself behind the tiny desk at his news station, piling up his reports for the day and straightening and re-straightening the little snippets of news he had picked up during the day. It was his last report of the day before he was free to go. No one needed their news past midnight anyway. Mark was lingering next to John, waiting for the Count to finish up his show so Midnight Mark could swing into action and make the women of England swoon with the sultry sounds of silence. He shot John a look, cigarette hanging carelessly between his lips. \"Got anything lined up for Saturday, John?\" he asked in his perpetually soft and relaxed voice. John chuckled lightly, shrugging his shoulders and adjusting his glasses as he turned his gaze to Mark. \"No, no,\" he laughed, though the laugh had a slight bitter taste. \"I'm completely free this Saturday, just like most Saturdays I spend on the boat. Yes, like the Saturdays I spend just-just reading in the kitchen.\" Mark nodded surprisingly empathetically for someone who slept with over a hundred women in his short twenty-something years on this planet. Putting a hand on John's shoulder, he smirked slightly as he quietly stated, \"Shame I'm not free then.\" Before John could process what that even meant, the Count was out of the studio and Mark was inside, beginning the monologue to his broadcast. John sat there, still feeling where Mark's hand had been on his shoulder just seconds before. His offer buzzed around in his head before sinking like cement into his brain and falling into his throat and making him choke on his own breath. His head snapped upward away from his news articles and he shot a perplexed glance at Mark, now silent as a song began to play. Eventually Mark turned his head and answered John's confusion with a simple wink. Title: Friends Are For Character(s): Felicity/Gavin friendship cuteness Rating: T because of Gavin and…him. It's him. Felicity's sniffling was hard to miss, especially since she'd left her door ajar when she'd decided to skip making breakfast and just stow away in her room. But no one dared ask what was wrong in case one of Felicity's mood swings sent something glass and pointy flying towards their face. Yet the crying and sniffling began to pick away at Gavin, likely because he had to pass the damn room every time he went back to his own little sanctuary upstairs. Additionally, Felicity was a woman and Gavin considered himself a true cherisher of women in all their moods. They were something special, something beautiful that he felt should be revered, not left sniffling and whimpering in their room. Halfway up the stairs towards his room, he stopped and looked at the open door. Gavin, despite his reputation, was a gentleman and more importantly, a gentle man. He considered himself emotional-not in a sappy, feminine way like Simon-but in a compassionate, understanding way. Especially towards women. They opened up to him all the time-literally and figuratively, he thought to himself with a smug smirk. Why should Felicity be any different? Mustering all his courage, for he had heard stories of Felicity's moods, he tapped lightly on the door. \"Felicity?\" he inquired softly, his deep and raspy voice sounding more soothing than even on his broadcasts. She sniffled in reply. He knocked a little louder, clearing his throat and raising his voice slightly. \"Felic-\" \"I heard you,\" she mumbled defeatedly, opening the door a it more and sticking herself in the open space. She looked him up and down, almost like she was disappointed to see him, and sighed. \"What do you want?\" \"Heard you crying all day,\" he said gently, resting his arm against the door frame and looking down at her with this sort of concern he rarely wore on his face. \"Couldn't help but wonder if everything was all right?\" \"Yeah,\" she said, her tone immediately softening as she wiped at her red puffy eyes. She blinked and sniffled, looking at him. \"Just been a-a bad day is all.\" \"Want to talk about it?\" \"No,\" she said simply, shaking her head and looking down at her feet, snuggled in her fluffy pink slippers. \"No, I'm not really up for that.\" Gavin, not one to give up, pushed himself off the door frame and opened his arms. Smiling at her, he tilted his head at the tempting offer. \"Hug then?\" Felicity smiled sadly at him, looking at his open arms for a long moment. \"I don't want to hug. I just want to sniffle and cuddle under my blankets and just let today go by.\" \"You know,\" he said, scratching the back of his neck and shrugging smugly. \"I've been known to be quite the cuddler before.\" \"Really?\" Felicity asked with either a mocked or sincere curiosity, Gavin couldn't tell. \"Oh, yeah,\" he said with another careless shrug. \"Course, it was usually after sex-\" \"Stop, stop,\" Felicity said, waving her hand in front of her face. She loved Gavin, she did, but she certainly didn't need to know about his sex life. She took his hand and pushed her door open. Maybe some company was what she needed to pick her up from this funk. And if Gavin could keep his mouth shut and just hold her, he might be that ideal company. \"We can cuddle, just keep your hands family friendly.\" He smirked, walking into her room. \"I'll try my best.\" \"Oh, you'll succeed,\" she warned sardonically before shutting the door to her room behind her. Title: Ghosts, Words, and Beaded Doors Character(s): Quentin, Carl, and Simon Rating: K, Simon is lovely and keeps it calm. \"You know what I hate?\" Simon said suddenly, putting down the book he was reading on that quiet Sunday afternoon. Only he, Quentin and Carl were on deck, all passively spending their time either reading or writing letters to those on land. \"And what is that?\" Quentin asked, blinking back surprise at Simon's outburst. \"I hate…\" Simon said with a long sigh through his nose, putting his hand out to emphasize his point. \"When you read a sentence once but accidentally skip three words, thereby changing the meaning of the whole sentence?\" He sighed bitterly, looking back at his book and indicating to both Carl and Quentin this had just happened to him. \"And-and then you go back and re-read the sentence correctly, and the whole meaning of the page has changed?\" Carl smirked slightly, looking over at his friend. \"Did that just happen to you?\" \"Lemme tell you, Carl,\" Simon replied sadly, his eyes once again scanning over the pages of his novel. \"This story about this man would have made more sense had I known he was a ghost the whole time.\" Quentin irked a brow. \"They only mention it once?\" \"Well, later, they imply it,\" Simon said, lifting his eyes from the book. \"They talk about him being invisible and such, I just thought they meant that's how he felt.\" \"Makes sense,\" Carl said in agreement, defending the idea. \"Yeah. I mean, when he started walking through doors I was a little confused, but I just assumed everyone had those bead doors. The ones that just…hang there…\" Quentin shook his head in disappointment, sighing. \"You still, I mean,\" Carl countered, looking at Simon. \"You still push those, you know? You can't just walk through them.\" \"You still you know, go through them. I mean you open a door before you go through it,\" he began flipping through the book, scanning for the exact sentence that would prove his point. \"Hah, here we are; 'And with that he walked through the door'.\" \"That doesn't mean he's dead,\" Quentin countered coolly. \"That could simply mean he walked through the doorway.\" \"Is he even dead in that part of the book?\" Carl asked curiously. \"I think so,\" Simon said, flipping around again in the novel, looking for more concrete evidence to support his argument. \"Here's a thought,\" Quentin said matter-of-factly, folding his hands on top of his letters. \"Simon, couldn't you have just misread the sentence…again?\" Simon looked up at him, complete defeat spreading over his face as the words sunk into his ears. Carl patted her shoulder empathetically. \"You're right,\" Quentin continued when his suggestion was met with silence. \"That whole misreading thing sounds dreadful.\" Title: Slow Dance Character(s): Everyone for the most part. Rating: T just in case. \"So…you're telling me,\" Simon said, looking across the table at Carl skeptically. \"That you've never been slow dancing with a girl?\" \"I've never been slow dancing in general,\" Carl said with a sheepish laugh, looking at the table to avoid the awkward staring of the other DJ's. \"You know, I just never found the time for it. I mean, I slow danced with my mum once or twice. Does that count?\" \"No, it doesn't,\" Simon said, shaking his head with a small smile. \"Not…at all,\" Dave agreed. \"Tell you what,\" the Count said, glancing at Carl. \"Since Carl has now found himself a young love in Marianne and might want to actually get her off this crappy ship every once and again, I say, we teach Young Carl over there how to slow dance.\" Carl, no matter how he protested, had no choice in the matter. He was learning to slow dance. \"Now,\" said Dave, resting his hands on both the shoulders of Carl and his dance partner, Felicity. He smiled at them proudly, looking between the two. \"The art of the slow dance is the intimacy or the sensuality of the dance if you prefer-\" \"No, no,\" Simon countered, walking over to the pair of them. \"It's about the romance of the moment. The wonderful, surreal romance of it-\" \"When's the last time you slow danced with anyone?\" Dave interrupted, shoving Simon away. \"Honestly, honestly…some people.\" \"Just let them dance for fuck's sake!\" the Count shouted, watching from the bar. \"Fine, fine,\" Dave said, putting his hands back on their shoulders. \"Remember; intimacy, closeness,\" he said, nodding at both of them. \"Elements of the perfect slow dance.\" He turned to Harold, hovering over the record player and nodded. \"Hit it, good sir.\" Smokey Robinson's soothing voice filled the now otherwise silenced room, and Carl stood there awkwardly, just holding onto one of Felicity's hands and the other one resting on her waist. After only a few seconds, Dave interrupted with a slightly agitated laugh. \"Um, Carl, there's also moving involved in dancing. You know, dancing.\" \"Look how painful that looks,\" Simon argued. \"He looks so…awkward up there…just standing there.\" \"I don't think Felicity is the right partner,\" Angus jumped in with his two cents, acting like he knew simply everything about the slow dance. \"She's a little too…what's the word? Maybe it's the lesbian factorino popping in again, eh fellas?\" \"Felicity-shut up, Angus,\" the Count said, looking over at the pair of them. \"Felicity, get him started. Just the first few steps until he gets the hang of it.\" \"The girl can't lead,\" Dave said with a sigh. \"Otherwise Carl will never get the hang of it.\" \"He can't just stand there,\" Gavin said, gesturing towards the pair of them with his hand. \"Maybe someone should teach him how to do it. Show him how.\" Dave snorted indignantly. \"What do you think I was doing up there?\" Caught up in watching the others argue, Carl was surprised when he felt himself being gently pushed away from Felicity. Turning his head to see who it was, he caught sight of Mark assuming his place as Felicity's dance partner. \"There you go,\" Gavin shouted over whatever the Count and Dave were bickering about. \"There, Mark. Show 'em all how it's done.\" Mark didn't even take two steps before they corrected him. \"No, no,\" Simon said, coming in and taking Mark's place as partner. \"No, see…you're too close to her. Give her a little space.\" \"See, now you're both wrong,\" Dave argued, coming up to join the frenzy. \"I'd like to dance the way Simon wants,\" Felicity finally piped in, rolling her eyes at Dave. \"Thank you,\" Simon said graciously, maintaining his position. \"Now…we should start by taking a step to the left-\" Little did they know, now that Carl had lost the limelight, he'd happily retreated back to his room, safe from the insanity. Title: Cookies Character(s): Everybody Rating: K+ \"All right, who took it?\" Simon said, turning away from the cookie jar and staring at the rest of his comrades. They shared a few confused glances before the Count spoke up. \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" \"The last cookie in the cookie jar,\" Simon said matter of factly, looking over all the possible suspects. It was rare to see Simon even slightly perturbed, especially over something as silly as a cookie. Simon seemed to read their minds, and nodded understandingly. \"I know, I know…it seems….silly, but I've been craving the cookie all darn day.\" Simon looked at the silenced room and continued. \"I said it was mine at breakfast, remember?\" \"Oh,\" the Count said, turning his gaze towards the other DJ's, unable to hide his slight smile. \"Yeah, I do remember you mentioning something about it.\" \"Well, somebody ate it!\" \"Who cares?\" Dave whined with an eye roll, tossing his head back dramatically. \"It's a damn cookie.\" \"Now, hold on,\" Quentin intervened, standing idly off to the side and watching the spectacle. \"If Simon claimed the cookie, he has a right to know who took it. I mean, Felicity makes a damn good cookie.\" Everyone agreed, nodding and looking around at each other…she did make a good cookie. Felicity smiled proudly. \"Well, thank you, Quentin.\" Simon nodded enthusiastically. \"Yes! See! See! Now, who took it? Tell me!\" No one spoke up. \"Be honest,\" he insisted, only to be answered by silence and glances. \"I think,\" Dave said, turning his head and looking at Simon. \"Whoever took the cookie must not have been around at breakfast. Which leads me,\" he said cockily, turning in his chair again. \"To suspect that it was none other than Nutsford.\" He said, looking accusingly at a flabbergasted Angus. \"Now hold on just one second,\" Angus called out, putting his hands up in defense. \"I didn't even know we had cookies up until this very moment! Why wasn't I informed we had cookies?\" \"No, no no no,\" Dave said, shaking his finger in Angus's face. \"Nope. I refuse to believe that you didn't know we had food on here. You're like a little…hungry piglet or something.\" \"Awfully quick to point fingers, David!\" Angus called out indignantly. \"Suspicious behavior from someone as big as you!\" \"Now let's everyone calm down,\" Gavin called out, rubbing the bridge of his nose as silence entered the room once again. \"Now, I think everyone believes deep down that this is…stupid.\" He sighed, looking at Simon. \"It's just a cookie, mate. I really can't believe we're even fighting about this.\" \"It's the principle of the thing!\" Simon said enthusiastically as Dave stood up beside him. \"Odd that Gavin wants to blow the whole thing off,\" Dave whispered to Simon, but loud enough for everyone to hear. \"I think…he stole your cookie.\" Gavin laughed, sitting back in his chair and rolling his eyes. \"Oh, Christ…here we go.\" \"Pointing fingers again, David!\" Angus yelled and stood up, pointing an accusing finger at Dave. \"I'd be pretty nervous if I were you.\" \"Oh, what are you going to do?\" Dave called out defiantly, taking a step towards Nutsford. \"Throw me to the sea for stealing a cookie?\" \"THERE IT IS!\" the Count called out triumphantly. \"Hah!\" Gavin yelled. \"So he admits it!\" Dave turned around quickly, looking at them both. \"Now-now I never admitted to anything-\" \"You bastard!\" Simon called out in shock. \"I trusted you! And all this time you've been the one who stole the cookie!\" Dave put up a hand as if to shield himself from the insults. \"Now, that's a bit out of order, don't you think?\" \"You're out of order!\" Angus bellowed, taking a step towards Dave only to be held back by Carl and Simon. \"CALL ME A LIAR, WILL YA!\" \"Jeez, little guy,\" Simon said, worriedly patting his back. \"It's okay, man, it's okay!\" \"Lady and gentlemen of the jury,\" the Count shouted, slapping his palm on the table and getting the attention of everyone in the room. \"I think we have found a certain Dr. Dave VERY guilty of cookie theft. I thereby conclude that a Mr. Simple Simon should punish him as he sees fit.\" Gesturing from Simon to Dave, he nodded. \"Proceed, good sir.\" \"I…think,\" Simon said, not a malicious bone in his body. \"That perhaps…Dave should make us a batch of cookies.\" The disappointment in Dave's face was revenge in itself. Simon smiled proudly. Title: Sweater Character(s): Gavin/Felicity friendship Rating: K; it's definitely my sweetest friendship bit between the two of them. The ship was empty on that breezy, March afternoon-save for the crew, Felicity, and a very sick Mr. Gavin Kavanagh. Keeping her company in the kitchen while she made some soup for him, he leaned against the counter, looking completely washed out. His eyes were half-opened, vacant and just staring off into the distance while his skin seemed to have lost the color it had once possessed. He had a think coating of sweat on his skin from his broken fever and instead of his usual rather stunning personal wardrobe he wore a loose, think black button down shirt and gray sweats. \"Don't worry,\" she said soothingly as he lowered his head to the counter. She reached out and patted his matted hair. \"After you eat some of this you'll get to party with the boys again.\" He grumbled a laugh, lifting his head slightly to look at her. \"Don't like my company, do you?\" he rasped out, blinking sleepily. \"I quite enjoy the company,\" she said with a small smile, turning back to the broth and stirring it slowly. \"You know, it's not often you boys join me on Monday afternoons. And, I mean, it's not my ideal romantic company, but…it's nice.\" She said, turning her head and giving him another smile. \"You're a good girl, Felicity,\" he said, resting his head on the counter again for only a moment before lifting it abruptly. He let out a shaky breath and stared at her, almost confused at his own thoughts. \"I hope you can forgive me for this, but…suddenly I'm not…in the mood-\" \"-for food?\" she continued with an arched brow, not surprised at all. If he was sick, he was sick and his hunger was likely to be inconsistent. And the newly green tint to his face and the tightening of his lips definitely implied he'd be expelling food sooner then taking it in. Though she wished he'd gotten sick a little earlier, she thought for a brief bitter second. Turning off the stove and dropping her wooden spoon, she walked around the counter. \"Course I'm not mad at you. What's a little wasted broth and vegetables and chick-never mind,\" she sighed, grabbing onto his arm and helping him to his feet. \"Want to lie down for awhile?\" He nodded slowly, trying to hold something in-and Felicity didn't want to push him. \"Right,\" she said with forced happiness, taking his arm and helping him from the kitchen to the stairs and all the way across the ship to his room. When they reached his door, she looked back at him and he looked worse for wear-his green tint had faded and had been replaced with a new coating of sweat and shivering limbs. \"Oh,\" Felicity said aloud, catching his attention. Her face turned slightly disgusted as she studied him longer. \"Oh, you look positively dreadful.\" \"I'm freezing,\" he mumbled, stumbling around her and slamming his body into the door and knocking it open. He flopped onto his bed, his face buried into his pillow. Felicity twisted her face in worry. \"Hey there,\" she whispered softly, coming over and rubbing his shoulder. \"Want a sweater or something?\" \"I don't own any,\" he said, his face still buried in the pillow, Felicity thought perhaps a measure to prevent his teeth from chattering. Felicity paused, an unorthodox idea popping into her head. \"Well…I own sweaters.\" He turned his head slightly. \"You must be joking.\" \"No! No, I'll be right back!\" she said, going out the door. It was an odd idea, yes, but it would definitely work. There was a height difference between them certainly, with her being barely five-five and him being six-three, but who would care? It's not like he was parading the sweater around the ship. None of the other guys were there to make fun of him. \"Don't!\" she heard him bellow weakly, but she was already in her room, digging through her piles of discarded sweaters before she settled on a rather large white wool sweater, with big fake flowers stitched along the front. He'd probably be…unhappy with the choice, but it would help. She popped her head back in his door moments later. He'd managed to roll onto his back and looked at the sweater sleepily with a hint of disappointment. \"No,\" he said quietly, looking from the sweater to her. \"No way am I wearing that.\" \"Oh come on,\" Felicity coaxed impatiently, opening up the sweater and walking over to him. \"The boys aren't here to laugh at you. Besides, you need to get better. Your sick broadcasts are just not the same.\" \"I have jackets-\" \"Who sleeps in a jacket?\" she said, shaking the sweater slightly. \"Now come on. It's cozy.\" Gavin sighed, looking from her to the sweater once again before pushing himself up. \"Fine,\" he mumbled. \"But no one must know about this.\" \"Of course not,\" Felicity agreed unconvincingly, helping him slide the still too small sweater over his arms. \"Oh…look at you,\" she said encouragingly, though she couldn't help but grin. \"You look…dashing.\" He looked up at her smile and found himself smiling half-heartedly in return. \"I am Gavin Kavanagh,\" he said coolly, lying back down on his back and adding dramatically. \"The one man in the world who can pull off flower sweaters.\" \"You're feeling better already,\" Felicity said with a smile. Title: Honest Character(s): Carl, Mark and John with implied Rating: T because of them. \"Have you ever said that you love a girl?\" Carl asked Mark, leaning in the doorway of the studio during a rather long record. Mark looked up at Carl, slowly spinning in his chair to face him. \"Loads of times,\" he said simply. John chimed in knowingly, coming to stand in the doorway as well after clearly eavesdropping on their conversation. \"How many times have you meant it?\" Mark irked a brow, looking John right in the eye. \"Never.\" John nodded, smiling smugly and returning to his little studio. \"What was that about?\" Carl asked, but Mark was back to work before the question could fully be asked.

In fact, he might be the only expert in his area. There were many lawyers, but there was only one Dominic Twatt. He was a veritable encyclopaedia of laws, regulations and precedents. This he combined with a faultless understanding of the letter of the law, seeing every possible back door and bypass. His name was not well-known with the public: indeed, he had never appeared in a court room (and didn't intend to do so: he could imagine the reaction of the jury when his name would be announced and he preferred to keep it by imagining). Most of his clients had been in fact other lawyers, mostly employed by large companies or wealthy individuals, who were looking for a hole in the web of the law. He had worked like that for years before the government had decided to recruit him, figuring that, if he could not be stopped, they could at least use him. It had been his job to reread law propositions and point out the flaws. His reputation, as far as he was aware, was one of an intelligent, quiet and efficient man, who would get the job done without a fuss. He was also known as unflappable and completely unaware of the humorous side to his surname. In truth, he was very much aware of it – after all, he had spent the largest part of his childhood on public schools. He had simply found that people got flabbergasted if he pretended not to understand when they chuckled. Apart from the amusement derived from their expression, it gave him the advantage at the start of the conversation. He then simply had to retain it instead of gain it. So he wasn't truly surprised when Sir Alistair Dormandy turned to him to stop the pirate radios. In fact, there were few situations where he would truly be speechless. He was however now. \" Happens to the best of us, mister Twatt. Happens to the very best of us.\" Next there was only the loud tone of the phone in his ear. Dominic exhaled loudly, at a loss of what to do. They might die. \"Sir?\" The officer in charge of the operation looked at him expectantly. He dumbly shook his head and the man immediately gave a curt nod back. \"Attention! We return to the barracks!\" he bellowed even as he whirled around on his heels. Immediately there was a flurry of movement as the troops broke up. The commander turned back. \"Do you need to be dropped off anywhere, sir?\" Dominic shook his head again, turning to look out over the dark sea. Somewhere, far out of his sight, the men he had glimpsed on that boat so long ago, were drowning. He heard the clicking of heels and no doubt the man saluted once more, but he didn't bother looking. He was trying desperately to come up with a plan. With a flick of his hand he took a decision – it probably would not lead to anything, but he'd try anyhow. He returned to the pay phone and started pushing coins in again. The phone started ringing. Part of him was still wondering what he was doing – he was calling the office in the middle of the night. There would be nobody there. Click. \"Sir Dormandy's office, how can I help?\" \"Miss C?\" he asked, disbelief evident in his voice. \"Mister Twatt?\" She sounded as surprised as he was. \"What's going on? Aren't you responding to the distress call?\" \"How do you know –\" he halted. She listened to Radio Rock. Of course. Apart from him and the Cabinet, everybody seemed to. \"Never mind,\" he continued quickly, \"Miss C, we have a problem. The Minister wouldn't give me permission to go out again. The operation is done.\" He stopped, trying to remain calm. \"I don't know a way around that.\" They might die. \"The soldiers have already gone?\" There was also panic evident in her voice. \"Yes.\" He dragged a hand through his hair. \"I – oh dear God – I can't believe he would –\" the last sounded more indignant. \"Oh, never mind that. Look, where are you?\" He blinked, surprised by the sudden determination in her voice, and replied. \"Good. Look, I have two friends, they don't have a boat of their own, but they do know how to sail. I'll call them immediately. Wait there and get a boat. Then you can go out and – just get a boat from somewhere, okay?\" \"Done,\" he promised without thinking and next there was a click as the receiver was put down. He whirled around, intending to look for a suitable boat to steal (commandeer, a part of his mind pointed out and immediately cited several laws which would support this term). His gaze fell on two policemen who were standing a bit further on the quay. They were both looking at him. \"Yes?\" he asked loudly over the hammering of the blood in his ears. He kept his eyes firmly on the first ray of boats, dismissing several as too little or too old. One coughed and stepped forward, looking a bit awkward. \"'scuse me, mister Twatt, sir, but...\" Dominic now recognised them as Sergeant Stilt and Constable Powell. They had been dispatched from the local police force to help with the operation, namely point out where the ship was anchored. His heart pummelled – it was impossible that anyone had foreseen he would call Miss C, Dormandy couldn't possibly have sent them to keep an eye on him... \"Marvin and I both listen to Radio Rock, sir,\" the man continued in an obvious attempt at bravery that would have been amusing in any other situation. \"And well, sir...\" he trailed off, sweat gathering on his brow. Powell stepped forward to prod his superior with an elbow, throwing a nervous look in Dominic's direction. \"We both feel it is wrong to leave them out there, sir,\" Stilt finished in a rush and then apparently stopped breathing. Powell was nodding violently next to him. Dominic gritted his teeth and ignored them, looking out over the harbour. His eye fell on a large yacht and a small disbelieving smile flitted over his face. It was a stupid idea, but... \"I plan on commandeering a vessel to save the members of Radio Rock,\" he said suddenly, turning back to the policemen. They both jumped slightly at being addressed. \"The operation would be illegal and going against a direct order.\" He was silent for a moment, catching sight of a pair of car lights coming down to the harbour. \"If you're willing to join,\" he continued slower, as the lights disappeared and two car doors slammed, \"you are most welcome.\" Without waiting for an answer, he turned on his heels and started running in the direction of two pair of quick footsteps. A tall, thin man and a sturdy woman loomed up from the darkness. \"Dominic Twatt?\" the man asked in a rush. His sharp, confirming nod was met with an offered hand. \"Kevin and Evelyn Mallory. Doris called us,\" he said quickly as they shook hands. Dominic gave another nod. \"These are Sergeant Stilt and Constable Powell. They are joining us.\" He saw Mallory's raised eyebrows and followed his gaze: Stilt was pale again and Powell had resumed his enthusiastic nodding. He sighed but instead pointed at the yacht. \"Can you work with that?\" They both looked at it for a moment and then both answered in the affirmative. \"Good. Let's go.\" Dominic quickly opened the latch on a small door in the railing and reached out a hand. The drowning man clamped onto it, nearly pulling him into the water. He felt more than saw Powell and Stilt jump forward, one tugging at his coat, the other reaching out to the man in the water. With combined forces, they managed to get the man on the deck, where he sprawled out on his back, gasping for breath. Only then Dominic recognised the owner of the radio station. The man slowly sat up, coughing and swearing under his breath. Funnily enough, he had managed to hold on to a thin designer shawl that was draped over his thick sailor's coat. He sniffed once and then looked up to them as Kevin and Evelyn came running from the steering cabinet. Dominic saw him look Stilt and Powell up and down, but he seemed to find it impolite to remark upon their uniforms. His gaze slid to Dominic who suddenly felt a jittering in his stomach he hadn't experienced since his first school day. The man frowned and then smiled in recognition. \"Ah. The twat. Hello again.\" \"Hello.\" Dominic felt his cheeks warm. To save face, he quickly offered a hand as the other man got to his feet. \"Thank you.\" The man took off the thin shawl and wrung it out. \"And thank you for coming to our aid,\" he added as water splattered on the deck. \"Including the arm of the law, of course,\" the last was said with a glance at Stilt and Powell. Dominic quickly threw a look in their direction. Both had apparently realised that they were visibly outsiders, with their police uniform and bobby caps, and now looked distinctly uneasy. \"Ah, thank you. Much obliged,\" this the man said to Evelyn, who spread a large pink towel on his shoulders. She caught his gaze and said apologetically: \"It was the only thing I could find quickly.\" Dominic blinked and looked at the towel again with a frown. Then he blinked again. It wasn't so much a towel as a bedspread. A very expensive looking bedspread. Which was being used to towel up salt water. And a bit of seaweed. Dominic felt backwards for the railing and slowly sat down on one of the wooden benches that bordered the railing. He was aware only on an unconscious level of the surprised stares, as he was too busy berating himself internally for this colossally stupid, stupid idea. What had he been thinking picking this boat out of all the ones in the harbour... \"You alright, sir?\" he heard Stilt ask. \"You look a bit peaky.\" Dominic careful cleared his throat. \"I should perhaps point out,\" he said carefully, \"That Constable Powell, Sergeant Stilt and I are not present. There was a failed government attempt to shut down Radio Rock and after that all participants went home. We do not partake in any civilian action to help the crew of this radio station. And,\" he continued quickly when Evelyn opened her mouth in the corner of his eye, \"Minister Dormandy's private yacht isn't here either.\" The sudden silence was punctuated by the cheering that was still going on on the other boats. Then there was high-pitched shriek and Powell disappeared under one of the benches, keeping up a litany of complaints. \"I didn't know that, you didn't say it was his ship, oh God, have you any idea what he did to old Jonesy for smoking on the job?! You should have said, I don't want to die!\" Stilt had chosen what was probably the lesser option, namely freezing in place, face ashen and mouth opened in a silent scream. The ex-owner of the boat looked around carefully, studying the yacht. Kevin and Evelyn followed his example, even though they had been on it for the last hour. \"This is Dormouse's?\" Dominic latched onto the changed topic gratefully. \"You call him Dormouse?\" \"– never knew, there are some of us who have children to think of! Alright, so I'm not one of them, but that doesn't make any difference, oh help –\" \"Well, Andy, his big brother did,\" the man sniffed, using the bedspread to towel his hair. Dominic resolutely kept his eyes averted. \"Never knew him personally. I don't look for people who even in their first year were described as soporific.\" Dominic gave a small laugh and the man smiled. \"I'm Quentin. I owned that,\" he gestured to the sinking ship. \"Dominic. I wrote the Marines Broadcasting Offences Act,\" he returned drily. \"Ah. Charming piece of legislation, I've heard. Impossible to get around,\" Quentin said politely over Powell's lamentations. Dominic chuckled. \"Thank you.\" Quentin nodded, seemingly unshaken, and went to sit next to him. \"Erm, excuse me.\" Evelyn stepped forward, looking intently at the soaked man. \"Aren't you the one who said' fuck' on the air?\" Dominic watched the other man flinch. \"Well, yes, but in my defence, I was tricked. I truly had no idea the fuckers had let the mike on.\" \"It was brilliant!\" Kevin now interjected, grinning broadly. \"Best piece of radio I've ever heard!\" He held out a hand. \"Kevin Mallory, sir, and this is my wife Evelyn.\" \"How d' you do.\" They shook hands. \"And just Quentin will do.\" \"Well, I was glad we'd sent the kids out, I can tell you that!\" Stilt seemed to have slightly defrosted from his Munchen-imitation. His right eye was still twitching, but at least he was speaking again. \"A bit more warning would have been nice.\" He looked at Quentin, hesitated and then also offered a hand. \"Sergeant Arthur Stilt.\" They shook. \"I'm Marvin Powell.\" Powell warily peered from under the bench. \"And if I get arrested for this, I'd like somebody to warn my mother.\" \"I'm sure it won't come that far,\" Evelyn tried gently. \"In fact, if you put off your helmets, I'm sure no one will notice you're not civilians.\" \"You think so?\" Stilt asked hopefully. Powell apparently did not need the conformation, as he was already trying to pry it off under continuous swearing. \"Definitely,\" Kevin assured him. Put at ease, Stilt started to fiddle with the strap under his chin. Powell was cursing again, now because he had hit his uncovered head against the wooden bench. Next to Dominic, Quentin gave a deep chuckle. \"Excuse me for a moment, I need to go and inspect my troops.\" He removed the bedspread and gently put it on the bench before getting up and turning to the open sea. He stilled. Dominic followed his gaze. The last of the Radio Rock boat was disappearing under the surface, the sea bubbling for a moment longer before calming. Silence was spreading over the many boats. Then a man broke through the surface. When everything had quieted down somewhat after the burly man had been dragged aboard a ship, Quentin moved to the railing again. He raised his arms, but was halted at Powell's cry: \"Wait a minute!\" The man dived under the bench again, rummaged around and came up triumphantly (but with a small 'fuck!' as he had hit his head again) with a megaphone in a hand. Still knelt, he offered it to Quentin, who accepted it with a smile. \"Thank you. Ingenious idea.\" While Powell was practically glowing, the standing man raised the megaphone. \"Attention everyone!\" There was an immediate response of clapping and cheering. Some people called Quentin's name. \"Thank you, thank you. I thought I'd better check if everybody is still among the living. It looks like the Count is alright at any rate –\" more cheers. From one of the furthest boats, a man hollered back: \"You bet I am!\" Quentin raised a hand in acknowledgement. \"Alright. Is Gavin here?\" Women's screams were heard. \"I'll take that as a yes.\" Dominic smiled at that, dragging a hand through his hair absentmindedly as he looked out over the sea. Quentin kept calling out a long list of names, which was each met with applause. \"Young Carl?\" \"I'm here!\" a young man on a smaller boat close by waved. \"Angus Nutsford?\" \"Present!\" \"Ah. Well, you can't have everything, I suppose.\" \"Oi!\" \"And finally: Mark? Is Mark here?\" A dark figure a while away saluted. \"Alright. Everybody seems to be here. So shall we return to the coast?\" There was a great deal of cheering, but a voice boomed back over the water: \"Hang on a bit there, Captain!\" \"Yes, Count?\" Quentin shouted back. \"I'm allergic to quiet!\" There was another salvo of laughter. \"That can be arranged, my good man!\" a tall figure on a sailing boat yelled. \"We have a megaphone and a record player here. Give me a minute!\" It took less than that before music drifted over the water. Evelyn started moving along to it and Quentin was tapping the rhythm out on the railing. \"Martha and the Vendellas,\" Dominic heard him murmur, \"wonderful.\" He raised the megaphone one last time. \"Let's dance!\" It had been the night after his failed attempt at espionage. He had been unable to go asleep, turning over the day in his mind. He kept going back to the only conversation he had had with a Radio Rock member: the older man, who apparently wasn't a DJ or anything alike. \" You look like a twat.\" He didn't know whether to be amused or embarrassed. Or maybe even bothered. He had always been Twatt, but he had never thought of himself as a twat. Did other people view him in the same way? The sniggering behind his back when he went up the stairs again hadn't really helped. In the end, he decided to give up. He had taken another whiskey (against his normal routine: he normally only drank one at nine o'clock pm every evening) and settled down on the couch. He never thought of it as his couch: he had bought the apartment furnished as he was rather unconcerned about colour schemes. Nevertheless, he never seemed to be truly comfortable, even though the rooms were nicely furnished in the latest trend, all white and black. Maybe it was because he had grown up in the small, cramped rooms of his parents' house in Suffolk and after that in the sparely furnished dorms of the public schools. He just needed to settle in. He'd get used to it. Then again, he'd been trying to get used to it for the last ten years. After a couple of sips, he had hesitantly put on the radio and changed the channel. The music on Radio Rock was cheerful and a woman was... not singing, as there seemed to be no words to the song, but she wasn't vocalising either. His resolution to listen only a minute and then go to bed again disappeared like smoke as he listened in fascination as the woman did not sing along, but seemed to become an instrument as well. Without conscious thought, he shifted forward in his seat as the cheerful song became a slow lullaby. It was still the same woman's voice, but now there were lyrics. He couldn't do much else but clutch his glass, his head feeling warm, as a man's voice informed him that he had just listened to Ella Fitzgerald, performing Flying Home and Dream a Little Dream of Me. Next there were instrumental numbers, not as sophisticated as some classical works, but which nevertheless seemed to create a picture as lively as any masterpiece. They were slowness and water and foreign and heat and he was utterly enthralled by it... He woke up with a start as what sounded like a horn coming from the radio. An overly cheery and high-pitched voice asked him to stay for the \"funtime\" after the news. The last was alright, just up till the last item, upon which he resolved to buy a newspaper as soon as possible. (Cuneo was a town in Italy, true, but he doubted the local dialect was called cuni lingus .) After that he turned the radio off – people who said \"funtime\" in that tone of voice seemed to be rather too close to insanity. The enchantment of last night had gone. Indeed, he felt rather silly for having listened to it. There was nothing there that couldn't be expressed by classical music, he was fairly certain. He simply hadn't found the right work yet. The next night, he didn't turn the radio to Radio Rock again. Dominic made his way to the elevator, one of the last to leave. He was brooding and it was probably visible on his face, as the few people still present left him wide berth. Normally, he would hide his expression, especially if he felt upset, but today he really couldn't care. He was this close to handing in his resignation. The Minister had been in a foul mood for the last two weeks ever since Radio Rock had sunk. And as Dominic had been taken into service especially to deal with that problem, he apparently was the only one to blame. Hardly a day went by without him getting called 'arse' and he got nothing but the tedious, easy tasks any intern could have done. As he passed by her office, he ignored the small, beckoning wave Miss C gave him. She had been trying to get his attention the entire day now, but he really didn't feel like getting another inane task just before he left. The elevator arrived and he stepped inside. Imagine that, being angry because people didn't die , he thought viciously, as he pressed the button for the ground floor and the doors started closing again. To his irritation, Miss C slipped inside at the last moment. He stared forwards, set on ignoring her, but he could feel her eyes on his face, clearly intent on relaying her message. One floor lower, he conceded. \"Yes, Miss C?\" He kept his voice cold and refused to look at her, hoping in vain she'd get the idea. \"I was wondering... I don't suppose you still have contact with any of the people of Radio Rock?\" The question was so unexpected that he actually forgot his resolution and looked aside. She was looking up at him in fierce desperation, wringing her hands. His astonishment must have been visible on his face, for she continued quickly: \"Because Kevin said you and that man were talking for quite a while –\" \"No, we didn't,\" he interrupted, nearly defensively. \"I haven't seen him since.\" He quickly regretted his outburst when she visibly deflated. For a moment it looked like she would cry. \"But Evelyn said you gave him your coat...\" \"His own was wet,\" he explained awkwardly. \"It seemed more prudent to give him mine.\" He shifted, turning to her more fully. \"What's going on?\" Her eyes shifted around the small space. He suppressed the urge to do the same. They were alone, for god's sake. \"He's planning an action against them.\" The words tumbled out. \"For breaking the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act. And...\" she swallowed, \"he's meddling with the appointment of the magistrate. He's trying to – to get Judge Kay.\" Dominic was speechless. That was... He had known the Minister to be vicious, but to do something illegal... It was possible, of course, he knew that. Judge John Kay liked to be in Court most of the year, especially when others took a holiday. If the court days were planned right and the evidence gathering took just enough time, there was ninety – ninety and a half , the more accurate part of his mind corrected – percent chance that Kay would be the magistrate appointed. But it wouldn't be a fair trial. Kay was perhaps the only man in the entirety of Britain who hated pirate radios more than the Minister. It was rumoured he knew the entire libretto of Mozart's Don Giovanni by heart. Dominic looked away, trying to refind his balance, to think of a course of action. Trying to prove what the Minister was doing would be neigh on impossible. He had worked for the man long enough to know there would be no trail to follow back. \"I'll try and find them,\" he promised, hardly realising what he said. \"They have to be warned.\" Dormandy was probably going for the surprise effect, he thought as he started pacing. That was what he would do. He'd work in secret on the case until it was watertight and all evidence was gathered. And then he'd jump the unsuspecting victim. If the element of surprise was gone, however... If they could get a lawyer, perhaps lengthen the investigation until more judges were present... Well, things could turn out quite differently. \"You will?\" Miss C's relief was tangible. \"That's wonderful, Dominic.\" He answered her smile without thinking. \"Well, it needs to be done, doesn't it?\" He stopped his pacing. \"Doris, isn't it?\" She went red, but kept smiling. \"Yes. Yes, it is.\" Silence reigned until they reached the ground floor. As the doors opened, she suddenly held out a hand. \"Well, good luck.\" He shook it. \"Thank you.\" He turned around and exited the building without looking back. A thought flitted through his head, something about loyalty and sabotaging his own employer, but it was quickly buried under strategies and courses of action and the memory of a tall man wearing his coat. A couple of days later, he was a lot less enthusiastic. He had searched half London, walking in and out of pubs, looking for faces he recognised. He often would stay out till two, three o'clock before collapsing in his bed. Every morning, Miss C would give him a hopeful look, but every time he had had to shake his head and see her face crumple. His frustration had only upped another notch when he noticed he could not search the government files as had been his plan – it now required a code, which would mean it would be noticed if he attempted it. All he could do was roam the streets of London in the assumption that the DJs would prefer the noise of the metropolis and would be in search of alcohol. This is the last one, he thought as he opened the door to the Underground Bar . It was nearing half past two and he was bone tired. He looked around the dimly lit room – austere, minimalistic design; polished black surfaces; soft jazz coming out of discretely placed speakers; colourful drinks in high steeled glasses; quietly talking people in designer clothes – more out of habit than truly expecting to find something. And froze. A young bartender, hardly more than a boy, was pouring a drink for a young lady in a small black dress. The bar seat and the dress probably cost more than anything Dominic was currently wearing, but that was not what got his attention. The bartender was lanky, pale and had bangs that fell into his eyes. When Dominic had seen him last, he had been wet but content, climbing up the yacht to hug Quentin. Young Carl. Dominic made his way to the bar, not sitting down when he got there. Carl turned to him, smiling. \"What can I do for you, sir?\" Dominic drew in a breath. \"I need to talk to Quentin.\" It was interesting to see how quickly the boy's expression just shut down. He rested his arms on the bar. \"And why is that, sir?\" His tone was still polite, but all the previous warmth was gone. The girl to Dominic's left had stopped drinking. Her face was heart-shaped and she was rather pretty. Or she would be if she wouldn't be trying to kill him with her look. \"Look –\" Dominic pinched the bridge of his nose. The fatigue, which had disappeared temporarily when he had recognised Carl, came back full force. He was too tired for this. \"They're starting a lawsuit against you,\" he said bluntly. \"All the members of Radio Rock. You need to get a lawyer. Just tell him that, will you?\" The girl and Carl exchanged a look. \"Who is the message from?\" the girl asked in a clear voice. She was still narrowing her eyes at him. \"He knows me as Dominic,\" he replied immediately. \"Or –\" he faltered, for the first time since Eton reluctant to divulge his full name. He settled for a compromise. \"The twat. I got him out of the water.\" The girl smirked and he narrowed his eyes at her for a change. He was tired, his feet ached and he was trying to help . \"Just tell him that, will you?\" he said curtly and made to leave. He wanted to sleep. \"Hang on.\" A hand grasped his coat. He turned and saw something that resembled recognition in Carl's expression. \"Can you get here tomorrow? At five?\" \"I can't,\" he replied gruffly. \"I only finish then.\" \"Half past then,\" the boy proposed, undeterred. Dominic hesitated and then nodded stiffly. A smile immediately bloomed in answer and for a heartbeat, he was unsettled at how much Carl reminded him of Quentin. \"Good. We'll see you then.\" He regained his balance, gave another curt nod and swept out. When Dominic stepped through the door of the Underground Bar for the second time, everything fell silent. In the otherwise empty bar, there were sitting more than ten people. Some looked ridiculously out of place (the woman who was wearing something bright yellow was an outright eyesore), others looked completely at home (a long figure with sunglasses and a feathered hat had draped himself over one of the small couches in a corner). All of them were staring at him. \"Ah, the twat. Would you like some tea?\" Quentin was sitting in the back at a small, black table that was pushed against the wall. He was gently stirring a cup of tea, which seemed to be made of rather delicate china. There was another teacup standing before the empty seat opposite him. Dominic moved again. \"Yes, please.\" He slowly made his way past the staring members of Radio Rock – for he supposed that was who they were – and sat down in the empty chair. If he turned his head, he could survey the entire room. On the other hand, they only had to stare ahead of themselves to keep an eye on him and they were all doing so unapologetically. Even the two men in shades, the one with the feathered hat and the burlier one in a leather jacket next to him, seemed to study him. Well, he was used to plenty of bullying. He could handle a bit of intimidation. He looked back at Quentin and unconsciously straightened his back. The older man was wearing a cream-colored suit with a soft green shirt underneath. There was no tie, but a scarf in the same green was lying haphazardly over the back of his chair. The man truly was a dandy . \"Milk or sugar?\" \"Sugar. Just the one.\" \"Ah. I had taken you for a milk person.\" Quentin's hand, which had been reaching for the milk can, dwelt back to the sugar lumps. He added a spoon and handed the cup to Dominic with an elegant gesture. \"Now, I understand we are to be brought before court?\" It was said nonchalantly, as if discussing the weather. Dominic gently put the saucer down and took a deep breath. And started to talk. When he had finished, a large man with glasses asked: \"Can they do that? Choose the judge?\" Dominic turned to him. \"Officially not, but there are a lot of things they can influence: the date, the court...\" he shrugged. \"Plus, Kay likes taking cases. He thinks his moral compass is infallible.\" \"Why is he bad?\" this question came from a ginger man with a high voice. He reminded Dominic strangely of a rodent. \"He is known for supporting legislation banning pop music,\" he answered. \"And he's the biggest Wagner fan in the entirety of Britain.\" \"How do we know this is true?\" the sturdy woman in yellow asked suspiciously. \"You don't,\" he replied impatiently. \"Kay is certainly a classical music man,\" Quentin mused. Dominic turned back to him. He was lazily stirring his tea. \"Used to insist on playing Bach all through the night. And he had a stuffed deer in his room,\" the older man remembered. \"And not to hide stash in either. I don't even think he had stash.\" There was a moment of silence. Dominic was wondering if he should ask what the stash was of, but before he could decide whether that was wise a small man in glasses and a brown suit asked: \"Why a deer?\" Quentin shrugged. It was not, Dominic noted, a normal shrug, where you would consciously lift and lower your shoulders. Qentin lifted one shoulder and then seemed to find it too much trouble to slowly lower it again. Instead, he just dropped it. \"Family tradition, I believe. They're a rather old family. His brother is officially Lord Kay. They do everything, y'know,\" he made a vague handgesture, \"hunting, a manor, house maids and butlers, calling people 'old sport'... They're only a few generations away from absolute insanity.\" He coughed. \"Now, does anyone else have a question for mister the twat?\" Sunglasses-Leather Jacket turned to Sunglasses-Feathered Hat. They seemed to communicate in silence. Hat nodded and Jacket turned back to him and Quentin. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Count?\" Quentin inquired politely. The Count slowly exhaled a cigarette cloud of enormous proportions. \"Why are you telling us? Since you know, you work for them and all?\" Dominic blinked. Strangely enough, he had been prepared for every kind of question, but this one hadn't been among them. For a moment, he searched for words. \"I – it wouldn't be right,\" he said finally. \"You broke the law, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get a proper trial. It's all being done so – so underhanded and unfair. Plus... the Minister... he'd had left you to die on that boat. It – It's just not right,\" he finished helplessly. Silence reigned again. Dominic hadn't felt this ridiculous in a long time and had to stop himself from shifting in his seat. The Count took his cigarette from between his lips and spoke. \"That has got to be the crappiest answer ever.\" \"Too true, my foulmouthed friend.\" Sunglasses-Feathered Hat put up a cigarette and gave Dominic a broad grin. \"I believe him.\" The Count slowly nodded. \"Aye.\" \"Aye,\" Carl agreed. One by one, everyone in the room repeated the word (except for a young man with curls, who simply nodded). Dominic followed it, eyes large and with a feeling of having missed something. At the end, Quentin smiled. \"Good. Now that is settled, why don't you all, y'know,\" a lazy hand made a shooing motion, \"bugger off?\" There was some laughter and a few salutes as Dominic released a breath he hadn't known he had been holding. Next there was the scraping of chairs and a low murmur of voices. The Count, Feathered Hat and an older man with glasses and a beard relocated to a table with records. The silent youngster with curls took out a pack of cards while the heavy man with glasses protested: \"I'm not playing with you anymore man, your poker face is just –\". Others simply moved to different tables and struck up a conversation. Dominic turned back to Quentin, who was watching him over the rim of his cup. \"They wanted to see if you were trustworthy,\" the other man explained without waiting for the question. \"They've decided you are.\" He put the cup down. \"Now –\" \"I'm not telling you anything else,\" Dominic interrupted. Quentin raised his eyebrows and he immediately softened his tone. \"I mean, I just want things to go fairly, not start spying for the other side.\" He contemplated for a moment. \"I am willing to tell you when he's crossing the line, but no more than that.\" Quentin seemed to mull this over and then gave a half-shrug. \"Okay.\" Dominic felt out of his depth again. He had expected obstinacy, wheedling, perhaps even a half-veiled threat. Not this easy acceptance. These people seemed to be good at throwing him off. \"The thing is,\" Quentin continued, oblivious to Dominic's confusion, \"I don't really know all that much about the law. I studied economics myself. I was hoping for some background.\" He was silent for a moment and then looked up hopefully. \"How about I ask you a question and you tell me the answer if you feel it's alright for me to know?\" Dominic frowned, considering the concept. He couldn't find anything wrong with it however. \"Alright,\" he agreed, a bit hesitantly. The man opposite beamed. \"Wonderful! Now, what can you tell me about the Broadcasting Marines Offences Act?\" That evening, he spoke for another hour. Quentin wanted not just the text, but all the implications, other victims of the law, who had supported it and who hadn't. They switched to other topics, though still in the area of law, with Dominic hardly noticing. And when Carl shouted \"Time's up!\", which apparently meant they all had to leave, Quentin shook his hand and somehow extracted a promise that they would meet again next week, same time, same place. Then he winked and left the younger man standing on the pavement, feeling slightly squirmish and suppressing the urge to smile. Their meetings went on, every Friday, for another month. The Underground Bar apparently belonged to a friend of Carl's mother (he didn't inquire any further: Dave's waggled eyebrows made more than enough clear). As Carl had turned out to be a natural cocktail maker and Mark looked after the background music, the group was allowed to hang around before opening hours. Dominic often arrived slightly before Quentin in the bar, but there were always members of Radio Rock present, who now seemed to regard him as part of – well, perhaps not the group, but nevertheless a fixed... protuberance of the group, so to speak. He got sometimes included in conversations and he always got addressed by \"mister the twat\". They greeted him when he came in and greeted him when he left. When he calmly stated he vastly preferred classical music, they all seemed to decide he simply hadn't heard enough modern music. All through his conversation with Quentin he got asked \"And how about this one?\" as they put on yet another record. Finally, a bit despairing, he admitted to listening to Radio Rock once, and if they could just play the genre they had played between four and six o'clock in the morning, please? This got Bob beaming, who had apparently been the DJ at that time of night. But, as Dominic couldn't help but point out to the Count, Simon and Young Carl, he hadn't truly liked the morning programme (\"That's Angus,\" the Count said. \"He only gets special people,\") and their news was mostly fiction. (He didn't mention which exact item he had doubted and the fact that nobody disputed his claim was enough. Though it had to be said that John threw an accusing look in the Count's direction.) Apart from all that, there were the conversations with Quentin, who wanted to know, well, nearly everything . From broad views to obscure little facts and from interpretation to precise phrasings. He didn't mind it, not even when he noticed that he fairly often accidentally included bits about his personal life and the older man did not comment upon them. It was... nice, that someone would listen to him with such attention. So, when at the end of the month, Quentin pushed a note with an address in his hand and asked him to be there next Monday, he did not argue. Again, he found himself in a state of surprise. If he had pictured anything in his mind, it would have been a crossover between the Underground Bar and his own apartment: modern, with glass and metal. Instead, when he had parked outside the hedge between the other cars and had walked through the gate, he found a lovely, slightly wild garden and an old farmhouse in red brick. The only sign that he had not misread Quentin's languid scrawl was the drifting sound of rock'n'roll coming from beyond the open front door. When he stepped inside, the first thing he noticed (couldn't help but noticing) was how very crowded it was. People were moving around in the room, yes, but they had to push other people away to do so. (He could see Angus for example when two giggling women bent towards each other. It looked as if he were trying to chat up a girl. The girl looked as if she was trying to find means of escape, violence allowed if necessary.) Most of the people were also people he had never seen before. \"Drink?\" Dominic started. In this crowd, it should have been impossible for a sturdy man like the Count to sneak up on anyone, but the American had somehow managed. He was also offering him one of two hellishly yellow drinks. \"Thank you,\" Dominic replied, not entirely sure if he should be thankful. The liquid resembled paint more than something ingestible. He looked out over the people again, trying to see above their heads. (Mark was talking with a girl in a nearby corner, he saw from the corner of his eye. Well, perhaps not so much talking as getting talked at .) \"You wouldn't happen to know where –\" \"The back garden, in the sun.\" The Count took a large gulp of the glass. \"He's like them, y'know, lizards? Has to soak up energy before he can move.\" \"Alright.\" Dominic looked back at the Count, feeling awkward. Apparently he had become see-through obvious since making the Radio Rock crew's acquaintance. \"Do you mind if I –\" The Count shrugged. His belly tried to move along but gave up halfway. \"No problem. Go ahead. The party's the entire night.\" He gave a two-fingered salute. \"Catcha later, mister the twat.\" Dominic smiled and tried to make his way through the mass. It turned out to be slightly easier than he had expected, though he had to make a few detours when people truly refused to budge. On the way he encountered Gavin, who winked at him, and Felicity, who hugged him. She did seem as surprised about it as he was and the empty glass with blue residuals in her hand probably went a long way to explain it. Just before he slipped into the garden through the open garden windows he caught a glimpse of Carl, who was throwing all kinds of things into the air under cheering. The garden wasn't empty, but there were a lot less people than inside the house. Most of them were talking in small groups. On a large wooden reclining chair with cushions lay Quentin. He was dressed in a navy blue suit today with a red shirt and a handkerchief in the same colour peeping out of the breast pocket. On his nose rested brown shades. Dominic felt himself relax. He put the yellow cocktail on the garden table next to the chair. At the sound Quentin stirred. He smiled when he caught sight of him. \"Hullo, twat.\" He looked over the rim of his shades at the glass. \"Is that yours?\" Dominic rolled his eyes at the subtlety but kept smiling. \"You can have it. I don't really like cocktails.\" \"Ah. Thank you.\" As he reached for the glass, the older man shuffled his legs out of the way. \"Sit down, if you like.\" Dominic obligingly sat down on the reclining chair, his mood lifting already. The Ministry and all its troubles seemed far less important with the sun gently warming his dark suit and Quentin's legs pressed against his back. He rested his elbows on his knees and looked aside. \"This is a nice place.\" \"Mmh.\" Quentin took a sip. \"Yes, I quite like it myself as well. And when the shed's finished,\" he motioned to the back of the garden and Dominic's gaze followed. There was indeed an old barn, in the same brick as the main house, \"well, things can really get started.\" \"Finished?\" he could hear the puzzlement in his own voice. \"Yes.\" He didn't have to turn around: the glee was evident in the other man's voice. \"We're turning it into a studio.\" \"Studio?\" He turned back, frowning. Quentin looked like the proverbial cat who had gotten hold of the proverbial cream. \"Look at this.\" He was handed a sheet of paper from the garden table. He gave Quentin another questioning look, but the older man just nodded at the paper again. He bowed his head and read, immediately frowning. It was a schematic overview. Or not so much an overview as – as references to laws, opinions and cases, all connected with arrows, some accompanied by exclamation marks. He had told Quentin about some of these. And all together they formed – he felt his eyes widen as it all clicked in his head. \"A legal commercial radio station?\" \"Yes.\" The older man was still looking smug. \"Donne over there –\" he gestured to a small group in the garden, where a white-haired man was laughing uproariously, \"says it would work.\" \"Donne? Of Donne & King?\" Dominic couldn't keep the disbelief from his voice. \"The very one.\" Quentin fished an orange slice out of the glass. \"They're going to defend Radio Rock in court. So,\" he started nibbling on the fruit flesh, \"do you think it would work?\" Dominic looked back at the page. \"I never saw you note anything down.\" \"Ridiculously good memory. Once it's said out loud, I can easily remember stuff,\" was the flippant reply. \"I told you some of these. I told you most of these.\" He still had some difficulty wrapping his head around it. \"Of course you did. My dear boy, why else did you think I listened to you?\" He sounded amused and utterly unaware of the block of ice that had just dropped into Dominic's stomach. Unconsciously, the grip on the paper became white-knuckled. \"You had better change the name of the station.\" He listened to his own voice, which sounded cold and detached. \"That way, if Radio Rock gets convicted, the new station won't have to close down.\" \"Okay... Are you feeling alright?\" The frown was audible. \"You sound a bit weird.\" \"I'm fine, thank you,\" he replied stiffly, smoothing his outer jacket as he stood up. \"If you're sure.\" The suspicion hadn't completely disappeared from Quentin's voice yet. \"Would you like me to introduce you to someone? I've got some nieces around here. Or,\" he could feel the older man's eyes on him, pondering, \"I think there's even a nephew, if you like.\" Without conscious direction, his hands formed fists. \"No, thank you,\" he spat and to his horror heard his voice tremble. \"I am not partial to this kind of parties. I shall leave you to it.\" He made to go, but thin fingers wrapped themselves around his wrist. \"Dominic, what –\" He brusquely moved his hand backwards and easily broke the grip. Turning back to the reclining figure, he didn't bother to hide his anger. \"I've helped you all I can and you don't need me anymore. I'm leaving.\" Quentin made to get up and instinctively, he took a step back. \"I don't suppose we will see each other again.\" He forced his voice to sound calm. \"So goodbye.\" He turned on his heels and stalked away to his car. He wasn't running. This was a logical conclusion to a task, just like it had been in every other job he'd had. They had used his expertise and now they didn't need him anymore. It had been a stupid decision helping them in the first place, fuelled by a sense of justice, yes, but stupid nevertheless. The whole idea had been stupid. To think they might have liked him for his personality... he slammed his car door shut. Was stupid . His feet had automatically led him to the Underground Bar . He had only gone out because his own whiskey bottle had only lasted for a glass and he really, really needed another drink. Or two. He hesitated a moment at the threshold but then squared his shoulders. He was getting drunk and no overweight DJ would stop him. Besides, it was Thursday. With any luck, no members of Radio Rock would be present. Carl smiled in surprise as he made his way to the bar. \"Hey, haven't seen –\" \"A whiskey please,\" Dominic cut him off as he sat down on a bar seat. Carl frowned, but took out a glass. \"Okay.\" Dominic took it and downed it in one gulp. He sat the glass down and looked at Carl's dumbfounded expression. \"Another one.\" \"O-okay.\" The nervousness in the young man's voice would have amused him at any other time. He drank his second (or third, depending how you looked at it) slower, sipping and staring at himself in the mirror behind the bar. He looked awful. He had forgotten his coat, he was still in the suit he wore to work, tie half untied, and his hair was a mess because he had repeatedly dragged a hand through it in frustration. Strands of hair were falling into his eyes. Well, he supposed he looked like he needed another drink. His next whiskey came from another bartender, who had probably been called in because of how busy the place was getting. It meant Carl couldn't come over to try and talk to him, but he could feel the young man's worried glances from the other side of the bar. And yes, when he wanted to start on his next glass, Carl's hand landed on his arm. \"Don't you think you've had enough?\" He slowly looked up and glared forcibly, as he never allowed himself at the Ministry. Apparently it was more effective than he had assumed: Carl did not only remove his hand but actually took a step back. \"No,\" he said, enunciating the word slowly before he looked back at his drink. He heard the youngster stutter an apology before disappearing again and felt strangely satisfied. Apparently Carl had decided to call in help. Dominic was slowly swishing the last swallow in his glass, resting his forehead on his palm, when a large, meaty hand landed on his shoulder. \"Hello, mister the twat.\" He looked up into the mirror and saw the large form of Dave stand next to him. Behind him stood the Count, who winked when he saw him look. \"We heard you were trying to get criminally drunk,\" Dave continued conversationally as he hoisted himself on an empty bar seat. Dominic drank the last of the glass and motioned to the second bartender. \"Did you now?\" he said uninterestedly as the man poured him another drink. He had always heard that things got muddy if you drank too much, but to him everything seemed clearer, from the bartender's nervous smile to the smell of the Count's cigar. Dave conspiratorially leant forward. \"It's a girl, isn't it?\" Dominic slowly turned his head and tried the full glare again. To his glee, Dave blinked rapidly and leant away. \"No.\" He looked at the counter again. After a while the heavy DJ seemed to have gathered his courage again. \"Look, there's no shame in asking advice, mate. I'd be more than happy to share some tips with you. I have more than enough experience with the – ladies .\" Dominic didn't need to look up to know that Dave would be wriggling his eyebrows suggestively. \"You could call that taking advantage of the blind,\" Dominic muttered before taking another swallow. The Count guffawed. \"None of them were blind!\" Dave's indignation was nearly tangible. \"The mentally ill, then.\" The Count attempted to disguise his laughter as a cough, but failed miserably. \"Will you –!\" In the mirror, Dave made a visible try to keep his composure, but some of his irritation bled through in his voice. \"Twat is really only a euphemism in your case, isn't it?\" Dominic turned to face Dave and arched an eyebrow. \"Like fat is one in yours?\" Dave was now looking murderous, only force of will keeping him from hitting Dominic. The younger man looked at the other's clamped fist in interest. He had never been in a bar fight before. It might be an interesting experience and he was fairly certain he could goad the other man enough to get him to throw the first punch. He opened his mouth to do just that when a familiar voice next to him asked: \"What's going on?\" He whipped his head around. There stood Quentin, this time in a brown suit and a dark scarf, looking between the three of them. \"I've lost my job,\" he heard his mouth blurt out. As on command, his entire body sagged in the older man's direction. Quentin's only sign of surprise was a quick blink. \"You were fired?\" \"Not exactly, no,\" he replied tiredly. \"You quit?\" the Count suggested. He slowly shook his head, keeping his eyes on Quentin. \"I doubt Dormandy wanted to fire me when I was called to his office and I certainly didn't want to quit.\" Quentin kept looking expectantly, so he gave in to his desire to tell all. \"He started to shout and I shouted back.\" The last weeks his disdain for his superior had only grown with every temper tantrum the man had thrown when things didn't go his way. When he had managed to pin the guilt of some stupid little mistake on him again, something in Dominic had snapped. \"In the end, he said that if I left now, I didn't have to hope for a government job ever again and then I called him a childish, hypocritical wannabe dictator with a ridiculous moustache and slammed the door.\" He heard the Count whistle. \"I thought you didn't like your job?\" Dave raised his hands in surrender as he finally tore his eyes of Quentin and glared at him again. \"I love my job. Just not my boss,\" he replied coldly. \"Alright, jeez, just asking.\" He ignored Dave's muttering and raised his arm to down the last of the glass. A hand on his arm stopped him. He looked up at Quentin questioningly. \"I think we'd better get you home, don't you?\" the older man said in a gently tone. Dominic tried to think this over, but found that the promised muddiness of his thoughts had finally set in. In the end he just shrugged and got up, which revealed another unfortunate side-effect of drinking more than is wise. Luckily Quentin quickly threw an arm around his waist before he made contact with the floor. \"C'mon, let's get you –\" He didn't remember anything after that. He woke up in a moving car. His stomach gave a violent lurch and he grabbed the door lever blindly, rolling out of the car into what felt like grass. He managed to get on all fours before the contents of his stomach were violently expelled. Tears pricked into his eyes but he screwed them shut. His stomach kept churning dangerously. He had not heard the car stop, but felt someone kneel next to him. \"There, there, my dear boy,\" Quentin's voice soothed over his gulps of breath. A hand brushed his hair from his sweaty forehead. \"It'll be over soon. Considerate of you not to throw up in the car, by the way. Now, now. Just breathe. That's it.\" He didn't know how long they sat there, him heaving and eyes closed with Quentin's hand rubbing between his shoulder blades and a handkerchief that smelled of the older man's aftershave mopping his brow. Finally, the cloth slowly rubbed against his lips and Quentin's voice said: \"Now let's try and get you back into the car, eh?\" He slowly nodded, not trusting himself to speak. Quentin helped him up and slowly led him to the car, as he refused to open his eyes. He sat down in the car seat and promptly passed out again. He opened his eyes in a sundrenched bed, his mouth feeling fuzzy and dry, his head pounding. The light was unbearable . He crunched his eyes shut again and pressed his palms against his eyelids. The dark was a relief as he attempted to calm down. When he thought he would be able to handle the world, he slowly opened his eyes again. The pounding in his head intensified, but he did not feel the overwhelming need to crawl under the blankets once again. He looked down. Not blankets. A grass green duvet. He slowly looked around. He wasn't in his apartment, but in an unknown bedroom. The walls were a slightly softer green than the duvet and there was a large wooden wardrobe standing in one corner and a small desk with chair in the other. The bed frame was also wooden, with soft cushions and a firm mattress. There were two mahogany doors, one opposite the bed and one opposite the window. They had brass doorknobs. Dominic slowly got up, swinging his feet from under the duvet to the floor, which was also made of a dark wood and pleasantly warmed up from the sun. He looked at his toes and tried to remember when he had taken his socks and shoes off. Or his tie. Or his outer jacket, for that matter. He couldn't remember though. The last thing he remembered was a cool hand on his forehead and a murmuring, deep voice... Oh . He carefully got up and walked to the window with the complementary curtains and looked out. He knew that lawn and the barn at the end of it. Quentin hadn't driven him to his apartment. He had driven him to his house . Only logical, if one thought about it. After all, he had never told any of them his address. But it was a bit awkward . Especially since his storming off a few weeks ago and then getting drunk last night. Ah well. There was nothing for it then. Dominic turned again, took a deep breath and walked to the door opposite the bed. He let his hand rest hesitantly on the handle, his stomach churning, before firmly pushing it down. He blinked. Not exactly what he expected. Behind the door was a bathroom, in white and blue ceramic tiles and with another door. He looked a bit lost at the bath tub, thick white towels and the small sink and mirror opposite. There was a lonely toothbrush in a glass and a tube of toothpaste. The fuzzy feeling in his mouth intensified and he stumbled to the sink. He put some of the toothpaste on a finger and brushed his teeth to the best of his ability, rinsing a couple of times extra to chase the horrible feeling from his mouth. After that he raided the cupboards on each side of the mirror, steadfastly ignoring the mirror. In one of them he found aspirin and he gratefully swallowed two tablets dry before gulping down a few mouthfuls of water from the tab. His head still felt awful, but he nevertheless felt slightly better when he tried the second door. It lead to a second bedroom, the mirror image of the one he woke up in, but this one in blue tints and obviously lived in. Clothes were strewn all over the floor, the duvet was lying crumpled at the end of the bed, a cup was balancing on a large stack of paper in the middle of the floor and the doors of the wardrobe stood wide open. In it hung a collection of suits in every possible colour. Dominic closed the door and went back to the green room. He found his shoes next to the second door, but his other clothes were nowhere to be found. He shrugged to himself and immediately regretted doing so, as a pain flash immediately stabbed upwards into his brain. Holding his shoes firmly in one hand and his eyes slit shut as much as possible without actually closing them, he opened the second door. He ended up in a cream coloured corridor with three other doors, one of which probably lead to the blue room. On one end of the hall there was a large window, but the end closest to Dominic lead to stairs going downwards. There was the sound of music drifting up. He stumbled more than stepped down, ending up in the large living room where the Count had offered him a drink two weeks ago. The glass doors to the garden were closed, but the last of the October sun was lighting the room. Now all the people were gone, he could actually see the furniture and walls. The last were the same colour as the corridor upstairs, the comfortable looking couches and various cupboards in different sizes were all in soft blue and brown. On a small table a record player was playing. A voice in the kitchen hummed along. Dominic slowly walked towards it. Again, most of the room was cream coloured, with dark wooden cupboards and a large scrubbed table in the middle of the space. Quentin stood at the stove, his back to the door. He was in lilac today. The smell of eggs hung in the kitchen and Dominic felt his stomach move uncomfortably again. He swallowed the nausea down and rapped his knuckles against the doorpost. Quentin turned around and smiled broadly. \"Ah! Hello. Slept well? You'd better drink that, by the way,\" he continued, pointing with a spatula at a glass on the table, filled to the brim with a drab, brown liquid. Dominic made his way to the table, sinking into a chair. He dropped his shoes next to it. \"Some horrible hangover cure?\" he asked, slightly surprised at the gravelly sound of his own voice. \"Because I've already taken some of your aspirin.\" Quentin chuckled deeply as he turned back to the stove. \"That works better than aspirin, believe you me. Besides,\" he gestured once with the spatula at the wall, \"it'll give you a bit of an appetite. After a night of boozing, you need a good breakfast. Or lunch,\" he added, throwing a look to Dominic's left. He followed the older man's gaze and saw another door with a clock above it. He felt his mouth fall open. \"Good lord!\" It was one o'clock. He had never in his life slept this late. Then again, he had never gotten that drunk before. Quentin chuckled again, throwing him an amused look over his shoulder. \"Such surprise. Now c'mon, drink up.\" Dominic raised the tall glass, looking at the liquid in trepidation. Then he said, dread obvious in his voice, \"Well cheers,\" scrunched his eyes closed and took a deep gulp. He opened his eyes in surprise again. \"I thought hangover cures were supposed to taste bad .\" \"Oh, I always thought that to be stupid ,\" Quentin said vaguely, picking up what looked to be parsley from a small bowl next to the stove and sprinkling it over the pan. \"Like they're trying to tell you something.\" Dominic snorted and drank some more. True, it looked awful, but it tasted rather sweet, and – he took another swallow – like berries. Blueberries. And a hint of strawberry and mint as well. And – he noticed to his surprise he had finished the glass. He blinked and put the glass down. His stomach had calmed down and the eggs didn't seem to smell as horrible as before. Indeed, he thought as Quentin put a large pan on the table and handed him a fork, he might be able to even swallow a few mouthfuls of the omelette. Quentin had added what looked like every vegetable he had been able to think of, including some he didn't even recognize. On the side, a few straps of bacon sizzled happily. \"Now where's the bread?\" Quentin muttered, rummaging through cupboards. \"Ah – here it is.\" He took a long, strange looking bread to the table and tore it in two, handing Dominic one half. \"Bon appétit or something like that. Hope you don't mind eating out of the pan.\" \"Not at all,\" Dominic said quickly as the other man sat down and also lifted his fork. They shared the omelette. Dominic found to his surprise after a few bites he was actually hungry and after half the omelette he wolfed down the half bit of bread, which was called 'ciabatta' according to Quentin, and also another quarter of Quentin's, who had pushed it into his direction without a glance. When chewing his last bite, he suddenly caught Quentin's amused look. He immediately slowed down and swallowed while his cheeks were heating. \"I'm sorry, that was –\" \"Don't apologize,\" the older man interrupted, rolling his eyes. \"You were hungry. I've been in the same position.\" He stabbed the final bit of omelette. \"Now about last night –\" \"I'm sorry for that as well,\" he said hastily, \"I behaved abominably. I'll go back tonight and...\" he stopped, frowning. \"Did I pay?\" Quentin hummed while swallowing his bite. \"Sort of. You had passed out, but we got out your wallet, so you don't have to worry about that.\" He put down his fork and looked sternly at Dominic. \"And don't go apologizing to everybody. You were feeling miserable. The only thing fun about that is that you can make other people feel bad as well. And it probably did Dave good as well,\" he added, musing. \"His ego was getting bigger than his belly.\" Dominic felt himself redden, but Quentin continued, oblivious. \"Anyhow, I actually wanted to discuss your job offer.\" Dominic frowned in thought. \"My new job offer? I don't –\" Quentin raised a hand and he obediently fell silent. \"Donne called this morning, you see. The news of your resignation has spread incredibly quickly and he was hoping I might know where to find you. Apart from him, apparently four other companies are interested in you and he was quite desperate to be the first to contact you.\" Quentin folded his hands under his chin and smiled rather teasingly as Dominic felt the blush climb up all the way to his ears. He decided to stare at the pan instead. \"I had no idea you were that popular.\" \"I told you,\" he sputtered at the pan. \"I'm good at my job.\" \"Clearly,\" Quentin agreed. \"But seeing as Donne isn't here, perhaps you'd like to hear my offer first?\" His gaze snapped up. \" Your job offer?\" \"Mmh. I need a secretary,\" Quentin explained, stretching lazily. \"Being a legal radio station apparently means double the amount of paperwork,\" he sounded slightly irritated at that and Dominic couldn't help but smile. \"And I'm lazy,\" he admitted. \"I'd love some help.\" \"I – that's very kind of you, Quentin, but –\" he was silent for a moment. \"I really don't need charity,\" he said finally. Quentin now folded his arms, frowning. \"It's not charity. I really am lazy.\" Dominic guffawed at that and a small answering smile flitted over the other's face. \"Yes, yes. But I do mean it, Dominic,\" he sounded serious. \"I suppose I could easily get a secretary somewhere, but I'd like it to be you.\" \"Why?\" he frowned in puzzlement. Quentin stilled for a moment and then shrugged his half-shrug. \"I rather like you.\" Dominic felt the just-disappeared blush come up again. When he didn't reply, Quentin got up and started gathering the dishes, putting them into the sink. \"Oh, by the by, how much did you get paid?\" he asked conversationally. Slightly confused, Dominic named the amount. \"I'd pay you...\" Quentin halted a moment before opening the tab and named a - well, a frankly ridiculous figure. His mouth fell open. \"Quentin... Have you any idea how much money that is?\" The older man quickly rinsed the pan and put it to the side. \"Yes, it's the double, isn't it?\" He closed the tab again, muttering, \"Oh, I'll do the rest later,\" and turned back to Dominic. \"Is it too little?\" \"Too much, more likely,\" he replied feebly. \"Oh.\" Quentin chewed his lower lip for a moment and then gave another half-shrug. \"Well, I could pay you less, if you prefer. I don't really know what secretaries earn these days.\" \"Er... Thank you.\" Dominic looked down and scratched his hair. \"I'll – I'll think about it.\" \"Good.\" Quentin's smile was audible in his voice. \"Now,\" he clapped his hands. \"Would you like to see the studio?\" Before they left, Quentin made them each a mug of tea. They stood in companionable silence until the water boiled. Dominic also borrowed a pair of socks, as the other man explained he had washed whatever clothes of his were \"dirty or drenched with sweat.\" It had seemed him better not to inquire any further. After that, Dominic followed the older man as they marched across the lawn to the barn. \"This was originally meant as a bed and breakfast,\" he called over his shoulder as Dominic tried to keep up and not to spill any tea. \"I bought it before any guests got in. Turns out it's too remote to actually work.\" \"Where did you get the money?\" Dominic inquired. Even without profit, these old farmhouses did not come cheap. \"Hmm? Oh, I sold my old place.\" Quentin sounded quite disinterested. \"And I own some houses up in the north, so I got the rent coming in every month.\" \"I see,\" was all he knew to reply. He had suspected Quentin to have money, but there was still a difference between having money and being rich. \"Here we are then.\" Quentin pushed the (obviously newly installed) oaken door open. \"What do you think?\" Dominic slowly stepped inside. It was huge , was his first thought. The entire space had to be the same surface area as the entire farmhouse itself. Most of it was covered in large troughs, only they were filled with records instead of feed. Another quarter of the space was occupied by two glass cubicles, each with what looked like a chair and desk, plus a collection of head phones, microphones and record players. The light was coming in from large windows in each side. \"It's – It's very impressive,\" he said honestly. \"Are all studios this large?\" Behind him, Quentin chuckled. \"No, no, not at all. Even on the boat we didn't have this much space. But I thought, y'know,\" he didn't even have to turn to know Quentin would half-shrug, \"why not? I've got this anyhow.\" \"And all those records?\" \"Had to rebuy most of them,\" Quentin grumbled and nearly unconsciously, Dominic smiled. \"They went under with the ship. Including some very precious first recordings, I might add.\" There was a sigh. \"But enough of that. Would you like to see my office?\" \"Yes, please.\" He turned, but the older man simply slipped past him. \"Great, follow me.\" He moved in the direction of a small staircase Dominic hadn't noticed before, to his right. The wood creaked under their feet. When he reached the top, Dominic instinctively held his breath. The large windows downstairs simply went on in this room and above his head the roof began to slant sideways. Everything was made of wood: the floor, the roof, the walls, the giant desk standing before the left wall... There was a small table surrounded by blue seats and one canapé on a small blue rug to the wall closest to his right. Above it hung a magnificent painting. \"Is that...\" his voice trailed off, captivated by the colour play on the painting. \"A Monet? Yes.\" Quentin's deep voice came from behind him. \"The only thing I kept from the old house. And I hardly could hang it in the main house, somebody might spill on it.\" Dominic tore his gaze from the painting to turn around. Quentin had seated himself behind the giant desk. \"It's beautiful,\" he managed to say. \"Ah. Yes.\" For the first time since they met, Quentin actually seemed uncomfortable. \"I quite agree. Of course,\" he continued, sounding slightly more self-assured, \"if you'd agree to work here, we'd get you another desk. And a filing cabinet.\" He looked searchingly at him above his tea cup. \"You do like filing cabinets, don't you?\" He couldn't help but laugh. \"Yes. Yes, I do.\" Again, Quentin looked rather smug. \"I rather thought so.\" Still smiling, Dominic walked to one of the large windows and looked back to the farmhouse. He sipped his now lukewarm tea. \"Oh, and the green room is yours,\" Quentin added offhandedly. He whirled around. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"The green room.\" Quentin waved into the direction of the main house. \"Consider it yours. Felicity has already demanded the yellow one and I'll keep the purple one for people who really aren't fit for driving anymore, but the green room is yours. Please.\" His voice sounded more firm as he caught sight of Dominic's expression. \"It'll be lowering the chance to wake up to Dave's snoring.\" Dominic turned back to the main house. He rubbed a hand over his mouth, shaking his head and laughing at the same time, trying to ignore the voice that said this house felt much, much more like home than the apartment he had lived in for the last ten years. It was a stupid idea, not responsible, not thought-through, not like him at all. But then again, he was getting quite experienced in the stupid-idea area. \"Oh hell,\" he finally said, still laughing. \"Alright, I'll do it. I'll be your secretary.\" He turned around again and noticed he had apparently surprised Quentin, who was looking at him astounded. \"Are you certain? Don't you, y'know, have to think about it for another week?\" He sounded outright disbelieving. \"I probably should, yes,\" he smiled. \"Shall we draw up the contract?\" Quentin studied him for another second and then a grin broke through. \"Why don't you sit down, my dear.\" Drawing up the contract didn't take too long: it turned out that, under two publicity agreements, a couple of contracts (Harold's, Felicity's and Gavin's), a bill for a hand-weaved scarf and a hat, Quentin actually had put a couple of generic contracts, which they adapted for Dominic. He managed to get his pay down to three-quarters of the original number, which was still more than he had expected to earn ever . When he had to sign however, he hesitated. Quentin, of course, noticed. \"If you have second doubts –\" \"I don't,\" he interrupted. \"It's just...\" he took a deep breath, \"oh well. You're going to laugh,\" he warned and signed. Quentin took the document with raised eyebrows and looked down. His eyebrows climbed even higher. \"Oh. I was being prophetical when we first spoke.\" Dominic blew out a breath. \"Pretty much, yes.\" \"Mmm.\" Quentin signed as well. \"Well, if you don't tell...\" with a flourish he turned the page around again, so he could read the second autograph, \"I won't tell.\" Dominic looked at the autograph and stopped. And looked again. \"You're the –\" \"I don't like the official title,\" Quentin quickly intervened with a wince. \"So the old house...\" \"Is more of an estate, yes.\" \"And those 'some houses' are...\" \"More like a complete village.\" Quentin sounded rather wary. \"Please don't remind me of it.\" Dominic snorted and leant back. \"Alright.\" The days to the start of the new radio station sailed by. There was paperwork (lots of it), meetings with potential sponsors (even more) and cleaning up after Quentin (most of all). Nevertheless, Dominic doubted he had ever been this happy. He didn't mind doing most of the work – in fact, when Quentin tried to help, things went slower than ever. He enjoyed organizing and reorganizing while Quentin talked to high-ups in firms, most of which he had gone to school with at one point or another. The meetings were, well, fun . He would do most of the negotiations, looking sharp and polished, while Quentin lounged in the next chair. And if things got difficult, the older man would drop a little fact which usually had the effect of a bombshell and clinched the discussions into their favour. He thoroughly enjoyed the expression on their faces when they all of a sudden realised the sleepy, reclining man was laying bare all their weak points, that Quentin was smart, could probably run rounds around their brains and had a truly wonderful memory. He never could stop grinning after one of those assemblies, which would make Quentin smile in turn. He had hardly been back to his apartment since it all started, only now and then to change clothes. There were almost always things to do at the farmhouse and there nearly always were people belonging to Radio Rock. It felt more, well, like home . \"Mister the twat. I have a preposition.\" \"Hmm?\" He looked up from the file Donne & King had sent them with details about the court case. \"What did you say, Dave?\" \"Would you like to earn fifty pounds?\" The kitchen table fell silent. It had just been a rather busy afternoon and there were plenty of people. Apart from Dave, Simon, the Count, Angus, Marianne and Carl were having tea. Everybody had stopped drinking, looking between Dave and him apart from Felicity, who had just stooped down to get some cookies and had frozen with her hand half in the oven. Dominic blinked. \"In return for?\" \"Four eggs cracked on your head.\" Dave had his arms folded above his belly and he was smiling reassuringly. \"But a moment discomfort.\" It was like a tennis match, he thought to himself as everybody's eyes flitted from him to Dave. Apparently they actually expected him to agree. \"Thank you, but no,\" he said clearly, bowing back over the file. \"A hundred pounds.\" The tension went up a notch higher. Angus gave a squeak but a look from the Count silenced him. Dominic guffawed but shook his head. \"Honestly, no.\" When Dave opened his mouth again, he added: \"Not for any money.\" For a moment there was silence again and he actually thought he might be able to continue reading now he had done their little test, but before he could start again a cacophony of sound broke loose. Simon jumped up, lifted his arms into the air and started shouting: \"He did it! He actually fucking did it!\" Angus turned to Dave, voice high and complaining that all he had ever been offered were ten pounds. Dave was telling him to shut up rather loudly. The Count started pounding Dominic on his back as if he had won a marathon, shaking his head and grinning wildly. Marianne was laughing loudly and Felicity had finally managed to get her cookies out of the oven and was now depositing shakily at least ten of them next to his mug. Carl just leant forward with a smile and asked: \"How did you know?\" \"What, that it wouldn't be fair?\" Dominic asked back when the rumour had quieted down a bit. Carl nodded and he shrugged in reply. \"There's always a catch,\" he said simply. When none of them reacted he looked around. \"Have none of you been to public school?\" Most of them shook their heads, but Carl hesitatingly said: \"Yes.\" Dominic looked him up and down and then smiled a bit bitterly. \"But your parents had money.\" \"Yes,\" Carl admitted. \"Or well, my mother did. And she knew the headmaster.\" He shrugged again. \"There you are. I got in via a scholarship. They tried that kind of thing on me all the time.\" \"What, always the three-egg deal?\" Simon asked. Dominic blinked and looked at him. \"Is that what you call it? No, not that,\" he shook his head. \"But always games that, if you participated, would end up with you embarrassed and with no money.\" He bowed back over the file. \"Besides, it's always better to be poor and dignified than dirty and rich.\" He shrugged again. \"Or that's what I was taught.\" There was quiet again. He refound his sentence and had just started reading it again when Angus added: \"Or at least, when the rich part is depending on Dave.\" \"True,\" Dave conceded. \"I've been broke since Monday.\" They had somehow managed to figure out it was his birthday. Felicity had made a large cake, Bob was the only one who was allowed to touch the recorder (and he played nothing but Ella Fitzgerald) and they refused to let him into the barn to work. Quentin had bought him yet another filing cabinet (his third), but all ideas to explain he really didn't need another one disappeared when he saw the older man beaming proudly. So instead he just thanked him earnestly as the Count and Gavin guffawed behind Quentin's back. In the evening, they unanimously decided it wasn't possible for him to dislike all cocktails and Carl started working. By twelve o'clock, the coffee table, floor and various cupboards were filled up with empty glasses (as after Dominic's sip to taste there was always somebody willing to empty the rest of it) and there were five cocktails Dominic had admitted to not tasting awful. Finally a bright red glass was plucked out of his hand as Dave worriedly said: \"Stop it Carl, he gets nasty when he's drunk.\" Dominic looked at his empty hand in wonder for a moment, then shrugged. Things might actually get to be alright , he thought sleepily before falling asleep on Quentin's shoulder. The message spread out through Britain. There were posters, true, hung up all over the country, but most people heard the news from other people. It was whispered at work, discussed at the pub and gossiped about when standing in line in the supermarket. And at December the 9th, at a quarter to seven, people all through Britain gathered around whichever radio was close by. Families gathered round the only one in the house; teenagers all tried to fit in one bed as the static crackled; in a home for the elderly one of the nurses had put the radio in the middle of the room as the occupants of the home all stared at it; in the back of a factory a man put on the speaker normally reserved to call out emergencies and put it next to the appliance; in a couple of streets, there was one radio standing in the middle of the road with a megaphone next to it and all the neighbours had gathered around it with garden chairs and blankets; a couple of strict looking men (one of them sporting a ridiculous moustache) in an office, all looking rather hostile at the machine, shuffled a bit closer; a young girl called Jemima who lived in a mansion, carefully lifted a radio from under her pillow and slowly turned it on; and in a comfy living room, two women were speaking while a man searched for the right airwave. \"He said he was alright when I last saw him,\" the mousy-looking one with glasses said. \"And he did look... happy.\" \"Then why are you worried?\" the other, more firmly built, asked. Her friend stopped rubbing her hands. \"I suppose... because I've never seen him happy before. And his hair was loose. He never had his hair loose.\" The firmly built one laughed. \"He did look rather uptight when we met him. Do you miss him, Doris?\" she continued softly. Doris snorted. \"Oh god, not like that. It was never like that.\" She giggled. \"Good heavens, no . It's more like...\" she paused. \"You know, people who've lived through a war? I know it sounds dramatic, but –\" \"To hear you talk about that boss of yours, I wouldn't say so,\" the man called as he got up from his knees. \"It should be alright. Seven, wasn't it?\" \"Yes, it was seven,\" the woman who wasn't Doris agreed. They all turned to the standing clock expectantly, watching the minute hand shuffle closer to its goal. Any minute now... At exactly seven o'clock, a deep voice broke through the speakers. \"Test, test... Is it working?\" the voice was silent for a moment and then continued: \"Apparently it is. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this brand new radio station, called The Boat. We will broadcast 24/7, with only pop and rock 'n' roll. Any resemblance to a pre-existing radio station is, of course, complete coincidence.\" There were some enthusiastic roars and whistles in the background. \"And as you can no doubt hear,\" the voice added drily, \"the entire team that made this radio station possible, is standing next to me. Let me introduce them to you. First the DJs: the Count!\" There was a whole lot of applause and whistling coming from the speakers. \"Gavin Cavanagh!\" Again more noise from the speakers. \"Doctor Dave!\" Noise. \"Simon Swafford! 'Motormouth' Midnight Mark! 'The DawnTreader' Bob Silver!\" After every name there was a storm of applause and roars from the radio. \"And last but not least: Angus 'The Nut' Nutsford!\" There was the sound of one person clapping. Then there was silence, until high voice broke through. \"Not funny, guys!\" There was an explosion of laughter on every side of the radio and even the introducing voice chuckled along. \"No, that wasn't too nice. Anyway, these musical maestros will now and then be interrupted by our own 'News' John Mayford.\" The applause continued. \"There is also a backup crew, ready to take care of these diligent workers. Harold and Thick Kevin will be looking after the technical aspects.\" The crowd on the other end kept cheering diligently. \"Felicity, the resident lesbian, will be taking care of any kitchen demands,\" more applause and someone called \"Wonderwoman!\" from what sounded the other end of the room, \"helped by Young Carl, who will make the most heavenly cocktails man has ever encountered.\" This time whistles ruled. \"He will not make these for broadcasting DJs, of course, and never for Simon.\" \"Oh c'mon, why not?!\" a voice from far away asked. \"Do we need to remind you of what happened last time?\" A sultry, Welsh voice questioned. A girl in Manchester, surrounded by her friends, fainted. \"That was once! Just once!\" \"Which only leaves,\" the deep voice continued over the still audible arguing, \"the ones who actually make sure this station keeps running by doing the boring paperwork, namely my secretary, Dominic 'the' Twatt and myself, Quentin.\" In a small living room, two women and a man stared at each other open-mouthed; miles away, a girl called Jemima had quickly placed both hands over her mouth so her laughter wouldn't be audible; and from an office with hostile-looking men, there was suddenly heard the loud cry \"ARSE!\" The voice from the radio went on, oblivious. \"Thank you very much. I will now leave you into the capable hands of the Count.\" \"Thank you, Quentin,\" a voice with a clear American accent continued. \"Yes, dear listeners, as you just heard, the little crew on 'The Boat' has grown slightly. Both Young Carl – whose drinks are really sent from heaven, I guarantee it – and Dominic or 'the twat', as he is better known, are both already indispensible.\" \"The twat is a converted man by the way,\" the high voice of Angus broke through. \"From Beethoven to The Seekers, people.\" \"Angus, will you –\" \"I am not!\" The new voice was clearly close and had an impeccable English accent. The three people in the small living room were now grinning widely. Somewhere else a man with a moustache grinded his teeth audibly. \"What?\" \"He said he's not converted,\" the Count repeated. \"And I can honestly get that. 'The Seekers', my ass...\" \"WHAT?!\" \"Oh, do stop screaming, Angus,\" the civilised voice snapped back. \"I got enough of that at the Ministry.\" \"Now, now,\" the deep voice that had done the introductions soothed as the Count laughed. Somewhere else in the country, six men who had been looking hostile now looked taken aback at a broken radio in a corner of the office while a seventh man stalked out. \"Why don't we all leave the Count to it, eh? C'mon, let's get to the kitchen.\" \"I've still got some cookies left, if you like, Angus,\" a woman's voice offered. \"I don't want no fucking cookies!\" a disappearing voice snapped back. \"Now that's all done and we're all alone again,\" the Count chuckled back, while a last vague, high-pitched \"What kind of cookies?\" drifted from the speakers, \"I'd like you not to be alone. We've been all alone for far too long, folks, and this airwave has been far too quiet. A bit later in the evening, I will gladly take you along to the new Beatles, The Magical Mystery Tour , and the new Rolling Stones' masterpiece, Their Satanic Majesties Request . But first, I'm dedicating this song to some special people. You all know who you are.\" The start of a song was softly slipping from the speakers. \"Now get out there, people. It's a chance for folks to meet, these ladies say, and I'd like y'all to do just that. Pick up that radio and get out there. You can dance yourself warm and you might just meet someone. They didn't get us down, so don't you get down. Go on, it's out there.\" The voice was replaced by music which grew in volume. In streets all through Britain people streamed out of their houses, radio in hand, and started dancing. A whole group of teenagers all took each other's hands and danced down the stairs to the front door. In a mansion, a young woman quickly put on some trousers, took the radio and slipped out of the house before starting to run in the direction of the nearest town. She was laughing and crying at the same time. And a small living room miles away, was empty. Three friends had taken the radio and each other's hands and had started dancing. A/N: songs used in this fic: - Dancing in the Streets from the album Dance Party by Martha and the Vandellas (1964). - Flying Home from the release Lullabies of Birdland , originally written by Lionel Hampton and others and sung by Ella Fitzgerald (1945). - Dream a Little Dream of Me written by Fabian Andre and others and sung by Ella Fitzgerald. I have not been able to trace the album, but the song should have been recorded about the '50s. The title is a reference to the Stevie Wonder hit Uptight (Everything's Alright) from 1964. I have shamelessly changed the meaning of the word uptight to refer to Dominic Twatt's behaviour. If I have made any mistake in my references or my depiction of the times, please forgive me. I was born in the 90s and the only thing my father would tell me, was that I definitely didn't want to know what he or my grandparents were up to in those crazy times, as I would probably die of shame. Finally, this story is my love letter to Bill Nighy and his languid grace. I regret nothing.

Then I left it for a few months and this morning I thought, well, if you don't, no-one else will. It is, therefore, not brilliant. Feel free to write a better one if you think you can, I'd applaud you. Anyway enjoy... -for you Elenore Swafford sat forlornly in the park, watching the shadows of the trees blowing in the wind. Her little toddler wandered about, chasing pigeons and pulling up grass. She watched him, outwardly attentive but really not paying him any attention at all. A shock of blond hair peeked out from under his bright green beanie, belying the father who neither knew of nor cared about him. It had been two and a half years since she'd left Radio Rock in disgrace and disappointment. It had never occurred to her that her 'bright idea' would not have appeared so bright to everyone else. That was the biggest problem, she supposed; the idea that had seemed so brilliant at the time had not gone nearly as planned. Gavin had said that it was a 'mad idea'. In hindsight she thought that might have been meant to discourage her. They'd met in a pub, and she'd been so drunk already that she didn't realize until she woke up beside him how gorgeous he really was. Before that second day was out she would have done anything for him; he'd made her feel so special, unique. He'd wanted her, and she'd wanted him more than anyone else she'd ever met. She already felt they were soulmates, and he'd said he thought so too. It had seemed so perfect, a fairytale she'd seen on the picture screen at the movies. She knew he was a DJ, a pirate, a hooligan; but she'd thought that in time, her own womanly influence could tame the parts of him that she didn't find more sexy than she'd ever found any man before. So when he said they couldn't be together, she'd disbelieved that, too. Of course they could be together if they both wanted it enough. And she'd wanted it more than anything in the whole world. And there was a way. She knew it could be done the minute she saw Simon Swafford sitting by himself in that same pub a week later, where she'd gone every night since Gavin had left to drown her sorrows. Simon was sweet and funny, but he didn't look like much and under normal circumstances she knew she'd never have given him a second glance. She felt bad about that now, bad about everything about Simon. She wondered sometimes, when she was alone at night while her baby woke up and cried, whether she hadn't made the wrong decision. She'd known it hadn't been the right one as the tears slipped from her eyes on the boat-ride back. How could it have gone so wrong? She'd had her whole future planned out in front of her, a life with Gavin, married to some guy she'd never need to remember the name of, surrounded in bliss and wild pop music. She tried to blame Gavin, but never believed it. He hadn't asked her to marry Simon; that had been her idea. She tried to blame Simon, but only for a heartbeat. He had no idea; he'd loved her, properly, and been prepared to marry her to prove it. Really, when she thought about it in the most blatant form of honesty and self-appraisal, she had no-one to blame but herself. She didn't even try to tell herself she hadn't always been like that; she knew that even before she'd met Gavin she'd been vapid as a summer butterfly. And still, she saw her life now as Gavin's fault. His fault for not caring; the 'obvious reasons' for which he would not marry her were insignificant, really. Simon had showed her that. Which was why, when her baby was born a boy nine months later with a tuft of dirty-blonde hair on his tiny head, she decided to call it Simon. In memory of a man who loved her, and whose heart she had broken; and in doing so, had broken her own.

Anyway. Why Dominic Twatt loves classical music. Disclaimer: I do not own \"The Boat that Rocked\", or any of the characters, I only own Iris and the briefly mentioned janitor. I also do not own Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. London. A great city, perfect for a great country. A city booming and strong, the pride of her country, and the people who occupy her. Who wouldn't be proud to live in a place where Big Ben's great, ringing dongs could be heard for miles around the city, where the Thames flowed about, powerful and dignified, where the countrie's goverment was practically a powerhouse? Dominic Twatt was no exception. Tall, slender and handsom, with a suit that could please anyone, and a reputation to make any goverment official happy, Twatt felt like royalty. However, though proud and admitting to himself all of the things of his great city and country, he knew also that the powerful place could be a depressing, grueling place to work as well. Who wouldn't think it depressing and grueling if they had to work for Sir Alistair Dormandy? Dormandy, an older \"gentleman\", shortish, also with a suit to impress, thick framed glasses, and beedy, arrogant eyes, with an attitude to match. Yes, the small man was a bundle of...well, for lack of a better word in Twatt's mind, atrociousness. What was that saying..? Oh, yes! \"Dynamite comes in small packages.\" Twatt just had to nod his head in agreement at this, smiling on the inside though physically he winced as the train screeched to a halt at its first stop. He straightned himself up again with a grunt, readjusting the holds he had on the standing pole and brief case, mulling over the day's events while someone to his left coughed. He was to shut down the Radio Rock , the most popular, powerful, and(in his oppinion), inappropriate pirate radio station in English waters. Not that the music was inappropriate, so much, but the djs' themselves. His oppinion didn't matter, however; his job was to shut down Radio Rock , and all other manner of pirate radio, not ponder on how moral or immoral the djs' were. Twatt checked his pocket watch(a watched that had been given to him by a very stuck-up family member) as the train came yet again to another screeching halt, yet again throwing him off blanace(this time nearly to the floor, since he'd released the pole to check his watch), as another grunt of annoyance passed his lips while he waited for the doors to open. Never again, he decided, wiping his hand off with a handkerchief as he left the train, would he ever ride one of those wretched vehicles. A simple quirk of the brows was the only sign of acknowledgement he showed the snowflakes and his visible breath while he left the Underground , now treading through the snow slush on the side walks. \"Radio Rock. Have you ever listened to them, Twatt?\" \"A bit, sir, not much. I'm more a Classical fan.\" he'd answered with a smile. \"Indeed.\" he said to himself, whistling Beethoven's Fifth down the lonely sidewalk. \"Good man!\" Dormandy cooed. \"By the end of the year, I want to effectively rid our currently great nation, and her waters, of the filth called \"pirate rock\". I don't care what we have to do to do it, just get ride of them. Now then, off to work!\" He was on the steps of the...rather plain-looking building of floor-upon floor of flats(some of the nicest, most expensive flats in London, he thought with a smile), brushing the snowflakes from his brouad shoulders, before pressing one of the buttons on the speaker. \"Who is it?\" \"It's me...I forgot my key was on my car keys...which you were in posession of this morning.\" he smiled. From above his head, a shrill buzzer sounded, telling him in its annoying scream that the door was unlocked. He passed through it quietly, his feet dragging as he made his way to the elevator. \"Sorry, Mr. Twatt.\" A janitor said from behind him, pausing his sweeping. \"The elevators are out of order this evening for repairs.\" Twatt's hand fell limply from its poised position in front of the \"up\" button to his side. \"You're joking.\" The janitor shook his head, giving the obviously tired man a sympathetic smile. \"Sorry, sir, I'm afraid not. The stairs are available, however.\" He was tripping over his own feet by the time he reached the sixth floor, swearing lightly under his breath, though he knew it wasn't gentlemanly in the least. But the gentleman's feet were sore, the gentleman was tired, the gentleman's hair was falling down in his eyes because his gel had worn out by the end of the day, and he worked for(who liked to humor himself with calling), the son of the devil. That being said, the gentleman didn't give a damn of if he was acting like a gentlman or not. Finally he was able to open the door to his flat, and-...Hold on. Why was the door to his flat unlocked? he'd locked it this morning when he'd left for work; he thought he had, anyway. Twatt rushed the door open, storming the flat in a short fit of panic, only hear Moonlight Sonata floating calmly on the unusually warm air of the flat. A woman, short, petite and brunette, gasped from her position in front of the stove as she whirled around to face him, her blue eyes wide and startled. The man and woman stared at each other, silently, the only sounds being the music and their panicked breaths. \"Dominic,\" The woman scolded, \"What's gotten into you? Rushing in here like that...\" Despite her grumbling, she walked to him, helping him remove his trench coat and suit jacket after he set his brief case down. \"The door was unlocked; you never leave it unlocked; I was worried about you...I thought someone may have broken in.\" he murmured, numbly allowing her to take his things. He was still bewitched by her, by how she wore nothing but a silky white nightgown, only partially covered by her open, bright red robe. \"Nope, I'm fine, obviously. I stepped out to take a few things to Pattie.\" Twatt allowed his eyes to widen. \"You went out...like that?\" \"It was just across the hallway, Dom. Now then,\" she smiled, standing up on her toes to peck his cheek, \"Are you hungry?\" Twatt smiled lightly, loving how his wife always knew what was affecting him...other than the obvious bewitching, which she had indeed taken note of with a smirk. \"Indeed.\" I didn't have any lunch today.\" Mrs. Dominic Twatt \"awed\" as she closed the door, setting the brief case by it. \"Nothing?\" Turning around again, she found her husband sitting at the kitchen bar, loosening his tie as he stared at her. \"That's not healthy, Dom.\" \"I didn't have time; Dormandy gave me a lot of work today.\" \"Hmph. I don't like Dormandy. You do know I don't like him, right?\" she asked her husband with a cocked brow, walking to him. \"Mhm.\" he smiled, placing his hands on his wife's hips, pulling her gently between his legs, while leaning back tiredly in the bar-chair. \"You've told me...several times.\" Then, furrowing his brows, \"Iris...why are you listening to Moonlight Sonata ?\" \"I...like it.\" she answered, her tone sounding as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. \"Why, darling?\" Twatt shook his head, arching his eyebrows. \"You usually don't listen to it unless you're in a bad mood.\" \"Or a relaxed one. It keeps me calm when I cook.\" Again, Twatt quirked his brows. \"Why specifically when you're cooking?\" Iris smiled sheepishly, stroking her husband's hair out of his eyes. \"I get angry with things when they don't cook right.\" Twatt snorted, wrapping his arms securely around his wife's waist. \"When do we eat?\" \"Half and hour.\" she answered casually, still stroking his hair. \"The oven isn't heating up as quickly as usual. So in the mean time...\" Iris slipped away from her husband's grasp, a tiny fit of giggles bursting past her lips as she danced into the living room, flitting quickly from Twatt's sight. Twatt, both intrigued and amused, followed. He found her bent over a wooden box full of records, her fingers shuffling through them like her life depended on it. \"Darling..?\" he called. \"Just a moment!\" she giggled in a sing-song voice. Apparently she found the record she'd been looking for, for she sprang up with one and replaced the Moonlight Sonata record with it. Iris stood straight, then, eye-balling her husband with a simple smile as a slow, calm waltz began to play, before holding her hand out. \"Care to dance?\" she murmured, her eyes gleaming. Twatt cocked his head to the side, pulling his brows close together. \"Darling...I'm very tired.\" \"If you're not too tired to eat,\" she smiled, placing herself in front of him, \"Then you're not too tired to dance.\" Twatt's shoulders fell. \"Darling...\" he whined. Iris lifted his left hand with her right, fitting it easily in his palm, while she stroked his chest with her left. \"But Dom...\" she wimpered, \"We haven't really spent any time together, Dom...I'd really like to dance with you.\" Twatt sighed. How could he resist her pleading eyes, crush the hope in them, and ignore the seduction in her voice? He couldn't. He simply couldn't ignore his wife...not today. \"Okay,\" he sighed again, smiling, \"I'll dance with you.\" Mrs. Twatt giggled, jerking her husband into a waltz, taking the lead without asking. Twatt, unable to ignore his wife's spirits, offered his own soft fit of laughter as he pulled his wife closer, dipping his head down so that their foreheads touched. \"Really, Iris, what's gotten into you?\" Iris breathed in through her mouth, grinning as she rubbed her nose against his. \"Can a woman not enjoy the presence of her husband?\" \"Yes, she can, but,\" he chuckled, cradling the back of her head in his right hand, \"You're acting nutty!\" \"Come now,\" she whispered, pressing a lingering kiss to his lips, \"You know I act nutty when I'm excited.\" \"Mmm.\" he nodded. \"Okay.\" Iris smirked; she had her husband right where she wanted him. She leaned up again, capturing his lower lip, pressing her body against the length of him while snaking her arms around his neck. \"Iris,\" Twatt murmured after a moment, not bothering to open his eyes. \"I have a lot of work tonight. I know what you're trying to do, and I appreciate i-\" Iris didn't allow him to continue, knowing if she didn't press on, she'd lose him for tonight to his work. She delved her fingers through his hair, kissing him harder, rougher, sliding her tongue between his teeth. \"Iris,\" he panted, \"I really must-\" Iris only repeated her gestures, using more force while, at the same time, the waltz grew louder, slightly faster, adding to the mood, making Twatt lower his guard as he felt the notes surround them, push them closer and harder as Iris forced her husband to listen. \"Iris,\" he murmured, cradling her face, \"Why is it so warm in here?\" \"The oven finally warmed up...faster than I thought it would, actually.\" she whispered. \"Iris?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Turn the oven off...we don't want a fire to break out while we dance.\" Dinner was long forgotten, sitting in the stove like a distant memory. The record on the record player had long ago played out, now sounding like static since the needle was no longer touching it. The only sounds in the master bedroom were that of a breeze floating freely through an open window, the slight rustling of sheets, and easy breathing. Twatt shifted again, allowing his hand to fall lightly on the side of his wife's face, touching his forehead to hers. \"Thank you.\" Iris smiled, inching closer to cuddle as she pulled the sheets to her shoudlers. \"Not a problem...I love you.\" Twatt smiled. \"I love you too, but...that was completely random, if I may say so.\" A soft chuckle passed Iris's lips as she placed her hand over her husband's. \"No, I agree. But you liked it, right?\" He coughed, stroking her cheek with his thumb. \"Of course! Yes, yes, I did. I was just wondering...\" \"What brought this on?\" He coughed again, nodding. \"The music. I listened to several different albums of classical music, and it made me think of you.\" Twatt's eye brows arched. \"Really?\" \"Mhm.\" she nodded. Oh, he couldn't help himself. He rolled over on to his back, grinning up at ceiling as his wife pressed herself against his side. \"I always knew there was a reason I was a fan of classical music.\" Well, there you have it! Why Twatt(in my imagination)loves classical music. Hopefully it wasn't corny, and hopefully it wasn't a waste of time writing this. I know it's a one-shot, but please review, even if it's just constructive criticism; I'll appreciate what you have to say. Thank you!

This is a story I started writing some time ago when I was on my Pirate Radio kick, but I rediscovered it the other day and revamped it a little. It's a bit of a Mary Sue, to be honest, but I'm pretty proud of it. No pairings except the beginning of OC/Simon (which will intensify in later chapters). So open your minds, put on a good Stones record and jump into the fog with me . Chapter 1 – Times Are A' Changin The rain outside pours steadily from the night sky, leaving streaks of raindrops on the car's window. I gaze out of the passenger seat drearily, clutching a folded up picture of my mother and I in my hand. It's all I have left of her now. I stare at the tall, dark-haired woman in the photograph whose hand rests on the shoulder of my 9-year-old self. I remember taking the photo; it's one of the few good memories of the old days, before she married my step-father. I was very camera shy then. It'd taken almost an hour just to convince me to smile. Now a small grin crosses my face easily at the memory. \"Amy, I'm talking to you. Are you even listening?\" Owen is in his usual happy mood. It's funny; I thought he'd be a little more excited at the prospect of me going away for a good long while. \"Not really.\" I say non-chalantly. He gives me a quick glare and then focuses on the road again. I never understood why my mother married him. She literally could have had any guy she wanted; she was beautiful. But of all the guys in the world, out of all the guys in England, she chose Owen Adams. Stiff, boring, stick-up-his-ass, balding, selfish, I'm-smarter-than-you, Owen Adams. I don't think the asshole ever really cared about me. I was more of an obligation because I always came first to mom. I think that's what got me through the past few years; just knowing that I was more important to her than he ever was. I also think this made Owen somewhat angry which never fails to amuse me. \"If it was up to me you'd never go anywhere near that scumbag.\" Owen continues. The \"Scumbag\" he was referring to was my father. Don't ask me why he's a scumbag, I have no idea. I've never met the man in my 18 years of existence. The only thing I have been told about him is that his name is Quentin and he lives on a boat. This, frankly, worries me a bit. My poor mom wasn't exactly all there in her last few days and I'm wondering if she's sending me to live with some kind of old sea hermit she met in a pub one day or something. Finally, as the rain begins to subside, we pull up to the docks. Owen pops the trunk and stalks around to the back of the car. I sigh as I hear his muffled, annoying voice. \"Are you gonna help me with this shit or not?\" I roll my eyes. \"Can your puny body not handle two pieces of luggage?\" All I have with me is my suitcase and guitar case. Granted, there is probably several months' worth of clothing stuffed into said tiny suitcase, but hey, I'm a girl. It's kind of a necessity. Owen gives me another death glare. \"Alright, whatever.\" I say, grabbing my stuff. I'm better off carrying it anyway. He probably wants to dump everything I have into the water right now. We are met at the end of the dock by 3 kind-of-sketchy-looking boatmen who take my stuff and set it on their tiny tugboat. (At this point I'm thinking Owen has sold me into slavery and these creepy guys are taking me to their creep island HQ where I will be forever imprisoned.) \"Well\" Owen says, standing tall and straight. \"I suppose this is goodbye. You watch yourself on that…filthy ship.\" He outstretches his hand, expecting me to shake it. \"Good riddance.\" I say, ignoring him, as I step onto the cramped boat. With the push of a button, the engine roars to life (as much as a tugboat can roar) and heads out into the rough waters of the North Sea. \"There she is!\" one of the men announce as we approach a lit, rundown ship in the darkness. My eyes widen as I see the large, white letter painted on its side. RADIO ROCK I stare for a moment, collecting my thoughts. \"There must be a mistake.\" I tell the boatmen quickly. \"I'm supposed to be meeting my father, Quientin.\" \"That's where you're goin', love\" \"But…this is the Radio Rock ship. Hold on, are you telling me my father is a DJ for Radio Rock?\" The man smiles. \"That's somethin' you'll have to find out for yourself, now isn't it, darling?\" I can't believe it. I don't have to see Owen possibly ever again, I'm meeting my father (who is might be a DJ for one of the most popular pirate radio stations in all of Great Britian,) AND I get a free trip aboard Radio Rock. I have to be dreaming. I was born in America, and lived there most of my life until my mom met Owen and we moved here. I wasn't very knowledgeable about British stuff, but it didn't take me long at all to discover Radio Rock. All the friends I made, and basically every other young person in my generation, usually had the station on all day. They played great music. Stuff you could really dance to, stuff my friends and I always partied to. They won't believe me when I write to them about this. Myself and one of the men climb the thin ladder to the boat's deck. \"This way.\" He says as he picks up my bags and carries them for me. I wince as he holds my guitar case. That thing is more precious to me than my unborn child. I follow him through a heavy metal entryway and a few small corridors. He stops in front of a room with a large, wooden door. He knocks. \"Enter.\" Comes a voice from the other side. The door opens to the sight of an older man in a plaid-grey suit and patterned scarf standing in the middle of a room stacked with papers, old books, a desk, and a typewriter. He positively exudes cool. \"You must be Amy.\" Quentin says with a smile. \"That's me\" I say awkwardly, still a bit in shock from the surrounding. There's a bit of silence. \"So, how are you?\" \"Fine.\" I reply. It's a lie and he knows it. My father smirks. \"Darling, lying will get you nowhere in life. Well, unless you're a politician. Or maybe a hop in bed with a woman. Or in your case a man, or whatever you prefer. But that's beside the point.\" I laugh. I'm really starting to like this guy. \"So Mary's dead? That's a shame. She was my first love, you know. And she said in her will she wanted you to live with me?\" \"Pretty much.\" Quentin smiles again. \"Spectacular mistake on her part.\" He takes a drink of some kind of alcoholic beverage, than grabs my stuff and walks out of the room. \"Come along!\" he shouts back to me, and I immediately follow. \"So I see you're musically apt?\" Quentin asks, eyeing my guitar and then throwing my bags in a random room. \"Yea.\" I reply. \"Self-taught.\" \"Wonderful.\" He says spinning around to face me. \"I think you'll fit in quite well around here. Now, let's go meet the family.\" He leads me to a type of living room area where there's a foosball table, a dartboard, a bar, a small kitchen on the side, and DJ's scattered everywhere. I instantly recognize most of them. Dave, Angus, and the Count are over by the bar, while John from news and weather plays foosball. The first one I really see, though, is Simon. His bright blue eyes lock on my hazel pair and for a moment they're the only thing I can see. I smile a goofy grin and butterflies start to flit around in my stomach. I silently tell them to go away as I become slightly flustered, looking away shyly. He smiles back at me. Quentin clears his throat. \"Attention all, I'd like to introduce you to my daughter, Amy. She'll be staying with us until she's bored.\" I nod and give a small Hello in everyone's general direction and then follow my newfound father around, making introductions. It goes well enough. Everyone is very friendly. Seeing as I'm the only straight woman to be on the boat in a while, they all flock to me with flirtatious grins. But it was different when I get around to Simon. The butterflies flutter furiously this time as I shake his hand. He smiles at me, genuinely, and I flash him back a brilliant one of my own. \"It's really nice to meet you. I've heard you're morning show a few times before.\" \"Well you'll get to hear it all the time now.\" He replies in his Irish accent. We both laugh. He's adorable . I think as we lock eyes again. \"Well, welcome aboard.\" He finally says. \"So gentleman\" Quentin speaks above the mindless chatter and the room falls silent. \"This means that there will be, for the first time, a woman living on the boat. No offense felicity.\" \"None taken.\" She speaks from the group. \"And she is\" continues Dad \"Most definitely not allowed to fall in love, or in bed, with any of you.\" I walk over to Dave's pack of cigarettes lying in front of him on the bar counter and steal one from the box. \"Hope you guys can handle it.\" I say, lighting up a fag and throwing them a wink. The guys all gape and laugh and I throw one more smile at Simon. \"I like her.\" I hear the Count say as I walk away in search of the random room Quentin threw my stuff into. I'm tired and ready to collapse into a bed or a cot or whatever it is ships have for bedding. I open every door I come across in the corridors and peek in, looking desperately for my clothes and guitar. After what seems like the 100th door I come across, I finally find my luggage in fair condition considering all that it's been through. The room isn't half-bad either; a decent size with a small bed taking up most of the room. It's a little bare but it's…cozy. I throw myself onto the mattress and smile. I'm living on the Radio Rock ship with my heroes, some of the coolest people in the world. \"Mom, you really outdid yourself on this one.\" I swear I can hear her laughing. I let myself relax and drift off to sleep with the sound of the Stones echoing through the huge ship. It's heaven.[Chapter 2] A/N - Hello Again! Just want to stop by and say thank you for the positive review! It's making me happy that people actually read this story because honestly I didn't think anyone would. So yay for people! Also, if you haven't noticed, all the titles of these chapters will be named after popular songs of the '60s. Chapter 1 was obviously Bob Dylan's and today's fine chapter happens to be named after \"One Fine Day\" by Chiffons. So once again, grab your record player and some vinyls and Jump Into the Fog with Me... Chapter 2 – One Fine Day The next few days go by great. Owen always used to yell at me for blaring my records and the radio too loud, but now I get to live on a boat that blared those records 24 hours a day and hangout with the DJs who play them. It's also pretty nice to find a fellow American in the sea of British accents around me. The Count's cool, too. He'd been my favorite DJ ever since Gavin left, although, I will admit I pictured him to be a bit more…attractive. It doesn't matter, though. Neither does his chain-smoking or over-use of various curse words. He and Simon have been my best friends from the start. I've really warmed up to the whole Quentin-being-my-dad thing as well. By looking at him you wouldn't think he was the affectionate type of guy, but from day one he's treated me less like someone he just found out existed and more like a daughter who's just returned from a long trip and been greatly missed. The guys are great too. I admit, I was pretty nervous at first. But can you blame me? Living on a ship with some of the most popular icons of our time is a little intimidating. But when you get to know them, they're really not. They're really just a bunch of misfits who live for music. And I can relate. It's a warm yet overcast day, and the 2 week anniversary of my arrival on Radio Rock. I'm sat on the deck smoking a cigarette and laughing at Angus as he broadcasts. (Laughing AT him. Not WITH him, just to be clear.) As I suck the last bit of smoke into my lungs and throw the butt into the North Sea, Dave approaches me with an interesting offer. \"10 quid to smash four eggs over my head?\" I repeat. \"That's it?\" \"That's it.\" He says with a mischievous smile. I eye him suspiciously. He's definitely up to something, I can tell, but if I can get 10 pounds out of it why not? So I agree. He leads me to the boiler room where a carton of eggs already lay innocently on the table. Simon is in the corner reading a book about woodpeckers and glances up questioningly as we enter. \"Amy, here, has agreed to let me smash four eggs over her head in exchange for ten pounds.\" Explains Dave. \"Is that so?\" The Count sounds almost sarcastic as he walks into the room and sits next to Simon. \"Sounds like a good deal to me.\" He lights up a cigarette and takes a puff. Simons eyes widen as he looks from the Count, then to Dave, then to me. He opens his mouth to say something, but closes it as he's shot a warning look from Dave. Great. I sit in the chair Dave pulls out for me. \"Alright\" I say. \"Let's get this over with.\" The Count stifles a laugh while Dave takes the first egg out of the carton. \"Right\" he begins. \"Egg number one.\" It's brought down onto my head with a sickening crack, oozing down my face and clinging sloppily to my pure black hair. The Count laughs loudly and Simon hides a tiny grin as egg number two slides down the pale skin of my face. I hide a visible cringe at the slimy feeling. \"œuf trough\" Dave announces proudly, smashing egg three on me. Suddenly, he pauses. \"You know what? I shan't cast egg four.\" I stare at him. \"What? So I only get…\" I pause to calculate what ¾ of ten pounds is. \"Whatever ¾ of ten quid is?\" I really shouldn't have dropped out of school. \"Actually, the deal was ten pounds for four eggs. I only smashed three.\" I stare more intensely. \"So I don't get anything? How the fuck is that fair?\" \"Well, my dear, that is the lesson learned here; life is not fair.\" The room bursts into laughter, all except me of course. I didn't want a stupid life lesson, I want my ten fucking pounds! While the three stooges are too busy laughing at my naivety, I stealthily walk over to the carton of eggs, grab one in each hand, and merrily smash Dave and the Count over the head with them. They freeze, looks of surprise and disgust crossing their faces in an amusing way. Simon basically keels over laughing, his page in his woodpecker book long since lost. But I'm not as stealthy grabbing this egg and the smile drops from his face as he sees me and bolts out the door. I sprint after him, rounding corridors and down hallways. As I finally catch up to him, I jump onto his back and smash the round, white food item right over his head. He falls over, laughing and cringing from the slimy substance falling down his face, taking me with him. We end up toppled over on the floor breathing heavily and laughing hysterically. \"You\" he finally said, catching his breath \"are a fast runner.\" I giggle. \"It's been said.\" I reply as I extend a hand and help him up.

So this weekend I watched The Boat That Rocked , or in Canada it's Pirate Radio but whatever. So, knowing myself well enough, my imagination went a little mad. So I'm writing a sequel! It might turn out like crap but whatever, I can't get it out of my head. Disclaimer: I do not own The Boat That Rocked , or any of it's characters. Nor do I own the artists mentioned in the story. But I do own additional OC's added and the plot. :D \"By the summer of 1967, The Golden Age of Pirate Radio was over, but their big dream never died.\" \"Did it really?\" \"On August 10th, 1967 American DJ and former member of Radio Rock, The Count, and the Captain of the ship, Quentin, formed a small team and held a meeting concerning all the once members of the now illegal Pirate Radio station.\" It was a warm and muggy day in the south end of London. The sun was out, yet is was shielded from humanity by heavy rainclouds. Perhaps it would rain in the near future, no one really knew. Stood against various, paint chipped, crumbling buildings stood the Greenman's Pub. Greenman's had been there for quite a while, nearly twenty years. It was a favorite of college kids to spend a Saturday night; gambling, drinking, picking up the pretty girls who flocked there. During the week it was the place of old grumpy men, who wanted a drink and to talk to their comrades in peace. On this particular Thursday afternoon, around three o'clock, many different faces began to appear at the entrance of the pub. They all were different, in voices, looks, personalities. However, they all shared one thing in common: Their taste for the best music around. Carl had been the first to arrive there. Wearing a plain blue jumper, collared white shirt and grey slacks he seemed to feel a little formal for his surroundings. It looked like a rough place. He could handle it though, after all he was expelled from school. He laughed at the memory. He was in his senior year, and got expelled for doing pot. He didn't think it was a big deal. Maybe it was, when after him and his friends got incredibly stoned they decided to go about the dormitories of the institute and draw and write some vulgar things on all the hallway walls with permanent ink. It was for shits and giggles, all and all. Then, after he was expelled his wild yet posh mother sent him away to live with Carl's godfather, her old \"friend\" (What Carl meant by \"friend\" was a fair weather friend of his mother's and they probably had sex every time they saw each other. The proof behind this was simply his Mum. Quite the party animal, he had heard many stories about her he did not wish to hear) Quentin. And Quentin happened to be the Captain of the best place on earth, Radio Rock, a large Pirate Radio station that floated on the high seas. A place of simply, sex, drugs and rock and roll. That was the best time of his life. He made some great friends, met his long lost father, fell in love, lost his virginity (stating the above) and got into some things that would cause him so much trouble in the real world that was completely approved of on the boat. It was like there was no rules. It was perfect. Then, the authorities got involved. They hated Radio Rock. Carl simply couldn't put his finger on why they did. Who wouldn't like something as great as Rock and Roll? But they did. And they went and made it illegal. The problems started then. The members had a great idea: Rebel the law put out and set sail. It seemed great, but the reality wasn't so. Shortly after setting sail, the engine of the ship blew, and it started to sink. Moments before everyone's death, fans of the area came out to rescue the crew. And that brought him home. Things were alright after that. He was going steady with the girl of his dreams, Marianne, but that was the only really nice thing. He was eighteen, didn't have much of an education and jobless. Plus, there wasn't twenty-four hours of rock being played. So he searched. Searched for jobs under his mother's command, which was quite difficult. Until one day a piece of luck was brought to him. He didn't know if it was luck but he prayed it sure would be. A few days ago he received a letter from one of his friends on the boat, the lead Disc Jockey, The Count. It had specifically told him to meet at Greenman's pub today, for a talk. He didn't know who was coming, he hoped he wasn't alone in this. Carl was suddenly a little shy. He could go on in the pub, but was slightly afraid of the possibilty of being all alone with bartender and the awkwardness that would come with it. So he stood outside, kicking the gravel with this scuffed up basketball shoes. He suddenly wondered what The Count wanted to say. Would he think up a new way to outsmart the government? Probably not. After all they had no boat or no records. Maybe he got me a job with someone? Or maybe he was just saying farewell and that we had a good run. Carl's thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the screeching of car tires coming up around the corner. Out from behind a building came a 1964 Red Mustang. It was swerving madly, as if the driver was crazy or extremely intoxicated. Oh no, Carl thought. The car was coming right for him. It quickly did a U-turn and slid right in front of Carl, who with instinct jumped out of the way. It skidded to a stop, and the engine was cut. The doors didn't even open when Midnight Mark hopped out the driver's seat window. Great , Carl thought, not only is he one-hundred percent more of a bird magnet then me, but he can drive like a complete badass . Don't get him wrong, Carl did like Mark, but sometimes his almost perfect sex appeal made Carl a little jealous. Mark was wearing a pair of sunglasses, leather pants with a matching jacket and no shirt of underneath, and looking rather like Jim Morrison. Following him out of the car was his fellow friends, Thick Kevin, who was wearing a large grin on his face and \"nut\" Angus, who rather clumsily stumbled out of the vehicle. At the sight of Carl, Nut yelled with joy, \"Young Carl!\" and sprinted over to him. Angus grabbed Carl's shoulder's and said happily, \"You got a note too? My god, maybe your joining the crew Little Carl!\" Then threw himself into an embrace with Carl. Carl was trying hard not to laugh, and hugged him back appreciatively. Kevin came over, still grinning. \"Hullo mate.\" \"Hello, miss me as your roomie?\" Carl asked after breaking away from Nutsford. \"Absolutely, mate. Don't know if there could be a better one then you. Except that you could see me hiding under the blankets,\" He said, chuckling. Carl laughed. \"Well, I'm glad so, it's a tad creepy, don't you think?\" They both erupted in laughter, while The Nut joined in. It surprised them both when Mark joined in laughing. \"Hey Mark,\" Carl said, while Mark slickly saluted back using two fingers to greet him. The lad never said a word. Soon enough, another car was pulling up. It was fairly weather beaten, and had a large peace sign painted on the back. Then, another car. Soon several cars were parking next to the Pub, all members of Pirate Radio. Everyone that Carl loved like a brother (except for Felicity you could say he loved her like a sister) was there. There was many cries of happiness and hugs going around. Nearly everyone had jumped on Carl and squeezed him tight. He like it too, being loved. It was something special. All of the happiness of seeing each other and the anxiety of what the meeting was for was all muddled up in a giant ball of excitement, that flowed like an energy. There was The Count, Gavin, Quentin, Mark, Bob, Dr. Dave, Felicity, Mark, Kevin, Angus, John and Harold. It didn't take Carl long to notice that there was someone missing from the group. \"Where's Simon?\" Carl asked aloud. Speak of the devil. \"CARL!\" Simon yelled from behind him, then excitedly jumped on his back, hugging him. Laughing, Carl said, \"How are you, Simon?\" He promptly shook Simon off, then hugged him properly. He looked as happy as ever. Simon had been through alot for himself to take. His wife had left him for Gavin after simply seventeen hours of marrige, and he survived it. Now he looked great. There was a childish sparkle in his eyes, and a large grin on his face. He said in a hushed voice, \"Do you think we're getting back together?\" Carl shrugged. \"I really don't know, Simon. I guess we'll have to see.\" Now, with everyone there, the crew began to proceed into the pub. Carl silently wondered if they would all fit in there. The pub was warm, or cozy as some would say. With peeling emerald green paint on the walls and chestnut brown floors and iron chandeliers it offered a feeling of home to Carl. But now, Carl wasn't exactly sure where home was. The grizzled and elderly bartender had looks of awe as everyone began to take seats. Carl took a seat next to Dr. Dave at the end of a table. \"Hello Carl,\" Dave greeted him with a smile. \"Hi Dave, how've you been?\" Dave sighed. \"Not too great. Without the boat it's been harder for me to find a lady. Seems they don't like the beefy ones anymore.\" Carl couldn't help snickering. \"Attention fellow rockers!\" Quentin's voice came from the front of the bar. The loud chatter that was going on faded and everyone turned to him. He was standing attentively, looking in command at the front, beside The Count who also looked as if he was Quentin's assistant. \"You must be all wondering why we brought you here today,\" Quentin said. The Count stepped forward. \"It's been three months since Radio Rock was banned and our ship sank, leaving us all with nothing to really live for,\" He said. There were several nods of agreement across the room. \"But, in those three months that I was living in Quentin's basement\" -He sent a look of appreciation towards Quentin- \"I had an epiphany.\" Some hushed whispers filled the room. \"Radio Rock may have been outlawed in the U.K, however, it isn't in the land of pride and freedom-\" \"Canada!\" Newsreader John shouted. The Count laughed, then said, \"America. We can still take America.\" Please R&R; :D[Chapter 2] \"What?\" Cried Dave. The room was suddenly filled with blabbering chatter. \"That's absurd!\" Newsreader John exclaimed. \"But our ship!\" \"Our records!\" \"Our fans!\" \"Everything is gone!\" The Count smiled. \"Our money isn't.\" Then, everyone seemed to remember. They had never really given a thought about the profits they made with Radio Rock, after all they didn't need much but food, which was cheap because Felicity was good friends with the owner of the food store that supplied them. Come to think of it, they didn't really spend much money at all. Well, money can't buy me love, as the lads say. \"With advertising over the years, at the most, we have made a rather large amount of\"- The Count rubbed his fingers to his thumbs in the air - \"Money.\" \"Probably around, I'd say... 2000.00 quid,\" Quentin said, blandly. The was a gasp in the room. It stayed quiet until Gavin broke the silence. In his deep and throaty voice he said, \"My god. We're rich bastards.\" There was sudden cheers of delight in the room, until The Count shushed them, and continued, \"With those generous profits we made, I was able to do a little pre-planning... To tell you the truth, actually, I bought a boat.\" \"How?\" \"Remember that fellow, the old fisherman, Bill who brought people out on to the boat for us? Well, I was talking to him a while ago and he told me that his brother in law had a nice Ship for sale, cheap price and in good condition. I just couldn't refuse the offer, so I bought it. It's great. It spacy, comfortable and has more room then the last boat! And it's equipped to sail the seas, so we won't have any trouble there,\" The Count said, proudly. The room was silence. Carl thought everyone there was flabbergasted. He knew he was. We're setting sail again? He asked himself. Then the realization hit him. \"This is great,\" Carl said aloud, \"I mean, there's going to be a Radio Rock again!\" Once again, this statement caused jeers of happiness, laughter and bubbly excitement. \"I'll get to D.J. again!\" Cried Simon. \"I'll have a house again!\" Yelled Bob. \"The girls will be back!\" Dave said, grinning. \"Let's not get too excited now,\" Gavin directed to the group, then turned to The Count. \"What exactly are the tactics to this plan?\" \"I was just getting to that,\" The Count said, shooting a look of friendly competition towards Gavin, which Gavin slyly returned. \"The next thing we have to focus on is records. All of ours were lost when the ship sink, and we need to replace them. I need all of you to help with this one. Try friends, family, anyone, try to get records. I'm going to look into the record companies, and see if they can get us a deal for certain artists. I'm talking the bigwigs, EMI, Parlophone, all of that stuff. We can also have a fundraiser or something, to see if fans want to give us money or records.\" \"Also, we need a broadcasting system,\" Quentin added. \"Ooh! I've got one of those! It's in my Mum's basement!\" Angus cried. \"Excellent,\" Quentin said, clapping his hands together. It seemed all set in place to Carl, except for just one thing. Hesitantly, he raised his hand. \"Yes, Carl,\" The Count acknowledged. \"Er-\" Carl started, \"How exactly are we going to get people's attention in America?\" \"Good question,\" The Count said, grinning. \"I like to think of it this way, like we're The Beatles in 1963. We've achieved mainstream success in our territory, now we're trying to get popular in the holy land. How did they do that?\" Gavin smirked. \"They released I Want To Hold Your Hand and all the American birds loved it.\" \"Yes... But how did they get to that point?\" \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" Felicity said bashfully. \"Exactly.\" \"Your mad!\" Bob cried. \"The Ed Sullivan Show is for goodie-goodies! He'd never let us advertise on his show! We can't!\" \"I wasn't thinking that we'd advertise on his show. I was more thinking that we could advertise his show! I think we would get more views on that!\" \"Ahem,\" Came a voice from behind the bar. Everyone turned to face the old and withered bartender. \"It's closin' time,\" He said gruffly, gesturing to the clock on the wall. \"It says you close around ten,\" Quentin argued curtly. \"We close early tonight. Me wife wants me home for dinner, lads,\" The bartender said irritatedly. \"Sorry. We'll be out in a few minutes,\" Quentin said, and the bartender nodded. \"I guess that's it for now, but we can meet again soon. Let's say, er, tomorrow at the docks, I'll show you the ship,\" The Count announced. \"And congratulations to all of us.\" With that, the crow of D.J.'s and friends began to disperse, hugging each other goodbyes. They were all happy with the news they had just received, excitement of meeting again tomorrow shot through them like the blood in their viens. I'm so sorry for the wait! The next chapter might be a while, I'm going on a class trip for the week! Keep reading! - Love Cannedtuna. :D ","Summary":" AU/ Hello everybody! So this weekend I watched The Boat That Rocked , or in Canada it's Pirate Radi"},{"Movie":"Boat That Rocked","Title":"Daphné","Author":"Urban miss","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9485108","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Bonjour à tous ! Voilà, je suis nouvelle sur le site, et ceci est l'introduction de ma toute première fanfiction. J'espère être lue et qui sait, appréciée ?… Sur ce, bonne lecture ! Où l'on rencontre une fille bizarre et déterminée. Bah, l'héroïne, quoi. Daphné Rickett se considérait comme une fille patiente. Vraiment. Elle avait tout de même passé 17 ans de sa vie auprès de ses parents SANS commettre de meurtre. Bon, en contrepartie, elle devait bien admettre qu'une bonne partie de sa santé mentale s'était évanouie quelque part dans les méandres profonds et inexplorés de son cerveau. Mais pour en revenir à notre sujet, oui, Daphné avait développé tout au long de son enfance et son adolescence des trésors de patience dont Gandhi ne pourrait que rêver : elle s'était occupée de sa (*tousse* SALOPE DE *tousse*) petite sœur pendant que ses géniteurs allaient se plaindre de leur affreuse petite fille dans une quelconque fête de la haute société, avait passé 7 ans (7 PUTAINS D'ANNEES) dans l'école privée où on l'avait inscrite de force, avait travaillé assez pour conserver une moyenne honorable et obtenir son bac avec la mention Très bien, s'était trouvé un job pour pouvoir se payer ses cigarettes, ses vinyles et sa radio adorée, et avait même réussi à faire accepter à ses parents son athéisme, chose dont elle était particulièrement fière. Mais surtout, pendant toutes ces années, elle n'avait jamais élevé la voix contre qui que ce soit de sa famille (sauf sa petite sœur. Mais c'était justifié, parce qu'être une peste à ce point-là, ce n'était même plus de la mesquinerie, ça tenait du machiavélisme). Alors, lorsque le jour de ses 18 ans arriva, Daphné ne se posa pas la question de savoir si elle restait ou non. Ses valises étaient prêtes depuis des semaines. « Alors, réserve de fringues, réserve de spéculoos, cigarettes, argent, papiers, trousse de toilette, radio, vinyles… Normalement c'est tout ce dont j'ai besoin. » Daphné finit par fermer son unique bagage après une énième vérification. Enfin, c'était le grand soir. La libération. La possibilité d'un nouveau départ, une nouvelle vie, et peut-être même une nouvelle Daphné, qui sait ? Mais là n'était pas le principal. Elle laissa son regard se promener sur ce qui bientôt ne serait plus sa chambre. Les murs colorés d'un beige sobre et ennuyeux, qu'elle avait pris soin de dénuder de tous ses précieux posters des Who, des Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, The Rolling Stones, et tant d'autres. Ces affiches, elle les emmèneraient avec elle, sans laisser aucune trace, aucun indice de sa présence. Elle scruta les moindres détails de cette pièce dans laquelle elle s'était enfermée de si nombreuses fois, pour pleurer, pour rire, pour danser, pour écouter de la musique, pour fumer, pour vivre, mais surtout pour échapper à la routine des disputes familiales à propos de son avenir. Elle savait que le plus grand rêve de ses parents était de la voir devenir médecin, mais elle ne désirait pas poursuivre ce genre d'études : classiques, monotones, et en plus de ça difficiles. Elle, d'un autre côté, voulait simplement profiter de la vie : voyager, rencontrer des centaines de personnes différentes, avec des cultures, des personnalités différentes entendre des musiques et goûter des plats du monde entier, et par-dessus tout, s'amuser. Elle avait bien conscience que ses rêves étaient similaires à ceux de la moitié de sa génération, mais cela ne la dérangeait pas vraiment, et même si elle se doutait bien qu'elle aurait besoin de faire des études et de travailler un jour ou l'autre, elle avait décidé de prendre une année pour enfin s'éloigner de son étouffant cocon familial et faire ce qui lui plaisait avec ses amis. Ses yeux se fixèrent sur la petite horloge grise clouée au mur au-dessus de son lit. Il ne s'agissait plus que de quelques minutes… Quelques secondes… \"AND FREEDOM IS MINE , BITCHES !\" Daphné s'autorisa une petite danse de la joie, seule dans sa chambre, à minuit (ce qui, une fois formulé comme ça, peut paraître pour le moins étrange) avant d'empoigner fermement sa valise et de claquer la porte de sa chambre pour quitter immédiatement la maison où elle avait vécu 18 ans de cauchemar. « Daphné ! Pourrais-tu si ce n'est pas trop te demander m'expliquer ce que tu fiches sur le pas de la porte en pleine nuit ?» … En tout cas plus ou moins immédiatement. « Euh… Uiiii, maman, ne t'énerves pas… couina-t-elle avant de se ressaisir (elle était majeure, bon sang, elle faisait ce qu'elle voulait à présent !), je veux dire, ça ne te regarde pas, maintenant que j'ai 18 ans, je peux aller où je veux, à l'heure que je veux, na ! » Un gros silence s'ensuivit au cours duquel Daphné se maudit intérieurement pour son piètre talent d'argumentation. Sa mère poussa un soupir. « Tu raconte n'importe quoi, comme d'habitude. Retourne te coucher, ton père et moi discuterons de ta sanction demain matin. - Non. - Je te demande pardon ? - Excuses acceptées, répondit la jeune fille avec un sourire angélique. - Pour l'amour du ciel, cesse de te moquer de moi et pour une fois, fais ce que je te dis sans rechigner. - Malheureusement pour toi, il se trouve qu'à compter d'aujourd'hui, ce que tu dis n'a plus aucune influence sur mes actions, ne t'en déplaise. » La mère de Daphné en resta bouche bée. Elle n'était pas habituée à ce que l'on s'oppose à elle, du moins pas si ouvertement. C'est alors qu'elle remarqua quelque chose d'inhabituel sur le visage de sa fille : son expression terriblement dure et sérieuse. Elle ne l'avait jamais vue ainsi. D'ordinaire, Daphné avait tendance à prendre tout ce qui lui arrivait à la légère : elle sortait une conn…une idiotie, tout le monde se moquait d'elle, elle riait, et passait à autre chose. Mais cette fois, et pour la première fois en 18 ans de vie commune, la splendide quadragénaire qu'était Mme Rickett apercevait un tout autre aspect de l'adolescente : une implacable détermination. Elle l'aurait presque admirée. Presque. « Je ne comprends rien à ce que tu dis. Qu'est-ce qu'il te faut encore ? Qu'est-ce que tu veux qu'on ne te donne pas ? Tu as passé l'âge de faire des caprices. -Oh, mais ne t'inquiètes pas, il ne s'agit pas d'un caprice. Mais si tu veux vraiment tout savoir, dès demain, vous n'aurez plus à vous préoccuper de moi. Je m'en vais. » La mère de Daphné resta silencieuse un moment. Puis, lentement, elle tourna le dos et commença à grimper les escaliers, avant de se raviser et de lancer : « Fais ce que tu veux. Mais surtout ne reviens pas. » Daphné se tut et regarda disparaître au coin du couloir la femme qui, pour une raison inconnue de tous, l'avait mise au monde. Elle s'était attendue à un peu plus de résistance face au départ de quelqu'un d'aussi génial, d'aussi magnifique, d'aussi parfait qu'elle ( non, elle n'était pas orgueilleuse. En tout cas pas tout le temps ), mais elle ne pouvait pas dire que cela lui faisait énormément de peine. Il y avait longtemps que tous les sentiments qu'elle éprouvait pour ses parents s'étaient fondus en une vague d'indifférence qui avait submergé tout le reste. Alors elle se tourna et passa la porte. « Vers l'infini… Et au de-SBAM. Et ceci, mesdames et messieurs, était le bruit d'une jeune femme en train de prendre son envol vers la liberté (ou plus exactement de se ramasser misérablement la gueule sur son perron). Revieeeews ? J'accepte tout, les encouragements, les critiques, les insultes, les lamentations, tout, je vous dis. Je pense publier à peu près une fois par semaine. Alors, bonne journée, de la part de Urban miss ![Chapter 2] CHAPITRE 1 Où l'on apprend que personne ne peut arrêter Midnight Mark, pas même le gouvernement. Et que la tequila, c'est le diable. Il était près de 10 heures lorsque Mark se réveilla et tomba nez à nez avec une forme qu'il connaissait bien, celle du corps d'une femme encore voilé par les draps blancs qui avait été les seuls témoins de leurs doux ébats. Aaaaah… Parfois, vraiment, il adorait sa vie. Le légendaire séducteur laissa son regard se promener sur sa cabine toute neuve. Après le naufrage de Radio Rock, le public s'était ligué contre la loi de sécurité maritime. Au bout de trois semaines de grève dans divers secteurs d'emploi, le gouvernement britannique s'était vu forcé de se plier aux exigences des citoyens furieux (Mark n'avait pas trop su s'il devait se sentir flatté ou gêné en apercevant dans une manifestation des pancartes affichant fièrement « Rien à foutre des pêcheurs qui coulent, Midnight Mark est au-dessus de ça »). Une rumeur circulait même à propos d'un ministre qui serait tombé en dépression nerveuse et aurait hurlé en plein milieu d'une réunion d'Etat particulièrement importante « Mais tout ça c'est la faute à trou de balle ». En même temps, il fallait le comprendre : le gouvernement avait dû fournir un nouveau bateau au groupe de Radio Rock. Tous frais payés. Et le moins que l'on puisse dire, c'est que lorsque Quentin avait entendu cette expression dans la bouche de l'envoyé du ministère, le sourire qui s'était étalé sur son visage avait quelque chose de… Comment dire… D'inquiétant. Mark songea un instant qu'il vivait sur un bateau qui avait tout de même coûté assez cher pour faire blêmir d'horreur une bande de politiciens qui gagnaient assez en une année pour s'acheter la Maison Blanche. Cool , se dit-il avec décontraction. Parce que qui dit plus d'argent, dit plus de place. Donc plus grandes cabines. Donc plus grands lits. Don plus de sexe. Gaaaaah… Il faudra que je me souvienne de remercier le crétin qui a eu l'idée de cette loi de sécurité maritime. Ce mec a réussi l'exploit d'améliorer une vie sexuelle déjà parfaite. Le DJ se tourna ensuite vers sa dernière conquête, encore endormie. Bon… Et comment je la vire, moi, c'te gonzesse ? C'est pas qu'elle me dérange, mais faudrait pas qu'elle se fasse des idées comme la dernière. J'arrive pas croire qu'il a fallu la décrocher du rebord du bateau. En plus, elle parlait de trucs bizarres, avec des histoires de « mariage » et « d'enfants », j'ai rien pigé. Mark soupira. Il fallait dire, aussi, que la vie d'un playboy était loin d'être simple. Toutes ces filles à larguer… C'était tellement fatiguant… (une mauvaise conscience, quelle mauvaise conscience ?) Il finit donc par se lever et décida d'employer la méthode la plus simple. Avec un peu de chance, cette fille ne se réveillerait pas avant que la navette l'ait ramenée à terre… Il monta donc sur le pont pendant que les employés du bateau emmenaient doucement la jeune femme endormie au loin, et s'assit pour prendre un petit déjeuner digne du mâle dominant après sa nuit d'exploits sexuels intenses et répétés, tout en écoutant Angus ( cet abruti, quand est-ce qu'il va apprendre à mettre des fringues de notre époque ? ) déblatérer à propos de cette fille, Daphné Stalton, qu'il avait commencé à fréquenter après avoir passé un excellent sexamedi avec elle. Tous les animateurs radio eurent une pensée compatissante commune pour la pauvre fille qui avait été assez stupide pour tomber amoureuse du « gugusse » de la bande. « … Je lui ai même composé une chanson. Elle s'intitule : Daphné, ma muse, faisons mumuse ! » A cet instant précis, toutes les Daphné du Suffolk, y compris notre Miss Rickett, éternuèrent violemment. Quant à Mark, il fut pris d'une soudaine envie de se cogner la tête contre la table du petit déjeuner. Fort. Ou bien de forcer cet imbécile à avaler la cigarette qu'il venait d'allumer. C'est donc en éternuant que Daphné se réveilla ce matin-là. Elle se leva lentement. Et courut pour atteindre les toilettes à temps pour éviter de vomir sur… Qui était-ce, à côté d'elle, une fille à poil ? Bah, aucune importance, elle s'occuperait de ça plus tard. Pour le moment, le plus urgent restait cette saloperie de gueule de bois à la con… Je savais que j'aurais pas dû faire ce concours de descente de tequila, bizarrement, c'est le seul alcool qui me rende complètement soûle. En même temps, le joint qu'elle avait fumé avant n'avait pas vraiment aidé non plus. Lorsqu'elle eut fini de dégobiller copieusement le contenu de son estomac Daphné alla se brosser les dents et prendre une aspirine ( voire deux. Ou plutôt trois ), et en profita pour jeter un coup d'œil à son reflet dans la glace. Elle sursauta. Elle ne se considérait pas comme un fille laide. Elle avait un visage assez agréable, ovale, avec la peau blanche, le nez fin et droit, les yeux verts un peu en amande, la bouche plutôt pulpeuse, et une sorte de crinière rousse qu'elle avait depuis longtemps renoncé à apprivoiser et s'était donc résignée à couper à la garçonne. Elle avait un corps bien sculpté, grand, mince et élancé, et une poitrine… C'est pour ça que je suis sûre que Dieu n'existe pas, si c'était le cas, j'aurais AU MOINS un bonnet C ! Non, vraiment, en dehors de ce léger complexe (admirez ma maîtrise de l'euphémisme), Daphné se trouvait raisonnablement jolie. Mais voilà, il semblerait que les lendemains de cuite aient le don de ramener même Miranda Kerr à l'état de… Eh bien, de thon. Alors oui, en ce premier jour de majorité, Daphné eut pour la première fois de sa vie peur de son propre reflet. Elle cria. Un grognement retentit depuis l'autre pièce. « 'Tain, il est que 10h30… Tu peux pas souffrir en silence ? -Je t'emmerde, Lili. -Moi aussi je t'aime mon chou. -Hmph. -Et surtout j'adore ton sens de la répartie. -Au risque de me répéter, hmph. Bon, on bouffe ? -Avec plaisir, tu sais cuisiner ? -Tu m'as bien regardée ? -… Ouais, t'es trop cruche pour ça. J'appelle le service de chambre. -Hey ! » Daphné revint dans la chambre d'hôtel (bien qu'elle ne se souvienne pas avoir payé une chambre d'hôtel… Bah, l'alcool, tout ça…) et balança distraitement un oreiller sur la grande blonde qui lui servait de meilleure amie. Lili Holsen, étudiante en droit de 19 ans, se retourna et éclata de rire : « Merde, je comprends pourquoi t'as gueulé, on dirait que t'as pas dormi depuis trois jours… Tu sais qu'avec ton teint tout pâle et tes cernes on dirait un panda ? -La ferme. Et je peux savoir pourquoi toi, t'es toute fraîche et reposée ? -Tout simplement parce que j'ai ingurgité à peu près trois fois moins de substances illicites que toi, et que moi, je suis tombée sur un bon coup du soir. Toi par contre, vu la tête que tu faisais en ressortant des chiotte de la boîte, il devait pas être terrible. -Me souviens pas trop… Au fait, qu'est-ce que tu fous à poil ? C'est pas que j'aime pas la vue, mais j'ai eu des gros doutes en me levant ce matin… -Oh, j'avais chaud, c'est tout. L'idée de coucher avec moi te déplaît à ce point ? » Sa lèvre inférieure se mit à trembler. Regard de chien battu… Intensité maximum. « Moi, ta meilleure amie, avec qui tu partages tout, ma sexualité te répugnerait depuis tout ce temps ? -Tu fais ce que tu veux de ton corps, ma grande, et je pense que si j'avais quoi que ce soit d'une homophobe, ça ferait pas trois ans que je traîne avec toi. Mais entre nous ça ne sera jamais rien de plus que de l'amitié. -Ma petite Daphné est si méchaaaante… Si cruelle… Moi qui t'ai ouvert mon cœur avec innocence et pureté… Comment peux-tu être si froide ? Comment peux-tu rejeter les avances d'une femme si resplendissante ? Lili est triiiiiiste… -ARRETE DE FAIRE SEMBLANT DE PLEURER ! JE PEUX T'ENTENDRE RIRE D'ICI ! -Service de chambre ! Le petit déjeuner est servi ! fit une voix masculine depuis le seuil de la suite. -J'arriiiiiiive ! » s'exclama Lili, toute trace de (fausses) larmes disparue, en allant ouvrir la porte, rayonnante. « Lili ! Non ! Tu es… » Elle ouvrit la porte. «… A poil. -Oups. -C'est le cas de le dire, oui. -Ce pauvre mec, il a l'air choqué, regarde, il bouge plus… -C'est pas grave, comme ça on n'aura pas à lui donner de pourboire. Ferme la porte, il finira bien par se réveiller. A moins qu'il ne meure d'hémorragie nasale avant. -Bon, bah, merci pour le service, jeune homme. Et n'oubliez pas d'éponger tout le sang… » Elle se retrouvèrent ainsi tranquillement assises devant un repas assez royal, auquel Lili se fit un devoir de faire honneur. La future avocate était grande et possédait des formes plutôt généreuses, mais cela ne l'empêchait pas de conserver une extrême sensualité elle ne se privait donc jamais de nourriture. Daphné, en face d'elle, se contenta d'une tasse de café bien noir et d'une assiette de spéculoos, qu'elle grignota en lorgnant le décolleté bien en vue de son amie. « Dis-moi, c'est du combien maintenant ? J'ai l'impression qu'ils ont encore grossi… -Ah oui, t'as remarqué ? C'est du 95D, répondit Lili avec un sourire angélique. -Rappelle-moi pourquoi je ne t'ai pas tuée il y a longtemps. -Parce que la force de mon magnétisme et mon charme naturel t'obligent à m'adorer, quoi que tu en dises. -En même temps, si je te tuais, je pourrais faire transférer ta graisse mammaire sur mon absence de graisse mammaire par chirurgie… -Euh… » La jeune femme préféra prudemment changer de sujet en voyant une aura noire et calculatrice se former autour de Daphné. « Sinon, tu comptes faire quoi maintenant que t'es partie de chez toi ? Parce que, sans vouloir t'inquiéter, si tu veux attendre que j'aie fini mes partiels pour partir en Asie, va falloir que tu te trouves un endroit pour pioncer, ma grande. Moi, je voudrais bien t'accueillir, mais j'ai pas la place… -Ouais, t'inquiètes, je sais. Pour l'instant j'ai de quoi rester à l'hôtel pour une semaine, mais après il faudra que je trouve un pig… Une âme charitable pour m'héberger pendant trois mois. -Je plains cette personne. -Je suis sensée le prendre comment ? -Comme tu veux, par devant ou par derrière ? -… Dégueulasse. -A ton service, chérie. »[Chapter 3] CHAPITRE 2 Où l'on fait la connaissance d'un charmant vol… Jeune homme. Et où le Compte découvre que oui, plus vulgaire que lui, ça existe. Après avoir pris un bon petit déjeuner et encouragé ( forcé ) Lili à se rendre en cours, Daphné décida d'aller faire un tour en ville, histoire de vérifier s'il n'y avait pas un quelconque imbécile heureux prêt à lui fournir un logement pour trois mois. Elle marcha un peu au hasard, flânant ici et là, jusqu'à ce qu'une main se pose brusquement sur son épaule, faisant se hérisser la jeune fille. « NE M'APPROCHEZ PAS ! JE SUIS ARMEE ! J'AI… J'AI… J'AI DES ONGLES ET JE SUIS PRETE A M'EN SERVIR ! » Le propriétaire de la main s'écarta le plus vite possible de sa « victime » pour couvrir ses oreilles. « Je te remercie, Daph', je crois que je viens de perdre à peu près la moitié de mes capacités auditives grâce à toi. -Oh, ce n'est que toi. -Je n'aime pas beaucoup ce « que ». » Il s'agissait d'un grand jeune homme de 22 ans bien bâti, brun au teint mat, dont les yeux marron foncé surplombait un nez aquilin qui conférait à son visage un certain charme. On remarquait surtout sa peau, qui semblait déjà patinée, marquée par la vie malgré son jeune âge. « Alors, Alfie, qu'est-ce qu'un voleur comme toi fait du côté du port de si bon matin ? Je pensais t'apercevoir au marché, les bonnes femmes qui y font leurs courses sont bien plus faciles à rouler… -Chut, je suis ici pour me trouver un boulot. Je veux dire un truc sérieux, officiel et tout, ajouta-t-il devant le regard ironique de son interlocutrice. -Ah ouais, tu vas bosser comme marin, alors ? -Comme pêcheur, en fait. C'est temporaire, juste histoire d'arrondir mes fins de mois et d'avoir une source de revenus un peu plus stable que les pigeons du marché. -A propos de pigeon, je cherche un endroit où habiter pour les trois prochains mois, t'aurais pas un petit tuyau à me filer ? -Si, mais qui te dit que c'est gratuit ? -Toi, t'as envie que je demande à un flic de vérifier ton appart'. Chuis sûre que y'aurait pas mal d'objets soi-disant perdus qu'on pourrait trouver là-bas. -Ca va, ça va, pas besoin d'en arriver là. Bon, alors c'est peut-être pas exactement ce que tu cherches, mais j'ai un pote qui connaît un type qui… Enfin tu vois ce que je veux dire, mais je pense que je pourrais te trouver une place, tiens-toi bien, à bord de la fameuse station radio de Radio Rock. Il paraît qu'ils cherchent quelqu'un pour aider aux corvées ménagères, et qu'en échange ils offrent le gîte et le couvert. -Gratos ? -Ouais. Alors, intéressée ? -…Putain mais carrément ! C'est l'affaire de ma vie, ça, Alfie ! s'écria Daphné, avec des étincelles dans les yeux et oh mon Dieu, je vois des petites particules roses dégoulinantes de bonheur émaner d'elle, mon Dieu ce que ça fait peur… -Ok, dans ce cas dis-moi où tu loges pour l'instant et je viendrai te voir quand il faudra y aller, par contre faudra faire vite pour pas manquer la navette qui peut nous conduire au bateau, donc prépares tes bagages à l'avance. -Ca marche ! » Ils se quittèrent donc après que Daphné ait écrit l'adresse de son hôtel sur un bout de papier, l'une en état d'extase totale, l'autre soulagé que les policiers soient restés en dehors de cette histoire. Soudain, il se souvint de quelque chose et interpella la jeune fille : « Eh, Daph' ! -Ouais, quoi ? -T'as toujours pas assez d'argent pour ton opération de la poitrine ? Parce qu'à ton âge, faut vraiment faire quelque chose, j'ai l'impression que t'es encore plus plate qu'avant… -JE T'EMMERDE ! SACHE QU'UN BONNET B, C'EST PLUS PRATIQUE POUR SE FAIRE PELOTER, PARCE QUE CA TIENT DANS UNE SEULE MAIN ! -Haha, c'est ça, oui ! Allez, bonne journée, ma petite planche à pain ! -REVIENS ICI, TRAÎTRE, OBSEDE, FAUX FRERE,… » Alfie n'entendit pas la suite, car il avait déjà commencé à courir, mais il remercia Dieu, et Bouddha, et tous les saints qu'il connaissait, de ne pas entendre ce que vociférait sa poursuivante, vue l'expression outragée, à la limite de l'apoplexie de tous les passants qu'il croisa. Le Comte vida une énième choppe de bière et poussa un petit soupir d'aise. Depuis que le gouvernement avait payé un nouveau bateau ainsi que des frais pour dommages et intérêts à Quentin, il avait vu son salaire augmenter de manière significative, et pouvait donc désormais s'accorder de petits plaisirs, comme une sortie pour aller tranquillement boire un coup dans un pub et passer une après-midi paisible en ville. Il se leva, paya l'addition, et sortit juste à temps pour voir passer un jeune homme brun, courant comme si sa vie en dépendait (nda : et c'était le cas d'ailleurs. Daphné peut être très violente quand elle veut.), qui arborait une expression étrangement terrifiée. Le Comte se retourna pour voir la chose qui effrayait le garçon à ce point. Et entra en collision avec la chose en question, qui se révéla être une sorte de furie rousse qui proférait des jurons que même lui n'aurait pas osé prononcer. Bien pire que le mot en F. Ou en C. Ou n'importe quelle lettre de l'alphabet, en fait. La chose semblait même connaître des insultes dans une langue étrangère, qu'il supposa être de l'italien. Mais il n'avait pas besoin de comprendre l'italien pour savoir que si la mère de cette fille l'avait entendue, elle l'aurait reniée sur-le-champ. Lorsqu'il se releva, assez sonné, et avec une certaine partie de son anatomie particulièrement endolorie, il tomba nez à nez avec… Non, pas un monstre comme il s'y attendait, mais une ravissante jeune femme inconsciente. Une jolie fille évanouie. Par terre. Juste sous ses yeux. Quelque part dans son cerveau encore embrumé par le choc, un neurone nommé « perversité » lui souffla qu'il pouvait faire des choses absolument splendides (de son point de vue) à cette fille. Un autre neurone appelé « morale » rétorqua qu'il devrait plutôt vérifier si elle n'était pas morte. Perversité lui répondit d'aller se faire voir. Morale lui fit un doigt d'honneur ( oui, je sais qu'en ce bas monde, les neurones n'ont pas de doigts, mais bon sang, faîtes un peu marcher votre imagination pour cette fois. ) Le Comte secoua la tête et décida de réveiller la pauvre fille lorsque l'image étrange de deux neurones en train de se friter s'imposa à son esprit. Il s'agenouilla, s'abaissa doucement et… Lui colla une gifle ( Vous vous attendiez à un truc bien romantique et baveux ? Eeeeeeh non ! ) Ce qui eut pour effet immédiat de se recevoir un coup de poing. La charmante ( HAHAHA ) jeune fille se redressa en marmonnant des choses que le Comte ne VOULAIT PAS entendre. Pas du tout. Plus jamais. Never. Niemals. Mai. Elle releva la tête et prit la parole : « 'Scusez, j'étais en train de courser un salaud, je vous avais pas vu. » Ca, c'était la meilleure excuse qu'on m'ait jamais présenté pour m'avoir quasiment assommé. « Aucun problème » répondit-il avec un sourire Colgate. Parce qu'il était un tombeur, donc un gentleman, quel que soit le niveau de vulgarité langagière de la femme en question. « Vous ne vous êtes pas fait mal, j'espère ? -Nan, votre ventre a amorti ma chute, fit la rousse avec un air angélique. Je vais la massacrer. C'est vrai, quoi, je ne suis pas gros, je suis juste un peu enrobé ! (nda : et voilà comment on fait une référence à une bande-dessinée qui n'est même pas sortie à l'époque où se déroule notre histoire.) « Hem, oui, ravi de le savoir, marmonna-t-il dans sa barbe. Et vous vous appelez ? -Daphné, m'sieur. -… Je vous en supplie, dîtes-moi que votre nom de famille n'est PAS Stalton. -Non, c'est Rickett, pourquoi ça ? » Dieu merci, ce n'est pas la copine du gugusse. Je crois que sans ça j'aurais dû mettre ma galanterie de côté pour la première fois de ma vie. « Oh, pour rien, Daphné. Vous permettez que je vous appelle Daphné, n'est-ce pas ? Nous pourrions même nous tutoyer… Vous comprenez, enfin, tu comprends, quand je vois une si charmante apparition débouler ainsi dans ma vie, je ne peux m'empêcher de me dire que c'est le destin qui nous a réunis… » Mode irrésistible tombeur… Niveau maximum. La fille lui sourit avec amusement. Gagné. « C'est une belle idée, effectivement, ronronna-t-elle. Et pourrais-je savoir comment s'appelle l'homme que le destin a mis sur ma route ? -Voyons voir si tu as un minimum de culture populaire… Ici le Comte, et je compte sur toi pour ce compte à rebours… vers l'extase. » Daphné se tut, et sa bouche forma lentement un O stupéfait tandis que ses yeux s'écarquillaient. « Mais alors… » Je suis dans la merde… Je suis tombée en plein sur mon futur employeur… Littéralement… Mamaaaan… Qu'est-ce qui m'a pris de partiiiir… « Euh… C'est incroyable… Vraiment… Fascinant… Je… J'en reste bouche bée, tu vois… Mais il faut que j'y aille, puisque… Euh… Je dois… Rattraper le mec… Tu sais… Enfin, je veux dire… Euh… Salut ! » Et c'est sur cette belle tirade que Daphné s'esquiva, en piquant un sprint particulièrement impressionnant compte tenu de ses capacités sportives d'ordinaire incroyablement basses. Putain de merde de sa mère de saloperie de bordel à la coooon ! … Je m'arrange pas en grossièreté, moi. Elle laissa derrière elle un Comte pour le moins perplexe, et surtout estomaqué, car pour la première fois de sa vie (non, la deuxième, si on comptait Margaret, mais elle était lesbienne, il avait une bonne excuse !), il venait de se manger un râteau. Et en beauté, avec ça. Un sourire félin étira ses lèvres. J'ai toujours adoré les défis… Daphné, ma poupée rousse, je vais te retrouver. Et tu finiras dans mon lit, quels que ce soient les moyens qu'il me faut employer pour ça… Parc qu'on ne plante pas le Comte du Cool en plein milieu de la rue impunément ! Un gloussement sardonique monta du fond de sa gorge, et enfla, enfla, enfla, jusqu'à devenir un ricanement maniaque, sadique et surtout passablement inquiétant pour le pauvre barman qui avait été témoin de toute la scène. Celui-ci poussa un soupir las et fatigué. Encore un putain de taré qu'il va falloir que je m'occupe de virer à l'heure de fermeture… Pourquoi, mais pourquoi est-ce que je me coltine toujours les clients les plus louches ?

Omar didnt even try, yet he still gets the girl. and dizzy? still always apart of the background. Everyone was backstage rejoycing about thier first concert, Dizzy was too, but one thing didn't seem right. Mok was gone, he saw him with his own eyes, fall into the star shapped hole. Dizzy noticed how Angel clung onto Omar, laughing and kissing. He frowned, Omar never even tried. When Mok took her away in the big black blimp of his, Omar acted like he was ok, he wasnt but was the hard headed, cocky Omar going to admit that? no. then when it came to driving down to Nuke York, he never once spoke about her. He sang and played his guitar, slept, or would sit in silence as the trio drove to get thier pianist. Even at the night club, when we looked, it seemed like he didnt look hard enough. Dizzy would catch Omar's eyes on another girl every now and then. debating. it made Dizzy sick, not to mention that when the concert was in the Ohmtown power plant, which was only a few miles away.(how did they even get back to Ohmtown? last he knew they were at Club666) he said no! that he was done with the rescue buisness, and he saw her and mok together. Deep down in his heart, he KNEW Angel wasnt like that, she would never leave Omar for some creep. part of him wished she did. but not for Mok, no, for him. yeah, he admitted it, he likes Angel. but who wouldnt? with her bright blue eyes, her lucious red lips, and her golden locks. and that voice, that beautiful voice. Everytime they played at bars, it was always Omar who sang. Back at Mylars, when she sang, it was perfect. her voice suit her name well, and thats just what she was. an angel. Now, he frowned, putting his jacket back on. Omar got the girl, Omar, who never tried to get her, never showed that he cared, never even for one moment saw what he saw, got Angel. He felt his stomache twist and turn in jelousy. Omar didnt deserve her. then again, why would a girl like Angel, who shines brightly, never once letting herself fall into the category of damsel in distress, even think about being with him? all he was, was the drummer, who practicly forced Omar into going, drove for the first time in his life for Angel. (not to mention he was deathly afraid of cars and driving, since he lost his parents in a car accident) going to a club, being flashed, (he didnt mind that) and being tourted by the so called lovable rocker, Mok. He pushed his glasses up a bit, sighed and started walking away. He turned back once, only once to see a girl he knew would never see the real Omar, intertwine her hand with his. he felt his heart break slightly. Of course. He continued walking, and apart of him hoped that she would see this and call after him, ask him to stay, which he would try to protest to see how far she wanted him there. Just to make sure, he walked slower than normal, but did it happen? this isnt a movie, so of course not, happy endings dont exist, and just like that he opened the back door to the exit. He sighed, feeling the cool morning air brush past him. He stept outside, seeing the sun peak up from the powerplant, followed by a rainbow. He admired the beauty of it, and aloud he said \"not as beautiful as Angel\" He then stopped and realized something, who was there when Angel was having boy trouble (before her and Omar started to like eachother) he was. who was there, and was forced to listen to Mok with her, because he was her idol, her favorite man? he was. who was drug to the over packed mall, to stand in line for hours just to get a Mok shirt, then go stand in line for a longer time just to get it signed by Mok? he was. Who went with her, to be partally deaf from all the crazy fangirls at a Mok concert? he did. (it was HORRIBLE) and what was Omar doing? blowing her off, because \"Mok was stupid, and hes a creep and all he wants is sex\" or \"theres no way in hell will i go to the mall with you just to get a creepo to write on a shirt\" or \"no, im busy\" or hell, even the silent treatment. Dizzy felt the anger rise in him. No, no more backing down, no more being apart of the background, no more letting Angel be treated like, like...a toy. He took a deep breathe, and turned to the door, just as he opened it... He saw Angel. [End?] _ tell me what you think should i continue?

I'm in a real stew!\" Yet Aunt Edith saw it from a different view \"Alphonse, that's precisely what lessons are for!\" With that, she opened the car's creaking door Once I got seated, but not before, Aunt Edith sat down by me, feet on the floor \"OK,\" said my aunt, demonstrating each trick, \"You're in control of the car with this stick...\" I learned how to park & reverse really quick, And on neutral setting, the car's ride was slick I practiced in parallel parking & brakes, Doing my best not to make any mistakes I did get nervous when I felt the car's shakes, But otherwise, it was a sweet piece of cake!

So, naturally, I had to write a fanfic about it. This is just a one shot of what went on just after the end of the movie. As always, please, enjoy! The song was over, and the crowds were screaming. Omar took a bow, sweeping his one free hand in front of him, but then stopped short and snapped his head in Angel's direction upon the realization that she was not bowing with him. \"Angel?\" he stood up hesitently, watching her all the while as first she froze stock still, then began to shiver vilently, and dropped as her knees gave out on her. \"Angel!\" Omar caught her as she tried to go down, and pulled her into a sitting position held in his arms. \"Angel, don't do this!\" Omar admonished as he looked her face over for recognition, \"Not now, not after all we went through!\" Shaking her slightly, his face dropped from anger to intense sorrow as Angel failed to respond. Her eyes were closed, her face expressionless. \"Angel...\" Omar moved to bury his face in her chest to hide his forth coming tears when... she let out a giggle. \"Huh?\" Luckily Dizzy had made his way over and was checking her pulse and pupil dilation as Angel began to chuckle loudly. \"It must be whatever he had her doped up on,\" Dizzy reasoned, \"The addrenalin that kicked in when that- that thing showed up must have damped the usual effects for a bit, but now the drugs are kicking back in full force.\" \"She gonna be ok?\" Stretch asked as he came up behind them. \"She should be fine after awhile,\" Dizzy assured him. Omar scowled, his gaze still on Angel's face as she heaved a sigh and seemingly conked out. \"Not enough that slime-ball got us all doped up, had to slam Angel with drugs too, his STAR. I swear, if he wasn't already dead, I'd be tearing him to pieces,\" he growled out angrily. \"I'd be joining you,\" Dizzy assured him. \"But guys,\" Stretch pointed out as he stood behind them, \"Mr. Mok isn't dead. He went to another dimension.\" \"Hah!\" Omar laughed, \"You honestly think he survived ten seconds in there? Mok man's history, and good riddance. I never liked his style anyway. Come on,\" he said, standing up, Angel in his arms. \"Let's get Angel someplace to ride this out.\" Angel snorted. \"Some place to ride this out...\" she repeated faintly, her eyes still closed. Dizzy and Stretch looked at each other in concern while Omar gave Angel a surprised glance. \"Good idea,\" Dizzy agreed. \"Come on, we'll bunk at my place,\" he offered, leading the group of stage. \"Thanks,\" Omar said as he shifted Angel to keep her from slipping. \"Hey Dizzy?\" Stretch asked as he caught up with the pudgy teen, \"You got root beer?\" Omar shook his head as he trailed behind the two of them, Angel's weight slowing him down some as he kept up a determined pace. He felt Angel shift herself in his arms, and he looked down to find her rousing herself a bit. \"Omar?\" she asked drowsily, her eyes barley fluttering open before closing again. \"Hey, Angel,\" he said, \"Don't worry, I got ya.\" \"We won, right?\" she asked, just as drowsily. Omar smirked, knowing he was going to have to answer this again tomorrow when the drugs were out of her system. \"Yeah Angel, we beat em' good.\" \"Mok's not here, is he?\" Omar's smirk dropped as he looked ahead once more. \"No.\" He answered in dead seriousness, not able to say much else at the moment. The vision of Angel clinging to the slime-ball and giggling like a maniac was still fresh in his mind. He knew either he'd been on something at the time, or possibly she had, but it still... hurt. \"Good,\" Angel answered, surprising Omar and snapping him out of his moody countenance as he looked down at her with a puzzled expression. She hmmed to herself and snuggled into his chest like a child. \"He was crazy,\" she said simply, and Omar, still surprised by her actions, couldn't help but agree with her. \"Guy was a psychopath,\" he added to her assessment. Angel hmmed to herself once more as she pulled her self closer to Omar's warmth, then gave a small yawn. \"I love you Omar,\" she said simply before drifting off, the way a kid does before going to bed. Omar's face softened as he slowly drifted to a halt, his eyes still glued to her sleeping form. He knew it was just the drugs talking, but... \"Me too Angel,\" he answered back almost too soft to hear. \"Yo Omar!\" Omar was brought back to reality by a call from Stretch, \"You coming?\" \"I'm coming,\" he called as he started forth once more, heading for a car Dizzy had somehow managed to procure. \"I think she's asleep,\" he muttered as he climbed into the back with her, Stretch closing the door behind them and hopping into the front seat with Dizzy. Dizzy checked his rear view mirror as he started the engine, catching Omar still holding Angel carefully in the back seat. \"Don't worry,\" he assured his friend, \"Angel will be ok. We'll fix her up.\" The group drove off into the night, one very comfortable Omar with a beautiful young female nuzzled into his chest riding in the backseat. Awwww!!! Sweetness! Anyway, there wasn't much to this fic other then cute Omar and Angel fluff, though I do hope I managed to get Omar's tone down. Too many fluff fics these days completely disregard what the male character is normally like, so I'm rather hoping I didn't do that myself. In case your confused, yes, at the end of the movie, Angel did come out of her dug stupor to save the day, I just chose to chalk that up to addrenaline. So, naturally, once the addrenaline wore off, she'd be acting a little funny.... So, I hoped you liked, and please, do take the time to review if you get a chance.

Lady of Myth and Legends here! I saw this movie on youtube and couldn't resist writing a Fanfic about it. I must say, it broke my heart , made me laugh, made me cry, and then mended my heart together again. This one scene in question is the one that broke my heart, but (those who have seen the movie) we know the true outcome. Disclaimer: I'm sorry to say, I do NOT own Rock & Rule or any of its characters. I also wish to thank my reviewer (what? Only one?) for her praise and support: Vicky: \"Hey! I loved this! I watched Rock & Rule a while ago... but I can't find many fanfiction.\" \"Talking\" ' Thinking' From the moment that he stepped into the place, he knew. Something wasn't right. \"Angel?\" He called, his voice breaking. Damn. Yeah, that was confident. He could barely make out shapes in the dark. It was so dark, almost black. 'Were is she? I have to find her!' Tension and apprehension filled him. He felt an ice cold shiver run up his spine. She was here, somewhere. But, where? He scanned the room, looking for any sign of her. Nothing. No one was up here. He continued forward, searching. She had to be there somewhere. He walked into another room, this one just as black as the other. But the feeling, that ice cold feeling, had crawled from his back had moved to his stomach. CLANG! His eyes fileted in the direction of the sound. A piece of metal swung back and forth. Someone must have hit it. He scanned the rest of the room, nothing. \"Omar! This is a surprise.\" He stumbled backwards a few paces. Mok's face came out of nowhere, the sudden appearance of the man's face startled him. 'Well, the guy wasn't much to look at in the first place.' He though to himself as he regained his composure. \"What a pleasant and . . unexpected surprise.\" Mok continued, ignoring his startled response. \"Hi big O. How's it going?\" Her voice, it was much too high. Omar didn't want to believe it. Angel. His Angel, was leaning against Mok, her hand resting on his chest. She smiled coyly at him and he felt his heart sink. No. All this time, he thought she loved him. 'Was it all a lie? Was she toying with him the whole time? Was none of it real?' She laughed. A cold, empty laugh. This . . it couldn't be . . Angel? His Angel? No. Her voice wasn't that high, it didn't contain that hollow, that empty resonance. This wasn't Angel. 'But it has to be.' The voice in his head pressured. It looked like her, to the very last detail. His heart felt like it was shattering into a million pieces. Hot, white pain seared through his veins, reaching into every corner, every turn of him. It burned. Burned like nothing he had ever felt before. He wanted to run. Run away and never look back. \"Perhaps we should invite him to warm up for a spell.\" Mok laughed and sneered at him. Angel joined him, her voice no longer that sweet sound that warmed his very being. Mok and this . . . thing . . . their echoing laughter spread through out his mind. No. This wasn't Angel. Not the Angel he knew. The Angel he knew was kind, fair, a little stubborn (he never cared), and her laugh was like the sound of a triangle when someone gives it a light tap. This. . . Thing, wasn't his Angel. Not the girl he had fallen for. Not the girl that had scared him out of his mind with worry. No. Nooooo! This couldn't be. His Angel was gone. Well? Short I know , but hey even in the movie it was short. I just thought that this little ficlet would be cool to do. You know, to see what it was like from Omar's POV. Please R & R. Thank you.

Tall mountains decorated with pine trees reach the cloudless blue skies, against the beautiful, flower-filled prairies with wild grass that flows in the wind. Life in this state is peaceful & quiet, barely touched by civilization except in the cities. One of them, Ohmtown, is where our story begins. It was a sunny afternoon in 3010. Amidst the little traffic in the quiet city, a white car made its way down the streets. In the driver's seat, a young girl of 16 was at the wheel, her long golden hair flowing in the wind. Clad in a simple white dress, the girl had soft peach fur & beautiful blue eyes that matched the color of the skies. A smile was on her cherubic face as she drove up to a ratty old building. Once she had gotten to her destination, the girl got out of her car, & made her way inside the building. Things were awfully quiet in the main room of Mylar's Restaurant & Nightclub. On the stage, against a blue background with large orange stripes, four teenagers were busy practicing their instruments. One of them was around 19 years old, & his name was Omar. With a shock of wild red hair that mostly fell down to his shoulders, he scatted quite harshly as he strummed his loud guitar.

ChapternOne: Where to begin? \"Stupidnpiece of… work, God damn it!\" Omar Quaalude [1] snarled as hensmacked the offending laptop in front of him. The thing never workednwhen he wanted it to; it seemed like it acted up to deliberately tonmock him, to remind him that he wasn't as young as he once was. Atnthe age of forty, Omar knew that he was still fairly young. In thenworld that he lived in, it was a completely different story. Hisnworld was compiled of fierce competitiveness, of obsessive fans thatnwould declare themselves as being his soul mate, of people just wentnto his concerts just to scream obscenities at him, where every movenhe made was closely scrutinized by the tabloids and the people whichnread them, he was considered to be almost past his prime. Justnthinking about it made him feel quite older than his years. Henthought back throughout the entirety of his career: Angel'snunplanned pregnancy of their eldest child so early in their career,nthe annoying tabloids that didn't understand the meaning of 'Notninterested' (Jessica Snow especially. She downright pissed himnoff). The few times he had been sent to jail. The near falling out henhad with the band. And then… Andnthen, there was him. Thenman who followed them for years without anyone's knowledge, the onenwho hid in the shadows, watching, monitoring Angel's, his Angel's,nevery move. Thenlaptop's fan turned on, signaling that it decided to end itsntorment and let him do as he planned. \"Yes!nThank you, oh Great One,\" Omar mockingly bowed down to the cheapnmachine in front of him. Openingnup the word program he had installed, his fingers were poised, readynto start the task that lay ahead of him. He started to think of whatnhe was to say, of how to address the people who would be buying this,nof how he was to be honored that fans actually still gave a damnnabout him, both then and now. \"Shit,\"nOmar muttered; nothing came to mind. Absolutely nothing. He had nonidea how to start this thing. \"Daddy?\"nA whisper. Omarnlooked over his shoulder to his youngest child. She stood in thendining room entrance, a small little girl of five years in hernnightie. He smiled inwardly to himself; she was very striking innresemblance to Angel. The only noticeable difference was that of hernhair. She didn't have her mother's platinum locks, or Omar'snown flaming red hair; instead, she was in between, a strawberrynblonde. \"Whatnare you doing up? It's after one, Lexi\" he gently chided hisnyoungest. \"There'sna monster under my bed,\" Alexia replied, her tone, nervous andnsoft. \"He's big, an' scary', an' he smells bad.\" \"Oh,nreally?\" Omar questioned, appearing quite interested and concernednin his daughters' plight. A voice in the back of his head said:n\"Kid probably shoved some peanut butter sandwiches under the bednand forgot about them.\" \"CannI sleep with you and Mommy tonight?\" She pleaded, her eyes carryingnthe wounded puppy look. Hennodded his head in agreement; with the birth of his eldest child, henhad started to \"grow soft\" as Dizzy had said, jokingly, Stretchnlaughing in agreement. Turningnthe laptop off, he left his space in the dining room to follow hisndaughter to his and Angel's bedroom. Passing the first bedroomnafter the stairs, he looked in. Teal wasn't home yet. There wasngoing to be serious hell to pay when she got home. GentlynOmar opened the door to the master bedroom. All that could be heardnwas the soft, gentle breathing of Angel, mixed in with the faintnsound of traffic. Alexiancrawled into the bed, Omar following suit. He pulled the sheets overnthem, his daughter snuggling up to both parents. Afterna couple of minutes of asking for a drink, and Alexia's favoritenstuffed human [2] and rabbit, she fell asleep. Omarncouldn't sleep. Not if he wanted to. He had no idea of what to saynin his introduction, and it bothered him greatly. On most occasions,nhe could come up with anything without trying. But this was annentirely different matter. It would show the world that he's likenthe rest of the people out there. Hensighed and rolled onto his side, gazing at his daughter. She appearednuntouchable, lost in her childish fantasies and fears and innocence… Inspirationnstruck. Omarnsat up. He knew what to start his story with: his childhood. Henthought back to his earliest memories; of his father, the crazy,nseemingly bipolar man. His mother, the kind, gentle woman. And hisnbrother, the one to never back down from a fight, who had died in anmotorcycle accident shortly after Omar had entered junior high. Thisnwas the medium Omar was to start with; childhood. Everyone has fondnmemories, memories that they don't like to think about. (Besides,nevery biography he had fallen asleep while reading started with theirnchildhood… he was off to a good start.) Omarngot out of bed and headed back towards the laptop left in the diningnroom. He knew exactly where to start: the working of his family. ______________________________________________________________________________ Short,nI know. But I feel that writing more than this into one chapter wouldnnot work so well. Updates will not be frequent; with school,nmidterms, and work, there is not enough time in the week to do toonmuch. But I'll try to write it in bits and pieces. [1]nThis is a reference as to when Omar, Dizzy and Stretch attempted tonenter Nuke York when they encountered the guard. Omar refers tonhimself as Chief Inspector Quaalude, so I'm assuming that it'snhis last name… Or Goodchild, if you take into account the gagnartwork in which an artist claimed that Omar was based off of. [2]nThis thought sort of occurred to me randomly. Children have favoritenstuffed animals, but in their world, with everyone being eithernanthromorphic or mutants, what would they have? What would childrennlike to sleep with? So, I came up with the idea that instead ofnstuffed animals, there would be stuffed humans. But I decided to keepnstuffed animals as well. Writingnas Omar I find is rather interesting, yet somewhat of a challenge. Inkinda have the feeling that my portrayal of him is somewhat accurate,nbut I feel that his personality reflects mine more than his. As thenstory progresses, I hope to have it sounding more like him. Namingnthe children was a bit of an ordeal. I knew what I wanted to name theneldest child, Teal, almost instantly. It's a name that is notncommon, and to me, it sounds unique and sort of different, such asnOmar's is. Coming up with Alexia's name was a bit trying. Inwanted a variation of a name that could be shortened into a commonnname. Eventually, I fell upon Alexia, and decided to use it.[Chapter 2] After a long delay,nI finally get back to the story! Sorry, folks. For reasons as to whynit took awhile, please read the author's note at the bottom. Disclaimer: I own nonone, except for Allexia, Teal, and any other random character notnincluded in the movie. Chapter Two: FamilynHistory I guess you couldnsay that I was unexpected. My brother, Jason, was an only child fornabout fourteen years. My mom had already got rid of all the babynparaphernalia, given to friends, family, and neighbors. There was nonneed to keep any of it. Mom was almost forty at this point, and mynfather was well into his fifties. The house they owned hadntwo-bedrooms, one story. Perfect for a family of three. And then I camenalong. I came into the world on April 3, 2164. Depending on who yountalked to, I was one of many things: A mistake according to the oldnman, unexpected to my mom, and, depending on how Jason was feeling, Inwas either one of the greatest or worst things that had ever happenednto him. Makes me feel kinda special. Omar stoppedntyping. His mind was at a blank. He read and reread what he hadnwritten. It was kinda iffy, but he would come back to it later. Henfigured that he should maybe start with his parents' history. In the years beforenmy parents would meet and get married, their lives were the completenopposites. My mother, LindanRothenberg, was the middle child, and only daughter in a familynconsisting of a working father, a homemaker mother, and threenperfect, beautiful children. The middle-class family. Also known asnthe 'American Dream' family, a term from when humans still roamednthe Earth. The oldest child, Ray, was on the school football team,nand was heading straight to college on a sports scholarship. Thenyoungest child, Michael, was not athletic like Ray. Rather, he wasnintelligent, and sensitive. Another planned success in the family. And then middlenchild, Linda. The girl who went to church every Sunday, and dreamednof becoming a nurse. After graduating high school, she continued ontoncollege, where she became a nurse. She was fresh out of college whennthe war broke out. Since Michael wasnstarting in high school when the war started, he was exempted due tonhis age. Ray, however, was done with his school career, and wasnconscripted, leaving behind a wife and kid as he was shipped to thennavy. Linda, feeling that as a nurse, it was her duty to help out innany way possible. She was assigned to work in the psychiatric ward innOhmtown. It would be in thisnward that she would meet my father, Daniel. Daniel Quaalude wasnthe youngest child of four before his mother died. His mother hadndied when he was learning to walk, and so, the four kids were leftnwith a father who was barely home. Daniel wouldncomplete his entire school career with low grades and no ambitions,nand would come to work at the local power plant for minimum wage. When the war brokenout, Daniel hadn't been conscripted into the army. Rather, henjoined on his free will. It had benefits, good money, and a decentnpension plan. Already in the army was his best friend from school,nJason. Daniel was finenrunning up to his balls in mud, shooting at people, hiding inntrenches, and getting only few hours of sleep at night. It wasn'tnuntil Jason stepped on a mine and exploded all over Daniel when henwasn't. He was sent to thenpsychiatric ward, having received an honorable discharge for hisnservices for his country. At the hospital, there was one particularnnurse that caught his eye. A pretty brunette, she also found Danielnto be quite handsome himself. Upon his release, Daniel and Lindandated for seven months before Daniel met her parents. Linda's parentsnwere against her marrying Daniel. She was barely twenty three yearsnold, they argued, while Daniel was thirty nine. Her parents wouldn'tnadmit until much later to the fact that they didn't want any one ofntheir children marrying someone who had any problems of any sort.nThey felt it would lower their social status immensely. Unknown to Linda'snparents, she was well into an interesting predicament. So, onnSeptember 20, 2149, Linda Rothenberg became Linda Quaalude, and onnFebruary 11, 2150, Jason Ray Quaalude was born. *~*~*~*~*~ Omar stretched hisnarms and yawned. He looked up at the clock. 2:37 a.m. He had anninterview at 9:00 a.m. Sharp. \"Christ,\" henmuttered. He had forgotten about it. He was going to be tiredntomorrow. Sighing, he made hisnway up to bed. Again, he stopped in front of Teal's room, andnlooked in. The girl was in bed, apparently sleeping. The bedroomnwindow was open. It hadn't been before. \" Probably heardnme come upstairs.\" He headed into hisnbedroom, mentally noting that he would talk with her tomorrow. Lexinwas sprawled out on his side of the bed, sheets kicked off, nightientwisted up. Angel hadn't been disturbed in any way. Not feelingnparticularly interested in waking up a potentially grouchynfive-year-old, Omar resigned himself to the edge of the bed. Itnwasn't too bad. It was better than the floor at any time. TBC… A/N: Well, here'snchapter two. Short. But maybe I'll come back to it and work on it.nMake it sound less typical. This chapter two wasnone of three that I had penned out. The original one I wasngoing to use was lost (flash drive destroyed the file), so I presentnyou chapter two, version 2. The third file I might use as a laternchapter. It took awhile fornme to get it out, I know. With school, studying, graduation, and workncoming first, I didn't have much spare time to work on this. Thank you for beingnpatient with me. With summer vacation coming up, and depending on mynwork schedule, maybe, just maybe, I'll be getting somenchapters out faster. ","Summary":" Disclaimer:nI own nada; I own only those who you do not recognize. ChapternOne: Where to begin? \"S"},{"Movie":"Rock and Rule","Title":"Redemption 100","Author":"Kewl Veloci","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4921500","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The thick night air was without silence that night in the slightly populated area of Central Ohmtown; the claps of thunder from an approaching thunderstorm as well as the pulsating sounds of a powerful musical machine upon a flying, bat-winged saucer cut the air like a knife through flesh. No one within the enormously populated arena of the Ohmtown Power Plant truly feared the saucer though, nor did they fear the strange, ominous figure which stood upon it. The figure was a person they all knew very well… It was a male creature, very tall and thin, and despite being of older age, it was easy to tell the man had toned muscles upon his long arms and upper chest area. Upon closer inspection, it would also seem he were the melding of a cat and a hairless rat, with front-facing eyes (hidden by a pair of fancy sunglasses), a small, pointed nose, pinkish-pale skin, and wide pointed ears which looked like impious horns at the sides of his head. And every once in a while, the ferocious side of the feline would show in the man whenever he spoke or sang, revealing the four long, white fangs set within a powerful jaw. But perhaps the most striking characteristic of this ominous person was not the crazy, Glam rock fashion outfit he wore or the fact that he was completely bald, but it was his prominent, glossy lips. No other anthro-animal life form in that theater, no matter what gender or amount of plastic surgeries, could ever achieve the full, attractiveness of those famous lips. So much were this man's lips the attraction of a million female fans as well as the bane of the other males whose women had left them. But as incredibly handsome as they were, these lips… which for so many years spoke courteously and sang so beautifully… were now only spewing out the vile words of hate, death, wrath, and bloody vengeance… As the crowds upon crowds cheered and gathered noise for the man standing upon the hovering, bat-like stage, the star of the show brought his large hands to the color-lighted touch pads of the large musical machine in front of him. A he placed his gloved palm to one touch pad, an almost eerie sounding keyboard note would sound off into the night atmosphere; each colored touch pad had its own tone, sound and frequency. And together with his incredible talent for mending sounds together, the mysterious man in the wild neon-orange outfit began to play the notes to his liking, and a song came into form. The song was called \"The Invocation Song\". Along with the long sounds of an invisible keyboard, the machine could also produce the hard taps of a drum set and the ever popular guitar strums, all of which the musician almost effortlessly brought together in his song. The \"Invocation Song\" itself was at first very creepy sounding, but that was how the crowds loved it, and once you became hooked onto the steady beat of the song, it was hard not to like it. Below and a few yards away from the mysterious musician and his magical hovering bat stage was a great metal structure of a dragon's gaping, tooth-filled mouth. Within the dragon's mouth was a powerful circuit board with metal restraining attachments… and trapped within those torturous devices was a rather beautiful mouse woman by the name of Angel… As the crowds continued to watch the show, very entertained indeed, and the Glam-clan musician continued to play the strange song, the circuit board behind the woman (dressed in a very skimpy cloth outfit) began to hum with raw electrical power. Above the whole scene, the large-lipped male creature wearing the fancy sunglasses observed the happening below, mostly the girl, and a sneer came upon his very slightly wrinkled face; he then looked to his control panel of his machine, and gently glided his large hand across the touch pads, causing them all to glow. Then he brought his gloved hand to a separate control section and squeezed his long, bony fingers together, as if he were holding an invisible item. Down below, the lights upon the restraining collar around the girl's neck glowed brightly, and she suddenly burst forth into a form of resonation that was hard to describe: \" Say just why you offer (us) 3D-D, (What was) tetra flawlessly, Active matrix (tireless) (all) become, Ohohoooooooooooooo!\" What did these strange lyrics mean? Was the audience supposed to sing along? Because for all they knew, this was a brand new song by their favorite rock star, one which they never heard before until now, and one they automatically loved! They cheered! Some were practically jumping out of their seats, but they just didn't give their own rodent rears weather people were going crazy out of their wits over one unheard song. This kind of reaction was nothing compared to what insanity normally went down at a Mok Concert… Yes… everything is going according to my plan. Soon, these ungrateful vermin who dare call themselves my \"fans\" shall know true fear … Mok smiled down at the happenings before him: the lights, the sounds, the echoes; the crazy audience, the trapped and helpless Angel successfully singing the very words of the Summoning. The words which Mok himself had his troubles with deciphering once his supercomputer managed to track them down. Though Mok had known these lyrical demonic chants for a long time: The one whom his fans called \"The Magic Man\", Mok had always had a well hidden but strong interest in the Satanic cult (if you could call it that). Mok's collection of the occult paraphernalia started when he was around 17; it mostly came from listening to the songs of his favorite rock groups as a young boy way back in the day. Back then it was much more difficult to get away with a hobby like that, but luckily for the 48-year-old Mok, prudence and conservativeness had all quickly disappeared after the Great Hurricane Aras, which hit Ohmtown and the surrounding areas of April '67. Although everything he could dig up on his own was only meant for study in his childhood, it soon grew into a dangerous obsession as Mok got older; he began to test the limits of the occult's \"magic\" and his own \"magic\" as he saw it, even going as far as to pilot a powerful piece of aircraft at the tender age of 18 and nearly getting himself killed. For a while, he was too shaken up to tamper with that Satanic nonsense again, all the while his popularity and powers over the public grew and grew with each passing day, month, and even year. Then it happened again. His care-free and charming mind was once again under the influence of the dangerous Dark paraphernalia; Mok began to incorporate the Devil more and more into his songs and performances, the many magical tricks he perform becoming all the more dangerous, and it continued to stretch out over the many years of his fame. But the question is, why now? Why was The Great Musical Icon of The World Mok back to the same irrational beliefs/actions/thinking that nearly got himself killed so many years ago? For Mok, the answer was simple: These \"fans\" as they call themselves… look at them all, the pigs…they have come only to make a ridicule of my name, to gaze up at my wonder only to look aback and jeer at my age and loss of youthful glow… But not anymore…this plan (MY PLAN!) shall make them pay… they will scorn the day they deserted me! I am Mok! And I shall be king... Still busily working the musical machine in front of him, Mok gazed out into the glowing red, laser-beam star which had risen from the stage floor and out through the glass roof of the Ohmtown Power Plant. The storm outside was now raging more then ever, and Mok had a hunch that it had nothing to do with the polluted atmosphere… There was a terrible rumble and the sound of glass breaking all 'round the arena… out of the bright light of the towering laser star there shot up the pulsating, fiery entities of skulls and flames; hundreds, maybe even thousands of them, all gathering nearly forty feet into the air, and meshing together to form a giant demonic form. It was a creature so horrific and unheard of before, that it could only be described by one person with one word: evil. \"…I don't know what it is, Stretch… but whatever it is… its evil .\" All the jittery rat guy and plump mole man could do was watch helplessly as the \"evil thing\" began a horrific rampage among the thousands of trapped Mok fans still in the stands… Mok himself, the star of this whole event, looked upon the thing which he had always considered \"his\" beast: the way the monster's body was covered from its spiked head to its demon tail with pulsating fire red veins, almost like a giant brain, and the creature's slimy texture and the raging muscles of its chest and arms, which ended in bony, hooked claws which it swung in the air in a very Godzilla-like fashion. Mok removed his fancy sunglasses and took a moment to stare at this, his great hell-born creation, with all the admiration you could imagine. Soon, terrible, evil thoughts began to circulate inside his bald head: all the things he could now accomplish with this Beast under his wing: all the disrespectful, deserting fans he could now slaughter! Yes… Mok thought devilishly to himself as a crazy smile came upon his face… after all the months I spent on this project, searching for the perfect voice… I have finally done it! Yes! My beast! My VENGANCE! And finally, these wicked, heartless thoughts flowed down and out of his now less-sane brain and though his mouth like a pipe full of Nuke York sewage. Mok the Magic Man stood from his seat, triumphantly stretched out his long arms and wrenching the air with his feline-claws; he threw back his head and shouted sanctimoniously, \" MY VENGANCE! DESTROY THEM ALL! HA HA HA HA HA!\" And that is just what the Beast proceeded to do… Toad frantically scrambled to make his way down from his operation's tower as fast as his roller skates could take him. The huge, burly dog-man had just witnessed the one thing that he never wanted to see in his whole life: his youngest sibling, his brother Zip, had just been assaulted by Mok's Beast. Toad came upon the scene and knelt down upon the cold, metal stage where his poor little brother lay beaten. Toad took Zip into his huge arms and held his head in his large hand. \"Aw, Zip! \" He said, trying to hold back the tears that had already begun to form in his eyes. \"Whatdidja do it for?\" The young, child-like Zip opened his eyes and spoke, his words labored and his eyes \"(Cough) …I did it… for Uncle Mikey… (cough)… and for us…\" When he had managed to finish this sentence, Zip placed his hand gently to his big brother's cheek and looked into him with his soft eyes. That was when Toad finally gave up his fight with his tears; he could feel the tears on his right side siding down the crevice of the deep, white scar under his right eye. Zip spoke: \"(Cough)… Toad (sob)… we ain't evil… are we?\" Toad simply didn't know how to answer that question. He often pondered it himself in the past, as his association with The Magic Man often forced him to do some very dirty deeds, most of which he'd be deeply ashamed to tell his own mother about. Toad sniffled and tried to resume his position as responsible oldest brother, despite his absence of a proper answer: \"Don't talk now, Zip…\" Toad tried to calm his little brother down by cradling him. Suddenly, Zip went limp. \"Zip?\" Nothing. \"ZIP! TALK TO ME!\" But no sound came from the one-eared pup, not a sound. Toad felt his whole world fall apart around him, and he buried his head in Zip's chest, weeping hard but silently. Toad wanted it all to end; he wanted all of this to be just a bad dream… a dream which he would be waking up from soon to yet another miserable day he'd have to spend waiting on hand and foot to the spoiled, arrogant rock star, Mok… And speaking of Mok, did he care about what happened? Did he even care to shed a single tear for what happened to Toad's innocent little brother? Did he even bother to take notice of this sudden tragedy? Hell no. Why, the Great \"Magic Man\" himself was too busy laughing his bald head off at all the blood being shed down below him. Laughing like a maniacal mad scientist whose experiment has been purposely turned loose upon an unsuspecting public… The fury that would come to boil up deep inside Toad as a result of his pain and suffering was frightening and indescribable… Observing all the chaos and carnage that was happening down below him from his high perch upon his hovering bat-wing stage, Mok the superior rocker had taken a rather precarious seat at the edge of the stage; his long, slender legs were crossed casually with the white leather of his high-heel go-go boots shining with each flash of lightning in the windows. Every so often, Mok would rub his chin with his long fingers as he focused on one or two individual fans, slight concern growing on him as it looked as though they might have found a chance to escape, only to be swallowed whole or trampled by the Beast; as hundreds of more dog, cat, and rat people would come to meet this same terrible fate, Mok's great lips would stretch into a truly wicked smile and his black heart would be filled with impish glee. Yes… that's it…scream, scream as loud as you can…for it tickles Mok to his bone to hear your pain and suffering… Mok would think to himself with a deep chuckle. In fact, he was enjoying himself so much that the rock star barely gave any notice to the girl, Angel, who was now free from her entrapment upon the circuit board, thanks to the surprise entrance of Omar. It was only when the sharp-eyed Mok noticed his Demon-Beast becoming distracted from demolishing a concession stand, and turned its huge, throbbing head around to look at something. What was it looking at? Mok leaned slightly over to look beneath his hovering stage: there stood Angel, now with torn clothes and collar-less, the blonde mouse woman had her mouth open, but Mok could not make out a single word of it over all the commotion around him. Then he heard the echoes… \" Oh what will the signal be… For your eyes to see me?\" Mok frowned for a moment, scratching his chin as he eyed Angle curiously until it hit him: Ahhh! I see… (Deep giggle) She is actually trying to send the beast back! My, such a clever girl… Mok sat back in his seat and tried to contain his amusement; the Beast itself had now fully approached Angel, easily dwarfing her by about one-hundred-and-fifty feet. For a moment, the terrible Beast just stood there, staring at Angel with surprisingly innocent curiosity, even tilting its giant head like a puppy would; but this moment of calm was short lived as the creature's neon-blue eyes began to glow brightly and it emitted a deep growl. From out its body, the Beast produced an array of new, separate heads, each with their own glowing blue eyes, and mouths set with long fangs. Angel sang the next verse to her song, showing no fear even as the snapping, threatening mouths inched closer to her barely covered soft body… In the next two minutes, Mok would find himself looking out into the open arena with a look of pure disbelief and terror in his long-lashed eyes: the Beast was going away! It shrank into its original form of swirling fiery entities and recoiling back into the glowing hellhole which it had once sprung from. Mok found himself beginning to shake with anger and fear, for the very thing that would set him for the rest of his life and make him infinity in the universe was now leaving him! \"No, no, NO!\" Mok shouted out loud as he quickly jumped back into his position at his magical music machine and began hitting all the buttons to his Invocation Song, but nothing seemed to be working: the Beast's red flames had begun to die off in the pit. \" They can't stop you!\" Mok shouted down at the Beast as it continued to dematerialize and Mok continued to slam his large palms into the lighted pillars around him. \"Destroy… them…ALL!\" But when the Magic Man looked back down over the ledge, he could no longer see the red glowing entities of the Beast, for it had now completely vanished into the Dimension's vortex, which was now itself shrinking! Mok's mind was racing now as he resorted to blindly slamming his fists into the pillars, causing many of them to break. Instead of ordering, Mok was now left to outright begging, \"Don't go! Please…don't… GO!\" Eventually though, the rage and frustration inside Mok Swagger became too much, and he began to sputter a series of incoherent rants whist pounding his large fists into his machine, while the audience continued to run around in circles and lightning continued to flash outside the Power Plant glass. When the last flash of lightning had dissipated, Mok suddenly noticed a large, dark shadow was now covering him in an ominous fashion. Having also sensed a growl, Mok turned around… and is heart nearly skipped a beat. There was Toad. The massive bulldog stood looming above his \"Boss\" with his dull teeth bared and a look of blind murder in his small eyes. The huge man came even closer, trapping the skinny Mok against his broken machine; Mok's eyes were wide with fight and he was shaking. Toad finally spoke as he reached his thick, burly arms out to grapple his former Boss, \" My brother's DEAD.\" Feeling the sheer power of Toad's huge hands grappling him, Mok found himself bursting into tears, black tears colored by his mascara and shed for his pure panic. But, even in tears and physically at the mercy of his henchman, Mok's inflated pride still shone through: \" YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!\" Mok's thin body was easily lifted high over Toad's head; the cold air whipped around the musician's skimpy dressed body and his heart was beating hard. As the thunder rolled, Mok's mind became erased of all common sense; the only thing that mattered now was that they knew his name… \" I AM MOK!\" Toad threw him over the edge. Mok's following scream was loud and piercing, sounding like the combined screeches of a cat and a rat. The butterflies in his stomach spread wildly to the rest of is body as Mok plummeted down the thirty+ feet, his mind spinning as his body tumbled. He could still feel the thousands of eyes watching him in the fall… Scratch! Mok had just managed to catch the wall of the dimension with his claws, thanks to his cat ancestry; he exerted a lot of his strength just to reach his hand upon the ledge in a hopeless attempt to pull himself out. It just couldn't be: how could it end for him like this? He was The Magic Man! He should be the one with all the control of the universe! His mind spoke out loud as he screamed out, \" The magic of One Voice…\" Mok gripped the edge so hard trying to pull himself out that he felt his long bony fingers were going to break, but he was growing weak… \"… One Heart…\" With the tears still running from his eyes, Mok felt the panic rush over him as he felt the Portal pulling him in… \"… One Song!\" He could not believe it. How could it be true? How could it happen like this? Through his tears, Mok looked up at the shrinking hole above him… and the world of existence it carried away with it… The greatest icon in music history was being sucked right out of the only world that ever gave him that title… the one world he tried to make his own, despite what its done for him… but how could it end this way? How could his supercomputer have given him false information? And how in hell were those infernal brats able to send it back?! No ONE could send it back! \" But…there…is…no…ONE!\" Mok's voice echoed into infinity as he finally slipped and went into a free-fall once again, the hole to his world closed up above him, and total darkness encased him as the rock-god's body went cold…[Chapter 2] Darkness still prevailed within The Magic Man's vision; it had been this way for what seemed an eternity throughout the great fall, and now without light, it was impossible to tell if it was day or night… The feeling of pain and soreness returned to his body, robbing Mok Swagger of all the possibility that he might be dead. His body was protesting against a feeling of itchiness being pressed upon his entire left side, as well as the chills of a bitter wind passing over him. The last thing to return to him was his vision; the pitch black color under his eyelids had now faded to a mellow orange, which is what you normally wake up to in the mornings if facing an open window. For a moment, Mok was afraid to open his eyes, afraid of what he would find considering that his memory was still in full tact. But as his pointed, cat-like ears returned to their proper positions at the sides of his head, Mok's curiosity eventually became too much when strange unearthly noises reached them from all around him. He opened his eyes. The first thing that met his brain receptors was three red-colored blades of what Mok guessed was grass; ever so slowly, Mok lifted his head an inch off the strange ground he was lying upon to fully observe where exactly he was. Though, the word \"exactly\" had become more of an overstated word once Mok got a good view of his surroundings: The legendary rocker found himself lying in a field, an endless field of dead-looking orange-red \"grass\"; the valley was hilly, rolling along like the waves of a suddenly petrified sea of some sort. Mok's tall, lanky body was in a crumpled heap, with his long arms and very long legs lying out like a wooden dummy's would. He had quite a few scratches, scuffs, and bruises on his body, and his [slightly effeminate] neon orange Glam outfit had small tears in some places. Mok finally sat himself up in a sitting position, sore, and briefly looked over his hands: the white glove on his left hand was shredded around the fingers and bits of it were handing off from where it had been torn due to Mok trying to hold on to the lip of the Vortex. He looked down ay his tight, high-heel go-go boots but found they were still in tact. Hmph…good. He thought to himself, At least I won't have to purchase a new pair of those… Mok looked up and squinted his eyes; he was just able to make out what looked like a mountain range far off in the distance. Mok heard a rumble and turned his head sideways to stare up into the sky, which was a deep maroon in the surrounding areas, but thirty feet right above him was what looked like a huge black hole . What the…dear God! A sudden jolt of fear singed him as The Magic Man stumbled to his feet, his \"precious\" high-heel boots not helping. He trotted backwards a few feet until he was out from under the wide black hole and stood away from it, all the while staring up at it with wide eyes. It didn't take long for Mok to study the empty blackness to decide he must have fallen from it. Then Mok remembered something. He reached into a small pocket inside his performance outfit and pulled out a ring that looked like it had a computer chip attached: it was the same ring his supercomputer designed for him to seek out the special voice needed to raise the Beast. Along with that, Mok was also able to communicate with his computer thought this, which is how he knew where to look when he was on his \"world tour/talent search\". Working the tips of his claws to turn a tiny knob at the side, a light began to blink and there was the sound of fuzz. Then a cool feminine voice came through: \"Greetings. Mok.\" \"Computer! Where am I?\" Mok ordered sternly. \"Tell me where I am located.\" \" Locator activated. Searching now.\" There came very mystical computer sounds from the little ring on Mok's long finger, and a bright light gave a flash as the computer's reading worked. Mok found himself frowning into the small object while tapping the tip of his boot upon the grassy ground in impatience. All the while, Mok's wide, pointed ears twitched every so often to the little noises around him; he was not in a familiar place, and didn't trust his surroundings. However, Mok figured he had just been transported by the Vortex to another part of the States, so the musician figured he could just have his Airship come by and pick him up, albeit that would take some time. There was a beep and the computer's voice spoke: \"Locating complete, Mok. Location identified.\" \"Well? Where the hell am I?\" Mok's scratchy voice said. \"And how soon can you send my Airship to pick me up?\" There was a small moment of silence before the computer answered: \"Airship transport impossible. Location unreachable.\" \" What?!\" Mok barked, his ring hand now in a fist. \"What do you mean \"location unreachable\"?! It can't be that difficult for you to find me in the middle of the States!\" \" The Locator indicates you are not in the United States.\" Mok froze. \"…I'm… not in the country?\" He quickly took off the ring and held it within both hands, his long fingers grasping the object like spider legs. Mok's ears perked forward to listen intently to the computer's voice: \" Location: not in the village of Ohmtown.\" \" Location: not in the state of Nuke York.\" \" Location: not in the country of America.\" \" Location: not in the Western Hemisphere.\" With each passing word of his supercomputer, Mok could feel himself falling apart: his heart began to race, his eyes grew wider and wider, and he began to sweat as his mind caved. \" Location: not on any known continent.\" \" Location: not on any known island.\" \" Location: not on this planet.\" Mok dropped to his knees. \" Location: the other Dimension.\" Mok lost it: \"No… no…NO… NO! You're wrong! This can't be! How could I be in the other Dimension and still be living?!\" The little ring spoke: \"System unable to decipher…\" \" Well, what do I do?!\" Mok yelled into the ring. \" System unable to decipher…\" With a screech, Mok suddenly wrenched the ring off his finger and violently threw it into the ground; he began screaming terrible profanities as he beat the grassy floor with his fists. \" TELL. ME. WHAT. TO. DO! You infernal machine! Don't give me your excuses! I want answers and I want them NOW! You hear me?! ANSWER ME!\" But despite his screaming and threats, the computer's cool voice recited the same answer: \"System unable to decipher.\" By now, Mok's energy was still low from the traumatic time he had back at the Ohmtown Power Plant stadium, and soon he became too tired to beat the ground any long; the Magic Man fell over on his side like a wounded animal and began to cry. Now normally, Mok would have had much better control over himself in times of stress (save his slight verbal abuse against his servants), but because the older creature was still reeling from the long fall through the dimensional hole, and because there was no other souls around, Mok allowed his black tears to run freely over the curvature of his face and onto the dry, prickly grass under him. \"(Sob, sob) ...Gawddammit, computer... Please… please… help me (sob).\" Mok's large lips quivered as he spoke to the little ring lying next to his head. \"… I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go… please, just tell me where I can find an exit (Sob).\" There was a moment of silence (save the chilly winds that rode gently across the red valley) until there was a \"bleep, bleep\" sound, and the supercomputer spoke: \" Other exit located. Go East.\" Mok's pointed cat ears pricked up and he opened his eyes; he immediately grabbed the ring and sat up, eagerly speaking into it: \"East, you say? But I do not know which way is East! Every direction looks just like the last.\" He said as he turned his bald head to look around himself shortly before staring back down in his hands. \" I have now activated the Compass of my systems, Mok. Hold the ring out in front of you and it will guide you.\" The robotic voice spoke. And so Mok got up with a grunt and placed the ring back on his bony middle finger. He held it out in front of himself and turned himself around in a gradual circle; he continued to do this until he could feel the ring vibrating on his finger when he came to face in a certain direction. \"East.\" Mok said out loud to himself with little emotion, just a stern glare as he looked out across the plains and rolling hills until his excellent eyesight met with the long distant mesh of deep twisted foliage: a jungle. And so with a deep breath and then a sigh, the amazing rock star Mok Swagger began walking, keeping his arm out in front of him to allow the ring (and his supercomputer back on his ship) to do their navigational work. He had no idea what he would find in his pathway to home, nor did he know how long it would take him; but whatever was there was to overcome, Mok knew he among all others could do it, he could accomplish anything that anyone put in front of him. He is The Magic Man, after all. The screeching of large tires could scarcely be heard every so often on the long, cracked runways outside the very tall, thick windows of a quiet terminal lounge area. Montana International Airport was normally busy this time of night; it was Saturday at 9:00, Eastern Pacific Time, and the terminals were a buzz with all kinds of business folks and tired vacationers all making their ways around to their rightful flights or outside to waiting taxis (and there weren't very many of those to the outskirts of the small town of Ohmtown, one might add). But a few yards away in a lounge area of the airport, there was a quaint coffee bar to the front and across from that was a roomy, lit area with a few comfy seats with magazines on the tables and TV sets hung upon the iron bars of the windows. The TV's were on low frequency and one of them wasn't even getting reception, but that kind of drawback was common in this mostly poor community. Outside the tall wide windows was mostly nothing but beautiful night sky (the pollution here was not so bad) save for the forms of large aircraft coming upon the runways full of passengers. All of the chairs were empty except for one which was closest to the windows; in this chair sat a woman of very small stature: she looked to be around four feet five inches tall, also quite thin with slightly wrinkled bluish-green skin. The woman wore over herself a black hooded sweater, a pair of dark blue jeans and a pair of girl's sneakers. Her face was the only thing that seemed out of place: it had a clear complexion with bright blond hair and thin eyebrows, which rose slightly every so often whenever she found something interesting in the magazine she was casually reading. After a few minutes of calm silence (save the coffee's bar TV which was playing college football to three patrons), the woman's pointed ears picked up on the approach of someone coming around the corner of the bar to where she sat. But rather then turning her head, she simply waited to see if it was the person she was waiting for; sure enough, a shadow was cast over her from behind, and so with her eyes still to her reading, the small woman spoke. \"I'm guessing the flight must have been a tad behind, Monica. I thought you'd be back sooner.\" The other person named Monica spoke with a shrug, \"Yeah, and the electrical storms we've been getting in Nuke York haven't helped…\" Then Monica came casually over to the first woman's side, finishing her sentence, \"…but it beats taking those mutant-infested trains.\" The little woman in the chair finally looked up from her magazine to the one she had been waiting for: at first glance, it was not hard to tell that Monica was a person of rat decent; her large, round ears and pointed snout were the giveaways. The short fur that covered her was dyed a soft lavender color like most of the young folks those days had it, while her hair was jet black and spiked out at the front. She wore on her long, baggy military pants and a gray shirt with Mok's Satanic goat-head logo on the front. Apart from her curvature as a female rodent, Monica was also rather strong-looking for one as well, with signs of muscle build in her arms and torso as well, though not to such an extent where it would be noticed from even a short distance. Monica spoke, her rodent buck teeth showing through slightly as she did, \"Say Gina, why did you pick that mask to wear? It doesn't match your skin color at all!\" The little woman stood from her chair and abandoned her reading material as she replied, \"Yes, this mask may not match my natural skin coloring very much, but that is why I am wearing this heavy clothing, not just because this airport is freezing. Which reminds me: let's get the hell out of here before those noisy tourists with their brats take up all the taxis in this town.\" And so, Monica followed Gina out of the quiet lounge area and through the rather shabby airport, keeping a stern grip on her luggage. When they eventually made it outside, they were lucky enough to squeeze into an old, rusty taxi which the other crowds seemed to ignore (perhaps for good reason out of fear that it might break down). Monica's combat boot bottoms squeaked on the metal of the cab as she slid in with Gina, who gave the dog-man at the driver's seat money to get them into town. As the taxi pulled away from the large, loud airport, Gina turned to Monica and spoke, \"Well, I'm guessing your trip to visit your sister went well, tuts'?\" \"Ah, yes, very well.\" Monica said with a grin. \"My sister had the nerve to ask if I was still with 'my rock star boyfriend'. Ha! [She's jealous]. But of course I am, and I have to say, I have missed him a ton.\" \"Yes, he has missed you too, very much in fact.\" said Gina. \"Its funny, though,\" Monica said as she gazed out the cab window into the night sky, \"Mok didn't seem to miss me that much when I left…\" The rat-woman's smile faded away. \"Really? How?\" \"Well, normally by time I leave and get halfway to wherever it is I'm going, Mok would call me at least ten times throughout the whole trip. And most of my trips are only short flights away.\" Gina looked away and thought about this. \"You know, Mok has been keeping to himself quite a lot recently… actually, he did mention something about a little 'seclusion time' he was going into, but I never thought Mok would actually go through with it.\" \"Really?!\" Monica laughed as she folded her arms behind her head for a makeshift pillow. \"Mok? In seclusion ? Ha! Mok's never liked being away from his adoring fans! Hell, he doesn't even like to be alone! You know Mok: he just has to be the center of attention, all the time!\" The two women laughed at this. Gina noticed Monica's smile fading again, and so she offered up a good word: \"Ah well… look, tuts',\" (Monica looked jadedly over to her.) \"I may not be able to tell why Mok's been locking himself up the way he has, but there is one thing I can tell you is this: Mok loves ya', girl. He's always loved you very much, just like he loves and cares for all his 'little ladies'. And if there is anything in the world he would kill himself over (besides his music) is you and the others.\" Monica sighed. \"Yeah… I know. But it just seems like he's lost track of his life, ya' know? I mean, all the 'papers in Ohmtown report Mok's never even left his mansion in, what, six months? I'm just afraid of what I'll find when I get to his place…\" Gina opened her mouth to object, but only found herself closing it as she began to imagine all the terrible things that could and have befallen reclusive celebrities in the past: drug self-poisoning, accidents, depression, and suicide just being a few. It terrified her just as much as it did Monica, that Ohmtown's great mascot and the world's icon could very possibly fall into that breakdown. Eventually, at the sight of Monica's increasingly saddened expression, Gina threw her own worries aside and spoke, \"Listen, Monica. Mok is a passionate man; he absolutely loves what he does for a living, he loves his art. It is his life, and sometimes when some artists love something that's important to them too much, they tend to forget about the other important things in their lives as well, such as loved ones. And they can even forget about the welfare of themselves. Gina paused for a moment to look up at Monica; the strong rat woman looked less upset and more thoughtful now, which was what Gina was hoping for, so she continued: \"Now, Mok is like this (I admit)… but not for all the wrong purposes: an important part of it is Mok just doesn't want to be forgotten . I imagine he'd developed that fear due to his tramp-mother abandoning him as a kitten-pup. Another thing is that Mok has a lot to live up to: he is 'The Magic Man' after all, and 'the greatest icon in music history', and you don't just get handed those titles by doing little, you know…\" Monica nodded in agreement as she kept her eyes out the window of the taxi cab. \"Well, the list goes on, but the main thing here is Mok is a passionate man, and he cares deeply for the things he loves. Sure, he may slip up once in a while and forget to give time to another object of his love… like you…\" Gina placed a wizened but caring hand over Monica's as she finished, \"…But I'm sure that once Mok has realized what he's been neglecting, he'll jump at the first chance to make things right… just like he would for his music.\" Gina waited slightly nervously for Monica to respond, still with her hand upon hers, and eventually Monica did look back down, only this time with a satisfied smile. \"Yeah. I guess your right; Mok always told us he'd never forget his 'little darlings'!\" Both ladies enjoyed a hardy chuckle. \"By the way, tuts', I hope you and your sis' haven't been throwing Mok's name around the NY while you were away. I'm sure Mok has had to tell you of all the calls he's received from angry Nuke York Police officers about mobs of his fans going nuts thinking he'd be there. Hmmmmm ?\" \"Yeah, right. I know; Mok has already had to remind me of that a few times, heh.\" Monica said with a guilty half smile. \"Oh, and one more thing, tuts': don't be so free with my real name either once we reach further into town. I've got a few enemies in the deeper regions of Ohmtown, so once we get there, refer to me by my nickname.\" \"Sure, no problem um… Whatza'… er, Whatzo…Hmmm…\" Monica struggled to remember it. \"The name's What's-Her-Face, tuts'.\" The other woman said with a smirk. ","Summary":" The thick night air was without silence that night in the slightly populated area of Central Ohmtow"},{"Movie":"Rock and Rule","Title":"The Bungalow","Author":"Kewl Veloci","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5314871","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: While most of the fiction I write with regards to my favorite movie, Rock & Rule, tend to stay particularly close to the story line of the movie, this is a fanfiction idea that came to me while I was watching some documentaries about supernatural occurrences. I always wondered if people who are lucky enough to be born possessed with Magical powers, like Mok, ever had the ability to interact with the undead world. So anyways, this short story is going to mostly revolve around Mok Swagger, my favorite character ever, and certain popular elements from Asian folklore. Mok, Rock & Rule (c) Nelvana, blah blah. Enjoy. -- Driving down the dirt road from the nearest airport miles back, a steel black limousine with sharp angled wings and ominous dark tinted windows hovered through a long pasture of nothing but wheat and age-old fencing with the occasional bovine-people working along side their less-then-evolved cousins. The rickety old barns and shacks which popped up from time to time in the far-off distances bore humorous resemblance to most (if not all) of the houses you'd see in the outskirts of Ohmtown, Montana. But of course, Mok could never forget the miserable childhood he had to spend in one of those wasteland ports. But that was a long time ago; now, nearly 30 years and over 20 chart-topping albums later, Mok Swagger (alias: \"The Magic Man\") is worth over billions of dollars in worldwide currency and quite literally living at the top of his game. And it would explain how he could afford to make it here in Fiji, one of the last remaining \"clean spots\" of undisturbed nature left in this post-nuclear war dying Earth, and a hot spot for vacationing by the super rich and super powerful such as Mok. And that was just what he was here for: a long awaited vacation, away from the occasional hassles of trying to keep his Empire of Music and Magic alive and strong, fighting off other competing Rockers and of course feeding the endless musical appetites of his army of fans. Not that Mok ever disliked this lifestyle, mind you; he loved being The Magic Man more then anything in the universe… but even the greatest of all rock gods needed a Sabbath. Turning to a thin, wide-screened computer monitor in front of him to his left side, Mok spoke to it in his handsomely deep, silky voice, \"Computer, how much further until we reach a paved road?\" The endlessly intelligent Computer system, which Mok had hooked up wirelessly into his limousine interior, (mostly for doing business while on travel) also worked well as a GPS unit among other things. The stagnant, simulated voice of a woman replied to its Master: \" Keep traveling north. Four more miles. You will find a paved road marked \"A11\". Take that road until you get passed the bridge at the shores.\" \"Thank you.\" Mok spoke as he drew a cigarette from his floral-covered silk vest and lit it with a match. (\"Your welcome, Mok.\" said the computer.) After spending a few minutes clouding his brain with calming tobacco, Mok spoke again, this time to his limo driver: \"Toad, turn on the radio. I'd like to keep a track of my… fan base… while I'm gone.\" With nothing more then a slight grunt, the huge, hulky guy in the driver's pod reached over and pecked the Radio tuner with his thick, sausage-like finger and tuned the dial for volume before going back to what he was doing. Mok continued to smoke as he listened to the slightly fuzzy radio station AM10, which reported news from all over the lands that were once known as \"America\"; Mok's pointed, cat-like ears pricked around beside his head as he waited for any developments in the categories of Music, or Entertainment, or World Rulerships. Mok had his good reasons for this request: for a Super-Rocker (or any Rocker for that matter) to remain the king of his territory (music, geological, or otherwise), he would have to keep a sharp ear to the media, on the look out for anyone who should try to challenge the Rocker while he is away, and possibly steal fragments of his fan base and/or his respected place in the musical totem pole. This may not make any sense from a human's perspective (if those creatures still existed now, anyways), but in this new apocalyptic world ruled by animal-humanoid mutants like Mok, the Rock and Roll world was no different from the African savannah: the world itself is now a barren wasteland thanks to The War, and in this wasteland the Rock Stars play out the roll of the lions, ruling their \"prides\" of fans and groupies as well as guarding their \"territories\" of recording companies and top media franchises. And just like lions, the Rock Stars themselves held vicious physical and musical fights, often times in front of their fans and women, to see who was worthy enough to carry the electric guitar, let alone make music with it. Only the lions with the greatest gold, platinum and plutonium \"manes\" (albums) would live on beyond their final fights, and such lions with manes like that were one in a million. Mok was one such lion. Perhaps he was the lion of them all, seeing as anyone with the guts, balls and audacity to challenge him has been quite rare. But either way, The Magic Man had lived long enough to see other Rockers (even one other Super-Rocker) fall before him due to their own disregard for control and vigilance. Television, computers, radio, newspapers, and the all too important word-of-mouth served such fine purpose as the musician's eyes on the world, and as so, relieved some stress from the artists but not enough for them not to require a vacation from it all. So therefore, here he was: Mok Swagger off on another one of his many little getaways (he was quite keen to reward himself handsomely), to a land of his sole choice where he could be alone and reflective, though it was not unusual for Mok to be accompanied by a female, either from a whole group of gaggling groupies or just some random girl he kidnapped out of nowhere but produced no resistance to him. They usually never tried resisting, and even those few who did would soon come to their senses under the dark spells of The Voodoo Black Musician Priest. But this time was different; Mok was going at it alone (with the exception of his bodyguard Toad, who no doubt would ditch his Boss eventually to go find some tough street dogs like himself to hustle around the islands with), but if he did happen to find any women around that he deemed worthy enough to be with him, Mok would allow it. Mok didn't mind a little deserved solitude, but he hated being lonely as well. Eventually, the cow pastures were left behind and soon the black limo was gliding on through one of the local towns that were sparsely located around the lands; the populations of the towns were comfortably low, considering the \"Common Class\" and their petty crimes were not very welcome among the super-rich vacationers. As he blew smoke from between his full, voluptuous lips, Mok gazed out the tinted windows at the age-old, multi-colored buildings and the passing street life, recounting the many times he's had to unleash his Magic on the like for trespassing on his property to get photos of him (mostly paparazzi scum), it was no skin off his pointed nose. Ignoring the staring villagers (they could only stare at the limo itself, not Mok who was well hidden behind the tinted windows), The Magic Man watched the background colors go by: topless bar… beach store… topless bar… beach store… Another twenty minutes into the ride, and the limo had made it through the low-grade part of civilization, passed over a long, rusted iron bridge that Mok guessed had to have been there before The War, and were finally met with smooth pavement; the hovercraft of the limo against the flatness had nicer soft sounds, and right away from a gander at the incredible well-built houses that lay hidden behind iron fences and fancy Italian ivy walls that this was a whole different social division. But as nice as all these homes were, none were quite as extravagant as Mok's; at last, after detouring through a dead end street close to the beaches and down through the hidden forest of beach foliage, Toad parked the black limousine at the pathway entrance leading across several acres of warm grass front yard and up to an amazing castle-like fortress situated with the backdrop of the ocean and open sky. Stepping gingerly out of his limo, Mok flicked his cigarette onto the pavement as he strolled down the long tiled pathway through the garden thicket to his estate. Approaching his very tall medieval wooden front doors, Mok pricked his wide pointed ears to catch the lovely sound of the ocean waves beating into the shore that made up his backyard; 'tis a lovely sound to a such a hard-working musician. Mok took out a laser-card key and slipped it through a large bulky slot at the side of the door, but being the spoiled rock star that he was, Mok waited for his big husky bodyguard Toad to pull open the heavy doors for him. Stepping inside, Mok took in the lovely place which he had not seen for a few years: everything still looked the same the last time he was in Fiji, except for the presence of some layers of dust, beach sand, and salt (which Mok's personal convoy of cleaning maids and servants would take care of as soon as they arrived later on); Mok's expensive pointed-heel shoes clomped upon the hardwood flooring of the living room and echoed up to the ceiling as he explored the rest of his vacation house; after making it onto his screened in pool deck with thick floral adornments overlooking the beach, Mok decided he would check out one last thing before he would settle in: the little old bungalow that sat upon the sandy cliff right over the beach and just beyond his pool deck. For as long as he had the shore-side mansion, Mok could remember seeing that little beach bungalow, looking so forlorn out there with its age-old wood framing and its peeling paint. Although he admitted to himself that he could have done something with it sooner, Mok wanted to keep the tiny space for entertainment purposes, much like the rest of his house (though he could probably never get cameras in the bungalow due to the erosion of salt air). Back in his 30's when Mok first bought this mansion, he had originated for the little bungalow to be a \"secret spot\" of sorts for he and his many lady friends to just hang out during the nights when they got too drunk/stoned from Mok's concerts to do anything else. But as Lord Swagger would come to learn from being around the women in Fiji, it was most, if not all, of them were just tourists who had no problems traveling halfway across the world to attend his concerts, but who apparently could not stand being cooped up in some tiny bungalow, even if there was Mok and oral sex involved. Damned spoiled tourists, Mok would always think in the back of his mind, as he would be carrying the bitches up to his rich, air-conditioned and completely sand-free master bedroom. Not that Mok ever gave in because he actually cared about the opinions of his dames; The Magic Man just wanted to get it up and in while he was still the fit stud (and still is). But now he's returned in his late 40's to rediscover the perfectly nice bungalow that once was; 'twas a shame he never got a good use out of the place, and now thanks to his own ignorance, the place was looking rather worn, ironically. And being the man with such high standard tastes in décor and design as he did, Mok wouldn't stand having his image threatened by a mere eyesore in his backyard. Deciding to save the small beachfront's fate for later, Mok turned and went back inside the house, closing the very tall glass doors as he did, just as Toad was unloading his Boss's luggage. It was a couple hours of unloading later (with Toad doing all the real work, of course), and both him and Mok had finally settled into the grand mansion for the next two and a half hours that were left in the day before the evening: The not-so-gentle giant Toad resided down in the spacious living room on the long, winding couch that surrounded the wide-screened computer monitor which was actually a TV; the tube was broadcasting a bunch of programs on professional street dogfighters (something Toad and his brother Sleazy had always enjoyed in the past before they got their jobs as Mok's bodyguards), but the TV was on mute as Toad was on his blocky walkie-talkie phone with Sleazy, making sure his younger siblings Zip and Cinderella, and also making sure they were taking very good care of Mok's real home back in Ohmtown. Meanwhile, the king of the house himself was upstairs on the third floor of his Fiji beachfront, reclining quietly on his enormous silk bed within his master bedroom; the long, wide curving screen monitor surrounding the bed and suspended from above by wires and bars; with a nonchalant look upon his face and his large lips slightly puckered as he searched for a good station, Mok took a moment to run his long bony fingers through his sphinx-like silver wig of long beautiful hair. He sighed as he continued to skim through all 40 channels, wishing now that he had asked for the Premium Movie Package. He hated it when this happened. Mok was bored. And it was not entirely uncommon for Ohmtown's greatest entertainer to need entertaining himself, but what was incredibly worrisome for the common creature was how The Magic Man choose to solve this little problem; being such a creatively-minded man who sired many innovations in the world of music, Mok could think of the craziest and even most incredibly dangerous ways to entertain himself. Some of these would include: Terrorizing random people (fans or not) with his disappearing/reappearing stunt, Terrorizing entire cities by setting off laser-energy spheres and leveling buildings, Slaughtering members of the paparazzi who got in his way, Invading bar stage shows, Or just getting himself shit-faced high/stoned/drunk/whatever and kidnapping random girls. But this also meant that being the legendary rock star of untouchable nature, Mok could get away with anything… and Mok himself knew it. So now that he was officially unable to find anything remotely interesting on TV to watch (certainly not any of his popular music videos), Mok hit the mute button, irritatedly threw the remote away, and just sat back, looking at his bedroom ceiling. As he gazed up at all the fancy lighting, electronics, wiring, and iron cover paneling, Mok sighed, wondering what he should do. There wasn't a city anywhere for miles, so he couldn't go on a rampage or even a shopping spree; he didn't come in any of his luxury airships, so he couldn't just fly over to a city to takeover; it was night out, so there was no longer a point to the beach; the only little town close by was full of simple-minded locals, who no doubt would hassle him for autographs if Mok revealed himself; and the only other person in the mansion was Toad, who obviously wanted nothing to do with his Boss after that long-ass car ride all the way over here with Mok being the typical \"backseat driver\" and complaining constantly about Toad's driving. Still laying out on is bed, Mok looked down himself at what he was still wearing: a velvet maroon vest, a long sleeve white undershirt with fancy lacing down the chest and cuffs, long tight-fitting dress pants that were a darker shade of maroon, a gold chain necklace, and black suede shoes with high heels and pointed toes. Seeing that he was in clothes more designed for the city high life rather then where he was now, Mok decided then and there that he was going to change clothes and just go out to one of the topless bars in town; he decided to go dressed like the locals in order to blend in and avoid creating too much of a frenzy with him being there. And while he was out, Mok was also going to torment some of the local drug dealers in the area into giving him some dope, as he was out of his crack and cannabis. So Mok rolled off his large bed and strolled over to one of his large suitcases marked with his world famous (and infamous) black-striped Goat's Head Insignia, opened it up and began tossing everything out of it and all over his room in his search for something to wear. This will serve that \"dumb waiter\" of mine to slack off on his chores around my houses… Mok thought grumpily to himself of Toad as he pulled out a pair of faded knee-length jean shorts, a thin Hawaiian-print button up shirt, a sea shell necklace, a nose ring, and a pair of sleek sunglasses. Mok also rummaged through a very special case full of some of his expensive wigs from home and chose the one with long, brown wavy hair. After changing in his large upstairs bathroom (which had just been renovated with a giant hot tub), Mok looked himself over and was surprised to see how young he now looked; the faded jean shorts that looked a bit baggy over Mok's long muscular legs were none-of-the-less very comfy and definitely something pretty much everyone he's seen today has been wearing, and the Hawaiian T-shirt he had on was only held shut by one button, thus still allowing a show of Mok's muscular chest and handsome rows of abs ( Why cover up something others could only wish they could have? Mok thought proudly to himself.) And last, Mok ran his long, clawed fingers through his head of now wavy, brown (albeit fake) hair that fell to his open chest and framing his seashell necklace. Mok gave himself a quick once-over, smiled admiringly at himself (as he always did), and quickly got on his way out, slipping into a pair of brown open-toe sandals that Toad had managed to remember to leave by the sliding-glass door to the pool deck. Meanwhile, Toad was still over in the living room jabbering on the phone with his brother Sleazy over the latest runner's up for the Dog-Fighters Championship in Russia; he never did catch his Boss leaving the house. But then again, why the hell should he care what the eccentric super-rocker did with his life? --- A.N: Chapter 2 coming soon.[Chapter 2] It was about a thirty-minute walk down the sidewalks of the high-class 'hood and down the street near the shore until he reached one of the small towns. And being from a small town himself, Mok always found comfort in the slow-motion attitude and way of life of the rural kind; it was a very uncommon perception of a legendary rock star, but perhaps that was just evidence of Mok's natural uniqueness among all other rockers. So far, The Magic Man's change of guise was working well for him, as he was able to walk comfortably amongst the common Fijians down the dirty streets without any hassle; eventually after some strolling, he came across a bar that looked well enough on the outside to suit his personal tastes, and he entered. Inside, the bar was a little run down like most of the town, but not too badly; it was slightly similar to the scumbag Mylar's nightclub back in Ohmtown, except by the wooden walls and hardwood flooring as well as the Western decorations and scratchy ceiling speaker music. The patrons within the bar all looked like beach rats, monkeys, sand foxes, gulls, and iguanas, all with slight tans and even some with small radiation skin burns (most likely evidence of the irregular nuclear weapons tests that sometimes go on close by the islands). As more folks moved in through the door-less opening to the tables, Mok walked over nonchalantly to the long bar and took a seat at a stool; when the bartender eventually made it to him, Mok pulled out his leather wallet from his baggy jean pants and ordered three shots of straight liquor and a bottle of scotch. The bartender, who looked like a potbelly pig with a nice tan, took the pay and left to get the orders, and Mok turned himself around and took off his sunglasses to do some innocent people watching around the pub, something he wouldn't be able to do easily had he not come in disguise; along with the drunken and chain-smoking men there, Mok was more interested in the lovely ladies, particularly this one broad with a pretty vixen face and sandy-brown fur with a belly of white. The woman was dressed in a very skimpy outfit made up of a thin wet t-shirt and white shorts that barely covered her thighs but were strapped over her waist with a thick leather belt; she was serving drinks to two men in the corner of the bar; because people kept walking by, it was a bit hard for Mok to make out any other details of her… Just then, there was the sharp sound of a table bell, and the bartender's call, \"Order up\", could be heard. Mok, calmly turning back around in his stool, was met with a nice set of liquor shots and a tall bottle of one of his favorite types of scotch. Thanking the guy, Mok pinched one of the shot glasses between his long, nimble fingers and, throwing back his head, quickly drank down the whole amount of its contents before setting the empty back down; then he did the same with the other, and then the last third one, each hit of pure alcohol searing his mouth and throat but bringing great pleasure and peace to the rest of his body and mind. Now starting out his evening with a nice buzz, Mok gazed lazily over his shoulder to return his studies of that pretty little thing serving the drinks… but she was not there. Slightly baffled, Mok looked around the pub, thinking to himself, That girl sure left in a hurry… do they pay her just to serve a single table? Hmmmmm… ah, I'm sure she'll be back. I'm sure I'll get another chance…\" Mok had a smirk on his thick lips as he took up his bottle of scotch, broke the cap off with his long, white teeth alone, and took a few long sips, turning around in his stool and resting up against the bar top coolly as he kept his eyes opened for that foxy broad… About 20 minutes later, just as his eyelids were really beginning to grow heavy and his mind tipsy with intoxication, Mok's otherwise sharp eyesight finally spotted the woman returning, shadowed by the dull lighting of the place. As Mok watched her from beyond the overshadowing locks of his long brown hair, the woman seemed to be looking for something, or someone, with great intent; her large ears and head were held low and her pointy little nose wiggled with scent searching. Whatever she was searching for, Mok didn't care; he was going to redirect her attention to him, one way or another. Believing that she must be one of the waitresses at the bar, Mok got an idea as he noticed the drink he still had clutched in his large paw; turning his head to the side (with one piercing eye still on her) he quickly guzzled down the rest of the entire bottle of his scotch, then held the bottle up high in the air, indicating that he was a customer who had just run dry. Sure enough, the rock star's plan worked like a charm: the woman caught sight of Mok lazily waving his empty bottle around while resting his head in his other hand, elbow on the hardwood bar table. The lady's large ears pricked up and her head lifted with great interest, but that was it, no rushing over to appease the customer or anything. Just a stare of great interest. Mok was miffed: Dammit, woman, get over here! Suddenly, the girl, still with her sight set on Mok, began to advance right towards him; she moved rather swiftly around the tables and people obstacles in her pursuit of him. Mok noticed her strange and sudden eagerness to get to him, and he began to worry: Uh oh. Has she somehow seen through his disguise? Is she the only person in this facility sober enough to spot those famously huge lips of his? Or was all this worry just a conception of Mok's own lack of sobriety? Mok braced himself (as best as he could while now growing very intoxicated from his sudden intake of booze) for the moment of impact, which was so terribly commonplace to him by these damned rabid fan-girls; even other men strived to embrace The Amazing Magic Man once they recognized him, and they in particular hurt when he is grabbed by them by the arm, leg, or long furred tail. In Ohmtown, these sort of occurrences rarely, if ever, happened, for the Ohmtowners deeply feared and respected their resident super-rocker, who has brought so much needed tourism and revenue to their poor, run-down town in the state that was once called \"Montana\". But have Lord Swagger get caught in pretty much any other town other then his hometown and forget it: Mok would have to pull off a series of deadly spells just to get on with the Touring. But when Mok's wandering mind returned himself to the most amount of reality as he could through drunkenness, he was surprised to see the girl come to a calm stop right in front of him, staring up at him sitting in his high stool so cool like, still with that same incredible curiousness. Of course, it was not abnormal for many people to just stare at Mok like he was some sideshow freak; he was a man born of magical powers! But Mok was also a very keen man to spot the difference between frightened curiousness and blank stares of naivety. And this girl showed no sense of fear whatsoever that Mok could pick up on. Finally, Mok was the first to speak: \"… What… took you so long… to get over here?\" Mok tried his best to not slur his words, but the room was spinning faster. The woman did not speak; she merely looked off to the side, looked at the hardwood flooring, then back at him, and shrugged. Growing now more irritated with her clear lack of care for service to him, Mok spoke down on her again: \"Weeeellllll…? Do you even work here, woman?\" Mok puckered his thick lips and tried to look serious, even though he was bracing himself against the long bar table, trying to stop himself from swaying. Again, the woman said nothing. She just shook her head calmly. Now Mok was the curious one here. \"Then… why did I… sasses you sssserving drinks… e-earlier…?\" Now the alcohol was really beginning to kick in: not only was his speech slurred, but Mok's lean, muscular body was rocking back and forth precariously on the tall bar stool. The booze did have a good side affect, though: it was making the rock star less aggravated then he normally would be and just more curious of this odd vixen. The girl looked over her shoulder at the table in the corner of the pub that once seated the two men being served their beer that Mok had definitely seen earlier that evening. But then she just turned back and said nothing, her furry eyebrows raised in such a way to suggest that The Magic Man must be mistaken. \"… Ansssswer me, woman!\" Mok ordered, frowning as he was loosing his balance; he clenched at the empty scotch bottle he still held in his paw until the glass suddenly burst apart under Mok's strength. He went down… **** The next thing he knew, Mok was staring up at the ceiling of the same pub, but soon came to realize he was in an entirely different room in the building; the rock star was laying on the floor, surrounded by high shelves of all kinds of old and outdated supplies, ranging from food spices to protective radioactive suits hanging on rusty hangers from the creaking, dead wooden shelves. As Mok's vision began to return to its normal sharpness, and his handsomely chiseled nose began to wrinkle at the awful sight of all the dust around, he suddenly became aware of someone applying a wet towel to his forehead and gently stroking his bare, muscular chest. Mok gazed slowly over to his side and his eyes met those of the sand fox woman. And from that point, it was an unofficial staring contest; and with the better lighting of the room and their distances shortened considerably, Mok was finally able to put forth better study of this female specimen he has found: she was indeed a vixen, with sandy-brown fur that was short enough to not be very noticeable, rather large ears with white fur growing out from inside, and long pointy face that was more pretty and elegant then anything else; her eyes were also interesting, as they were large dark brown irises that were set behind sleek Asian slits; and as Mok's own piercing irises wandered down the rest of her body, the rock star could already feel his crank being turned by her beautiful but fit physique (not that Mok was ever that picky about his many concubines). Feeling his eyelids slipping and still heavy from the alcohol that still lingered in his bloodstream, Mok took a small breath and sighed as his eyes made their way back up to the woman's face, and when they settled on hers again, he gave a little, \"…Hmmm…\", like it was nothing. Finally, after all this time, the woman spoke: \"Are you alright, Sir?\" That accent. So she's Asian. Good. I haven't been with an Asian woman in quite a while… Mok thought to himself. Mok's thick, prized lips curled into that cheeky little smirk which went so well with his personality, and he answered, \"Why yes. Yes I am, thank you.\" \"Are you sure?\" The woman asked. \"Yes.\" Said Mok calmly. \"Don't worry, I've had bigger falls.\" The woman sighed and then she laughed. And when she laughed, Mok started to chuckle deeply. They both laughed, hell it wasn't that bad. And it was kind of true: Mok had taken much worse spills in times of outside drunken behavior, and he's even been in more awkward situations when meeting women, but that was mostly back when he was just a damn kid. The woman then wrapped her arm behind Mok and helped him to sit up; as he long locks of brown hair fell around his face, Mok rested it against the nape of the woman's warm neck; he took in her scent as his instincts told him too, and he enjoyed it, not caring much if the woman disagreed with his behavior or not. And surprisingly to Mok, she apparently didn't, for she wrapped her other arm around the man whom she was not at all aware was a rock star (let alone perhaps the most powerful and famous one at that). The girl then rested her head on Mok's wig of soft hair. Mok was slightly intrigued by this, but otherwise he was uninterested, as it was no different then how most women acted around him and his Magic… After a moment or two of this unexpected but pleasurable embrace, Mok's deep slightly raspy voice asked her, \"Forgive me, dear, but I never caught your name.\" \"Oh, my name is Kayoni Montego-Ken. But you can call me 'Kay' if you wish, Sir.\" The girl said kindly in her slightly broken English. Mok lifted his head from her chest and looked right into her, speaking in lovely poetic tone, \"Ah, but just as a rose by any name smells just as sweet, you by any of the two makes for no difference in your beauty, my dear.\" It took a few moments for her to get it, but at these words, the foxy woman had no other option but to profusely blush and giggle with excited admiration of this odd man, especially with Mok's piercing eyes looking right into hers. And then he added: \"Oh by the way, 'Kay', you do not need to call me 'Sir'. My name is mmmm Mok … thank a lot.\" As usual, Mok found himself practically singing glory to his own name, and pride was just a drug. \" Mok , is it? … I have heard of you.\" Kayoni smiled, her interest in this man growing bigger with every minute, though it was hard to tell from her rather stoic nature. \"And I have heard that one before.\" Mok ended with a laugh as he began to struggle to his feet, groaning as his head was still spinning around; it was never easy for Mok Swagger to stand back up on those long, nimble legs of his, not to mention when drunk. Kay immediately got up herself to help the much taller man as he staggered to his feet; Mok could feel the girl becoming slightly intimated by his height (her head barely reached the top of his chest), but other then that, \"Kay\" was quite comfortable with walking him out of the narrow back storage area of the pub. Several bar employees had to squeeze their way past them (luckily, they also failed to see past Mok's clothing and thick wig) until Mok was led to a flimsy back door held closed by a stack of books and a rusty dog's choke chain around the knob. Kay attempted to open the door herself, but struggled to do so while trying to keep the drunken Mok from falling over himself; it felt like a whole friggin hour to Mok as his irritation started to grow right back: \" Can't you get the damnnnn thing to opennnn?\" He grumbled, stumbling back and forth. \"I'm trying as best I can, Mr. Mok, honest.\" Kayoni spoke, her broken Asian accent slightly pleading with him as she just could not undo the rusted lock that was set into the plywood siding of the flimsy door. Eventually, Mok was tired of waiting. He wrapped his long strong arms around the girl's neck as a brace as he dizzily said to her, \"Nnnnnow you ssssstand ssssstill… I'll llll-get this, mmmmmy dear.\" \"No really, you don't have to, Mok. I can do- \" But before she could even finish her sentence, Mok had targeted the door, pulled back one long, muscular leg, and… BASH! … Kicked the door open, right off its hinges; it tumbled through the cold night air and landed in the middle of a dirt street where people scuttled to get out of its way, but after observing that it was not a grenade, they went back to their nightly rituals. With laughter escaping through his large lips, Mok looked down to see the vixen so stunned at such behavior that she was speechless as she stared from the destroyed door in the road right up to this crazed man who now had a hold on her. Mok got his cheeky smirk back as he boasted, \"If you think thatssss impressive, you mmmmshould see my Magic acts! Come! Let us go to my humble abode… mmmmy dear.\" And with that, Mok grasped Kay around her volumtous hips and hoisted her up over his should without breaking a sweat; Mok was slightly surprised to see her not struggling. Mok's had a few women fight back pretty viciously when he's captured them as his little concubines, but most of the time they calm right down once they remember the great rock star who has chosen them for his prestigious harem. But as Mok proceeded to carry the fox girl with him out of the back of the bar and down the dark streets towards his house, Mok felt an innocent calm from her; it was almost as though she had predicted this would happen or something. But once again, nothing unusual about predicting when the Magic Man was in the mood for a little innocent kidnapping. As Mok carried her though the streets, the roaring of the ocean and the songs of the wind in his ears, he wasn't getting any more sober, so he began to sing in a crazy attempt to synch himself with the wind and the water. Mok's gait was rather gangly, but at least he was strong enough to keep from falling over and taking Kay with him. Speaking of which: \"Ssssay Key, how do you like my sssinging?\" Mok asked in a sing-song tone that he knew made all the girls laugh. Kay was no exception: \"Hee-hee, I love your singling, it's beautiful. You are lucky to be so talented, Mok.\" It was perhaps the first time since they met that Kay's shown this much emotion. \"Ah, but singing isn't my only talent,\" Mok gleamed as he lifted Kay off his shoulder and held her to his chest, with her legs wrapped around Mok's lean waist. \"You're forgetting about my Magic…\" \" Hay you! Get over here!\" A voice suddenly ordered out of the thick collection of palm trees and mangrooves, and there was a sound of paws traveling right at them from behind. It took the inebriated Mok a few seconds to realize someone else other then Kay was addressing him. With his pointed, cat-like ears pricked forward, he turned himself around to see who was coming at him. Imagine how high his long, thin eyebrows went when he saw about five dark-clothed and raddy looking thugs coming out of the dark woods at him, each holding what looked like small daggers. But Mok's surprise was very short lived. Throughout his life as a citizen of the not-always-friendly-streets of Ohmtown, Mok's had more then his fair share of the common thief packs. And, even in a state of drunkenness, The Magic Man knew exactly how to deal with them… \" Ggggentlemen! Why in such a rush to see me?\"[Chapter 3] Suddenly, like a ninja in the dark, Mok shot out a hand, capturing the first thug by the throat and gripping his other large hand around the other's arm, twisting it so painfully that the raggedy local dropped something from his hand into the beach sand. The second the object [which turned out to be a pocket knife] hit the floor, Mok yanked his throat-gripping hand back away with what seemed like little effort; this resulted in a wet, tearing sound and the sight of crimson spewing from the would-be-thief's neck before he was dropped to the floor. Cupping his own hands around his irreversibly damaged vital area, the thug rolled around upon the sandy ground, right at the feet of the chuckling musician, uttering such awful sputtering and gurgling that one from afar could only assume the Magic Man had enchanted him with a foul spirit, just as he has commonly made such a sport of. It all happened so fast that neither of the other thugs could fully grasp what had just happened; they each stood there, blindly staring at their assumed gang leader, who lay upon the dirt floor dying at the feet of a tall disguised man whom they never would have guessed would be the closest living thing to the very Spawn of Satan. One of the men even began to weep, calling out the name of his fallen comrade, though his cheap words were nothing more then cheap band-aids for the situation; whatever the guy's name was, it flew right over Mok's drunken head as he finally looked up from the blood shed he left and over to where the rest of the potential thieves still stood, anchored to their spots by some kind of wicked force which exuded from the Super-Rocker. Just then, with the roar of the ocean as his cheering crowds and the howling wind as his backup singer, Mok threw back his head and emitted a deep-throated laugh which eventually evolved into a higher pitched shrieking cackle into the evening air, just as the sun finally died behind the horizon beyond Mok's lean, shadowy figure. With the joys of a good thrill and a kill now free flowing in his cold blood, Mok looked to his opposite side, where he was surprised to see the young vixen gal still standing in the same spot where he had left her. Studying her face, Mok felt no immediate fearful or panicky energy surging from her, as he usually felt from the many women whom have been witnesses to the occasional loss of life caused by the Voodoo Black Musician Priest; instead, Mok could only feel the slight cold chills traveling through the young woman's body, mixed with a bit curiousness and high admiration. All these feelings were certainly not expected of her by Mok or anyone for that matter, but this was not the first time Mok had found ladies who you could say were cool with his actions. \"… Hurr, hurr, hurr…\" Mok gave a funny laugh before he spoke, \"… Wazz'matterrr, honey? Mmmrrryyyou don't miiiinnnnd that I take caaaarrrreeee ov'thiiiissss, m'do yoooouuuu?\" Mok's words seemed to get more and more slurred as the minutes passed by; the rushed intake of alcohol from earlier was really beginning to drag him down, his tall lean body swaying back and forth and his long, lion-like tail began to drag to ground. But Kay seemed none-the-wiser of this… or of anything for that matter. None of this seemed relevant to her; she replied to Mok with the innocence of a creature devoid of sentience: \"Why no, Mr. Mok. Not at all. Go right ahead.\" Mok smiled, his thick lips giving off a slight glisten in the moonlight, and his dark eyes overshadowed by his thick womanly eyelashes. Over on the other side, two of the men looked at each other, terrified and confused; one asked the other just as Mok turned to look back at them: \"Who in the hell iz' dat' guy talkin' to?\" \"I don't know, man! Fucker's gotta' be insane of something!\" They both looked back with growing fear as Mok spoke once more to them, \"Mmmm'well, gentlemennnn, it sssseeeemmmmssss m'you all have just caussssed my sweet, sweet girl and I a bit offff trouble… mmmm'it would alsssso sssseeeemmmm that none of you rememberrrrr who I ammmm. Ssssoooo with that in mmmmind, I willll care to ssssparrrre a ssssmidget of mmmmy timmmmeeee to remind you…\" Then to the horror of the remaining young criminals, Mok held out a long muscular arm and out from the middle of his palm there was a sudden burst of blinding neon blue light that minimized into what appeared to be a kind of \"scepter\", about two feet long and half an inch thick, and made of pure dark Magik energy. Bringing the strange neon glowing thing to his side like a dagger, Mok began to slowly advance towards the men, who were surprisingly still trying to hold their own like the fools they were, even though they were clearly beginning to cower back. Pulling out their own weapons of choice (no guns, just pocket knives and letter-openers), the young dirty gangsters had no time to react when the next of them was suddenly grabbed out of no where by Mok's quick hand and stabbed in the ribcage with the glowing appendage; blood spurted everywhere from the burned hole in the unfortunate man's body as he was quickly discarded by Mok onto the floor like a piece of trash. \" My…\" Left in the same wake as the first guy to go down by The Magic Man's hand, he contorted and then simply fell still in his own crimson mess; Mok gave a laugh of drunkenness as he swaggered towards the next guy, who had the nerve to actually rush at Mok with his pocket knife out to the ready. But Mok need only dart out of the way just in time to both avoid the guy's knife and also cause the stupid thug to run right into his energy rod, gutting him right in the heart. With this kill, Mok uttered the second word: \"… Name…\" He moved on to the second to the last guy, who screamed like a banshee as he dropped his weapon and tried to bail, but was grabbed by a quick-footed Mok and had his throat slit open with such violent display. \"… Is…\" And after calmly dropping that guy to the floor like litter, Mok closed in on the final man, who dropped his weapon and fell to his knees at the sight of having his comrades killed right before his eyes; he begged the musician for his life, but there was no mercy to ever be found in Mok's soulless eyes which were glowing a striking white light. He dispatched the final man with a simple slitting of the throat. \"… MOK!\" A few minutes of reveling in his massacre took place before turned his head after chuckling a bit to see the young vixen woman he had playfully kidnapped still standing in her exact same spot; there was a long line of dead bodies and a river of blood which separated the two of them, but Mok could see and feel no fear from the girl, only mild surprise and even a hint of admiration. Throughout his whole life, the only woman who could ever calmly stand Mok's sudden fits of violence towards other living beings was his lifelong best friend, Gina, whom now worked beside him as one of Mok's many consorts and henchmen to keep much of the population of the Western world under his Magical control. Mok waited a moment or two to test Kay's potential \"girly-freak-out\" reaction time, but it never came and she never did. So Mok spoke, still with slurring words, \"Mmmm… dear, m'your taking this so well… most ladies would have run for the hillssss by now… I must have ffffound a good faithful girl in you…\" Had Mok not been so drunk, his normally hawk-like eyes would have noticed Kay's soft Asian ones eyeing the saber of Magic energy still gripped in Mok's now bloodied paw. When Mok mentally disintegrated the glowing energy bar and absorbed its Magical content back into his body, Kay's eye switched from his hand to his eyes, with her large fox ears up to his attention; Mok walked forward, casually stepping over each dead carcass until he stopped about a foot away from the younger woman. It was a rather awkward moment of silence as the two of them stood there, staring at one another as if neither was sure what to say to the other after such a crazy event: Kay looked Mok up and down, taking in the musician's blood covered paws and feet, his blood-stained unbutton shirt and blood-spattered bare chest and abs; Mok, still concerned about whether he had just lost himself a hot date due to his very bad temper and lack of self control, but still too drunk to stay focused on either problem, so he just simply stared back at her like his cat-instincts told him to until the other party reacted first. And eventually Kay did, in the most unusual way… Kay smiled up at Mok like a little child that's found a parent, and threw her arms around Mok's lean waist, hugging him and snuggling her cheek into his warm muscular chest. She was even chuckling to herself a little. Mok was quite surprised by this, but never showed it and quickly just assumed he was in the presence of a woman who has probably witnessed just as much gruesome violence in her life as he did living in the impoverished streets of run-down Ohmtown all his life. Not to mention his pal Gina's rough life in Nuke York of all places. Mok hesitated to embrace her back at first, but relented the second his sharp rodent nose caught her sweet scent… or when his large, pointed cat ears heard her sweet chuckling… or her warmth against his warmth… Mok wrapped his limber but muscular arms around her, and rested his chin on her forehead; Mok's wig of long, flowing brown hair fell around his head and around the girl's head as well, which she never minded; the two of them stood there, alone on the beach, the wind softly dancing around them, the ocean singing to them its eternal song… lost in each other's embraces, amongst all the bloody massacre that lay before them… like two serial killers who were about to take their final bows… ","Summary":" Author's Note: While most of the fiction I write with regards to my favorite movie, Rock & Rule, te"},{"Movie":"Smallfoot","Title":"Sleepy Kitten","Author":"Sunnyflight170","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13164245","Passage":"[Chapter 1] last one, I promise. Cat owners, I don't know about you, but I can definitely relate to this. In fact, my own cat lying on me was how I got the idea! Also, I'm going to change the title as soon as I get an idea for a better one. I'm aware the one I have now is a bit strange. On we go! DISCLAIMER: I own none of the characters who appear in this story ... \"Meechee!\" a voice hissed. Meechee looked up from her sketch in the snow. She'd come down the mountain to sketch out some designs where there were fewer footprints from other yetis. Nothing important, of course- she saved those for the cave walls. She'd been humming while she worked, until the voice had broken the quiet peace. She looked around, trying to find the source. It sounded like it was coming from a nearby cave. \"Meecheeee!\" it hissed again. Walking closer and peering into the cave, she locked eyes with Migo. He was lying on his back, looking at the cave entrance with a desperate expression. When he spotted her, he gestured wildly to his chest. In the dim light, Meechee noticed Smallfoot on top of him. She started to laugh, bringing a hand to her mouth to muffle it. Migo scowled at her. \"It's not funny, Meechee! He's asleep, and I don't want to disturb him, so I can't move. I heard you outside and called you in here so you could help me, not laugh at me. Can you please get him off?\" \"Awww, but why? You guys look so cute,\" Meechee teased him, smirking. \"Meechee!\" Migo cried, trying to keep his voice low. \"Can you just take him for a few seconds? While I stand up? Then I'll take him back.\" \"How did you even end up like this?\" Meechee asked, crossing the cave and to next to them. \"He was on his way up to us,\" Migo began explaining. \"And I was on my way down. We met just as the wind picked up, blowing snow into our faces. We came in here to wait it out, and I let him lay on me because the ground is super cold hard in here and they don't sleep on stone like we do. He fell asleep, and he looked so peaceful that I didn't want to move him myself and risk waking him, even after the blizzard ended. I can't even sit up! Meechee, you have to help me! I haven't moved in hours!\" \"All right, all right,\" Meechee said, giggling still. She carefully lifted the sleeping smallfoot off of Migo, cradling him in her arms like a baby. As Migo got to his feet, Percy turned over in his sleep and wrapped his arms around Meechee's forearm and wrist, smiling and blissfully unaware of what he was doing. Meechee held her arm out, her hand facing the bottom of the cave. Percy tightened his grip and buried his face into her fur, using her arm as a pillow. Not sure what to do, Meechee looked up at Migo and found him smirking at her. \"Not so funny when it happens to you, is it?\" Meechee rolled her eyes. \"Okay okay, I get it. I'm sorry I laughed. Will you help me now?\" \"Actually, I think we should let him stay there. For now, at least,\" he said quickly, seeing her glare. \"Until we get him back into town. I don't know if we could get him off without hurting him, and the girl smallfoot can.\" \"Good point,\" Meechee admitted. She lifted her arm, once again cradling Percy in them. She and Migo walked out of the cave, trekking down the mountain to the town beneath it. They went to the place where Migo and Percy had first met. Brenda was sitting inside, at a table near the window. She was on her cellphone, looking irritated. \"Percy, where are you?\" she said into it. \"I've been waiting here for almost an hour. Call me whe-\" she stopped as she spotted two of the Yetis coming. \"Gotta go,\" she said before hanging up. She walked outside, waving cheerfully. \"Hello!\" she called, coming to a stop. The female yeti growled something, then stepped in close to her and crouched down, revealing that she held Percy in her arms. Brenda brought her hand up to her mouth. \"Oh my gosh,\" she giggled. \"This is gold .\" she took a picture of him, with his arms still wrapped around Meechee's arm and a blissful smile on his face. Putting her phone back in her pocket, she carefully detached him from the female yeti and lifted him from her, supporting him with one arm. His head lolled onto her shoulder. Brenda nodded at the Yetis gratefully. \"Thank you for bringing him here,\" she said. She looked down at the sleeping man, unsure on how she would get him back home. She could try to carry him, but her chances of making it all the way to his house while walking were unlikely. Even if she decided to take him to her house (which she was now realizing might be a better choice, since she didn't have a key to his), it was still a long walk. A flash of blue caught her eye, and she saw that the male yeti was holding his hand out flat in front of her. \"Oh,\" she said, carefully laying Percy down on it and sitting there herself. \"Thank you.\" Migo stood, holding them protectively next to his chest. The girl smallfoot (Migo suggested they call her Girlfoot- Meechee said no) pointed down the road, saying something in her smallfoot language. Migo followed her instructions until Girlfoot (he couldn't help it, it just stuck) pointed to the right. He continued to walk where she pointed until they came to a building. Brenda pointed to the ground, and the yeti set her down gently. She lifted Percy in her arms, nodding at the pair. \"Thank you,\" she said gratefully. She walked to the door, propping Percy against her shoulder while she unlocked and opened it. With one last wave to the Yetis, she carried him inside to her couch. After she'd set him down and put a blanket over him, she went to her computer and plugged her phone into it. After a few taps of the keyboard and clicks with her mouse, she was grinning at a blown up picture of Percy in the girl yeti's arms. She would never put it online, of course, but it would be fun to tease him with every once and awhile. After all, they were close enough friends. He would do the same to her.

Where the village is abuzz with excitement. Orange and pink lanterns stream across homes and workshops. Large icicles are carved in elegant patterns and strung over wooden posts by our mammoths. Every yeti rushing to and fro with food, furniture, and even more decorations. Our ancestors had a tradition where if a male and female wanted to mate, the boy would have to go through a series of obstacles, each one challenging his strength, wit, and loyalty to his supposedly true love. If he managed to get through all of the tasks, he would then have to face the greatest, most difficult one of all; defeating the girl's father in battle. No weapons, no certain fighting style, nothing. It was just them and their fists. I've been told that most of the duels were brutal, nearly fatal. And once, or if, the male made it, he received the female's hand in marriage as a reward. But many years later, we came up with a holiday that didn't endanger the men with broken bones and/or the lost of their lives. And was, in all, much more resolvable. It is known as the Pairing Festival. And it's today! Tonight, men and women will join in dance, food, drink, and reluctantly choose someone to be with for the rest of their lives. It's the most exhilarating, most romantic time of the year and everyone enjoys it. Especially me, Migo. I've never participated in the activities before, due to age requirements, but this is my very first year. And like every other resident in our village, I am just as giddy as everyone else. And nervous. Boy, am I nervous. I'm not gonna lie, I have my doubts. Ever since we found the mythical creature known as the Smallfoot, asking questions nonstop became a natural habit. Mostly to feed my curiosity. But now they taunt me. What if I don't find the one? What if I don't find anyone ever? As a matter of fact, I know of a number of yetis who never married, usually out of choice, but for those who never wooed or failed to do so are known as the Outcasts. They couldn't find a significant other to mate with. They are rejected by society and considered lonely. They are never happy. I fear that this will become of me. Yet my father, Dorgle, told me that I'm practically guaranteed to find a girl what with my dashing good looks. He said it, not me. And he also said to not worry. It took him three years before he found my mom. This, of course, comforted me. But still, my doubts ring in my head like echoes in a deep, dark cave; hollow and endless. I straighten up and continue with combing through the fur on top of my head. Dad says that for the festival, presentation is everything in meeting a girl, and I had to look my best. So with a final tug, I get out the very last knot and set my comb on my desk. I look down into the shallow pool in my restroom and my furry white face beams up at me, my reflection revealing a neatly groomed yeti. Satisfied, I straighten my back and walk out into the the busy street. Sunset has arrived and the town looks spectacular in the dimming orange and yellow rays peeking through the mountain's crevices. I weave my way through the crowded paths, shoulder to shoulder with others of my kind. They wear bright, toothy smiles, but their eyes betray just how anxious they are. Guess I'm not the only one. Despite the fact that when a couple chooses to be together, it's ultimately the females choice. She becomes the head of the two; deciding where they will live, what their profession will be, and when they will have their children. She even names them. The thought makes my hands go numb so I run them together in an uncertain manner until I can feel them again. We stop at the ever familiar giant ice berg chiseled into the head of the very first Great Stonekeeper. His icy blue eyes seem to daze off into the distance, as if searching for something. Three people stand in front of it; Thorp, The present Stonekeeper, and Meechee. My heart beat suddenly elevates at the sight of her. I'm going to admit it to myself now before I can second guess myself; I really, really like Meechee. I mean who wouldn't? She's so amazing, smart, and brave. Did I also mention she is absolutely beautiful? Because she is! I've had a crush on her before I even liked girls. She's everything a boy could ever wish for and more. I catch movement out of the corner of my eye and turn to see her waving at me. I return it shyly. The Stonekeeper steps forward as he clears his throat and the people go silent. \"Welcome everyone, to this year's Pairing Festival.\" He says in his booming, yet calming voice. The crowd cheers loudly and naturally quiets down when they know he's ready to speak again. \"This is a very special time of year, where men and women come together to find that special someone. To bring forth love and to become one in holy matrimony. \"Now let us celebrate and enjoy this blessed holiday with smiles and warm hearts.\" The Stonekeeper says, spreading his arms wide in emphasis. We all shout joyfully in agreement and begin to mill around. Some people are so ecstatic that they introduce themselves right away. Shaking hands, exchanging names, inviting each other to the long table of snacks and beverages. Yet others, such as myself, stand off to the side and watch. All of us waiting for someone to come up to us, or for the courage to step up to others. I just stay there, fiddling with my fingers like a complete nervous wreck. I don't know what else to do. Within a half hour, nearly everyone is socializing. Eating and drinking the rare fruit juice we only get this time of year. Supply and demand is too great for us to have the luxury of consuming fruit frequently, so we save it for incredibly special occasions. Like now. I'm one of the the handful of stragglers who still have not found someone to talk to. A feeling like cold stones dropping into my stomach makes me shiver. Dread. Oh man! This isn't good. I should've found someone by now, I think worriedly. \"Hey, Migo.\" Someone says in front of me. I snap my head to see the one and only Meechee smiling up at me. \"Oh. Hey there.\" I say in return. \"Quite a party, isn't it?\" She asks. \"Yeah. It's amazing. You know, this is my first year.\" I say. I may as well start some small talk with her. It's better than being alone. \"Really? Me too.\" She says. We fall into an awkward silence and I shift uneasily on my feet. Yes, I may like Meechee, but to her I'm just a friend. I know for a fact that she doesn't feel the same way about me as I do her. Which is okay. She may be my dream girl, but I'm not her dream guy and all I want for her is to be happy. And if that's not me, then that's okay, too. Suddenly, she gasps. I look at her and give a confused expression. She smiles and chuckles nervously. My brows furrow even deeper. \"Laugh.\" She whispers. \"What?\" I ask. \"Laugh like I just said something funny.\" She says again. Without a second thought, I do as she says and I laugh. I'm actually surprised at how real it sounds when I hear myself. Must be from being so on edge. I continue to smile at her when I'm finished. \"Why did you make me laugh?\" I say through my teeth. \"My dad is right behind us. He's expecting me to be on my best behavior.\" She says quietly. I take the quickest of glances to see that, true to her word, the Stonekeeper watches us a few paces away. He grins warmly at me. Grinning? Why is he grinning at me? Did I do something wrong? I don't get the chance to answer my own thoughts before he leaves us alone. \"He's gone.\" I say through the corner of my mouth. She swivels her head around instantly and gives a big sigh of relief. I let out a shaky breath myself. I didn't know I was holding it in until I heaved it out of my chest. \"Have you found anyone yet?\" Meechee asks, bringing me back to reality. \"To be honest, no. I haven't found anyone yet.\" I admit. \"Me either.\" She says. What?! Really?! Meechee, the beautiful daughter of our leader, found no one?! Is that even physically possible? Growing up, boys would whisper about Meechee when she walked by. I would observe how their eyes trained on her every movement and talk amongst themselves about how much they wanted her. And now hearing this in the present is almost unbelievable. But nonetheless, I simply shake it off. \"Hey, what do you say we get out of here?\" She suggests. \"Yes, please!\" I say, relieved. Okay, the festival is great and all. It really is. But the anxiety is torture! All of the pressure and lectures from our elders about how to act and what to say and do is practically crushing me. How the heck do people do this year after year? Meechee takes my hand and pulls us away, squeezing us through a narrow exit between two shops and we vanish into the night. Somehow, no one sees us leave. I'm actually surprised, and yet not. Everyone is so busy with searching for a boy or girl to be with that they don't bother with what is happening around them. So with that, I leave it be. Meechee leads us through a maze of neighborhoods and past the village entrance. Sprinting together, our arms pumping by our sides, we dash away without any second thoughts. We end up running through the snowy drifts of the mountain slopes, sliding down the steep face expertly until I accidentally trip over my feet and knock both of us down. We tumble and skid until we stop next to each other in a heap of snow and limbs. And we laugh. But this time, we full on howl, clutching our stomachs and wheezing and gasping for breath; a real laugh. We then take a stroll down the mountainside and talk. The sun has long since left and is replaced with a giant canvas of glittering stars. The moon gazes down on us in a heavenly glow. Puffs of white escapes our mouths on every exhale, proving to be chilly, but the cold isn't a bother. Besides, we've had worse. We come upon a sharp cliff and Meechee drags us to the edge to sit down, side by side. I've never been on this side of the mountain before. The drop from up here to the trees down below is much greater than what I'm used to, an extra hundred feet at least. Yet not too long ago, if someone were to sit here in this very spot, they would only see thick, white clouds unknowingly made by the yetis who dwell at the top of this mountain. But now, a wide, open landscape of frosted mountains and valleys stretch across the horizon. A small city twinkles below, surrounded by tall groves of pine trees. \"You know, I'm really glad.\" Meechee suddenly says. I look to her for a response. \"Ever since we found the Smallfoot and became friends with them, I've been really happy. Happier then I've ever been.\" She says, lifting a shoulder slightly. \"Because now we can finally understand more about the world and see beyond the mountain. And it's all thanks to you.\" She says. She turns to me, smiling. I can feel heat rising up my neck and to my cheeks. I hope she can't see it. I rub the back of my neck at her comment. \"Well actually, it was you and the others who made the discovery. I just happened to see one. Lucky I guess.\" I say shyly. \"Yeah, pretty lucky.\" Meechee says distantly. Her eyes focus on the jeweled town below. The flickering lights sparkle in her eyes. She faces me again and her dazzling eyes flicker uncomfortably. I realize that that I've been staring at her this entire time and I immediately look away, embarrassed and my cheeks flaming. Why am I so nervous? Seriously, it's just Meechee, the girl who makes my tongue twist and string out words unintelligently. The girl who makes me forget everything as time slows to a stop. Yep, there should nothing to worry about. \"Speaking of Smallfoot, did you know that they can make their beverages super hot and super cold?\" Meechee asks abruptly. \"Actually yes. I do know that.\" I say. Some of the tightness in my throat loosens and I can finally breath normally. At least Meechee's trying her best not to make this a super unpleasant night unlike me. \"You know what else I know?\" She says, her voice rising. \"And what may that be?\" I ask quizzically. \"More than you about the Smallfoot.\" She states, smirking at me playfully. \"Oh really?\" I say just as coyly. Whatever awkwardness had been in the air disappears almost immediately, replaced with a more friendly, mischievous atmosphere. Thank goodness. \"Then tell me something I don't know.\" I say. As expected, she rises to the challenge. \"You're on.\" She says. She shifts her seating a smidge so that she is in a more comfortable position. \"Well... lets see... oh! I got it! So, did you know that the Smallfoot and us actually share behavioral actions.\" I blink at her. \"No, I did not.\" I say dumbfounded. \"What kind of actions do we share?\" \"A lot, actually.\" She replies. \"Can you tell me a few?\" I ask. \"Sure. There's the...\" She takes a moment to think. \"Well, you know when you're nervous and your heart is pounding super hard? They act the same way.\" \"Whoa! Really?\" I ask. She nods her head. \"And...\" She draws out slowly. \"...both of us have the tendency to hold hands.\" She says. Just now, a light weight places down on my knuckles and I glance down to see her fingers lining against mine. My eyes widen at our joined hands. \"I-Is that a-all?\" I stutter. My nerves are now jumping under my fur, as if her hand is shooting lightning bolts into my bones. \"No, there's quite a few. But the one I remember the most is...\" Her head raises up to mine and I'm suddenly hypnotized, captivated by her beautiful gaze and sweet touch. I lean in closer, and if I'm not mistaken, so is Meechee. We are inches apart when- Crack Something underneath us gives a jolt. Our heads whirl around frantically in search of the movement and sound. CRACK It goes off again, louder. Resonating off of the tall stone walls. A wide crack has split through the ice right behind us, getting bigger by the second. It spreads rapidly from one side of the cliff's tip to the next in an instant. Before either of us can react, the crack reaches the edge and the large hunk of of ice we sit on falls with us with it. We plummet toward the ground, screaming and flapping our arms and legs helplessly. The wind whistles by as the floor gets closer and closer. Out of pure instinct, I reach over, yank Meechee's wrist to me, and curl my body around hers, my back facing the ground. BAM The impact is like being hit by a giant mammoth from behind as I crash into the forest floor. Snowflakes and flecks of ice fly around us in a swirling mist. I hear another loud thud and the ground vibrates under me; the cliff's tip. When the flurry settles, we pant breathlessly together, the exhilaration taking its toll. \"Wow. I was not expecting that.\" Meechee says. I look up at her and my breath hitches in my throat. She lays on top of me, her hands holding my shoulders. My own hands grip her waist and I freeze on the spot. Meechee doesn't seem to notice our state until she sees the thin line of my mouth. When we yetis jump off of the mountain and onto the forest floor, the speed and momentum has us fall straight through the snow, creating deep craters in our shapes. This time, it's much deeper and there is barely any room for the two of us because of how we landed. I've never been this close to a girl before, especially one I'm practically sure I'm in love with. \"Oh... um... uh...\" I stammer. As if this night couldn't get any more unbearably awkward. \"Oh... sorry.\" Meechee says. \"No no no, you're fine. I'll just-\" I say as I try to sit up when a sharp pain stabs right through my spine. \"YOW!\" I screech. \"Are you okay?\" Meechee says in a concerned tone. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just in a little pain.\" I hiss through gritted teeth. \"Are you sure-\" She goes to ask. \"Yep. Nothing I can't handle.\" I reassure her. She doesn't look completely convinced, but otherwise lets it go. \"Okay. Just relax a bit, though. Maybe it'll go away.\" She counters. \"Yes mam.\" I say sarcastically, but I obey her immediately when she gives me a warning look. We stay there for a while, pressed together in deafening silence. A few tall pine trees peek through the top of the hole, stretching towards the inky black sky. I try to keep the muscles in my back slack as Meechee instructed. She repositions herself a little better so that her feet trail to the side, her long, lavender braid strays along my stomach, grazing my hip. I look away, trying not to gape at it or her. I don't want to come off as some sort of creep. \"Hey, Migo. Can I ask you something?\" Meechee asks quietly. I nod my head for an answer. \"I just...have to know.\" She ventures. \"Why did you grab me when we were falling?\" I come up short. I have no idea why I had pulled her to me, as if I were trying to protect her. \"I don't know.\" I answer honestly. \"I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I just... did.\" I can't help shrugging my shoulders a bit, which results in a stinging pain in my back. Note to self: Stop moving so much. Her eyes follow me and I'm once again lost in those blue orbs. They're just so big, so curious. They remind me of wide open skies. That's when the most unexpected thing happens. In a flash, Meechee reaches up, cups my face, and kisses me. KISSES ME! It's just a peck, but I'm left staring at her with my jaw dropping wide open. \"I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.\" She says nervously as she brushes a long lock of hair out of her face. \"It-It's okay.\" I say huffing. My heart beats against my aching ribs, threatening to crack a few of them. I forget that Meechee's hands rest against my chest because she speaks up. \"Your heart is racing.\" She says. \"Yeah. It is.\" I say back. Her fingers slowly rake through the thick fur above my collarbone and a shudder runs through me. Somehow, I'm not afraid. If I had ever thought that a scenario like this would happen, I would think that I would freak out, any reasonable person would if they were me. But I'm not, and that puzzles me. She suddenly leans down and kisses me again. But this time, I return it. Have I ever kissed someone before? No. No I have not. So when I fully realize that I'm kissing Meechee, I stiffen in shock. My mind goes completely blank, but my body seems to know what to do. My hands grip her thin waist, stroking the silky strands of her long fur and they slowly wrap themselves around her back. Meechee combs her fingers through my chest, my shoulders, all the way through my neck. Our lips massage against each other as if they had practiced it a hundred times. A feeling spreads through us, warm and soothing; pleasurable. When the need for air becomes too great for either of us to handle, we separate. Her short, hot breaths tickle my chin and a grin tugs at my lips. \"That was...\" I say, unsure of what else to add. \"Yeah.\" She finishes. We chuckle nervously and avoid one another's eyes. Something inside of me, something I had buried deep down for years, begins to come up. Crawling it's way from the pit of my stomach to the tip of my tongue. If I don't ask her now, I'm pretty sure it'll rip me apart from the inside out. \"Uh... Meechee?\" I utter cautiously. She peers up, her features expectant. \"There's something I have to tell you.\" I say. She continues to look at me hopefully. At this, I gust out my chest and prepare myself for the worst. \"Ireallylikeyouandiwantyoutobemymateforlife.\" I ramble out. She quirks her eyebrows, clearly confused. \"I'm sorry, I didn't get that.\" She says, with a lighter note to her tone. I take a deep breath and say it again, much slower this time. \"Okay. I really like you, and I want you to be my mate for life.\" I finally say. Her mouth pops open in a big 'o', and now that I've finally gotten that off my chest, I can't stop. \"I've had a crush on you forever, and ever since our adventures with the Smallfoot and spending time with you... I want to spend the rest of my life with someone who is brave, smart, and is the most beautiful person I know.\" I glance up at her, but she remains unmoved. \"It's you.\" I whisper. All of a sudden, I begin to regret every single syllable that just fell out of my mouth. Sweat prickles my back bone and I fumble with my next words. \"But-But if you d-don't want me, i-it's okay. I just... had to let you know b-before you found s-someone else.\" I look away, too ashamed to even see her reaction. Did I come off too strong? Did I do the right thing? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I feel Meechee reach over and tilt my chin up to face her. She wears a sympathetic look, her gaze full of kindness. \"Migo, why would you think I would just turn away from you?\" She asks. Confusion plagues my thoughts. Wait, what does she mean? \"The reason I asked you to leave the festival with me was because I wanted to tell you how I felt about you. That I really like you and... I was hoping that you and me could... become... you know. Mates.\" She says attentively. I gawk at her as if another head has sprouted out of her neck. She wants to be with me? Like how I want to be with her? I can't believe it! \"Really?\" I squeak out. She nods her head vigorously. \"Really?\" I ask again and she giggles. \"Yes, Migo.\" I laugh hysterically. I'm not sure if laughing is the most orthodox thing to do at the moment, but I can't help myself. All of the nerve racking preparations for the festival, my overwhelming feelings for Meechee, the sudden falling off the cliff, kissing the girl of my dreams, has been nothing but this huge emotional blizzard. Everything crashing onto me with the determination and almost deathly perseverance to blow me away into oblivion. Yet I'm later accompanied by Meechee, so I figure that it's not something to be considered unacceptable. A thought doesn't occur to me until we're both shaking and roaring with laughter; We are in love, and that puts me to a stop. I need to tell her. Now. \"Meechee.\" I say to get her attention. She quiets down and her face becomes suddenly worried, but I know not to fret about it, especially with what I'm about to say. \"I love you.\" I say. A sort of weight lifts from my shoulders and my stomach's innards unravel themselves from the nervous, twisting knots it has created. Meechee's eyes spark and a smile spreads across her mouth. \"I love you, too.\" She says. I crane my neck up and give her a quick kiss. I can almost see a pink tint light up on her cheeks when I pull back. \"What do you say we get out of here and get back to the festival?\" I ask. \"That would great.\" She says. I let her get to her feet and crawl out of the deep hole before I sit up and follow her. My back still hurts, but now it's just sore. At the least, it'll be better by tomorrow. As we trek back up the steep mountain, I feel Meechee's hand clasp mine. Her soft, light touch is comforting and loving. Our two adjoined hands fit together perfectly, like two pieces of a puzzle. Never in a million years would I have guessed that tonight would have gone like this. If someone were to tell me a day or two before what was going to happen, I definitely wouldn't have believed them. And yet here I am, walking with the woman of my dreams who I now know loves me as I do her, miles away from the Pairing Festival. Life has a way of unfolding itself strangely. The end! ","Summary":" It's that time of year again. Where the village is abuzz with excitement. Orange and pink lanterns "},{"Movie":"Smallfoot","Title":"Bear Cubs and Injured Feet","Author":"Sunnyflight170","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13175111","Passage":"[Chapter 1] about the title, AKA I have no idea what to call this thing, and that is the first thing that came to mind. Also, I would be lying if I said I got the bear idea entirely on my own. It partially came from the user cute-fanart on Tumblr. Migo is pushing Percy close to the bear and saying \"now you can be friends too!\" I'd show it to you, but doing so without the artist's permission is stealing and I'm too shy to ask. It's really cute. If you can, you should check it out. Anyway, enjoy! DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of the characters that appear in this story. Except for two of them. ... \"Migo? Are you here?\" Percy called as he ducked through the cave's entrance. After a few tries, the yeti had communicated that he wanted to Percy to meet him in the cave where he had mistakenly thought Migo was going to eat him. Percy had promised he would be there. He just hoped he didn't show up too early- Migo hadn't been able to communicate a specific time. Thankfully, the yeti was seated in the middle of the floor. When he saw Percy, he beamed and got to his feet. \"Smallfoot! You made it! Come on, there's someone I want you to meet.\" he held out a hand, prompting Percy to climb on. He lifted the smallfoot up to his shoulder, where he pulled himself up and sat down. The pair went deeper into the caves. \"Hello,\" Migo called, trying to keep his voice low. \"Mama Bear? Are you here?\" Percy squinted in the dark, trying to see what Migo was looking at. Something lumbered into the cavern. Recognizing it immediately, Percy scrambled backwards and fell off Migo's shoulder with a yell of terror. The yeti caught him in his hands, but then set him down and pushed him closer to the bear. \"Hey there,\" he said, his tone apologetic. \"We're really sorry about what happened a few months ago. Almost waking your kids and all that.\" The bear huffed. \"Well, I suppose it's alright.\" \"Are your cubs awake yet?\" Migo asked. \"If you don't mind, I'd love to meet them.\" \"They are. I can get them- just one moment.\" she turned around. \"Ayla! Orso! Come out here! We have visitors!\" Percy flinched at the bear's roar. He wanted to run, but Migo was blocking his exit. Maybe he didn't realize you had to give animals their space? Or he didn't worry about them because they weren't nearly his size. Unfortunately, the same wasn't true for Percy. A couple of shadows came at them, and Percy squeezed his eyes shut and cowered against Migo's hand, expecting the worst. A couple of bear cubs bounced out, looking up at Migo curiously. Migo smiled at them. \"Hello,\" he said. One of the bears came closer, sniffing at Percy's face. Percy cringed, expecting a bite. Instead, he felt the roughness of a tongue swipe over his cheek and part of his eye. He opened them, and came face to face with the bear cub. \"Hi!\" she squealed. Migo moved his hands away suddenly, and Percy fell back with a yelp. The bear jumped on top of him, and Percy let out an oof. She really wasn't that heavy, but he was unprepared for the sudden weight. She put her paws on his chest, sniffing his hair and ears. She poked her nose into his neck, and Percy giggled and tried to push her away. \"Stop it,\" he said. \"That tickles.\" Ayla looked at him curiously, having never heard that noise before. She sniffed his neck again, causing him to laugh harder. \"I'm seherious!\" he said between the laughter. \"Quit it!\" Ayla couldn't understand him, but she got the sense he wanted her to stop. But she wasn't going to- not until she'd smelled every inch of this strange new creature. Percy watched her, giggling helplessly as she moved onto his chest sniffed along his side. It wasn't too bad- his coat was protecting him from the worst of it. She moved to his stomach, sniffing at his coat. She frowned- the red thing he was wearing was blocking her. After a bit of investigating, she found an opening at the bottom. Perfect , she thought, sticking her nose into it. \" Nohoho !\" Percy shrieked. \"Stop- donhon't do that! Man, your nose is cold !\" he managed to get out, reaching forward to grab her. She pulled her head out of his coat and ducked away from his hands, sniffing at his legs and then bouncing down to his feet. Percy relaxed and leaned backward. She could sniff at his boots all she wanted- it wouldn't affect him. Ayla sniffed at the brown things. They didn't smell quite like the rest of the person. She gave one of them and experimental nudge with her nose. It slid, and she smiled in satisfaction. They came off! She began to tug at it with her teeth, holding his leg down with her paw to keep it from moving around and loosening her. Percy watched her in amusement. It was cute how hard she was trying, but there was no way she was going to get the shoe- Ayla grinned in success as the brown thing came off in her jaws. She immediately started on the other, getting it off in seconds. It was easy now that she'd done it before. She sniffed at the persons paws- she assumed that's what they were. There was another layer, this one white, but it didn't stop her. Percy giggled as she began sniffing his foot, and drew his legs back into his chest. \"No,\" he told the cub, still laughing. \"I think you've sniffed me enough now. Leave my feet alone.\" Ayla looked at him in disappointment, but walked away to go check out the yeti. When Percy looked where she was heading, he saw Migo smiling down at him. He glared at the yeti, but with no real anger in his eyes. \"You easily could have stopped her, but you let her do that, didn't you?\" Migo growled something, feigning innocence. Percy rolled his eyes, then turned his attention to the bear cubs. He crouched on his knees and watched them, a soft look on his face. Both cubs were looking up at Migo, making little growling noises. Migo was growling back- if Percy had to guess, he would say they were communicating. \"I'm Migo, and that's Smallfoot. I don't think it's his real name,\" he admitted. \"But I don't know what he's called, so I've stuck with Smallfoot.\" Percy approached them cautiously, keeping an eye on the mother bear for signs of aggression. When there was none, he waved at the bears and smiled. \"Hello,\" he said. He held his hand out, and the other bear cub approached him. Percy rubbed his hand over the cub's ear, similar to how he would pet a dog. He was fully aware that bears weren't pets, but the mother bear didn't seem to mind. And they were pretty cute- when they weren't tickling him. \"He seems nice,\" Orso said to his sister. \"I know he's bigger than us, but do you think we could take him in a wrestling match? Like when we wrestle each other?\" \" I could,\" Ayla said. \"You? I'm not so sure.\" \"I could so!\" Orso protested. \"I'll prove it.\" he crouched on to his haunches and leapt at Percy, knocking him over onto the cave floor. Percy put his hands out to fend him off, and the bear cub pawed at them and made playful growling noises. \"Oh, I get it! You're trying to wrestle with me.\" Percy was sure he could pin the cub, no problem, but he didn't want to hurt him. And play fighting was an important part for bear cubs- it taught them self defense. He curled his fingers in, making them sort of resemble paws, and batted at the cub gently pushing him away in the process. He got to his knees, crouching on one and trying to stay as low as possible. He didn't want to tower of the cub, after all. Orso smiled- he'd seen how tall Smallfoot was, and knew he could easily stand to avoid playing with him. But he wasn't, which meant it was time to take him down. He and his sister had made rules for the wrestling game- they had to try and pin each other, and when one accepted defeat, the game would end. \"Ayla!\" Orso called for his sister. He saw her sitting on the yeti's foot, trying to sniff at the bottom of it and causing the yeti to laugh. Orso rolled his eyes- what was with her and sniffing everything? \"Ayla,\" he called again. \"Help me pin Smallfoot! He's too big, I can't get him all on my own!\" \"Coming!\" Ayla bounded over. \"What do you want me to do?\" Percy looked back and forth between the cubs as the growled at each other. He got a bad feeling that they were planning something- something for him. Sure enough, the girl cub looked at him pounced. He kept his head up so it didn't hit- that was bound to be painful. The cub put her paws on his shoulders, using all her weight to effectively keep him pinned. The other cub- the male- jumped onto his legs and spread across them, keeping them pinned as well. Percy knew he could easily lift the girl cub off with his arms, and move his legs aside to move the male, but he put his hands in the air and allowed his muscles to relax, going limp. \"I surrender,\" he said, smiling up at the girl. \"You've defeated me.\" \"He surrendered,\" Ayla said excitedly to her brother. \"We win!\" \"Yay!\" Orso cheered. He hopped off of Percy's legs and leapt at his sister, bowling her over. \"Your turn!\" \"Hey, no fair! I wasn't ready!\" Percy smiled at the cubs as they wrestled each other, getting to his feet. As cute as the cubs were, he didn't want them getting too used to people. He thought he should leave while they were busy. Apparently mother bear had the same idea, because she growled something at the cubs and they stopped wrestling immediately. They came to sit at Percy's feet, and he patted each of them on the head. \"Good bye, little guys. It was nice meeting you.\" the cubs smiled at him and went to Migo, who patted them as well. \"Bye Ayla, bye Orso. This was fun- maybe I'll stop by again sometime. If it's alright with your mom.\" \"Please do!\" Ayla said. \"Today was amazing!\" \"Ayla, Orso,\" Mama bear said, a warning in her tone. \"It's nap time- come on now.\" \"Okay mama,\" Orso said, running to her side. Ayla followed after, and the bears lumbered deeper into the cave. Percy grabbed his boots and started to walk, heading for the cave entrance. \"That was fun,\" Percy said to Migo, smiling up at his friend. \"I can't believe that's the same bear we saw in the cave. She seemed so much angrier at the time.\" \"The cubs really seem to like you! And Mama bear was totally warming up to me- she didn't even say anything about wiping our feet!\" Percy laughed. He had no idea what Migo was saying, but he seemed to be really excited. Maybe those bears were friends of his? Percy froze suddenly as his foot hit something hard, his big toe exploding with pain. He cringed and gripped the wall, screwing his eyes shut. The first few seconds were always the worst. When the pain dulled from sharp stinging to a dull throb, Percy opened his eyes to find Migo looking back at him in concern. \"You okay, Smallfoot?\" Percy smiled at him weakly. \"I'm fine. I just stubbed my toe on this-\" Percy fumbled for his phone, shining it's light on the object. \"-rock.\" Migo looked at him blankly, and Percy slapped his forehead. \"Hand signals. Right.\" he set his boots down and propped the phone against them, steadied himself on the wall as he pulled off his sock, then let go as he took the sock in his left hand so he could at the big toe with his right. \"I stubbed my toe on that rock,\" he said. He held his foot next to the rock, balancing on one foot. \"Like this.\" he attempted to kick the rock (carefully- he didn't want to break his toe) but lost his balance. Arms windmilling wildly in attempt to get it back, his foot came down on top of the rock, it's sharp edge cutting into his foot and forming a large cut. Percy cried out in pain, grabbing the foot and hopping backward. His back hit the wall and he slid to the ground, still cradling his foot in his hands. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly, tighter then when he'd stubbed his toe, clenching his foot hard. \"Ow,\" he whispered, whimpering slightly. \"Ow, ow, ow.\" his ears detected a faint beeping, and he opened one eye to see Migo holding his phone between his fingers- the yeti was so big, the phone looked like a lego in his hands. Percy sat up straight, his eyes widening in alarm, and lunged forward. \"Hold on, what are you- ah, ahhh, ow!\" he cringed, leaning back to lean against the wall. He settled for watching Migo, leaning to the side so he could at least half see the screen. He squinted. It looked like Migo was in his contacts... now it looked like he was calling somebody… Brenda's face appeared on the screen, and Percy leaned forward slightly in alarm. \" No ,\" he hissed, sliding his hand across his neck in hopes that Migo would understand. \"No, don't tell her anything!\" Migo growled something and started to turn. Percy waved his back and forth in panic. \"No no no nonono- heeeey, Brenda!\" Percy smiled weakly, glancing at his foot and subtly reaching down to cover the wound. \"Percy?\" Brenda looked at him in confusion. \"Why did Migo call me? And where is your shoe? And your sock ?\" \"Oh, they're here,\" he said vaguely, gesturing with the hand not holding his foot. Brenda looked at his other. \"Why are you holding your foot?\" \"Oh, uh… I may have stubbed my toe on a rock. And then in an attempt to show Migo that I stubbed my toe on the rock, accidentally cut my foot.\" \"What?!\" Brenda yelled, her eyes widening. \"Hold on Percy, I'll be right there with a first aid kit. Do not move!\" \"Wait, no, you don't have to- annnnnnd she's gone.\" Percy scowled at Migo as the yeti set his phone down and beamed at him. \"I hope you're happy with yourself,\" he snapped. He sighed, shoulders deflating as the anger left his body, and slowly moved his hand away from his foot to check on the wound. He cringed- there was a long, ugly scratch. It was still slightly bleeding, and his hand was covered in blood. He glanced up at Migo. \"is it as bad as it looks?\" but Migo wasn't looking at him- his eyes had locked onto Percy's hand, and after a few moments, his eyes rolled back into his head and he fell backward. Percy winced as his head banged onto the ground. He started to get up, but… \"Ahh!\" he moaned in pain and sank back to the ground. \"Right, my foot.\" he watched Migo worriedly, wishing he could check on him. After a few minutes, Percy heard the roar of Brenda's snowmobile come up. Her figure appeared in the distance, and she rushed closer with the first aid kit swinging from her hand. \"I'm here Percy,\" she said, crouching by his side. She glanced over her shoulder. \"What happened to Migo?\" \"I don't know,\" Percy said, his tone scared. \"He was looking at my hand, and then suddenly fainted.\" \"Can I see?\" she asked. When he held his hand up, she used the light of her phone to scan it so she could see. \"It's coated in blood,\" she noted. \"Maybe he has hemophobia?\" \"That would make sense. He got his toe trapped in a bear trap when we first met, and when I got it off, a drop of blood squeezed out. He fainted then too.\" \"A yeti who has hemophobia,\" Brenda said, laughing and shaking her head. \"How could we possibly have been scared of them? \"Well, don't worry. He'll wake up soon. In the meantime, let's get this clean up.\" she opened her first aid kit and pulled a wet wipe out of it. When it was open, she took his foot gently in her hands and glanced up at him apologetically. \"This may hurt a bit.\" she put the wet wipe on the edge of his foot, and Percy flinched and tried to pull away from her. \"That's cold ,\" he said as Brenda grabbed his ankle and held it still. \"It feels weird.\" \"I need to clean the cut before I can bandage it. I'm sorry, it's just going to have to feel weird.\" Brenda held him firmly as she cleaned the blood off from around the cut. When that was done, she got a new wipe and put the used one in a small plastic bag she'd brought. When it was sealed inside, she gripped his ankle tightly and prepared for the resistance she knew she would get. When she put the wipe over his cut, Percy flinched violently and tried to pull away again. Brenda wouldn't let him. \"I'm sorry Percy,\" she said. \"I know it hurts, but I need to get it clean.\" she went down the whole length of the cut, and then put the wipe in the little bag with the other. When she looked back at the cut, she saw a thin line of red still seeping out. It had started bleeding again. \"Give me one second,\" she said to Percy, grabbing her phone and typing something out. \"What are you doing?\" Percy asked curiously, leaning forward. \"Trying to figure out a way to slow the bleeding.\" she scrolled through the options. \"Ah, here we go! How to treat foot lacerations.\" \" what ?\" \"A cut on your foot. Lie down.\" Percy blinked, caught off guard. \"Uh… why?\" \"The website says to apply pressure to it if a lot of blood is coming out, and-\" \"But there isn't a lot of blood,\" Percy protested. \"Only a- oh. Oh, nevermind. I guess there is quite a bit there.\" he rolled his hand at her. \"Continue.\" \" Anyway ,\" Brenda said. \"It says lying back and keeping your foot above your heart will also help slow the bleeding.\" \"Alright,\" Percy said, slowly leaning back onto the cave floor until he was lying out flat. Brenda opened another wet wipe, using it to wipe the blood away. When it was gone, she quickly placed it in the bag and grabbed a gauze pad, opening it and pressing it over the cut. The blood didn't soak through- it seemed that having Percy lie down worked. Brenda carefully removed the gauze and put it in the bag with the wet wipes. Then she grabbed a roll of gauze from the kit. She wound it around Percy's foot until the cut was completely covered, and then taped it down so it would stay. \"Almost done,\" she said. \"Almost?\" Percy asked, sitting up. \"What else is there to do?\" \"We need to clean your hand off,\" she said, pulling out yet another wet wipe. \"Oh, yeah.\" Percy held his hand out to her, his palm facing up. Brenda cleaned the blood off of it, then put the wipe into the zip-lock bag and zipping it closed. She put it into the first aid kit and packed it all up. While she was doing that, Percy pulled his sock and shoe back on. As he was getting to his feet, Migo started to stir. \"Hey Migo,\" Percy smiled softly at him as the yeti sat up. \"You okay?\" \"Smallfoot!\" Migo took Percy in his hands, gently lifting his arm with one finger so he could see his hand. \"You were hurt- there was blood on your hand. And your foot-\" \"I'm alright,\" Percy said, giving Migo a thumbs up as he wiggled his injured foot. \"See? I'm oka-ahhhh!\" he cringed, his shoulders rolling forward as he grabbed the foot in his hands. Even bandaged, it still hurt when he rubbed it against the shoe. He looked up and saw Migo looking at him in concern, then plastered a fake smile on his face. \"Okay! I'm okay,\" he said, not wanting his yeti friend to worry. Migo wasn't totally convinced, but Percy was smiling, so he might have been okay. He lowered his hands to the ground so he could climb off, but… \"Ah!\" Percy cried as his feet hit the ground. \" Blimey , that hurts !\" he dropped down to one knee. \"We bandaged it! Why does it hurt so much?!\" \"The cut was partially across the ball of your foot,\" Brenda pointed out. \"Maybe that's why? We might want to get you checked out by a doctor.\" \"I'm fine,\" Percy said, standing with a wince of pain. \"I just need to get used to it.\" he took a few steps, wincing every time is right foot hit the ground. \"No way.\" Brenda got Migo's attention and pointed at Percy, gesturing for him to pick him up. Migo happily obliged- he could tell that walking was putting his smallfoot in pain, and he didn't want that. Percy yelped as Migo took him in his hands, setting him in his palms and holding him close. \"Migo,\" he said, his tone frustrated. \"Put me down, I can walk.\" \"No, you can't,\" Brenda cut in. \"When we get to your house, I'll call the doctor so he can tell you what I already know. You need to stay off that foot.\" she walked out of the cave with Migo close behind, and hopped on her snowmobile. She looked up at Migo and pointed to the town. He nodded to show he understood, and they both went down the mountain. Migo followed Brenda through town until they got to Percy's house. \"Okay Migo,\" Brenda said, gesturing to him. \"You can set Percy down now.\" \"Bye little guy,\" Migo said, giving Percy a careful hug before setting him down. \"You get better, okay?\" he waved and smiled at them before making his way back home. Percy walked to the door, using the key to unlock it before striding (or attempting to stride) inside. \"See Brenda?\" he said. \"It's better already.\" \"Mmhm. Sit down and get your shoe off- I'll call the doctor.\" Percy sighed, plopping into a nearby chair and kicking off his right shoe with his toes. \"I don't need the doctor,\" he said, starting on the other as Brenda dialed a number in her phone. \"It's all ready banda- ah!\" he cried out, tensing as the heel of his shoe brushed against the cut. \"Bad idea! Agh!\" he sunk back into the chair, watching as Brenda pressed the phone to her ear. \"Hi, Nurse Swan... My friend got a long cut on his foot, from the pad down to the edge. I've already cleaned and bandaged it, but I wondered if there's something else I should be doing?... Sure, I'll hold.\" after a few moments, she caught movement out of the corner of her eye and turned to see Percy standing with his coat in his hands. \"What do you think you're doing?\" she asked, eyebrows raised. \"Hanging my coat up. I'll sit back down after.\" Brenda started to say something, but heard a voice speak in her ear. \"Ma'am?\" \"Yes?\" Brenda asked, turning her attention to the phone. \"This is Doctor Miller. I advise your friend to take it easy for a few days. Tell them to try to stay off the foot as much as possible, and come in if there are signs of infection. Keep it dry, and change the bandage every few hours or if it gets wet or dirty. They should be fine.\" \"That's what I thought,\" Brenda agreed. \"Thanks, Doctor. I'll tell him.\" she hung up and turned to face Percy. \"The doctor agrees with me- stay off of it as much as possible until it heals.\" Percy sighed. \"Fine, I will.\" \"That means no treks up the mountain to see Migo,\" she continued \"What?!\" Percy protested, jerking upright. \"You're saying I can't see him at all ?\" \"No, I'm not saying that,\" Brenda assured him. \"I'm sure he wouldn't mind coming to see you himself. And if you want to leave your house, he would probably have no problem with carrying you.\" \"Sure, whatever. I doubt he'll come- he has his own life to live.\" Percy crossed his arms and leaned back again. Brenda smirked at him as she headed for the door. \"We'll just have to see,\" she sing-songed, striding outside and leaving Percy alone. Percy sighed in relief. He hoped that Brenda was right. He enjoyed seeing his yeti friend, and wasn't sure if he could go too long without seeing him. Like Brenda said, they'd just have to see… ... so, the two parts to this story have absolutely nothing in common at all. But I loved doing it, so that's good enough for me! :) also: all the doctor information came from various websites Ifound. If you have a cut, please don't refer to this story. Do your own research or contact a doctor- I have no idea just how accurate this is.

Just a few mildly embarrassing moments for Percy. This is basically just a weird idea that came to me, but it was super fun to write! Enjoy! DISCLAIMER: I don't own any of the characters who appear in this story. ... Percy hummed as he drove his fingers through his hair, lathering the shampoo into it. When his hands came back covered in white, he rinsed them under the showerhead and stepped back under the stream of water. He drove his hand through his bangs and down through the rest of his hair. When he felt certain that all the shampoo was gone, he stepped out of the stream of water and then out of the shower, grabbing the towel to get the majority of the water out of his hair. The rest he blew dry, then brushed it out. It wasn't perfect, but it would do. He toweled off his body until it was mostly dry, and looked at his clothes in distaste. In retrospect, getting back into the clothes he'd worn all day just after getting clean in a shower didn't sound like such a good idea. Instead, he grabbed his robe off the hook and pulled it on. He could grab pajamas from upstairs, bring them back down, and change into them. As he tied the sash around his waist, he left the bathroom and went up to his room. While Percy was grabbing a set of pajamas and clean underwear from his dresser, Migo and Meechee had come to his house to visit him. Migo peered into the window, seeing the human standing with his back to them. \"Hello Smallfoot!\" He said, waving in the window. Percy turned and spotted him, his eyes widening. \"Oh! Uh, h-hey there, big guy.\" Percy subconsciously pulled on the bottom of his robe. It only came to an inch above his knees- not nearly as long as he'd prefer when he had other people around him. And considering he had nothing on underneath it… The yeti growled something, gesturing for Percy to come outside with him. He shook his head. \"I can't right now,\" he said. \"I have to get changed. But I'll be out in a minute!\" he assured him, holding up one finger to symbolize his words. He turned and started for the stairs. Only a few steps from his goal, Percy heard a loud crack. He turned halfway around and yelped, dropping his pajamas in shock when he saw a yeti hand coming at him. It grabbed onto him, circling his torso and holding him firmly, but gentle too. When he was sure he had a good hold on Smallfoot, Migo drew him out of his home, which is what Meechee said it was called. He was certain that the smallfoot had said he could only come out for a minute. Why else would he have held up one of his fingers? \"Hello,\" he said, smiling down at him as he adjusted his grip to let the smallfoot sit in his palm. He breathed in deeply. \"You smell funny,\" he said. \"Sweet. What is that?\" when he received a blank stare in response, Migo pointed at Smallfoot, (carefully) tapped his nose, gave him a thumbs up, then held his arm out in question. \"O-Oh,\" Percy stammered out. \"Its my shampoo- it smells like strawberries. I can show you, but I need you to put me back inside.\" he pointed at his house. Thankfully, the yeti seemed to understand. He moved him closer to the window. Almost there , Percy thought hopefully. Just a few more inches … he stretched out his hand, fingers just barely brushing the window sill. \"Hi!\" a voice called. Migo turned, unintentionally bringing Percy farther from his goal. Nooo! He cried internally. Sitting on his knees, he looked for the person that had interrupted him. When he saw them, he buried his face in his hands. \"Oh no,\" he moaned. \"No no no, this is so bad! Why are you doing this to me, universe?!\" \"Percy?\" Brenda asked, looking up at them. \"Is that you? What are you wearing ?\" Percy sighed, leaning over the edge of the yeti's hand. \"Hello Brenda. A bathrobe. I'm wearing a bathrobe. I was just able to convince him to put me back inside so i could change, when you showed up.\" \"I see,\" Brenda said, struggling to keep a straight face. The male yeti lowered his hand suddenly, inviting her to climb on it. She did so without hesitation, and Percy scooted backward quickly. His cheeks were aflame. Brenda smirked. \"I expect you to tell me how you got into this situation later,\" she informed him. She eyed his robe. \" After you get some clothes on.\" \"Of course,\" Percy said, rolling his eyes. He pointed to the window again, and the yeti brought them close to it. Brenda climbed off first, then held her hand out to him. He sighed, then took it and stepped through the window. The minute his feet hit the floor, he crossed the room to where his pajamas had fallen, carefully kneeling down and snatching them. He started for the stairs, glaring at Brenda one last time. \"We will not speak of this,\" he said curtly, stalking down the stairs to change. Brenda laughed, curling her arms over her stomach. When she got that video from Percy, she'd never thought it would lead to events such as this. She walked down the stairs just as he came out of the bathroom. \"We'll go back out in a minute,\" he told her. \"I have to get something from the kitchen first.\" \"What?\" Brenda asked curiously. Percy glanced at her, his cheeks turning red again. He mumbled something, and Brenda cocked her head. \"What was that?\" \"Strawberries,\" Percy whispered. \"Why do you need strawberries?\" \"The male yeti said I smell nice. I told him I'd show him what the smell was.\" Brenda raised and eyebrow. \"And… why do you smell like strawberries?\" \"I took a shower.\" Percy's tone sounded slightly defensive. \"Okay.\" Brenda raised her hands in surrender. \"I won't judge.\" she smiled. \"I won't forget about this, though. Prepare to hear about this for the rest of your life.\" Percy groaned. \"Must you do this whenever something embarrassing happens to me?\" \"Yes, I must.\" Brenda socked his shoulder, smiling. \"I don't mean anything by it. You know that, right?\" Percy smiled back. \"Yes, I know.\" they arrived to the kitchen, and Percy grabbed a couple strawberries from his refrigerator. He washed them, then turned to face Brenda and pumped a fist into the air. \"Let's go teach yetis about strawberries!\" ... I apologize if the shower scene is not accurate, I have no idea if guys take showers way differently than girls do. I tried, though!

A small device that you pop into your ear, one big enough for a yeti's ear and one small enough for a human's. The device for the human highers the pitch so they hear the natural voice of the yetis, and the one for the yeti lowers the pitch so the yeti can hear their natural voice, and therefore understand each other\" Clark Lepine (tv host) says while being interviewed in the news. \"They even upgraded it so that they can call each other, by just pushing a button on the device.\" he added. Meanwhile, Percy had already introduced Migo to the device so they could communicate and call each other when they wanted, and Brenda and Meechee got one of their own as well. Therefore Percy decided to visit Migo. (The yeti had moved into a cave closer to the human village, to keep track of the smallfoot.) So Percy called Migo via the ear devices, and Migo answered it almost immediately. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, Migo!\" \"Percy! How are you doing?\" Migo said all excited to hear the smallfoot's voice again. \"I'm good. Though, I was wondering if I could come to your place for a visit?\" \"Of course, anytime!\" \"Great, I'll be right over.\" Percy said before hanging up. Migo couldn't wait to see the smallfoot again, so he decided to meet him at the foot of the mountain, just to see him a little earlier. Percy then spotted Migo waving to him halfway to his cave, \"Hi, Migo!\" \"Hey, Percy!\" Migo said while offering his hand to Percy so he could sit in the palm of Migo's hand, Percy then went to sit in his hand, and Migo carefully lifted him up to his shoulder. Migo and Percy walked back to the cave and talked for hours and hours about everything that had been going on since they last saw each other (which would be a few weeks). Suddenly, it was getting dark and Percy thought it was a good time to call it a day. \"Well, I guess I'll see you around.\" Percy said with a little disappointment in his voice. Until a huge blizzard came across, which Migo knew was way too windy and cold for Percy. \"Don't worry, you can stay here for the night.\" Migo said reassuringly. Percy smiled when he heard Migo say that, \"Thanks, big guy.\" Percy said. Percy also started getting tired, he brought his hand up to his mouth as he let out a yawn. And he was also freezing so he grabbed his winter hat from his backpack and put it on, he was still very cold though, Migo noticed that and began walking over to him. \"You okay, little guy?\" Migo asked as he picked Percy up in his hands before holding him against his chest. \"I'm f-fine, I-I'm just t-tired.\" Percy said while shivering like crazy. \"Here,\" Migo covered Percy all up in a warm blanket, so he would be kept warm. He also brought up one of his hands, and then gently rested it on the little guy's back to double the warmth. Percy let out an \"ahh\" as he felt the warmth spreading all around his body. \"Is that better?\" Migo asked as he was looking down at the smallfoot while smiling, and stroking his back gently with one finger. \"Yes, thank you.\" Percy said as he was practically glued to Migo's chest, no longer shivering. He slowly began to close his eyes and slip into sleep as Migo was quietly carrying him over to his bed (a rock) and lying down as gentle as possible trying not to wake him up. After he successfully got to lie down with Percy still being sound asleep, he carefully placed Percy on his chest, still covering him with the blanket and his hands. \"Don't worry, little guy.\" He whispered to sleeping Percy, patting his head gently with one finger, causing a smile to form on Percy's face. \"I'll keep you safe and warm here, okay?\" Migo was so happy knowing that the smallfoot slept so calmly and relaxed knowing Migo was holding him. And slowly, Migo began falling asleep as well. Hey guys, this is my first story so forgive me if something was wrong or it went a little too fast or confusing, I'm trying my best to make this a good story. Instead of making another chapter, I'll be making another story which will continue this story. I love Smallfoot, the humor, the emotion, the action, it was just great! Hope you liked it as well.

One afternoon, Feshikha wanders off into the forest while her parents and Taral weren't watching on a family outdoor picnic. Feshikha enters the woods and sees all kinds of animals such as racoons, mice, birds, deer, squirrels, rabbits, foxes, and chipmunks. She could hear them talk English around her and says hello as all the animals gather around her surprised to see a baby human talk their language and start being friendly to her to Feshikha's excitement. Suddenly, the animals notice something big approaching and all run away; leaving Feshikha behind in question. Feshikha sees a big shadow covering her and she turns around and looks up to see a huge old yeti stand in front of her looking down at her. The yeti noticed the little baby human could talk to other creatures talk so he smiles at her, kneels down and gestures her to step on his hand. She does and the yeti picks her up and grabs a small vial of a glowing blue potion from behind him and opens it and tells her to drink every last drop of it. Feshikha drinks all of it like it was a baby bottle. Afterwards, the yeti pulls of her winter coat and at that moment, her eyes start glowing a bright ice blue as the yeti realizes the potion taking effect and the \"blue powers\" are now inside of her and he tells her that it will help her fulfill her destiny to \"create a brighter future for all yetis\" in the future. Feshikha hears her mother calling and the yeti quickly slips her coat back on, puts back her down on the ground and tells her not to say anything and runs off hiding in the forest. Bilhana runs to her and tells Feshikha not to run off again then notices her eyes are glowing blue to her shock and asks what happened to her. Feshikha just smiles, laughs and hugs her mother as Bilhana looks behind Feshikha and sees large footprints in the snow suspecting that someone was here and did something to her daughter. The blue glowing in Feshikha's eyes fade away back to normal as Bilhana picks up her daughter in her arms and starts heading back to their outing area as Feshikha sees the yeti waving goodbye as he is climbing up a mountain with a circle of clouds above and she waves goodbye. Bilhana decides not to say anything about Feshikha's strange glowing blue eyes moment to Dhonu and keeps it to herself hoping to discover what it is someday as she noticed nothing has changed in Feshikha in her personality so the family returns to their home in a village just outside the city. As Feshikha grows older, she practices learning and controlling her blue powers in private with her elderly neighbor Kopisha, the the shaman woman of their village who is skilled with healing and has a pet Impeyan pheasant named Jadu who has a dislike for hugs. Feshikha also befriends a brown haired American boy named Danni Strider and is Feshikha's age; who recently moved into her village, but are outcast by other children and both become best friends and play together. Danni shows Feshilka his interest of filming with his father's camera. So Feshikha trusted Danni with her secret and shows him of her power to talk to animals and her blue powers which he helps her to control it, help her discover what she is capable of and make use of it for fun and useful things. They discover her capabilities of Telekinesis, Blue Lightning Bolts, Blue Fire, Blue Winds, Blue Illumination, Earth-manipulation, Blue Force-Fields, Blue Energy, Blue Water, Blue Ice, Healing and other powers yet to be discovered. Kopisha acts as a grandmother figure to Feshikha and Danni as well as continuing Feshikha's training of how to secretly use her powers wisely without anyone knowing. In her spare time, Feshikha is shown to have a love for a TV show called \"Percy Patterson's Wildlife\" and starts looking up to Percy and learns a lot about animals and behavior as it proved useful to her when she is out helping animals in situations of neglectful and bad humans with the help of her blue powers. Danni is on her side and helps in anyway he can as both kids have a goal to have a viral video someday about animals on the Internet. Feshikha will talk to any kind of animal they meet as Danni films of them having a conversation and learning things about each animal as they continue growing up together. During that time, Feshikha at 8 years old gained a new sister named Chimini. Main Story In winter 2018, 12 year-old Feshikha Usha is sleeping late until her 4 year-old sister Chimini wakes her by jumping on her until Feshikha gives up and gets out of bed. After Chimini leaves, Feshikha uses her powers to get dressed and ready for she was excited to finally meet her TV idol Percy Patterson who was in Nepal filming for a new episode and staying at the Yak Shack outside of her village. Her 16 year-old brother Taral leaves the house to meet up with some friends to go skiing while her father Dhonu leaves for work without saying goodbye to his family. Before Feshikha can leave, her mother Bilhana makes sure Feshikha eats her breakfast of tea, roti and vegetable/potato soup first, then Bilhana brushes and braids Feshikha's long brown hair and makes sure she is wearing appropriate winter-wear. Bilhana reminds Feshikha to be on her best behavior when she meets Percy and to never stray off the road because the Himalayas are dangerous; which Feshikha complies. Feshikha says goodbye to her mother and Chimini and runs off to get her best friend Danni Strider at his house. Danni was outside with his mother Kathryn waiting for Feshikha to arrive until she surprises him by throwing a snowball in his face, knocking him down to his unamusement. Kathryn says hi to Feshikha and compliments on her entrances. Feshikha helps Danni up on his feet and asks if he's ready to go meet Percy with her; which he is and suddenly smashes some snow in her face, getting even with her. So they both set off to the Yak Shack to meet Percy and start running down the snowy road. They both arrive and they see Percy preparing to film with a cameraman and his assistant Brenda. The children watch Percy from around the corner of the building as he, Brenda and the cameraman start filming a new episode of his show \"Percy Patterson's Wildlife\" with a rare Himalayan Jumping Spider on his arm. Percy tries faking a spider attack, which annoys Brenda as Feshikha is giggling while trying not to disrupt the filming. Brenda scolds Percy and reminds him their show is supposed to be educational, but Percy tells her that was why no one is watching his show and the cameraman agrees. Suddenly, the spider jumps from Percy's arm to the cameraman's nose, he screams, runs and slams into a wall and squashing the spider and falls down. That makes Feshikha and Danni laugh, which catches Percy's ear as they hide back in the corner. Percy is disappointed he didn't get it on footage, so he turns his attention to the two kids he suspects are spying on him and walks to their hiding spot behind the corner. Percy sees both children laughing at the footage Danni caught of the cameraman running into the wall on Danni's smartphone. Then Feshikha slips on an icy surface, falls over until Percy catches her in his arms. Feshikha looks at Danni with a shocked look on his face as he points to Percy. Feshikha stops laughing and looks up to see Percy holding her as she gasps that it's him in a flash. Percy smiles and says hello, lifts Feshikha on her feet and asks what they were doing at the Yak Shack. Feshikha lies by saying they were just playing and watching some funny animal videos on Danni's smartphone. But Percy wasn't buying it as he notices Feshikha hiding a magazine with his image on the cover behind her back realizing she is a fan of his. Percy tricks Feshikha to look behind her and snatches the magazine from her and tells her that he knows she is a fan of his show and asks her again why she and her friend are here; telling her to not dare lie to him again. Feshikha comes clean and tells him she really is a fan, she still watches his TV show and just wanted to finally meet him in person. Percy admires her honesty and offers to sign the cover for her, asking for her name and how to spell it. After signing the magazine, Percy notices another Himalayan Jumping Spider jump on Feshikha's arm and he watches her asking the spider if she is all right. Danni is filming on his smartphone as Feshikha is giving her sympathy to the spider, leaving Percy confused. As Percy gives Feshikha her magazine back, he questions her talking to the spider. She replies by telling him that she has Zoolingualism: the power to talk to animals like the book character Dr. Doolittle. She and Danni like to film videos of her talking to animals and talk about their thoughts and feelings in hopes one day to have a viral video on the internet. She also dreams to be like Percy because he inspired her to love animals and understand them well thanks to Percy's teachings on his show. Percy is touched by her story, but pretends to believe Feshikha about her power as he sarcastically asks what the spider said. Feshikha says the spider doesn't like him and that he and the cameraman squashed her mate and says they are \"stupid humans\" to Percy's disappointment; not expecting that kind of answer. The spider jumps off Feshikha's arm, lands on Percy's nose and hisses at him, and then jumps away in a huff. Percy ignores the spider and takes Feshikha out from the corner to the front of the Yak Shack where he was filming, pulls her to his side and takes a selfie with her on his smartphone and posts it online on his social media account with the caption \"My first local fan in the Himalayas\". Just then, a frantic pilot approaches them as Percy holds Feshikha close to him, protecting her as he tells them he was in a plane crash on the mountain and saw a yeti. Feshikha looked terrified as it is revealed she had a childhood fear of yetis but shook off that fear as she got older and started to get interested with the mythical creature secretly. She looks up at the mountain where a circle of clouds surrounds the top and is fascinated. Percy gets an idea, pretends to believe the pilot and offers to take him inside the Yak Shack to buy him a drink and hear all about it. Percy tells Feshikha he has to interview the pilot, thanks her for watching his show. He even offers her to come visit him again tomorrow and will possibly let her be on his show. Feshikha happily accepts and gives him a hug, unaware that he's going to use her to be famous again. Feshikha and Danni leave the Yak Shack and start their wayback to their neighborhood while Feshikha is in question about the pilot's yeti encounter. Danni asks her if she actually believes the crazy pilot and she answers that she wasn't sure because her village is famous for the most yeti sightings more than anywhere else in the world and believes the mountain with the circle of clouds where the pilot crashed is hiding a secret, waiting to be discovered someday. She confesses to Danni that she believes she may have seen a yeti as a toddler and he gave her some magical blue drink once but it was a long time ago. Danni tells her not to worry about it thinking that the crash affected the pilot's mentality as they pass a group of kids who tease them and call them mean names but they ignore it and move on despite their feelings were hurt. They decide to go have some fun and run off into the forest to their secret spot and Danni has her use her powers to see what else she can do with them as she creates a blue glowing orb from her hands and shoots it at a big rock, making a crack in it and shows off her other powers they discovered over the years knowing each other. Then she accidentally makes a blue fog bomb which doesn't hurt Danni but he couldn't see in front of him until the fog lifts and Feshikha is surprised. Danni types that power on his list of Feshikha's powers on his smartphone and compliments that it could be useful in case she was ever in danger and needs to make a diversion to escape. At sunset, they stop in front of Danni's house and both say goodbye as Feshikha starts heading for home back to her family. She shows off her autographed magazine to her mother and siblings except her father who is too busy on his phone to notice. Danni watches Feshikha run home and says hello to Kopisha as it is revealed that Danni have secret feelings for Feshikha. Kopisha sees that in Danni's eyes and encourages him to tell her how he feels about her, but Danni says he's too shy. Kopisha tells him that he'll find his courage somehow and he'll know what to tell her when the time comes and overcome his shyness and she heads back to her house. So Danni goes home thinking about her words as his father Joseph greets him. That evening at dinner, Feshikha tells her family about her experience with Percy and the crazy pilot as Bilhana encourages her to go visit Percy again as Taral compliments her as they're eating thukpa soup. But her stern workaholic Dhonu is in a bad mood because of his job as an attorney and something else was bothering him. Dhonu takes his stress out by asking his daughter why she does what he considers weird everyday. Feshikha is confused as she didn't understand what he means and he gets into an argument with her about her behavior at school such as drawing animals on paper during class and talking to animals outside of school since she has no friends to hang out with except for Danni. Feshikha argues she has done nothing wrong for she is doing good in school like turning in her completed homework on time and gets good grades and tests and she is pretty happy with what she does with helping animals and earning their trust with Danni and admits she wants to be like Percy Patterson to which her father would beg to differ. He tells her to start to put her ridiculous behavior behind her and start acting like a normal kid and tells her it's why she doesn't fit in or have any friends and it makes him look bad to everyone in the village. Feshikha is heartbroken at that remark and tells him there was so much more to her than he thinks and runs up to her room in tears as her mother Bilhana watches her in sympathy and scolds her husband for treating her like that. Dhonu tells Bilhana if Feshikha ever wants to succeed in the future, she needs to get her act together and grow up. Bilhana goes upstairs into Feshikha's room and finds her trying to hide her tears on her bed and holding her yeti doll she named Snowfluff. Bilhana sits by her side on her bed and tells her that her father didn't mean what he said. Feshikha asks her mom why he is embarrassed of her or why doesn't like it when she is around animals because it makes her happy helping them and wants him to be proud of her like he used to be as he is of Taral being in athletic programs at his high school. Bilhana tells Feshikha there is nothing wrong with her and if she wants to work with animals in the future like Percy, she should make it her dream, which makes Feshikha a little better and she tells her daughter she's going to make them both proud one day as she is proud of her. Bilhana also hopes one day her husband will be the loving father again as he once was before he became a hard working attorney and was too busy for his children and her. Feshikha smiles as her mother kisses her goodnight as Chimini enters Feshikha's room and hugs Feshikha. She smiles and kisses Chimini goodnight as Bilhana takes Chimini to her room to put her to bed and tells Feshikha not to worry about it anymore tonight for she will talk to him and tomorrow is a new day and leaves her room. Feshikha quietly goes outside her bedroom door and listens to her father going on about his problems at work as well as her odd behavior as Bilhana tells him don't talk down on his daughter, it will cause her to resent him and will want nothing to do with him in the future. She also tells him that Feshikha is doing fine in school with good grades, hanging out with Danni and interacting with animals and that it is what makes her happy. But he didn't care; he just wants her to stop her behavior to which Bilhana sighs out of disapproval as he considers Feshikha an embarrassment to him. Bilhana finally snaps and wants for the man she fell in love with, married and brought three beautiful children into the world together back. Then she turned and walked away from him in a huff, leaving him alone in the living room in silence. Feshikha feels sad again and goes back into her room and sits on her bed in front of her bedroom window next to her bed (with a metal balcony and stairs that goes down outside) and stares out in depression. Feshikha decides to look at the Himalayan Mountains through her telescope thinking it will take her mind off of it. Suddenly, Feshikha gets a glimpse of something big and white moving in the distance heading towards the Yak Shack. Curious, Feshikha wants to go out there to see what it is so she quietly dresses up in her winter clothes, packs her backpack of supplies and her pink winter sleeping bag (for she knew the Himalayas were dangerous). Feshikha hesitated for a moment at the thought of sneaking out after dark. But she wanted some excitement, so quietly sneaks out of her bedroom window while her family is asleep and climbs down the stairs to the ground. She quietly sneaks out of the village and started running to the Yak Shack to find the moving white figure. Feshikha arrives outside the Yak Shack and looks all around using her blue powers while nobody is around to find the moving big white figure but no luck. Thinking she must've been seeing things, she sits down by the wall at the empty outdoor terrace area still upset with her father. Feshikha feels a little tired so she grabs her sleeping bag from her backpack and gets in it to keep herself warm and dozes off in sleep by some garbage bags deciding not to go back home (at least not yet), unaware her powers attracted someone to her location. The moving white figure, which turned out to be a yeti named Migo quietly approached the Yak Shack and explores around the terrace area. He sees a goat eating a shoe by the garbage bags and he takes the shoe and puts it against his foot, realizing he was close to finding a \"smallfoot\". The goat approaches a sleeping Feshikha and tries to eat her backpack, which gets Migo's attention and moves closer to the pink bag. Migo looks down and realizes inside the pink bag, there was a little smallfoot sleeping on the ground in a \"pink cocoon\". Migo tries to push the goat away from her backpack while trying not to wake up Feshikha. It worked until the goat screams; which wakes up Feshikha and sees the goat with her backpack in his mouth. Without noticing Migo above her, she gets up and tells the goat to leave her backpack alone and to Migo's surprise, he could hear good clear English from this little smallfoot. Migo believes he made a discovery of a \"rare talking smallfoot\". Feshikha gets her backpack back by pulling in a tug-of-war and the goat lets go of the backpack as Feshikha falls over only for Migo to catch her with his finger and gently push her on her feet. She turns around and sees a chair behind her mistaking that it broke her fall. Feshikha gets a little suspicious she wasn't alone besides the goat, but she shrugs it off. Then she sees the shoe by her feet and tosses it to the goat to eat it and walks back to her spot and goes back to sleep in her sleeping bag still not noticing Migo watching her above. Migo curiously stares at Feshikha as he decides to take her back with him to his village and surprise the other yetis with a rare talking smallfoot. He lifts the end of her sleeping bag and the little smallfoot slides out into his enormous hand. He lifts her up as he stares at her still asleep in fascination saying to himself that's she's not the smallfoot he was looking for but she'll be perfect for communication to the yetis and not pass up this rare opportunity. Feshikha starts noticing something felt different underneath her as Migo walked away from her sleeping spot. She slowly wakes up and tries to get up, deciding it was time to go home before someone noticed. But she nearly falls off until Migo stopped and gently pushed her back with his fingers. Feshikha now fully awake realizes something wasn't right, she notices she was high up on something soft and big. She looks beneath her to see enormous white furry feet with blue toes on the ground and then notices she was on enormous blue hands and white furry arms and starts feeling scared. A male voice behind her says \"Hi little smallfoot.\" Feshikha feels more scared and feels her heart pounding. She slowly turns around to see a huge white yeti smiling at her. Feshikha stares at Migo, then quietly asked what he said. Migo says \"Hi little smallfoot\" again as she gasps in horror seeing a real yeti right before her eyes, hearing him speak like all other animals, finally realizing what the big white moving figure really was and that he found her instead. Migo hears the door to the Yak Shack open and he turns and sees Percy walking outside, talking on his smartphone only to hear squeaks and chirps unlike with Feshikha hearing good clear English from her. Migo quietly approaches Percy with Feshikha in his hand as Percy is leaving a message for Brenda to help him. Just then, Percy sees enormous feet in front of him and looks up to see Feshikha in a yeti's hand while the yeti is smiling at him. Thinking it was Brenda in a yeti costume, he is excited to start filming his show with the yeti and will use Feshikha as a kidnapping victim for his show as he remembered her from earlier. Feshikha is unsure of what Percy is talking about but she tries to tell Percy that the yeti was real but Percy ignores her as he trying to figure out where to film. Migo tries telling Percy his name but Percy can only hear growling noises. Percy thinks Brenda in the yeti suit put an amplifier in there and compliments \"her\" as Feshikha facepalmed in frustration. Percy starts filming himself acting scared with his smartphone then turns his phone on Migo and pretends to be surprised that there was a yeti right by him and that he has kidnapped a little girl. Feshikha starts feeling exasperated as Percy then tells \"Brenda\" to do the growl. Then Migo puts Feshikha down and she runs behind Percy in fear to his confusion. Percy and Feshikha hear the real Brenda leaving on a snowmobile and that's when Percy realizes Feshikha was telling the truth about the yeti and he starts to get scared too and thinks the yeti really did kidnap Feshikha. Migo tries talking to Percy but Percy could still only hear growls while Feshikha could hear Migo's words clearly. Percy screams and picks up Feshikha and tries to run in the Yak Shack but Migo jumps in their way. Percy runs the other way only to accidentally trip on a wooden box dropping Feshikha in the process and his tranquilizer dart gun falls out of his backpack. Feshikha, trying not to use her blue powers in front of Percy, grabs her backpack with her hands and runs for cover behind some black garbage bags against the wall. Migo has Percy cornered as she hears him explain that he needs to take both of them home with him and prove he exists and show his discovery of Feshikha's talking ability so he can get un-banished. But Feshikha was terrified at the idea of being kidnapped by a yeti as she heard scary stories about \"yetis kidnapping people and were never seen again\" her whole life and realizes he wants to kidnap Percy too. Percy manages to retrieve his gun from the goat and tries to fire at Migo but Migo tilts the gun up and Percy shoots up. Percy tries to run away but is grabbed by Migo and slips out of his hands landing on top of Migo trying to get away from him as Migo thinks he was playing with him. Feshikha watches in shock as Migo was tickled and the dart fell down into Percy's butt and he falls off of Migo unconscious. Migo tries to wake Percy but no luck and accidentally knocks out one of his teeth. As Percy is unconscious, Migo stuffs him into his sleeping bag and straps him to his chest with climbing rope and prepares to go back home. As Migo is leaving, he suddenly realized he forgot about Feshikha, so he goes back and grabs Feshikha's pink sleeping bag and starts approaching her hiding spot for Feshikha, apologizes and asks her if she's ready to go. But to his surprise, she's gone because she secretly snuck away and ran off while Migo was distracted. He desperately looks for her all around the Yak Shack area for some clue until he sees small footprints in the snow heading up a road and starts to follow them. Meanwhile, Feshikha is fearfully running up the empty snowy road looking back to make sure the yeti wasn't following her. She runs back into her village, approaches her house and climbs up the stairs on the metal balcony to her bedroom window. Feshikha does one more check to make sure the yeti didn't follow her trail. Thinking she was safe, she opens her window and enters her room onto her bed and tucks herself under the covers and closes the window quietly. As Feshikha is breathing heavily out of being tired from running, Bilhana enters her room asking her if she was all right. Bilhana notices her daughter is sweating and guesses that Feshikha had a bad nightmare and assures her she will be ok. Feshikha goes along with it as she mentions she looked through her telescope and saw something big and white approaching the village. Bilhana jokingly tells her that she looks like she's seen a yeti. Feshikha freaks out and looks out the window thinking the yeti was outside but Bilhana calms her down and didn't mean to scare her and says it could've been anything she saw. Feshikha calms down as Bilhana tells her daughter to go back to sleep to help her feel better and not stress about her father as Bilhana kisses her, leaves and closes her door. Feshikha smiles and takes a few more deep breaths, closes her eyes and goes to sleep still in her winter clothes; thinking she escaped the yeti and was safe at last. Or so she thought; fate had other plans for Feshikha. Unknown to her, Migo was drawing nearer to Feshikha's whereabouts following her footprints in the snow, which led him to a house in a village. Migo sees the tracks led past some houses, to a little metal staircase and looks up in front of him to see a window in a house. Migo looks inside and sees Feshikha asleep below the window in her bed, relieved he has found her at last. Migo quietly opens her window and reaches his fingers inside and lifts up the covers off of her. Migo has a moment of hesitation, but he was determined to bring Feshikha back with him along with Percy to prove the smallfoot's existence and have her translate for both species. Migo gently lifts Feshikha in his fingers and carries her outside the house into his hand. Then he remembered her backpack and reached back in the house only to accidentally knock over her telescope and grabs the backpack and ties it to the climbing rope on his back. Then he stuffs Feshikha in her sleeping bag and straps it behind his shoulder like a backpack as Migo says to her that he hoped she didn't mind, but he is taking her home and he starts his way back to the yeti village on top of the mountain. Feshikha wakes up from the sound of someone talking excitedly and suddenly realized she wasn't in her room anymore. She looks out of the sleeping bag hole to see her home disappearing as Migo kept moving further away from the village to the mountain; realizing the yeti found her and she's been kidnapped. She reaches out her arm and calls for her mother, but to no avail. Feshikha drops back in the bag upset and scared, not knowing what to do now since she has never been away from her home and family. Still inside the sleeping bag trying to calm down, Feshikha pops out to get a look of where she was being taken. To her shock, she finds herself strapped behind Migo's shoulder and looks over him to find herself in the mountain wilderness while Migo is whistling happily as he strolled up the mountain. She attempts to escape again by grabbing a pine tree branch as Migo walked by the big tree and pulls herself out of the bag. Then she climbs up the tree, hides in the branches near the top and waited until Migo was gone then she will climb down and make a run for it. But it didn't take long for Migo to notice that she was gone again and retraces his steps back to find her but he has no luck while Feshikha tries to remain very quiet as possible. Migo stood and thought of possibilities she could've done while he was walking up the mountain until it finally clicked and gets an idea. He starts to walk past the pine tree and says to himself that he gives up and guesses that she got away and starts to leave to Feshikha's relief. Or so it seemed; without warning, Migo knocks the tree she was hiding in causing her to fall down into his hands. Migo is happy he found her again but tells her not to run off as he brushed the pine needles from her hair and clothes. Then he puts her back in her bag, tightened the rope around her a little and continued up the mountain to her dismay. Then she and Migo notice a blizzard coming in front of them then she ducks back down in the bag as Migo is blown into a cave and she gets loose from Migo's shoulder. Looking out of her sleeping bag hole, she decides to hop out of the cave while Migo is distracted trying to thaw a frozen Percy. As Migo gathers some sticks to start a fire to revive him, he catches a glimpse of Feshikha in her sleeping bag trying to hop out of the cave. She almost makes it outside, about to be blown away by the storm until Migo stops and grabs her at the last moment and takes her back in the cave and sternly reminds her not to run away. As she struggles to get herself free from Migo's clutches, he hangs her in her bag on a tall stick by some big rocks like a backpack stand so she won't run away again as he reminds himself to keep a close eye on her. After a while, Feshikha manages to get herself out of the bag to see Percy strapped to a spitfire stick over a fire. Percy manages to get himself free and catches Feshikha when she fell out of her bag and puts her on his back while filming Migo and guessing that he wants them for dinner. Feshikha could hear Migo saying he's almost finished with their sleeping area and almost drying out their \"cocoons\". Percy runs further into the cave with Feshikha on his back and tries to send a video message on his phone to Brenda despite his frozen fingers and both notice a blue light reflect on his phone and looks to find it but it disappeared so he shrugs it off. He texts Brenda to upload the video and send for help but fails to Percy's frustration as he yells out. At that moment, they hear a growling sound and they come across an angry bear roaring in Percy's face as Feshikha hides behind him. Both humans try to run back but are stopped by Migo as Feshikha points at the bear, but she accidentally shoots a small blue bolt from her finger hitting the bear's nose like a static shock. The bear angrily stands up as Migo settles the bear down as Percy grabs Feshikha into his arms as the bear is yelling at Migo for almost waking her husband and her kids. Feshikha holding onto Percy listens to their conversation as Migo lifts his foot and pushes them behind him then hand-signals them to run. It was that moment that Feshikha realizes that Migo truly meant no harm to her and Percy. Percy carries Feshikha in his arms runs out of the cave after the storm passes as Migo goes after them. When they both make it out of the cave, they both hear a snap behind in the cave and hear Migo crying in pain because his toe was caught in a bear trap. Percy takes pity, but he turns to look down to the Yak Shack and Feshikha's village. But Feshikha also takes pity on Migo and tells Percy that they should help him but Percy says they shouldn't and must go home. But she explained he wasn't trying to eat them, he was warming them up away from the storm and that he saved them from the mother bear. Percy reluctantly agrees after seeing Feshikha's sad face and both run back in the cave. They remove the bear trap from his toe with a brief moment of Feshikha's blue powers as Migo passes out from the sight of a little drop of blood. Migo wakes to see Percy and Feshikha bandaging his toe with duct tape together; Migo smiles at Percy and Feshikha in gratitude. Migo notices the storm lifted and asks them if they're ready to go up the mountain and prove they exist. Percy is confused by his growling noises while Feshikha doesn't know what he's talking about but she tells Migo that Percy can't hear him talk but she can and encourages him to use hand-signals like has Feshikha act as a translator to Percy as he is filming Migo signing and Feshikha translating his words to which he was finally convinced that Feshikha really could talk to animals including yetis. She tells Percy that Migo wants them to come with him up the mountain. Percy decides he will go despite it was a brave or stupid decision and is stuffed in his sleeping bag again with some hot stones to keep him warm. Migo notices Feshikha is gone again and he steps outside to see Feshikha standing over the edge, looking at her home debating if she should let Migo take her away. Migo picks her up and reminds her not to run away and this time, he makes her promise him that she won't do it again. She agrees and finally accepts that she can't escape from Migo no matter what she does. Percy peeks from his sleeping bag and films on his phone Feshikha talking to Migo like she can actually understand him. After Migo calls her \"Little Smallfoot\" again, she finally tells Migo her name is \"Feshikha\", not \"Little Smallfoot\" and enunciates how to say her name. Migo introduces himself and questioned how she could understand him and Percy can't. She explained her power to Migo, helping him understand that her kind can't hear animals or yetis talk their language but she can. Migo explained that she will be the perfect link to communication between yetis and smallfoots; which he tells her that it was what the yetis call her species. Migo asks why she kept trying to run away, but Feshikha tells him she was trying to go home. But Migo tells her that he can't let her do that right now so Feshikha asks why he kidnapped her and Percy. Migo explains that he was banished from his village by the chief for telling them he saw a smallfoot after he saw a shiny flying thing fall from the sky (which made Feshikha realize the crazy pilot was telling the truth) and needs to bring one back as proof. While he was searching, he found her and discovered that she can talk. So he decided to bring her too as a translator to Percy and yetis and just couldn't pass up a rare opportunity. Feshikha tells him that she really doesn't know but Migo tells her that he really needs her and he'll do anything to convince her. After few moments of thinking, she hesitantly agrees to go with Migo. But on one condition: once he introduces them to his village, he must bring Percy back to the Yak Shack and her back to her house in the village as she explained she has a family. Migo is understanding what Feshikha wants so he promises he will bring them home after he gets un-banished, thus making a deal and both shake on it. Migo grabs her sleeping bag, puts her back in it and puts some hot stones in the bag to keep her warm. Migo starts running and jumping up the mountain as Feshikha climbs out of the bag onto Migo's shoulder, holding on to his fur and watches in awe of her surroundings as Migo starts jumping and climbing into the clouds. Feshikha starts falling asleep on his shoulder and Migo gently puts her back into her sleeping bag and he barely catches a glimpse of something glowing blue from her eyes. But he shrugs it off, thinking he was seeing things and continues up the mountain. The next morning, Feshikha is still asleep in her sleeping bag and hears four new voices and then feels strange movements that something very big was holding and squeezing her until Migo tells the four voices to be easy on him for he has two creatures. Then he grabs Feshikha who was about to wake up to the movements and voices but feels nervous and closes her eyes hoping it all a dream. A female voice asks Migo what are those until Migo tells the group to \"meet their mystical creatures.\" Then he puts Percy in his bag on a rock, then places Feshikha in her bag on the rock next to him, as the four voices lock their eyes on Percy struggling to get out of his sleeping bag. Feshikha wakes up after Migo taps her a few times and tells her to wake up and come out. After taking a deep breath, she gets herself out of her sleeping bag, on her knees and looks up to see four huge yetis surrounding and smiling at her and Percy with another scared look on her face and gasped. Feshikha timidly hides behind Percy until Migo assures her that it was ok and they're his best friends. She looks up and hears each yeti saying, \"I knew they were real\", \"no one's gonna think I'm crazy anymore with twice the proof\", \"he's so beautiful and she's so adorable\" and \"she's shorter than the other one\". Percy and Feshikha stand up and are fascinated with the discovery of the yeti squad called the S.E.S.(Smallfoot Evidentiary Society), as Feshikha remains quiet, trying not to startle them as Percy takes another selfie with Feshikha. Percy notices that Feshikha is awfully quiet but then he remembered why. Migo notices Feshikha's silence so he picks up Feshikha and tells the four yetis that Feshikha is a rare kind of smallfoot he discovered while he was down there. The yetis look at Feshikha in question, then the female leader asks Migo why he thinks she's rare. Migo was about to tell them but then he decided to have Feshikha show them why instead to her shock. He puts her back down and tells Feshikha to show them why she's so special but she is unsure what to say as the four yetis lock their eyes on her. Percy figures out what the yeti was saying so he starts filming and encourages her to speak to them. One of the yetis named Fleem takes a close look at her and doubts that she's special but he is scolded by the other three yetis; then he says she's just a \"little squirt\". After some quick thinking, Feshikha takes the moment and leaps towards the four yetis on the rock and shouts out loud, \"And I talk too!\" The four yetis gasp in shock and jump back as Feshikha laughs really hard at the looks on their faces that she falls on the rock on her back as Percy and Migo laugh too. The four yetis are astounded by Migo's discovery of a rare talking smallfoot. They approach Feshikha with fascination, the female leader picks her up and observes her, wondering how it was possible for a smallfoot to talk as the other two touch and look at her guessing it was her \"pelt\" or her \"horn\". Migo tells them it was a power she was born with to speak to all kinds of creatures. Migo introduces each yeti to Feshikha: Meechee the lavender braided beautiful yeti, Gwangi the biggest purple curly yeti, Kolka the pink pony-tailed yeti and Fleem the shortest skinniest yeti. Meechee asks for Feshikha's name so she introduces herself and Percy to the yetis as Meechee puts her back down. Fleem picks up Percy and starts acting scary and puts him down and says he's just trying to establish dominance, as Feshikha looks at him unamused and asks if that was really necessary. Kolka says they welcome the smallfoots with open arms but accidentally knocks Percy off the rock and Feshikha hops off to help him up but Kolka picks him up and hugs him tightly. Feshikha backs away from the yetis and turns around to finally get a beautiful sight of the top of the mountain above the clouds for the first time. As she is staring up the mountain, big purple fingers wrap around her and is picked up by Gwangi. He smiles and hugs Feshikha against his cheek like a little kitten and gives her the nickname \"small fry\". Feshikha realizes that the five yetis want to be her friends so she decides to accept their friendship as Gwangi walks back to the group. Percy asks Feshikha if he's squeezing her to death like he thinks he is by Kolka and she tells him no, Kolka is adoring him and the yeti holding her is nothing but a gentle giant to Gwangi's excitement and both laugh. She is placed on his right shoulder as he holds Percy next as Gwangi tells the group that they're going to bring Percy and Feshikha to their village and blow their tiny minds with Meechee agreeing that it was time to wake the village up. As the yetis make their way to the yeti village, Feshikha sitting on Gwangi's shoulder asks the yetis what was going on. Then, she is grabbed by Meechee and she hides her pink sleeping bag on Migo's shoulder and tells her that they wanna surprise the village with her and tells her to be quiet just for a while. The five yetis gather everyone under a tree and Migo holds up Percy and Feshikha, pops off one of her boots and Percy's, and finally gets a view of all the yetis looking at her and Percy in awe. Feshikha and Percy are astounded by the sight of the yeti village and the yetis all around them, then the S.E.S yetis signal Feshikha to talk. So she says hello to all the yetis, standing on Migo's hand and all the yetis are in shock to hear a little smallfoot talk their language. Feshikha notices an elder yeti next to the ice palace wearing a robe of stones asking what was going on. Migo shows him that he brought two smallfoots but Stonekeeper denies they are smallfoots and that she and Percy are hairless yaks and gets a little scared of him. Feshikha whispers to Percy that he's their leader and doesn't seem friendly but if necessary, she'll do all the talking. Meechee grabs Feshikha in her hand and tells her father that she is a rare smallfoot and Feshikha proves it by asking Stonekeeper why he wears a \"dress made of rocks\" and it's not good for his backbone. Gwangi, Kolka and Fleem try to hold their laughter hearing that remark from the little smallfoot. Stonekeeper tells Meechee to give the two creatures to him and he'll take them inside the palace to determine what they are but Feshikha gets suspicious and tells him \"no\" as Meechee assures her that she won't give her to her Dad. All the yetis gather around Migo and start asking questions about Percy and Feshikha to the Stonekeeper's disappointment. Feshikha reminds Migo of the deal since she and Percy did their part so now Migo needs to do his. Migo assures her that he remembers the deal, but Meechee and the other yetis don't want Feshikha and Percy to leave just yet. Meechee tells her that she and the other yetis have so many questions that Feshikha could answer and translate for Percy; all the yetis nod eagerly in agreement. After hesitating, Feshikha decides that she and Percy could spare some time to the yeti's delight. Feshikha is placed down on a rock along with Percy as the yetis surrounding her and touching her and asking her questions. Feshikha starts to get hungry so the yetis start offering her to try their food much to Feshikha's hesitation as the food was rock fruits and snow pops but eats some anyway as they were better than nothing. Feshikha is perched on Meechee's shoulder and she is shown to all the yetis and saying hello to them, trying to learn everyone's names and answering as much questions as she can. Some yetis dig through her backpack looking at all her supplies including matches, water bottles, a whistle, rope, emergency first aid and food kits, winter blanket, a book containing her favorite stories including fairy tales, a family picture and her yeti doll Snowfluff. Feshikha even opens her autographed magazine and shows them inventions and the wonders of her world that they start copying human ways such as music, sports, flying kites, hang-gliding, bicycling, art, etc. to Feshikha's excitement. Meechee takes Feshikha for a ride around the village on the ice block lift but Feshikha gets splashed by hot water off the ice block, falls down all wet and starts freezing briefly until suddenly to her surprise doesn't feel cold anymore until Meechee picks her up and warms her up in her fur and takes her to her room in the ice palace and puts her in a little hot bath and dries out her clothes for her. Later, Meechee takes Feshikha snow sliding down the mountain with Migo and Percy but they crash as Feshikha and Percy fall of their yetis and laugh, then they turn around to see a mammoth freaking out and jumping over them but luckily the humans weren't squashed. Meechee grabs Feshikha and Migo grabs Percy as Meechee tames her mammoth named Blossom to Feshikha's amazement as Blossom takes a liking to Percy and Feshikha. Percy takes pictures of him and Feshikha; then they are both are on a hill with some Yeti Childrenas both humans are bonding together with the yetis as they are learning about the yeti civilization. Later, a yeti child named Soozieapproaches Feshikha with her storybook so Feshikha decides to introduce the yetis to fairy tales and starts reading to them of her favorite ones with good morals and life lessons to the yeti's delight. As Percy and Feshikha are surrounded by yeti children looking through their bags at their possessions, Percy starts noticing a small blue glow in Feshikha's eyes as she uses telekinesis to grab a water bottle to drink and begins to think that Feshikha is hiding something from him and the yetis. Feshikha is exhausted from all the yetis questioning her and observing her she decides to take a break alone until Gwangi approaches Percy and Feshikha with a toilet paper roll as Kolka asks them to translate it calling it \"the scroll of invisible wisdom\". Feshikha laughs very hard she falls to the ground to the yeti's confusion as Percy goes behind a snow hill to do his \"business\". Fleem watches in disgust and she laughs even more until a blue light starts glowing from Feshikha's hand to Gwangi, Kolka and Fleem's shock. Kolka asks Feshikha what that was, but Feshikha quickly hides her hand behind her back and says she doesn't know what she's talking about. Gwangi tells her not to keep secrets from her friends and she can trust them. But Feshikha fears if she shows the yetis her powers, they will think she is a monster and turn on her. So Feshikha fakes her tummy hurting and has to do her \"business\", so she runs off with Percy tailing behind her. As Feshikha is making distance from the yetis away from the yeti village, Percy runs up to her and asks her if she's ok. Feshikha tells him she's fine and just needs a break from the yetis. Percy decides to take a break with Feshikha as he decides to get to know her better since they are both on the mountain together. They walk together as they both tell each other about themselves as Feshikha talks about her family and how her father thinks she is an embarrassment to him, which Percy confesses out of sympathy that his father is ashamed of him. Both Percy and Feshikha realize they both have so much in common they really start to become closer friends. Percy decides to tell her the truth about his show failing, he is broke, is at risk of losing his house and he thought faking a yeti sighting was going to save his show and solve his problems, but he lost the trust of his assistant Brenda and would've lost fans including Feshikha. Feshikha is shocked that Percy would do such a thing, but forgives him when she realizes he didn't do it. Feshikha is reluctant to get even with secrets and just admits she is different from everyone in the village. Percy asks her why she was different, but she tells him that if she told him why, he will think she's a monster. Percy is confused why she would think that as he promises her he won't and she has his word as he remembered that brief moment with the water bottle. Feshikha reluctantly gives in and they sit down on rocks as Feshikha starts using her hands as a blue glow forms as Percy watches in shock. Then she creates a blue flame and lights some sticks on fire, then she makes blue lightning bolts and then moves some rocks with telekinesis. Percy is shocked as Feshikha's eyes were glowing blue, then fades after showing her powers. Percy asks her how long she has had those powers, Feshikha answers that she thinks she was cursed as a baby by a yeti who gave her a blue drink. Then she has a flashback of herself as a toddler drinking a blue potion she received from a mysterious old yeti and she hears the words, \"fulfill your destiny for the future of all yetis,\" finally realizing that it wasn't a dream at all. Percy believes her since he knows yetis are real now and is now convinced magic is real. Feshikha confesses that he is the third person she ever told, the first being Kopisha the shaman woman of her village and her best friend Danni. Feshikha also tells him that she fears that if everyone finds out, they will regard her as a monster. Percy calms her and tells her she is never a monster and that he is actually amazed with her to Feshikha's surprise and promises her that he'll keep her powers a secret. Percy asks her if her family knows, and she tells them they don't and that she's been keeping her secret from them for the past 10 years, which she is torn with the decision to tell them or not. Percy admits to Feshikha that he sees potential in her and he is thinking about taking her on as his apprentice for his TV show. Feshikha feels better and expresses her joy hearing that wonderful news, thanks him and gives him a hug. Suddenly, Feshikha realizes Gwangi, Kolka, Fleem and Meechee were watching the whole time as she and Percy stand up and faces them. Feshikha nervously asks them how much they've seen and heard. Meechee tells her that they've seen and heard enough and now know Feshikha's secret of her powers. Feshikha begs them not to be afraid of her, she will never harm them or anyone. The yetis calm her down and Meechee tell her they are not afraid of her, in fact they are fascinated and want to learn more about her powers later. Feshikha is surprised as the yetis take both humans back to the yeti village. Then Meechee takes Percy and Feshikha into the ice palace. Meanwhile, Stonekeeper watches Feshikha in suspicion as he noticed her power to talk to animals and notices a small blue glow in her eyes, realizing she has the blue powers and another power she doesn't even know about, thus realizing what she really is. Stonekeeper takes Migo into the palace to reveal the truth about smallfoots which are really called humans and the lies the village all lived upon to protect yetis from humans as he deemed them monsters for almost committing a genocide that the remaining yetis climbed the mountain where they knew humans couldn't survive for the yeti's safety. Migo says his smallfoot and Feshikha are not monsters, but Stonekeeper asks Migo when he found them if they greeted him with open arms; making Migo realize that Percy wasn't playing, he was trying to attack him. But with Feshikha he remembered that she didn't attack him but Stonekeeper revealed she is hiding her darkest secret from everyone. Stonekeeper explained that Feshikha is a young human with a rare gift of animal communication and she also possessed the \"Blue Powers\" from a rare powerful substance and \"Aerial Adaptation\". He tells Migo that 10 years ago, an old crazy yeti committed treason to the village when he went below the clouds with a strange little blue potion he concocted with a rare blue substance he deemed too dangerous and was about to confiscate it but he gave it to a baby smallfoot so that when the baby smallfoot was ever high up in the mountains in their village someday, her eyes will glow blue, which symbolizes either she uses her blue powers for certain things and will become immune to high altitude sickness and can survive high places with little or no oxygen and extreme cold temperatures. Stonekeeper found out about it and banished the old yeti from the village and the yeti shortly passed away during his exile. Stonekeeper tells Migo that Feshikha is the baby smallfoot the yeti gave the potion to thus making Migo realize the blue glow in the distance near the Yak Shack, the blue static shock in the cave and the brief flash of blue light from her eyes he caught of a glimpse of the other night was real. Stonekeeper considers her dangerous to the village despite that she was a child so after the old yeti's passing, he secretly wrote a new stone about \"the baby smallfoot with glowing blue eyes\" saying if he should ever happen upon the baby smallfoot someday which was today, he will keep Feshikha from ever returning to the smallfoot village including her family below the clouds, which he thanks Migo for unknowingly finding and bringing him the baby smallfoot with glowing blue eyes after 10 long years of not knowing what she looked like or where she lived because he was secretly looking for her all this time. Stonekeeper also reveals the clouds are created from a secret steam machine to keep humans from looking up and yetis from looking down as curiosity is a stronger fear than fear itself and not let humans commit a second genocide so he wants Migo to lie to the village about the smallfoots to protect the village. Migo is so depressed and sad on an impulse decision he is about to make out of fear. In Meechee's room, Feshikha draws on Meechee's wall pictures depicting her life about her family, Danni, Kopisha and her village. Meechee asks Feshikha if her family are rare talking smallfoots just like her but Feshikha tells her that she doesn't really know but they don't know about her powers. But Meechee tells her that either way, she and the S.E.S want to meet Danni, Kopisha and her family one day including Chimini. Meechee surprises Feshikha with a present of a little gemstone necklace that Meechee made just for her as Feshikha expresses that she loves it and will treasure it always and both hug. Percy is drawing pictures about his world on Meechee's wall as he confesses he only cared about how many people watched his show and how popular he was when he remembered that animals were his true passion and thanks Feshikha for still believing in him. He shows Meechee and Feshikha a drawing of a lion and he projects a real lion on Meechee's wall, as Meechee is curious about the smartphone. Percy and Feshikha are put on Meechee's bed and they play candy crush with Meechee on Percy's smartphone projected on the wall of Percy's drawings. Feshikha notices Percy was more colder, his breathing was off and started turning pale. Feshikha realized that humans cannot survive high altitude but to her surprise, she was not experiencing the same symptoms, still breathing normally and not feeling as horribly cold as Percy was thus realizing the glowing blue eyes was not just her powers, but was a new power from the same potion she drank that's taking effect which is protecting Feshikha from the high altitude. Migo runs in and looks at Feshikha's glowing blue eyes in shock and the drawings on Meechee's wall thus confirming the Stonekeeper's truth about Feshikha. Feshikha tells Percy to hang on as she puts her hand on his forehead, unexpectedly releasing a blue glow into his head, to her and both yeti's confusion as it relieved Percy of his symptoms but was still very weak. Then she tells Meechee that Percy is experiencing high altitude sickness which humans get from being too high up from ground level without oxygen and tells Meechee that she needs to take her and Percy home right now or he'll die. But Migo takes Percy from the bed and refuses after looking at the drawings and Feshika's glowing eyes which Feshikha is shocked to hear Migo refusing to take them home. Migo tries to grab Feshikha but she uses her blue telekinesis to move Meechee's belongings and little blue force fields in front of him blocking his grabs and she runs to Meechee and lets her grab her and hides Feshikha behind her back to protect her from Migo as both girls realize something was up when she hears Meechee's older brother Thorp gathering everyone for an announcement from Migo and Stonekeeper. Meechee asks what's going and Migo tells her to stop asking questions and starts to head outside and tells Meechee that she can't protect Feshikha for long to Feshikha's horror hearing him say that. Feshikha tells Meechee she is scared but Meechee assures her that she will protect her no matter what happens. Meechee heads outside hiding Feshikha behind her, Migo says to all the yetis that Feshikha and Percy are a new breed of hairless yaks he found in a cave in the clouds and it was all a lie and to stop asking questions. Feshikha is horrified as Gwangi comes up and tells the village that Migo is lying and that there is a machine below them. Migo quickly says he's joking and he is crazy and calls the S.E.S \"weirdos\" which greatly offends Gwangi and the others. Feshikha comes out of hiding from Meechee with her eyes still glowing blue to everyone's surprise and announced in front of the whole village about Migo kidnapping her and the deal that she and Migo made about taking her and Percy back to her village to her family below the clouds which everyone gasps, even Migo's father Dorgle. Migo betrays Feshikha by denying the promise, there is no village and tells her to stop talking to Feshikha's horror with a tear running down her face as she is backing away from the yetis in fear. Stonekeeper tells her to come with him quietly as she notices that he is holding a stone with an image of a small human with blue glowing eyes, realizing Stonekeeper knew something about the blue potion she drank as a toddler and obtained her powers and another power she never knew about. So she angrily tells Stonekeeper that he knows where her powers came from and demanded answers but he denies her claims. As Gwangi angrily leaves Migo with Kolka and Fleem, Feshikha sees Percy taken away by Stonekeeper and gives him to Thorp and is put in an ice box and sends Thorp to seize her. Realizing what they were going to do to her, Feshikha angrily clutches her hand with blue bolts crackling, thus scaring Thorp away from her. Then Feshikha jumps down the stairs, walks a few feet, turns around and retaliates by telling Migo that she never should've taken pity on him, he is not her friend and he and Stonekeeper are lying, heartless monsters. Feshikha uses her blue powers to create blue flames and wind and creates a blue fog explosion without hurting anyone as she learned the other day. The blue fog lifts and Feshikha is gone, because she is secretly running away from the yeti village outside the entrance and disappears in the distance with tears running down her face, which Meechee gets a glimpse of. Gwangi, Kolka and Fleem look where Meechee was looking at Feshikha running away as they are relieved to see her unharmed but Gwangi feared she won't last the night out there alone. The yetis look at the spot she stood in sympathy (for they all grew to love her for her kindness and wisdom even Dorgle grows worried for her) as Gwangi, Kolka and Fleem decide to abandon Migo for his betrayal and leave the village to go find and help Feshikha. Meechee hopes they will find Feshikha before she gets hurt or even worse die, and Stonekeeper banishes Meechee to her room. Thorp was about to go find and capture Feshikha but Stonekeeper stops him and tells her to let her go, the mountain wilderness will kill her or make her return to the village saying that he'll let her choose to die out there alone or come back to surrender herself just to keep the village safe. Meechee grows horribly worried for Feshikha and hopes the S.E.S will find her in time as she walks into the palace very angry with Migo. Migo feels horribly guilty for his actions, as he grows worried about Percy ill and imprisoned and Feshikha being all alone outside the village with no chance of surviving. That evening before the sun was completely gone, Feshikha is trying to get as far away as she could away from the yeti village out in the wilderness using her powers to help her climb up snow hills. Feshikha felt it was safe enough to let out her tears of Migo's betrayal of breaking his promise and that her life was now in danger. Then she remembered the way to the stone ledge on the ice cliff she saw from earlier and started her way there. She reaches the stone ledge where the clouds surrounded the mountain but desperately tries to find a safe way down since she doesn't know how Migo got down the mountain or how far it was to her home. Feeling like she's trapped on the mountain forever and will never get home, she sits down by the stone ledge and breaks down crying; missing her family, friends and home. Feshikha remembers her final moments with her mother before she left for the Yak Shack, now regretting her decision to leave home in the first place. After some time passed, Feshikha barely hears a sound of someone calling her name several times in the distance. She feared the yetis were picking up her trail and tries to find somewhere to hide. Then Feshikha sees a rope tied to a rock and saw it hang over the ice cliff. Feshikha decided to try to climb down using the rope so she hangs on the rope and starts to slide down into the clouds but reached the harness at end of the rope and wasn't even long enough to reach the bottom of the mountain. Feshikha drops on the harness, but was out of options and wasn't sure to do next since she is out of breath and her heart was pounding faster than normal. Then she hears 3 familiar voices calling her name, coming closer above her and tries to stay very quiet as possible despite feeling exhausted from running and sliding down the rope into the clouds for a little girl like her. A familar female voice calls from above, asking her if she's down there. Then Feshikha looks up, but realizes too late the yetis caught a brief blue light from her eyes in the clouds and hears a familiar deep male voice calling her to hang on tight and feels something pulling her back up the mountain, out of the clouds. She is barely holding on for her life as she looked up to see Gwangi's big arms pulling her up towards him. He pulls Feshikha up to safety as she lets go at the last moment out of exhaustion; but luckily Gwangi catches her in his hand as she fell unconscious. Desperate to save her, he tries to warm her up with a few breaths and pressed her into his soft fur and then darkness fell on her as he clutched her into his hand and was being taken away once again. The three yetis take Feshikha to a hidden area on the mountain to hide her from Stonekeeper and Thorp as Kolka sets up camp, Fleem kept a look out and Gwangi keeping Feshikha warm and hidden in his hand. That night, Feshikha slowly starts to open her eyes, feeling warm in front of a big campfire the yetis made just for her. Feshikha coughs as she wakes up and looked around to find herself in Gwangi's hand as she sees Kolka and Fleem sitting around the fire in a different part of the mountain, all of them heartbroken as she was. They are relieved to see her awake as Feshikha weakly tries to stand up but Gwangi stops her and tells her to rest. Feshikha is surprised and touched that they came for her, then she asks them why they saved her. Gwangi tells her they were so worried about her and Meechee pointed her out to them the direction she was running. So they followed her and made sure she was safe from harm, which he tells her that she was lucky that they found her in time before she collapsed and fell to her death. Kolka crawls closer to Gwangi and Feshikha and tells her she is happy that she's alive and tells her not to try to go down the mountain by herself again, because it almost got her killed. Fleem tells her it would've been ugly as Gwangi and Kolka scold him, Fleem then says that she's a brave, reckless little squirt he'll give her that. Feshikha couldn't help but break down crying in front of her friends asking why Migo betrayed her and lied to the village; she did no harm to him or anyone. They tell her they don't know but Gwangi suspects that Stonekeeper is covering something up and possibly thinks that Feshikha maybe a threat to him and their village and Stonekeeper is trying to keep yetis from finding smallfoots with some machine and that he knows something about Feshikha's glowing blue eyes and powers and why she is not feeling sick or cold which were still glowing. Feshikha asks her friends if they think she is a monster but Gwangi brings her up to him and firmly tells hers to never call herself that word again for he assures her that she is no monster and makes her promise him never to call herself that again which she does after seeing a serious look on his face as she remembered that he doesn't like being called crazy. Feshikha confesses that she never asked for any of all that has happened to her: being cursed as a baby, being stolen from her family and now fears she will never see her family or Danni again. Kolka asks who Danni is and Feshikha tells them that he is her only friend in her village since she and Danni are outcasts just like the S.E.S. are in their village and Danni is who she plays and hangs out with, talks with and help animals in need with and even helped her discover her blue powers and how to control them as younger kids. Fleem asks Feshikha about her family and she tells them that she has an older brother Taral and a younger sister Chimini. Then she tells them about her stern father Dhonu and her loving mother Bilhana and that she and her mother had a heartwarming conversation before Feshikha's disappearance and confessed she wished she never left home because her curiosity got the best of her and cries even more. Gwangi picks her up and hugs her gently in his arms and chest as Feshikha is crying. Kolka joins in and tells her they will always be there for her. Fleem reluctantly joins since he couldn't help but feel so bad for her. Feshikha then says to the yetis that they should probably go back to the village in case someone comes to find them with her. But Gwangi and Kolka tell her they're not going back, they're staying with her for two reasons. One: the Stonekeeper will question them and face exile; Two: they are her friends and will never abandon her like Migo did. Feshikha is moved as she was convinced that they really are her friends but she starts to get sleepy. So Kolka and Fleem lay down to sleep while Gwangi lets her sleep in the fur of his big arms and chest as he laid against a rock to sleep. Feshikha, still in tears sings herself to sleep as Gwangi petted her gently until she was sound asleep feeling safe and warm in his fur. That morning before the sun was up, Feshikha wakes up under Gwangi's hand on his chest while Gwangi, Kolka and Fleem were still sleeping. Feshikha sits up on Gwangi's chest and looks at the campfire which went out overnight. She thought of Percy who was still in trouble and she knew she had to do something or he will die. So she decided that she was done being scared and done running away from trouble and it was time to be brave with an angry yet determined look on her face; planning a brave yet stupid decision to go back and rescue Percy. So Feshikha quietly sneaks off of Gwangi and runs off back to the yeti village using her powers yet again to get there. She makes it to the entrance and quietly sneaks past the yeti houses and shops until she hears a crunch in the snow. Feshikha gasped then quickly turns around to see Soozie expressing her happiness to see her alive. Feshikha tries to quietly tell Soozie that she's just here to rescue her friend and tells her to go home and not say anything to anyone. But Soozie hugs Feshikha as she figures out that Soozie wants to help her so she reluctantly agrees to let her tag along as long as Soozie can keep quiet. So they both sneak up to the ice palace then Soozie helps Feshikha up the stairs and arrive at the large thick ice door. Feshikha uses her blue flamethrower attack to create a hole to get inside, then she whispers to Soozie to wait outside for her. If anything goes wrong she will bring Percy out to Soozie and have her take him to hide in case she gets caught, which Soozie nods in agreement. She looks around making sure the coast was clear and walks into the palace. As she walked, she looks at all the yeti statues with stone robes just like Stonekeeper feeling a little scared, but shut that fear out remembering that she had to be brave. Then she sees Thorp sitting by a statue asleep, snoring loudly and guarding Percy in the ice box and hides behind a statue. Percy wakes up to see Feshikha but she gestures him to be quiet and he quickly pretends to be asleep knowing what she was going to do. Feshikha quietly sneaks behind the statue and Thorp and was ready to save Percy. She uses her telekinesis to unlock the lid and lift it off the top and gently set it down on the ground. Then she uses telekinesis again to gently lift Percy up and out of the box and bring him down to her to her hiding spot. Feshikha tearfully embraces Percy and warms him up as he quietly gives her his happiness to see her and gratitude for coming back for him. She apologizes for leaving him and regrets making the deal and she never should've trusted Migo. But Percy assures her that it wasn't her fault at all, they were going to imprison her too so she did what she had to do. But he figured that she would return and found out what her powers can really do and is forever grateful to her for coming back at the right time and told her that she really is a \"spunky kid with integrity\". Percy also tells Feshikha that the blue glow she accidentally put in his head the other day did something to protect him from the cold and high altitude through the night and that she techincally was protecting him the whole time they were seperated. She smiles and tells him that she's not leaving without him for they started this adventure together and they're going to finish it together with Percy agreeing with her but starts getting cold. Then she heals Percy again with some warmth and oxygen in his system. Feshikha helps Percy on his feet and holds him on her shoulders and Percy says that she's definitely earned her place on the show or even better, be a superhero. Feshikha lightly giggles at the thought of being a superhero then tells him that she doesn't care about being on TV or fame, because nothing was more important to her than their friendship. But now was not the time to celebrate, for they still had to get out of the palace and out of the village. So Feshikha holding Percy quietly sneaks behind the statues away from Thorp heading for the hole in the door where Soozie was happily waiting for them. Suddenly, Thorp wakes up and sees the box was empty and realizes the smallfoot was gone. He looks to see Feshikha and Percy running towards the door and he gets up and goes after them. Feshikha turned around and gasped, Percy tells her to run and save herself, but Feshikha tells him that she's done being scared and running away because has to protect something which was him. She tell him that she'll see him outside and used telekinesis to push Percy through the hole outside to Soozie and she stood her ground ready to fight as Soozie took Percy hid away from the door on the stairs, peeking at Feshikha. Feshikha warned Thorp that she doesn't want to fight him but she will if she has to. Ignoring her warning, Thorp tries to grab Feshikha but she uses blue electric attack to shock his hand this time. Then she lets him chase her around the statues until she was out of sight. Thorp looks all around for her until he hears her voice saying \"Hey! You looking for me?\" Then he looks up to see her on his head. He gets ready to crush her with his fist until she jumps off sliding down the staff of a statue at the last minute causing him to hit himself on the head and he gets dizzy. Then she freezes his feet to the ground in ice causing him to fall on his butt against the statue by the ice box. Then she freezes his hands on the statue and finishes him off by freezing his mouth so he couldn't call for help. Feshikha climbs on his knee and bravely tells him that she warned him but still she doesn't want to hurt him or anyone but tells him to give a message to Stonekeeper and Migo \"If you ever come near me or my friend again, you are going to answer to me just like Thorp.\" Meechee enters and grabs Feshikha and tells Thorp that he has anger issues because of a \"father complex\" which meant he never got enough hugs as a kid from Dad. Meechee tells her that she saw the battle and she is so proud of her. Feshikha tells Meechee that she'll take Percy down the mountain, but Meechee insists that she will take them home herself, for she's had enough of her Dad and Migo's lies. So they quickly head in Meechee's room and Meechee grabs their backpacks and sleeping bags as Feshikha used telekinesis to draw a yeti carrying two humans down the mountain symbolizing them going home on her wall. So Meechee carries Feshikha on her shoulder downstairs, quietly opens the door and grabs Percy from Soozie on the stairs (who was filming the battle the whole time) and puts him in his sleeping bag to keep him warm and carries him in her arms. Feshikha gives Soozie her gratitude for her help and rewards her with a big beautiful blue frozen flower she grows from her hands and gives it to Soozie then she quietly heads for home. Meechee quietly closes the door while Feshikha sat on her shoulder, feeling proud of herself and happy, knowing she saved her friend and they were going home at last with Meechee's help. Meechee starts her way to Feshikha's village by heading to the ice cliffs and decides to jump down like Migo fell down last time, but Feshikha is terrified at the idea. Meechee assures her that she'll keep her promise to protect her and Percy and they won't die. Feshikha trusts Meechee since there was no other option at this point. Meechee runs and jumps off the cliff and they all fall a long way down to the bottom into the deep snow like a pillow. Feshikha lifts a force field around her and Percy and she climbs out and pulls Percy out too but he was still very weak. Meechee puts Percy in his sleeping bag in her arms and puts Feshikha on her shoulder and they both start their way to the village telling Percy he's almost home. Meechee looks at the forest and mountains in awe, and then she asks Feshikha where she lives. Feshikha tells Meechee to head in a direction and Meechee starts walking to Feshikha's village. Later, Meechee arrives in Feshikha's village to her neighborhood to Feshikha's house, but to their surprise, no one was around. Feshikha tells Meechee that she'll wait in her house for her family to come home assuming the entire village went out looking for her. Feshikha tells Meechee that she'll never forget her and confessed that she and Percy will never go back to the yeti village because of what happened yesterday which Meechee didn't blame her. So Meechee promises Feshikha that she will come to see her every once in a while after sunset, which Feshikha liked the idea. Suddenly, Kopisha arrives and greets Meechee and Feshikha. Feshikha is happy to see Kopisha and introduces her to Meechee. Meechee puts Feshikha down and gives her backpack back to her. Kopisha admits she knew about the yeti's existence and can hear them talk too since she is the shaman woman to both Meechee and Feshikha's shock. Kopisha thanks Meechee for bringing Feshikha and Percy home safely. Meechee says goodbye to Feshikha and tells her that she will see her later and proceeds to the city to drop off Percy next. Feshikha asks Kopisha where everybody is and Kopisha answers by telling her that they were gone out looking for her but they all should be back by nightfall. Kopisha offers Feshikha to stay with her until her family returns, which she accepts. So they both walk back to her house and Feshikha settles in nicely, finally relieved to be away from the yeti village and safe from the wrath of Stonekeeper. Kopisha notices Feshikha is upset about something and tells Feshikha to tell her everything about her experience with the yetis. Feshikha tells Kopisha everything from her kidnapping to Migo's betrayal and escape and saving Percy. Kopisha feels bad for Feshikha when Migo betrayed her and Percy and broke his promise causing her to run away and get lost on the mountain; but it was a relief to her that she had friends looking out for her. Kopisha was even impressed how she bravely went back to save her friend and took on a yeti without killing him as she taught her well to be better than hurting anyone. Feshikha wants answers from Migo that Stonkeeper won't give her but he wouldn't tell her. Kopisha tells her to not think about it anymore, she is home now and everything will be back to normal when her family returns home with a wonderful surprise waiting for them. She gives Feshikha a hot cup of tea, drinks it and dozes off to sleep on her couch as Kopisha puts a blanket on her and sends Jadu to find some gooseberries to make some medicine with. Later that day, Kopisha is keeping the fire in her fireplace going while Feshikha is napping on her couch until she hears someone knocking at the door. Kopisha answers the door, comes outside and sees Jadu (looking like he was hugged too tight) with the gooseberries returns and begs to her not to get mad, but \"they\" made him lead them to Feshikha. To Kopisha's surprise, she looks up to see Migo, Gwangi and Kolka are outside her home. Kopisha tells them that this was not the time and place for yetis and she must ask them to leave. Migo asks Kopisha to hear him out, he asks for Feshikha because he needs to speak to her. Recognizing Migo from the story, Kopisha tells him that she isn't sure because she knows what he did to her. Migo realizes Kopisha knows about his actions and feels guilty. But he tells her he knows what he did and she needs to hear him out. Kopisha tells Migo that Feshikha and Percy are home now, no thanks to him and to leave her alone. Migo tells Kopisha he heard about Feshikha's heroic deed and he is impressed, but the real reason he's here is because he's looking for Meechee and he needs Feshikha to come with him and help find Meechee. After some hestitation, Kopisha tells him to wait for a moment and closes the door. Kopisha wakes Feshikha and tells her she has visitors. Feshikha asked if her family returned but Kopisha tells her they haven't, but she has three visitors. Feshikha asks who is here and Kopisha reluctantly tells her it was her three yeti friends, to Feshikha's shock that they've come down from the mountain. Feshikha asks what they want and Kopisha tells her that Migo wants to talk to her and he needs her help. Feshikha gets up and walks to the door and says in an angry tone \"Go away, Migo\" and then she lays back on the couch, pulls the blanket over herself; still very angry for his betrayal as Kopisha watched in sympathy for her. Kolka and Gwangi gesture Migo to apologize to Feshikha. Migo kneels down, opens a window and gives a heartfelt apology that he let fear stop him from doing what he should've done the other day. He is impressed with how she rescued her friend and defeated Thorp single-handedly. But Meechee has never come back home and Feshikha knows the land better than he does and needs to find Meechee before someone else does but he can't do it without her. Migo admits he was a horrible friend and he really hurt her bad and that she was the best thing to happen to him and the yetis and that she is not what he was convinced she was. He is not asking for her forgiveness, but he really needs her help before something bad happens to Meechee and promises her that he'll explain everything after they find Meechee and admitted she was right, he really was a lying, heartless monster to her. His father encouraged him to go find her and Stonekeeper regretted his actions and that he needs her help to find Meechee promising her he will leave her alone afterwards. Feshikha laying down on the couch thought of his words, debating if she should forgive Migo or not; yet she suspected that Stonekeeper told Migo something about her powers she wants to find out. Kopisha touched by Migo's apology, opens the door and tells them that Feshikha is unsure if she should help or not. Gwangi and Kolka tell her they will talk to Feshikha because they saved her life and she'll listen to them. Kopisha tells Feshikha that the other two yetis want to talk to her. Feshikha reluctantly agrees, so Kopisha tells Gwangi and Kolka to come around to the back and tells Migo to stay where he is, which he agrees to. Gwangi and Kolka walk away from Migo to the back of the house as Feshikha comes outside to her friends. Gwangi picks up Feshikha, spins her around and gives her a hug. He tells her that they're amazed with her heroic rescue they heard from Migo and that Thorp got his butt kicked by a smallfoot; even Kolka was impressed at Feshikha's bravery. Feshikha felt proud of herself, but she asks why they're helping Migo after he said all those mean things about them the other day. Gwangi tells her that they're still mad at Migo, but decided to help anyway for Meechee. Kolka hugs her and then tells her that she doesn't have to forgive him but she could do it for her, Meechee and Gwangi as Meechee was the one who pointed Feshikha out to them during her escape and sent them to help her, then she puts her back down. Feshikha thought about Meechee looking at the necklace she made for her as she is happy that her plan worked that she saved Percy and got home safely but realized if the people in the city see Meechee, they will think she is a monster and try to kill her or have her captured and locked in a cage. Feshikha couldn't bear the thought of that; so she thought it was time to repay Meechee, Gwangi and Kolka for all they've done for her. So she turns to Kopisha as she is standing with her coat, scarf and mittens hinting her what to do. Feshikha says to herself that she must be out of her mind and takes her clothes and puts them on and agrees to go with them saying that her family will have to wait for a little longer and she wants answers from Migo. They walk back the front where Migo is waiting for an answer. Feshikha says she will help him but she explained that she is only doing it for Meechee, Gwangi and Kolka; not for Migo, which Migo agrees with and warmly thanks her. Then Kopisha gives Feshikha a little glowing vial and tells Feshikha it contains the Zoolingualism power and to give to a special someone that she feels will need it to help her, which Feshikha unsure about but agrees with anyway. Kopisha whispers to Feshikha that she hopes she finds the answers she needs to know. Then Feshikha is placed on Gwangi's shoulder once again as Kopisha tells the yetis to take good care of her and bring her home safely, which they promise they will and start their way to the Yak Shack to start looking for Meechee. That night, the three yetis and Feshikha arrive at the Yak Shack, as they searching the area for Meechee. Migo sends Feshikha into the Yak Shack to ask anyone if they saw anything out of the ordinary. So she runs into the Yak Shack and is relieved to be among humans for the first time in a few days. She walks over by the bar and overhears two men talking about something big they think they saw headed into the city, which worries Feshikha. As she walks out of the front door, she hears a familiar voice calling her name as she turns around to see Danni several feet from her. They both run and embrace each other, so happy and reunite. Feshikha asks Danni what he was doing at the Yak Shack and he tells her he was looking for her since yesterday when he heard about her disappearance and was searching the Yak Shack area, then got hungry and grabbed a quick bite to eat and gives his leftovers for Feshikha to eat as she hasn't had human food in two days trying to digest yeti food such as rock fruits and snow pops. Danni tells her that her family is heartbroken, especially her father who regretted his words he said to her the following night. Then tells her of the video of her and Percy with Migo went viral and now Feshikha is an internet celebrity, which surprises Feshikha as he knows about the yeti who kidnapped her and wants to pick out which of their videos they want to post to boost their popularity when they get home. Feshikha tells him not right now as she tells him she's on a secret mission. Danni realizes Feshikha's hiding something and asks her about it; so she makes him promise not to freak out when she introduces him to \"new friends\", which he complies. So Feshikha takes Danni to her friends Kolka and Gwangi behind some pine trees away from the Yak Shack. Danni is shocked to see real yetis as she runs up to them and tells them what she found out, making Danni realize the yetis really meant no harm. Danni slowly approaches the two yetis and are both shocked to see another young smallfoot. Feshikha assures Kolka and Gwangi that Danni is the boy she told them about the other night and she introduces Danni to them to their relief. Then Feshikha remembered the vial of potion Kopisha gave her and asked Danni if he would like to talk to animals including yetis just like her, Danni tells her that he'd like to; so Feshikha gives him the vial and he drinks the potion. Then after a while, the spell took affect and Danni's hearing goes from Gwangi and Kolka's growling noises to clear English words to his shock and tells Feshikha that it's working and both yetis are shocked to hear Danni talk. Kolka takes an instant liking to Danni and picks him up and hugs him as she was told about him to Danni's confusion as Feshikha laughs. Gwangi picks up Feshikha and perches her on his shoulder, then grabs Danni and hugs him against his cheek just like with Feshikha the other day and tells him that any friend of his \"small fry\" is a friend of theirs. Migo approaches the group and is shocked to see another smallfoot as Danni recognizes the yeti from the viral video and realizes he was the yeti who kidnapped his best friend that night. Kolka takes Danni from Gwangi as Migo reminds Feshikha that they have to find Meechee but Feshikha angrily tells him that she knows and they are bringing Danni to help to which Danni agrees and points out fireworks firing in the sky and realize Meechee was nearby in the city. They enter the city and see Meechee surrounded by police officers as they were trying to bring down Meechee with nets and hooks until Feshikha comes up with an idea and sends the yetis to hide in the Yeti Museum while she and Danni run through the city to find Meechee and lure her to the museum. Feshikha explains to Danni everything that has happened along the way including Migo's betrayal, the rescuing of Percy plus battling Thorp and her discovery of her aerial adaption which she shows him by taking off her coat to prove it to his shock as they continue to Meechee to carry out the plan. Meechee hears a whistling sound and turns to see Feshikha and Danni getting her attention with Feshikha's blue flames circling above them. Meechee is happy to see Feshikha so she heads towards them and grabs her and Danni and runs through the city with police cars chasing them. Feshikha tells Meechee to turn at a corner then both kids shout out \"mystical creature,\" until Meechee is grabbed by Migo and is pulled into the back entrance of the Yeti Museum. Meechee is so happy to see Kolka and Gwangi and thanks them. Meechee looks at Danni, then she remembered Feshikha telling her about him the other day so she thanks him for coming to help her to Danni's shock that Meechee knew his name. Feshikha explained to Danni that she told the yetis about him and introduces him to Meechee. Then she gives Danni back to Kolka as Feshikha puts her winter coat back on and her eyes fade back to normal proving her point to Danni to his shock. Meechee thanks Feshikha for coming and saving her from the smallfoots, then Meechee tells Feshikha that the blue glow came out of Percy's head and he was revived after she dropped him off. Feshikha realized she can pass on a protective power to any human up high altitude to protect them including Percy and Danni. Feshikha tells Meechee she is returning the favor by helping her and the others escape the city and back to the mountain. Meechee tells her that she will never let her out of her sight again and give each other a big hug. During that moment, Kolka gives Danni another big hug to Danni's displeasure as Feshikha laughs at Danni again. Meechee holds Feshikha in her hand and asked why the smallfoots turned on her until Migo comes out of the shadows and explained that they're terrible creatures. Feshikha and Danni are offended as Kolka gives Danni to Gwangi as she goes to keep a lookout through a window. Meechee is very angry at Migo and tells him to stay away from Feshikha and Danni. Migo explained he said what he said to protect Meechee as she argued that he did by lying, as he pointed to her that she has been lying to her Dad as the secret leader of the S.E.S. Feshikha demanded Migo to stop playing games and unless she gets answers about her powers and his betrayal, he's on his own. Migo hesitated but he remembered that he indeed promised her that he would explain everything after they found Meechee. So he gives in and told her that he was protecting Meechee from the humans and pointed at the pictures of humans hunting and killing yetis on a wall. Migo reveals that it was what Stonekeeper showed him and it was why he lied, calling them monsters to Feshikha and Danni's horror that their kind hunted and killed yetis a long time ago. Then Migo tells Feshikha the story of her encounter with the old yeti 10 years ago giving her the blue potion that gave her the Blue Powers and Aerial Adaption that came from a dangerous blue source Stonekeeper tried to take away but failed so he banished the old yeti and the yeti died afterwards. Feshikha asked Migo why the old yeti gave her the blue potion but Migo told her that he really doesn't know. Meechee remembered the old yeti as a child and explained he was the reason they started the S.E.S because he opened their eyes about asking questions and knowledge since he wanted to make a difference in the yeti village. Migo, Meechee and Feshikha look at a painting of a yeti attacking humans and Meechee realizes that it was not true; humans think yetis are monsters. Feshikha and Danni are fearfully shocked that they learned the truth of what humans really think of yetis and she held her head in shame, regretting ever being afraid of yetis as Danni sitting in Gwangi's hand also regrets thinking of yetis as monsters. Meechee asks Feshikha if she and Danni knew about it; Feshikha sadly admits she did know that yetis were regarded as monsters, mythical creatures and feared too and so did she and had a fear of them as a toddler. But since she and Percy spent time with yetis, she learned that all the scary stories about yetis were wrong and grew to love yetis and wanted to thank the old yeti that gave her the blue potion to discover the yetis true nature along with her animal communication power she was born with, thus realizing that this was her destiny to have a smallfoot communicate with the yetis. Meechee is touched and assures her that they are still friends no matter what and they learned it was all a big misunderstanding and points out there is no reason for yetis and humans to be afraid of each other just because they're each different and that's why the old yeti chose her, which makes Feshikha feel a little better. Danni feels horrible for the yetis and tells Feshikha and the yetis that he wishes they could undo the past but no one can so they can't change what humans in the past did before, but he and Feshikha can change what they do next. Knowing Danni is right, Feshikha keeps her promise to help the yetis escape back to the mountain no matter what the cost. Flashing lights flickered through the windows as police cars were arriving as Meechee pointed out if they really all bad, until Feshikha points that there are both good and bad humans, even pointing out Migo's toe wound from the bear trap she and Percy healed as an example. The police try to break open the museum doors as Feshikha and Danni are afraid until Migo grabs Feshikha from Meechee and Kolka grabs Danni from Gwangi as Danni tells Gwangi to break down the wall and Migo tells Feshikha to get them out of here; which Feshikha says that she will and get them as far as the outskirts of the city, only then she and Danni will have to leave and go home which Migo consents. So they break out of the museum and the four yetis with Migo carrying Feshikha to guide them through the city and Kolka carrying Danni as they run through the streets while Feshikha uses her blue powers to move objects out of their way and create diversions for the police cars in a Pacman-like reference. Gwangi cuts the power in the city allowing the yetis to climb the buildings and leap from building to building up towards the mountain. Percy and Brenda drive up on the snowmobile to find the yetis as Percy catches a glimpse of the yetis jumping from above them and carrying the children with a flash of Feshikha's blue glowing eyes with them. Brenda learns about Feshikha's powers at first glance. Percy takes the snowmobile, leaving Brenda behind and follows them to the outskirts of the city promising to save the yetis and Feshikha's life because she saved his. They all head for the mountain as a helicopter ambushes them and Meechee, Gwangi, Kolka and Danni hide behind a rock. Migo was trapped in the lights holding Feshikha in his fist. He covers her with his other hand as her eyes were glowing until Stonekeeper arrives and throws all his stones from his robe at the helicopter causing the helicopter to crash and the pilot falls out defeated but unharmed. Meechee is happy to see her father as he admits he finally listened and both reconcile and hug. Feshikha is put down on the ground is happy to see them make amends; but remains distrustful of Stonekeeper and feared he was angry at her for saving her friend and defeating his son. Danni runs up to her asking about him and she tells him that he's the yeti who tried to imprison her and Percy, which convinces Danni that Stonekeeper can't be trusted. So Feshikha tells Migo they can go now as she and Danni decide to head for home thinking they did their part. Danni suspects Feshikha is afraid of something but she tells him that she's fine, hiding the fact that she's afraid of going back to the yeti village and putting Danni in danger. So she is determined to keep Danni from suffering the same fate as Percy almost did by leaving the yetis and going home. As they walk down to the fallen stones by the helicopter crash, Feshikha and Danni come across the stone with smallfoot with glowing eyes as Danni tells her it kinda looked like her. Feshikha explained that Stonekeeper thinks she's a threat to him and the yeti village and tried to keep her from returning home. Out of anger, she destroys stone of the smallfoot with the glowing blue eyes and destroys the other stones with her Earth Manipulation. She tells Danni they were laws of lies written in stones the other yetis lived upon and never knew about to keep yetis away from humans for their safety from humans. But she thinks that living a lie was stupid and cowardly. Danni agrees and says he'd rather live with a scary and complicated truth than live a lie while Migo listens to their conversation. Feshikha admits for example that she knew if she revealed her powers to everyone, they will think of her as a monster but she'd rather live with that truth and be careful how she used them wisely than hiding herself away from everyone she loves. Migo is touched by their conversation then he realized that if her kind found out about her powers, they will regard her as a monster like they do with yetis. The other yetis were listening too as Meechee tells her dad that Feshikha is not what he thinks she is. There is good in her and she uses her powers for good, just as Feshikha demonstrated in the city. Stonekeeper decides to believe Meechee as he realized that Feshikha indeed saved Meechee from the city, she did not hurt Thorp and that he was wrong about her. Suddenly, the children and the yetis see 5 SWAT Team snowmobiles with tranquilizer dart guns heading their way and start firing at the yetis and at Feshikha and Danni as her eyes were still glowing blue, not knowing it was a human girl. Feshikha gets angry and creates blue force fields to block the darts from hitting the yetis and saves Gwangi from getting hit in the leg and Danni from getting hit in the head. Migo tells the yetis to take the children and go, they can't let the SWAT Team follow them home and discover Feshikha's powers. Feshikha decides to create a diversion despite Danni's protests, but Migo stops her and decides to run off to divert the snowmobiles away. Feshikha warns Migo they're going to capture him but Migo persists and tells her not to worry and not to use her powers, it's for her own safety. Feshikha and Danni watch Migo run to the SWAT team and they chase Migo in the forest as Feshikha and Danni make a run for it before they come back. Knowing that Feshikha saved the yetis and Danni from being shot at and now were both in danger, Stonekeeper tells Gwangi and Kolka to grab the children and start running up the mountain. Both yetis run down and stop the children and Feshikha asks them what they're doing, they need to go now before the SWAT Team comes back. But Gwangi tells her that they hope they understand why they have to do this to the children's confusion; but realize too late as Gwangi grabs Feshikha and Kolka grabs Danni and both run up the mountain to Feshikha's dismay of going back with them and is starting to feel fear inside her as flashbacks of yesterday evening filled her head. Several feet up the mountain, Stonekeeper tells Feshikha to close her glowing eyes for they will give away their location to the SWAT Team. Feshikha snaps and angrily refuses to trust him as she accuses him that he wants to imprison her and thinks he will try to imprison Danni too. She also questions why he now wants to protect her, calling his previous actions including banishing the old yeti \"unforgivable\" and did what she had to do to his son because of him as Danni is listening in shock. Gwangi tries to calm Feshikha down as she is struggling to get herself free from his hand until he firmly tells her to relax, which she quickly does seeing another serious look on his face. Then he tells her to take deep breaths and she does while pulling her coat hood over her head as tears run down her face. Gwangi pulls her hood off her head and hugs her once again, asking her what's wrong. She confessed she is scared to face a second time away from her family and is afraid for Danni's life; thinking she put him in danger as Percy was in danger before. Meechee comes up to her and gives her a hug in Gwangi's arms then Danni and Kolka join in. Danni tells her that she did not put him in danger, then Meechee assures her that she knows that Feshikha is scared but they are both in good hands now, and it was just temporary until they're out of danger. Kolka reminds Feshikha that they're there for her and Danni and they're just hiding them to keep her powers from being discovered. Stonekeeper sympathizes her and admits he was wrong about them and apologizes for the way he treated her and Percy as he assures her that he won't imprison her or Danni now that he trusts them. Feshikha is having a hard time accepting his apology and even says that won't be able to see ahead of her until Danni comes up with a solution and reaches into his backpack and gives Feshikha a pair of sunglasses to cover her glowing eyes which works as Meechee wiped her tears off her face and reminds her that they're just hiding her as they continue up the mountain. As they made their way up, they all hear a cry in pain as they realize Migo was captured and look down the mountain to see who they thought was Migo being captured but turned out to be Percy in a yeti disguise and allowed himself to get caught by the SWAT team and the press saying it was a funny joke, making them believe it was all a hoax. The real Migo returns to the group in a drunk-like state revealing Percy shot Migo with his tranquilizer gun as Feshikha realizes and tells the yetis and Danni that Percy shot Migo to keep from running and took his place of being captured thus saving the yetis and Feshikha to Stonekeeper's surprise and the S.E.S's relief. They all watch as Percy is arrested and sees the yetis and the children up the mountain noticing Feshikha's blue glow creating a \"thumbs up\" symbol above her in the distance meaning she and Danni are alive and the yetis are alright as she takes off the sunglasses as her eyes fade back to normal smiling down at him, feeling much better. Percy deletes all the footage of the yetis except for the pictures of him and Feshikha as he treasures their friendship more than fame and he knows the yetis will keep her and Danni safe. Migo drunkenly admits his love for Meechee and she returns her love for him; while Danni assures Stonekeeper that the drug in Migo's system will wear off on it's own. With encouragement from Kolka, Danni finally has the courage to confess his feelings for Feshikha and tells her she is his glow in his life (referencing her glowing eyes and powers) and she returns her feelings by giving him a kiss on the cheek and hug, which the yetis smile at the new young couple. Feshikha and Danni think the yetis don't need them anymore so they start to head down the mountain for home, knowing they were out of danger. As they walked down, Feshikha apologizes to Danni for dragging him into this, but he tells her that she shouldn't, he is actually glad she did involve him with the yetis to her relief. As she is telling Danni of all the fun she had and showing off some new skills she learned, the yetis approach them and Feshikha asks what they're doing, they're safe now and need to go home. Migo steps forward, kneels down to her and admits to Feshikha that he was wrong about all humans and that she is a really good one because she is kind, compassionate, selfless and brave and that he and the yetis love her and the four other yetis nod in agreement. Feshikha with tears of joy in her eyes tells him he's no lying, heartless monster after all. Migo tells her not to apologize and he is so sorry for all he's done to her and put her through. Feshikha warmly smiles and finally forgives Migo as he picks her up and both give each other a hug as she kisses him on the cheek as the yetis and Danni watch with happiness as she says, \"I love you too\" as they rekindle their friendship. Migo brings Danni into the hug as Stonekeeper approaches Migo and Feshikha and asks her if she could help him with something. He tells her that since she convinced Danni that yetis are not monsters, he asks her to tell all humans that they are not monsters. Feshikha points out that is wasn't enough to simply tell Danni that yetis aren't monsters, she had to show him that, which Danni nodded in agreement; then he gets an idea: to make a video about the yetis at yeti village and the whole story. But Feshikha warns Danni that he won't be able to survive up the mountain and he'll get high altitude sickness just like Percy did. Then she remembered her discovery of her high altitude protection spell so she puts a blue glow into Danni's forehead and the spell took effect so Danni can now survive high altitude and extreme cold temperatures, but only until he comes back down the mountain that the spell will wear off. So both children agree to go back to the yeti village with the yetis as both children are each put on Migo's shoulders. Just then, Fleem finally drops down the mountain and asked if he missed anything, to the group's disappointment. Danni asks Feshikha who he is, but Feshikha says that she'll tell him along the way. The next morning Migo gives an inspiring speech about their history about yetis and humans and apologizes for his lie and betrayal to all the yetis in the secret chamber in the ice palace in front of the mural of the history of humans attacking yetis. Danni is recording live on his phone of Feshikha sharing her story of her adventure with the yetis and Percy Patterson and showing the mural of their history and Feshikha pointed out Percy's selfless act the other night was all to protect the yetis from humans hurting them thus clearing his name and restoring his reputation. Feshikha also says that he inspired her to follow her heart to help the yetis and doesn't care if this video was viral or not just as long as she gets the message out in some way hoping to inspire someone as Percy inspired her. Thorp and Feshikha have made amends as he asks Migo if they really didn't fall out of the butt of the great sky yak; which Feshikha and Danni burst into laughter as Migo tells him that they probably didn't and will circle back to that question later while both kids stop laughing and need to continue their video. Migo says that each race think they're monsters and it wasn't going to change by the yetis hiding so they have to communicate and to figure out what they want to do and have Feshikha to help them. So Stonekeeper allows Migo to turn off the steam machine clearing the mountain as Danni is filming the machine being shut off. All the yetis and the children gather outside on the ice cliffs to get a beautiful view of the Himalayas for the first time as Feshikha gives a final message saying that it was time to welcome the yetis back to the world with open arms of friendship and that yetis are friends, not monsters. Feshikha and Danni wrap up the video and run off from the yetis for some privacy. They both check Danni's phone to see their video went viral and Feshikha is now more famous and getting many offers from networks in Danni's email and voice mail account. Danni is delighted and spins Feshikha in the air admitting he could just kiss her until he realizes he said it out loud and regrets it. But Feshikha kisses his cheek again and they both share their first kiss and hug. Then they realize all the yetis were behind them, watching them happily to the kid's embarrassment as Soozie makes a mindblow gesture, Kolka saying that she's proud of Danni and Gwangi nods at them as all the yetis make a heart shape with their hands as Feshikha taught them earlier. They both laugh as Danni and Feshikha are both picked up by Migo and Kolka and the yetis start their way down the mountain. The yetis carrying Feshikha and Danni arrive down at the city as the blue glow in Danni's head wears off as all the humans are gathering while police arrive to barricade them until Feshikha gets worried as Stonekeeper reminds her not to use her powers which she consents. She and Danni are put down on the ground and both stand up to the police, which everyone realizes Feshikha is the girl from the new viral video and realize she was telling the truth about the yetis and her adventure. Percy arrives at her side along with Brenda to stand with the children encouraging everyone to welcome the yetis with open arms just like in the video. So all the villagers approach the yetis and slowly start to accept them into their lives as Feshikha introduces Brenda to Meechee and the crazy pilot to Gwangi. Migo and Percy are reunited as best friends as the people start befriending all the yetis. As happy as they were to see humans and yetis united in harmony, Danni and Feshikha look around for their families but they were nowhere to be found. So they both decide to walk back to their village until Migo stops them and asks Feshikha where she and Danni were going. Feshikha tells him both their families were not among the crowd so they're heading back to their village. Dorgle reminds Migo of the deal so Migo tells her that he'll take her home for he has a promise to keep so he picks up Feshikha in his hand with Percy on his shoulder and Kolka picks up Danni as all the humans and yetis follow Migo to the village Feshikha and Danni live in. At the Usha house, Bilhana and Dhonu are anxiously waiting for a phone call or some sign that someone found their precious little girl until Taral runs in the living room and tells them to come outside. Dhonu's smartphone rings and it was a business call so for the first time, he ignores the call because right now his family was more important, which impresses Bilhana. So both parents along with Taral and Chimini run outside to see the yetis and people from the city in front of their house with Migo holding Feshikha in his hand and Danni in Kolka's hand. Danni's parents Joseph and Kathryn Strider run out to see their son among yetis as all the neighbors and villagers come out to see the commotion including Kopisha. Bilhana bravely approaches Migo as he lowers Feshikha down to her and they both smile and tearfully embrace. Chimini happily runs to her mother and sister and Feshikha holds her as Bilhana hugs both daughters. Taral joins in saying he knew she was alive all along; then Dhonu with tears in his eyes joins them and tells Feshikha he is so sorry for his behavior towards her and both reconcile as Danni unites with his parents. As Migo and Percy watch the Usha family hug with warm smiles, Migo puts Percy down as Bilhana looks up at Percy and reaches out her hand and pulls him into the family hug. Migo wraps his arms around the family and lifts them up in a big hug as Kolka does the same to Danni and his parents as Meechee and Gwangi join Migo in the hug. Kolka brings the Strider family into the Usha hug with the S.E.S. Migo puts the family down except for Bilhana, Chimini, and Feshikha standing on his hands. Bilhana gives a stern look at Migo, knowing he was the one who kidnapped her daughter. Migo bashfully says hello and asks how she's doing, but she looks at him unamused. Dorgle gestures Migo to stop joking around, then Migo apologizes to Bilhana for kidnapping Feshikha; which he earns her forgiveness as she tells Migo to never let it happen again. To the yeti's surprise they heard Bilhana talk as Feshikha realizes her mother also has Zoolingualism. Feshikha asks her why she never told her and Bilhana simply replied, \"You never asked,\" to Feshikha's disappointment. Bilhana tells her daughter and the yetis that their power runs in the family and Feshikha inherited it. Even Stonekeeper is fascinated with the family's power and he holds Bilhana in his hand and befriends her. To everyone's surprise, Chimini in Feshikha's arms says hello to the yetis and they could hear her too thus realizing Chimini also inherited Zoolingualism. Meechee asks Feshikha if she could hold Chimini and Fesihikha tells Meechee to be gentle which she does as Chimini smiles at Meechee and hugs her. Then Gwangi holds Chimini next and hugs and calls her \"smaller small fry\" similar to what he calls her sister. Taral is shown that he also has Zoolingualism but was afraid to admit it until now as he is picked up and introduced to Thorp. Dhonu is grabbed and introduced to Dorgle as they both check out each other's mustaches. Migo picks up Kopisha and he apologizes for not bringing Feshikha and Danni home last night because they were attacked and also needed them to help the yetis be welcomed into all the smallfoot's lives, which Kopisha assures him that she figured something happened. Stonekeeper takes Feshikha and Kopisha, then encourages Feshikha to show her mother her blue powers and her glowing eyes. So she takes off her winter jacket to reveal her glowing blue eyes as Bilhana remembers she found her daughter as a baby with once and demonstrates her blue powers by creating a circle of blue orbs and makes them disappear to Bilhana's shock. Feshikha tells her that 10 years ago when she wandered off in the forest, she met an old yeti and he gave her a blue potion that gave her the Blue Powers and Aerial Adaption power believing it was meant for all of the events that happened to her; fulfilling her destiny to unite humans and yetis in harmony. Kopisha tells Bilhana she is helping her train with her powers and how to use them wisely for good which invovled her rescuing Percy. Stonekeeper confirms Feshikha's story and tells her that he regrets banishing the yeti for his actions and Feshikha couldn't have proven him more wrong about humans and Feshikha, Kopisha and Bilhana forgive him. Percy finally understands Feshikha's blue powers as he watches her put her winter clothes back on and her eyes fade back to normal and he gathers Feshikha's family and announces to the village and to Dhonu and Bilhana that their daughter Feshikha: the \"spunky kid\" who got him back on his feet, is now his partner and costar for his TV show to her parents and everyone's delight as Brenda congratulates Feshikha as she also knows about Feshikha's blue powers and also promises to keep it a secret and her family promises too. Feshikha requests that Percy make Danni her assistant that he goes wherever she goes, which he agrees. From that day forward, Feshikha and Percy made hit episodes for their TV show traveling place to place as well as Migo and the yetis appearing with them too. Bilhana opens a school for yetis to educate them about the human world and teaching them to read and write. Dhonu has become a better husband and father and not being too focused on his job all the time and learning to control his stress thanks to Dorgle. Kopisha and Bilhana arranged to have a new house made just for Percy in their village as well as Feshikha using her powers to touch it up. Feshikha also has been using her powers for more heroic deeds in secret for people and animals who need help while continuing her new job with Percy. Feshikha didn't let fame go to her head as she and Danni are still finishing school while dating and along with her family and friends helping the yetis fit in with society as humans and yetis are now at peace and harmony as written in new stones and all the selfies of humans and yetis together. In the mid-credits scene, Percy and Feshikha are filming for next week's episode together only for Percy to realize he's missing a tooth, which Feshikha suddenly remembered Migo accidentally knocking it out earlier but chooses not to tell Percy as she acts like and says that she doesn't know.

One: I know I said the last one was the last one. But then I got this idea, and... here we are. and two: It's a day late, but you can consider it a new year's eve special. and three: Percy refers to migo by his name, and meechee by a version of her name. I have an explanation for that, but don't want to bore those who aren't interested. if you want to know, you can PM me or let me know in the comments. Okay, here we go! DISCLAIMER: I own none of the characters who appear in this story. ... \"Fireworks,\" Percy said slowly, for the third time. \"They're like big explosions of color in the sky.\" he made his hands explode. \"But it's a good explosion! Very pretty. You'll like it.\" he watched Migo closely. \"Do you understand?\" Migo just stared at him blankly, and Percy sighed. \"All right, we'll have to do this another way.\" a wave of realization hit him, and he slapped his forehead. \"Of course! Hold on a moment, Migo.\" he grabbed his cell phone and scrolled through it for a few moments, then pressed a button. An image of a firework projected out onto the snow, and Percy gestured at it with his free hand. \"This is a firework.\" he pointed the phone up into the sky. \"They're going to be in the sky tonight, to celebrate the new year.\" he made his hands explode again, and Migo smiled and nodded. Percy took it as a sign of understanding and sighed in relief. \"Finally! I didn't think describing fireworks would be so hard. So, you and Meeka will meet Brenda and I here for the fireworks in a bit.\" they'd been over this part already, and Migo understood what Smallfoot wanted him to do. He nodded again, and Percy smiled. \"Excellent! You go get Meeka, and I'll tell Brenda you're coming.\" he made a shooing gesture with his hands, and Migo went on his way to find Meechee. He walked carefully through the town until he made it to the mountain base, just in time to see Meechee crash into the snow. \"Meechee!\" He called, going over to the hole she'd made and reaching a hand out to her. \"I'm glad you're here,\" he said as she took it gratefully. \"The smallfoot are having some sort of celebration, and Smallfoot says they're going to have big colorful things up in the sky. And apparently, they do this.\" he gestured with his hands what he'd seen Smallfoot do. \"That sounds amazing!\" Meechee said excitedly. \"He wants us to join him and girlfoot at his home to watch them. They start soon, I think, so we'd better hurry.\" \"Let's go then!\" Meechee grabbed his hand and tugged him back to the town. The pair carefully wound their way around the buildings and cars until they made it to Smallfoot's home. Percy turned as they approached him and smiled. \"Hey! I wasn't sure you'd make it in time. The fireworks start in a few minutes. Brenda's going to be a little late- she has to make sure her dog is safe and secure before they start. He doesn't like fireworks,\" he explained. Though they were unsure of what he was saying, both yetis nodded in understanding. Percy patted the ground. \"Have a seat,\" he said. \"Make yourselves comfortable. This is going to be quite the show.\" Migo sat down with a thump, and Meechee soon joined him. Percy pointed at a spot over some houses. \"They're going to be right there. Any minute now…\" he and the yetis watched the sky expectantly, but nothing happened. \"Huh,\" Percy said. \"I guess it might be a little long-\" a loud boom cut him off, and both Migo and Meechee flinched, staring at the sky with worry. \"Ah, there they are!\" Percy said, turning to smile at them. He frowned, noticing they were shaking. He reached out to touch Migo's arm. \"Hey big guy, are you alri-\" another firework went off, and Migo flinched harder. He jumped to his feet, barely noticing when Meechee did the same. He only had one thought in his head- to get as far away from the loud booming as he could. He took off through the town at the same as Meechee, but they both went in opposite directions. Percy was left alone, looking after them in confusion and concern. The motor of a snowmobile sounded as a familiar person slid up next to him. \"Hey Percy,\" Brenda said, removing her helmet. She looked around. \"Where are Migo and Meeka?\" \"They ran off,\" Percy said. \"The first firework went off, and when the second one came, they both ran.\" \"Oh no,\" Brenda said worriedly. \"They must have scared them, like they scare my dog. They probably don't have anything like that up in the mountains. We have to find them, fast!\" \"Migo went this way,\" Percy said, pointing to the left. \"Meeka went that way.\" he pointed diagonal across the town. \"Okay,\" Brenda said, thinking quickly. \"You go after Migo, I'll get Meeka. We have to hurry, they must be terrified!\" she took off in the direction percy had pointed, calling \"Good luck!\" over her shoulder. \"You too!\" Percy called before running in Migo's direction. He called for him as loud as he could, hoping he'd be able to hear him over the fireworks. \"Migo! Migo, where are you?\" he looked around frantically, with only street lamps and the fireworks to light up the dark town. Most everyone had turned their lights off and were outside to watch the fireworks. He ran and called until he got to the edge of town, where the Coffee House was at. He squinted at it. Was it his imagination, or were there two blue horns sticking up over the side? \"Migo!\" he yelled, sprinting across the snow. He found the yeti on the ground, his hands on the sides of his head and his eyes screwed shut. Percy approached him gently, patting the yeti's knee to alert him to his presence. Migo opened his eyes and looked down at him, his eyes wide and full of fear. \"It's all right,\" Percy said, trying to keep his tone quiet and gentle. \"It will all be over soon, I promise.\" Migo picked him up suddenly, causing Percy to yelp in shock. He calmed down when Migo held him close up next to his cheek. He put his arms around him and gave him a hug. After a few minutes, he tapped Migo's fur and, when the yeti looked at him, pointed up at the sky. Migo looked up just as another firework went off in a burst of color. His eyes widened, and he started to smile. \"Wow,\" he whispered. \"That's actually really beautiful. Once you get passed the noise.\" noticing the change, Percy smiled at Migo as he got his phone out and texted Brenda. I found Migo , he typed. We're at the Coffee House. He's calmed down now. How's it going with Meeka? … fifteen minutes ago… \"Meeka!\" Brenda cried, her voice desperate as she wound her way around trash cans and fire escapes and ducked through alleyways. Passing through another one, she saw a giant purple foot just a few yards from her, in the middle of the square. \"Meeka!\" she yelled, staring up at the yeti. She waved her arms. \"Meeka, down here!\" a firework went off, and Meechee flinched, breathing harder and faster. Brenda eyed her leg and sighed. \"I can't believe I'm gonna do this.\" without hesitation, she ran to Meeka's leg and began to climb, digging her fingers into the soft fur. She made it over her hips and up to her chest, then climbed onto her shoulder. Steadying herself by holding onto the shoulder fur, Brenda leaned close to Meeka's head and began to hum softly. She didn't hum anything specific; a theme song, some nursery rhymes, songs that were mostly soft or quiet. After a few minutes, Meechee started to calm down, taking more deep and rhythmic breaths. \"That's right,\" Brenda said softly. \"Nice and easy.\" Meechee looked down at her, a smile on her face and her eyes filled with gratitude. Brenda smiled back, then felt her phone buzz in her pocket. She pulled it out and read a text from Percy. Turning to look at Meechee, she shaped her arms in the form of a house. \"Can you take us to the Coffee House, Meeka? That's where Percy and Migo are.\" Meechee nodded in understanding and stepped carefully through the town. They made it to the Coffee House, and with the fireworks on the other side of the town, it was a little more quiet. Percy and Migo were both seated on the ground, but Migo stood when he saw them. Meechee gently set Brenda down next to Percy, then moved past them to throw herself into his arms and spinning him around in the process. He hugged her back, and they sat down together with their arms intertwined. Percy chuckled to himself. \"They really seem to like each other,\" he said, nodding at the yetis. \"Maybe they're in a relationship.\" \"Maybe,\" Brenda agreed, glancing at him sideways. \"They're pretty cute.\" Percy stared into her eyes, captivated. \"Yeah, you-\" he turned bright red. \"I- I mean, yeah, they are,\" he stammered out. He looked away from her, staring at the fireworks as they boomed. He felt Brenda shiver beside him, and turned to look at her suddenly. \"Are you cold?\" he asked her, sounding worried. \"Yeah, a little,\" Brenda admitted, rubbing her arms. \"In my rush to meet you, Migo, and Meeka, I grabbed my light coat instead of my heavy one by accident.\" Without hesitation, Percy removed his coat and handed it over to her. \"Here, take mine.\" Brenda smiled at him in thanks as she put it over her shoulders. Her eyes traveled up his frame, noting how now he only had a thin jacket over a t-shirt, most likely. He shivered, and she frowned. \"Now you're cold.\" she grabbed the jacket in her right hand then put her arms around him, therefor covering them both with his coat. Percy froze at her touch, his heart thumping wildly at how close they were. He stared up at the fireworks, trying to fight down his emotions. After a few moments, he slowly started to relax without knowing why. A few seconds later, it hit him. Brenda was gently rubbing his shoulder and forearm, and her hand was placed on his knee. And even worse- he was holding it with his own! He tensed up, all his muscles going rigid. Brenda squeezed his hand. \"Are you all right?\" she asked him, her tone gentle. \"I'm fine,\" he said, refusing to look at her. Instead, he looked up at the sky. The fireworks had paused- they must be setting up more , he thought. Brenda removed her hand from his, touching his cheek and turning his head to face her. \"I know that's not true,\" she told him. \"Tell me what's wrong.\" \"We… I mean, I… it's just… we're really close,\" he stammered out, his cheeks turning pink. Brenda raised her eyebrows. \"Does that bug you? You can have your coat back if-\" \"No!\" he shouted. \"I-it's a good kind of close. I just… uh…\" \"Yes?\" for a second, Percy thought he saw her glance down at her watch. But it was quick and barely noticeable. He must have imagined it. \"I- I think I love you,\" he blurted out. No going back now , he thought, holding his breath. Brenda smiled, closing her eyes and leaning in. her lips pressed against his, and after a moment of startled shock, Percy closed his eyes and kissed her back. Explosions burst in his heart, and he became semi-aware of the fireworks exploding, as well as what sounded like loud clapping. Brenda pulled away, whispering softly against his lips, \"Happy New Year, Percy,\" before kissing him again. Still smiling, Migo turned to look at Meechee. \"It's about time they mated,\" he said. \"Anyone with eyes can see they liked each other.\" \"Yeah,\" Meechee agreed. \" They just had to realize it.\" the two small foot had come apart now, and were looking at each other with love filled expressions. Percy looked up at the sky. \"It uh… looks like the fireworks are over,\" he said. Brenda glanced up, then looked back at him. \"Yeah. I guess we should probably go home.\" she got to her feet and offered her hand to him. He took it and got to his feet, squeezing her hand before letting go. \"Goodnight,\" he told her, shoving his hands into his pockets. She stood on the balls of her feet, quickly pecking his cheek. \"Goodnight,\" she said, smiling over her shoulder as she started for her house. Percy watched her go with a smile on his face. He was startled out of his daze when a finger poked his shoulder. When he turned, he saw Migo smirking down at him. He huffed, crossing his arms. \"What are you looking at?\" he asked the yeti. \"I don't tease you about your girlfriend, do I?\" he asked, looking pointedly at Meechee. Migo tilted his head, then shrugged and nodded. He held out his hand, offering to let Percy climb on. When he was safely seated, Migo lifted him to his shoulder to let him sit there for the walk back to his house. Percy looked up at the stars, swinging his feet slightly, then looked down at the yeti and smiled. \"Happy New Year, Migo,\" he said softly. \"I'm so glad I got to meet you.\" though they couldn't communicate directly, Migo got what he was trying to say. \"Happy New Year, Smallfoot.\" ...

I adore pretty much everything about it and have grown fond of the ships. I found myself growing on the idea of Percy and Brenda being a couple. It doesn't seem to be a very popular ship among the fandom but I am deciding to write about it anyway. The ending of the movie had me wondering how Percy suddenly was out of jail the next day because I thought the sentence would be longer. So, here is a missing moment I came up with. Enjoy! They gave him one phone call and one phone call only. Even before the question was asked he knew exactly who he was going to call. Slipping off his gloves, Percy scrolled through the contacts of his cell phone as the security officer waited impatiently. His arms were crossed and his nostril flaring so that his mustache almost looked close to falling off. This would have made Percy chuckle but at this rather serious time he pretended not to notice. Upon pressing the familiar contact photo, Percy felt himself become hesitant. He glanced at those in the police station. Another officer had just entered with a muscular looking man wearing a dirty tank top and handcuffs placed behind his back. \"Come on, kid, we don't have all night.\" Percy was interrupted when the security officer had painfully nudged him in his side with his large elbow. \"S-Sorry,\" he stammered, finally clicking on the contact. He held the phone up to his ear. It seemed to ring forever even though it only rang three times. \"Hello?\" Percy felt his cheeks redden at the sound of her voice, though he didn't particularly know why. \"Brenda,\" he smiled a bit in relief. \"I was expecting your call,\" said his assistant before he could say anything more. She let out a sigh. \"How much to bail your butt out?\" She sounded tired, and he wondered if she had just gotten ready for bed. Even though it was only past nine the events of the day left everyone exhausted. \"$200…\" he murmured, shuffling his feet. There was a silence on the other line that left Percy thinking she might hang up. She had done it many times in the past where he had asked for something unreasonable. During this silence Dirty Tank Top Man asked what he was in for. Percy ignored him. \"You are lucky you have your integrity back, Patterson,\" she said at last. \"I'll be there soon.\" Before Percy could tell her how thankful he was, the phone hung up. \"I don't believe I could thank you enough, Brenda,\" said Percy on the way out. He held the the yeti suit in both of his hands. \"You really saved me back there. Though you have to admit it was pretty cool of them to let me keep the suit. I thought I might have to put up a fight!\" He chuckled. Brenda walked ahead of him, not saying a single word which made Percy nervous in all honesty. Though she had always been the quieter one out of the two since they met. Her arms were crossed and she rubbed them up and down with her hands as she looked back at him. \"Are you cold?\" asked Percy. She lowered her head, reddening a bit. \"N-No! You just talk to much…\" Percy was about to ask what the cold had to do with his nervous chatter- it was a chilly night, after all- but Brenda was busy shifting in her snowmobile. She grabbed a helmet and goggles. \"Heads up!\" Brenda tossed the helmet so hard it made a thud when it hit his chest followed by the goggles. \"I'll take you home.\" Percy put on the goggles and helmet recluently, giving her a hopeful smile. \"Can I drive?\" \"No. Get in,\" she ordered in a quick matter. Percy supposed that she worried that he would crash it like he had once before. Despite it being purely an accident which he had indeed payed for, Brenda still didn't trust him with it. \"Well I didn't crash it while going after the yeti's,\" he muttered, sluggishly getting into the back of the snowmobile. There was little room considering the one she had was designed for one person. He sat down the yeti suit first so he at least had some kind of cushioning for himself even though the ride to his house wasn't far. He could easily walk it but in Brenda's mind she had already picked up his slack and might as well carry it home. He hadn't known if she had heard or not, and it'd make no difference if she did. Percy decided not to talk on the ride home. At least for the sake of Brenda, who had quite a night herself. Soon after they had accelerated, Brenda came to a stop. Sitting up from where he had been practically squished, he tried to study her face. \"Brenda?\" \"I thought I lost you.\" Her voice was quiet, sounding as if she was about to cry but she held it back. Frowning, Percy slipped out of the snowmobile so he could face her. It always had amused him to see her in her helmet and goggles, and in his opinion she looked like a girls scout but the cute kind. \"Alright, I can't take you seriously with those goggles,\" chuckled the redhead. Before she could say anything to protest Percy did the job for her. \"There's Brenda!\" Brenda couldn't help but laugh at him. No matter how irritated she was he could always find a way to make her smile, even if it hadn't been happening lately. \"I'm trying to be sentimental, I hate you!\" she scolded, punching him on the shoulder. He was quick to wrap her into a tight hug. \"You don't hate me. If you did you would have given up on me a long time ago.\" Brenda felt a tear fall onto his coat. \"Sorry,\" she sniffed, quickly wiping it before hugging him back. \"Its okay, its okay,\" Percy whispered, keeping his grip on her firm and tight. He felt her natural warmth spread through his body and suddenly the night didn't feel so cold. \"I thought you died up in those mountains...damn you…\" She buried her head deeper into his shoulder while his hand instinctively rubbed her back. Quite frankly Percy was surprised he did survive up there in the thin air without much oxygen. He had seemed to lose all track of time while being with the yeti's, a species he did not believe existed until now. Unsure what to say or do, Percy simply closed his eyes, not realizing until now how exhausted he really was. He pressed his cheek against her head gently. She had stopped crying now and her breaths returned to normal. Percy opened his eyes back again to find hers closed. She rested on the crock of his neck, and something about the way she looked so at peace made his ears hot. He thought of their relationship before everything had happened, before his career had gotten started. They were freshman in college, the world just at their feet. Best friends. They thought they were so grown up. Even now, Percy realized, there was still so much to learn. He thought of this good, well-rounded person in his arms, and he wondered how she had managed to get him so far, how she dealt with his crazy get-rich-quick scams and ridiculous plans to not educate but instead deceive his fans. This began to occur to him up in the mountains while explaining to the young female yeti what he did and why he did it. How he was so fascinated with other species that it was all he wanted to do with his life was to be with them. Now, looking down at her, he knew it was all thanks to Brenda. Why didn't she let him spend his sentence in jail? It wasn't a long sentence. Why did she pay the fine? Would he do that for her? He would have, he decided. I would have. The slight chill came back when Brenda had awkwardly pulled away, sitting back in the snowmobile. \"Let's-Let's get going…\" Percy had so much to say, yet he felt the loss of words. Climbing back into the snowmobile, they were quiet the rest of the way. \"Alright, ride's over,\" said Brenda, taking off her helmet and goggles while Percy did the same but he remained where he was. \"What?\" \"Brenda, I want you to know that I'm not going anywhere.\" \"I know, but-\" \"You're stuck with me no matter what.\" A smile appeared across her face. \"Only because I need a job. Don't think too highly of yourself, now. Remember, integrity.\" \"That's right, your favorite word!\" he teased while she stuck her tongue out defensively. \"I think it's a wonderful word.\" \"I'll work on it,\" Percy promised. \"Welp, you're off to a great start, getting yourself arrested,\" she giggled with a teasing lift of her eyebrows. The partners laughed for a moment, just like the good old days, before Brenda let herself become serious again. \"I'm proud of you, Percy. Without you who knows what would have happened to the yeti's.\" \"I do hope they'll be alright,\" Percy said quietly. \"They're extraordinary, you know.\" \"Did you take any pictures?\" \"I did but I deleted them. Some things aren't meant to be exposed, ya know? But I've still got this one as my wallpaper.\" Percy reached for his phone and opened it to show Brenda the picture he had took with Migo. Brenda smiled. \"I recognize that big guy.\" \"Yeah, he was the first one I encountered. I was sure he was going to eat me for dinner, but he showed me his world, and it's amazing!\" Percy budded his knees and frowned again. \"I had to shot him with that tranquilizer to save him. They would have killed him if I hadn't got there on time.\" \"People are selfish. You did the right thing.\" There was admiration and tenderness in her honey colored eyes that he had not seen for a while. He gave her a quick nod. \"I wonder if I'll ever see any of them again.\" \"You can always visit them,\" she said hopefully as an attempt to cheer him up. \"But no almost dying and scaring your friend.\" \"No promises,\" Percy chuckled, heaving himself out of the snowmobile. Brenda helped him with the yeti suit that had to be held with both hands. He held the key to his house with one finger. \"Do you wanna come in awhile? I can make us some coco,\" he offered. \"No thanks, I should be getting home,\" Brenda said rather shyly, rubbing her arm up and down. He was a bit disappointed, but Percy smiled anyway. \"Alright, thanks for the ride, and for bailing me out.\" She shrugged. \"It was nothing, I-\" \"Brenda, it was more than that,\" he said, taking a couple steps closer. \"Thank you for being you.\" He had suddenly felt himself bending down, giving her rather chubby cheek a soft kiss, leaving her in a bit of a shocked daze. \"Goodnight,\" he smiled, unlocking his door. \"Goodnight…\" Her voice was almost a whisper as she softly touched the side of the cheek that he had kissed. Meanwhile Percy dressed into his warmest pajamas and crawled into bed. Though he didn't sleep right away. He thought of all that happened today, and the new things he had seen. He found himself thinking of Brenda once again. She was afraid she had lost him. There wasn't many who cared about him in this town, but she was one of them. Rolling to the other side, Percy smiled. Perhaps Brenda was right. Integrity is a wonderful word. That is the wrap! I haven't been on FF for a while so I kind of forgot how to write A.N's XD Please let me know what you think! Feedback is extremely helpful to me. I would love to continue to write more for this movie, so if you liked this one-shot I will do more.

Percy found himself in the woods at the foot of the mountain, on his own, at night. He wasn't quite sure what he was doing there. Suddenly, he sees Migo in the distance, calling out Percy's name, but he sounded really scared, as if something wasn't right. \"Migo, what is it? Is everything okay?\" Percy asked before running towards him. \"Percy! Where are you?!\" Migo kept yelling, without seeing Percy. \"Migo, I'm right here!\" Percy yelled trying to sound as calming as possible. Then Migo turned and saw Percy, forming a smile on the yeti's face. But suddenly he heard a loud thud from behind Migo, and the yeti fell to the ground, unconscious. Percy's eyes widened and made a river of tears as he saw Migo laying there in front of him. As the yeti had fallen to the ground, Percy saw a tranquilizer dart in Migo's shoulder, Percy gasped with his hands covering his mouth. \"No!\" Percy screamed, \"Take him away, boys.\" Percy heard from the direction Migo had come from, it was the police with tranquilizer guns. \"No, you can't! He didn't do anything!\" Percy yelled out to them as they ran over to Migo and started carrying him away. \"No! Migo!\" Percy screamed as he was getting pulled away from them as he was running. Percy was twitching and rolling around on Migo's chest while sleeping, Migo had been awake for a while now because of that, looking very worryingly at the smallfoot. Until suddenly Percy woke up with a terrified look in his eyes, breathing heavily. \"Hey, it's okay.\" Migo said holding Percy tight, trying to calm him down. \"I'm here, I've got you.\" Percy looked at Migo's face and started bursting out in tears both in relief and fear, burying his face in his fur, holding on to it tightly. Migo held Percy, and pressed him gently against his chest. It tore Migo apart seeing his smallfoot in so much pain, he wanted to help him so he held the little guy as comfortingly as he could. \"Percy, what's wrong?\" Migo said with concern in his voice. \"Y... you needed help and I- I couldn't help you... and they t-took you away and...\" Percy tried to explain but was sobbing so much that he could barely speak. \"Shh,\" Migo interrupted, \"It's okay, I'm fine. It was just a nightmare.\" Migo said, gently wiping away Percy's tears with his finger. \"I'm right here.\" Migo whispered as he was holding Percy close to his heart, \"I'll always be with you, no matter what happens, I'll always be right here.\" Percy was touched by Migo's words, so he held onto his fur even tighter and he wasn't planning on letting go. \"Thank you Migo,\" Percy began, \"For always being there for me.\" Migo then looked at him, not certain of what he meant. (Surprisingly) \"When I was cold, you'd warm me up. When I was scared, you'd make me feel safe. And when I was sad, you'd do anything to cheer me up.\" Percy then looked up at Migo with a smile on his face, even though he still had tears in his eyes. \"And I really appreciate that.\" Percy said, which left Migo with wide eyes as the realization hit him. He had been doing all of those things, because he cared so much about Percy he'd done everything he could to make him feel better, no matter why he was unhappy. Migo looked back down at the smallfoot, with a genuine smile on his face. Percy let out a yawn under his breath, it was still, like, 1 am and Percy had barely gotten any rest so far because of the nightmare. Closing his eyes, Percy was trying to fall asleep, but he was shivering so much it was nearly impossible. Migo understood the little guy's need for a good night sleep, and reached out for the blanket that had dropped to the ground. \"Here, let me get that for you.\" Migo said before dropping it over the cold smallfoot, then picking him up and placing him on his chest after lying back down on the rock he was sleeping on. \"Are you feeling better?\" Migo asked attentively. \"Yeah, I am.\" Percy said sending a 'thanks to you' expression to Migo. \"Now try to get some rest, little guy.\" Migo said with a big warm smile, \"You deserve a long peaceful night's sleep.\" As Migo said that, the little guy slowly began to slip into sleep, still wearing a genuine, happy smile. Migo was happy to see that his smallfoot was all happy again, and would soon get a nice long nap. \"Just relax,\" Migo whispered, \"I would never leave you.\" The End ","Summary":" Sorry, right now I'm not sure how to add more chapters so it's gonna be story-to-story chapters.

Thanks to Sasha winning a Christmas vacation to Nepal, she met the friendly Yeti and all his friends. Sasha introduced Migo and his fellow Yetis to the human holiday Christmas. Ever since that glorious celebration, the Yetis were very eager to learn more human traditions. It was New Year's Eve, the last day for the Jocklin's vacation before returning back to Staybrook, California. So Migo and his father Dorgle decided to show Rachel and Sasha their home while their children played with the young Yetis in the snow. Dorgle clapped twice and fuzzy yellow snails puffed up and glowed around the cave to provide light. \"And this is our bedroom!\" \"Wow! Those snails sure are amazing!\" Rachel took a picture of them on her phone. \"What's that thing?\" Sasha pointed to a strange device located at the end of Dorgle's bed. It looked like a wooden lever device with a feather at the end of it. \"That's my alarm. Wakes me up every morning!\" Dorgle said proudly. Sasha looked at the odd, yet elaborate contraption. \"How does it work?\" Getting a playful idea, Migo whispered it to his father. Chuckling, Dorgle went to the alarm as Migo picked up Sasha and removed her boots and socks. \"Hey! What are you doing?!\" Sasha said, worried. \"Relax, Sasha. We're showing you how the alarm works.\" Migo said reassuringly. He held the human's bare feet in front of the machine. With that, Dorgle poured sand grains from a bottle that fell into the small wooden lever that dropped on one end, raising the feather that tickled Sasha's feet. \"AH! Hey! Hahahahaha! That tickles! Ahahahahahahahahaha!\" Sasha laughed, squirming in Migo's hand. She tried to move her feet away, but Migo wouldn't let her. Migo giggled. \"I love how they laugh, don't you?\" he asked Dorgle, who smiled and nodded. \"Hahahahahahahaha! Turn it off! Hahahahahahahaha! Turn it off!\" Sasha begged in ticklish laughter. \"Come on! Don't tickle me! I can't take it!\" Dorgle stopped the machine. \"Huh. Migo wasn't kidding. You Smallfeet really are ticklish!\" He grabbed Sasha and took hold of her foot. \"To think you can actually feel anything with these tiny little feet.\" He wiggled his fingertip up and down Sasha's foot, making her giggle. \"Please! No more tickling!\" Sasha pleaded through her giggles. Dorgle stopped and Sasha laid limp in his hand. Migo pulled out a strange cloth from Sasha's boot. \"What's this?\" \"Oh, that's a sock, Migo.\" said Rachel, who paused taking pictures. \"Since we humans don't have fur on our feet, we use those to keep our feet warm.\" Migo looked closer at the sock. He sniffed it and dry heaved. \"WHOA! That stinks!\" \"What?!\" Sasha's face went bright red. \"My socks don't stink!\" \"Actually, they kinda do.\" Rachel admitted. Dorgle sniffed the sock. \"HOOFA!\" He felt his mustache curl. \"Holy wowness! That reeks!\" \"Stop it!\" Sasha was dying of embarrassment. \"And give me my stuff back! My feet are freezing!\" Migo gave Sasha her boots and socks back. \"Well, we better get you Smallfeet down the mountain before it's too late.\" \"Huh? Too late for what?\" asked Sasha. Migo appeared hesistant. \"Well, it's just...Smallfoot can't survive up here for long. The last time a Smallfoot was here for too long, he got sick! But Meechee returned him home and he was fine after that!\" Rachel gasped. \"Oh my gosh! You're right! That Smallfoot-I mean, human must have suffered high altitude sickness!\" Sasha started to panic. \"We gotta get the kids and get out of here before it's too late!\" \"Now, now. Have no fear, ladies.\" Dorgle reassured his guests. \"I happen to know a shortcut to the human village.\" Rachel and Sasha quickly rounded up their children and stood on the platform outside Migo's home. It used to be a catapult machine that would launch Dorgle into the gong to awaken \"the great sky snail\" every morning. But after finding out a gong wasn't necessary, Migo and Dorgle put it to better use. \"Thanks to this, we can launch ourselves off the mountain and right to the human village!\" Migo took sat in the wooden chair with the Jocklin family riding on his back and shoulders. \"Ready, Dad?\" \"You betcha!\" Dorgle turned the large paddle wheel that was attached to the seat by a rope. Migo's chair slowly moved backwards as his father cranked. \"Uh, this is safe right?\" Sasha asked nervously, clutching onto Migo's fur tightly. \"Of course! This baby launched me into that gong so many times, I pretty much went numb!\" Dorgle said with much pride. His response did not make Sasha feel any better. \"Get ready, everyone! Hold on tight!\" Migo said. He felt the humans hold onto him VERY tightly. \"Launch!\" Dorgle released a lever and the seat lurched forward, sending Migo and the Smallfeet flying into the sky. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Everyone screamed except Migo. They sailed off the mountain and were going to land to the cold, unforgiving terra firma. But Migo was ready. He managed to land his feet on the ground and glide down the snowy slope. The humans were amazed! It was like Migo was snowboarding without the board! Migo shredded down and down gracefully until they arrived at the town. \"Here we are! Courtesy of the Migo express!\" \"Migo! That was incredible!\" Sasha said, hugging the Yeti's cheek, making Migo giggle. \"Even though I thought I was gonna die!\" Sasha laughed. \"Hey, Migo!\" It was Meechee. She and her brother Thorp walked over to greet Migo and the humans. She held Migo up and the two Yetis shared a kiss. \"Awwwwww!\" The humans cooed. But Sasha noticed Thorp looking cheesed off watching his sister kiss Migo. \"Say, you guys ready to celebrate the new year?!\" Rachel asked her kids excitingly. \"YEEAAAAAAH!\" the children cheered. \"So, tell us more about this 'New Year's Eve' thing.\" said Migo as he and his friends headed to the human village. \"It's simple.\" said Sasha. \"Every year, on this very night, we gather with friends and family to celebrate the previous year and welcome the new one with a big party.\" \"And don't forget the resolutions.\" Rachel added. Thorp blinked. \"What's a restitution?\" Sasha giggled. \"A resolution is a promise you make to yourself that you want to accomplish during the new year. It can be anything.\" \"Anything?\" said Migo, Meechee, and Thorp. \"Yeah, like losing weight, saving up money to buy a car, doing something to become a better person, or doing something for someone you love, anything.\" said Sage. \"Cool!\" Migo's eyes lit up. \"Well, for my resolution, I'm gonna be a better friend to all the Smallfeet out there!\" \"And I'm going to learn everything about the outside world!\" Meechee declared. \"And I'm uh...\" Thorp tried to think of something. \"Don't force it, Thorp. It'll come to you.\" Rachel said. \"Let's get our supplies ready for the party tonight.\" \"I can't wait!\" Meechee hugged Migo and kissed his cheek. Thorp shot a glare and tightened his fists as he watched them hold hands and walk to the human village together. As the friends went into town, Sasha heard a heavy sigh and saw Thorp sitting on a rock looking very upset. \"Um, you guys go ahead. I'll catch up.\" Sasha said. \"Okay! Don't take too long!\" Rachel called back. Sasha turned to Thorp and approached the sour Yeti. \"Thorp, what's going on?\" \"Nothing!\" Thorp huffed, turning away. \"You're upset about something.\" \"No, I'm not!\" \"You're upset that Migo is dating Meechee, aren't you?\" \"YES!\" Thorp blinked. \"I mean, NO!\" Sasha patted Thorp's ankle. \"How come you're upset about that?\" Aren't you glad Meechee has that special someone in her life?\" \"Well, yeah but...I didn't want it to be Migo.\" Thorp admitted. \"Why?\" Thorp heaved a heavy sigh after a brief pause. \"It's just...Migo has always been a great guy, a real great guy. Everybody loves him. And he's discovered the Smallfoot! So he's even more awesome! And Meechee, my own incredibly awesome sister, the person I've always loved since the very beginning is with Migo! They're gonna go off and be an item and leave me all alone! It feel like Meechee is turning her back on me! Her own brother! This sucks!\" \"Thorp, I understand how you feel.\" Sasha said from the heart. \"But you really love your sister, so you want her to he happy, right?\" \"Yeah...\" \"And you said yourself that Migo is a great person right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Then you know very well that Migo is the only Yeti out there who's good enough for your sister. So she's in good hands.\" Sasha concluded. \"And you won't be alone because you're still family to Meechee as well as Migo, you're all family. The best you can do is support them and always love them. Trust me, they won't turn their backs on you.\" \"We definitely won't.\" said a voice. Thorp and Sasha saw Migo, Meechee, Rachel, and the kids. They all had understanding looks on their faces. Meechee put a hand on her brother's shoulder. \"Thorp, I would never turn my back on you. We're family.\" \"And you're part of my family too, Thorp.\" Migo smiled. \"To tell you the truth, I've always wanted a brother, someone who can be a loyal friend and help out when we need it. My mom always said pitching in and helping out is really what love is all about.\" Hearing their wise and thoughtful words, Thorp began to smile and stood up with Migo and Meechee. \"Thanks, guys. And for my my new year's restitution...I'll always be a good brother to you, Migo!\" He happily gave Migo a hug. Migo chuckled and returned the hug. \"Thanks, Thorp.\" That night, all the Yetis and humans gathered in the town square in front of a giant TV screen to see the famous ball drop. Migo sat with Meechee and Thorp. Mechee noticed Thorp was deep in thought, which was very rare. \"What's up, Thorp?\" \"Well, I've been thinking...\" Thorp began. \"It still bugs me knowing that we didn't really fall out of the butt of the great sky yak. I mean, did we even fall out of anyone's butt at all? We still haven't figured that out yet.\" Meechee patted Thorp on the back. \"It's okay, Thorp. These things take time to figure out. In the meantime, let's enjoy what's going on now. Like this awesome party!\" \"Ahahahahahahaha!\" Migo laughed as Rachel and Sasha were climbing up his back, tickling the Yeti. \"Best seats in the house!\" Rachel said. She and Sasha hopped onto Migo's shoulders. \"So, what are your resolutions?\" Migo asked the girls. \"Well, we talked it over.\" said Rachel. \"And we both decided to have the same resolution.\" \"To always be there for our family and do whatever we can to help each other.\" Sasha said. \"What your mother said was right, Migo. Pitching in and helping out is what love is all about.\" \"Okay, you guys! The countdown has begun!\" Sage announced. Everyone, every human, every Yeti began to count down the numbers on the giant screen. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2,1 \"HAPPY NEW YEAR!\" Cheers roared, streamers and confetti was thrown. Everyone rejoiced as the new year had finally begun. Rachel, Sasha, and the rest of their family were ready for what lies ahead in the new year. No matter how many years go by, they'll always be there for the people they love. And Migo felt the same. Who knows what the new year holds for him and his friends? Now that he knows the world is much bigger than they could possibly imagine, Migo was ready for new beginnings in the new year. newbienovelistRD: Happy New Year, everyone! Welcome 2019! Whatever resolution you make, never forget the people who truly matter in your heart. The new year always holds many changes and wonder, but that's what makes it a time to celebrate!

DISCLAIMER: I own none of the characters that appear in this story. ... Migo stepped carefully through the town, making sure he didn't step on any Smallfoot. He waved and smiled at them as he went by, and most waved back. Everyone smiled. He came to the window of one home, where he could see a baby girl smallfoot inside. She seemed to be holding an even smaller creature in her arms. Some sort of feline , Migo thought. As he watched, the girl scratched the stomach, chest, and sides of her small feline as it stretched in her arms, and cooed something at it in smallfoot language. Wow , Migo thought. That feline really seems to enjoy that. It almost looks like how I hold my smallfoot … Migo stood up straight, suddenly excited. I wonder if Smallfoot would like it as much as the little feline? I have to try this! He dashed off (carefully) through the town, making his way to Smallfoot's home. When he arrived, Smallfoot had just come out of his home and was shutting the brown wood thing, which Meechee told him was a door, and didn't see Migo approach. \"There we go,\" Percy said, taking the key out of its keyhole and putting it in his pocket. He turned and jumped, breathing in sharply and bringing a hand to his chest. He smiled up at the yeti, laughing slightly. \"Hey there big guy,\" he said. \"You startled me.\" he moved to go past him, but the yeti blocked him and held his hand out flat. Slightly confused, Percy climbed on and sat down. \"Do you want to show me something?\" he asked. The yeti held him in his arms, pushing him down into the crook of his arm with one giant finger. Percy realized that the way he was being held was similar to how a mother would hold her baby. Was that how the yeti saw him? That was embarrassing. The yeti brought his finger close to Percy, wiggling it against his stomach. A smile twitched on his face. \"Ho-hold on there, big guy,\" Percy said, laughing slightly. \"What are you doing?\" the yeti smiled down at him, looking excited. He wiggled his finger faster against Percy's stomach and sides. Migo watched as Smallfoot moved under his finger, making happy sounding smallfoot noises. Occasionally he would shove his hands against Migo's finger, but the feline had done this as well, so Migo took it as a sign that he was doing it right. Percy laughed hysterically. \"Sto-hop!\" he wheezed. \"I ca-han't breaheathe !\" he felt himself growing weaker, and the yeti's face blurred above him. Percy watched his face morph from happiness to concern before his vision faded to black. \"Uh, Smallfoot?\" Migo gently touched the smallfoot's face. His chest rose and fell more evenly as a few minutes passed by, but he still didn't wake up. \"What do I do?\" He asked, looking down at Smallfoot with worry. \"I hope I didn't hurt him…\" he brightened. \"I know! Girlfoot! She'll be able to help him!\" He went to her house, walking as fast as he could without crushing everything in his path. When he arrived, he carefully knelt to the ground and tapped on her door. \"Coming,\" Brenda called, approaching the door. When she opened it, she was greeted by the male yeti holding Percy in his arms. When he saw her, the yeti gestured to Percy and mimed what Brenda assumed was fainting. \"He passed out? Why? What happened?\" she raised her arms in a gesture of her question. The yeti wiggled his finger against Percy's stomach, then mimed fainting again. \"You tickled him until he passed out from lack of air,\" Brenda realized. She smiled reassuringly, holding out her arms to take Percy from him. \"It's all right,\" she said as the yeti carefully put Percy into her arms. \"I'll take care of him. We'll come see you when he wakes up.\" she did her best to communicate her message with hand signals. The yeti seemed to get it, because he smiled and nodded before walking away. Brenda carried Percy inside her house and set him carefully on the couch. She grabbed a book and sat at the end, trapping his feet between her and the back of the couch. A few chapters into her book, Brenda felt Percy stir behind her. She set the book down and turned to face him. \"Hey there,\" she said gently. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Percy said, rubbing his eyes. \"What happened?\" \"Your yeti friend brought you to me,\" she said. \"Said you'd passed out.\" \"Oh.\" realization dawned on Percy's face. \"Yeah, I did.\" Brenda leaned back, crossing her back and looking at him sideways, a small smirk on her face. \"So… why didn't you tell me you were ticklish?\" Percy looked at her, suddenly noting his position on the couch. With Brenda sitting against his feet, it made getting off the couch feet first nearly impossible, unless he wanted to risk kicking Brenda. Which he did not . He could try sliding backwards… \"It just didn't come up,\" he said, looking away from her. \"Besides, I'm not that ticklish.\" \"Really? But that yeti showed me what he did. He tickled you here-\" she poked his side, right under his arm, and Percy jumped. \"-and here!\" she poked his ribs, provoking a quiet \"eep!\" Percy coughed nervously. \"I-is that so?\" he said, his voice higher than normal. Brenda watched him closely. \"Yeah,\" she said. She put a finger on her chin. \"Actually, now that I think about it, he was tickling you all along your side. Right here.\" she put her finger just below his arm, dragging it down his side to his ribs. \"Re-really,\" Percy squeaked out. \"That's interesting.\" he really wasn't liking the way Brenda was looking at him. \"I wonder if there's anywhere else you're ticklish,\" she said. \"Oh, I doubt it,\" Percy said quickly. \"I mean, I wouldn't know. Since it's impossible to tickle yourself and all.\" \"I'll test you then.\" before he could even blink, Brenda's hands were on him, her fingers wiggling into his sides. Percy shrieked, trying to shove her off. \"Noho! Brenda! Stop it!\" he cried out between his laughter. \"Nope!\" Brenda said, wiggling her fingers across his stomach. \"Too much fun.\" \"Fo-hor you!\" he said, tears streaming down his face. He tried to sit up to grab her arms, but Brenda put a hand on his chest and pushed him back down. \"Ah-ah-ah,\" she said. \"I'm not done with you yet!\" she put her fingers under his chin and wiggled them a bit. Percy snickered, and she smiled. \"Wow, you're ticklish everywhere! Stomach, sides, ribs, and under your chin. There's only one place left to try…\" Percy's eyes widened. \"No,\" he gasped. \"No, please Brenda! I'm begging you! Not that!\" \"I'm sorry Percy,\" Brenda said, moving to sit on his knees and grabbing his ankle. \"I have to know.\" \"Please!\" Percy begged as she began removing his shoes. \"I'll do anything!\" tossing his shoes to the floor, Brenda smiled at him in fake sympathy. \"I'm afraid the situation is beyond my control,\" she said. Holding his ankle, she scratched her fingers along the bottom of his foot. \"NHOHO!\" he shrieked, flailing wildly under her. \"Sto-hohop, sto-hop PLEASE!\" \"But I've barely started!\" Brenda protested. \"BrendaHAHA!\" \"Alright, alright.\" she released his ankle stood up, smirking at him. \"I had know idea you had it this bad.\" \"Well, it's not something I usually tell people,\" Percy said, still gasping slightly. He drew his knees into his chest. \"Never do that again!\" \"I make no promises,\" Brenda told him. \"Seeing you laugh like that is so much fun!\" Percy glared at her, crossing his arms. \"It is not .\" \"I'd watch that tone of I were you,\" Brenda said, wiggling her fingers at him. \"If you're going to be grumpy, I might have to cheer you up again.\" \"No!\" Percy shrieked, scrambling backwards. He fell over the arm of the couch with a loud thud , and Brenda laughed, covering her mouth with her hand. \"Are you okay?\" she managed to say between the laughter, offering him her hand. He glared at her, crossing his arms. \"Yes. no thanks to you .\" Brenda rolled her eyes. \"You gonna take my hand or not?\" Grumbling, Percy grabbed her hand and got to his feet. \"If you don't mind,\" he said, dusting himself off. \"I'm going to leave while I still have my dignity. I'll see you later.\" grinning mischievously, Brenda poked his side and watched as he jumped, letting out a small shriek. \"I think it's too late for dignity,\" she said, laughing as Percy turned bright red and marched out her door. Slamming the door closed behind him, Percy shoved his hands in his pockets and plotted ways for how to get revenge on Brenda. ","Summary":" I have nothing to say, so...

Also, my apologies in advance if I got any of the names wrong. Pretty sure the little girl Yeti is named Soozie, but this may be incorrect. Her mother I named Purna (free cookie to those who get the reference), but if she actually has a cognomen that I'm not aware of then my bad. Author's Note : I don't know what the crap I'm doing. This is 100% fan service for myself because I was daydreaming to this song: watch?v=8TJ0B2NXwjI That goes with the rescue sequence. This one partners with the aftermath of the avalanche: watch?v=UCWi5aFrU30 And this one completes the ending: watch?v=NFx2UrO6Hs4 For some reason, I tend to find interest in fictional characters that are annoying and/or slightly self-centered. Perhaps this stems from the belief that there's good in everyone... if you dig down far enough. Being a jerk is not excusable, but everyone deserves love. In Fleem's case, what if he put aside his fears and risked life and limb to help someone else besides himself for a change? November 12 - 3 Days Before \"The Incident\" Soozie clutched her chest. She was huffing and puffing. Forty feet was a bit of a climb, even for a young Yeti such as herself. The air was a bit thinner up here besides, but she'd seen him wander off by himself looking in a most morose state, and she simply couldn't let that fly. So up she clambered... Five more feet... Three more feet... One more foot... Finally . Soozie plopped onto the top of the ledge, looked back, and chuckled to herself. Even her best friend Ganie wouldn't have been able to climb this high! But as she turned around to face her next challenge, her smile fell. There he was - perched precariously on the edge of a precipice, feet dangling over the edge and legs rocking back and forth as a child would do, muttering to himself. It sounded like a pretty intense conversation. Soozie almost felt bad for interrupting it as she tip-toed up to him in the thick snow and carefully, veeeery carefully, poked him on the shoulder. \"AAAUGH!\" Fleem yelped, his already dangerous position jeopardized as he almost fell over the edge in shock. \"SOOZIE! What the f-frostbite, kid?! You wanna see me killed?!\" Not that it would have been a long fall. Fleem was exaggerating and he knew it, but he brushed down his fur indignantly regardless, a nervous habit he'd developed over the years and one that drove Kolka nuts. Sometimes he did it just for the pleasure of annoying her. Though a little taken aback, Soozie couldn't help but chuckle at Fleem's ridiculous behavior. Even she knew that he was basically the definition of the word \"dramatic\" in their village. \"You're so dramatic,\" Soozie chortled. \"Yeah, well, you're annoying. You know that's like... twenty feet down, right?\" \"Forty.\" \"Forty. Whatever. See? I could've died.\" Soozie, still giggling, shuffled closer to him... then stopped. Fleem frowned. She shuffled a little closer... then stopped again. Shuffle. Stop . Shuffle. Stop . What the heck was she doing...? Closer ... closer. PLOP . To Fleem's great displeasure she was now sitting right next to him, smiling and staring intensely up into his face as if awaiting an answer to a most important question. It was almost laughable. The directness of her gaze drew his eyes open wider and wider the longer she looked. If anyone was to walk in on them right now they might think a very violent staring contest was taking place. \"... What?\" Fleem finally inquired, blinking. \"Ha!\" Soozie blurted out, pointing at him. \"You lose!\" Fleem blinked again, nonplussed. \"Whut...?\" he asked again. \"You're not supposed to blink! Duh! Ha-ha!\" Fleem shot her the most deadpan look he could possibly give before averting his gaze and rolling his eyes. So it was a staring contest. But of course... \"Why do you come way up here?\" the little Yeti inquired. \"That's... none of your business,\" he lilted, arms crossed indignantly. \"Why not?\" \"Beee cauuuuse ... it's not?\" \"Why?\" \"Becau-... I don't know, man. Why do you care?\" \"Why don't you?\" \"I...\" She had him there. Almost. \"Listen, you wouldn't understand, all right?\" \"But don't you think they'll worry about you?\" \"Nobody worries about me...\" \"I do.\" He paused, head slowly turning to look at her, at two questioning eyes that genuinely showed concern. Something akin to guilt tugged at his innards. He didn't deserve that look. Most Yetis didn't like him and for good reason - he was annoying; a coward; quick to think of self over others. Even the S.E.S., despite welcoming him into their club, admitted that he was pretty horrible sometimes. Not that it bothered him much. He knew he could be a bit of a pill and just accepted it as such. No. He didn't blame the others for how they saw him, yet it didn't pull him away from his hiding spots any less. He never was much of a people person to begin with, and solitude was far more cathartic than anyone gave it credit, but then why did he feel so lonely? Why did he always try to compensate for lack of attention in the most unpleasant ways possible? Why was he like this? He snapped out of his thoughts to glance back at Soozie. She was still staring at him, waiting for... what? An answer? What was he to say? \"Thank you\"? \"Uhh... thanks..,\" came his weak reply. It was a pitiful attempt, but he supposed he owed her at least that. Hardly anyone ever actually said that they worried about him; that they cared. \"You're welcome,\" she smiled back. He didn't return the smile at first, not even after she jumped up and, quite out of nowhere, hugged him. \"You gonna come to the ice race?\" she asked. \"The... w-what?\" Fleem stumbled, still a little taken aback by the hug. \"We're having an ice race at my school today!\" Out from one of her poofy pigtails she pulled a very light, thin slab of rock and handed it to him. He took it. It had the name 'Fleem' scratched out on it. \"We're allowed one guest and you're mine, so you better show up,\" she said, only half-joking. An ominous rumble made them both gaze off into the distance. Foreboding clouds painted the distant sky black. It looked as though a storm was coming, and coming fast. \"I gotta go. My mom's gonna be mad. See ya'!\" Off she went, racing to the edge where she'd ascended with utmost haste. She disappeared for only a second before her head popped back up again. \"Don't be late!\" And just like that, she was gone. Fleem stared after her as she went, finally looking away to stare once more at the invitation. Despite himself, he smiled. November 15 - The Day of \"The Incident\" Fleem shut his eyes and shut them tight. It was a stupid move, but he did it anyway. He was running, running faster than he'd ever run before. Other Yetis, young and old, barely managed to keep up with his pace, but he could hear their screams, their yells, their shouts to run faster, faster ... Stupid. So stupid. It was ridiculous that such a thing had happened, and to their mountain no less. Storms were unwelcome, but not unusual. Fleem had seen his fair share of lightning and thunder in the short little life that he'd lived. There was nothing uncommon about the occasional snowstorm, and he'd been an observer of some pretty bad ones, but this? This was... different. For one thing, the main course of rumblings and flashes had come with a side of earthquakes. For another, the pick-up of snow and sleet, already thick enough in the intense winds to practically obscure everyone's vision, had graduated to hail. Two structures in the village were destroyed and Dorgle now had a broken leg for a souvenir. More incidents would have surely befell them had they not left. Kathmandu had already evacuated, Percy and Brenda being two of the few whom had absolutely insisted on staying despite the risk, the sole remainder of the humans amongst a sea of Yeti holed up in a cave at the base of the mountain. It was an emergency hide-out of sorts, far enough down and out of the way to serve as a reliable source of cover in case of an avalanche, though perhaps not the safest in an earthquake situation. It was this cave that Fleem ran into now, taking a spot in the back to slump against the wall and catch his breath. He wouldn't be surprised if he passed out from lack of air, he'd been panting so hard. Always the fastest in an emergency. That was him. If he was gonna die it was going to be from hyperventilation and most certainly not from a natural disaster. At least he could somewhat control how much he panicked. Having swallowed several buckets full of crisp, refreshing air, Fleem took a moment to take in the scene: The cave was filled to the brim with Yetis from the village, which was saying something taking into account the size of the place. Migo was tending to his father's broken leg, Percy at his side with a first aid kit. Meechee, always the compassionate soul, wasted no time in checking in on every Yeti in the vicinity, bringing them water, victuals, and anything else they'd managed to salvage from the villages. Kolka and Gwangi were doing their best to entertain and console the children, and Brenda was assisting Meechee. It was rather heartwarming, the fervency with which everyone came together in time of need. And him? He was sitting in a distant corner... alone. Better to be as far away from the danger and distress as possible. Besides, everyone else was doing such a bang up job of aiding others that he figured they wouldn't really need his help anyway. Fine by him. He never was a people person. A shadow appeared over him. He looked up. \"Hey, Fleem. You okay?\" It was Kolka, of all people. The one most annoyed by him was the first one to check in on him. The irony. \"Yeah..,\" he lied. \"It's pretty crazy, right?\" she sighed, taking a spot beside him. \"I can't believe we had to evacuate like this. I mean, I've seen some pretty bad storms before, but this is... insane.\" \"Yeah. Insane.\" \"I really hope everyone will be able to move back in. Guess we'll have to rebuild the S.E.S. headquarters, huh? Not that we need it now or anything.\" \"I kinda liked it... I miss my cot.\" \"Heh. Yeah. I miss the snails.\" As she said it, a fuzzy, orange, luminescent snail crawled up her back and over her shoulder. She smiled and tickled it. \"At least we were able to bring a couple with us.\" \"Hey, Kolka...?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Do you think I'm a...\" But the last word stuck to his tongue. He cursed himself privately. Come on. Just say it. \"... a jerk?\" Kolka frowned a little, but didn't answer immediately. \"Why would you say that?\" \"I dunno. I know I'm not the most... 'fuzzy' person. All you guys are so good at helping people and I'm just... not really that. And I don't know why.\" There was a pause as he mulled all this over. The entire time he refused to look Kolka in the eye. \"I'm sorry I'm..,\" he gulped. \"I'm sorry I'm me...\" Kolka stared at him. Surprisingly, a smile lit up her face. She sighed and rested a hand on his shoulder. \"Fleem, just because you're not the 'fuzziest' person doesn't mean that we don't care about you. Okay, you can be a little annoying, yeah, and maybe you might want to think about what you say before you say it, but... I don't think you're a jerk. At least not a total one,\" she nipped playfully, bumping his arm. \"I'm not a people person,\" he dragged, still not entirely convinced. \"I'm not either. S.E.S. helped break me out of my shell a little bit, but I still value my alone time too, ya' know. Didn't stop me from advocating for you, though.\" That made him look up. \" You were the one to vouch for me..?\" \"Yup. A seriously grave error on my part, mind you. If I'd known you were gonna tease me so much I probably would have had second thoughts,\" Kolka joked. \"Seriously, though, I told Meechee myself that we should invite you. I think you kinda needed some friends anyway.\" \"You... consider me a friend?\" \"Well, duh. I didn't come over here to stare at the snow, dude. Are we really that serious?\" Fleem's mouth twitched stubbornly in a would-be smile. They cared about him. Actually cared about him. Perhaps he really had been overthinking things. A distant call of distress snapped them both to attention as a panicked figure wove through the crowd. \"Soozie! Soozie, answer me, sweet heart!\" Kolka and Meechee answered the call almost simultaneously, both stopping in front of the worried mother. \"What's wrong, Purna?\" Meechee asked. \"Well, I... I thought I brought her with me, but I've been looking everywhere and can't find her!\" \"Did you try the human village?\" Kolka offered helpfully. Purna shook her head. \"I don't see any reason why she'd go there. All the bunkers are closed off.\" \"Did she mention anything before you left?\" asked Meechee. \"Um... Well, she did mention something about... Oh, what was it...? School. Yes, she wanted to bring something from the school.\" Purna's eyes grew wide as realization dawned on her. \"Oh, Meechee... You don't think she's...?\" \"She's still up there?\" Kolka finished Purna's thought as all three Yetis slowly turned on the spot to stare out the entrance to the cave. There was no way... Unable to kick back his curiosity any longer, Fleem pulled himself up from his sitting position and stepped up to the party of three. \"What's up?\" he asked. \"Soozie's in the village,\" said Kolka. \"Oh. Well, she's probably in the... bucket...? Bunker? Whatever it's calle-\" \"The Yeti village , Fleem,\" Kolka emphasized, cutting him short. \"Oh...\" \"I need to go find her,\" insisted Purna, but Meechee held her back. \"Even with a companion it would be too dangerous. You need a search party.\" \"I don't know if we can spare even that, guys,\" Migo said, stepping up. Obviously, he'd been listening in. \"Half of the clan is exhausted from the trip and most of the others are too scared to even leave the cave.\" \"We can't just leave her up there,\" Kolka countered. \"What's going on?\" asked Brenda, Percy in tow. Like snow blowing through the pines, the news of Soozie's disappearance traveled swiftly and stuck fast. Soon, the entire cave was ripe with chatter. Questions poured in and out. Who should go? How would a rescue attempt be carried out? Was it even safe to send anyone up the mountain at this point...? Fleem heard none of it. He was standing at the entrance to the cave, looking up into the deep abyss of wind, snow, and mist where, somewhere, there lay their home in the mountains. Soozie was up there. Alone. She could be hurt. She could be dying... He looked back at the tangled mess of Yetis that fussed over what should be done. Why didn't anyone just... go up and get her? What were they all waiting for? A conversation, three days old at its peak, floated suddenly into his head as if in response to the situation. He could replay it as clearly as if he was back on that precipice near the village. \"But don't you think they'll worry about you?\" \"Nobody worries about me...\" \"I do.\" He stared up at what he could not see, but what he knew was there. He could almost hear her reply. It was calling him; pulling him... He didn't realize he was running until the full blast of the storm hit him some ten feet up the mountain. Kolka's shouts to return chased him, slapped him, bit at him, but he heeded them not. He just kept running. He had to. The gong was ringing, yet there was no sun to be seen. Its once stable foundations, unsettled by the rumbling of the earth in all its frustration, teetered on a narrow precipice, every threat of its dismantlement certain to transpire at any moment. Structures lay in ruins throughout the village, some shattered by rocks, others upended at their base by the earthquake. Remnants of a panicked exodus manifested itself in the form of dropped sacks, frenzied tracks in the snow, and the occasional tuft of fur caught on the edge of the surrounding wall. What had once been a thriving community had been reduced to a pile of stones and rubbish in a matter of hours. A booming hail of thunder was quickly answered by a flash of lightning. It rent the scalded atmosphere, like a curtain ripped in two, and lit up the frightened eyes of a frozen and terrified Soozie. It had occurred to her some minutes ago that hiding in her family's house was, perhaps, not exactly the best option. Some of the homes had already caved in or had their entrances blocked from the outside. It was only a matter of time before hers suffered the same fate. Easier said than done , she thought. There was no way she'd reach the bottom of the mountain at this point, not without the risk of losing what she'd come back here to get at any rate, but perhaps there was an alternative? As she sat huddled against the wall of her house, wide-eyed at the desolation taking place right in front of her, she scanned about for a more secure location. Migo's tower? Pretty much destroyed at this point, and going higher up didn't improve her odds. The school? Oh, that's right. A boulder had fallen on top of it. The Stonekeeper's cave...? Now that was an idea. It went deep into the cliffs, had tons of rooms to hide in, and was one of the few areas without a blocked entrance... currently. That would have to do. \"Okay, Soozie. You can do this. You just gotta make a run for it,\" she muttered, steeling herself up for the inevitable. She'd have to sprint it and be darn quick about it, too. Rocks were still falling. Any one of them could hit her. She took several quick breaths - in, out, in, out, in, out - and shuffled her feet into position, hand clutched tight on her trinket. Thunder growled again, closer this time. It was now or never. Out she sprinted, running as fast as her little legs could carry her, dodging a broken house here, a boulder there, running and running and running, faster and faster and faster! She reeled back as a flash of lightning struck a geode near her feet, scattering it into a thousand colors of ruby, jade, and turquoise. She would have considered it rather beautiful to watch if she hadn't almost been killed in the process. Not without some effort, she pulled herself back onto her feet, panting in shock at the near-death experience as she practically flew towards the Stonekeeper's cave. Just a little bit further...! She made it, and not a moment too soon. A boulder smashed down where she'd been standing just seconds before. It might as well have caused an earthquake of its own, the impact of it was so intense. Soozie ran into the cave a little ways, bothering to look back at the wreckage for only a moment before taking the path that led deeper and deeper into its mouth... Fleem didn't even realize that he was at the entrance to the village until he was literally right outside of it. The snow and fog had allowed him only ten feet of vision at most the entire climb up. Even worse, when he stepped up to the opening, he noticed that there were several large boulders blocking enough of the pathway as to make an easy walk through impossible. There was nothing for it but to climb up and over. Stupid .., Fleem thought to himself again. All of this was nuts. Kolka had said it best: Insane. \"You're gonna get yourself killed!\" she'd yelled as he foolishly plunged into his rash decision. She was probably right. Whatever. Whether he died or not, that wasn't the point. Fleem clapped his hands together. \"All right. Let's do this.\" Up and over. Up and over. \"Stupid rocks. Stupid... snow. Ahh. Phew... I need to work out...\" He made it. Or did he? As he landed at the base of the rocks, his jaw dropped. Nearly everything was destroyed. It looked as though a tornado had taken a joyride through the village. If anything was still standing it certainly wasn't going to be much longer. The only somewhat-intact structure was the Stonekeeper's cave, and even that had a sizeable boulder chilling out at the entrance. He sincerely hoped that Soozie wasn't underneath one of these rocks... \"Soozie!\" he called out. Could she even hear him in this din? \"SOOOOZIEEE!\" Nothing. Frantically, he checked the likely places she might be. But there was no Soozie at her house, no Soozie near the school (but of course she wasn't...), no Soozie anywhere. The only other residence that seemed even remotely suitable as a hiding spot was standing right in front of him. Taking a deep breath, he ran into the Stonekeeper's cave. Fleem rubbed his arms, partially due to the cold, partially out of nerves. He'd never done anything this reckless before. That time he'd replaced Kolka's pillow with a bag of Pardosa bernensis didn't even come close to this. He was gonna die. He just knew it. 'Here lies Fleem. He died doing the stupidest thing any of us have ever done.' \"Soozie! SOOZIE, are you in here?!\" Still nothing. \"SOOZIEEEEEE!\" Had she really gone that far back into the caves? Only one way to find out. He plunged into its depths, rounding corners and taking steep stairs that led, he knew, into the heart of their history. All had been exposed at this point, of course, but he still couldn't help but pause to look once more upon the incredible paintings, structures, and engravings that catalogued what had led to their living atop this mountain in the first place. It was impressive, the amount of work put in by their ancestors to erase what had been written. Insane. Pulling himself away from a particularly intricate painting, he wandered further into the cave, right to the very end where the huge, Yeti-powered mechanism that once formed a massive cover of clouds around their mountain lay dormant and abandoned. The thing was huge. Impressive. So very impressive... Sniff. What was that? Fleem turned in the direction of the noise, to a corner of the room hidden in shadow. He walked towards it; rounded a corner... \"Soozie...?\" There she was, hugging her legs for emotional support, one hand clasped tightly about something that he couldn't see. She gasped at his appearance, jumped up, and FLUNG herself into his arms, burying her face in his fur. He toppled over, the force of her hug landing him, hard , onto the ground. He bit his lip to prevent himself from yelling in pain into her face. \"Mmmmmmm...!\" he moaned. Gosh, that hurt... \"Oh! Eheh. Sorry..!\" Soozie gasped, reeling back and smiling apologetically. She offered a hand to help him up, which he accepted, rubbing his butt as he stood. \"I thought everybody went back down the mountain?\" she asked, confused. \"Did you get stuck, too?\" \"No, I... came up here to get you.\" \"Oh. Is my mom okay?\" \"She's fine, but they're worried as heck about you, kid. What are you doing up here?\" \"I forgot to get this.\" And lifting up her palm she showed him several very round, very pretty-looking rocks, or perhaps not so much rocks as pieces that had been meticulously cut from a geode or crystal and smoothed out. They were handsome little things. \"They're for my mom. I worked a long time on them.\" \"You came all the way up here... for a rock ?\" \"It's for my mom!\" she retorted, frowning indignantly. \"Kid, I almost died getting up here.\" \"You always say that,\" she countered. He was about to argue back when the ground began to shake beneath them. Another earthquake? Sure enough, a split in the stone floor broke through to snake its way towards their feet at an alarmingly fast rate. \"RUN!\" Fleem screamed, heading in the only opening available to them. At the very back of the cave was a large opening in the wall. It looked out onto the vast expanse of cliffs and land below... and it also went straight down. The two diminutives stopped right at the edge. It would be foolish to jump. They looked back. A large chunk of ceiling had broken off to SMASH into pieces just feet from them, and the crack in the floor was continuing to weave its merry way in their direction. It would be foolish not to jump. \"Uhhhh... Crap... Hold on tight, kid!\" Jumping up and onto his shoulders, Soozie grabbed hold about Fleem's neck just as he closed his eyes and plunged off the edge. Soozie screamed. Fleem screamed louder. This was not cool. This was NOT cool... They landed with a PLOP in the snow some fifty feet below, leaving behind a perfect impression of their silhouette. Fleem was surprised it hadn't been a longer fall, and as he popped his head out of their little self-made hole he quickly made to scramble out, helping Soozie immediately after. \"We gotta go,\" he said, pulling her rather roughly in his wake. There was an urgency in his voice that had nothing to do with the thunder, or the lightning, or the storm. Upon their landing, he had heard it: the sound of heavy white blankets shifting in their slumber; the unmistakable warning to run. \"Mr. Fleem, I can't keep up!\" Soozie yelled, losing a hold of his grasp as she fell back into the snow. Fleem stopped immediately, ran back, and plopped her up onto his shoulders once more. \"Soozie, whatever you do, DON'T let go.\" \"Okay..,\" she obeyed. She'd better if she's going to survive this , Fleem thought. Running to the nearest tree, he ripped off a sizeable slab of hard bark and began racing down the hill with it. It wasn't the sturdiest wood, but it would have to do. Once he'd gathered enough speed, he jumped onto the bark, taking a kneeling position with both hands firmly clasped onto the sides of the makeshift snowboard. They'd have to really kick up some snow to outstrip what was coming. At least Soozie provided some much-needed weight. Leaning down as far as he could, with Soozie handing on tight, they began to pick up more speed, weaving this way and that between the trees as a steady rumble grew louder and louder behind them. They didn't want to look back, they couldn't afford to look back, but they had to... Soozie gasped . Fleem could only stare, wide-eyed. Oh my gosh ... It seemed as if the entire mountain had broken free of its suffering and was tumbling downwards with the utmost ferocity, determined to swallow them whole. And consumed they would be if they failed to reach the base. \"Watch out!\" Soozie yelped. Fleem swiveled back around just in time to see a tree coming towards them. He veered sharply left, barely grazing the giant spruce as they continued to plunge ever downward. Soozie kept look back. Whole pines were being eaten alive by the oncoming hoard of snow. An occasional squirrel or fox tried to avoid the inevitable, their failure nothing more than another unfortunate speck of dust in the whirlwind that consumed all in its path. It was amazing... and terrifying. Fleem was keeping his eyes peeled for the cave at the bottom. He knew they must be close. He looked back. Not dang close enough. \"Mr. Fleem?!\" Soozie cried. Was it just Fleem's imagination or was she slipping? \"WHAT?!\" \"I can't hold on!\" Sure enough, she was slipping. \"Both hands, man! Both hands!\" \"I can't! Mom's present!\" Those darn rocks... \"Drop them!\" he yelled at her. \"But it-\" \"DROP THEM!\" A pause. Fleem felt a little tug as Soozie flung out her arm behind her for a spell before grabbing back onto him with both hands. She said nothing. It took him a few seconds before he realized that she was crying. An entire mountain was trying to kill them and she was worried about the rocks? Kids were incredible. He rolled his eyes and peeled his eyes for a sign of a crevice... a peak... a rock... Anything . And suddenly, almost as if he'd wished it out of thin air, there it was, looming in the distance: the base. He almost yelped aloud in ecstasy. About dang time! He looked behind him. Oh... The avalanche was literally almost at their toes. They were only just going to make it. Well... she was. He made his decision in a matter of seconds, for that was all the time he had. \"KOLKA!\" Fleem yelled. \"KOLKAAAA! MEECHEE!\" They heard him. God bless 'em, they heard him. Kolka and Meechee appeared at the entrance. Even from here he could tell they were relieved to see them. \"FLEEM!\" Kolka shouted. He pointed with urgency at Soozie on his back, hoping she would understand. Her face dropped. Fleem looked behind him. \"Kid, gimme your hand!\" \"Why?!\" \"Just do it!\" But Soozie wasn't fooled. \"You too!\" \"Not me! There's only time for you!\" \"No way! I'm not doing it!\" Stupid kid. They were running out of time. He had to do everything. He grabbed her by the hand. \"Wait..!\" she protested, but it was no use. Kolka, you'd better catch her... As they sped by the entrance to the base, Fleem threw Soozie at Kolka with all his might. She caught her... and not a moment too soon. It wasn't a second, maybe two, after he'd passed the base that the avalanche overtime him, and he was plunged into a world of nothingness. He couldn't see, he couldn't think, he couldn't breath. The last thing he'd ever lay eyes on would be an endless blanket of white. Whatever , he thought. That wasn't the important thing... \"FLEEM!\" Kolka yelled. \"Fleem..!\" But no one answered her call. An hour had passed since the avalanche concluded its deadly descent, finally stopping about a third of the way into the human village below. It had taken everyone in the emergency base forty minutes just to dig their way out of the aftermath, even thought only a small portion of it had spilled into the cave. When they finally emerged, it was a different world. Aside from all the snow, one might never had known that there had ever been a storm in the first place - the skies were clear as day, with only a few lingering clouds remaining as evidence that anything had happened at all, and the wind had died down significantly. Part of the town, of course, was completely covered, and the Yeti village at the peak would require some major renovation, but, aside from that, all was peaceful. And quiet. A little too quiet. It was rather eerie. \"FLEEM! Fleem, answer me, man!\" Kolka hollered again, undeterred. Meechee, Gwangi, Purna, and Migo were searching too, with Soozie checking behind still-standing trees, while the rest of the troop took in the decimation. Soozie searched with fervor, but no one was more determined to find their lost member than Kolka. She overlooked nothing and, sure enough, she was the first to see the bark. The very tip of it was sticking up out of the snow near a small cluster of trees, and she pulled with all her might to reveal... nothing. She looked down. The area was caked with snow, just like every other part of the mountain. She swallowed hard... and started digging. Gwangi and Migo soon caught on to what Kolka was doing, rushing over to assist. No one said a word. They just kept digging... and digging... and digging. And sure enough... Kolka paused to look at the others for a moment, before directing her gaze back at where they'd dug. Slowly, carefully, she reached down. Soozie, Purna, and Meechee jogged over just then, stopping quite abruptly as they reached the small group. Kolka was holding Fleem in her arms. He looked as peaceful as if he'd fallen asleep right then and there in the snow. But she knew better than to think that. They all did. \"Fleem, you idiot...,\" Kolka choked, her mutter barely audible. Soozie simply stared. Half a minute passed. Without a word, she walked up to her friend. Yes, she'd considered him a friend. It would have made no sense to him, perhaps, and he probably hadn't seen her the same way, but that didn't matter to her. She looked up into Kolka's eyes, which mirrored her own: watery. Then, in one movement, she stepped forward and hugged her friend. No one had anything to say. They only wanted to give: give a last hug to their friend; embrace each other. Kolka's arms shook slightly as she held what had once been an annoying little Yeti in her arms. It was... surreal. Of all their number who could have suffered a casualty, it was the one least likely to put himself in danger. What in the world had happened to make him do something like this - to change? Soozie didn't want to let go. Kolka sighed. She pitied the kid, but they couldn't bury her with him either. \"Soozie... We have to let him go...,\" Kolka whispered. The little Yeti shook her head wordlessly, tears falling into his cold fur. Young as she was, she felt, to some degree, that she'd caused this. If she hadn't gone back for the rocks... \"Soozie, it's not your fault,\" said Kolka comfortingly. But she shook her head all the more, holding onto Fleem as if her life depended on it... for it had. An arm wrapped around her. She appreciated Kolka trying to console her, but it wasn't going to bring him back. Someone gasped. Several Yetis did, actually. Soozie was curious as to what was going on, but refused to let go. And neither, it seemed, did he. Wait... She pulled back a touch. His eyes were still closed, but he was breathing... He was breathing! And he was hugging her! Soozie hugged him back with renewed vigor. Kolka gaped at the scene. So did everyone else. Then she broke into a wide smile... and laughed. That did it. He opened his eyes. The first thing he saw was the sky... then Soozie... then Kolka. He looked quite confused. \"Am I dead?\" he asked blankly. \"You were!\" Soozie laughed, hugging him again. He directed his questioning gaze back to Kolka. \"What happened...?\" came his weak inquiry. Kolka didn't say a word. Perhaps it was because her cheeks were hurting from smiling so much. All she could do was hug him. He returned it... tightly . Gwangi, Migo, and the others all breathed a sigh of relief. Purna joined her daughter, kneeling down beside Fleem as he slowly sat up. She took his hand. \"Thank you. Thank you for saving my daughter.\" \"No sweat...,\" he smiled. \"I'm not even gonna question how you survived that,\" Kolka joked. \"I would,\" Gwangi said, but his tone was light. \"Don't ever scare me like that again, man,\" she said. \"Can't make any promises,\" Fleem smirked. Slowly, the little group got up and made their way back to the troop, Soozie holding Fleem's hand the entire time. December 31 - Over a Month After \"The Incident\" Nothing was ever the same. Both villages had been restored to some state of \"liveability\". There was still a lot of work to be done, especially for the Yetis, but no one was alone in their tasks. Everyone, snowman and human alike, had joined forces to help rebuild each other's homes and lives. In many respects, the days went on as they always had. But for two in particular, life had quite changed... Soozie gave herself a little extra push as she reached the top of the ledge. She'd gotten quite good at it over the last few weeks. Forty feet up wasn't as bad as she'd thought. Making sure not to upend the little backpack she was carrying, she skipped over to the edge of the precipice and plopped down next to Fleem. \"Here ya' go. One decough aaaaand... one hot chocolate,\" Soozie said cheerfully, handing Fleem a tumbler of the former and keeping the latter for herself. Hot chocolate. It was some kind of sweet drink that the humans were really fond of. Soozie liked it, too; had become kind of obsessed with it, in fact. \"It's de caf ,\" Fleem corrected her, smirking. \"Whatever,\" Soozie playfully nipped back. They both took a sip of their respective drinks. It was a beautiful day out. \"Think we'll see a rainbow today?\" Soozie asked hopefully. \"Maybe.\" \"I want to see two.\" \"No such thing.\" \"You're so funny,\" she chuckled. \"Hey, Fleem?\" \"Hm?\" \"Are you my friend?\" He smiled and shuffled close to her. \"Yeah.\" Soozie wrapped an arm around him, leaning her head against his side. The sun was rising, and they were the only ones watching. THE END Ending Notes : I never intended for the story to get this long, but it kind of spoke for itself as I was writing it. Stories tend to do that, I think. Originally, I was just gonna kill Fleem off, but I wanted to tie the ending together better than that. Soozie asking Fleem, \"Are you my friend?\" is a nod to my late uncle. He used to always say, \"Are you my friend?\". He was my favorite. I miss him a lot.

Story-Past-3 years before \" Wow. And now \" I chuckled softly at the sound of Midnight Marks calm voice, as the Kinks came blaring threw our speakers. Steve glared at me, and I looked down at the car floor, guiltily. It was like I couldn't smile anymore without his permission. Not that I have much to smile about. I closed my eyes, and rested my head back on the car seat, as Steve started to lecture me about how if it was his choice, I wouldn't even be going to see that scumbag, and that he was going to do everything in his power to make sure I come back home safely. I just acknowledged him the right places. Truth be told, it doesn't make a difference where I stay. I'm still going to have an overprotective adult, looking after me, saying what's right for me, and what isn't. Even in our last few days together, Steve doesn't do something fun , he calls lawyers, to find out his options. I had to pack alone, I had to hang out on my own. I even spent my final evening alone, watching TV. Of course, I didn't point this out to Steve. I wouldn't want our last few minutes together to be bad ones. I stared out the window, the rain dripping down the pane, as Steve's voice became more fainter and distant, until, along with the car, he stopped altogether. We sat in the car for a couple of minutes, in silence, the rain pit-patting on the car roof. Steve drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, and I was pretty certain that he would do a sharp turn, and drive off at full speed ahead, basically kidnapping me. He didn't though. Instead, he got out, cursing underneath his breath. I stayed in the car, and stared at the swinging picture, hanging from the rearview mirror. It's a picture of me and Mum, when I was much younger. My actual father must've taken the picture. I stared at crumpled picture, my mothers bright eyes and smile staring back into my own, blankly. Photographs are just freezed pictures. They can't actually look into your eyes. \"LAURIE! ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME OR WHAT?\" I pocketed the picture, and rushed outside, sliding my hood over my black hair. But that didn't do any good, as the wind just blew straight down again. I helped unload my one suitcase, so why he needed help, is a puzzle. I hugged my arms together and looked over my shoulder. There were 4 men, staring at me. I looked back, and saw Steve's outstretched arms. I hugged him, so tightly, that I could literally feel his heat moving. Steve chuckled and kissed the top of my head. He pushed me away slightly, even though I didn't want to let go. I felt like a 7 year old, rather than a 17 year old. \"Come on Laur, I'll help you onto the boat\" Steve picked up the suitcase and wiped his eyes. Whether it was from the rain, or they were tears, I didn't know. I tucked my hands into my pockets, and followed suit. I stepped into a puddle, and groaned, my leg suddenly become more colder. The boatman held onto my luggage, as Steve helped me on the boat. I took my luggage and held onto it. \"Where to Miss Torson?\" I almost flinched at that name. It was my mothers maiden name. I never liked it, and I had always planned to change it when I was old enough. But now...It's one of the few things I have left of my Mum. I nodded and waved goodbye to Steve, until he was nothing more than a distant figure on shore. I turned to face forward. The rain was dying down, but the wind was still crazy. I looked down, my fingers red and numb. I heard a yell from one of the boatmen. I gave him a blank look and turned to face where he was pointing. I almost fell off the boat. The ship was more larger than I had expected. It was old, and the red paint was peeling off, and was being replaced by rust. Along the side, sprawled in large white letters, said the words RADIO ROCK . I blinked for a while, before realising there was a ladder. I climbed up, holding my suitcase tightly, praying that it wouldn't suddenly fall open, leaving me clotheless. I breathed a small sigh of relief when it didn't. After yelling 3 times that I was here to see some man named Quentin, the man on deck led me indoors. The corridors were chilly, and my legs were aching as we went up another set of steep stairs. The man guided to the furthest door, at the end. The man opened the door, and I stepped in, silently thanking him. The room was huge, but cosy. In the middle of the room, was a long table. Lightshades hung from the ceiling, and at the very end of the room, stood a large bed. Papers were stacked everywhere, on the table, on the floorboards, even on the miniature bar. At the opposite end of the room, stood a large skinny man, with welcoming eyes, and a very stylish suit. He outstretched his arms, spilling some of his drink on the carpet. \"Lauren\" \"Laurie\" \"Laurie. How are you?\" I raised an eyebrow at him and replied, \"Fine\" This, of course, was a lie. The man, who I can only assume is Quentin, strided over to me, and bent down to my eye level, as if I was inspecting me. This made me nervous, and twitchy. Quentin smiled, and said, \"I don't like liars\" There was an awkward silence. Quentin stood up straight, and walked back over to the other side of the room. \"So...Wendy's dead?\" I blinked hard,and nodded. Quentin took a sip of his drink. \"Awful. Such a beautiful woman. She was my first love you know?\" I just looked at him. He walked back over to me, and said, \"You don't speak much do you?\" I shook my head. \"Not with new people. Or old friends. In fact, I'd rather stay quiet, than talk\" Quentin smiled a little. \"So...your mother's request, in her will, is to stay with your father, until you're old enough to make your own desicions?\" I smiled. \"Yes. If that's you, then yes\" Quentin smiled, and said, \"Spectactular mistake. Still, I suppose we better keep her happy\" He strided over to me once more, and stood by my side. I barely reached his shoulder. \"Suppose you better meet the others. Lucky for you, they're still awake\" Quentin picked up my luggage and threw it into some random room, as we walked downstairs, into the living area, which was filled with chatter and smoke. When we walked in, the laughter stopped, and was replaced by stares. It was like, we walked into the room, and everyone had turned to stone. Quentin leaned on the stair banister and said calmly, \"Can I introduce to you all, my daughter, Laurie?\" Nobody spoke. They still stared. I looked down sheepishly, and saw my black hair fall into my face. I saw Quentin stamp his foot lightly, and I looked up, as he pointed to the others. \"Dave, Thick Kevin, Felicity, John, Angus and Simon. Marks recording, Bobs sleeping and Gavins...probably drowned or something\" I chuckled smally. Still, no one spoke, until Dave suddenly exclaimed, \"Your what the fuck?\" A skinny boy, Thick Kevin, hit his arm. Dave raised his hands innocently. I smiled. Felicity, who was easy to spot because she was a) the only woman and b) wrist deep in dough, looked at me with sincere concern, and asked in a lovely voice, \"Can you speak dear?\" I blinked at her. I smiled, a devious plan bursting into my mind. I smiled sadly and shook my head. Everyone in the room gasped, whereas Quentin just raised an eyebrow. I winked at him, and he said nothing. As the others crowded round me, handing me a pen and paper, I couldn't help but laugh. They sat me down, and handed me a Coke. \"Is there anything else you want?\" Felicity asked, after a half hour of fretting. I looked at Quentin, who crossed his arms, and gave me a stern look. I smiled and looked at her. \"Yes there is one thing\" Everyone gasped. I pushed my hair back and carried on speaking, \"Can I have a straw please?\" Felicity walked off, muttering angrily to herself. The Count ruffled my hair, and said in his American accent, \"I like her\" I smiled and stood up. \"I'm tired. I'm going to go to bed\" I walked past everyone, and figured I'd be the topic of conversation. I didn't bother waiting around though. I headed up the stairs, and tried to remember what room Quentin had chucked my suitcase in. I looked in on every room, not recognising my suitcase. But, I didn't even get a chance to look in Gavins room. I peeked round the door, and saw something I didn't need to see. I quickly shut the door, and blushed. Gavin opened his room, and looked at me. He leaned on the doorframe, and tilted his head to one side, inquiringly. \"Who the bloody hell are you?\" I made sure I stayed looking right into his eyes, and not...lower. \"I'm Laurie\" \"Aren't you a little young to be on this ship?\" I smiled. \"It's the 60s. It's rock n roll. Am I to young to rock?\" Gavin smiled. \"Seriously...what are you doing here?\" I didn't say much. I just walked away, looking into other rooms. I didn't hear a door shut. Instead, when I turned to look, Gavin was still looking at me, curiously. I rolled my eyes, and looked into the final room. My suitcase was in there, so I went in, changed into my pajamas and clicked the light shut, before burrowing under my duvet, questions filling my mind. What's tomorrow going to be like? How am I going to survive here? And more importantly...what was Mum thinking ? So...what do you guys think? Rate & Review? Please and thank you :)[Chapter 2] The Dark Side of Rock N Roll. Chapter Two-The government, Sausages and Curtains. Present Time-3 years on As the sunlight beamed into my room, I couldn't help but wonder why the fuck I haven't got curtains. Everyone else seems to have curtains. Bob has really thick curtains. So why the hell haven't I got any? I tried to stay asleep, but it was too late. Mother Nature had, once again, beaten me. I groaned, and got out of bed, cursing Miss Nature, and headed downstairs, where I could smell something cooking. Which could either be good...or bad. I entered the living/dining area, where Felicity, Mr Thicko, and The Count were already up. I gave them all a silent hello, and headed into the kitchen to find something edible. \"Um, Laurie\" I turned, and faced Felicity, who was looking at me like I had done something terrible. I just stared at her, until she carried on speaking. \"We're having sausages\" The Count folded his newspaper, and started to look at us, scratching his beard. I can't imagine him without a beard. I looked at the frying pan, where there was indeed, sausages cooking. They were burnt, but they were cooking. \"So I see\" I replied bluntly. \"Don't you want any?\" \"Not particularly\" \"Why?\" \"I don't like them\" The Count laughed and interjected in the conversation, \"That's not what I've heard\" I gave him a mocking laugh, before turning back to the fridge. Sometimes, people on this boat, can get so fucking defensive. Just the other day, I asked Kevin whether or not he liked his nickname, and he yelled at me. It wasn't even a relevant topic to the conversation, he was yelling at me about seagulls. And sometimes, on those rare occasions, I wonder what it would've been like, if I left with Steve on my 18th birthday. I poured myself a glass of juice, and left the room. I stole a packet of who's ever cigarettes were lying around, and headed out to the deck. It was a nice day, so I sat in one of the chairs, lit my cigarette, and stared out into the open ocean, soaking up the sun. I heard Angus put more Seekers on, and I rolled my eyes. I can handle Angus. He's just...so not funny. \"Ah..so that's where my cigarettes went\" I turned round and smiled at Gavin. \"They're not even nice cigarettes\" I said. Gavin just smiled. For some reason, ever since that first day we met, Gavin had some sort of respect for me. Whether it was because I walked in on him shagging some girl, and acted like I didn't care, or because the next day I told everyone, I'll never know. Maybe both. \"What's pissed you off?\" Gavin asked, as he lit his cigarette. I blew some smoke out and asked, \"What?\" \"You never come out here alone, unless you're pissed off\" \"I'm not alone though. You're here\" Gavin raised an eyebrow. \"That contradictory, tough-bitch attitude gets tiresome, you know that right?\" I laughed and stumped my cigarette into the ash-tray. \"You love it\" Gavin nodded and laughed. I sipped my juice, and sat in silence for a minute, before turning to him, and exclaiming, \"Curtains\" Gavin looked at me confused. \"Begging your pardon?\" \"Curtains. I haven't fucking got any. I wake up at the crack of dawn, no matter what time I go to bed the night before, because for some reason, I haven't got any curtains\" He raised an eyebrow. \"Is that it?\" \"Don't give me that look! You try spending the night in my room!\" Gavin gave me a strange look, before smirking. \"Okay. But I must warn you, I snuggle up and sleep naked. And I'd prefer it if you were naked as well\" I slapped him upside the head. Gavin's always flirting with me, but I've never thought much of it. One, everyone else does it, aside Quentin, because he's my Dad, Carl because he's sweet and shy, and Kevin, because...well I hardly doubt he'd even know how to. Oh and Felicity, because I'm straight and she's...not. Not that there's anything wrong with that. And two, Gavin's too old for me, and is also like one my best friends. It'll be too weird. We heard the heavy door open, and out came a long line of people. Dave, who made his presence known by yelling, \"OI, OI LOVEBIRDS\" in which Gavin's response was to push him. Dave was followed by Mark, who gave me a silent wave. I smiled and nodded. Carl soon followed suit, as did Quentin. Felicity came out with the sausages, and The Count and Kevin followed her. As I looked around me, everyone chatting and laughing, I remember why I didn't go with Steve that day. These guys are way more fun. \"Laurie, pass me the ketchup\" The Count asked, as he threw down one of his cards. I stared at him, and he sighed. \"Fucking please \" I grinned, and handed him the bottle. \"You don't need to say 'fuck' all the time you know\" I said, as he squirted most of the ketchup out. Obviously not hearing what I just said, Count cursed under his breath. I rolled my eyes, and turned back to face whoever was there to talk to. \"Darling,\" Quentin said. I looked at him, and replied in my innocent voice, \"Yes Daddy?\" \"Where was you yesterday?\" I frowned. Gavin turned to look at me, before looking back at Quentin, as I was. \"On the boat\" \"Okay. Let me rephrase. Where was you on the boat?\" \"I was on the deck. With Gavin, Carl and Dave\" Quentin looked at the three men for confirmation. They all nodded, and Quentin looked back at me. He just nodded, before leaving the table. We all looked at his skinny figure leave, before turning to give each other 'What-The-Hell-Just-Happened' looks. \"Has Laurie been a bad girl?\" Dave asked. I threw a sausage at him, and he caught it in his mouth. I rolled my eyes, and turned to Carl. \"So Carl\" He looked up from his food and smiled. \"So Laurie\" I grinned. Because me and Carl are close enough in age, I always felt he was like a brother to me. We always seem to tell each other what life was like back on shore. I've told Carl things I haven't told many people. Why? Because Carl has a trustworthy face. And that's good enough for me. \"Enjoying your sausage?\" Carl dropped his knife and fork, and glared at me. I gave him a blank stare back. \"What?\" I asked \"I was only asking if you enjoyed tucking into your sausage\" Carl shook his head, and looked away. I rolled my eyes, and left the table, feeling pissed off. What is everyone's problem ? Felicity gets annoyed cause I don't want sausages, Quentin thinks I've been sneaking out, and Carl gets pissed off cause I ask if he likes his food. I head down to the studio. It's not even midday, and I'm already annoyed. Harold was lining up tracks, so it's best not to disturb him. Angus is talking about some Doctor guy, (one of his 'jokes' I'm assuming), so I'm not going to interrupt. I saw Simon, reading about woodpeckers. I sighed, and headed off. Everyone's either working, pissed off, or boring. Great. What a crap day this is going to be. Meanwhile, in 10 Downing Street. The Prime Minister is a very busy man. He has things to deal with, such as taxes and...other things. He did not have time to sort out the rogues of the radio. The radio is a place for people such as Bach and Beethoven to be appreciated, not the trash those 'pirates' are playing. So when Sir Allistar volunteered to get rid of these vermin, the Prime Minister was more than happy to let him do so. Unfortunately, there was a snag. They weren't breaking any laws...That they knew of. But the Prime Minister knew Sir Allister was a man of his word, and when he promised to get rid of the poison of the radio, the Prime Minister knew he could count on him. Sir Allister was more than capable to shut them down, and he's never let the Prime Minister since he joined the Cabinet. But there's still time to make mistakes. Nobody's perfect. No matter what anybody says, they are not perfect. Except for Jesus. Oh, and Queen Elizabeth.[Chapter 3] Hey, what you guys think so far? :) R&R...You; know you want to ;) Disclaimer; I do not own any characters in the film and half of the plot. If I did, I'll be rich. I own Laurie, Steve and half of the plot. Sharesies :) ;) Enjoy! Chapter Three Truth or Dare \" Let's have a tune, I'm sick of this silence \" Dave's voice was soon replaced with Mick Jagger's. I was flicking some stupid book, when I heard a light knock on my door. Before I could even manage to say the word 'Enter', and when I peered over my book, I saw Gavin leaning on my door frame. I rolled my eyes, and went back to 'reading' my book. \"No matter how hard you try, it doesn't look like you're reading\" I threw the book on the floor as soon as Gavin said his smug comment. I rested my head on my arms, and looked at him. There was a short silence, before I sighed and asked, \"What do you want?\" \"I need a reason nowadays?\" Gavin asked, settling on my bed, which I immediately felt sink. I didn't answer his question, just looked at him. Gavin sighed and looked at the ground. \"You answered my question with a question, which is technically not even an answer\" I said, eventually. Gavin looked up, his dark eyes glistening. \"Shame\" was all he said. I rolled my eyes. I swear, I have better conversations with Mark than I do with anybody else on this boat. \"The reason I came in here,\" Gavin stated, whilst lighting a cigarette, causing my 'room' (if you can even call it that, because everyone always seems to wander in and out of it), to immediately stink of smoke. I blew it out of my face. Gavin, obviously not caring, carried on speaking, saying, \"Is because I wanted to see if you're okay\" I raised my eyebrow, and gave him a 'What's-The-Real-Reason?' look. Gavin just grinned. \"Come outside. Like I do every night\" I gave him a disgusted look, and shoved him off my bed. Knowing he'd react faster than the speed of light, I quickly jumped over his tangled up body and quickly exited the room. I shut the door behind me, giving me more of a chance. I laughed and screamed as I heard his 'angry' cries following me, down the stairs, and out on the deck. I hid behind The Count. Gavin and Count, for some reason, have always clashed. I think it's because they both think they're the best DJ on the radio, so a clash of egos was bound to happen. It's kind of funny to see them collide. Gavin's tall, skinny, and cleanly shaven, while the Count is the opposite of these things. Okay, he's not fat. But he's chubby. The Count, however, appeared to be on Gavin's side this time, as they both picked me up by the arms and legs, and started to swing me backwards and forwards. I screamed, and tried to kick Gavin or slap the Count, but resistance was futile. In the end, I gave up, and let what was about to happen, happen. \"1...2...3!\" They let go, and my body was sent hurtling towards the water. I saw the bubbles swarm around me, as I tried in vain to swim upwards, to get some air. I gasped, and spat out sea water, my throat burning. \"GAVIN! COUNT!\" I screamed as loud as I could. Gavin and the Count laughed, shaking hands. I scowled and climbed the ladder. I stormed up to them. I pointed at them both, and yelled, \" This is why I hate Americans. And this is why I hate purple trousers!\" Okay, that's a lie. I love Americans, and I love purple trousers. But I had to offend them somehow . They both gasped in shock before giving each other a high five. I felt a warm towel being wrapped around me, and I turned round to see Carl. I smiled and hugged him. \"Well well. Looks like you have competition Gavin\" Angus yelled. Everyone laughed, whereas me and Gavin scowled. \"At least she's interested in me\" Gavin called back. Angus stopped laughing, as did Simon. I glared at Gavin. \"I'm not interested in you. In any of you. You're all hideous. Except Felicity, she's gorgeous !\" Felicity blushed and said, \"Thank you, thank you\" I hugged her, and apologised for not eating her sausages. She just smiled, and went back to cooking on the barbie. I poured some water, and started to chat to people, other than Gavin and the Count. Everyone came, everyone left. They all had their own slots, but it was still easy to ignore the morons. As the day gradually grew into night, and as the warmth gradually became a chill, I soon realised that no one was still on deck. I wrapped my wet towel around me tighter, and headed inside. I ignored everyone there, not even bothering to give them a nod of acknowledgement. I went straight to the bathroom, where I took a well deserved, warm shower. I didn't take long, just enough time to feel clean . Which is difficult on a boat, but you get used to it. I wrapped the towel around my body, before sprinting to my room, praying I don't bump into anyone. Cause that would be, not only embarrassing, but also...bad. I quickly changed, before heading back downstairs, where everyone(The Count, he was broadcasting,and Harold obviously) was playing Truth or Dare. I opened a Coke and watched from behind the kitchen counter. Dave immediately spotted me, and beckoned me over. Figuring the man was also hungry, I poured a bowl of crisps out, and brought them over. Dave grinned. \"Have I ever told you, I love you?\" Dave asked cheekily. I shoved his head slightly, and took a seat between Carl and Simon, who seemed very happy I did. I poked my tongue out at Gavin, who just stuck his middle finger up. \"Okay, Mark it was your go last, so pick a name out of the hat\" Dave said, casting Mark's name aside for now. Mark silently picked one, a cigarette loosely hanging out of his mouth, his leather trousers as tight as ever, his torso pale as a ghost, even though he's been in the sun all day. Mark picked one out, and grinned at me. I smiled and took the last sip of my Coke. \"Okay, it's the Lovely Laurie\" Dave said, before stuffing his mouth with crisps. \"Indeed it is\" I replied, putting my empty bottle on the bit of floor behind me. Gavin smirked at me. I don't like it when he smirks. \"So. Truth or Dare?\" I lit up a cigarette, and replied, \"Surprise me\" Simon looked extremely happy when I said that. He's such a strange man. Lovely and sweet. But strange all the same. I just smiled and stole his hat. Carl chuckled, but the cheeky moment was ruined when Gavin said, \"I dare you to kiss Carl\" Carl and I stared at him, like he was mad. Mark, Dave, Simon, Angus and Felicity seemed to find the Dare hilarious. I shrugged, and planted a delicate kiss on Carl's lips. Gavin blew a raspberry, and said, \"That wasn't a kiss!\" I shrugged and blew some smoke his way. \"You wasn't very specific\" \"Fine. Make out with Carl\" \"Too late. My dare's done. It's my turn to pick out of the hat\" Feeling cheated out of show, Dave sulkily handed me the hat. I popped Mark's name back in, and swished the names around, and picked out Gavin's name. I raised a cheeky eyebrow, and smirked. \"Hmm, Mr Kavanagh...Truth or Dare?\" Gavin smiled. \"Surprise me\" I rolled my eyes. I was about to dare Gavin to pounce on the next person that walked into the room,when Dave interrupted my plans, asking Gavin, \"Would you rather shag the lovely Laurie, or the fabulous Felicity?\" I raised an eyebrow at Dave's language. I flopped my hand, said in a lisp, \" Fabulous da rrrr ling\" Dave hit my shoulder, pretty hard actually. I grumbled, and hit his back. As me and Dave started to hit each others arms repeatedly, I was just thankful that everyone was distracted, and was watching this tennis like punching match. Until, of course, Dave stopped punching mid-punch, and whispered so only I could hear, \"Nice try\" He turned back to Gavin. \"Well?\" Gavin thought long about the question. Which is rather ridiculous really. He had a full 15 minutes to do so. Still, I guess everyone in the room was just mesmerized by our punching skills. Of course they would. Why wouldn't they? I'm pretty good puncher. \"Gavin, you're up\" The Count walked in, taking a beer from the fridge, and sitting on the sofa. Gavin placed his sunglasses on, and nodded us all goodbye. I breathed a small sigh of relief. I punched Dave extra hard, so hard in fact, that half of his beer fell on the floor. \"Ow! What the bloody hell was that for?\" I glared at him. Dave just rolled his eyes, and when he went to go sip his beer, it was gone. I smiled, and drank the rest in once gulp. Angus stared at me, in amazement. Dave smirked. I knew what Dave's question was going to be, so I just stood up, and bid everyone goodnight. I was tired, and exhausted. Still, not like sleeping in my bunk was going to do any good. I swear, I have the smallest room. With no curtains. Even the shower has curtains. Which is probably wise, as it doesn't have a lock. I grumbled, and fell over, causing a loud crash, as I bashed my head against my bed. I groaned in pain, and when I looked up, I saw my Dad standing there, his face lighting up with amusement. One day, something's going to happen, that's going to seriously endanger my life... He won't be smiling then . I stood up, and ruffled my hair smoother. Quentin looked down, and said, \"I have some unfortunate news\" he stated. Hello to you Dad. \"Worse than me falling over?\" I asked, my head tilted to one side. \"Yes\" \"Wow, this must be bad\" Quentin smiled. But when he didn't carry on with our humorous conversation, I knew something was wrong. \"So, what is it?\" I asked. \"Steve's coming to visit\" Bugger. So...Yeah, Review and what not :)[Chapter 4] Hey, I would really like some reviews. I mean, some more reviews. It's a real confidence booster XD Cause I'm cool :) Nah, I'm not, but still...even it's one word :) Sorry it took so long btw. Disclaimer; You know, I don't any characters or half the plot, but I own Laurie and Steve and the other half Of the plot I mean. Enjoy! Chapter Four \"Wow Laurie, you look like fucking shit\" The Count laughed, as I stole his omelette. At least, it looked like an omelette. I grumbled, and stuffed the so-called omelette into my mouth. Today was the day that Steve visits. I tossed and turned all night yesterday, and it must show. I mean, I knew my eyes were bloodshot, with bags underneath them, and I knew my hair was like a birdnest, and I knew my face was pale. But there was no need to point it out. \"Wow Count, you look like your normal self. Shame\" Count smirked, before picking up a plate of food and leaving. I smiled and started to pick at the other food in front of me. Felicity slapped my hand, and I yelped in surprise. \"Stop being fussy. Now either eat, or go and get changed\" \"Yes mother !\" Felicity glared. You know she's annoyed when she does nothing but stare at you for ages. I slowly backed away. She smiled happily, and returned to kneading dough. I headed off towards my room, nervous and scared shitless. Last time Steve was here, was my 18th birthday. Needless to say, their was a clash of egos, and opinions, and it ended in disaster. I changed into a skirt, a random pair of socks, some shoes, and my white T-shirt. To be honest, I didn't really pay attention to what I was doing. Because as I looked out of my tiny window, I could see the boat from shore, arriving. I gulped, and took in a deep breath. My door opened, and I jumped out of skin, so badly, I hit the ceiling. I rubbed my head, as my Dad chuckled. I gave a sarcastic look, and asked sulkily, \"What?\" \"I presume you saw the boat arriving?\" I nodded. \"Why did you agree to this again?\" \"Because every father is allowed to see his daughter\" \"But, you're my Dad\" \" I know that. But he's entirely convinced that I'm not, and that I've brainwashed you. Might as well let him see you, he's done much worse\" I nodded, and rubbed the back of neck. I wanted nothing more than a hug. But Dad just stayed in the doorway, looking unbelievably cool and calm about this ordeal. He smiled, and shut the door. I sighed, and hugged an old teddy bear, Winston. I kissed Winston, and left. \"Ah, Steve!\" I stayed round the corner, and peered into the living area. All the DJ's (except Angus, he was broadcasting), were standing behind Quentin. Steve, was standing behind his luggage. Quentin didn't outstretch his arms for hug, just stood there, smoking. Steve narrowed his eyes. \"Where's my daughter\" Quentin shrugged. \" Your daughter would probably be on shore, who was conceived after a drunk night. My daughter on the other hand, is around that corner, watching us, like some civil war\" How does he always know? Steve walked up to Quentin, his nose basically touching his chin, and snarled, \"You are not civil\" \"I am too. You're the one trying to act all tough. I'm just standing here\" Steve glared, and turned round when he heard small footsteps. I stood in the doorway, my hands behind my back, and a fake smile forming on my face. Steve was looking much worse than he did two years ago. His hair was falling out, and his stomach was expanding. He was sweating. I detest sweaty people. \"Honey!\" Steve wrapped his chunky arms around me tightly, I couldn't breathe. My arms were trying to wrap around his waist, but it was impossible. In the end, I gave up, and let my arms hang by my sides. Everyone chuckled, and I gave the finger. \"C'mon Laurie, let's go take a walk\" I blinked, but before I could protest, Steve pushed me out of the room. I stumbled, but Steve just kept on pushing me. I looked back at him, and glared, which he didn't seem to notice. I eventually stumbled upon the dock, where the wind was harsh, and I could feel light drops of rain. I shivered. There was a lot of silence, except for the guitar sounds of Jimi Hendrix. I didn't know what to say. I could tell Steve had plenty to say. He just has a hard time trying to fit a sentence together. Eventually, he spoke, but it wasn't a nice sentence as I had hoped. But it's what I expected. \"What the fucking hell were you thinking staying here?\" I blinked. I honestly had no answer to that, but even if I did, he still wouldn't have let me speak. \"I could have given...a great fucking life. But you chose to stay here ? On...rusty, old piece of shit?\" I was still taken aback. \"What do they have, that I haven't got, hmm? I mean, I have a warm roof over your head. I have a house, not some stupid boat! Oh, and did I fail to mention it's a legal house?\" \"This boat is perfectly legal!\" \"This boat is a pirate boat, and as I remember correctly, throughout history, pirates have been illegal!\" \"Well, they've been giving a bad name! I reckon pirates were pretty cool...\" \"LOOK!\" Steve was shouting now, spit flying from his mouth, and his face was dangerously close to mine. I winced and took a step back in fear, which didn't go un-noticed by Steve, who hauled me back by my wrist, squeezing it tightly. \"I do NOT need your sass! You know I'm right, and you're coming home with me NOW! This boat is not safe, and is not healthy for you\" I wriggled out of his grip, and controlled my hand as it urged to slap him. \"Stop acting like a fucking drama queen! I chose to stay here, and...and that's that! It's my choice, it's my life, and you can't control it any more!\" Steve's facial expression was lingering on shock, and anger. Unfortunately, he chose anger. Steve grabbed my wrist once more, and pulled me closer to him. His podgy fingers tightened around my wirst, even tighter than a few minutes ago and I struggled to free his grip this time. I kicked him in the shin, and ran away from his threats, as fast as I could. I ran inside, holding the door shut. I turned round and saw Quentin standing there, in a soldier like stance, his head cocked to one side. I smiled, and said, \"Hey\" The door opened, so suddenly, it sent me flying across the floor. I felt my elbows graze, as I landed to halt. Quentin picked me up, and wrapped his arms around me, almost as if he was protecting me. This is the closest I've got to a hug. I didn't realise how cold I was, until I felt a warm hand slip into mine. I looked at Carl, who gave me a gentile squeeze, as Steve came running towards us. He was once again, nose-to-chin with Quentin, who was trying hide his anger from his face. Steve snarled, \"This is not over!\" He stormed out. I felt tears in my eyes. There was a long, painful silence. If someone didn't speak, I just knew that I would scream. Or sob. I really wasn't quite sure yet. I looked up at Quentin, who looked down at me. He squeezed my shoulders,but it wasn't him who spoke. \"Always nice to have a visit\" Everyone groaned, and rolled their eyes. \"Wow, could you be more fucking insensitive Gavin?\" asked the Count. \"One-Aren't you supposed to be broadcasting? Two-It made her laugh. So..Nurgh!\" \"One-No. Two-No it didn't\" \"It made her laugh on the inside \" \"Oh, shut up the pair of you\" Quentin said clearly annoyed. Gavin and Count continued to argue as the 'gang of pirates' dispersed around me,leaving me and Carl alone. Carl smiled, almost shyly, and walked away, slowly, as if he was waiting for me to say something. I just tapped his shoulder, and followed the others, their bickering getting louder and louder. Angus had joined in, trying to say something funny, but immediately failed, as everyone shouted simultaneously, \"SHUT UP!\" I smiled to myself. How could Steve want me to leave? This is the greatest place on earth. 10 Downing Street The Prime Minister was getting frustrated. Sir Alistair has still not found a solution to this pirate radio problem, and it was beginning to give him a headache. Shut down by the end of the year, his arse. At this rate, they will never be shut down. The Prime Minister's assistant, Polly, walked in, holding some more sheets of paper. The Prime Minister was sick of paper. It's even worse than his wife. \"Oh, Prime Minister?\" Polly asked, just as she was exiting the room. The Prime Minister sighed. Whenever Polly spoke, it was because she was either going to tell him that there was some bad news, or that his wife called. Which, in itself, is bad news. \"What?\" He asked, irritably. Polly swallowed whatever was in her mouth, probably leftovers from a one-night stand, and said, \"Sir Alistair Dormandy called. Said, he's bringing in a twat to help him with the job, sir\" The Prime Minister was puzzled. He frowned and said, \"He's bringing in Twatt?\" \"That's what I said, sir\" Prime Minister dismissed her with a simple wave of his hand. \"What an incompetent young lady\" he muttered, under his breath, as he shifted threw the pages of paper, mostly blank ones. The sight of paper almost made him physically ill, but he still managed to breathe. \"With a magnificent rack\" The Prime Minister smiled to himself, and until he went home to his wife, that smile never left his face.[Chapter 5] Hey :) Sorry it took so long. I'm reviewing for a website now, I've got other stories, and tonnes of schoolwork, and I have tonnes to do over the hols. I lovey you? (A) OKAY you know about the disclaimer, if not, read the last chapter. :) Chapter Fiiiive Chapter Five The Noose and The Nightmares A Political Office In London Twatt walked beside Miss C, his work in his hands. The week was up, and he had to find a loophole, after the failure that was the 'juggernaut'. Somehow even Radio Rock managed to squeeze past the ban on Britain advertising, by appealing to America. He knew that would've happened anyway, because of the sleaze known as Gavin Kavanagh. Twatt never really liked Gavin anyway... Miss C pushed the door open, and Sir Alistair looked up from his desk briefly, before looking back down at the obvious blank sheets of paper. Twatt hated this man. All he did was yell, and when something good happened, apparently it was all Sir Alistair's idea and Twatt had nothing to do with it. ' Leech ' Twatt immediately thought in his mind as he walked towards him. \"Well sir, it's the end of the week, and I'm afraid, that I haven't found you a loop-hole\" Twatt said cunningly, a fake frown appearing on his face, whereas inside, he was dying to burst out and tell him what he's find and how he's going to get all the credit for this one. \"Ah. Pity. Well, back to the bottom you go, just like your pathetic little father I suppose-\" Sir Alistair began, but Twatt quickly interrupted, before he could insult more of his fathers honour, \"But what I have found you is a noose\" Twatt sat down smugly, as he threw the file onto Sir Alistair's desk. He picked it up, his glasses tipped on the end of his nose, frustration apparent in his features. \"Last week a boat of fishermen were trying to send a signal for help but it couldn't be reached. Men were dying but the signal was blocked because of this rock n roll... pornography \" Twatt said, decidedly pleased with himself. \"Excellent, excellent. Did the fishermen die in the end?\" \"No\" \"Oh...That's a pity...\" There was an awkward silence, as Twatt stared at Sir Alistair, wondering if the old man knew how shamefully mean he sounded then. Twatt quickly snapped back into reality, not caring anymore, and said, \"I think I've found a way to get on board the ship to do some intimate research\" \"Good good. Oh, you may leave now\" As Twatt proudly stood up, as if he had been knighted, Sir Alistair announced, \"We have their testicles in our hands! And it feels good!\" Twatt blinked, before walking away, muttering so low under his breath, even he couldn't hear what he said, \"And you would know first hand, wouldn't you?\" Twatt headed out of the office, and home, to start preparing for what surely would be the most sickening day of his life . But everyone has to make sacrifices once in a while... Meanwhile, In The Middle Of The Ocean \"Hey, wake the fuck up you lazy bastard\" My peaceful snoring was interrupted by a brutal kick of my bed, by the lovely Count. I groaned, and turned round, burying myself further into my duvet, trying to ignore the repeated kicks that Count was forcing me to go through before yelling hoarsely at the chubby American, \"Alright you fucking idiot, I'm up!\" I rubbed my eyes, as the Count chuckled. \"Ooh, someone's grumpy!\" He mocked. I groaned and replied, \"Sorry. Nightmares are coming back\" \"Aw, fuck again ? I hate it when you have nightmares, you start to fucking sleepwalk everywhere!\" he yelled, as he lit a cigarette. I coughed and blew the smoke out of my face. Normally, the smell of smoke, and a warm cup of coffee would perk me up. But today, the smell of smoke made me cough, and the thought of coffee made me queasy. \"Come on, get up, the competition winners are coming today\" Count kicked my bed one more time, before leaving. I groaned and rubbed my hand over my sweaty face. For some reason, every day I'm becoming more and more ill. And the only solution to that is that I have food poisoning. Which of course is the plausible and logical out all of the other ideas. I threw on a random pair of trousers, a white blouse, and a pair of green socks. I quickly brushed threw my hair, and pulled it into a messy ponytail, my pale flesh more visible. I trudged downstairs, and the smell of sausages lingered underneath my nostrils. I swallowed the vomit that was rising up my throat, and walked in like everything was fine. Everyone greeted me with a faint hello, before returning to their breakfast. I grabbed the milk and smelt it. Thankfully, it was useful. I don't think I'd be able to take another batch of sausages for breakfast. I blocked out the sound of laughter, and the sound of Angus' voice over the speakers. I was too tired and ill to pay attention. However, somehow, Carl's voice managed to unblock everything, even though he only quietly spoke, \"Hey, you feeling okay?\" I turned to him, my black hair almost hitting me in the face. I nodded and carried on eating normally. I saw out of the corner of my eye that Carl was ready to speak once more, and I was grateful when my Dad interrupted his train of thought, \"Okay everyone! Listen up! The winners are on their way, so please be on your best behaviour! I am begging you!\" \"Don't you worry Quentin, we will, we will...Our best in bed anyway!\" Dave said, as a chorus of cheers and laughter quickly overpowing Dave's voice. Some, like Simon, had no idea what he was talking about, but still cheered. Quentin rolled his small blue eyes, and said sternly, \" Anyway. We need to get these people on our side! Otherwise the government will win !\" Everyone groaned, whilst I still didn't speak. Quentin's favourite topic this week has been the government, and their plans to shut us down. Everyone on the ship is sick of it, apart from me. I just think it shows how much he cares about this ship. Of course, he doesn't want to seem like a wuss, so he acts like a badass. \"Oh, and any suspicious characters, throw them overboard!\" Quentin said as he left the room. \"How can there be suspicious characters? What are we supposed to look out for, a guy in a puffer jacket and a bobble hat?\" Gavin laughed. \"Or a long brown trench coat, with a big hat over his eyes\" Dave laughed \"Or a guy with a-\" Angus began, but Dave quickly said, \"No you just killed it\" I chuckled and walked out onto the deck, leaving everyone to bicker amongst themselves. I found Thick Kevin out their, looking out on the sea. \"You alright Kev?\" I asked, as I strolled over to him, my hands in my pockets. Kevin nodded and replied, \"You know fish?\" \"Yeah?\" \"If they could fly...would they be birds?\" I stared at him blankly. \"Because,\" he continued, before I could even answer, which was a good thing I suppose, \"then that means that they would scaly birds. So they wouldn't actually be birds...but they would fly. So...what would they be?\" \"Well, you get flying fish...\" I mumbled. Kevin's eyes widened in amazement. \" Really ?\" he asked shocked. I laughed and leaned on the balcony, as I saw a small dot on the horizon, come closer towards us. I sighed and looked down. I had a sinking feeling in my gut that something was going to go horribly wrong. Or maybe...just once...something would go terribly... right . Okay, okay, I know! It's a rather sucky chapter. But to be honest, I've had writers block for a while, and I had to do something...I know that makes it sound worse, but it's 1:11 am, and I have decided to not really care atm :) But I care about you guys? Okay, so R&R.; Don't tell me it's awful, cause I already know that... I promise the next one will be twice as long, and much much better. I swears :) x x[Chapter 6] So...I'm back! I'm sorry I abandoned this story! But, enjoy nonetheless! Spoilers; a possible love interest for Laurie springs up :) Ooh, yay and stuff! Review (even though I don't deserve it), Criticise (this I do deserve), whatever you must do to get me to write faster! This part one of Chapter Six. There will either be two parts, or three, I haven't decided yet. We shall wait and see! I love you guys for being so patient! xxx Chapter Six, part one, An Adventure The contest winners mainly consisted of girls. They were all screaming, more noticeably, screaming Gavin's name. He was clearly lapping it up, twirling for them, and thrusting the air, his ego becoming more boosted as the screams grew louder. I rolled my eyes, and rested my head on the metal rail. Carl was beside me, and he did the same. I chuckled. \"Are you not joining in the festivities?\" I asked, my voice thick with sarcasm. Carl chuckled. \"Nope. Well...maybe...\" I grinned, and scanned the crowd once more. I sighed. There wasn't many people that were even looking in my direction, let alone someone to talk to. It wasn't often I would see people from 'land'. I rarely go on there, only on occasion (just to double check I can still walk on there), and it's not like we have a competition for people to come on the boat every week. I watched as the fans excitedly followed the guys inside, all them screeching and buzzing about the fact they were in the presence of their 'idols'. I looked at Carl. \"You sure you're not going to join in?\" I asked. Carl also watched the fans follow everyone. He could tell there was more girls than guys. Pretty girls, no doubt. I smiled as he unknowingly licked his lips. \"You don't mind?\" he asked. Before I could even say 'Yes', Carl bounded down the stairs, three at a time, and followed them in. I smiled to myself, and also headed down the steps, one at a time though. If I stay outside, then I suppose I won't have to endure all the chaos that was happening inside. On the other hand, it is fucking freezing out here. I went inside, where it was warm but immensely loud. I rolled my eyes at the girls excited by a blender, and tried to make my way through the thick crowd. \"Excuse me, sorry, can I just- Oh my god!\" I yelled as a boy spilt his drink down his jumper. I dabbed the liquid with my hand, making it only seep through the jumper thicker and quicker. I covered my mouth in horror. \"I am so sorry!\" I apologised. The boy chuckled. \"No, it's fine honestly. This jumper's hideous anyway. My mum gave it to me...she thinks I'm out playing football with the lads,\" the boy explained, with an amused smile on his face. I smiled. \"You play football in jumpers?\" I asked, biting back a little giggle. From the corner of my eye, I could see Gavin and Dave looking in my direction, talking in low whispers to one another. I slowly turned and smiled a tiny smile, before turning back to the boy. \"I don't play football period. But my mum hates pirate radio, and would probably have a stroke if she found out I listened to it everyday,\" the boy said, a mischievous glint in his blue, or possibly grey, eyes. I smiled. \"Well..I'm sorry again,\" I apologised once more. \"It's fine...\" he trailed off, as he took off his jumper. \"Laurie,\" I introduced, \"and you are?\" \"Tyler.\" \"Nice to meet you Tyler,\" I said, shaking his hand. He shook it back, and smiled at me. There was a small silence between us, and I licked my dry lips. \"Alright everyone, let's move on!\" called Dave, right into my ear, breaking the silence (whilst damaging my eardrum in the process). Tyler smiled and followed everyone else into the kitchen, who all seemed excited to see tins of soup and beans. I was about to follow, when I felt myself being pulled back, gently. \"What are you playing at?\" hissed Gavin. \"I was just merely talking,\" I explained. \"Listen...if anything happened to you, it would be our heads on the chopping block. Personally, I think it's great that you've met someone... interesting , but just...be careful, okay?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Gavin, I can handle myself. It's not like I warn you against your women.\" \"No, but you do remind me to use protection.\" \"Which is a good thing. Now if you'll excuse me...I have a tour to endure.\" I said, with a firm nod. Gavin raised a bemused eyebrow, but let me go on into the kitchen regardless. I pushed past all of the reluctant girls, and stood next to Tyler. He was much taller than me, so he was practically looming over me. I smiled up at him, and faced forward, listening to Dave rabbit on about how Felicity cooks. The rest of the tour was long and dull. I noticed most of the girls had disappeared halfway through, leaving all but a few left, including myself and Tyler. \"Welcome back. I hope you all had a tremendous time,\" Quentin said. The few of them that were left cheered and clapped. I just grinned at Tyler. \"Only, slightly odd thing, there only seems to be half of many of you that were here earlier...if you give us a moment, we'll sort out this strange and mysterious situation.\"As Quentin and the others went on the hunt for the rest of the winners (no guesses where they would be...Mark, anyone?), Tyler and I started to talk about our childhood. \"My dad works most of the time. He's big in London, or so he says. My mum's convinced he's having an affair, but still refuses to leave him. Says he looks after us. But he doesn't. He's either working or drunk. That's not much of a father, is it?\" he asked me. Try having mine , I thought, almost tempted to say it. Instead, I shook my head. \"No, it's not..\" I whispered. \"What about you?\" Tyler asked me. I shrugged. \"My mum died a while ago,\" I began, but I saw Tyler's sympathetic look in his eyes. I rolled my eyes. \"Don't,\" I warned him. Tyler laughed. \"Don't what?\" \"Look at me like that! I know, it's sad, and I miss her everyday. Thing is...it was a while ago, so I'm over it. Well, not over it, over it, but you get what I mean right?\" I asked him. Tyler nodded his head eagerly, paused and then shook his head. \"No. You've lost me,\" he said, laughing a little. I chuckled and bit my lip, trying to conjure up the proper words to explain it without, without offending my mum. \"Well, it's like.. I'm over the fact that she's dead. It's not like I'm crying everyday, as I used to. But it's not like I've totally forgotten about her, get it?\" I asked, once more. Tyler nodded. I saw all of the girls that had previously disappeared, trudge onto the boat deck, pulling their tops over their heads. I chuckled and turned back to Tyler. He opened his mouth, but my dad's voice bellowed instead, \"My dearest comrades. It has been wonderful to have you all here, but unfortunately, it is time to move on..\" The crowd moaned and whined together in unison. \"We hope to see you all very soon. Goodbye!\" Quentin said, waving to them as they all piled onto the boat that gets them to shore. I felt Tyler grab my hand. \"Come on!\" he said, as we headed to the back of the crowd. Of course. I forgot to tell him that I live on the boat. He thinks that I live on shore, along with the rest of normal society. I looked up at the others, who were all still waving goodbye on the top deck. I swallowed, and kept my head down, hoping that no one would notice I was leaving. I stepped onto the boat, and Tyler quickly followed. He kept his hand on my waist as the boat headed off for shore. Along with the rest of them, I turned and faced the boat, and waved, until the boat became a tiny dot on the horizon. Tyler lit up a cigarette and offered me one. I practically snapped it out of his hands. I felt a bit sick. I knew my dad and the others would freak once they realised I was gone. If they ever realise I'm gone... I thought. They probably won't. There's broadcasting, and...alcohol to worry about first. I breathed the smoke out, and turned to Tyler and asked, \"What are you doing now?\" Tyler smiled. \"Just going into town,\" he replied, \"want to come with?\" I nodded. I needed to get the idea that the other's would be worried about me out of my head. We arrived on shore and Tyler and I leapt off the boat. I looked at the captain, and said to Tyler, \"I'll be really quick.\" I jogged over to him. He frowned at me. \"Laurie..what are you doing off the boat? Your dad didn't-\" \"My dad doesn't know I'm here,\" I interrupted. The captain raised his eyebrows. \"Ohh dear..\" he muttered. \"Please don't make me go back yet! Just a few hours...please!\" I begged, clutching my hands together. The captain gave me a stern look, before softening it and nodding. \"Of course. I'll see you in a few hours,\" he replied, before wandering off, muttering to himself. I turned and skipped back to Tyler. \"What was that about?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"Nothing...come on!\" For the next few hours, we went into record shops, flicking through the albums, and hiding some beneath our clothing. We went into clothes shops and mocked the mannequins, posing in the shop windows with ridiculous outfits, before being chased out by the shop managers. We bothered the public, drank a bottle of whiskey Tyler stole from the ship, and just had a general good time. I didn't even notice the time, until I checked my watch. \"Shit,\" I muttered. Tyler looked at me, confused. \"What?\" he asked. \"I have to get back...home,\" I said, grabbing all of my things, including my new records. I took one last swig of whiskey, and made my way back to the dock. \"Hold on!\" called Tyler, \"I'll walk you home!\" I paused, and bit my lip. Should I stop? No. I carried on walking. Tyler eventually caught up with me. I looked at him in surprise, but said nothing. \"Where do you live?\" Tyler eventually asked. I carried on walking, sighing a little. Time for the truth. \"On Radio Rock..\" I mumbled. Tyler looked at me in amazement. \"What?\" \"My dad..my actual blood-related dad, basically runs the show. I sneaked off with you, because...well, it's boring there. I don't really get to do anything, just wander around and talk to the same people over and over. And then, you showed up, along with the rest of the competition winners, and you were fun and different. So, I thought, what's the harm, and now my dad's going to kill me..\" I rambled, as I walked faster. We arrived at the dock, and the boat was ready and waiting. I turned to Tyler. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you from the start,\" I said, softly. Tyler smiled. \"It's okay. I can see why you didn't..\" I looked up into blue-grey eyes, and ran my hand through his dark brown hair. \"Bye Laurie,\" he said. \"Bye Tyler,\" I said, with a sad smile. Tyler grinned and kissed me softly. I wrapped my arms around his neck, and kissed back. \"A little something to remember me by.\" I laughed and headed on to the boat. As we headed back to the ship, I waved at Tyler, until he was nothing more than a tiny little dot on the horizon. ","Summary":" Chapter One-A New Life. Story-Past-3 years before \" Wow. And now \" I chuckled softly at the sound"},{"Movie":"Rock and Rule","Title":"Resurrection","Author":"XxAnarchyStockingFangirlxX","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8949818","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/n: I realize I should be working on updating my Harry Potter stories, but ugh! This idea came to me and I REALLY wanted to get it out there. I am a major Rock & Rule fan (such an underrated masterpiece, really) and I just felt the need to write something for the movie! Slight warning: Omar MAY come off even more of a bastard than he is in the movie. I DO love Omar, but I like seeing him as a prick as well. So be forewarned, Omar fans! Disclaimer: *sigh* I don't own Rock & Rule, sadly. Nelvana owns R&R.; But since they're so disappointed in the film and ignore its existance, can I have it? :D Prologue All eyes on them. Fame, fortune, their names in lights, VIP parties, sold out concerts...everything was fabulous for the Drats. After several years and failed talent shows, the Drats FINALLY made it to the big shot. They were finally famous and things were going glamorous for them. Right after Mok's Beauty and the Beast concert, the masses finally got a chance to see the great energy and potential of this band. People all over the world became infatuated with them and their music. All was going well for the band...until a couple of months after they defeated Mok. Angel, the beauty of the group, had begun showing troubling symptoms. Of course for a while after the concert, maybe a week or so, she would often wake up in the middle of the night, screaming, petrified that her nightmares were true and that Mok really did come back. Many a night did Omar have to comfort his girlfriend, reminding her that that mad wrinkled cat man was gone. Gone gone gone. Into another dimension, where that demon he was so obsessed with probably devoured him. Angel would nod, still trembling and obviously terrified. Then as one week turned into several, Angel kept having the nightmares even more so. She was too tired for rehearsals to even pick up the microphone and sing with Omar. She became jumpy. She basically became a shell of her former careless self after that damned Mok used her for his evil purposes. It shouldn't be surprising she was still terrified, but really, she was probably taking it overboard. Then during one practice, Angel stopped right in the middle of singing their newest song, and rushed outside, throwing up. Her band mates followed her with concern, scared for their friend. Was she really sick? Maybe it was from that pizza they had the night before. Or was she so scared by Mok that she was making herself sick just thinking about it? Nonsense, this was Angel. She would rise above it! ...they hoped. When her vomiting and every-so-often change of mood didn't cease, Dizzy decided to set up an appointment with the local Ohmtown doctor to have her checked out. As the group drove to the hospital, Omar kept giving worried glances to his girlfriend. Angel tried to smile, obviously forcing one to appear. Dizzy was obviously worried too. He loved Angel, probably more than Omar, but he never voiced his feelings; he didn't want to betray Omar. Besides, he had no shot in Hell. Stretch finally parked the car and he and Dizzy waited in it while Omar led Angel inside, checking in and waiting patiently. After what seemed like decades, the doctor finally called Angel in. Omar followed closely behind, not wanting to leave her side and wanting to know just what exactly was wrong with his girlfriend. Angel had told the doctor all about her symptoms (and her nightmares in case it would give any more insight), and she had some tests done on her. Now she and Omar were alone in the room, waiting for the doctor to come back in with results of the tests. She was scared and held Omar's hand the entire time. \"Omar, what if it's something bad?\" Angel asked, fear evident in her gorgeous blue eyes as she looked to him for comfort. Omar's mouth thinned into a line, obviously worried as well. He tried being optimistic. \"You'll be fine, Angel. Maybe you just have the flu or something. I'm positive.\" Angel only offered him a weak smile in reply. After about forty five minutes, the doctor returned, looking over several papers on the clipboard. After several long minutes of silence, the doctor looked up at the two teens and sighed, looking at Angel. \"Miss Angel, the tests we recieved indicate you don't have any cancer or toxins in your body whatsoever...\"-Angel and Omar breathed a sigh of relief, smiling at each other-\"...but the tests did find something. Angel, I must inform you that you are about over a month pregnant.\" That last sentance left the room so eerily quiet, you could hear a pin drop. No, more like a speck of dust. Angel's eyes were widened and her grip on Omar's hand tightened. \"You...you can't be serious...\" she muttered in disbelief, looking quickly between Omar and the doctor. At first, Omar was stunned as well, then his surprise was turned into evident anger. \"I see,\" he said quietly, releasing his hand from Angel's grasp. \"Well, thank you doctor. We'll be on our way now.\" And so they left. The car ride back was awkward, some tension was evident between Angel and Omar. Dizzy questioned them about it, but recieved nothing but a cold shoulder. When they returned back to Mylar's backstage, Omar pulled Angel aside as Dizzy and Stretch were getting their instruments ready for another rehearsal. Omar was glowering at Angel, making her shrink back slightly. \"So, you were sleeping around behind my back, were you?\" he asked, his voice raising with every word. Angel glared back with equal ice. She stood her ground. \"Omar, I would never do such a thing! You know I love you, and I'd never ever sleep with other men behind your back!\" she shot back. Omar crossed his arms stubbornly and leered, making himself seem taller than he already was. \"You didn't? Then how the fuck did you get pregnant? It obviously can't be mine! That night we shagged at Thunder Row, I put on a condom, and when we finished, the thing did not break! So don't say it was a faulty condom, since it was obviously sturdy and that was the only time we've had sex!\" Omar scoffed accusingly. \"So obviously, you've slept around! You do have a huge male fanbase, you realize!\" \"I do realize that, Omar, but I would never betray you!\" \"Oh, then I suppose God chose you to be mother to a new baby Jesus or something? Please, Angel, how else can you explain the fact that you're knocked up?\" Omar yelled. Angel bit her lip. She had kept it a secret for a while now and she didn't want to remember it, but the truth just spilled out of her mouth. \"I was raped, Omar!\" Omar looked stunned for a split second, but then he rolled his eyes. \"I doubt that, Angel! Raped by who?\" \" Mok. \" She clenched her fists tightly, seething. Omar was silent for a while then tugged at his jacket. \"And you expect me to believe that Mok raped you?\" he asked, obviously not buying it. \"Oh please, Angel! You remember way back before he kidnapped you? You were absolutely smitten with him! I saw your shrine to that freak! You were absolutely in love with him!\" He ran a hand through his orange hair in frustration. \"You were always jealous of reading or hearing about the girls he brought to bed that weren't you. I bet when Mok first got his hands on you, you were willing to open your legs for him!\" Angel's eyes became shiny, obviously tears were about to pour over. She turned her back on Omar. Little did they know that Dizzy and Stretch heard the declaration of Angel's pregnancy causes, but they didn't come out and say anything, still listening. Angel stomped on the ground with one foot then turned back around to face Omar, face enraged and sad, tears rolling down her beautiful cheeks. \"Whether you believe me or not, Omar, it's the truth. Mok indeed did rape me. And for your information, I was not 'in love' with him. It was a rock star crush. Once I learned of his true colours before he made me unconscious and kidnapped me that night, I loathed him immediately. I would never have slept with him willingly!\" she shot back. Omar scoffed again and shook his head. \"Well obviously you liked it since you didn't stop him.\" \"Don't you think I would have stopped him if I could!?\" It was quiet for a few minutes until Omar finally spoke up. \"Well why don't you have an abortion?\" Omar asked, no emotion whatsoever. Angel glared even more at her jerk of a boyfriend. \"You know that goes against my beliefs!\" Angel yelled. \"Well? Would you rather have some... thing that turns out as evil as that freak? Or maybe it has some freakish deformity. Hell, why would you keep a thing if it is the product of rape and be reminded of the father every fucking day?\" Omar hissed. \"Just because I was raped, that doesn't mean the baby should die because of it!\" \"Unbelievable.\" Omar laughed bitterly, shaking his head. \"Omar, if this is how you're going to act, then we are through!\" Angel yelled as Omar turned around to walk back inside. Omar froze in his tracks and turned his head to glare at Angel. Sneering, he said nothing, and pushed his way back inside of Mylar's club and back to the stage, completely ignoring the disbelief on Dizzy's and Stretch's faces at Omar's attitude. Angel stayed outside in the moonlight for a little while longer before slowly coming inside. Dizzy hugged her and Angel tried to look strong in front of him and Stretch. \"Come on, let's go back to practicing,\" she muttered, going to her piano. That night, Angel laid in bed, angry with herself and especially with Omar. How dare he act so stubborn! She should have known he was still the jackass from before they hooked up and he saved her at Mok's concert. After he saved her, he seemed gentle and nicer, but apparently his jackassery was still there, just waiting for the perfect time to surface. Of course he'd never change. And how she loathed Mok. She was indeed in love with him at first, but after he was so greedy and demanding with making Angel betray her whole group, she began to despise him. Since he kidnapped her, the whole trip, he had been showing not-so-subtle sexual interst in the young girl. Angel just shrugged it off, just thinking (and hoping) it was just his way of flattering her so she would sing for him. Then of course, that night they were to go perform back in Ohmtown...Mok had reached his limit. Angel had tried to distract him by pretending to love him and finding him irresistable, yelled at him and called him off for what he really was-a fake-and she was very strong about not wanting to sing for him. He had choked her. Of course, he didn't kill her. If he did that, then he'd never get what he was after. So he let her go and threw her down to the ground, storming off to have his childish yelling rampage in his wig closet. Angel had stayed in the room Mok was just in, her mind reeling. Then when Zip drugged Angel, following Mok's orders, Angel could only recall faint bits and pieces of what happened after being drugged, but she definitely remembered what pieces that did come to mind. She was strapped in the circular bed where Mok was earlier when she tried distracting him, not being able to get free. Lost memory. Then, she heard her name being called out in his slithery voice, chilling her spine. Her sight was slightly blurry, but there was no mistaking it was indeed Mok, still in his loose robe, coming towards her with a sick smile on his ugly face. Blacked out again. She awoke to the feeling of her clothes being torn apart and she felt so...disgusted being exposed to his sleazy eyes and his long fingers, caressing every curve and contour of her body. Then he violated her. There was no mistaking in that. He raped her into submission to sing, then he triumphantly smirked and then Angel blacked out again. There was no mistaking he finished violating her while she was unconscious again. And now she began crying into her pillow. Being forced to have Mok's child unnerved her to the core. Curse her morals. And Omar was obviously apathetic about the whole situation. Angel hated being where she was right now. But now that she knew she was pregnant, her nightmares about that night among nightmares of Mok coming back for her became more frequent. Maybe it was all just a bad dream, Angel told herself. Maybe she would wake up any moment now and things would be back to the way they were before they ever ran into Mok. Trying to cheer herself up (but not very successfully), Angel turned to her side and fell asleep, a black and dreamless sleep. A/n: So how'd you like it? I'll be adding a few chapters, but it won't be a super long story. Now, I know Omar came off as a huge jerk, but I do believe he would react in a similar way. He may have been caring for Angel in the movie at times, but he was mostly arrogant throughout, so I don't think he'd get rid of his jerkitude. Just my opinion. But I don't hate Omar. Oh no, I do love him. I love caring Omar and I love bastard Omar. *Shrug* In my head canon, I'd think Mok probably did rape Angel some time during the movie, but it wasn't shown or mentioned. I wouldn't put it past him. I mean, we don't really know EVERYTHING he did to Angel, so who's to say he didn't rape her? And sorry for using \"finally\" and \"indeed\" a million times :P Next chapter coming soon.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: *sigh* I don't own Rock & Rule, sadly. Nelvana owns R&R.; But since they're so disappointed in the film and ignore its existance, can I have it? :D And I don't own the lyrics of the song. It belongs to Joan Jett. 16-year-old Janet Swagger sat on top of the amp in her room, tuning her guitar to find the right sound to come out of it. In a few hours, she was going to make her debut as a singer like her mother, Angel. She brushed a blonde lock of hair out of her face and kept twisting the knobs at the end of the guitar to tune it. The young soon-to-be-rocker had been all over the media growing up. Rumours were always spread, such headlines as \"Angel's no Angel?\" and even \"Careless Rockstar Mother Takes Child Away from Father.\" None of those headlines were true and Janet hated every lie the magazines spit out. But of course once they found out who her real father was, the conspiracies would never stop coming. She never knew her father. Of course, she knew his name, but Angel told her bad things about him and about how he was an obsessed Satanic psycho. But that was basically all Janet ever heard about her father, the infamous Mok Swagger. Janet had been born with her father's cat genes. Thankfully she had some modifications with her genetics, and it was a good thing she didn't look as strange and slightly hideous as her father. Her eyes and hair colour closely resembled Angel's. Her hair was cut short and she always wore leather clothes. She was a stubborn girl, that was for sure. Angel came into her daughter's room and smiled at her when it was time. \"Hey Jan. Ready to make yourself known to the rock world?\" she asked. Nodding curtly and standing up, Janet put the guitar strap around her and held her guitar delicately. \"Yes'm. They're not ready for Janet Swagger,\" she said, smiling greatly. She heard Mylar dismiss the last group after they finished, and he then introduced Janet, so she figured that was her cue. She grabbed her guitar and walked on stage, strumming her guitar when the curtain lifted. Angel had to remind herself to thank Dizzy and Stretch for being Janet's back-up instrumentalists. Janet grabbed the microphone and started singing. \"I think of you every night and day You took my heart and you took my pride away...I hate myself for loving you, Can't break free from the things that you do, I wanna walk but I run back to you that's why I hate myself for loving you!\" Angel watched her daughter proudly from backstage. And she was good if Mylar didn't cut the curtain by now. As her daughter finished singing, she bowed and she, Dizzy, and Stretch got off stage. Janet hugged Angel. \"Mom that was the best feeling ever!\" she exclaimed. Angel chuckled and patted her daughter's hair. \"And we had a full house too!\" Stretch exclaimed, giggling. \"What say we all get ice cream?\" Dizzy suggested. Everyone agreed and they headed out, but Angel caught sight of an upcoming concert poster with a huge M in the center, right under the letter were the big red lips of...No. It couldn't be him! He had to have been still in the other dimension! There was no way he could be back! Angel felt a very bad feeling in the pit of her gut, but she just shook her head, trying to rationalize the poster. Maybe it was from years ago and it wasn't put down. But then again, it looked fairly recent... \"Angel! You coming?\" Stretch called from the car. Angel snapped out of her reverie and looked over to them. \"Oh. Yeah! Sorry, I was just side tracked. I thought I saw...a dog eat a pigeon.\" The blonde rocker quickly went over to her group and daughter and got into the back seat next to Janet, who was fiddling with her bracelet. Stretch stepped on the gas and began leading the way towards the ice cream parlor. After having some delicious ice cream, the group left the parlor and decided to go for a walk. It was a quiet evening in Ohmtown. Angel had pushed what she saw earlier to the back of her mind. Maybe she was just hallucinating. Janet was playing some game on her video game console, its 8-bit music blaring in poor quality. Stretch watched Janet play with interest. He hadn't outgrown his love for video games. All was fine until the group walked past a giant telescreen in town, many Ohmtown residents had their eyes trained on it in interest, and some with fear. \"What's going on?\" Dizzy asked some mouse girl. She turned to look at him, eyes wide in an unreadable expression. \"It's Mok! He's come back for another tour!\" she said excitedly, pointing to the screen. Dizzy blinked, unbelieving, then he and the group (minus Janet) looked at the telescreen. They were all shocked. \"But...but we defeated him sixteen years ago! How is he back?!\" Dizzy demanded to no one in particular. \"Oh no, he'll probably come find us and heck us!\" Stretch said, shaking on the spot. Janet rolled her eyes. \"Stretch. It's not a heck. It's a hex. How many times do we have to tell you?\" she asked, annoyed, eyes not leaving the game. Angel was too shocked and frightened. But of course she said nothing, her eyes narrowing in anger. Her fists clenched and unclenched tightly. \"Yessiree!\" said the announcer on the telescreen, \"Mok the Magic Man has returned from a long hiatus for his revival concert, Demon in the Black at the Ohmtown power plant in two weeks! Tickets go on sale now!\" Then an image of Mok's evil face flashed on the screen, a smirk playing on his lips. Angel felt like he was mocking her. She screamed and shattered the telescreen. \"He can't be back!\" she shouted, still in denial. Dizzy came over to Angel. \"We're just as stumped as you are. But we just have to defeat him again somehow,\" he reassured Angel. \"M-maybe he's seen the error of his was and came back good?\" Stretch suggested, his voice shaking. \"Get serious,\" Dizzy said flatly to Stretch. Janet looked up. \"What's the big deal? Maybe he's moved on and isn't out for revenge. You never know,\" she sighed, shrugging. \"I don't think it will be like that, Jan,\" Angel told her daughter, obviously unsettled by this recent development. \"Now come on...let's all go home for the night...\" Stretch drove everyone to their respective homes and then his own. Janet fiddled with her guitar strap as she walked into the small house she shared with her mother. Angel quickly shut and locked the door. \"I'm going to bed mom,\" Janet said, yawning and heading into her room that was down the hallway. Angel nodded weakly. Then the telephone rang. Angel jumped at first, then answered it with a quiet, \"Hello?\" \"Hey Angel!\" It was Mylar. \"Your daughter Janet? All the makings of a great star like you!\" he said happily. Angel blinked in confusion. \"Wait...I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a funk. Could you elaborate?\" she stammered, twirling her finger with the curly phone cord. \"I'm saying that I loved her performance! And so did a lot of the club patrons!\" Mylar continued. \"She has great potential to become a big star like your band! I just need her signature on the contract I made so she can get started!\" \"Really?\" Angel asked, happy. \"That's wonderful, Mr. Mylar! How soon can she perform?\" \"Well after she signs my contract, I've got a show for her booked for next week. It'll be an even fuller house, and maybe some famous faces! Always start out your first concert small! Well, yours wasn't, but...still!\" Mylar said. \"Can you bring her by tomorrow so we can go over the contract and she can sign?\" \"Sure!\" Angel said, forgetting her fear of seeing Mok earlier. \"I'll bring her by first thing in the morning!\" \"Faaaaabuloso!\" Mylar exclaimed. \"Ta-ta, Angel!\" And he hung up. Angel grinned widely. Her daughter was growing up so fast. And now she was going to become an official singer, and that was going to be wonderful. A/n: So I am no longer sure if this will be a few short chapters or not XD I'm digging the storyline already. I imagined Janet as a blonde version of Joan Jett, to be honest. Well...looks and voice wise. I wanted to show Janet's show start in this chapter. But worry not, your favourite \"wrinkled cat man\" will appear next chapter! And when the start of the chapter said \"she was going to make her debut as a singer\", that meant it was talent night. She was going to show what potential she had and whether or not Mylar would add her on under her own contract to become professional, I just had to clear that up because I'm too lazy to go in and change that. XD[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: *sigh* I don't own Rock & Rule, sadly. Nelvana owns R&R.; But since they're so disappointed in the film and ignore its existance, can I have it? :D One week later... The \"Modest House of Mok\" sat on the hill, overlooking the distant Ohmtown. Nothing had changed since Mok was last here. As the aging rocker made his way to the window to see the colours of sunset, he was contemplating his new approach for domination. He was glad to finally be out of the pits of the dimension he was thrown in to. He had come back thanks to an extreme fan who was obsessed with Black Magic and summoned him back from the other dimension. As soon as Mok came back, he was grateful he was brought back, but his attitude changed quite quickly. He killed the fan who brought him back mercilessly, not even batting an eyelash at the gory aftermath. He had never felt more alive. What a great way to start life on Earth again, by killing someone. Besides, he was now back with an extreme hatred and bloodlust. He wanted to get back at the blasted Drats that foiled his plot...he laughed madly, imagining his long fingers encircling that Angel's neck and squeezing the life out of her. It was all her fault. He should have killed her after she summoned the beast. \"Toad!\" Mok called, and said Schlepper brother skated into the room with his usual grudgey face. Mok was able to persuade the Schleppers to return to him. They were all less intelligent than he. He used their stupidity to his advantage. He turned back to face Toad. \"Get the car ready. I wish to go for a drive in Ohmtown.\" He wasn't going to kill any Drats tonight. He would save them for his concert in a week. He would need to think of a way to bring another demon from that same dimension and use it to kill them and everyone else in the world. He smirked inwardly. Revenge was sweet. Mok looked out the window during the drive. Nothing had seemed to have changed in the past, what was it, sixteen years? Far too long for Mok's tastes. His fingers drummed on his leg when the car stopped at a red light. He noticed a poster that caught his attention. It had no pictures but it had words. Mok squinted his eyes slightly to make out the words. \"TONIGHT! INTRODUCING... JANET SWAGGER! DON'T MISS HER DEBUT! LOCATION: MYLAR'S CLUB TIME: 7:30 PM-11\" The light was still red. Mok read and reread the poster, his mind reeling and full of confusion. Some girl bore the \"Swagger\" last name? Disgruntled and confused, he decided to see what all of this was about. \"Toad!\" he called to said driver. \"What time is it?\" \"Uhh...seven o'clock. Why?\" Toad replied. \"I want to see a show in town. Drive me to Mylar's club,\" he ordered. Toad grunted in reply and when the light finally turned green, he changed direction and headed for the club. Once they arrived, Mok stepped out and he went inside to find himself a booth in the darkest corner of the club. A few minutes left until he saw who this \"Janet Swagger\" was. He picked up his cigar and lit it, content now that he had something else to do. Toad came in and guarded Mok's table like he usually did. Mok exhaled a mouth full of smoke when Mylar came out onto the stage, grinning widely. \"And now, making her first debut as a rocker, I'd like to introduce you all to Miss Janet Swagger! \" he said loudly, motioning to the stage. Mok looked up at the stage just as the curtains lifted. Well, he saw two of the Drats, the fat one and the nutty skinny one, and saw no trace of any girl. Then finally, he heard guitars being played by Stretch and someone off the stage and the drums being played. Then out came Janet. Mok's eyes widened in surprise. He immediately noticed how the young woman of about sixteen looked very much like Angel, but he was also quick to notice her cat features. She didn't look exactly like him (she got her mother's looks mostly), but Mok knew from the pit of his stomach that this Janet was his daughter. He was gaping, but thankfully no one took notice as everyone else in the club cheered loudly as they saw the beautiful young teen step on stage, microphone in hand. \"Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you, I am nothing more then to saviour of that, And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away, We'll be lost before the dawn...\" The words flowed out smoothly and beautifully from Janet's mouth as she continued singing. Mok was taken aback at how good she could sing. A voice even more beautiful than Angel's...He couldn't believe that this young lady was his own offspring. He smirked to himself. He could use Janet for his personal use in destroying the Drats. No doubt Angel told Janet the bad things about him, but he figured he should just try to change her mind by playing mind games. He was an expert in that field. After a couple of more songs, Mok stood up and left. He had Toad deliver a note to Janet's dressing room. When the show ended, Janet headed off the stage and was given a hug by Angel. \"You did such a great job, honey!\" Janet smiled. \"Thanks mom. But I want to rest up for a bit. Let me get a couple of things from my dressing room and we can go home.\" Angel nodded and Janet went to her room to get her game console and her walkman. Before leaving, she noticed a note on her makeup table. Curious, she picked it up. No initials or anything. She stuffed it in her pocket and decided to read it when she got home. She ran out of her room and joined her mother and Stretch drove them home. A/n: Sorry for the short chapter. XD Not like anyone's reading this...and the lyrics are by Evanescence. It's their most beautiful song IMO, it's called \"Before the Dawn\". Even though Janet is a bit off of Joan Jett, I like mixing in some other bands.[Chapter 4] A/n: I'm happy to get reviews for this! And I think I'm addicted to Debbie Harry's remake of \"Angel's Song;\" if you haven't heard it, it's called \"Maybe for Sure.\" It's awesome. Disclaimer: *sigh* I don't own Rock & Rule, sadly. Nelvana owns R&R.; But since they're so disappointed in the film and ignore its existance, can I have it? :D The lyrics belong to Cheap Trick. Because Omar's songs are performed by that band, so there you go. Janet came out of her shower, now dressed in her nightgown, and flopped down onto her bed. Reaching into her pants pocket that was thrown onto her bed, she pulled out the envelope that she had found earlier. Her delicate fingers traced the seal of the envelope, and she debated with herself whether or not she wanted to read what was inside. But there was some unseen force (or maybe she was just imagining it) that was drawing her interest. She quickly ripped open the envelope and pulled out... \"Huh? A blank card?\" Janet asked herself dumbly, raising an eyebrow and turning the card over. Was this some joke? Then the card began to glow upwards and Janet dropped it on the floor in surprise. She watched in fear and amazement as words began to form. The glow dimmed and words were now etched into the card. She bent over and picked up the card again. 'Dear, Sweet Jan, I am terribly sorry we haven't had a chance to ever meet or talk. Come up to my place tomorrow night so we can catch up. Your father, Mok' Janet bit her lip. Mok? Her father? He wanted to see her? The Satanic rocker who tried to destroy the world years ago? No way. She would never go see him. She wouldn't meet that psycho! Especially not after what he did to her mother! But the rebellious spirit in her made her interested. Why shouldn't she go? It could be an adventure! She could finally meet her father! After all, he's the biggest rocker in history! The biggest thing since World War Three! He was Mok Swagger for Christ's sake! Maybe he's changed. Maybe he's not the same lunatic her mother and Dizzy and Stretch once knew. She had to meet him! \"Yeah only how would that work?\" Janet asked herself, throwing her face into her pillow. \"I don't have a freakin' car or a license yet, and I know Stretch wouldn't have enough guts to take me there. And he'd probably blab to mother. Oh and how would Mom react? What would I even say? 'Oh mom, can I go see my dad Mok? He wants to see me! So what if he raped you? I wanna meet him!' Fat chance that'll go well with her.\" She rolled over onto her back and turned her lamp off. She was now staring up at the ceiling in the dark. She could always flag down a cab. But wait. Cabs probably would take the longer way so they could charge her more. And she didn't have much money to herself to begin with anyway. So a cab is out the question. Damn, this was the future! Where were those transporter thingies that were shown in those sci-fi shows from the ancient 1970s? Oh well. One way or another, she would find a way to show up to Mok's tomorrow night. The next night after a practice gig, Jan looked at her mother and gulped slightly. She hoped her lie would work. She cleared her throat. \"Hey mom?\" \"Yes Jan?\" Angel asked her daughter, smiling. \"I'm gonna go for a walk then hang out with some friends. Is that okay?\" she continued. \"Of course, Jan,\" Angel replied, ruffling her daughter's hair. Damn did Jan hate that. \"Just be home by eleven o'clock. And be safe.\" Janet nodded and slipped off to the streets of Ohmtown. Looking up at the sky, she frowned. Ohmtown for as long as she had known it had always been beautiful. And ever since Mok had come back, the storms returned. She knew all about them from her mother's stories from years ago, but it was slightly unnerving to never see the sun peek out. She walked down a few blocks and met the person who was going to take her to Mok's, and she explained why he was here to take her there. He was a mouse person, tall, and had black hair. He looked disgruntled. \"Jan,\" he said, \"when you asked for a favour, I didn't expecct me being your freaking chauffeur to that crazy Magic Man's.\" \"Chris,\" Janet replied icily, \"We broke up. I'm not going to be your little girl to the side anymore. And we were young! I realized since then I like girls. Besides, you still owe me a favour after I saved your ass from Quadhole.\" Chris sighed and got into his car. \"Get in then,\" he muttered, starting the engine. Janet did so. The car roared to life and Chris began driving. There was awkward silence the whole ride. Two exes in a car. Awkward. \"Why don't you turn on the radio?\" Jan asked, looking out the window. Chris only grunted and pushed a couple of buttons to make the radio turn on. Some rock song was just ending and the radio station host introduced the next song. \"This is a new song from The Omars!\" he said, then the music starting playing. \"I want you to want me, I need you to need me, I'd love you to love me, I'm begging you to beg me, I want you to want me, I need you to need me...\" Janet bit her lip slightly. That was the voice on the records her mother always listened to with such heartbreak. Omar. He was the asshole who left her mother before she was even born. Angel was always sad whenever she heard his new band's records. Chris looked over at Janet. \"You okay, Jan?\" he asked her. Janet only nodded. \"We're almost there.\" Janet's stomach did flip-flops with each second that passed. She would be seeing her father in person for the first time. She knew he was an evil guy, but she still wanted to see him. No matter how much it made her fret. In no time at all, they arrived at Mok's mansion. Janet got out and looked at Chris. \"You coming in?\" she asked him. \"Nah, I'm going to go hang out with my pals. Just message me when you want me to pick you up,\" he replied. Janet nodded and Chris sped off. Janet looked up at the intimidating building and breathed slowly. She timidly made her way to the door and waited for the door to allow her entry. ...'Cause Cheap Trick. ","Summary":" A/n: I realize I should be working on updating my Harry Potter stories, but ugh! This idea came to "},{"Movie":"Smallfoot","Title":"You Inspired Me","Author":"Sunnyflight170","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13176516","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I'm going to apologize in advance if any of this information is incorrect. I tried to get it as accurate as possible, but I may have made a few mistakes here and there. See you at the end of the chapter! DISCLAIMER: I don't own Brenda or Percy. everyone else is an OC. ... Six years ago, in St. Petersburg, Florida… \"Bye mom! I'll be back later!\" I called, pausing in the doorway and waiting for a response. \"Okay sweetie! Call me when you get there, and if you're going to stay for dinner,\" my mother's voice floated out from the kitchen. \"I will,\" I promised her, stepping outside and shutting the door behind me. I walked quickly down the sidewalk to Erin's house, my bag swinging from my shoulder and bouncing against my hip. This was a weekly occurrence for me. On Saturday, I would go to one of my friend's houses for three weeks, and then we would go to mine. Today was Erin's weekend. Erin lived within walking distance of me, while Alyssa and Lucy lived across town in different directions. I took the bus to get there. I arrived to Erin's house and after dropping a quick text to my mom, climbed up her steps and knocked on the door. It opened after a few seconds, and Erin's mother smiled at me warmly. \"Hi Brenda. Come on in- Erin is in the kitchen. You know where it is.\" \"Thanks Mrs. Carter.\" I walked inside, smiling at her gratefully before making my way to the kitchen. I could hear laughter, and I smiled to myself as I came to the door. The three of looked up at me and beamed. \"Brenda!\" Alyssa said. \"Join us- we were just talking about how Jasper totally has a crush on Lucy.\" \"He does not !\" Lucy said, turning pink. I smiled as I sat down. I personally wasn't interested in boys and how cute they were. I was too busy with my education. And besides- I knew most of the boys in school, and they weren't really my type. But I had no problem discussing crushes with my friends. \"Why wouldn't he?\" I asked. \"You're awesome! He would be lucky to score with you!\" \"You really think he might like me?\" Lucy asked hopefully. \"Obviously,\" Erin said. She started to say something else, but perked up, her eyes brightening. \"It's on!\" she squealed, jumping to her feet. We all exchanged glances before blinking at her. \"Uh… what is?\" Lucy ventured. \"Creatures, With Percy Patterson!\" \"Creatures? You mean like animals?\" Alyssa asked. \"Why do you want to watch that show?\" I was wondering the same thing. None of us were really animal people, especially Erin. I had a cat, and whenever the girls came over, Alyssa and Lucy would fuss over her and cuddle with her. Erin would smile tensely and awkwardly pat her on the head before moving off to my room. Out of all of us, she liked animals the least . This was strange. There had to be some other reason. \"Because the host is totally adorable!\" There it is , I thought to myself, smiling inwardly. \"His name is Percy Patterson. He gets so excited when he talks about those 'creatures',\" she said, with air quotes around creatures. \"And it is so cute ! I saw him while my little brother was watching it, and I just join him for every episode. He's so excited to spend time with me that he doesn't question it. Not that I don't love spending time with him too.\" she grinned at us. \"The host is just a completely unrelated bonus.\" \"Let's go see then!\" Alyssa said, sounding excited. \"I want to see if he's as cute as you say he is.\" she rushed for the living room, Lucy and Erin on her heels. I followed more slowly behind. They could gush over this \"cute tv host\" all they wanted. I'd just get on my cell and scroll through some of my favorite sites. \" Here we see a pair of lionesses hunting an antelope,\" a voice coming from the tv said. Alyssa launched herself over the couch and plopped into the seat. Erin sat on the other side of her, next to her brother, and Lucy sat down on the floor. I leaned against the back, reaching into my bag for my cell phone. While I waited for it to load, I glanced at the tv. Percy was still talking about the female lions hunting. What had he called them? Lionesses? I didn't know there was a different word for female lions than male lions… \" Watch them as the stalk the gazelle ,\" Percy said, his voice soft and low. \" They creep along the ground until they are both within thirty feet, and then… they charge! \" I locked my eyes on them as they ran. They looked so elegant, the way they were running. It was beautiful . \" Unfortunately, they miss the antelope this time ,\" Percy's voice continued. \" Lionesses are only successful roughly thirty percent of the time .\" \"When do we get to see him?\" Lucy asked. \"Is the whole show just his voice and a bunch of animals?\" \"He'll show up eventually,\" Erin said, her voice confident. Just as she said this, a boy with orange-red hair appeared on the screen. \"Behind me, you can see a few lion cubs playing with each other. There at a farther distance then what the cameras make it look. We don't want to upset the other lions by getting to close, after all,\" he said. \"We always need to respect the personal space of creatures.\" the camera cut to the lion cubs as they rolled around on the ground. \"Isn't he cute?!\" Erin squealed. \"Sure is,\" I said distractedly, watching the cubs play. I heard gasps around me, and looked at my friends in confusion. \"What?\" \"You just said you think he's cute,\" Erin said, staring at me as a smile spread across her face. \"I thought you weren't into boys yet?\" Lucy asked me. \"You said-\" \"Don't question her!\" Erin said. \"You'll ruin it! Brenda, this is fantastic!\" \"Oh, uh…\" I felt my cheeks grow warm. How would I explain to them I had been referring to the cubs, not Percy? \"Look, she's blushing!\" Alyssa squealed. \"She really does think he's cute!\" \"I guess so,\" I said vaguely. I didn't want to disappoint them, after all. \"But don't get any ideas. He's one guy, and there is no way I'll meet him. Everyone is allowed to have one unrealistic star crush, right?\" \"True,\" Erin admitted. \"All right, we'll leave you alone about it. It's still a momentous occasion, though! I am so marking this on my calendar.\" I rolled my eyes, laughing. \"Yeah, yeah. Let's just finish the show, all right?\" \"Okay,\" Erin agreed. We continued watching the show, and the subject was dropped. When it was over, we went to Erin's room to chat. Homework, classes, boys; we ranged through several different topics. At about six Alyssa and Lucy had to leave to catch the bus, and I decided to leave too. I said goodbye to Erin and headed for home. I caught myself returning to the moment in the living room, watching the lionesses run. I couldn't get the show out of my head. It had taught me things about lions that I never even knew, and they were actually pretty cool. I was wondering… what other animals did they cover on that show? I got my phone out and looked up Patterson Animals , and after a few links for veterinarians… \"Bingo,\" I whispered, clicking on a link that said \"list of Creatures! With Percy Patterson episodes\". There were episodes on bears, bobcats, and coyotes, but also animals I hadn't ever heard of, like kangaroo rats and javelina. Then there were episodes that had animals like kangaroos or lemurs. Kangaroos only lived in Australia, I knew that. But what about lemurs? Did they live in Australia too? I glanced up, realizing I had almost passed my house. I walked up our sidewalk in inside. \"I'm home, mom!\" I called before heading for our living room. My older sister was seated on the couch, watching Big Bang Theory. \"Hey Charlie,\" I said as a joined her. \"Can I borrow the tv for a sec? I just want to look something up.\" \"Okay,\" she agreed as the show switched to a commercial. \"But make it quick. I don't want to miss anything.\" \"This won't take long,\" I promised. I went to the menu and clicked search, then typed in CREATU. The show popped up, just under creature comforts. I clicked it and set all the episodes to record. I wanted to watch everything. \"Why are you recording that show?\" Charlie asked me as hit the exit button and turned it back to the tv. \"I didn't think you cared much for animals.\" \"I don't. Or, I didn't,\" I admitted. \"I saw the show over at Erin's house, and it's really educational. I learned some much about lions that I never knew before. Did you know that usually the lionesses are the ones hunting, and they hunt in pairs or groups?\" Charlie looked interested. \"I didn't. That's actually pretty cool. Maybe I'll join you when you watch.\" \"That would be great,\" I said, smiling at her. \"Erin watches it with her brother, but she mainly watches it for the 'cute tv host,'\" I said with an eye roll. \"Ooh, that's pretty bad,\" Charlie said, cringing. \"Well, I swear I'm going to watch so I can spend time with you and learn about animals, not for some cute guy halfway across the world.\" she smiled at me, and I laughed. \"Thanks,\" I said gratefully. \"I think the first episode records later tonight. We can watch together then.\" From that moment on, Charlie and I watched every episode we could together. we followed Percy on instagram, so we'd get updates about the show or just pictures of animals. My friends were happy to discover I had a bunch of the episodes on our DVR, and wanted to watch at least one whenever they came over. I made Charlie promise not to tell them why I wanted to watch. It really wasn't a big deal and they probably wouldn't mind, but I didn't want to take the chance. While they gushed about how cute Percy was, Charlie and I paid attention and learned about whatever the center of the episode was. I had learned more about animals in the year than I had in years past. My seventeenth birthday came, and while my parents and friends got me clothes and jewelry, Charlie took me aside privately to give me an endangered animals book and a book titled rainforest with pictures a man named Thomas had taken. They were my favorites. One morning a few weeks after, while I was getting ready for school, I found a gecko sitting on my backpack. I crouched next to them carefully, trying not to disturb them. It looked like a male, with its bright color and how big it was. It was still pretty young, since they were fourteen inches as adults and this one was only six. I flashed back to last week when we'd seen the episode about geckos. They had the ability to climb up walls. When I first heard of a gecko and what they did, I'd assumed they had sticky feet and that was why they could climb. But it turned out they had microscopic hairs called setae on their toe pads, and they had an electric charge that attracted to the electric charge in whatever surface they were touching. This was what allowed them to climb walls. The episode had also said that a tokay- that's what this species of gecko was- was one of the more aggressive species of gecko. They tended to bite, and though they weren't poisonous, I could get an infection if it bit me. I carefully moved passed it and grabbed a pair of gloves from the closet. I hardly used them, but my mom wanted us each to have some in case the temperature got abnormally low. I put them on and returned to the gecko. I sat next to him again. \"I'm sorry little guy,\" I whispered apologetically. \"But you can't stay here. My mom would freak, or my cat might go after you. And I'd hate for someone step on you by accident, if you managed to avoid them.\" I very, very carefully reached out and grabbed him, holding him gently but firmly in the center of my hands. He thrashed and struggled immediately- I wouldn't be able to hold him long. I rushed out of my room. \"Where are you going in such a hurry?\" Charlie asked me as I swerved around her. \"Can't talk!\" I called over my shoulder. \"Gecko emergency!\" \"Gecko?\" Charlie's footsteps followed behind me as i ran for the door. I looked down at the tokay, who was still angrily struggling in my hands. \"Almost there, little guy,\" I whispered. Charlie rushed ahead and got the door for me, and i sprinted outside and crouched on the sidewalk. I opened my hands, and the tokay jumped off and landed a couple feet away. Charlie came to sit by me, looking at the gecko in wonder. \"Wow,\" she said quietly. \"I've never seen one this close before.\" \"Me neither,\" I said quietly. I shook my head and stood up. \"We have to get to school,\" I said to her, heading back inside. I went to my room and opened my backpack, checking to make sure everything was there. Textbooks, notebooks, Rainforest , folders, binder… yes, that was everything. I zipped it and put it on, grabbing my pencil from the floor and going out to the kitchen to wait for Charlie before we walked to school. She came out a few minutes later. \"Mom! Brenda and I are going to school now!\" she called out. \"Okay! See you after it's over!\" she called back. We walked outside. \"So,\" Charlie said casually. I glanced over at her to find her watching me intently. \"When are you going to tell your friends how much you love animals?\" \"I'm not,\" I told her. \"They don't need to know.\" \"But they still think you're watching Creatures! Because of the host, don't they?\" \"Yeah, and I'm going to let them believe that.\" I walked faster. \"Hurry up, I don't want to be late.\" she caught up with me, but didn't bring up the subject again. I bit my lip. \"Sorry,\" I said to her. \"It's just… they're my best friends. I don't think they could ever love animals as much as we do, and I don't want to make them feel like they have to.\" \"I get it,\" Charlie said. \"I really do. How about this? You don't have to tell them outright that you love animals, but you should at least stop hiding it. If they're your real friends, they will understand.\" \"All right,\" I agreed as I stopped walking. \"My rainforest book is in my backpack. Can you get it for me? I'll carry it around in my arms instead.\" \"Sure!\" Charlie said, sounding happy. She got it out for me and handed it over. I hugged it to my chest as she zipped my backpack. \"Come on,\" I said when she was done. \"We have to hurry before we're late.\" we rushed off to school, walking in the door roughly three minutes before the bell. Charlie threw her arm around my shoulders and squeezed. \"See you after school, sis,\" she said before rushing off to her first class. She liked to arrive early. I waved before going to the table where I usually met my friends before we all went our different ways. \"Hey guys,\" I said as I joined them. \"Brenda! Are you prepared for the end of the term?\" Erin asked me. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I'm passing all my classes, so today should be pretty easy for me.\" \"Do we have any classes together?\" Lucy asked, pulling her schedule out. \"I think I have algebra with Erin…\" we all pulled are schedules out and quickly compared them. I had chemistry with Alyssa and composition with Erin, and Lucy and I had the same lunch. The bell rang and I grabbed my backpack. Holding my book and schedule in my arms, I rushed off to my first class. I sat through algebra and geography- they both went fast, because we spent most of the period taking notes or working on homework. It wasn't finished, but what I couldn't do in class I could finish at lunch or during free time in other classes. I walked in the door to teen leadership and sat at my desk, immediately opening my book to where I'd left off. I smiled down at the green whip snake on the page, then read what Thomas had to say about it. The room slowly grew louder as other students entered, but I paid no attention to them. I heard the bell ring and marked my page, closing the book and looking up at Mrs. Anderson. She beamed at us. \"Good morning, class.\" \"Good morning,\" I said, along with a few others. \"Today we're going to write a letter to someone we admire. You'll mail it yourself, unless the person is unreachable or no longer with us. You can work on it at home if you want, if you have work you need to do for other classes. But tell me who you plan on writing, so I can get an address for you.\" The moment she stopped talking, the class erupted in soft whispers and murmurs. I pulled a piece of paper from my notebook and carefully tore the frilly edges from it. When they were completely off, I twirled my pencil in my fingers as I thought. The minute I heard our assignment, I knew I wanted to write to Percy. Now it was just a matter of how to start. Dear Percy , I wrote. I stared at it for a few moments, then erased his name. Too formal , I thought. He wasn't my friend- I couldn't just call him Percy like I'd known him for years. Instead, I wrote Mr. Patterson . That was better. Next I wrote hi, I'm Brenda . Then I erased that too. Instead I tried my name is Brenda . Thinking for a second, I wrote my teacher wants us to write to somebody we admire. And for me, that's you. I've watched your show for about a year now. I love it- it's taught me so much about animals that I never knew before. You inspired me to love the earth and all the creatures in it. You've changed my life. I stared down at it, frowning. This wasn't good enough. I started to erase, careful to make sure I didn't rip it. When the whole paragraph was gone, I erased the little bits that I had missed. They were still slightly visible, but I supposed I could just use this as a rough copy and then write the final draft on a different piece. I started the letter over several times- nothing I wrote seemed like it would work. Finally, I decided to write down key points I wanted to mention. -the assignment- it's important to be honest -how he inspired me -when i started watching his show -how much i love animals because of him -how much it taught me I looked at my list, then took another page from my notebook and removed the frilly bit. Breathing in deeply, I began to write. When I was done, I folded it and stuck it in an envelope on the corner of my desk that Mrs. Anderson must have put there without me noticing. I sealed it, then flipped it over and printed Percy's name neatly in the middle. I wrote my own information up in the left corner. Brenda Williams 2499 3rd Ave N St. Petersburg, FL 33713 I brought it up to Mrs. Anderson's desk and told her where it was meant to go, then returned to my seat. No going back now… Six days later, in Coyote, New Mexico… \"Percy!\" Mom's voice called. \"I've got something for you!\" I turned away from my desk to see her leaning against my frame, holding something long and white in her hands. I rolled my eyes. \"Another fan letter? Seriously?\" \"Oh come on Percy,\" she coaxed. \"Your fans love you! You could at least read them.\" \"I told you before mom; I don't mind reading the ones that actually like the show.\" \"How do you know she doesn't? Come on, give her a chance.\" and by that, she meant she wanted me to think about getting into a relationship with her. Also known as, finally get a girlfriend. She'd been begging me to start looking for a while now. Every time a new letter from a female came, she tried to get me to contact the girl and ask to meet her. I shook my head. \"I'm busy- the editor is sick, so I have to edit this week's episode myself. 'She', you said? I don't have time to read another fangirl's letter.\" \"Please? It will just take five minutes. And you need a break- you've been in your room all day. It's already two and you haven't eaten. I have a sandwich for you in the kitchen!\" \" Alright! \" I snapped, shoving my chair back from the desk and getting to my feet. \"I'll read it, if it gets you to let me edit in peace. It's a lot harder than it looks.\" \"Deal,\" my mom agreed, beaming at me as she held out the letter. I took it from her and put my finger under the flap, tearing it open. I pulled out a neatly folded paper and unfolded it, holding the envelope behind it. Dear Mr. Patterson , it started. I was slightly surprised- most of the fangirl letters started with \"Hey Percy!\" and then had something along the lines of \"your so cute when you talk about those creatures!\" \"Its awesome how much you love animals!\" or the worst one of all: \"My brother and sister just want to say how much they love your show. P.S: You are super cute! Here's my number- hit me up!\" I quickly pushed down my surprise. Just because this one started out slightly more respectful didn't mean she wouldn't be just like the others. I continued to read. Our teacher gave us an assignment to write a letter to somebody we admire. I instantly thought of you- ever since I saw your show at a friends house about a year ago, the one about lions, I've watched you ever since. I never really cared for animals before I saw your show, but you inspired me. I've learned so much about animals since then. Things i never even knew. Animals I used to be afraid of, like spiders, don't scare me anymore. All thanks to you. So, I want to say thank you. Thank you for being such a big role model. You changed my life. -Brenda \"She seems nice,\" My mom's voice spoke in my ear. I jumped, stepping away from her with a hand on my chest. \"Wha- when did you get here?!\" \"A few moments ago,\" she said casually. \"That Brenda girl seems nice.\" \"She does, doesn't she?\" I said, looking down at the letter. \"I might just have to write her back.\" \"Really?\" my mom said, sounding excited. \"You think you might want to settle down with her?\" \"No, mom, not to ask her to be my girlfriend. I was thinking more along the lines of… a partner.\" To Be Continued…. … just to clarify, Brenda's address is not a real one (as far as I know). I made it up for this story.[Chapter 2] this chapter is a lot shorter then the first. I really don't have a plan for when to end these, things just sort of... happen, you know? anyway, enjoy! DISCLAIMER: I don't own Percy or Brenda. ... \"Ugh, this chemistry homework is the worst!\" Erin groaned, placing her head in her arms. \"It's not so bad,\" I told her. She and Lucy had the class too, but at a different time then me an Alyssa. The teacher had given us a new assignment at the end of class on Friday, so we decided to work on it together on Saturday. We figured as long as we didn't share answers, it would be okay. \"Brenda's right,\" Lucy said. \"I'm almost done with mine.\" \"I am too,\" Erin admitted. \"But that doesn't make it less horrible.\" We all laughed, and I smiled inwardly. These moments with my friends helped to keep my mind off of the letter I'd sent to Percy. It'd been nearly two weeks, and I hadn't gotten a return letter. I kept telling myself it was all right- I hadn't really been expecting a response. He was a huge star, after all. Why would he respond to a random fan? We were still laughing when Charlie came charging into my room. \"Brenda!\" she said, panting with her hands on her knees. She blinked up at us. \"What's so funny?\" when Alyssa opened her mouth to explain, Charlie waved her hand in the air. \"No, nevermind. I don't need to know. Brenda! You have to check this out!\" she waved something at me, and I rolled my eyes, still giggling. \"Show me what?\" I asked. She launched herself onto the bed next to me, putting her arm around me and putting the thing in front of us. It was a letter. Brenda Wilson , it said in the middle. I glanced up to the top left corner, and my heart skipped a beat. I grabbed the letter in both hands. \" Oh my gosh! \" I yelled, bouncing up and down. Charlie laughed and hugged me. Erin looked over her shoulder and gasped. \"Percy Patterson?!\" she cried. \"Brenda got a letter from Percy Patterson!\" \"What?!\" Lucy and Alyssa yelled. \"Brenda, why are you getting a letter from Percy? How does he know you?\" Lucy asked me. I breathed in deeply, trying to calm myself, then let it out. \"A few weeks ago, in leadership, we had to write to somebody we admired. I chose Percy. You see…\" I exchanged a glance with Charlie, and she nodded encouragingly. \"Ever since I saw his show at Erin's house, I've been watching it and learning so much about animals. I love them now- I have for the past year.\" \"You did?\" Alyssa asked. \"I didn't know that.\" \"I didn't exactly make it clear,\" I admitted. \"I was a little worried about how you'd react. I know you thought I said he was cute, but I was actually referring to the lion cubs. I didn't know how to explain that without coming off as a liar.\" \"Oh, Brenda,\" Lucy said, sounding sympathetic. \"You could have told us- we'd understand.\" \"Yeah,\" Alyssa agreed. \"We're your friends!\" I smiled at them gratefully. \"Thanks, guys.\" \"You're welcome,\" Erin cut in. \"Not to ruin the moment, but open the letter!\" she bounced on my bed, a big smile on her face. \"I want to know what he said!\" I laughed. \"Okay, okay! I'm opening it!\" I tore the flap and pulled out a paper. I unfolded it, my hands shaking slightly. I glanced around at my friends. \"Do you guys mind if I read it myself? I'll tell you what it says.\" \"Oh, yeah, of course.\" Erin hopped off the bed and sat with Lucy on the couch in the corner. Now it was just me and Charlie. I read the letter silently first. Hello Brenda, it started. First, I want to say thank you for your kind letter. I appreciate letters like yours- ones from people who love animals as much as I do. On that note… If you're interested, I could use some help on the show. Would you like to be my partner? You mentioned a teacher, so I'm assuming you're still in highschool. You should absolutely finish your education first, but if you do want to help out, I could send you clips that we've recorded to check out and give me your opinion on what should be put in the show and what shouldn't. I can also send you the script. I write it myself, but it would be nice to have someone to double check and possibly add improvements. This is only if you're interested, of course. If not, I understand. I'm including my email address at the bottom- it's much faster then letter writing, especially if we are going to become partners. It's been awhile since I got a letter from someone like you. Thank you again for writing me. -Percy Patterson P.S.- call me Percy. \"Well?\" Erin asked eagerly, leaning forward. \"What did he say?\" \"He wants me to be his partner,\" I said, a slow smile spreading across my face. \"He wants me to be his partner !\" \"That's fantastic!\" Lucy said, smiling at me. \"We're so happy for you!\" \"You're going to say yes, right?\" Alyssa asked me. \"Oh, Brenda, you have to accept! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity!\" Erin said, bouncing up and down on the couch. I laughed. \"I'm going to accept,\" I told them. \"I'll have to work out the details with him later to see what I'm all going to do.\" \"Later? Why not now?\" Lucy asked. I raised my eyebrows. \"Uh, the chemistry homework?\" \"Let's get cracking then! You have a tv show host to write!\" Erin grabbed the various papers from around the room and distributed them to their respective owners. Charlie left, and we got busy immediately. For about twenty minutes, all that could be heard was the scratching of our pencils on the paper and the occasional huff as we came across difficult problems. As I was just finishing up, an alarm sounded and I jumped. \"Sorry,\" Alyssa apologized. \"I set an alarm for five thirty five so Lucy and I could catch the bus.\" she began packing up her stuff, and Lucy joined her. \"Don't you guys usually leave at six?\" Erin asked. \"Yeah, but we got tired of running to catch the bus before it left, so we set it for earlier so we could take our time,\" Lucy explained. \"Ah, I see,\" I said nodding. \"See you tomorrow, guys,\" Alyssa said, shouldering her bag. She and Lucy walked out the door, and Erin set her pencil down. \"I guess I should go too,\" she said. \"But I want to hear everything that happens!\" \"I'll text you all tomorrow,\" I promised her. \"See you later!\" \"Bye!\" she waved to me before walking out the door. When she was gone, I looked down at my homework and finished up the last problem. I put the sheet in my backpack, then took my laptop from my desk. I typed in the password and opened my email, creating a new draft. I typed in Percy's email, then leaned back and debated what to write. Finally, after a few minutes, I typed hello in the subject line and then clicked in the message part. I hesitated for a second, then typed out: Hi, Percy. I would love to be your partner. What do you need me to do? Perfect , I thought. Short and simple. Before I could change my mind, I hit send and quickly closed the laptop. Out of sight, out of mind. If I kept it open, I would stare at the email and slowly start to stress about it. I needed a distraction. \"Brenda! Dinner's ready!\" mom called. I smiled. Perfect timing. \"Coming!\" I said, placing the laptop on my desk. I turned my light off and went out to the table, sitting next to Charlie. I secretly gave her a thumbs up. Now all I had to do was wait for a response. … \"Percy,\" a voice said softly. I moaned, burying my head deeper in my arms. \"G'away,\" I muttered to the voice. \"Percy, honey, you need to look at your computer.\" \"Computer,\" I mumbled. \"Yesterday. The show. Editing.\" my eyes shot wide open, and I jerked upright. \"Oh no, no! I was editing! Did I mess something up?!\" \"Hey, calm down,\" My mom said, touching my shoulders gently. \"You didn't mess it up. You finished it last night, and it looks like you were going to send and email to George to tell him you were done before you fell asleep on the keyboard.\" I peered at the screen, and saw an email open that said Hey geirge, hiw yiu doing? I fubally finisged the edutibg- iys lot hrder theb ut lokdc.. Ccccc cccccccccccdryccccccccccccccccc, etcetera. It looked like I'd fallen asleep on the c key. In the corner, it said 6:15 (9 hours ago). I looked at the clock- it was almost four. I'd been asleep for about nine hours, give or take a few. I drove my hands through my hair, groaning. \"I actually sent that to him? I sound crazy!\" \"Looks like it,\" My mom said sympathetically. \"You must have woken up enough to hit send, then fallen back asleep. You were just tired, I'm sure George understands.\" I sighed, putting my face in my hands. \"I had no idea how long editing took,\" I mumbled from behind them. \"I just barely got it done for tomorrow.\" I glanced up at her. \"Is that what you wanted to show me?\" \"No. It was on your Inbox, but I clicked on this one to see what George said to you. He advised you get some sleep, by the way.\" I rolled my eyes, then looked at her in confusion. \"Then what did you want me to see?\" \"Brenda has emailed you!\" she said, beaming. \"She did?\" I clicked on my Inbox, and sure enough, there was an email from Brenda at the top. It had come in at 3:45. I clicked it, slowly starting to smile. She'd said yes. She'd actually said yes . I cheered, punching my fist in the air. \"Yeah!\" My mom laughed as I clicked the reply button. Hi Brenda, I typed out. I'm going to get started on a script soon. I'll share the document with you, so you can offer ideas too. We're doing the next show on mountain lions. When we've recorded all the clips, I'll put them in the document too so we can look them over and decide which ones to use. I'll put a few facts in it so we have something to work with. I hit send, then went into the drive to open up a new document. I titled it script , then typed mountain lions at the top. I underlined it and hit the bullet point option up in the corner. I started to type out my first fact- Mountain lions live their lives mostly on their own, unlike lions, who live in prides. When hunting, mountain lions \"Oh no,\" My mom interrupted. She grabbed my forearm and pulled me to my feet, away from the desk. She shut my computer with her hand, then pulled me out of the room. \"Mom,\" I protested, my feet sliding against the carpet as I tried to pull away. \"I still have to share it with Brenda so we can work together!\" \"It can wait,\" she said dismissively. \"You haven't eaten a thing since yesterday. When you have some ramen or a sandwich or something, then you can send the document to Brenda.\" \"Fine, fine,\" I grumbled. I looked longingly back at my room. I wanted to get started right away, but there was no way I would be getting out of this. I'd just have to wait a bit longer… ... if anyone is confused with the time stamps and stuff, Percy is about two hours behind Brenda.

I feel for the title. Regards ... I have always faced a situation that can be put in my own security account, as well as being a documentalist of the wild life, which is not always safe and has not always gone according to plan, sometimes as situations more terrifying, but I never believed that I could experience the greatest fear of my life ... I wanted my body to give me enough skills to be able to run faster ... I wanted so much to be able to return with my friends ... I wanted so much to feel again the feeling of being safe and secure ... but above all I wished I had heard Brenda or Migo, my dear yeti. After that we have to return about 11 days ago from this nightmare ... Wednesday 10:15 am On a beautiful day in the Himalayas you see Percy Patterson preparing to spend a whole week off with his Yetis friends in his small village at the foot of the mountain, some yetis after the months of revealing themselves to the world have taken the decision to live below, while for the most part they had made the decision to return to their already established homes at the top. Tell me Percy you have everything ready for your week with the others. Of course, I have everything I need, Percy said excitedly to his best friend Brenda. You are sure that you still want to continue with the plan to spend this week with the others, it would not be better to postpone it for a few days as in this week some very strong storms have been forecast. Please, Brenda, relax, I'll be fine with Migo and the others, and I promised them that after returning from the trip we had, I would spend some time with them in their town to make up for the lost time. I do not doubt that you can be safe with them, but I have been feeling the worry that maybe you should wait only a few days, besides as you said, we have just returned from that trip and you should at least take a few days to rest, Migo and the others could come down and be able to do everything they have planned. I'll be fine, you do not have to worry. Percy said one more time before a thumping sound hit the door of his home. Apparently they're already here to pick you up, \"Brenda said, still uncertain of her friend's decision. Are you sure you do not want to come ?, Maybe so you can be less worried. I will not be well, I also want to be here in case something comes up, which I hope will not be the case. Percy just gave a soft sigh in defeat, unable to convince Brenda that everything would be fine. Well it's time to go Percy said cheerfully as he took his backpack and joined Brenda went to the exit to meet the yeti who knew who it was. A if it was, the huge yeti was just outside his house leaning as he gave a very friendly greeting to both humans. Hi Migo greeting Percy with the same allergy that the yeti had shown. Ready to go, I have been very excited about this and I have not stopped thinking about the fun times we can spend together I mention a very happy yeti. Percy could only smile even more at the overflowing joy on Migo's part. That's the attitude, well, Brenda see you in a week, I'll be calling from time to time to tell you how I am and how things are going. I hope so. Percy Patterson said Brenda last. Quiet everything will be fine Percy finally replied as he went to the big blue hand of the yeti that was waiting for him to carry on his shoulder. While both were ready to go to their destination. Migo! Brenda finally exclaimed in order to draw the attention of the great sasquatch. I listen to your call, I turn Brenda to take note of the request or favor that could ask you for the small foot. Please take care of Percy and prevent him from doing anything crazy or stupid. It's seriously Brenda argued Percy to Brenda for the request she was holding the Yeti. In this case, Brenda could only grumble with a frown in the direction of Percy, who is on Migo's shoulder. Of course Brenda, I will take care of keeping Percy safe, the yeti intervened to avoid any possible dispute between the two. Seriously Migo, object Percy asia Migo. Thanks Migo said a little calmer Brenda. Well, it's enough of unnecessary worries for me, it's time to leave before it's done later. Of course I say Migo. When they said their last goodbye to Brenda, they both went back to the destination they had set for themselves. Brenda could only observe how they both disappeared into the forest towards the mountain, what she did not know was that her feeling that something dangerous would happen would become real. To be continue…[Chapter 2] Wednesday 20:47 pm After a long walk to reach the village established by the Yetis. Migo and Percy entered the cave that was the home of the Yeti. Migo have finally returned and you have finally brought the lovely Percy, Hello. Without warning Kolka receives both with an affectionate welcome, just as he snatches the small foot from Migo's shoulder. Who is a beauty, you are, if you are, I miss you so much, as I love you so much Kolka said in a very affectionate way to the little human who at the same time stroked against his face. I missed you too Kolka indicated a crushed Percy. Calm Kolka, I know you're as excited as I was that Percy will be with us, but try a little to not crush him a lot Migo said, wanting to diminish Kolka's effusiveness a bit. Yes, I'm sorry, I think I'm a little bit moved by placing Percy in his palm. Quiet, I'm also excited to be with all of you I quote an equally cheerful Percy to the emotion of his hairy friend. I want to believe that everyone is gathered inside, because I mentioned that I would pick up Percy. Between so much talk, the hours passed. Right, and tell me Percy, what is the function of this air transport you call plane, how is it possible that being so big and carrying all those humans can fly and travel from one place to another in such long distances asked Meechee. Well, they are more technical things that I am not so informed about, but I suppose I can search my cell phone for a basic idea of its function and be able to explain it, Percy said while emitting a yawn because of how exhausted he was. When Migo noticed the state of the small foot, he decided it was better to finish that day. I think it's time we should end this meeting and allow Percy to rest. Meanwhile Migo was taking the little foot that was in the circular table center where everyone had sat. Or we go Migo, it's still too early to sleep, also I do not think that the small foot is tired said a little annoyed Fleem. If I'm still not so tired, and before Percy finished his sentence, he gave another big yawn. Are you really not tired, Percy? I ask Migo not so convinced. Well maybe a little bit admitted defeated Percy by exhaustion. Migo is right, it will be better to retire and allow Percy to rest, said the leader of the SES team. See you in the morning. Migo, goodbye cute thing, see you tomorrow Kolka said goodbye to his loving style. Come on guys, just a little more reneged one last time Fleem. Nope, it's time to go, see you in the morning, rest both, Gwangi indicated as he headed to the exit dragging Fleem with him. Listening at the end of Fleem's protest grunts that sounded for the exit of the cave being followed by Kolka who said goodbye one last time with his hand. It's a shame that Brenda did not come too, it would have been more fun to be all together, \"said Meechee a little dejected. If I was a little unsure of coming because of some bad feelings I had, or because of the strong storms that would occur this week, Percy explained with a bit of difficulty because of the dream that was overcoming him. Bad forebodings? Meechee questioned not so sure she understood what Percy had mentioned. If I had some kind of intuition that something bad could happen, which is not the case here, Percy finally confirmed by laying on the hand of the yeti that held him. Meechee could only observe something intrigued Percy by what he had mentioned of Brenda's bad feelings about his stay. What could wrong? Meechee asked Migo, since the small foot had already fallen asleep. Migo did not answer as he slightly raised his shoulders with doubt about what was mentioned by Percy. Quiet Meechee, if we are all together and we would not allow anything bad to happen, I completely guarantee positive Migo. Yes, you're right, good night Migo said Meechee as he retired to return home. You too Meechee, good evening Migo said goodbye. Al already in his bed lying with a Percy soundly asleep on his chest and his hand and a special blanket that covered him, could only watch with love and fascination the soft sleep of his little human waiting impatiently for the dawn of the coming day . This will be the coolest week we will spend together and I will be able to confess the feelings I have for you Percy mentioned Migo with great longing and desire the moment he began to give himself to the world of dreams. Meechee who had already arrived at home was very immersed thinking about the bad omens that were mentioned by Brenda. If this bad feeling that Brenda mentioned can indicate a prophecy that may or may not be real, I can not take it lightly, I will have to be as alert as possible so that the stay of the little foot with us does not become a tragedy deduced Meechee a little uncertain.

Jane wandered around the spacious apartment. am Inhopeless? she wondered. I still love Ray…don't I? Is Eddie right? Am Intoo hooked to move on? her eyes then traveled to a slip of paper amidstnher files. HEARTBREAK HOTLINE: a number was listed below. Liz Jane laughed.nAfter some thought, she dialed. \"welcome to Heartbreak Hotline. You will be put through to annavailable mentor shortly!\" Jane gripped the receiver. Mentor? she askednherself, wryly. \"Heartbreak Hotline, Basil speaking. Before we begin, I want you tonknow that this conversation is strictly confidential, and I ask that nonreal names be mentioned. Now, what would you like to be called?\" Jane toldnBasil she wanted to be called DMC (Dr. Marie Charles). She then blurted out her pity. Loving Ray ®, hating ®, moving in withnEddie (E). She told Basil about Dr. Charles, leaving out that she was Dr.nCharles. Basil listened, consoled, and offered advice to Jane. Jane herselfnwondered why such a seemingly perfect man was anonymous. She guessed it wasnher luck. Tough luck. Each day, when Eddie left, Jane tapped in the HH number, andnrequested Basil. More tears were shed, and more and more she began talkingnabout (E), their fights, her sadness over each time he walked out, angry. \"I thought I was moving in technically because I was homeless, and tonget back at ®. I didn't mean to fall in love with him, Basil! Now I thinknI'm in love with you!\" Jane realized. Basil was silent for a moment. \"DMC, that's silly, nuts even! Youncan't fall in love with a voice, someone you know nothing about. You'renstriving too hard for love, my friend, you must let it come to you. Take anbreak. You never know, love might be right under your nose. This is Basil,nsigning off. Have a good day, DMC.\" Finally, Jane decided she had to meet Basil. She looked up HH'snaddress, and set out about an hour after Eddie. \"Basil, please,\" she toldnthe receptionist, who smiled and hit the intercom. \"Basil? Visitor.\" \"Be right down,\" Basil's warm voice replied. Jane's heart hammered.nthis was it. She was meeting the voice of comfort. The elevators slid open,nand she saw him before he saw her. Tall, rugged and handsome, dark touslednhair framed his gentle eyes. Jane froze, and her heart leapt to her throat.nNO, Jane thought, wildly. No, Basil wasn't approaching her. It was EddienAlden. Eddie's eyes met hers, and his mouth dropped, mouthing her name. Thenreceptionist smiled amiably. \"Problem?\" Jane just stammered, and choked out, \"I've been gushing out my heartnto my roommate!!\" She whirled and flew out, oblivious to Eddie, who wasncalling her name. Once in her room, Jane collapsed on her bed, relayingnwhat'd just happened. There was no Basil, just Eddie. She felt cheated andnbetrayed. Why hadn't Eddie told her before she poured her heart out? ANDnshe'd told Basil that she LOVED him! Just then, the apartment door shut,nand Eddie walked in. \"Speak of the devil,\" Jane muttered. \"Jane?\" Eddie appeared at her door. \" Can I help you, Eddie?\" Jane said, emphasizing his name. Eddienalmost flinched at the harsh tone of her voice. \"Jane, I shoulda told you, I know. But you were talking to someone…\"nEddie rambled on and on until Jane kicked him in the shins, shutting himnup. \"Eddie, did you—Basil—mean what you—he—said about love being rightnunder my nose?\" Eddie smiled and lit a cigarette, glancing down at Jane,nbefore pulling her to her feet. \"Yup,\" he said gently. \"Yup, he did.\" ","Summary":" \"eddie, give it back, NOW!\" Jane yelled, but to no avail.

It was then that a title caught her eye. New-Bull-Old-nBull Theory: Why Women Leave Men by Dr. James Turo. Jane was past her stagenas Dr. Marie Charles, but was this a male counterpart? She checked thendate: 4/9/98. Interested, she read on, nodding at some familiar words and notingnunfamiliar ones. This Dr. Turo really knew his stuff! She wished she'dnknown him during her break-up with Ray. Sure, she had Eddie's shoulder tonlean on, but he's still perplexed, to this day, on how her secretivenresearch came about. Jane quickly photocopied the articles and raced down to the studio, slidingnin next to Eddie just as Diane walked in, all smiles. Eddie planted a quicknkiss on Jane's head, gesturing toward the articles. \"Whats this all about?\"nhe whispered. Jane grinned. \"You'll see. Hey Diane, I couldn't get much on the mother ofnthe septuplets, but this should be interesting.\" She held out the articles. Diane studied them earnestly, then clapped her hands happily. \"Jane, thisnis amazing!\" The staff craned their necks to see. \"Before Dr. Charles, Dr.nTuro roamed the spotlight, shining on why women are like we are! Ahem whichnwe're not, but…anyway, this guy is no fluke! He's the real deal!\" She shotna quick, withering glare at Jane, who blushed. Eddie squeezed her armncomfortingly, and glared at Diane. \"Don't you give me that look, Alden. Come on! The actual opposite of Dr.nMarie Charles. The male Dr. Marie Charles! Evelyn! I want Dr. Turo in mynstudio, stat!\" Jane cleared her throat. \"Diane…the bottom helps of his whereabouts,\" she said quietly. Diane scanned to the bottom, her face fell. Eddie glanced up, \"Diane? He'snin Kilimunjaro right now, or something, right?\" He looked at Jane and hid ansmile. Diane shook her head and sighed. \"Nope. Dr. Turo died of heartncomplications in '99.\" She tossed the articles to the side. Jane piped up. \"It's still really interesting, Diane. I mean, right here is the original!nMen everywhere will go nuts!\" Diane glared at Jane again. She obviouslynnever forgave Jane for deceiving her, going on live as Dr. Charles. Eddienshifted so he leaned casually against Jane, obviously annoyed at the looksntheir boss was giving her. Diane scowled, \"Dismissed.\" Later on, back at the apartment, Jane was fuming. \"She treats me like dirtnevery time the name Dr. Charles comes up! She glares at me like I'mninferior! I don't get it, Eddie!\" Eddie sighed. If there was one thing henhated, it was an upset and angry Jane. \"Jane, she's bitter, that's all. She had the chance of a lifetime to reallynbe up there, and in her eyes, you destroyed it. I'll admit, I was close tonbeing destroyed.\" He smiled an apology, and Jane nearly melted. Jane settled down with her laptop and scanned expertly through searchnengines (Dr. James Turo). Jane also mentally scanned Eddie's behavior. Eachntime she called out a small interesting factoid, Eddie responded with anshort, \"Real nice Jane! Research your heart out over a dead guy, what goodnis it gonna do? 'Hi, and welcome to the Diane Roberts Show. Our first guestnis this picture of Dead Dr. James Turo, male counterpart of Dr. MarienCharles',\" Eddie muttered. Jane couldn't even guess what was bothering Eddie, though he often slippedninto moods. But it seemed that whenever Dr. Turo was brought up, Eddienstiffened and acted almost like Diane whenever Dr. Charles was brought up.nCold, almost resentful. It wasn't till later that night that Jane unravelednthe truth. Jane was sorting through a drawer in Eddie's room, searching for a pack ofnNicorettes for him, who recently stopped smoking. Her eyes traveled to annotebook buried beneath papers. The Journal of Me, Eddie Alden. Jane hatednherself the moment she opened the notebook, but her mouth dropped in shock. Written were quick, shorthand notes that mirrored Dr. Turo's. Her heartnbegan racing as it clicked. Dr. James Turo died of heartbreak (that wasnscribbled out)of heart conditions in his home in Seisbee. Seisbee. Seis=nsix, and Bee= B just drawn out. 6B, the apartment Jane and Eddie lived in.nJane smacked the notebook closed, pale. Just then, the door shut, and Eddienwalked in. He seemed shocked to see Jane is his room. He stared at Jane, then at thenbook in her shaking hand. Eddie himself felt like shaking. He thought he'dnnever be angry with Jane, he loved her too much. But now…sneaking around innhis drawers…reading his personal stuff… Jane looked beseechingly at him, and held up a pack of Nicorettes. \"Here…\"nshe mumbled weakly. She raked a hand through her hair. She was so busted.nEddie would never trust her again. At the sight of his shocked face, shenslipped out the door. When Eddie came out, Jane was nowhere in sight. Not in her room, or thenbathroom, or watching TV. Then it came to him. He ran out and headedndownstairs. Jane never went downstairs without him, so all the more reasonnto go down. He found her at the bar, chugging down a Jack Daniels. \"Jane!\" he called.nHer face turned toward him, then back to her drink. \"Jane!\" he caught up tonher and sat next to her. \"Jane, we're one for one. Whatcha see is whatchanget, remember? I saw a 65 yr old woman with a PhD, I got you. You saw a 60nyr old man, you got me. Sorry I didn't tell you, Jane, but it was yearsnago.\" He looked pleadingly at her. Jane just looked at him. \"You know what, Eddie?\" \"No, what?\" \"You're a big jerk.\" Eddie grinned and kissed her head. \"Good to see you understand.\" Janenglared at him, and turned away, making it plain to see that she was notntalking to him. \"Jane…Please, come on. I've been in your position before.nDr. Charles ring a bell?\" He looked expectantly at her. She had to forgivenhim, as he forgave her. Finally, he ordered a beer, sighed, and went backnupstairs. When Jane returned to the apartment, Eddie's door was shut and locked.n\"Typical,\" she muttered, as she stalked to her room. How could Eddie donthis to her? Deceive her, lie to her…she drew a sharp intake of breath. Henwas right. Ugh, she hated when he was right, but he was. An eye for an eye,na tooth for a tooth. Eddie hurt her the same way she hurt him, but henhadn't done it intentionally. Jane shot up in bed as realization hit her.nHow could she be so cruel? He HAD been in her position before! Eddie hadnthe same perspective on relationship problems that Jane herself did, andnpublicized them! It was amazing! Jane Goodale and Eddie Alden were trulynmeant to be! Jane began laughing to herself, before she was clutching hernsides and gasping for breath. \"Something funny?\" Eddie stood in the doorway, hands shoved deep into thenpockets of his jeans, his expression puzzled, yet amused. Jane rolled outnof bed with a smile. \"Eddie…\" she began, walking to where her roommate stood. \"Eddie, look. I'mnsorry, alright? Looks like I was the big jerk, huh?\" To her shock, hengrinned and nodded. Playfully, she smacked his arm. \"Would you listen tonme?\" \"Yeah,\" Eddie replied with an easy smile. \"I'm all ears.\" \"Anyway,\" Jane continued. \"It wasn't till just before that I realized,\" hernexpression turned thoughtful. (AN: Picture her expression during her BIGnDEBUT, got it?) \"We are different, but we're also insanely similar.\" \"Insanely similar,\" Eddie said with a grin. \"Insane, maybe. I'm waiting fornthe similar part.\" \"Well,\" Jane huffed, then smiled. \"We've both had our fair share of badnrelationships…\" \"The understatement of the year,\" Eddie grumbled under his breath. \"….And we both reacted to it in the same exact way,\" Jane said, her smilenfading slightly. \"We pretended to be someone we're not.\" Eddie shook hisnhead and took Jane into his arms. \"But look where we are, right?\" Eddie smiled, and traced her face lightlynwith his thumb. \"Uh-huh,\" Jane said, drowsily. Eddie leaned his face close to hers… RING-RING-A-LING!! Jane let out an exasperated groan, and Eddie slowly pulled his head back.nJane glared at her offending cell, grabbed it, and shook it in frustration.nShe shot Eddie a pained look, and brought it to her ear. JHello? L Hey, Jane! J Liz! Now…is NOT a good time! L Jane, I need to… Eddie snatched the phone. E Hello, Liz. Jane's gonna have to get back to ya! He snapped the cell shut, a small smirk on his face. He placed the cellndown, and looked over his shoulder at Jane. He tilted her back in annelaborate dip. \"Rewind,\" he grinned. (A few days later) \"Jane, WHAT are you DOING?\" Eddie exclaimed, plopping a bag of groceries onnthe counter. Jane was sitting at the table, her face fixed with intensenconcentration. She had a bag of mini- marshmallows, toothpicks, cardboard,nand newspaper clippings at hand. \"Creative streak, I guess,\" Jane said distractedly. She cut the cardboardninto two separate half-ovals. Eddie abandoned the groceries, and walkednover, stopping to look over Jane's shoulder. \"Uhh, Jane?\" Eddie started. \"Yeah.\" \"Do you remind if I repeat….what are you doing?\" he inquired. \"You'll see,\" Jane said mischievously. \"Now, can you go get me a drink?\"nEddie shrugged, perplexed, and went to get her a water, shaking his head. \"Hey, Jane,\" Eddie said. \"I decided I'm going to tell Diane about Dr.nTuro. Now that the most important person in my life knows, I don't see thenharm in anyone else knowing.\" \"Bad idea, Alden,\" Jane said, pausing from her work. \"You see the looknDiane gives me every time Dr. Charles is mentioned? I'm surprised I stillnhave my job. Now you? Seriously, Eddie. Keep quiet about it.\" She bit hernlip. \"I should know best.\" \"Jane…\" Eddie looked at the ceiling and sighed deeply. \"Done!\" Jane said triumphantly, sitting back in her chair. Eddie grabbednthe water and placed it by Jane's hand, and studied her masterpiece. Thentwo half-ovals were joined as what looked like two tombstones, and thenmarshmallows were bunched together as kind of a raised grave, thentoothpicks keeping them together. On the tombstones were two separatenpictures, one of Dr. Turo, the other of Dr. Charles. Pasted behind thenjoined tombstones was a picture of Jane and Eddie. Jane was gazing up atnEddie, while he looked down with equal fondness. \"So, um, what's the point of this?\" Eddie asked, after gently kissingnJane's cheek. Jane smiled up at him. \"Look,\" Jane pointed to the cardboard tombstones. \"Rest In Peace, Dr. James Turo,\" Eddie read. \"Rest In Peace, Dr. MarienCharles. May you advise the troubled hearts behind your identity forever.\"nEddie looked at Jane and let out a small chuckle. \"Jane?\" \"Yeah?\" \"You really need a hobby.\" \"Eddie?\" Jane and Eddie walked into work the next day, Eddie's arm slungnaround Jane's shoulder, his hand tightened around hers. Jane awkwardlynshook her hand free. \"Eddie, your palms are sweating like crazy!\" Eddienself-consciously wiped his palms on his pants and grinned sheepishly. \"Nerves,\" was his simple answer. \"Eddie! Jane! Meeting in five minutes!\" Diane called as she strode past.nJane nodded, but was suddenly bumped against Eddie. \"Jane! Uh, sorry!\" Ray Brown paused, and smiled the smile that once wonnJane's heart over, but did nothing now. \"Hey Eddie…can I talk to Jane ansec?\" Eddie nodded. \"Alone?\" Eddie then frowned. He didn't like Ray havingnmuch to do with Jane…he looked at Jane, who shrugged. \"Make this quick, Ray. We have a meeting in a few,\" Jane said. Eddiensqueezed her shoulder. \"I'm going to talk to Diane now, okay?\" he said. \"Get it over with.\" \"You want some moral support?\" Jane asked, concerned. \"Nah,\" Eddie shook his head. \"It's better than making myself look bad onnpublic television, right?\" \"Watch it,\" Jane warned, glaring at him. Eddie chuckled and walked off. \"What was that all about?\" Ray asked curiously. Jane dismissed the questionnwith a wave of her hand. \"Never mind. What did you need to talk to me about?\" Jane averted her eyesnfrom Ray's, which were boring into hers. Then, he said the one word Janenonce dreamed of, but now despised coming from his lips. \"Us.\" (Now we take a magical journey to Eddie Land) \"Uh, Diane?\" Eddie knocked on Diane's door. Diane looked up. \"Eddie, come on in.\" Eddie eased his way into the office. \"Diane, we need to talk….about this Dr. Turo guy.\" Diane raised an eyebrow. \"James Turo got to Eddie Alden as well?\" she said lightly. Eddie grinnednuneasily. \"Well, that's the thing,\" Eddie snapped his gum nervously. To heck with thenNicorettes. He needed a cigarette. \"You see, Diane, Dr. James Turo is EddienAlden. Or once was.\" \"Whoa, run that by me again,\" Diane said shortly. \"You…wrote…\" Eddiennodded. \"What is with you people?\" she exclaimed. \"Do you enjoy goingnbehind my back and doing this? Did Jane set you up to this?\" \"Hey, Jane didn't know!\" Eddie jumped to Jane's defense. \"Turo was pre-Dr.nCharles, Diane, so don't drag her into this!\" Diane shrugged. \"You have to admit, it sounds weird.\" Diane leaned forward eagerly. \"DoesnJane know?\" Eddie nodded. \"She, ah, figured it out by herself,\" Eddie said quickly. Diane leaned backnand smiled. \"This is PERFECT!\" Diane crowed. \"Can't you see it, Eddie?\" Eddie frowned. \"Um, see what, Diane?\" he said slowly. \"IT!\" Diane waved her hands. \"This is so, so great! Picture it,\" she tooknEddie's arm and pointed to an invisible bulletin. \"Dr. James Turo revealednas Eddie Alden, current boyfriend of Jane Goodale, also known as Dr. MarienCharles!\" \"Back up,\" Eddie frowned, not liking where this was heading. \"You wantnme…and Jane… to pose as the object of your latest 'get'?\" \"Well, yes,\" Diane said. \"If you want to put it that way.\" \"I'll have to think about it,\" Eddie tilted his head for a moment. \"NO!\" His voice clashed with Jane's down the hall. Freezing, Eddie stood innhis spot, before turning and bolting down the corridor. \"Eddie!\" Diane yelled after him. \"Jane!\" Ray called. \"Would you LISTEN to me?\" Diane and Ray chorused together. Eddie skidded tona halt, just in time to see Ray get pummeled with crumpled paper…again. \"Get it through your skull, Ray!\" Jane shouted. She whirled around. Eddienjumped to the side to avoid her. \"Jane?\" Eddie looked at her with confusion. \"Oh, Eddie!\" Jane let out a bark of laughter, half nervous, half relieved.n\"Hey, um, just taking care of business.\" Eddie glared at Ray, having nondoubt that the other man was behind this. \"Are we through with this soap opera?\" Diane tapped her foot impatiently.n\"Meeting should have been underway ten minutes ago.\" Jane, Eddie, and Raynlooked warily at each other, then at Diane. Eddie grabbed paperwork fromnhis desk, then walked Jane to her office. \"Look, Eddie, I don't need a bodyguard,\" Jane snapped irritably. \"I don'tnneed you leaping to protect me every. Single. Second.\" She enunciated eachnword with short tapping sounds of neatening her papers. \"Got it?\" shenpushed past a stunned Eddie, a small pang of guilt burrowing into hernheart. Why was she so snappish with him? He hadn't done anything than whatnshe hoped a man would. \"Jane,\" Eddie caught up in two long strides. \"Is this going to happen everyntime we have a run-in with Ray?\" Jane bit her lip and kept walking. \"Inthought you were over this, Jane. I thought—I thought we were in thisntogether. You know…team?\" they entered Diane's office, and it seemed allneyes were on them. Lifting her chin, Jane took her usual spot and readiednher pen. Eddie sat down with a sigh, and stretched his arms over the couch. \"Are we settled?\" Diane asked coolly. Ray glanced over at Jane and Eddie,nwho nodded. \"Let's get this show on the road,\" Ray said smoothly. \"First off,\" Diane began. \"We have a promotion in order.\" Eddie looked upncuriously, Jane looked puzzled, and Ray looked almost expectant. Anpromotion? Now this was big news. \"Two, actually.\" This caused a buzz ofnsurprise. Two promotions? \"Hm,\" Jane murmured thoughtfully, and found herself leaning into Eddie, whonin turn, kissed her head. Unspoken apologies had been said. \"Jane,\" Diane looked directly at her. \"Since your Dr. Charles columns,nyou've shown a skill for writing. Congratulations, you are our new writer.\"nJane frowned. If she was the writer, where would that leave Eddie? \"Eddie,nconsidering this leaves you minus a title,\" she grinned. \"You will now benthe executive producer.\" \"Hey!\" Ray protested. \"Diane…\" \"Yes, Ray? You have a problem?\" Diane asked lightly. \"Actually, yes,\" Ray said. \"Where does that leave me?\" \"Honestly, Ray,\" Diane looked miffed. \"You may be a big name is Washington,nbut Eddie has proven himself over a long period of time. He deserves this.\" \"Diane…\" Eddie began slowly. \"Why did you suddenly spring this on us?\"nDiane smiled brightly….too brightly for Eddie's taste. \"Eddie, have you ever doubted my judgment, my choices? Have I ever betrayednyou, steered you wrong?\" Eddie shot a discreet look at Ray, clearlynthinking about what Ray did to Jane…with Diane. Betrayal…the word struck anchord in Eddie's mind. Of course. Eddie looked up. \"Diane…would this, in any way, shape, size, or form, have anything to donwith two specific people, both real yet fake at the same time?\" Eddie keptnhis voice natural and calm, waiting patiently for Diane's response. Henreceived none. Diane Roberts was at a loss for words.

It was a huge day fornthe staff at the Diane Roberts Show, the NYC renown guy critic Dr. MarienCharles was finally going to speak out. Despite the fact that I'm a guy,nmaking me the target for her male-bashing, I was excited. Excited, but hey,nI'm Eddie Alden. I don't show my feelings often. I snuck a quick peek at Jane, whose head was held high, but she'dnlost her coloring. This must be a big day for her as well, consideringnshe's practically a Dr. Charles disciple. I sighed to myself. This Dr.nCharles really packed it in on Jane. How I put up with her those few monthsnas a roommate is beyond me. Bull this and Cow that. Men are this and mennare that. I groaned inwardly. Ray's voice peeped into my headphone,nannouncing that the website already had 20,000 hits. I grinned andnmuttered, \"Holy Cow.\" I adjusted my headset, and waited for the voice of Dr. Charles. Outnof the corner of my eye, I saw Jane back up, and sneak off and out of thenstudio. I shook my head. If she was going to watch the feed on TV, she knewnthere was one right here. But Jane…Jane's a strange one. When I turned my attention back to the stage, I heard Ray's voicengrumbling something about not getting through to Dr. Charles. Not good. Wenhad thousands of fans watching, and I could tell that things wouldn't benpretty if we didn't get the feed. Suddenly, a blur whipped past, pausing innfront of me. Jane stood on tip-toe to speak into my headset. \"She's here,\"nJane said hurriedly. \"She wants to go on.\" A ripple of shock spread through the staff, but took it in stride. Diane,never the ad-libber, covered smoothly, introducing Dr. Charles. So? Inglanced around. Where was she? My gaze fell to Jane, who was being powderednup. She swatted the make-up artists hands away, and made her way to thenstage. No. my mind raced. This is not happening…Jane can't..where's…Inwatched Jane speak briefly to Diane, something about making Dr. Charles up.nShaking my head, I pulled off the headset and stalked out. The brisk air was like a slap to the face, much like what had just playednbefore me had. I jammed my hands into my pockets, ducking into a cab.n~What're you hiding~ I asked her simply the previous morning, after wakingnup to her in my arms. She blatantly told me she wasn't hiding anything. Anlie. Anything I'd ever had with her, a lie. Liz not knowing anything, anlie. I peered out the window, and was shocked to see Jane running after thencab, yelling something. I looked away and muttered to the driver to keep going. Was she crazy? Shenwas trying to race a taxi cab! The cab slowed at a red light, and Janenleapt in front it. She WAS insane! She was gonna get herself killed! Thendriver yelled at her to get out of the way, but she persisted. Sighing, Inopened the door and got out. She yelled my name, sounding like the happiestnperson alive I was dead silent, shutting the door. \" whatcha see is what ya get, huh?\"nJane nodded. \"Minus a few gray hairs and a PhD, yeah. Look, Eddie, I shoulda told you…\" \"you shoulda told me a lot of things, \"I replied slowly.I barely listenednto her ramble on and on, which I summed up to be an apology. She saidnsomething about finding it again, and that she did. I kept my eyes on hernto show I was paying attention. Was she actually saying she loved me? \"Aren't you going to say anything?\" she asked, almost plaintively. I shooknmy head. \"No,\" I said quietly. Jane looked like a little kid who was just told thatnSanta didn't exist. She looked accepting though, like she'd expect thatncoming. I slowly advanced on her, pulling her into the kiss I'd dreamed ofnfor months.

Too much had just happened in what was supposed to be the most incredible five minutes of her entire life. Her nerves were on the fritz and her mind wouldn't shut up, no matter what she did. She paced back and forth in her office, her fingers absently playing with the fringe of her shirt and the fingernails of her other hand were being gnawed away by her teeth. 'How could she?' Her mind mulled over the very thought of it. 'Of all the people…' She paused her pacing and strode hastily to her desk, picking up the phone. \"Get Eddie down here!' She commanded, her teeth grinding in the back of her jaw. There was a moment of angry silence before it climaxed to infuriation. \"What do you mean he's gone?! Well, where the fuck did he go?! Well…find him and bring him back! And tell him he's fired!\" With that, she slammed the phone down and went on with her pacing, threatening to create a dip in the floor. \"What do I pay these people for?!\" She screamed out to herself, throwing her arms violently up into the air as if to ask the person on the floor above her. She went back to gnawing on her fingernails before she got another idea. Breaking her pace again, she went back to her desk and picked up the phone again. \"Have you lost count on all of them?\" She said with forced kindness through clenched teeth. \"Well, who do you still have?\" \"Good, tell him to get his ass down to my office!\" She screamed before slamming down the phone again, returning to her constant ambling across the floor in front of her desk, making sawdust with her high heels. *MOO* \"How's Diane doing?\" Nina asked, looking up from a stack of papers with a wondrous glance. Ray sighed in pity of himself and stuck up his hand as if to wave her away like an annoying fly. \"She's probably shitting bricks,\" Then he added sarcastically, \"thanks for asking.\" He didn't break his confidence-sucking stride until he approached the outside of Diane's closed office door. He waited as he watched her through the window, trying to mentally ready himself for the demon that lay inside. Watching her pace back and forth, back and forth inside her office reminded Ray of a crazed mother lion he had seen pacing back and forth in a small cage at the zoo one time. They had to put the lion down a week later. Taking a deep breath to build up the self-assurance he was already drowning in anyway, Ray reluctantly opened the door and stepped inside, quietly closing it behind him. As he took a breath to say something there was a manicured finger inches away from his nose and a pair of wide, enraged eyes staring him in the face. \"Before you say ANYTHING, Ray Brown, I want you to answer me ONE question.\" Diane seemed more suitable to be wearing a camouflaged bucket on her head and getting responses like \"SIR, YES SIR!\" \"Sure Dee.\" Ray answered meekly. \"How in the world could she do that to me?!\" Diane backed off of him, letting him step away from the door. \"I-I don't know Dee,\" Ray tried as he cleared his throat and smoothed down his shirt. \"I mean, of all the people in my studio! At the most IMPORTANT of all times!\" Her body was tense as she slammed her fingers against the side of her head to illustrate her point. \"What was she THINKING?!\" Ray raised his hands in surrender. \"DO you even REALIZE how CLOSE I was to making this show the BEST of the BEST?!\" She returned to her pacing, the only thing that seemed to keep her from punching through the walls. \"Where are my cigarettes?\" She began opening and slamming the drawers in her desk, shoving things out of the way in desperation. \"I thought you stopped smoking.\" Ray commented, feeling it safe to get a couple more steps away from the door. \"Then I picked a bad time to stop!\" Diane threw up her arms before shoving them down into the top drawer of her desk and pulling out a packet of half-gone cigarettes and a lighter. She hastily pounded one out onto the desk and lit it, taking a long puff, so long that Ray was almost afraid she might collapse due to lack of oxygen. Suddenly, her shoulders slumped and she threw herself back into her chair, crossing her arms over her chest like a disgruntled child, but careful not to catch her clothes on fire. \"I was THIS CLOSE, Ray! THIS god damn CLOSE!\" She held her fingers up in front of her face, her thumb and pointer finger about half an inch apart. \"I HAD the WORLD! I had the ULTIMATE UNGETTABLE GET!\" She took another long puff, her face squeezing into an awkward pucker. Ray raised an eyebrow in concern and came cautiously forward. \"Dee?\" He asked, concerned with the way her face was tightened. She looked up at him with a small whimper before looking down and tightening her face in that awkward way again. It was almost as if she was trying to contort her face into a point. \"A-are you…\" he was afraid to ask, \"crying?\" \"What does it look like I'm doing?!\" Diane screamed at him. He held back his first thought and said the next that came to mind. \"Aren't there suppose to be…you know…tears?\" He tentatively came forward again. \"Oh for God's sake Ray! I've had too many plastic surgeries! I can't cry!\" Ray had to hold down the urge to burst out with laughter. \"I was going to be right up there with Montel and Ricky Lake!\" She kept blubbering on. \"Do have any idea how many people were watching my show at that very moment?\" Ray shook his head. \"A LOT!\" She raised her hand to wipe away nonexistent tears. Ray smiled in kind. \"I was suppose to have Dr. MARIE CHARLES! The greatest psychologist of the twenty-first century!\" Diane hastily stubbed out her still-good cigarette and reached into the pack for a new one. \"I know,\" Ray said comfortingly, now placed strategically behind Diane giving her tightrope-tense shoulders a gentle massage. \"Then for Jane to stand up and say it was all a hoax, that Dr. Charles never existed in the first place!\" She seemed so flustered that she couldn't think of what Jane's cause for her actions were. \"I know,\" Ray said again, sighing in pity to himself again. \"And then! And then!\" Diane raised a shaky finger haphazardly in Ray's direction, and he immediately froze. Diane's eye twitched as she turned in her seat to face Ray, balanced on her knees and her finger poking into his breastbone. \"What did she mean by \"Ray's not the last person you're ever going to love\"?\" \"Hmm? What was THAT about Ray? Would you like to fill me in on a little something?\" There was a fire behind her eyes that threatened him to lie. \"I-I-I…I…\" He stuttered, stepping away from the chair as she followed him, her finger still against his breastbone and the fire blazing in her eyes. He backed away, one of his hands posed defensively in front of him while the other searched wildly behind him for anything solid. \"You wouldn't happen to be keeping any secrets from me, would you?\" She spat. If she only had a head full of snakes, she could have turned him to stone right there on the spot. \"N-Now Diane…\" But he was suddenly cut off as his hand found the doorknob and he immediately twisted it unlocked. The door swung open behind him and he went crashing onto his back in the middle of the hallway, right in front of everyone. He sat up on his elbows as Diane disappeared into her office, the door still open. He rubbed at his aching breastbone, afraid to move. Suddenly, a blue thing flew through the air and landed on his face. He pulled it away, recognizing it as the silk shirt Jane had bought him on the street, the one he had later given to Diane after they had gotten back together. \"I want you out of here Ray!\" Diane came back to the door, holding onto the doorframe and looking down at him as if he were a piece of crud. \"But Dee!-\" He began to protest, pushing himself up from the floor. \"Let me put it in English,\" She generously formed her lips around the words. \"YOU ARE FIRED!\" Ray turned away from her, toward all the faces who had their jaws cradled on the carpet. He sucked in his breath and stuck out his chest, determined to leave with what little decency he had left. \"And by the way!\" Diane called after him as he pushed through the crowd of co-workers. \"The sex SUCKED!\" And with that, the Old-Cow-Turned-New got a new bell and an Old-Bull-Made-Hamburger became yesterday's dinner… THE END I hope this was as fun to read as it was to write!!! :) There will always be more, so keep your grass fresh and hide your footballs!

Sure he'd been all smiles when all of yetikind had walked down the mountain and introduced themselves to the humans, but Migo was beginning to suspect that was more of a diplomatic show on Percy's part rather than a reflection of his actual feelings, considering how after all the photos had been taken and all the fanfare over with he'd slipped out of sight without a word and Migo hadn't had a moment with him since. Well, not a moment alone anyway. Sure Percy made the trip up the mountain almost every day to hang out for a few to several hours, but never one-on-one with him; always with a big group. He'd introduce yetikind to all sorts of cool concepts and inventions. A process made a lot easier since he'd figured out how to communicate with them verbally. Something about Yiddish, or Yettish? Anyway who was Migo to yank him away from all that to selfishly demand his undivided attention? I mean, he'd considered it a couple times, but quickly swatted away the notion like it was a yak fly. Instead he settled for trying to get past the human's peripheral vision and into his actual line of sight as often as he could amongst the crowd that inevitably formed around the human, one time actually managing to catch his eye, but only for the briefest of seconds, as Percy looked away almost immediately after making eye-contact and made sure to keep his attention focused anywhere but Migo's direction while teaching everyone how to use this thing called a \"zip line\". Okay, so now he knew it wasn't just in his head: Percy was definitely avoiding him. And Migo needed to find out why, so he could fix it. Luckily for him the perfect opportunity presented itself just the next day when some bad weather rolled in an hour or so after Percy had finished his climb up. Migo found him in the observatory, watching the blizzard taking place just outside, back facing him. \"Hey, uh, you doing okay?\" He saw the human visibly stiffen, but just the slightest bit, then deliberately relax. \"Well of course I am; it's out there and I'm in here.\" Percy said with artificial nonchalance. \"Why wouldn't I be?\" He finished without turning to face him, back still to the yeti. Migo ventured a couple steps closer as he went for the throat. \"Well, it's just I've kinda been getting the feeling that you've been avoiding me?\" He was expecting to be met with excuses, or flat-out being laughed at and told he was just being paranoid, not with the almost whispered words he got in response. \"You abandoned me.\" Percy said as he finally turned around to face Migo. \"I thought- I thought I was going to die.\" His voice broke on the last word. \"I thought you cared, but I was wrong.\" He turned away so the yeti wouldn't see the pools of tears forming in his eyes, threatening to fall at any moment. \"What, no! Of course I do.\" Migo replied, lurching forward and reaching out to comfort his friend, but pulling back at the last second—his outstretched fingers curling in on themselves—knowing his touch probably wouldn't be appreciated at the moment. \"Then why did you literally hand me over to the stone guy, who put me in an ice cage?\" Percy asked miserably, hugging himself and clutching his jacket tightly in his hands in an unconscious effort to reaffirm it was really there. That gave the yeti pause, remembering that moment of weakness when he'd lied to the whole village in an effort to keep them safe, all the while putting a helpless Percy in harm's way in the process. \"... I made a mistake.\" Migo began, gaze lowering to the floor momentarily. \"I was convinced you were something you weren't and it was wrong of me to have given you up. I'm so sorry I ever put you in danger, and I'd give up my horns just to be able to go back and do things differently.\" \"... You really mean that?\" Percy unfurled enough to turn around and look Migo in the eyes, allowing the yeti to see the moisture gathered on the other's small eyelashes, causing his heart to clench inside his chest. \"Of course I do; I'd never let anything hurt you.\" He reached out to lift the human's chin with a single finger almost the size of his whole head. \"I'll protect you from anything that threatens to hurt you.\" He said with feeling in every word, bringing out of Percy a small, but genuine smile. Which soon turned into a smirk. \"Just like I did with you?\" Migo couldn't keep a chuckle from escaping at that. \"Yeah, but maybe with a little bit less stabbing. And falling face first into the snow, unconscious.\" That brought out a good chuckle in return, which devolved into some teeth chattering accompanied by some slight shivering, causing Migo's brows to draw. \"Are you cold?\" \"Well of course I am. Have you ever heard of warm snow? Or ice for that matter?\" Percy gestured around at the veritable ice cube they were currently standing inside of. \"What about the heat generator in your jacket?\" Migo asks, remembering having heard about it. \"Got busted in the skeeball incident this morning.\" Percy replies easily, then worries his lip as he turns his head to eye the weather through the clear ice wall giving them a safe look into the outside. \"I just hope this blizzard lets up soon; I can usually only handle staying up here a few hours, and that's with this thing working.\" He taps his chest a couple times, causing a small spring to pop out of his jacket. Which he then pulls out the rest of the way and chucks behind himself. \"And the weather being calm.\" He had a good point, Migo thought. Too much longer up here and Percy would no doubt become a popsicle, just like when he'd first tried to take the human up the mountain. Hmm, he tried to think of a solution when one suddenly popped right into his head. \"Is the cold threatening to hurt you?\" He asked with just the hint of a conspiratorial smile. \"Come again?\" Percy asked, rightly confused. \"Is the cold threatening to hurt you?\" The yeti repeated, as if it were something completely normal to say. \"Um, yes I guess. If you want to put it that way.\" He mumbled the last bit bemusedly. \"Then I guess that means I have to protect you from it.\" Migo affects a strange voice and straightens up to his full height, putting puts his fists on his hips much in the same way a superhero would. \"What? How?\" Percy asks, now turning to once again fully face his friend. \" I'm warm, aren't I?\" Migo says with a self-satisfied smirk. Percy merely raises an eyebrow in response. A/N Wasn't Smallfoot such a good movie? I totally had to write a fic about it, and even started typing away on the drive home, lol.[Chapter 2] A/N: Thank you to everyone who read and/or left a review! I wasn't expecting more than like 2 or 3 views and nothing else, so what a great confidence boost this had been. As your reward, here is chapter 2! \"This should help.\" Migo says as he grabs a potted plant off the nightstand. \"Where did you get that?\" Percy asks from his position cradled in the crook of Migo's warm, furry arm. \"Meechee brought it the other day. She said it was good for humans. Makes it easier to breathe when you're higher up than usual.\" He says, holding it up for Percy to take. \"Oh yeah, just like 'A Wrinkle in Time'. Smart one, that Meechee.\" He says as he accepts it, then pulls it to his chest to cuddle like a teddy bear, taking a good inhale of the fresh oxygen it provided all the while. \"Yeah,\" Migo responds to the last sentence with a hint of confusion coloring his voice, not knowing what that other thing was. \"And I made a fire to make the room a little bit warmer at least. Even made it self-loading.\" He gestures at a hearth on wheels only to note he forgot to fill the feed tube with logs. \"Oh, wait here just a minute.\" He says as he sets Percy down on his bed to load it. It only takes a minute or two, but when he turns back around he sees Percy shivering and looking just the slightest bit blue. Migo was then struck by the reality of just how fragile this human was. Even his bed turned Percy's skin to ice. Then again, his bed was kind of a rock , so that made enough sense. But that just solidified how in need of Migo's body heat Percy really was at the moment because of the storm, which made the temperature even lower than normal—it seeming a little chilly even to Migo. \"Woah woah, sorry about that.\" He said before quickly scooping up the tiny human once again, then rolling the fire closer before plopping down on the bed himself and lying down so Percy could sleep on his big chest. \"How are you so warm ?\" The red-vested one says as he practically burrows into Migo's fur, blowing a raspberry when some got in his mouth, but then shivering once again. Then Migo realized that Percy's back was still exposed to the cold, so he brought up his hands and covered the human's entire body with them easily, cocooning him in warmth. Then he lifted the top of one just enough so he could speak to Percy. \"Just one of the perks of being a yeti, I guess. How you doin' in there?\" \"I feel like a gooey, toasty marshmallow.\" Percy said as he practically melted against him, no longer shivering. \"Uh... is that a good thing?\" Migo asked, sincerely hoping it was. Percy couldn't help but chuckle at his friend's confusion (and decide he definitely had to introduce him to s'mores at some point). \"Yes, it means I am nice and warm now, thanks to you.\" He said through a smile, but his mirth slipped away when he remembered the inclement weather just outside which even made this necessary. \"I just hope the blizzard doesn't stick around for too long.\" Migo noticed the worried look in his small friend's eyes and was quick to reassure him. \"Don't worry; I won't let you go until this storm passes. No matter how long it takes.\" Percy looked up at his friend, touched by his words. Then a slightly mischievous look overtook the human's features. \"Or until I need to pee.\" \"Or until you need to pee.\" Migo amended, smiling co-conspiratorially. \"But then it's back to bed with you, mister!\" He finished with a mock serious voice, causing both of them to fall into a small giggling fit. \"Hey, next time you come up the mountain would you like me to show you how to snow slide?\" He asked when his laughter had died down. \"Hmm, sounds interesting. What is it?\" \"It's when you get a flat rock big enough to stand on and use it to slide across the top of the snow, sometimes doing cool flips and tricks and stuff.\" \"Oh, I already know how to do that. Except we call it snow boarding. And we don't use rocks. Plus we need special shoes.\" Migo thought it interesting how similar yet different their two kinds were. \"In that case you want to have a race sometime? We can see which is faster: snow boarding , or snow sliding .\" \"Sounds like a great time! I can hardly wait to make you eat my dust.\" Percy said as he got into a more comfortable position, now on his side, cuddling the potted plant. \"Yeah, except I don't think you'll be doing that because you'll be too busy eating mine.\" Migo shot back, then saw his small friend let out a big yawn and close his eyes. \"Hey, have a nice nap, okay? He said as he put his hand back down, sealing in the warmth. All he got in reply to that was some light snoring, which made him chuckle. He was glad they were friends again. A/N: Worry not, for this is not the end! I have at least one more chapter planned.[Chapter 3] A/N: Thank you all for an awesome response to this story! Here is your reward of another chapter. Enjoy! \"Migo!\" Meechee shouts upon coming to a screeching halt just inside Migo's room, completely covered in snow, which she then shook off in a way quite reminiscent of a dog, small ice crystals flying in every direction. \"You gotta help me! Percy's missing; I checked all over for him, but I couldn't find him anywhere. I know he came up before the storm blew in though!\" She then clutched the hair on the sides of her head and began to pace. \"Oh, what if he's buried somewhere, or he got crushed, or maybe he's even-\" \"Sleeping?\" Migo cut in, and upon seeing Meechee's questioning look he lifted one hand slightly to reveal the head of one sleeping human. \"Aww,\" Meechee began as she walked over to get a closer look \"He's so cute~\" \"I'll do you a favor and not tell him you said that.\" Migo chuckled good-naturedly. \"Oh, don't worry about that; I'll just tell him it's a mistranslation of the word adorable ~\" she cooed as she got close enough to see his details better. But just then the human started to shiver and she pulled back so Migo could re-cover him. \"Wow, I guess you're kinda stuck here until the storm blows over too, huh?\" She asked, seeing how just a few seconds of being exposed to the air caused the tiny human discomfort. \"Yeah pretty much, but I was prepared for that.\" Migo shrugged lightly so as not to disturb Percy. \"Aww, that's so sweet. How about I help out?\" She takes a quick look around, eventually spotting the crackling fire. \"Would you like me to stoke the fire?\" She said, gesturing wide with both arms—like a gameshow assistant putting a prize on display—as she stood right next to it. \"Thanks, but I already have it on automatic.\" She turns her attention to it in time to see a new log roll into place and start the fire up stronger again, revitalizing the flames with fresh fuel. \"Oh,\" she said, surprised. \"alright, well would you like some company?\" \"Yeah, that'd be great actually; I'm not sleepy, but he sure is.\" He says, gesturing with his face towards where his small friend was napping away on his chest, currently hidden from sight beneath his large hands. \"Alrighty then.\" She says, grabbing a chair to put next to the bed and then settling down in it. She's silent for several seconds, looking like she wants to say something, but not knowing if she should. Before Migo can ask what's on her mind though, she speaks up. \"So, I take it you two talked?\" \"Huh?\" Migo says, caught off-guard. \"What are- what do you- I mean, how...? He trailed off, not knowing how to finish. \"I could tell he was upset about something during his visits—even though he hid it pretty well—, so one time when just the two of us were hanging out together I let him know that if he had anything he wanted to get off his chest I was a really good listener, and he told me what was up, and wondered what he should do because of the whole 'harboring thoughts of discontentment with your friendship because of the sense of betrayal he still felt from during your deception of the village that you thought was necessary at the time, when you threw him to the veritable wolves to his doom in an icy prison while he was dying of elevation sickness.'\" She said in one breath and in a manner as if she were discussing the weather. \"I told him you guys should talk, but only when he was ready.\" Migo blinked in response. \"Oh, you two hang out together, huh?\" \"Yeah, we're pals.\" She said, swinging her legs happily. \"Well, I guess I have you to thank that he actually talked about it at all because I have the feeling he would've dodged the subject until he was blue in the face if it wasn't for your help.\" Meechee waves him off. \"What are friends for?\" They talk for a few hours, Meechee catching Migo up on all the cool human things Percy has been relaying to her during his visits, as well as whatever else came up, when she noticed the temperature rise. She got up from her chair to peer out a window. \"Hey, it looks like the storm finally cleared.\" She called back to her soon-to-no-longer-be-burdened friend. \"Oh nice.\" That meant that Percy wasn't in danger of freezing if Migo removed his hands anymore. Just to be sure though, he uncovered his small friend slowly, checking to make sure he didn't suddenly start shivering. Soon as he had him uncovered fully Migo heard a muffled high-pitched squealing noise coming from the side and turned his head to see Meechee covering her mouth. At a questioning raise of one of his eyebrows she lowered her hands and explained \"He's so adorable right now, I think I'm gonna die.\" \"What? I wanna see.\" Migo cranes his neck but he can only see the top of Percy's head. He strains his neck a bit more, but eventually gives it up as a lost cause. \"No fair; I can't see, and I can't get up without waking him.\" He practically pouts. \"Hmm, I have an idea.\" Meechee says after a few moments of thought. \"Yeah?\" Migo asks, hopeful. \"Yeah, he showed me how to capture still images of real life—called 'pictures'—that you can treasure forever with that little device he carries around with him all the time.\" \"What? That's awesome. How does it even do that?\" He asks, excited and curious. \"It's complicated; I don't think even he knows exactly how it works. Just how to operate it.\" She says as she gets closer and tries to find the little rectangle visually, eventually spotting it barely peaking out the top of the small human's vest pocket. \"Aha!\" She quietly cheered so as not to wake him. \"Now if I can just get to it...\" she takes a quick look around the room for something she can use to get it out without disturbing the sleeping smallfoot, soon spotting a pair of tweezers, usually used for removing the occasional ice-splinter, but perfect for the task at hand. She then uses it to remove the phone with nothing more than some light sleep-mumbling in response from Percy. Sighing in relief when he doesn't wake up, she turns the phone on, aims it, and takes a picture. \"Okay here, look.\" She says as she shoves it in Migo's face. Who then starts squealing upon seeing his tiny friend curled around the potted plant (still clutching it like a teddy bear), hair all mussed up from him moving around in his sleep, and mouth partially open with a little bit of drool hanging out. \"Aww, he's so adorable!\" He squeal-whispers. \"I know!\" Meechee replies in kind. \"Ooh, let's take some more!\" The two yeti then spend the next several minutes using different props to take more pictures, some selfies including all three of them after accidentally tapping the front-facing camera. After they're finished with their impromptu photoshoot they review the pictures, scrolling through them one at a time, seeing one taken with Migo holding a couple fingers up behind Percy's head to make him look like he had yak horns, placing fluff in front of his face and angling the camera so it looked like he had a big white beard, completely surrounding him with small trinkets, Migo posing like he was an irate bear about to strike, Meechee pretending like she was trying to braid Percy's hair but being confused as to how since it was so short, and so on until eventually reaching the final one they took. \"Well, that's all of them.\" Meechee informed, about to lock the phone. \"Wait,\" Migo said before Meechee pressed the button, having spotted something odd. \"can you zoom in? It almost looks like his eyes are-\" \"Excuse me,\" a squeaky voice interrupts. \"AAaahh!\" Both yeti scream in unison. A/N: Hope you enjoyed that, and don't worry; we'll totally get to see their snow race if I can find the time. ","Summary":" For some reason Migo couldn't get the feeling out of his head that Percy had been avoiding him for "},{"Movie":"Smallfoot","Title":"A Family Matter","Author":"iam57311","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13192585","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: Hello, people on the Internet! Welcome to the first chapter of my first fanfiction (written in 2019)! It super short and not that well written, but who cares! This is just something I thought up in my head the day after I got into the Smallfoot fandom. Like the movie, it will be full of references, clichés, and original music (I never said any of it would be good, just warning you!). Be warned, I'm going to screw up in writing the characters badly, so bare with me! I don't own the movie Smallfoot or any of it's characters, except for one original character. Better than it sounds. Cover art done by me. Word count: 1,143 An awakening before the light of the \"Great Glowing Sky Snail\", only this time, without the sound of the gong. It had been a few years since the ringing of the gong was discovered pointless anyway. A lot has changed throughout those years, actually. No longer does everyone have to feed the \"Great Mountain Mammoths\" everyday. These pointless jobs and tasks are no longer done. Now, there are much better jobs for the Yetis: more of them are now educating the children with the world, instead of the \"Rules Written in Stone\" (of course there's still rules, though), there are more Healers than just 1-3 (something that would've been extremely helpful for the past... ever!), plus many more, more important jobs. There are still many Yetis with their respective jobs, at the same time as Yetis who don't need to work as much and get more time with their family and friends. Although, some are unhappy now that what they've known all their lives is basically pointless and they have a lesser purpose than they used to have. A good example of this the Stonekeeper. He is still the leader of the Yetis, yes, just not the same. It's taken a lot of weight off his shoulders (literally) now that he doesn't have to keep secrets from everyone he loves and cares about and wear his robe made of the \"Rules Written in Stone\" every single day. It's just, he feels like he has less of purpose to everyone. The only reason his name is still Stonekeeper is because all that have called him by his real name are either long gone or have forgotten it, like him… He would sometimes wake up a few minutes before the sunrise, now it's just a habit. The sky still mostly dark as always. He sat up looking at some stone drawings across his room, some old, some new. Multiple of them were of his children throughout the stages of their lives, the newer ones of them and their mates. This made him happy. He looked at a more recent family portrait. It was of his son, Thorp, and his mate, Fayre; his daughter, Meechee, and her mate, Migo; his new brother-in-law, Dorgle, and him on the left. Perfection. Of course, he just had to look at two of his old family portraits that only brought him sadness and grief. Is there even a purpose to waking up anymore? He thought. He then remembered what the purpose of the day was. At least for today. He got out of bed. He took care of his morning, including individually tying and braiding a lot of his hair (yikes!), then returned to his room as it was still dark-ish. He sat on a chair made of ice near his windowsill, watching and waiting for the sun to rise. No point in going back to sleep now. He probably sat in that chair for a little over five minutes before he fell back to sleep on the spot. He quickly woke back up, just to fall asleep again. He was awoken about three minutes later by the sound of Migo singing the town awake. It sounded like he sang something about the rising of the \"Great Glowing Sky Snail\". He looked up: Migo was right. The \"Great Glowing Sky Snail\" was rising slowly and beautifully. It helped that Migo was with everyone else and their friends. This made him forget about his earlier feelings and just be happy. I guess I'll go join them. Stonekeeper walked out of his room, grabbing his purple turtle staff on the way out. He got his mammoth and rode out on it, which made him look and feel important. They walked towards the group, exchanging Good Morning's with the villagers as he passed by them. He's close enough now to hear better what they're singing about: Meechee: ...I have a feeling inside my bones, it's gonna be a fantastic day, Migo: Here with my family and friends, sharing experiences 'long the way Group: Wake up on this lovely morning, we're probably gonna sing this all day long Don't act like you don't love it, it's practically your favorite so-o-ong Oh hey oh, oh oh oh oo oh oh, oh oh oo woah ha ho ha ho Oh oh oh oo oh oh oo oh oh, oh oh oo woah ha ho ho ho Oh, ha ho, It's practically your favorite so-o-ong! Fleem: Ye-ah, da, da da da, da da-a da da… *looks at everyone, gets weird looks in return* Is the song over? Ah well. *walks away, whistling song* Stonekeeper lightly chuckled. Best way to start the morning, he thought, and now I kind of wish I was part of it... Meechee spotted Stonekeeper from a short distance. She started to him. \"Good Morning, Daddy!\" She stretched out her arms. Stonekeeper got off his mammoth. He returned the hug, picking her up slightly and spinning her around a bit like he did to her when she was younger. \"Good Morning, Meechee.\" He looked to where Meechee was standing earlier. \"Where's your brother?\" he asked. \"I could swear I just saw him.\" Meechee looked behind her. She saw Migo, who was approaching, and behind him was Dorgle, Gwangi, and Kolka. She looked again to see if he was there. Nothing. Looked around. Nothing there either. \"No, I don't see him or Fayre around. He must have left or something,\" she replied with a shrug. Stonekeeper shrugged. \"Oh well, then. I guess I'll talk to him later on.\" He saw Migo walk up closer to Meechee and hold her hand. A smile showed on his face. A hint of jealousy but not much of it. \"So, how have you two been?\" \"Great!\" They both said, a large grin across their faces. Dorgle stood beside his son and patted him on his arm, a grin on his face too. They know something I don't, Stonekeeper thought. He gave a slight chuckle anyway. \"Alright then. I'm going to patrol the village until that thing you needed me for comes up.\" He got back on his mammoth. \"By the way, Stonekeeper,\" Migo started, \"You should join us tomorrow morning.\" He, along with everyone else, had been asking him for a while now. He hasn't joined them in a few months, and they were starting to get worried. They all hoped he would say yes this time. \"Sure,\" Stonekeeper said. Now I know you're all up to something, he thought. It still brought a smile to his face. \"See you all soon.\" The group waved back, some said Bye. Stonekeeper and his mammoth then walked off. Once he was at a distance, Meechee looked at Migo with an excited expression on her face. \"I can't wait to tell him!\" She jumped up and down slightly. Migo chuckled. \"I know.\" Author's Note: So that was it. Depending on how busy I am with all the projects I have due by Friday, I might be able to get Chapter 2 out soon. I was able to write this one in three days… I can't promise that'll happen again. It might, though (this Canadian weather will probably help!) If you haven't noticed, I added a reference to the 2016 Dreamworks movie, Trolls (which is my longest lasting fandom, so why not?). The original song is something I came up with to calm down my baby brother. That part with Fleem, my sister helped me come up with. In this way, they made this chapter less boring.[Chapter 2] Author's Note: Here's Chapter 2. I was able to write this chapter in five days instead of three, which is still okay I guess. This is another short chapter, by the way. I don't own the movie Smallfoot or any of it's characters, except for one original character. That reminds me, I need to use Fayre more. She's mentioned 2% more here than in the last chapter only, that's what it feels like. I'll try to use her more in Chapter 5. The funny thing is, though, I haven't figured out a final design for her character. This means she's entirely made up to the reader's imagination! Don't worry, no songs or references in this one! *: Basically how I feel when I walk into class everyday. Word count: 1,073 The Stonekeeper had been patrolling the Village for a little over half an hour by now. He really hoped that something would happen, that he would need to use his leader skills again… but, nothing. Just like any other day. Not suspiciously, but truly normal. Most were finishing up with cleaning up their houses for the morning. Some parents were watching over the children as the played, having a whole other day without school ahead of them. Some were busy managing their booths within the market, others were closing up shop for the day. A group of older teenagers could be seen walking and talking about school and life. This is the basic Saturday in the Yeti Village. The boring ol' simple life with a little less ridiculous rules and regulations to it. With the exception to a majority of the Villagers going down the mountain to visit the \"Smallfoot\" basically everyday for multiple hours. This being one of those days. He walked by his \"Ice Palace\". He looked at the door. Maybe I can go back to bed… \"Stonekeeper!\" Finally. Someone needed him. He didn't even care what it was that he was needed for. He looked down to see a young child, probably around eight or ten years old. She was with a group of young children like her. He got off his mammoth. \"What is it that you need, Soozie?\" He asked in a calm tone. \"Well,\" she began, putting her hands together, \" I was wondering if-\" \"Do you wanna come see the Smallfoot today?\" Another child interrupted. They all looked up at him with their big eyes hopefully. \"You never come, and the Smallfoots would love to see you again!\" Stonekeeper felt terrible. They had to ask today… He sighed. He knew he would have to tell them… again. He truly felt awful. \"I apologize, really. But, I have plans for today, and can't make it. I'll come tomorrow, I promise.\" He usually loathes having to say this to the children because his \"plans\" are really just taking a three hour nap to get the rest he can never get at night, then circling the Village while thinking of all the things in life that give him slight depression. This time, though, he felt bad and really meant it when he said he had plans. \"B-But you said that, like, twenty hundred times already!\" This made him chuckle. He just loves it when children exaggerate numbers. \" Yes,\" he admitted, \"but whenever I mentioned the words \"I promise\", didn't I go anyways?\" This much was true. Even though it would now take him longer to get down the mountain, if he made a promise to go down that mountain, then he would. And since it was not as often that he would go with everyone, the \"Smallfoot\" were interested in him when he did come. And he sometimes enjoys the attention, so it works out for everyone. \"Hmm, yeah, I guess you did,\" one of them replied. \"Oh well then! I guess we should go tell the Smallfoot that you're going tomorrow.\" \"Communicate.\" \"What ever .\" Stonekeeper lightly chuckled. \"Alright then, go ahead,\" he said. The children ran off. One waved. \"Bye, Stonekeeper!\" He waved back. \"Have a nice day, children.\" He chuckled again. Why do children have to be so Gosh Darn adorable? The Stonekeeper got back up on his mammoth. He looked up. He saw a group of young teenagers doing… something. He wasn't able to tell what it was. Dancing? Not what it looked like*. Probably something they got from the Smallfoot. I doesn't last forever… He looked back on some childhood moments of Meechee and Thorp. Some cute moments, like when they would hop across the furniture saying \"The ice is melting!\", or when they would pretend to be animals. A couple of seriously cute moments, like when they both helped present two new \"Rules Written in Stone\" and pinned them to his robe. These memories made him smile. Then, of course, there were some moments that made him think. Not good thoughts, though, and not because of Thorp and Meechee. He sighed. Not again, He looked around some more. The young teenagers weren't \"dancing\" anymore thankfully. They were now walking away. He looked to the other side. A few other Yetis were walking in the same direction. Actually, it looked like everyone was walking that way. He heard a voice coming from the direction they were walking to. Meechee's voice. The Villagers formed into a crowd near the Yeti Village exit. At the two tusks that represented the exit, Meech- no wait, Migo was talking now. Stonekeeper got to the back of the crowd, still able to see over everyone because he was on his mammoth. Thorp and Fayre were standing with Migo and Meechee. Migo now made a hand gesture towards Meechee and Thorp. Stonekeeper wasn't able to tell why, though. It was hard to hear what they were saying from where he was. Meechee continued talking. From her body moments and facial expressions, it looked like she was excited about something. So did Thorp. It's probably about that thing they needed me for, Stonekeeper thought. He looked for some more. It now looked like everyone at the front was waving towards him. He waved back. He could hear better what they were talking about. Meechee said something about her not going down the mountain, so to \"tell\" (she put air quotes on tell ) the \"Smallfoot\" that she and Thorp were going to stay for today, then tomorrow, them and Stonekeeper were going to go down the mountain. The kids must have told her already, he thought. Meechee finished her speech, then her and Thorp moved out of the exit, leaving Migo and Fayre in the middle where they were standing. Fayre looked like she was telling everyone to follow her, then turned and started walking away. Migo followed her lead. It took about a minute for everyone to walk out of the Yeti Village. Stonekeeper walked a bit slower behind everyone. He approached the exit where Meechee and Thorp were. \"So,\" he began, \"what was it you needed me for?\" Meechee looked up at her father, and excited expression on her face. \"Right this way!\" She started walking into the Yeti Village. Thorp followed her. \"Trust me, Dad, you're-\" \"THORP!\" \"Sorry!\" Stonekeeper followed them both, chuckling. Today's going to be interesting, I just know it . Author's Note: There's Chapter 2 for you! I'll admit that this is one of those in between chapters (chapters that are for the purpose of getting you from interesting point A to interesting point B). But, out of all the in between chapters I've ever written, this is absolutely no doubt about it the best one yet! (I used to practice writing fanfiction. I would always get stuck and give up at the in between chapter) Why is this chapter called Children? Because I'm bad at naming things. Now you know. Without any songs or references, it was hard to write just words (if that makes any sense). I did, however, listen to my playlist while writing the last 300 words, which somewhat reminds me of the elements of the story, and which include some of the Smallfoot soundtrack. What a nice coincidence! Chapters 3 and 4 won't be out for a while, but I'm working on them! (I'm done chapter 3, but I wanted it to tie in nice with chapter 4's begining, so I'll keep three for a while for reference)[Chapter 3] So, I'm done with this chapter! Well, technically, I've been done for a while. I just wanted to keep it for a while for reference to tie into Chapter 4 well. But now I have writer's block… This is Part 1 of \"Unveil\", which is a couple of chapters where their family secrets are unveiled. I am still not good at naming. Warning: a lot more dialogue than the last two chapters. And where it seems like an out of nowhere rap verse, it is not. I feel like this chapter has more cringe moments too. And, one of the unveiling moments is pretty obvious from the start. You have been warned. There's at least two words you will get sick of by the end of this chapter, but I won't say because one is kind of a spoiler. Word Count: 2,005 Stonekeeper, Thorp, and Meechee were walking across the Yeti Village, Meechee was in lead. She was humming randomly while walking and snapping her fingers lightly. It was pretty obvious she was excited about something. Thorp looked really excited about something too. So excited, even, that he had to stay quiet so he wouldn't spoil anything. Stonekeeper found this very cute. Just like when they were kids, he thought. Now I really can't wait! Meechee slowed down her walking. Stonekeeper looked around at where they were. They had just past the edge of the Yeti Village. Why…? He looked up at his two children. \"Um, Thorp, Meechee, why are… why are we walking past the end of the Village?\" He was deeply confused. \"You'll see,\" Meechee yelled over her shoulder. She walked some more, then came to a stop at a line on the ground. Thorp walked a bit faster. \"Right this way,\" he said. He was getting better at not blurting out the surprise (like he did at least twice already this morning, instead of more times), so Meechee trusted him enough to at least say something every once in awhile until they can tell him the surprise. He stopped at that same line right beside Meechee. Stonekeeper walked up to them both. He was confused on why they had stopped randomly. Why did they stop? He looked down at where they were standing. Then he saw it, the line. I should've known. This line represented the border for the edge of the Yeti Village. They weren't crossing it because Stone 23 said, \" You may never cross the border, unless you have permission from the Stonekeeper \", and it was what they've grown to learn. Alright, then, he thought with a chuckle. \"Thorp and Meechee,\" he began in his great leader tone; he tapped his purple turtle staff onto the ground, just because he just so happened to carry it with him. \"You have now been granted permission to cross the border.\" He pointed his staff to and area outside the border. Meechee stepped past the line as if it was her first time stepping foot on exciting foreign land, while Thorp walked more casually. Stonekeeper followed close behind them. \"Meechee, you looked like you've never walked past the border,\" he said. \"Well, that's because I haven't.\" Stonekeeper wasn't buying it. He decided to have some fun with it. \"So, you mean to tell me that the \"S.E.S.\" was inside the border? That every time I saw footprints outside the line, they weren't from you or any of your friends?\" He had a point there. \"Well,\" she replied, \"it was never around here. Only more near the exit.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" They kept on walking for a while. Thorp felt the need to ask the obvious. \"Uh, Dad-\" Meechee quickly turned around and pointed at Thorp with a 'Don't. Say. Anything' expression on her face. Thorp backed up a bit, raising his hands in the air. \"Relax, it was just an unrelated question.\" Meechee lowered her hand. \"Good.\" She turned and continued walking. If it wasn't obvious before, they are undoubtedly up to something. Stonekeeper thought. \"So, Thorp, what was that question of yours?\" \"Oh, yes,\" Thorp replied, \"I was just wondering randomly… why exactly do we have a border? And why isn't it, I don't know, taller?\" A good question indeed, but one that was already asked before a few years before. \"This you should know the answer to. But, I'll explain it anyways.\" He stopped walking. Thorp and Meechee stopped walking as well, and turned around to face Stonekeeper. He tapped his staff on the ground. \"You see, you two, we have a border for a very important reason-\" \"I've heard this story a million times,\" Meechee muttered under her breath, not knowing that her father could actually hear what she was saying. \"Yes, but this story, I've never told,\" Stonekeeper replied, making Meechee look embarrassed. \"A story told from our past,\" With a bit of my own spin added to it. \" Yes, this is a story I've never told to anyone, so appreciate it, even though this tale is old: \" The reason there is a border in place is to keep the Villagers away from a group of rogue Yetis, the \"Nonbelievers\", for another day \" Just like you and your friends, Meechee, they believed the Stones weren't true But they took it way too far, Something beyond me and you \" They wanted to prove their point To the Village far and wide They were planning to take out the Stones They were planning regicide \" The Princess had heard this, Told her father right away, With the way he reacted, He became Alpha Male that day \" He banned them from the Village None of their family excluded If any were to return They would be executed! \" He made a border around the Village In many different ways This border we build up and enforce To this very day \" This may all seem unfair And we're not an unfair Nation But in all, the question is What would you do in this situation?\" Meechee and Thorp looked like Migo did seven years earlier when confronted with a similar situation when debating whether or not to speak the truth of the existence of Smallfoot. \"That's what I thought. You would do the same, wouldn't you?\" They, again, both looked like Migo did in this type of situation. Stonekeeper sighed. \"But, in good news,\" he began, \"while patrolling the border one day while I was… twenty five? Yeah, twenty five. I came across a rouge.\" Thorp and Meechee's expression changed to interested. A rogue? They wanted to know more! \"I was walking around the border. My father had told me to patrol the border as one of the ways to practice the role of Stonekeeper. He even told me I could grow the border a bit more if none of the jealous Nonbelievers were around. His words, not mine. I walked around a second time. It looked like no one was there. Of course I would follow the Stones, at the time I didn't know the truth. But, my arrogant self at the time told me that I could walk around more than enough to just grow our border because I was going to be Stonekeeper. No, I was going to explore, going to find something, someone. I didn't believe that they were all like that, and didn't think that they were still like that. It turns out I was right.\" Stonekeeper stopped for a second, a depressed expression growing on his face. Meechee was confused. Why is this sad? Did someone die or something? She tilted her head a bit. Thorp could see Meechee's confusion. He felt the same way. \"Go on.\" Stonekeeper snapped out of it. \"Oh, yes, sorry. Now, where was I? Oh, yes.\" He let out a sigh. \"So, while going past the border, I met one. A rogue Yeti. And at that point, I knew there was good in some of them. She was very, very kind and smart, a-and beautiful. The colour of her fur was just magnificent that day and every other day after that. She's so caring and so great a-at… everything…\" He noticed he was getting off track. He looked at Meechee and Thorp. Meechee was gushing over the way he was describing this mysterious rogue, even though she already knew who it was, and it was pretty obvious. Thorp looked kind of bored like if he wanted Stonekeeper to just get to the point already. This distracted him enough that he was able to give in to a light smile. \"I'm surprised you find this boring, Thorp. After all, you met yours the same way I met mine.\" \"Yeah, sorry. It's just, Fayre doesn't like talking about her life from before she moved to the Village, and you have refused to tell stories about her for… years. I'm just not used to people telling me these stories, and once you started drifting off into the sky thinking about her , I just got bored,\" Thorp explained. Ha, never thought of it that way. \"Well, I guess you're right. I'll stop being so boring and cont-\" \"Actually, Dad,\" Meechee interrupted, \"I just remembered to ask you something.\" I hope it's not related… Stonekeeper put on a smile. \"And what might that be, Meechee?\" Please don't be sad when I say this, but… \"Would you mind taking us to the exact location you met Mom?\" Stonekeeper's smile slowly faded. So, it is related. \"Oh. Okay. Sure. Let's… let's go. It's this way.\" Stonekeeper pointed his staff to a higher part of the mountain. \"I will warn you, though, that it's a-a bit colder than you're used to.\" He started walking to his destination. Meechee sighed. What have I done? She walked behind her father. Thorp followed. He walked up to Meechee. \"Bad timing, Meechee,\" he softly whispered. She glared at him with and expression that read 'You don't think I know that?'. She looked away. I feel terrible . They walked to that higher part of the mountain. None dared to ask another question. Stonekeeper's walking became slower as they approached their destination. He came to a full stop a few feet away. \"Well, here we are,\" he said. Meechee and Thorp stopped and stood beside him. They looked up. This part of the mountain looked a bit higher than they thought it would be. It would take a bit of a climb to reach the top. Stonekeeper just stood there. Thorp and Meechee could understand why, but still found it kind of strange. Thorp decided to break the silence. \"We still don't know where you met her. That much you still need to show us.\" Stonekeeper looked at Thorp. He nodded. \"A-alright, I'll show you.\" He started to walk, still slowly, but he was moving. Meechee and Thorp looked at each other, and nodded with a smirk. They walked at the same speed as their father on either side of him. Stonekeeper started to climb, Thorp alongside him. Meechee, though, was climbing much slower and breathing a bit differently than before. Stonekeeper was confused. He turned around to face Meechee. \"Uh, Meechee, why are you going so slow? You were fine a minute ago.\" She looked up at her father. \"Sorry. I think I have to be a bit more careful now since… I'm pregnant.\" \"I guess that- wait, what?\" Meechee put her hand on her belly, then looked up, smiling. A smile a mile wide grew on Stonekeeper's face. \"R-Really?\" Meechee replied in a nod and the biggest smile on her face. Stonekeeper walked down to Meechee. Without warning, he gave her the biggest hug. While surprised, Meechee returned the hug. Thorp just kind of stood there. Somewhat jealous, but more just finding this moment absolutely adorable. They broke apart. Stonekeeper had the smallest bit of water in his eyes; you wouldn't be able to tell at first. Meechee couldn't help but give a big smile and tilt her head playfully. \"Daddy, are you… crying?\" At first, she wouldn't let the thought cross her mind. She could only remember one other time he had cried; when he truly cried and was afraid to show it. Then again, that day, all three of them were crying, and it was over twenty years ago. And he's feeling it again. Poor Dad. Stonekeeper was purely embarrassed. \"I-I'm not crying, you're crying!\" They all lightly chuckled. \"I have really let myself go…\" Stonekeeper muttered. The other two were both confused. \"What is that supposed to mean?\" Thorp asked. Stonekeeper was embarrassed again. \"Sorry about that. I'll tell you on the way up.\" He put an arm around Meechee, having his official parental instinct kick in. He put one around Thorp too, just because. It would definitely be harder to climb up now, though. Yet, Stonekeeper didn't care, for at this very moment, he was happy. Part 2 of \"Unveil\" will be out sooner or later, where more is unveiled, and- yeah, you know what, that would be a spoiler. Also, I apologize for any cringe moments and that obvious unveil. I made this chapter 2x the size because those other chapters were waaay too short. Hopefully this one is decent in size and everything else. Until next chapter![Chapter 4] ~Update: I made a MAJOR change to the story. It's just a bit of dialogue but It. Changes. Everything! This is about to be interesting!~ Welcome back to my little fanfiction! Here is chapter 4. This is the second and last part of \"Unveil\", but not the last chapter. There will be at least one more chapter. But, it seems that I'll be making a sequel. After the secret unveiled in the last chapter, I can't just stop now! There's another original song in this one. Only, this time, it's longer. It's not the best, but it serves its purpose. It was half inspired by \"Wonderful Life\", but is not as much like it. Also, I should mention that after the song, the pacing is faster than normal. This is because it was already, like, 3 AM when I wrote that part (but I'm not exactly sure what time it was, I never checked). Also, there's a lot more stuttering in this chapter. The good news is that I broke my record for how many words I can write in a row: over 2,000 in a few hours! This just so happens to be the longest chapter, by the way. I undoubtedly screwed up their characters, so bare with me! *: No pun intended Word count: 3,235 As they were walking up that part of the mountain, Stonekeeper told them both about what he meant earlier. \"I used to be able to tell,\" he explained. \"Just by the overall behaviour of the one expecting would most times give it away. Sometimes, it was something else.\" Meechee was interested in what this \"something else\" could be. \"How else were you able to tell?\" Thorp was also interested, but didn't know how to counter-ask to Meechee's question. \"Yeah, how,\" is all he could think of. \"Well, I just don't know how to explain it. It's just this… this, um… \"glow\".\" Stonekeeper gave a shrug. He was really at a loss for words here. He didn't know how he would possibly now explain the meaning of \"glow\". Lucky, he wouldn't really have to. \"Well,\" Meechee began, \"Migo did say something about my appearance over all being brighter, so I guess it's that.\" I guess so, Stonekeeper thought, not letting himself get jealous over the fact that he wasn't even able to tell if his own daughter was expecting, when he was able to tell if anyone else was expecting not too long ago. Alright, he did get jealous. He just didn't want to ruin the current happy mood. They reached the top. It was a rather nice scene, actually. It was a flat edge next to the entrance of a cave. There was an evergreen tree there, something they didn't see up in their mountain home often. The area had quite a lot of snow around it. It probably wasn't visited often, not even by the rouges. Any type of happy feeling Stonekeeper had escaped him the moment he got a good look at the scene. Again, he was back with a frown on his face. Thorp had noticed this. He had hoped against this, but it didn't work. We're never getting to that story, are we? Stonekeeper didn't notice that he just stood there again. Meechee and Thorp stood there with him, waiting for him to move. Probably a minute of standing and waiting went by before Stonekeeper snapped out of it. He walked forward, pointing his staff towards the entrance of the cave. \"This is where I-I met her.\" He stood in front of the entrance. As if like clockwork, Thorp and Meechee sat down in front of him, looking up. This made Stonekeeper smile, but not for too long. Just like Story Time, he thought. He cleared his throat. \"Like I said before, this was a long time ago. I climbed up this very part of the mountain, just for a look at the landscape. Once I got up, I looked and saw what you would think I would see: white.\" They both turned around, just to see snow. Stonekeeper found this amusing. He gave a slight chuckle. \"Made you look.\" They turned back, smiling. \"Yeah, I guess you did,\" Thorp said. Stonekeeper's smile disappeared slowly as he remembered his story. \"Yes. A-as I was saying, all I saw was white. But something was different. For the first time, I looked down a-at the horizon, and… no one was there. I would usually look down from my window and see Yetis walking around. Even at night, there was at least one or two awake. I-I don't know, it just felt different.\" He paused for a second. This was the part they wanted to hear the most, and it would be the hardest for him to tell. He looked down at his children for a second, then looked back up. \"I guess I was right for it feeling different. It took me a bit of time to realize, but there was someone behind me. Someone with a weapon.\" \"Ooh!\" They both knew they had an idea of just who he was talking about. Then again, it could be someone else, who knows? \"I-I didn't even need to turn around to know that there was someone behind me, or that they were armed. I-I just didn't expect… who, it was.\" Stonekeeper stopped for a second. Thorp and Meechee got up and stood beside him. They knew it would be harder now than earlier to talk about her. \"She was holding a-a spear, stopped at the entrance of this cave, looking at me. I-I guessed that she was the protector of the rogues, o-or in some similar task. For whatever reason, she didn't attack. I-I trespassed. I was on their land, and there was no rule saying that I could be there. She had every right to attack… but, she didn't. She just stood there. She held the spear as if she were to attack, but didn't.\" \"Isn't that against rogue law or something?\" Thorp asked. \"I remember Fayre said something like that. If any from our Village were to leave the border, the rogues could take their lives! If the rogue wouldn't perform their task, they would be seen as untrustworthy. Mom could've gotten killed! Your talking about Mom, right?\" Stonekeeper despised that word. A word of violence and hatred. A word him and the Village didn't go by. He sighed. \"Y-yes, I am talking about your mother.\" He already knew about the harsh lifestyle of the rogues, and the rules put in place. Hearing about them the first time made him hate all rules. Unfortunately, he was the Stonekeeper, and had to wear the literal \"Rules Written in Stone\" as a robe at the time. In the meantime, they were able to make peace with some of the rogues. Two of them being very significant to Thorp and Stonekeeper. \"What happened next?\" Stonekeeper looked at both of his children for a second. If it weren't for this next part, they wouldn't be standing there right now. \"I finally turned around t-to see her. She was beautiful. Her hair was in two smaller braids a-at the front, and the rest was just down. Messy, but it didn't look bad. Her eyes w-were a beautiful blue, unlike what I have ever seen. Her fur and hair colour being o-over all a blue-purple tone. She… she looked a lot like you, Meechee.\" \"Really? How much?\" Meechee didn't remember too well what her mother looked like, but she remembered her colour and hair. While Meechee's hair and fur is more purple, her fur wasn't as long, and she never got to leaving her hair untied. In her opinion, though, they're pretty much identical. \"Very much, actually,\" Stonekeeper replied. \"Even the way your horns are positioned and everything. If you two were two… s-stand beside each other-\" \"Wait, Dad, wasn't Mom closer to your height than Meechee is right now?\" Of course, it was Thorp who interrupted. Probably at a good time, too. He just so happened to unintentionally brighten up the mood. Stonekeeper smiled for a second. \"Give your sister a break. She's only a young adult. She still needs to grow some more.\" No, I'm just short. Even though Thorp was only three years older than her, Meechee always felt as if they were treating her as if she were much younger. Usually she would confront them about this, but because her father was happy, she just let it lie*. She did, however, find it interesting that one of the only traits she didn't inherit from her mother was height. Then again, it could be that she needs to grow more. That's more unlikely, though. Another thing she just let lie. \"I guess that could be it.\" Unfortunately, Stonekeeper didn't forget what they were talking about. \"S-so, anyways, we looked at each other for a while. Then, o-out of nowhere, she pulls me out of view and takes me to a-a place behind some rocks. She told me that I was free to go, and I-I had to leave quickly.\" The other two silently cursed to themselves, a worried look on their faces. They both knew why he had to leave, and they hated it. Why did it have to be this way? \"Before I-I left, she told me her name. I was unsure why, though. I mean, I-I had no intention of learning her name; she was supposed to kill me a minute before. But, she did. Then I-I left.\" I wonder what her name was, both Thorp and Meechee thought at the same time. They knew better than to ask the questions if they wanted the story to continue, so they didn't. \"I felt terrible f-for just leaving her there. So terrible, I returned less than an hour later. I-I wasn't going to return empty handed, though. I got our adviser at the time t-to come with me, and made up a stone saying that I could pardon o-one to live among our Village. Even though it was against the law to make your own stone unless you're the Stonekeeper, it was the only way. When I approached the cave from earlier, i-it disgusted me to she t-the way the others w-were treating her. And although the other rogues d-didn't care much for the Stonekeeper a-and all the other Villagers, the \"law\" said that I could take her with us. S-so, they turned her over. On the way back, I-I ended up telling her my name.\" Stonekeeper just stood there for a few seconds before coming to a realization of what he just said. I just remembered my name! A smile managed to find its way onto his face. Meechee gushed over this. They saved each other?! That's adorable! Love at first sight! Thorp found this story quite nice. He never knew that his parents went against the rules just to save each other. And all he did was meet his mate and her family near the border edges one day while he and his father were walking by, then invited them to live in the Village. They both knew that this wasn't the end of the story, though. There was still a lot to it. Stonekeeper cleared his throat. \"That's not the end, of course. I knew that I did the right thing that day, and I was proud of myself. When I returned home, though, that was a different story. At first, my father was skeptical about her living in the Village with us. She was their protector, after all. Also, the rogues could catch on the fake law and try to get her back. I was about to tell him why she should stay, but… I didn't have to. She told her story, sang it even, and she had the most beautiful voice. It was outstanding the amount of tough times she went through, and what she was willing to do to prove herself worthy of a good home. My father was convinced, and she got to stay. When she wasn't nearby, my father told me she could one day be my mate. I agreed with him.\" This left a smile on everyone's faces. Such a heartwarming and inspirational story, and it was all real. At this point, time could go on forever. They just wanted to hear more. Stonekeeper felt happy. He had his two beautiful children for support, and he was able to get through that last bit without stuttering. He decided to get the boring part out of the way, since it looked like they still wanted to hear him tell the story. \"Of course, then, we spend some time together. Months go by and we become mates, bla bla bla, other stuff you don't care about,\" Stonekeeper started off. \"Slightly before we wanted to be mated, though, my father, he… he past away. My mother soon after.\" There was no going back now. This was no longer the Disney-style happily ever after that they've hoped for. More like a nightmare. No part of this was going to be easy for Stonekeeper. Thorp and Meechee stayed hopeful for an ending, though. So, the show must go on. \"Now, a-all of a sudden, I had t-to be Stonekeeper! I-It was simply t-too much for me all that w-was helping me. Although Le- your mother helped me get through some of it, i-it a-always hurt, and a-a part of that will n-never go away…\" Stonekeeper felt as if her were about to lose it. He took a fairly long break, but no one minded. \"W-we ended up becoming mates not long after. Not much time had gone by before you two came into our lives. You two were the light in our lives. We even thought of having a third. But, then, of course, the illness…\" Although they knew that the rest was unnecessary, Stonekeeper didn't look like he was going to stop anytime soon. \"It was all s-so sudden. No one knew what it was at first, not even the Healer. Until… they figured out what it was.\" Stonekeeper took a deep breath. \"B-but, your mother w-was destined to find a cure. She would stop a-at nothing, a-a-and was willing to travel miles, go f-for hours… and, she… she n-never…\" It was too much for all of them. They all got into a big hug on the ground. With her head buried into her father's chest, Meechee completed the sentence. \"...she left for the cure… and we f-found it… and she isn't… h-here...\" The trio sat there in silence for a while. It was then that Thorp asked the most random question. \"I don't mean to ruin this moment, but, is Meechee looking like Mom the reason you loved her more as a child?\" They all stood up. Stonekeeper put his hand on Thorp's shoulder. What kind of… \"What kind of a question is that?\" \"A question I've been meaning to ask for a while.\" Stonekeeper shook his head. \"Thorp, I never loved Meechee more. I loved you both the same. It's just, when hard times came, Meechee came to me more than you did. You distanced yourself from us, so after a while, I stopped trying. I-I shouldn't have stopped trying though. Y-your my son, a-and I let you distance yourself. All because I-I couldn't let her go…\" Meechee walked forwards and stood in front of her father. She looked at him with a smile, then took a deep breath. I know you haven't been yourself lately So I'm giving you a chance To take away those dreadful thoughts To find your happiness Introduce this slowly 'cause this Depression doesn't last Enjoy the world around you Stop grieving for the past Take a step to recovery Look around, what do you see? You should see the ones that you helped See the ones that you've set free So let her go Come live in the present, with us Let go of that depression, and trust That you'll find your happiness, it's true I wanna see my father, see the real you I know you have time to remember Those memories that are bad Take a moment out of life Take a moment to feel glad You have two beautiful children We stick together like ice When you take a second to think You'll realize, our family's quite nice Take a step to recovery Look around, what do you see? You should see the ones that you helped See the ones that you've set free So let her go Come live in the present, with us Let go of that depression, and trust That you'll find your happiness, it's true I wanna see my father, see the real you I know she can't return, I know this makes us sad And just want to grieve But we got to work together, We can all get through this And I believe Even though she's gone And I didn't know her a lot That was twenty years ago Now look at what you got A small but great family Even though you don't see your wife We all stick together And make a wonderful life Take a step to recovery Look around, what do you see? You should see the ones that you helped See the ones that you've set free So let her go Come live in the present, with us Let go of that depression, and trust That you'll find your happiness, it's true I wanna see my father, see the real you Ooo I wanna see my father, see the real you Oooooo I wanna see my father, see the real you Stonekeeper couldn't help but smile. \"Meechee…\" He couldn't find the words. He walked up to his daughter and gave her a big hug. While in the warm embrace, Meechee's hair tie got kind of loose. Once her father finally let go, her hair was a bit messed up and it was noticeable. This gave her an idea. \"Um, Daddy,\" she began. She took the hair tie out of the bottom of her braid. \"Do you mind tying my hair?\" Stonekeeper found this adorable. \"Sure.\" He passed his staff to his son. \"Thorp,do you mind holding this?\" \"Not at all!\" He gladly took the staff and examined it. \"This looks so cool!\" he whispered. He really likes it, doesn't he? Stonekeeper thought. He started to undo Meechee's braid, taking his time. \"How would you like it?\" \"How you would like it.\" Stonekeeper's smile grew. Using some of his own ties, he tied her hair in a way that only felt natural to him. \"Done.\" It might've taken a while, but the end result was worth it. Thorp, no longer distracted by the purple turtle staff, looked to Meechee for a second. \"Wow, Meechee, you look nice!\" \"Really?\" Stonekeeper looked at Meechee with awe. \"More than nice. You look absolutely amazing!\" A smile a mile wide grew on her face. \"Thank you, both!\" She stretched out her arms. They all got into yet another group hug, only breaking apart after a minute. \"We should be heading back now,\" Stonekeeper said. They all agreed. They walked together down the mountain, this time both Stonekeeper and Thorp helping Meechee down. They walked back to the Village. Past the border line, Stonekeeper stopped walking and looked back at his children. \"I see your really fond of that staff, Thorp.\" Meechee and Thorp stopped walking. He didn't notice he was still holding the staff. \"Oh, sorry Dad. Here you go.\" He held it out for his father to get. Stonekeeper declined. \"No, you can hold it.\" \"Okay!\" Meechee found this unusual. But he never lets anyone hold it for too long… \"Actually Thorp, how would you like to keep it?\" This confused Thorp. \"Keep it?\" Stonekeeper looked at both of his children. \"I'm getting old. I'm starting to become too unfit to be leader anymore, and who knows how much longer I'll be around for. But you, Thorp… you would be the next leader anyway, and you would make a great leader.\" \"Are… are you saying…\" \"Yes. I'm making you the new leader of the Yeti Village.\" Thorp didn't know what to say. \"I humbly accept this responsib- forget it. Yes, I'll be the next leader of the Village!\" He put his hands together. \"But, I might need a little bit of help, if you don't mind.\" \"Not at all.\" Stonekeeper looked at them both again: his beautiful daughter, and his son, the new leader. \"Let's go home and rest. It's been a long day.\" That was \"Unveil: Part 2\" for ya! Again, this chapter was not at all perfect, but it is the part I've been wanting to get out of my system for a little over a month now. I have finally figured out Fayre's character: a minor character, but with knowledge and experience with rogue Yetis. This makes Thorp basically an expert when it comes to the laws of both the Yeti Village and the rogues. So, yeah. That explanation on why Thorp wasn't \"loved\" as much as a kid is not the original idea. PM me if you want to know the original reason. Now that I have over 6,000 words of a story written down, I can now be a BetaReader! Not like you care, anyways. Chapter 5 will be out soon. See ya next time! ","Summary":" Author's Note: Hello, people on the Internet! Welcome to the first chapter of my first fanfiction ("},{"Movie":"Someone Like You","Title":"Mice Will Play","Author":"HazelnutCookie","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3891268","Passage":"[Chapter 1] After not seeing Ally Rhone for nearly five years, Eddie Alden almost didn't recognize her, could have walked right past her like she was a painting on the wall. However, there was something that made her stand out as he passed her on the street, something that made him glance over his shoulder to her. It was the smell of her perfume, the same Yves Saint Laurent fragrance that she had always worn, and that he hadn't smelled the same way since. She looked different, not entirely but little changes here and there. Her hair was short, a wavy windblown look that stopped just past her shoulders, it used to be longer, nearly down her back. There were streaks of blonde going through it now, riding the milk chocolate colored waves. Her eyes hadn't changed though, they were still the clear brown they had always been, with a ring of gold around the outsides, and they were heavily framed by thick black lashes. Her name was on his lips, he was ready to open his mouth and call out of her, but almost as soon as he had noticed her, she had disappeared into the ebbing sea of New Yorkers. The sun was beating down mercilessly on his back and he wasn't in the mood to be trampled by tourists and natives, too busy to notice that a mad had suddenly been turned into a statue. He made his way back to his apartment in the Upper East Side, his head still in a dim yet unrelenting fog. He walked up the stairs not really paying attention, and when he reached his front door, he was also shocked that he had arrived, thought that he might have floated up the long creaky stairway. Eddie dumped his groceries onto the counter and noticed, almost with relief that Jane had already left for her yoga class, which she did about three times a week. Eddie walked out onto the adjacent balcony and irritably began to smoke a cigarette, never minding the heat of the day and paying more attention to the sweet burning on the back of his tongue. What right did Ally have to show up again? He thought as he passed the lit Marlboro from finger to finger, never minding the ash that was dropping to his jeans. She had skipped down when she was twenty years old, and now just came back to Manhattan out of the blue. After puffing the cigarette to a stump and crushing it out on the marble of the balcony, faintly registering that Jane was going to give him hell for it later, an uncomfortable thought passed through his mind. Was he upset that she had come back, or that she had come back and not given him a call? He gave the dying cigarette an extra stomp for good measure and turned to start a shower, letting the door slide shut behind him, letting the glass rattle in the frame. The hot water rushing over his body did him some good, the clammy feel of the steam and the smell of the soap cleared his head, letting him think more clearly. He wasn't going to let it ruin his mood any more than it already had today. It was his and Jane's one year anniversary, and everything had to be perfect. He wrapped a towel around his waist and began arranging the flowers he had bought into the crystal vase that above the sink. Jane had added all sorts of feminine touches to his once bare loft. Once the flowers to his liking, he began to cook the breakfast. The smell of the sizzling bacon wafted through the room and almost seemed like aromatherapy to him, and for the first time that day, a smile crossed over his face. He was dry and dressed, hair combed neatly, both breakfast and flowers were out on the table, waiting any minute for Jane to come through the door. Eddie sat at the table, absentmindedly playing with the petals of the white and pink lilies, or pushing the bacon and berries around on his plate with a fork. He hated blueberries, but Jane insisted that they take a regular part of their diets, so Eddie did the best he could to oblige. It was ten minutes later before Jane pushed her way through the door, trying to balance her yoga mat, her work out clothes, and her keys. Eddie jumped to his feet and took the mat from her hands, allowing her to make it through the narrow doorway. \"Hey baby,\" He said as he kissed her, and registered that her lips had a faint salty taste of sweat and the honey lip balm she always carried around. The taste wasn't unpleasant; it was something he knew he could always depend on when he kissed her. \"Hey you, everything looks amazing,\" She said as her dark eyes scanned the apartment, taking in the flowers and breakfast. \"I love you\" She said as she stole a kiss from his lips. Again, the salt and honey taste. They sat down together and began to eat before the food got too cold, making pleasant small talk and occasionally, Eddie would lean over and take her hand, look her directly in the eye, and kiss the bridge of her nose. All the little things he knew that she loved. After they had eaten and Jane watched Eddie clean up, they made love in their bedroom, slow and attentive, two bodies gliding over each other, hearts beating heavily. Jane took her turn in the shower, and just as Eddie entertained the thought of slipping in behind her and soaping up her back, there was a knock at the door. Eddie turned to answer it, expecting to see the little boy down the hall, hoping for a quarter. He dug into his pockets and pulled out some stray changed that had fallen out of his wallet. \"I hope you're hungry today Nate\" He said as he pulled open the door. \"Not really, I already ate. How you doing Eddie?\" \"Hi Ally\"[Chapter 2] Eddie's eyes almost fell out of his head. He had almost forgotten how short that she was, she barely came up to his chest and she looked about as sly as the cat that ate the canary. \"Did you miss me?\" She asked, her cunning smile crossing her unpainted lips. Eddie had to fight every instinct not to simultaneously pull her into a tight hug, and slam the door in her face. He wanted to say something, anything, but couldn't seem to find his voice. His jaw opened like he was about to say something, but then snapped back shut just as quickly. Finally he managed \"What're you doing here?\" But it was croaky, and he didn't like it. Ally seemed to pout, \"Not quite the welcome home that I expected, but I'll take what I can get\" She regarded him almost warily. She looked around him and Eddie blocked the door way with his built 6'2 frame. Ally rolled her eyes and shoved past Eddie and walked into the apartment. \"Nice, you finally cleaned it up a bit,\" She said teasingly and walked over to the kitchen table where the lilies were still sitting in center display. \"Looks like Becca finally got to you, I thought you'd never cave and get rid of the whole 'frat boy' apartment. Where is Becs anyway?\" Eddie stiffened and Ally looked up at him curiously. \"No more Becca?\" She asked, her lips still pouting out a little bit. Eddie was beginning to hate the way that Ally was looking at him, with a mix of sympathy and accusation. He shook his head and she raised one perfectly shaped eyebrow. \"Then what's with all the stuff? I know you didn't buy this,\" She said as she picked up a oversized white silk pillow \"By yourself, so who did?\" She tossed it back down on the couch and turned to face Eddie with the same slightly mocking smile on her lips. \"Actually, I bought it\" Eddie turned on his heel to see Jane standing in the doorway of the bathroom. Her hair was still damp, but she was wearing a black tank top and loose fitting jeans that slipped off her slim hips. \"I'm Eddie's girlfriend.\" Ally's cynical smile disappeared and bloomed into a dazzling one. \"Oh how cute\" She gushed and reached out her had to shake Jane's. \"I'm Ally Rhone, me and your boy toy go way back\" Jane looked at Ally's hand for a minute, as if it was some poisonous snake that was just waiting to bite her. \"Jane Goodale\" She slowly shook Ally's hand. She noticed that Ally had neatly manicured fingers, unpainted but still very feminine, and that she was generally a very beautiful girl, and then, a very young girl. \"Jane Goodale,\" Ally repeated with the small smile back on her lips, as if it was permanently there \"Like the chick with the chimps' right?\" Eddie had the overpowering urge to want to laugh, Ally had always had a way of saying things. \"Not to seem rude, but how old are you?\" Jane asked, eyeing Ally up and down. Ally tilted her head and let a spill of glazed hair fall over her shoulder as she regarded Jane through her expressive brown eyes. \"25. How old are you?\" The same smirk of a smile was still glued in place, and Eddie had the feeling that Jane might try to smack her. Jane turned sharply to Eddie and gave him a very calculated kiss on the lips. There was no salt taste this time, but still the same sweet balmy taste. \"I'm going to make some reservations for tonight before they get booked up,\" Than turned to Ally \"It is our one year anniversary today after all\" \"Oh, how nice for you\" Ally said sweetly, although there was an impish glimmer behind her eyes. Jane rolled her eyes and went into her bedroom to dry off before she left the apartment to brave the hot New York City summer heat. \"She seems nice,\" Ally said as she found herself a comfortable spot on the slightly run down couch and snuggled a little deeper. \"Older, but pretty, good for you\" Now Eddie was afraid that he might smack her. She was exactly the same that she had been five years ago, and while he couldn't decide if it was reassuring or not, he still sort of liked her cynicism while she was still young enough to get away with it. Middle ages cynics weren't cute, they were depressing. Finally, he was managed to find his voice again. \"So you came back?\" Ally laughed a little and crossed her legs. \"Apparently, I guess the city called to me. I traveled around, met some interesting people, a lot of people actually. I've been fishing in Alaska, I taught sailing in Turks and Caicos for a while and you know I always loved sailing. Than there was Italy, Morocco, those two didn't last very long. Arizona and Ireland lived in the south of France for about two years, oh and then there was some God-forsaken little spit of land in Kansas. However, somehow, I really began to miss home\" At the word 'home', her eyes met his and Eddie left as if he had just grabbed a weak, but still very much alive, wire. There was a odd tingling sensation going down his arms and he wondered if it would be too cliché to have a heart attack at that very moment. \"You just up and left, you hardly said a word\" Eddie told her as he sat in the single seat across from her. The guilt that she was feeling seemed to shrink her. \"I know,\" She admitted as she sat up straight, her hands folded in her lap. She almost looked like a little girl who had gotten into trouble and was being lectured by the principal. \"I wanted to call you so badly while I was gone, but I figured that you would be mad, and I know you and I know that it's a lot easier for you to be mad and hate someone than to miss them and worry, so I let you hate me \"You had Rebecca, and I knew that she would help you get over whatever you were going through with me. I know that we were best friends back than, and it was a pretty shitty thing for me to do, but I had my own reasons for doing it. I never forgot about you though Ed and I always wanted to call you to make sure you were alright but...\" Her shoulders kind of slumped to her side, like a puppet whose strings had been abruptly cut by a mad puppeteer. All the words she wanted to tell him had spilled out of her in a mess, and now she didn't look like the deviant twenty year old he used to know, or the fiery girl who was trying to goad on his girlfriend a minute ago. Now, Ally just looked a little tired, like someone who had been running for a long time, but than had no where else to run to. There was a weird sensation that was bubbling in the pit of his stomach, something that felt cold and metallic, but alive. \"Do you want to get some coffee?\" He asked finally. At the sound of his voice, Ally sat back up again, there was a tiny glimmer of hope behind her eyes. \"And sushi?\" Eddie had to laugh; she had a funny way of making him do that. \"Sure, and sushi. Let's go.\" ","Summary":" After not seeing Ally Rhone for nearly five years, Eddie Alden almost didn't recognize her, could h"},{"Movie":"Rock and Rule","Title":"White Noise","Author":"Danger.Rae","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7849148","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prolouge: \"Well, you OBVIOUSLY don't know what you are doing\" Jack teased, pulling off his signature smirk. I frowned, trying to be angry with him. Why does he have to be so hot? I thought to myself. i wrapped my hands around the steering wheel. \"Hey! I do too! It's not my fault I'm scared of driving!\" I retort. He just laughed, \"that's why we're trying kid!\" he laughed once more, before moving his guitar out of the way. \"Out of all the vehicles, why your truck?\" I say, scrunching up my nose from the mess. Guitar picks, paper, drawings, various bottles, and candy wrappers. Not to mention a few knives here and there, [I cut my hand on one while using the shift stick, it hurt] but even though his truck was nasty, it had his scent, which is what I loved more than anything. I turned to the twenty two year old musician. He started saying something, but I wasn't paying attention, I was lost in his ocean blue eyes. \"KID!\" he shouted at me. \"WHAT?!\" I shouted back. \"Did you even hear me? Or were you to busy being a teenage girl?\" he sneered. I frowned, \"I'm eighteen idiot!\" \"Sure you are so are you ready or not?\" he asked. I nodded, \"no shit Sherlock\" I put the truck in gear and slowly backed out of the parking lot his apartment was located at. He kept coaxing me through it, even though I was scared to drive. The first time I did, the other driver pulled out in front of me, and flipped my car, luckily I was alive. Jack's voice was soothing; I loved hearing it, especially when he sang at bars. He would step on stage, with Karkrash, Bashy, and Erik. Karkrash would stand to the left of him, playing bass. Bashy, in the back, yet the loudest, play the drums. Leaving Erik to play keyboard, rhythm guitar or what was needed for that song. Of course Jack played the guitar, and of course he was the lead singer. Cocky ass prick.. I'd always tell him to give Karkrash a turn, since he was a good singer. But noooo, it had to be him singing. Then I'd say, well, why don't you sing one of Bashy's songs, or hell even mine? Nooooope. Once again, you cocky ass prick. But every time he was on stage, I would stare into those ocean blue orbs. why did he have to be so perfect? I thought. Shoulder length blonde hair, muscular, but not body builder, six feet tall, slightly tan, deep voice, deep minded, thoughtful, sweet, yet cocky, and annoying. Wore ripped jeans, boots, and plaid or band shirts. He was perfect, every girl wanted him. They crowed around him, attacking him, he was like Justin beiber or Andy six. Me? Only five feet tall, wore anything from all black to colours. If stereotyped id be border line punk. Really short brown hair, like roxette, or la roux hair, pale skin, and grey eyes. And to top it off I had the make-up and shoes to match. I was staring at my clunky black boots. I think my left one was coming untied. \"Pay attention!\" he said, sounding like a teacher. \"Yes sir\" I saluted. Just to make things clear, yes I am 18 years old, yes I do not have my license, and yes I am in love with Jack. I turned to windshield wipers on, it was snowing. It was December 23rd and Jack's present to me? To make me relive my worst fear over and over again till it became nothing. He said it was to help me conquer my driving phobia, but truth be told, it was really because he was tired of picking me up and wasting gas on me. Don't I feel special? \"Turn left here\" he said, pointing. I turned left, \"where are we going anyway?\" I asked. \"You'll see\" he said nonchalantly. I shrugged. Jack flipped on the radio, and fiddled with it till he got to an 80's rock station. \"… Don't need you! I don't live in this town, don't trust you Don't trust anyone around, can't stand you Ain't gonna stick around I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)\" Jack started to sing along with it. i sighed dreamily at his voice, every girl would KILL to be here where I am. \"now turn right, wai WAIT! No this street over here!\" he said. \" I think it IS right, moron\" I laugh. He scoffed, then continued singing. I did as he told. We got to a bridge and slowed down, I was deathly afraid of bridges, especially in winter. I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell) I hate you, and I hate this town I mean you, and this pitiful town I hate you, you just make me laugh \"Just take it slow kid, and you'll be okay\" Jack reassured. \"okay\" I said weakly. I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell) I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell) I hate you, you like me? (No!) You like our music, now don't yah? (No!) It's such a pity now you want me to go! (Go! A lot of talk, not enough action Once I crossed the bridge I sped up a bit, wanting to get as far as possible. \"where are we?\" I asked, not recognizing the place. \"You'll see\" he said again. I rolled my eyes. Lot of lies, but no real reaction Lot of ways, but no real emotion We came across some abandoned houses, which by the way looked beautiful in the winter! \"we're almost there\" he said, smiling. I raised a brow, \" where are you taking me?\" I repeat my favorite question at this time. Jack picked back up into singing. I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell) I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell) I hate you, you like me? (No!) You like our music, now don't yah? (No!) It's such a pity now you want me to go! (Go!) Suddenly a deer came jumped in front of us, I screamed and swerved, while slamming the brakes, he was screaming at me to calm down and kept trying to take the wheel. I was crying and screaming back. We hit ice and like before, I flipped the car, and we rolled down the ditch. One… Two… \"Hey I need to tell you- Three.. -I've been meaning to say this but- Four.. Five…. \"I love you\" Six We rolled six times before crashing into a tree. I lifted my head off the steering wheel. I was soaked in blood, glass, snow and ice. I think I had a twig on me. I stared in horror at my secret love. He was covered in the same substances I was. I started to cry, \" im sorry Jack\" I whisper. He smiled back slightly, before moving closer to me, \"at least I to get to be with you\" \" I love you back\" I say. \" he smiled, and kissed me, I tasted blood and snow. Even though I was cold and hurt, I felt fire burn within me. A blazing hot fire, coursing within me. We continued kissing. Pouring gasoline onto the fire, making it burn, we wanted to feel the heat, we wanted to feel the smoke. We wanted to be burned. You're so pretty You're so pretty You're so fair Love your hair (ha ha ha) You're so pretty I wanted more, just one more kiss. I felt the fire instantly die. My face slammed against the steering wheel. With whatever strength Jack had left he grabbed my hand and laid his head on the dashboard. He cried softly to himself. \"It's never your fault. This was not your fault\" he whispered to my body. You're so pretty You're so pretty. Love your makeup Love your nose Love your eyes Love your clothes.. \" I love you…\" \"You're pretty useless!\" Omar screamed into the mic, slightly glancing at the pianist Angel. He jumped into the air strumming a few notes to his guitar. Dizzy shook his head, really guys? Can't we just get along? He thought to himself. Ever since Angel and Omar broke up things have been a bit hectic. Angel floated from guy to guy, while Omar became even colder than what he used to be. Stretch, the bassist tilted his head, still confused as to why the two ex-lovers were STILL fighting. It has to be at least 3 months now, right? Dizzy thought, as Angel glared at the fiery red head rocker. Dizzy shrugged as they finished the last part of the song. \"I hate you, and I hate this town I mean you, and this pitiful town I hate you, you just make me laugh I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell) I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell) I hate you, you like me? You like our music, now don't you? It's such a pity now you want me to go! I was born to raise hell...!\" Omar sang the last line with venom as he once again turned to Angel, who changed expressions as her new boy toy wandered in. Angel hopped off stage and into the arms of her new man, they kissed passionately before Omar butted in. \"That's it party's over! Get a room!\" he sneered. Angel turned back and stuck her tongue out. Dizzy sighed, wishing it went back to the days when they got along. The days when Omar and Angel were still together. When Omar was a bit nicer… Dizzy's phone vibrated, he checked it, Crista, his one year girlfriend. He smiled slightly before answering. Stretch smiled that even in all this chaos, his best friend, Dizz, still managed to find happiness. He then thought of his own girlfriend of five months, Lisa. He blushed just thinking about her. With her long brown hair, and big brown eyes that were hid behind a pair of glasses. To the gang she was a geek a nerd, but to him she was perfect. Pretty soon, like Dizzy, ignored the hatred amongst the band and found his place in happiness... tell me what you think :3 please![Chapter 2] One I woke up. I looked around me, I wasn't in the woods. I was by a fountain. There was no snow No broken glass No dead deer No blood No busted car No jack…. I frowned thinking about him. If im alive, maybe he is too. right? I sat up. Seeing my bass guitar sitting next to me. \"andy?\" I laughed at the name ive given it. he was red and white. I clutched the bass closer to me it smelt like jack. I buried my face into the coiled metal strings and wept. After the Practice Omar started to walk around. He was sick of Angel rubbing her new boys in his face. She sighed, I started singing to himself, but then stopped after he heard…crying? It sounded like someone was crying. He followed the sound around the fountain till he saw a girl, clutching an old school bass crying. He raised an eyebrow. She looked different. And not in the clothing. Something was off about her. But what? He looked closer, she had five fingers on each hand, when most people now days had four. Her ears were shaped different, and she defiantly didn't resemble an animal. He kept staring at her, she could be part mouse, or cat…something. Maybe rat? No he was part rat, he could tell if anyone else was. Omar didn't realize that the girl stopped crying.\" Haven't you seen a girl cry before?!\" he yelled. He blinked, once he realized she spoke to him. \"What are you?\" he asked, more to himself than anything. \"what the fuck does that mean?!\" she said, becoming angrier. \"You're not a rat, or a cat or a dog. I don't think you're any kind of animal truthfully\" he said, thinking aloud. I became confused, \"excuse me?! God forbid im not a fucking!\" I stopped once i got a good look at him. He was tall, a bit muscular, wearing jeans and a tanktop. Shoulder length fiery orange hair, brown eyes. She reminded him of Jack. He had a guitar strapped to his back, at least that's what I thought it was. It looked like a fancy shmancy guitar hero guitar. \"im human, what are you?\" I asked in a softer voice than what ive been giving him. \"humans don't exist\" he said, \"they all died, after world war 3\" I laughed, \"yeah, then maybe im a figment of your imagination\" He raised a brow, \"uh yeah\" \"well im looking at a ratman, and I swear I was in a truck with jack now im… im.\" I frowned. I thought of jack again. He must of known I was hurting because he sat down next to me, laying his guitar next to andy. \"you ok?\" he aksed. I nod, \"im fine\" I lied. I wasn't going to cry in front of a stranger. Thank you chocolate thunder for being the best ass mime coach ever. I thought, smiling fakely. \"whered you get this?\" he asked, changing subjects to my bass. \"karkrash and Bashy hooked me up with Andy for my 18th\" I said, nonchalantly. He stared at me like I told him I was God. \"who and what?\" he asked confussed I sighed, \"friends got it for my 18th birthday\" He nodded, \"may I?\" \"sure\" I shrug. He picked it up like a baby and fondled it, studying every part. I turned to his guitar…er guitar hero? I dunno. \"can I see your guitar hero guitar?\" I ask. \"what?\" he asked, turing to me. \"your guitar hero guitar? Yah know, for guitar hero?\" I say. \"whats guitar hero?\" he asked. \"a game, it's fake guitar with buttons and you pretend like youre in a band and-\" \"woah there. I AM in a band. And this is a REAL guitar.\" He says, being cocky. \"yeah, huh, cause guitars have buttons. This is a fucking bass! Its got strings and its legit. What do you do?\" I tease. He frowned. \"things improve\" \"but wheres the fun in practicing? Learning notes? How do you even play this anyway?\" I pick it up, and poking a few buttons. \"ill show you\" he says, snatching it from me. \"Well then give me Andy!\" I grab it from him. \"who?\" he asked. \"Andy, my bass\" I say, staring andy. \"you NAMED your bass?!\" he said, laughing. \"Shutup! Its my first bass. My true love man\" I say, feeling a sting of hippie creep up on me. \"yeah, okay\" he rolled his eyes. \"so how do you play your guitar hero?\" I ask. \"how do you play Andy?\" he teased back. \"ill show you if you show me?\" I offer. He paused, contemplating on letting a stranger touch his baby. \"sure\" I smile and hand him andy, who in return hands me his guitar. \"who are you by the way?\" I ask. \"Omar, you?\" he said, messing with my bass again. \"Cya\" [k-eye-uh] I say. \"cool name\" he said, smirking at me. \"yours too\" I say And for one moment I wasn't thinking about Jack.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 3 Angel sat on the couch. She sighed. She felt slightly bad for shoving her new boyfriend in his face but he deserved it after what he put her through! After the mok concert he had screaming girls chasing his ass all over the place. Everytime she opened a window or a door, a mob of horny teenage girls stood in line to get into his pants. She rolled her eyes. he thought that after going across the states to rescue her he would be more…oh what was it? loving? Compassionate? That he would kiss her in front of those girls, and say proudly that angel was his and his alone. No other man or girl could tear them apart….except fame… or his pride. He was cocky before yeah, and she loved that, but now….now he was too cocky. It got to the point he thought he was tops and we should worship him. \"everything alright sweetie?\" her boyfriend, rick , walked in handing her a glass of wine. \"yeah, I just feel bad about omar\" she frowned. \"hey, hey. HE was the one who screwed up. You weren't happy with him and you deserve better\" he said softly, hugging her. \"I know. I just wish he'd fall for someone else, ya know?\" she said, taking a sip. \"yeah, I know. You know you're such a …angel, angel\" She laughed, \"I know\" Dizzy was waiting for crista. He was leaning against the lamp post, hands shoved in his coat pockets. [finish later sorry! have lines to memorize XD][Chapter 4] Chapter 4 i went home to my apartment and slept. i wokeup the next day, remebering everything that happend that night. i sighed, i wish every night could be like that. someone knocked on the door. i hopped out of bed and walked over, still sleepy and opened the door. i didnt see anyone. i looked around. no one. something caught my eye. a note. it was a white card with shiney gold lettering \"wont you join me for a spell?\" i read aloud, \"mok\" is that the same crazy rock star that tried to take over the world? or is he someone diffrent? i shrugged and went back in and got ready for the day. \"..and then Stretch fell down the staires!\" Dizzy said, causing everyone to laugh. we decided to take a vaction and head down to Nuke York for a few days or so. we were sitting at Aunt Eidth's tattoo shop, having a personal day. Dizzy and Stretch were telling stories about thier childhood together. Aunt Eidth was giving a tattoo Angel was sitting on the floor, texting her boyfriend. Dizzy and Stretch were sitting on the worn out couch Omar was sitting on the window sill and i was sitting on the floor. \"I remember when that little squirt came\" Aunt Eideth said, point to me. \"what?\" i say, \"yeah, one year ago you was at my doorstep. i took ya in and i never rereget it to this day. you was one fine artist girl\" she smirked. \"you draw?\" Omar asked, smiriking at me. \"yeah, but i was sixteen and-\" \"And one of the best damn sixteen year old artists out there\" she said. \"there you go doll, the ladies will love it\" she set down her tools and wiped off any exess ink. the man stood up, payed her and left. \"you still have any drawings?\" Stretch asked. she nodded, \"yeah, i aint getting rid of them. hold on\" she went to the back room and appeared five minutes later. in her hands were a few portrats of people. \"so these are humans huh?\" Omar asked. i nodded \"yeah\" they were portrats of people laughing, smiling, crying, running, walking, anything really. one drawing caught Omars eye... it was of a band, in worn, ripped, bloody clothing. they were wearing masks and held instruments. they were standing in some sort of a abandoned setting. \"whats this one?\" He asked, showing it to me. \"oh, that was a story i was writing back when. had over 200 pages written. it was about a world with no art or music.\" i say. he nodds,\" must of been one sick story\" i laugh, \"it was, EVERYONE wanted to read it. it was good.\" the day went by fast. just like the concert. When we got back to Aunt Eidths house, we realized one problem. she didnt have enough space. and people would have to share rooms. oh joy... we all debated on what to do and we came up with this: Aunt Eidth gets her room obviously.. Stretch and Dizzy get the bunk beds haha Angel got the small bedroom and i got the couch. but guess where Omar was sleeping? with Angel of course... i sighed. i was in my pjs and layed on the couch. Aunt Eidth walked by, in her nightgown. \"sorry kid, id have you with Omar but then none of us would get to sleep\" she winked at me. i laughed, \"yeah and what would we do? party all night?\" \"Not the kind of dancing i was thinking of\" she said my face turned red \"really Auntie? REALLY?\" she laughed, \"really. now i dont know about you, if i was in your situation id take the chance.\" \"take what chance?\" Omar said, walking from the hallway. \"to go dancing\" Aunt Eidth said, dancing a little. Omar laughed, \"okay\" \"well, im going to head for bed, it was a long day for me\" she winked at me again and left. \"what was that all about?\" He asked, pointing behind him. \"Lets just say its not the kind of dancing she made it seem\" i say, laughing. he sat next to me on the couch.\"well then, what kind of...\" he trailed off. his face turned red. \"get it?\" i ask. he nodded, \"thats why she put you on the couch?\" \"yeah\" i say, my face turing crimson also. he laughed, \"yeah cause im totally gunna do it when everyones here\" \"so you would do it with me?\" i teased. he skoffed, \"yeah uh huh\" i frown. he poked my nose again, just giving ya shit.\" i smile, \"why do you always do that?\" \"do what? give you shit? cause i can and its fun\" he said. i shook my head, \"no, why do you poke me?\" he shrugged, \"cause its fun\" \"youre weird\" i say \"not as weird as you\" he smirked \"pfft. who has that natural orange of hair?\" i joke he laughed, \"its pretty awesome\" \"yeah uh huh\" i laugh i stick my hands into my hoodie and realize i still had that card. i pull it out. \"where did you get that?\" Omar asked, changing tones to a more serious one. \"it was on my doorstep, why?\" i ask innocently. \"that was the bastard who took angel and tried to kill us all\" he said. \"r-really?\" i ask, in shock. he nodded \"yeah\" \"im not gunna see this creeper, promise\" i say trying to reasure him. he smiled at me, \"i know you wont, i wont let you\" he kissed my forehead and stoodup, \"night baby doll.\" and he was gone... well is it good so far? tell me please![Chapter 5] Chapter 5 the next morning: i was up before everyone else, except Aunt Eidth, she normaly got up this morning. \"morning\" i say, yawning and sitting down at the bar stool. \"mornin'\" she said back.\"so ive got a question for ya\" \"shoot\" i say, combing my messy hair down with my fingers. \"ive got this new idea for a tattoo, and i needs your help on this one\" she said, getting a mischevious grin. i raise an eyebrow, \"uh huh\" \"well, ya know how wedding rings are getting expensive and most people are into rock these days?\" she asked i nodded \"well, i was thinking, id be pretty cool if instead of rings, it was tattoos. and its a desgin, one person gets one half, the other gets the rest, got it?\" she said. \"ok, but if i get -\" Thanks hun! ill grab my kit!\" she interupted me and was gone... by noon everyone else was up. i was sitting on my make shift bed, a.k.a the couch. Stretch and Dizzy sat next to me, looking tired. \"you guys slept longer then me, why are you tired?\" i ask \"Omar and Angel were arguing most of the night\" Dizzy said, rubbing his eyes. \"really?\" i ask, intrigued. \"yeah, all they did was yell back and forth about..\" Stretch trailed off. \"about what? tell me!\" i huffed. Dizzy nudged me as a tired Omar and Angel came out. \"about what?\" i whispered to Stretch. \"about thier past relationship, her new boyfriend, and you\" Stretch whispered back. \"me? why me? i aint dating anyone\" i say. \"exactly, she thinks you and omar are 'cause youre so lovey dovey with eachother\" Dizzy whispered i wish , i thought to myself. \"him and i are just good friends, thats all, god she left him, so what does she care?\" i say, a little defensive. \"i dunno\" Stretch shrugged, and went to the kitchen for food, Dizzy and Angel followed, leaving me and Omar once again. \"so how did you sleep?\" i teased. he shook his head, \"dry up kid\" he called me kid when he was mad. \"calm your face, im just messing with you, how bad was it?\" i ask. \"the female version of Mok and i had a sleepover.\" he said. \"that bad huh?\" i say, sitting up. he nodded and sat next to me, \"uh huh\" \"so Aunt Eidth has this idea to-\" \"im ready!\" Aunt Eidth called from her bedroom. \"what the hell?\" Omar asked, looking at me funny. \"its not what you think! god youre so wierd\" i say standing up. \"not as weird as you\" he responds. \"orange hair!\" i shout \"human girl!\" he shouts back. i laugh and go to her bedroom. \"ow!\" i say, as she poked an ink filled needle in my wrist. \"almost done!\" she said, setting the needle down.\"there! perfect,and it is one hell of a job i must say\" \"its pretty rad\" i say, picking up some of omars words. \"yeah it is.\" she beamed. it was some sort of black vine like design, with a half of a white star on the side. \"what about the other half?\" i ask. \"its the same thing, except the vines are white, and the star is black.\" she said, cleaning off her needle. \"who gets the other half?\" i ask, curiosity getting the better of me. \"ehh ill think of someone\" she smirked, \"now, you cant show it to anyone, cover it with all those braclettes you wear or a sleeve or something. and no one can know.\" she said. \"what about the other person?\" i ask. \"they cant say either\" smirked, \"now, off you go\" she pushed me out the door. well then... later in the evening i decided to take a walk. i ran into some chick on rollar skates. \"hey doll, sorry about that- hey! youre that human chick! youre apart of that rock band!\" she squealed. \"yeah i am\" i say, sheepishly. \"im Cindy, wanna go dancing?\" she asked i nodded \"yeah, sounds fun\" i say \"great, come on toots, we i know the perfect place\" she grabbed my hand and we headed off. we appeared at some place called Club 666. wow... \"we got this\" she grabbed my hand and lead me in. it was packed, full people drinkers, druggies, dancers. \"i got us a booth over here\" she said. \"isnt it like taken?\" i ask, pointing to the scrawny guy sipping his beer. she winked at me, \"not for long\" we went over there, the music was to loud so i couldnt really hear what she was saying, but all i knew it was something to deal with dancing and drinks. the guy moitned us to sit, and we did. Cindy leaned over, \"hes gunna get us some drinks\" i laughed, Cindy knows how to work the system. the guy came back with our drinks and we sat there talking with him, well more like Cindy and the guy flirted MAJORLY with eachother. some techno song came on and she stood up, \"thats my jam doll! watch this!\" i watched as she took the skinny guy and they danced. i laughed, note to self, call cindy in case of extreme Omaranitis, shes got the meds for that. after the song she kept introducing me to all these guys. my mind said take them, but my heart said Omar. why is my mind disagreing with my heart? and why is my heart disagreing with my mind? whatever... i talked with them, just to make her happy. I could tell Cindy was really trying to get me a guy. she pulled me over to the dance floor and we started dancing. Cindy leaned down and whisperd in my ear, \"theres some hottie over there checking you out\" she giggled. \"where?\" i ask, looking around. \"over there\" she pointed to a tall, muscular guy, in his early twenties, baggy green pants, combat boots, a black tank top, and an arm guard. not to mention his firey orange hair, the only kind of hair that only Omar had... i got a better look at him... it was Omar..[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 tell me what you think :) we walked over to eachother and met halfway. \"hey,what the hell are you doing?\" he asked, calmly. \"dancing with Cindy, you?\" i asked, trying to act cool. he shrugged, \"eh, i followed you\" i burst out laughing, \"crepper much?\" he laughed, \"yeah, well, i didnt want any creepy rockstars come by and take you\" i shook my head, \"why are you always this protective, huh?\" he poked my nose again, \"cause i can be\" Cindy rolled over on her skates, \"awh aint that cute, now go dance!\" she gushed, pushing me and Omar on the dance floor. \"i cant dance!\" i yell at her \"hey what the hell?\" he yelled. \"just dance!\" she called, turing to some new guy. i shook my head, \"crazy\" \"i know right?\" he said. we both just stood there, really confused.. \"this next song is a slow one, so grab a partner and slow down those moves guys\" the dj called, and switched records to some slow song. i sighed, bad timing... \"this is wierd\" he said, looking around. i nodded, \"very\" \"awh, looks like we got ourselves a shy couple, lets give them a little spot light\" the dj said. then this light shined on us. oh dear god... \"awhh dude, look at that girl, and girl, look at that dude. youre standing here on a dance floor, with other couples, now i suggest you dance.\" he said.

As Migo was carefully walking alongside the Yak Shak curiously looking into the windows (luckily nobody saw him), he suddenly heard a goat from behind him. Migo turned to see the small creature, but when it saw his face, it started screaming. Migo quickly shushed at it with a finger in front of his mouth to try to make it stop. And finally it stoped screaming, and then started to chew on a tiny shoe. \"Hey, what've you got there?\" Migo asked as he walked towards the little goat, taking a closer look at what it was chewing on. \"Shh, it's okay.\" Migo gently stroked the goat and pulled the shoe right out of it's mouth. Looking at the tiny piece of clothing, it had the shape of a small foot so he placed it next to his own foot to see the size difference, seeing his foot being way bigger than the shoe, he knew it came from a Smallfoot. \"I must be close.\" Migo said. Then the door of the Yak Shak shot open, surprised, Migo turned, and he saw... a Smallfoot! \"There it is!\" Migo whispered. That was when Percy appeared, walking out of the Yak Shak and making a call. \"I should introduce myself. Oh goodness, why am I so scared?\" Migo whispered to himself, not knowing what he was gonna say to him. \"Please, dad. I just need a little more money till I get my show back on track!\" Percy said into his phone, without knowing that a yeti was standing only a few feet away from him. Migo was for some reason expecting them to speak the same language, so he wasn't that surprised that he could understand what he said, but he was wondering why the Smallfoot said that just out of nowhere, since he was the only Smallfoot to be seen at the moment, not knowing about phones at that time. \"Fine, just leave me completely broke here in the Himalayas, that's fine.\" Percy said most definitely being sarcastic, he hang up on the phone, putting it back into his pocket. As soon as he did that, he saw two, gigantic, blue feet in front of him. Slowly looking up, he saw a huge body covered in the whitest fur he had ever seen, and slowly he was making his gaze up to the yeti's face, which was smiling widely down at him showing his big, sharp teeth nearly sticking out of his mouth. Percy couldn't believe what he was looking at, he gasped as his heartbeat was now faster and shorter than ever. \"It's a yeti, it's a yeti, it's a yeti...\" Percy whispered while the humongous yeti took Percy's breath away, he was terrified. Migo then bend down to the Smallfoot, putting his hands on his legs, still holding him up. \"Hi, little guy.\" Migo suddenly said with a friendly voice, Percy's eyes widened even more, he was frozen in place. He just heard a yeti talk to him! Overwhelmed, Percy's eyes rolled back in his head and he fainted. Migo quickly got a worried look on his face, and went down on his knees to try to figure out what was going on with him. \"Uh, Smallfoot? Hello?\" Migo carefully turned the little guy's head with one finger, to see if he was damaged in any way, but Migo didn't see anything. Then a short, cold wind blew into Migo's fur, alarming him that a blizzard was about to hit them soon. He looked back down at the unconscious Smallfoot, he couldn't just leave him there when a huge blizzard was coming, and he also had to take him to his village. So he scooped Percy up in his arms and ran to a big and dry cave nearby, (with no bears) and was planning to keep the little guy there until the storm passed. When he was all the way into the cave, he gently put the still sleeping Smallfoot down on the ground. \"Don't worry, you're safe here, nice and warm.\" Migo said gathering some nearby sticks and placing them next to Percy, then Migo noticed that the little guy was shivering as he was lying down on the freezing rock ground. Migo was quick to pick him up again to keep him from freezing to death, then he noticed something falling out of the little guy's backpack as he got picked up. It looked like some sort of cocoon (which was a sleeping bag), it was the size of the Smallfoot, anyway. Then Migo got an idea, he put him inside the 'cocoon' so he would be kept warm. Migo then took a rock that was a little bigger than Percy, placed it next to the sticks he'd gathered and then laid the Smallfoot on top of the rock so he wouldn't just sleep on the ground. After that Migo found two small rocks and banged them into each other, making them create sparks. A few minutes later, Percy began to feel warm, really warm. As he started to wake up he saw a campfire in front of him, burning brightly, warming him up easily. \"Ah, fire. So warm, so nice.\" Percy mumbled. \"You like that, little guy?\" Percy suddenly heard, looking around confused for a few seconds, he saw the yeti next to the fire at Percy's foot end, looking and smiling down at him. Percy screamed in horror, wiggling and squirming to get out of the sleeping bag. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! NO, NO, NO!\" Percy screamed as he got out of the sleeping bag and now crawled as fast as he could away from Migo, looking horrified up at him. Migo started walking towards the terrified little guy. \"No, no! It's okay, I don't wanna hurt you!\" Migo said trying to calm down the Smallfoot. Again, Percy's eyes got wider as he heard the yeti speak to him. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\" Percy screeched, overwhelmed by the fact that a yeti just talked to him. Once again, Percy felt his eyes getting weaker as they were slowly rolling back in his head, about to make him pass out again. Migo noticed the dizziness that the little guy felt, and was quick to catch him before passing out completely. \"Oh no, please don't faint again.\" Migo begged as he was gently lifting the Smallfoot a little with his big hand. Percy quickly came to his senses again and, again, again, screamed and crawled backwards as fast as possible when he realized that the yeti was holding him, and had brought him so close to his enormous, intimidating face. When Percy panicked Migo quickly moved his hand away, he figured that the Smallfoot wanted to keep a bit of distance for now, at least until they knew each other a little bit more. By now Percy had hit the end of the cave, he was cornered, there was no escape. Percy brought up his hands and feet in front of him, defensively trying to protect himself while wheezing, trying to catch his breath. As Migo was getting closer to him, and Percy couldn't get farther away from him, all he could do was to hope that it would all go away. \"PLEASE!\" Percy begged, \"DON'T HURT ME!\" Migo heard the horror in the Smallfoot's voice as he said that. He suddenly backed away a little and sat down on his knees a few feet away from Percy. \"Hey, don't worry.\" Migo said with a concerned yet gentle voice, \"I'm not gonna hurt you.\" Percy's eyes slowly opened up looking at the yeti's concerned face, Migo leaned forward, and made Percy flinch. \"NO, NO, NO, S-STAY BACK! PLEASE!\" Percy stuttered now pulling his knees to his chest as he sat sideways against the stone wall and holding out one hand to signal Migo not come any closer. As he did, he accidentally scraped his right leg against the hard rock floor, causing a big, painful scar to open on his knee. Migo gasped as he saw the little guy get hurt that easily, he was a fragile little creature. \"Ahhh!\" Percy cried out in pain as he was holding his wounded leg tightly. It tore Migo apart seeing his little Smallfoot in so much pain, he had to help him! Migo looked around searching for something that could make the little guy feel better. After a few seconds he spotted a rock that had the shape of a rock fruit, he knew that it's jell could heal Percy's wound because Migo's father used to lubricate the rock fruit jell over his wounds and they went away after like 10 minutes. He was quick to grab it and pull it to him, using his head to crack it open. The yeti gently grapped the Smallfoot's hurt leg (not on the wound, of course) and carefully pulled it to him so he could see it clearly, it didn't look good, not good at all. Migo's eyes widened when he saw the little guy have such a deep wound. \"AAAAAHHHHH! NO, NO, NO, PLEASE!\" Percy tried to pull his leg away from the yeti, but Migo wouldn't let him. \"Shh, easy, little guy. It's okay, calm down.\" Migo said gently patting Percy's head with one of his fingers, of course Percy didn't quite enjoy that, so he pulled his head back. Migo then dipped his finger in the jell and moved it close to Percy's wound. \"W-What is that?! What are you doing?!\" Percy asked while panicking and, again, trying to pull his leg away. \"Hey, don't worry. Just sit still for a minute, okay?\" Migo said as reassuringly as possible. Percy still wasn't so comfortable with Migo yet, so he closed his eyes tightly and prepared himself for the worst. The yeti then lubricated the Smallfoot's wound with the rock fruit jell as carefully as he could. It didn't take long before he was done. \"There, see? You're okay.\" Migo said with a calming voice, gently letting go of the little guy's leg. \"Just give it 10 minutes, and you should feel much better.\" Migo said smiling down at Percy. The Smallfoot looked at the jell Migo had put on his wounded knee, it didn't hurt as much as he thought it would, he could even feel it slowly getting better already. He looked up at the yeti and saw the concerned and compassionate look in his eyes. He was very surprised but also thankful, but he chose to ask him some of the questions he had for him before trusting him too much. \"H-How... can you... talk?\" Percy then asked shaking a little bit. \"I... don't know, I guess I just... can.\" Migo answered without having thought about why he was able to talk. Migo looked back down at the Smallfoot who still had a scared look on his face, Migo began to feel bad about himself, he only wanted the best for the Smallfoot, he wanted the little guy to feel safe with him. \"Okay, looks like we got off on the wrong foot, let's start over.\" Migo cleared his throat and sat down in Indian style. \"Hi Smallfoot, I'm Migo.\" Migo said with a friendly smile, Percy though got a confused look on his face. \"Smallfoot?\" Percy asked very confused. \"Did you just call me... Smallfoot?\" \"Oh, did I... offend you by calling you that?\" Migo asked sounding as apologizing as possible. But Percy wasn't offended, he was just confused. \"N-no.\" He answered still shaking a little. \"Uh, y-you're not... gonna eat me, or anything... are you?\" Percy asked a little worried of what he was going to answer. \" Eat you?! No! Why would I eat you?!\" Migo said while being shocked that he would think he would do such a thing. Percy gulped nervously before answering. \"Well, b-big... creatures like you n-normally... eat or... kill small creatures l-like me.\" Percy tried to explain while stuttering, trying not to offend the yeti. Migo was in shock, of course the little guy would feel threatened by him, he was a lot bigger than the Smallfoot, and he didn't have any horns or sharp teeth to defend himself with, no wonder he would be afraid! \"I-I'm sorry for making you think that, I didn't mean to scare you so much.\" Migo apologized still shocked that he had made him think that he would hurt, or possibly kill him. But Percy was still not sure why he was in the cave. \"Why did you b-bring me in here?\" he asked, \"What do you want with me?\" Migo then finally got a chance to explain the whole situation, so that's what he did. \"I promise, I'm not gonna hurt you. I just need to take you home, and prove to everyone that you exist, so I can get un-banished.\" Migo explained, \"Look, I saw another one of your kind up in the mountain where my kind live, but you are known to only exist in legend, so the others didn't believe me, and I got banished because they thought that I lied about it. So I went down here to find a real Smallfoot and bring one up the mountain so they could see that I told the truth and not be banished anymore.\" Percy was left with his eyes wide open, not sure what to say. He understood that he didn't want to be banished and everything, but Percy still wasn't sure if he could trust him, I mean, he had just met him and thought that he was gonna eat him. \"I never meant to do anything bad to you, I promise. I just need to take you up the mountain and show them that you exist, okay? I promise that I'll take you right back down after that.\" Migo promised to Percy who was still looking insecure and a bit unsafe, and he also noticed that the little guy was shivering a bit and his teeth were chattering. \"Are you cold?\" Migo asked attentively. \"J-Just... a little.\" Percy said barely being able to speak because of the cold. Migo could clearly see that he was lying, the yeti turned to look at the warm, cozy fire about 15 meters behind him and then looked back at the Smallfoot, it was now shivering even more, wrapping itself up with it's arms to keep itself warm, but was still freezing. Migo didn't like seeing him like that. \"Here, let's get you warmed up.\" Migo said while reaching out for Percy. \"Wait, what are you doing?!\" Percy asked pretty worried now as Migo was gently scooping the insecure Smallfoot up in his hands, carrying him over to the campfire to make him feel warm. \"It's okay, little guy. Just relax.\" Migo said reassuringly. As Percy realized that he was walking towards the fire, his eyes widened and he wiggled and squirmed trying to get out of the yeti's hands, he thought he was going to roast him for dinner. \"No! No, no, no!\" Percy yelled while flinching and struggling to get away from the fire, Migo quickly but gently put Percy down onto the rock he was sleeping on before, right next to the fire. Percy slowly opened his eyes as he realized he was placed next to the fire instead of in it. As cold as Percy was at the moment, he quickly got comfortable with the fire and let out an 'ahh' in relaxation. \"There you go,\" Migo said calmly looking down at Percy, \"That should keep you nice and warm.\" Percy looked up at Migo and smiled slightly. \"Thanks.\" Percy said as he warmed himself up by the warm and toasty fire, no longer shivering. Though there was something Percy had to know as Migo kept trying to help him. \"Why are you being so nice to me?\" Percy asked the yeti, Migo looked at him as if that was the stupidest thing anyone had asked him. \"Well, I couldn't just let you sit there shivering with an open wound.\" Migo responded which left Percy quiet for a moment, surprised that the yeti actually cared about him. \"You said your name was... Migo, right?\" Percy said smiling up at the yeti. Migo then turned to face the Smallfoot and nodded. \"Yeah, that's my name.\" Migo said smiling back at Percy, \"What's your name?\" Migo then asked. \"I'm Percy.\" the Smallfoot said with a friendly voice. Migo had never heard that kind of name before, he was truly amazed. \"Percy...\" Migo whispered to himself, \"That's a really cool name! Pleased to meet you, Percy.\" Migo said as he held out his finger to shake Percy's hand, Percy tried to figure out why he held out his finger at him, like he was pointing at him. Finally he realized what he was trying to do, so Percy took out his hand and gently shook the yeti's finger up and down. \"Pleased to meet you too, Migo.\" Percy said with a genuine smile on his face this time, then turned his face to the fire, focusing on keeping himself warm. Migo studied him as he did that, he was so happy to see that Percy was no longer afraid of him. \"How are you doing?\" Migo asked attentively, wanting to make sure that the little guy was comfortable. \"I'm doing just fine.\" Percy said all calm and relaxed, \"The warmth is very nice.\" Migo noticed that warmth was very important to the Smallfoot, and the yeti knew that he had to remember that to keep him satisfied and happy. Migo turned his gaze outside the cave and realized that the blizzard had passed. \"Oh, the storm has lifted!\" Migo cheered, \"What do you say me and you get up that mountain and prove you exist?\" he asked Percy. The Smallfoot's smiling face suddenly turned into a worried expression as the yeti said that, Percy looked outside trying to decide if he should go with Migo or go back to the human village. After a short moment of silence, Percy looked at his leg that had been damaged, but then realized that it wasn't damaged anymore, it was all gone just like Migo said it would be. But it had barely been 5 minutes since Migo put the jell on his wound, maybe it worked faster on Percy because there wasn't as much skin to grow back as there was on the thick skin of the yetis, even if his wound was really deep. There was no proof that he had been damaged, anyway. From that moment, Percy knew he could trust Migo. \"And you promise that you'll take me right back down after that?\" Percy asked sounding very serious. \"I promise.\" Migo said with a reassuring and warm voice. \"And... the other yetis... they're not gonna hurt me either, right?\" Percy asked with a little worry in his voice. \"They won't, don't worry. You'll be completely safe.\" Migo said with a warm smile. At that moment, Percy finally made his decision. \"Okay, I'll do it.\" Percy said, which Migo was very happy to hear. \"Great, let's get you up there then.\" Migo said wearing a big smile. \"But, how ?\" Percy asked before seeing Migo tying up the sleeping bag with some rope from Percy's backpack, and then strapping it onto his chest. \"Like this.\" Migo said pointing at the sleeping bag, gesturing for Percy to come inside of it before offering his hand to Percy so he could lift him up to the sleeping bag. Percy started gathering the things that had fallen out of his backpack, and then swung it onto his back. \"Alright, here goes nothing.\" Percy said to himself while climbing onto Migo's hand, letting the yeti hoist him up to his chest to the sleeping bag, Percy then slid himself into it. \"Oh, I almost forgot.\" Migo said and then grabbed some smoldering rocks from the fire. \"Here, these should keep you warm.\" Migo said before dropping them into the sleeping bag. \"No! No, no, no!\" Percy yelled while flinching of the idea of the hot rocks, but as the rocks touched his cold feet, he quickly realized that they were warm and toasty. \"Ahh,\" Percy said in relaxation, \"That's actually quite nice.\" he remarked, Migo couldn't help but chuckle a little when Percy said that. Migo tightened the rope so his friend wouldn't just blow away as they went up the mountain. Migo and Percy were now making their way up the mountain, to the yeti village. As they came to a an area where there was a huge split between two tall hills on the mountain where there could've easily been about the quarter of a mile between at least, Migo just jumped over to the other hill without even dropping a sweat. Percy couldn't possibly be anything but amazed by that! \"We're almost there.\" Migo said to Percy reassuringly.[Chapter 2] Hey guys, I'm finally back! Sorry for all the wait, I'll try my best to keep this updated monthly. Migo and Percy were now inside the clouds as they were making their way up the mountain. Migo checked on Percy every few minutes making sure he was okay, by now the Smallfoot was sound asleep as the yeti kept climbing up the mountain carefully now that he had a sleeping Smallfoot on his chest. Migo smiled down at the sleeping little guy, his snoring was so quiet that Migo sometimes thought that he had been blown away by the wind or something. The yeti thought Percy looked so cute when he was just hanging there, sleeping quietly, peacefully even. He let him sleep until they got to the others. Finally they made it above the clouds, but Migo saw that the S. E. S. was about a mile to his right with Meechee hanging over the edge of the mountainside. He didn't really know what to think, other than that it wouldn't be worth it if they dropped her down now that Migo was above the clouds again. He didn't know how long they had her hanging like that and Migo didn't want to waste any time, so he started waking Percy up by carefully shaking him awake. \"Percy. Percy, wake up.\" Migo whispered to the Smallfoot, Percy's eyes then started to open as he was waking up. \"Did you have a nice nap?\" Migo asked smiling down at Percy. The first thing Percy saw when his eyes opened was the yeti's smiling face, and somehow, Migo's face was the most reassuring and calming thing Percy could have seen at that moment. He smiled back at the yeti. \"Yes, I did.\" Percy responded. He quickly realized that the belongings were different, though. \"Is this the place?\" Percy asked Migo. \"Yes. Are you ready?\" Migo asked hoping that he was. Percy still had some doubt inside of him, but he chose to ignore it for now. Since Migo had helped him so much, the least Percy could do was return the favor. \"I'm ready.\" He said. Migo then smiled down at Percy once again, still very thankful for his decision to go with him. Migo then turned his gaze to the S. E. S. and then jumped up, waving his hands wildly trying to get their attention. \"Guys!\" Migo yelled out to them, they didn't seem to notice him though, so he tried again. \"Guys!\" he yelled a little louder now, seeming to have caught Meechee's attention. She pointed at Migo in excitement, making the rest of the S. E. S. turn around and spot him. Migo then ran towards them still with one hand in the air to make sure they knew it was him. \"Migo!\" They all said surprised that he was even alive. Though Gwangi accidentally let go of the rope that was holding Meechee up over the mountainside when he saw Migo, causing her to fall down (obviously). He was quick to grab the rope and pull it up again though, but he pulled so hard that it caused Meechee to fly up into the sky (not literally). As she was falling down again Gwangi ran side to side hoping he'd catch her. \"I've gotcha!\" Gwangi said. Meechee though landed perfectly fine on her hands and legs right next to Fleem, who was cowering not wanting to get squished by Meechee. She then ran over to Migo and hugged him. \"Migo! I'm so relieved!\" She said. \"Oh, hi!\" Migo responded hugging her back for a quick moment but then let go again, trying to act casual, Meechee did the same. \"See? I told you he was alive.\" Fleem said, though everyone knew he was lying. Then Gwangi and Kolka joined the hug. \"My brother!\" Gwangi said to Migo as his arms was all around him and Meechee. \"Oh, Migo!\" Kolka said as she was also hugging them. Though when Migo looked down he realized that Percy was getting squished by all the hugging. \"Woah, woah guys! Easy, easy!\" Migo said causing them to back off as Migo held the little guy close to him to protect him from being squished too hard, he was a very fragile little creature. They others then noticed the gray cocoon looking thing Migo had strapped onto his chest. \"What is that?\" Kolka asked pretty worried of what could be inside. \"Smallfoot Evidentiary Society,\" Migo began as he unstrapped Percy from his chest. \"Meet your mystical creature.\" Migo laid Percy down on a flat rock in front of the other yetis. Percy was pretty nervous of meeting the yetis, but he snapped out of it, swallowed the fear and started wiggling his way out of the sleeping bag, he knew it was to late to back out. The S. E. S. was very excited to see what kind of creature Migo had brought up the mountain (Well, all of them but Fleem). Finally, Percy got out of the sleeping bag, revealing most of his body to the yetis. They were all stunned by the fact that it was a real Smallfoot, and Percy was stunned by the fact that he was standing (well, sitting ) face to face with four more yetis! \"I knew it was real.\" Meechee said almost crying of happiness. \"No one's gonna think I'm crazy anymore!\" Gwangi said wearing a big smile, showing his huge teeth. \"He is so beautiful!\" Kolka wheezed in excitement, admiring the looks of the little creature. \"And so short!\" Fleem said, finally meeting a creature that was smaller that him. \"Guys, this is Percy.\" Migo said introducing his new friend to the S. E. S., Percy then waved with a slight smile. \"Hi...\" Percy said nervously. The others were now even more amazed now that they heard that the could Smallfoot talk. \"He can talk?!\" Kolka asked stunned by the fact that the creature actually had language skills. Fleem then suddenly picked him up and started shaking him. \"Fear me, little creature! I am your god!\" Fleem yelled putting Percy down and raised his hands in the air dominantly, causing Percy to slowly back away from him. \"Fleem, what are you doing?\" Kolka asked. \"Establishing dominance.\" Fleem answered, and it seemed to work since Percy was still backing away. \"No!\" Kolka told Fleem while picking Percy up to get him away from Fleem. \"We don't dominate. We welcome him, with open arms!\" Kolka placed Percy back down on the rock, but accidentally knocked him off of it again as she was waving her hands to the sides, motioning 'open arms'. \"Oh! Did I just do that?\" Kolka asked both sorry and surprised of her super strength compared to little Percy. She picked him up and pulled him into a hug. \"I'm so sorry, are you okay? Are you hurt?\" Kolka asked the Smallfoot with a baby voice, squishing his face with two giant fingers. \"I'm sorry, I love you. I love you.\" She said. Percy then got picked up by Gwangi. \"We gotta bring this truth to the village, blow some tiny minds.\" the big curly yeti said, motioning 'mind blow'. \"Wait, a whole village ?!\" Percy asked both worried and somehow amazed. Migo hadn't mentioned anything about a village, Percy thought he was talking about only a few yetis, not a whole freaking village ! Migo didn't think of that he had forgot to mention that part, he felt so guilty for not telling him all of it. \"Migo, didn't you tell him we had a village?\" Meechee asked wearing a 'how could you not have told him' look, her eyes pointing directly at Migo's. Migo though wasn't looking at Meechee, but at Percy. He felt so responsible for him not being fully aware of what he was deciding to do. \"Goodness, Percy I'm so sorry. I didn't think of that you didn't know we were going to our village.\" Migo apologized. Percy was surprised of how sorry Migo actually was, he had literally never seen a more sorry face in his life. \"It's alright, Migo. It's no big deal.\" Percy then said, leaving Migo with the surprised face. He had not expected Percy to forgive him so quickly. Kolka then wheezed of how cute Percy was as he forgave Migo. \"That's so cute!\" She said before grabbing him, and pulling him into another tight hug. Percy yelped as she suddenly picked him up and he got blue in the face when she squeezed all the air out of him. \"Woah, easy. Give him some space.\" Meechee said while carefully taking Percy out of Kolka's hands to let him breathe, and Percy also took a deep inhale as Meechee was holding him and placing him gently back down on the rock. \"You okay, Percy?\" Migo asked attentively. \"Yeah, never better.\" Percy said. Compared to the state of the Smallfoot, the others could sense that he was being sarcastic. Percy stood on his knees and hands still catching his breath after he had almost been strangled. Migo gently put his hand on Percy's back for support, casing Percy to look up at him. Migo smiled down at him with an 'It's okay, I'm here for you' expression on his face, which made a smile form on Percy's face as well. \"Percy, this is Meechee, Gwangi, Kolka and Fleem,\" Migo said as he gestured to each of the members of the S. E. S.. \"They're my friends.\" Percy thought those names were very peculiar, and he knew he wasn't going to remember any of them at first, but he'd try. \"Wow, those are some... interesting names.\" Percy said, causing almost all of them to chuckle (Fleem didn't chuckle, he just got offended). Meechee then tapped Migo's shoulder before tilting her head to the side to let him know that she wanted to talk to Migo in private. \"So, should we do it?\" Meechee asked in whisper, Migo got a worried look on his face when she asked that. He was starting to get second thoughts about taking him to the village, there was a big chance that the Smallfoot would get hurt again, even if it was on accident. Migo didn't want to see Percy like that again, especially not since he had promised to him that he wouldn't let him get hurt. \"Uh...\" \"Hey, guys!\" Gwangi interrupted, Migo and Meechee turned to face Gwangi, Kolka and Fleem. Kolka cooed at the Smallfoot while Gwangi held his bare foot. \"Check this out!\" The curly purple yeti said before he wiggled his finger against Percy's foot, causing him to squirm in hard laughter. \"Hey! Ahahahahaha! That t-hickles!\" Percy said while laughing hard, he tried to move his foot away but Gwangi wasn't gonna let him go, he had only just begun. \"He's ticklish!\" Kolka said in adoration, she soon joined in and wiggled her finger against Percy's stomach and sides, making him laugh even harder. \"No, no! St-hop it! Ahahahaha!\" Percy screamed in laughter as the yetis kept tickling him. Migo and Meechee thought he looked so adorable when he squirmed and laughed, having the time of his life. Migo had no idea that there was such a side of him, he loved seeing his Smallfoot be so happy. And seeing him like that in front of these curious, unpredictable yetis, made him think that taking Percy to the village wouldn't be such a bad idea after all. Though he could sense that the tickling was getting a little too much for Percy, so he walked over to the others and held his hands out motioning for them to stop. \"Okay, guys. I think he's had enough now.\" Migo said laughing slightly, then gently picking up the little guy. Percy yelped for a second, not expecting Migo to suddenly pick him up, but then looked up and saw another reassuring face from the yeti, slowly calming him down again. \"You ready, Percy?\" Migo asked motioning to the sleeping bag, Percy kept getting worried of the idea of meeting a village full of yetis, but he did know one thing; If anything went wrong, Migo would be there to protect him. Percy was gaining more and more of Migo's trust as every few minutes passed, he knew he could trust him enough to let him take him to who knows how many other yetis and still be safe as long as he was with Migo. \"Yeah, I am.\" Percy said, making Migo smile in gratefulness. He then stretched out the top of the sleeping bag, making the hole bigger so the Smallfoot could easily come inside of it. Percy then once again slid himself into the sleeping bag, though a pleasant surprise was at the bottom of it. \"Ahhh.\" Percy said as he got all relaxed, his feet had once again touched the toasty rocks at the end he had completely forgotten about. Though he was surprised that they were still hot. Migo looked down at the relaxed little guy, the yeti couldn't help but smile. He brought his finger to the Smallfoot's head, gently rubbing it like he was his pet. Percy felt a bit of embarrassment as he did that, but instead of complaining he laughed and shook his head. All of the yetis (plus Percy) then started making their way to the village, none of them could wait to show the amazing little creature they'd discovered. Sorry this chapter was pretty short but as I've said before; I've been working on a lot of stories this past month, and if you don't mind encounters, I might upload them later on, but for now I'm gonna focus more on this story. Sorry if you like this and are impatient but you'll just have to bear with me, it takes some time to write these and I hope you understand.[Chapter 3] Migo and his friends were making their way into the village, a lot of the yetis quickly noticed them. \"What? Migo's back?\" A yeti asked in the background, many of them gasped, they all knew he had been banished, so seeing him suddenly just walk into the village was very sudden and surprising. \"Yeah, that's right. In your face!\" Fleem said trying to both sound and look cool, but failed miserably when he tripped and fell on his face. \"Ow, my face!\" He shouted. \"Hey listen, everyone! Stop what you're doing and follow us!\" Migo yelled out to everyone in the village. \"This is gonna be the best part of your day!\" Meanwhile, Percy was strapped onto Migo's back and could hear everything they said, he didn't think being showed to the village would be that big of a deal to all of them. Sure Percy thought it was a big deal to him, because he was about to see a whole new world full of legendary creatures, but the fact that he would be the center of attention and that he himself was such a big thing to see, it was unbelievable. \"Hey, Migo! Welcome ba...\" Percy suddenly heard from not that far away it seemed, he got a little intimidated by the dark, rumbly voice and crept himself together for a moment, until he heard the next sentence. \"Hold on, aren't you supposed to be banished?\" The dark voice asked (it was Trorp). \"Yep.\" Migo responded, surprisingly sounding not the least bit intimidated or worried. \"Oh, cool.\" Thorp said, Percy was a little confused of what was happening, but he didn't think it was that important so he didn't think it was worth thinking that much about. After that Migo started talking, and by the sound of it, Percy would guess it was an announcement. \"Fellow yetis, behold... the Smallfoot!\" Migo shouted out to everyone as he pulled Percy out of the sleeping bag, holding him up so everyone could see him. He then pulled the little guy's boot off of his foot, showing it to all the yetis in the village, everyone gasped. They never thought such a creature existed, but now with it being shown right before their eyes, how couldn't they? Meanwhile, Percy was looking at the village in awe, he knew all along he was going to meet other yetis, but this was certainly not what he had imagined. \"I can't believe my eyes!\" Percy said amazed by, well... everything! \"These aren't primitive beasts living in caves, this is a complex civilization.\" Percy said to himself, hoping that the others didn't hear him, the last thing he wanted was to make a whole village full of yetis dislike him. Percy then grabbed his phone from his pocket, and started filming and taking pictures of the village. \"So,\" another voice suddenly said, everyone turned around to see that it was the Stonekeeper, standing at the entrance to the palace. \"What's all the excitement about this time?\" the Stonekeeper asked sounding like this was something Migo did all the time, and the Stonekeeper was getting really tired of. \"Migo found a Smallfoot!\" A yeti said from the crowd. \"Hmm, that's one guess.\" The Stonekeeper said lifting a shoulder in disagreement. \"But daddy, he has a small foot!\" Meechee then said walking up to Migo and Percy, gesturing to Percy's foot. Percy was starting to feel a little weird about this whole situation, it was a little uncomfortable for him to be the center of attention. \"Hmm, don't yaks have small feet?\" the Stonekeeper asked. Meechee sighed as her father kept disagreeing with them, Percy got pretty offended by the fact that that yeti had just called him a yak. \"What is this guy's deal?\" Percy thought, so far deciding that he didn't like that yeti. \"Do I really look like a yak?\" \"Let me take it into the palace, so we can find out what it is.\" the Stonekeeper said, Percy was getting worried of the thought of being alone with that guy, there was something about him that Percy didn't like, and so far he only really felt safe when he was with Migo. Also as Migo heard the Stonekeeper say that, he took one hand up in front of Percy protectively, wanting him to stay with him to make sure he was safe and secure. \"But what if it is a Smallfoot?! Does that mean a stone is wrong?!\" A yeti called Garry asked while panicking, making the whole village gasp (well, except for the S. E. S. and Percy of course). \"*cough* They're all wrong! *cough* *cough*\" Gwangi said from the crowd, which also made the whole village gasp. Percy was pretty confused at this point, what did they mean by 'stone'? Why was that yeti with the staff wearing a dress of rocks? Did they just really like rocks? Was it a religion thing? \"Garry, breathe. Everyone please, what did the stones tell us about questions?\" the Stonekeeper said, the whole village started breathing in deeply while bringing their hands to their chest with their palms upwards, but instead of taking them down again (\"pushing down their questions\"), they went over to Migo, Meechee and the Smallfoot, pouring out with questions. \"I have so many questions!\" Garry shouted desperately, actually wanting to know more about the Smallfoot. Suddenly Percy was placed on a big flat rock in the village, surrounded by curious yetis. \"Where is it from?\" \"Why is it pink?\" \"How did you get it here?\" \"What does it eat?\" \"How does it think with such a tiny little brain?\" There was so many questions that Percy could barely answer any of them before another question came up, so Migo did most of the talking. \"Honestly, I have just as many questions as you do.\" Migo said. A moment after, Percy was sitting on another stone, holding up a magazine, teaching more of the yetis how the human world actually worked. They were all very fascinated about all the stuff the humans had that the yetis had never thought of making. Suddenly, Percy was placed on Migo's shoulder as they were walking through the village, Percy of course was filming it all, there were so many things in the village that he had never seen before. It was all so new and strange and yet, Percy really liked it. \"Where is it's horns?\" \"Is that it's hair?\" \"Does it want a bite of fruit?\" \"How is it here if the stones says it can't be?\" Percy had heard a lot about 'the stones', but he still wasn't certain of what it was. He tapped Migo's shoulder, trying to get his attention. \"What is it with these 'stones' that everyone talks about?\" Percy asked in whisper. \"Well, we have these stones that our rules are written in, like... the one that says Smallfeet don't exist.\" Migo explained, Percy was gonna have to get used to them calling him Smallfoot because apparently that was what humans were known as up there. But that's not what threw Percy off, it was the fact that they had a rule that said that their kind didn't exist, Percy thought that was a weird thing to write in stone. \"Wait, what? There's a stone that says I don't exist?\" Percy asked both surprised and, again, confused. The way Percy said that made Migo think about it for a moment, he was starting to think it sounded strange as well. \"Well, yeah. But when you say it like that , it sounds pretty weird.\" Migo admitted, they both went quiet for a moment, thinking about that maybe the things written in those stones might not be meant to do anything that good for the village after all. Migo was especially confused at this point, it was their number one rule, something they'd been told for generations, and now the thought of that it wasn't even true made him think of how many of the rest of the stones that were actually telling the truth. He had never really thought of it that way, but now he was starting to have second thoughts about trusting the stones. It wasn't a long moment of silence before someone else started talking, though. \"What is he doing?\" \"Is he really gonna fly?\" Someone said, which made Percy and Migo turn around to see what was going on. Suddenly out of nowhere, they saw a yeti on the edge of a big rock that was wearing what looked like a hand-made hang glider. Percy got pretty worried for a second, they didn't even know how something like that precisely worked yet, it could easily just collapse at any moment. \"Uh, maybe that's not such a...!\" Before Percy could even finish the sentence, the yeti jumped off the high rock, Percy cringed expecting the yeti to immediately crash into something. But instead, the yeti gracefully soared around in the village. Percy was both surprised and amazed, it was literally just a some sticks and some fabric looking things that held him up, how could it carry a whole yeti so easily? Migo was absolutely stunned, what an amazing thing that thing was! He was also stunned by that the Smallfeet had created such a thing, it was amazing! A few minutes later Migo was hanging from a big ice cube on the Rope Transport, his hand sticking to it like glue. Percy was also sticking onto the ice cube, though pretty much his whole body was glued to it. The Smallfoot then waved with his leg to get Migo's attention, wanting to have a selfie with him. Migo still didn't quite get the idea of 'selfies', but he decided to just go with it since Percy seemed to think it was important. Then the ride came to their stop, and hot water was splashed both on Migo's hand, and also accidentally on Percy's entire body. Percy yelped as he fell to the ground like a raindrop (though luckily landed on his feet), and then started shaking, the hot water made him both burn and freeze at the same time. Migo of course, noticed immediately and got worried when he saw Percy like that, the yeti then got an idea. \"Come on, Percy. I know a quick way to dry you up.\" Migo said in reassurance as he held his hand out flat in front of Percy, wanting him to climb onto it. Slightly worried and confused he did so and ended up on Migo's shoulder. Not long after they were on a high hill, Migo had invited Meechee to come along with them and she gladly followed them. Percy was a little confused about what they were doing up there, and then suddenly Migo gently grabbed Percy and placed him on the back of his head, in a position where he was resting his hands on the yeti's horns. \"Hold on.\" Migo said looking up at his friend with an excited expression on his face. Those words made Percy a little more worried now, he didn't hesitate doing what Migo said though, surely he would've told him to hold on for a good reason. When Migo could tell that the Smallfoot had a good hold of his horns he started sliding down the hill through the village, with Meechee following close behind. Migo thought this would be a good way to both dry him up, show him the whole village and to just have some fun. Migo always slid down those hills to just have a fun time once in a while, and he wanted to share that same experience with Percy, he wasn't his prisoner after all, he was his friend. Percy let out a short yelp when Migo suddenly slid down, but a quick moment after, Percy started actually enjoying the ride, in fact, he thought it was really fun! Migo could tell that his Smallfoot enjoyed it, so he started sliding side to side, making the ride a little more exiting for the little guy who was already having so much fun as he was sitting on the yeti's shoulders, and could basically see the whole village from that height. Meechee watched them in amusement, both Percy and Migo was having such a blast together, and it looked like Migo's strategy was working; it dried Percy up, he got a good look at the village, and he was having fun. Though not for too long, Migo slipped suddenly, causing both Meechee and Percy to fall too. But when they landed, they all bursted out in laughter. When the laughter had died down, a mammoth suddenly came over, sniffing Percy's hair. Kind of scared of what it was, Percy turned to see the big mammal, but when it saw his face it got scared and started jumping on Percy. Percy screamed and cowared as the mammoth luckily didn't hit him, and when he got the chance, he didn't hesitate to try to get away from it. \"Blossom! Sit!\" Meechee said to her pet mammoth. Meanwhile Migo quickly took Percy up in his hand and scanned him for damages, and by the looks of it he had no visible damage, though he was of course close to (if he wasn't) traumatized. Migo then gently patted Percy on the head with two of his fingers, so he knew he was safe. \"I've got you.\" Migo reassured him in full concern, and surprisingly it didn't take long for Percy to calm down again. He was kind of getting used to Migo just being there for him when he needed him, it was actually kind of cute how the yeti cared about him so much. When Meechee had calmed her mammoth down (and scolded it), Migo moved Percy closer to it, so he could see that there was nothing to be afraid of. Though while the yetis only saw mammoths as pets, Percy had a completely different opinion. \"No, no, no, no! Don't...!\" Percy couldn't even finish the sentence before the mammoth (aka, Blossom) sniffed his face, making Percy yelp and cower in Migo's hands, frightened that Blossom would try to hurt him again. Though to Percy's surprise, Blossom suddenly grabbed him with her trunk and pulled him all the way up to her face so she could see him clearly, (she's really near sighted). When she had scanned him completely, she made happy mammoth noises, jumping in excitement and squeezed Percy hard while pressing him against her cheek, giving him a big and loving hug. Percy could sense that the mammoth really liked him, though her tight grip was making him go pale in the face. Migo of course noticed quickly, hurried over to his Smallfoot and gently grabbed him, letting him rest in the security of his hands, giving him a chance to catch his breath. \"I think she likes you.\" Migo said to Percy who was starting to look normal again. \"Oh, yeah. She's a cheeky one.\" Percy said surprised that such a big animal could be so cuddling, both Migo and Meechee laughed, and Percy couldn't help but laugh slightly with them. That's all for this chapter guys, sorry if the wait is too long, I am considering updating this more often than once a month now that there's not coming that many stories of this movie anymore (and some has been removed). But doing it monthly just gives me plenty of time to write a good chapter, it depends on how fast I come up with something to write for this story, really. Anyway, I hope this was worth reading and I'm hoping you'll stick around for the next chapter.[Chapter 4] GOOD NEWS!: As a reward for all of you who has been supporting my work and followed my story ( and convinced me to continue it), I have now uploaded 2 chapters! I don't want to say too much so... let's get on with the chapters! Enjoy! Migo and Percy continued walking through the village, with Percy sitting on Migo's shoulder, truly enjoying the sight seeing. Meechee has been called by her dad/the Stonekeeper to have a chat, so the male yeti continued on with showing the Smallfoot their wonderful world by himself, which he didn't have a problem with. As they were walking, they passed a few yeti children playing and running around about Migo's feet. Percy thought the small yetis were so adorable, he couldn't help but smile in adoration. \"Aw,\" Percy said, \"They're so cute.\" Migo couldn't hold back an adoring laugh as he heard his Smallfoot say that, which caused the children to look up at them. When they spotted the Smallfoot on Migo's shoulder, they all oohed in wonder at the new, tiny creature. Migo laughed once again, now gently grabbing Percy and lowering him down to the small yetis so he could greet them. \"Kids, this is Percy.\" Migo said holding the little guy in his hands in front of the yeti kids. They all waved at him. \"Hey, Percy!\" They all said while smiling at the Smallfoot. \"Hi.\" Percy said, waving and smiling back at them. The tiny yetis all gasped, even they were amazed by the fact that the new, strange creature could talk the same language as them. One of the children then grabbed Percy and pulled him into a tight and loving hug. Percy was surprised of how welcoming and loving all the yetis were, and of how loved he actually was by all of them, it was crazy! Soon all the kids joined the hug, making sure he didn't leave feeling unloved. And he didn't, if anything he felt a bit too loved, his face once again turned pale white with all the yetis squeezing the air out of him. \"Hey, take it easy on him kids, he needs to breathe.\" Migo said, his hands out, signaling for the children to let him go for a minute. The cuddly little yetis did so, making the Smallfoot fall to the ground with a yelp, luckily the snow lessened a lot of the pain. Both the kids and Migo stared at him for a few seconds in concern, until Percy lifted up a hand, signaling that he was okay. \"I'm okay.\" Percy said while taking a few deep breaths, trying to make his heart beat at least a little bit slower. Suddenly, another one of the tiny yetis grabbed Percy's leg, admiring his teeny tiny little foot. Another of the kids pulled off the little guy's boot, revealing his actual foot. They all then smiled in realization, it was... \"A Smallfoot!\" They shouted alltogether, Percy laughed at that even they called him Smallfoot, it was now confirmed that everyone in the village had that name for him. Then out of nowhere, Migo bend down to the kids, covering his mouth, whispering something to them, laughing slightly as he did so. Percy was a little confused at that moment, what did he say to them? What was he laughing about? Then one of the small furry ones started wiggling his finger against Percy's bare foot, which was still being held up by another one of them. The little guy then squirmed and laughed hysterically. \"Hey! St-hop it! Ahahahaha!\" Percy shouted between the laughs, though it only made more of the children tickle him, making him laugh more hysterically than he even thought he could. \"No! Don't- ahahahahaha! I'm se-herious!\" Migo started down at the Smallfoot, enjoying what he was looking at. The yeti loved it when his Smallfoot laughed like that, seeing that big of a smile on his face made Migo feel happier than ever. Percy noticed this time, he got a little annoyed that he just stood there and did nothing, but he figured he didn't mean anything by doing so, so his anger evaporated quickly. One of the kids then saw Percy's backpack laying in the snow. He picked up the strange item and stared at it for a bit with a questioning face. Percy then picked himself up from the ground and walked over to the little yeti. \"That's my backpack ,\" Percy began to explain, \"That's where I have all my stuff.\" Percy then zipped up his backpack and took a banana out of it as an example. The yeti looked at the banana, then at the backpack, he then reached into it to see what else was in there and found a blanket. \"That's called a blanket , I use it when I need to be warm.\" Percy explained, Migo payed extra attention to this part, he remembered how much his Smallfoot appreciated warmth, and he wanted to make sure that he got the best service he could get, so he noted in his mind that this 'blanket' could do just that. Migo then turned to look at his crossbow of a home and remembered his dad, he hadn't even gone over and said hi to him after he came back, and now with Percy teaching the children about his things and what they do with them, he thought this would be a good time to do it. \"Hey, Percy. I'm gonna go check on my dad, you think you'll be fine here with the kids?\" Migo asked hoping that Percy didn't mind him leaving for a few minutes. \"Sure, Migo. You just go, I'll stay here and teach the little ones about my stuff.\" Percy said sending a smile to Migo, and Migo smiled back. \"Okay, I'll be back as soon as possible.\" Migo said already running his way to his home, eagerly wanting to tell his dad Dorgle about what had happened. Percy laughed and shook his head as he watched Migo dash off to what seemed to be... \"Is that a giant crossbow?\" Suddenly Gwangi was standing in front of him followed by a few other yetis, and with a toilet paper roll in his hand. \"Can you translate the Scroll of Invisible Wisdom?\" Kolka asked, Percy was very confused at this point. 'Scroll of invisible wisdom', was that really what they thought toilet paper was? \"Uh,\" Percy said, huffing a little laugh. \"Sweetheart, we... we don't write on those.\" Percy said with an alarming face. Kolka's face suddenly turned from an exciting expression to a more questioning and confused look. \"Well, what do you use them for?\" She asked, getting a little more of the excitement back. Percy awkwardly looked around. \"Uhm...\" Percy felt pretty embaresed to admit what they were actually used for, he stepped a little closer to Kolka before answering. \"We use them to...\" he hand gestured for her to come closer, whispering the rest of the sentence in her ear. \"Oh! Uh, that's what it's...? Oh.\" Kolka was left with wide eyes, and some shocked, disgusted and regretting expressions on her face. \"What? What is it?\" Gwangi asked, desperately wanting to know what they were talking about. \"Uh,\" She looked at the curly yeti with an awkward look. \"They, uhm...\" she covered her mouth with her big hand, whispering the answer now in Gwangi's ear. \"Oh.\" He awkwardly switched his gaze at Percy, Kolka and the toilet paper roll (or 'the Scroll of Invisible Wisdom'). There was a minute of awkward silence between them, until Meechee showed up again. \"Hey,\" she said waving to Percy and the others, she quickly noticed that Migo wasn't there though. \"Where's Migo?\" \"Oh, he went to talk to his dad.\" Percy said. \"Oh, okay.\" Meechee said, \"Hey, you wanna see my room?\" Meechee asked in excitement, she seemed to really want Percy to come with her, looking like she wanted him to see something. He looked over at where his backpack and other things were, though the children that was investigating it before wasn't there anymore. Percy assumed that they had gotten bored since Percy was busy talking with the older yetis, and then went off to play or something. So he gathered his things and put them into his backpack again, and then climbed onto the hand of Meechee's that was held out flat in front of him. She hoisted him up to her shoulder, so he could sit there. \"It's right this way.\" Meechee said as they were walking towards the palace. Percy realized that it was the same ice sculptured building as their so called 'leader' had been standing in front of earlier, assuming it was his home as well. Meechee noticed the worried look on the little guy's face, she flickered her eyes between the Smallfoot, the palace and her father, which Percy was also looking at. She quickly figured out the pattern and got the sense that he didn't feel quite safe with the Stonekeeper, and Meechee couldn't blame him, she knew how her dad was about new things, and it often didn't turn out well. \"Don't worry, my dad never comes into my room.\" Meechee was quick to reassure him. \"Look, I promise that you'll be safe with me, okay?\" She said as she carefully, though supportively, presseing Percy up against her head with a gentle hand. Percy appreciated Meechee's concerned and reassuring reflex to make sure he wasn't scared or worried of any kind. He gently placed his smaller hand on top of one of the female yeti's fingers that was half-hugging him, and rubbed it comfortingly. \"Thanks, Meechee.\" the Smallfoot said with a soft smile on his face, the purple yeti suddenly got a very happy feeling inside. That was the first time he had actually said her name, and he even said it correctly . She hadn't expected him to remember her name that quickly, she thought that he would've got it wrong the first few times he said it, but he didn't. Maybe she was a little too happy about it, but she didn't care how much of the excitement that was in her body, it was a pretty big moment to her. Percy could almost feel the excitement that Meechee felt, he chuckled lightly adoring how cute she looked being that happy.[Chapter 5] Meechee and Percy were now inside the palace, about to enter Meechee's room. The female yeti pulled her room curtain aside, revealing her gigantic, beautiful room. Percy couldn't help but let out a 'woah' as they entered the large room full of nice decorations and beautiful colored light. \"Woah, this is really beautiful.\" Percy said while looking around in complete awe, Meechee laughed at the little guy's reaction a little before gently grabbing him, and placing him down on the ground. \"Thanks Percy, I decorated it myself.\" She said, smiling with pride down at the Smallfoot. Percy quickly saw Blossom, sitting next to Meechee's bed. She seemed pretty calm, so the Smallfoot went over to approach the mammoth once again, offering a friendly wave as he did. \"Hey there, gorgeous.\" Percy said as he carefully stroked the pink-brown mammoth's tusk, he'd taken off his glove so he could actually feel her tusk. It was kind of extra ordinary to stand face to face with an actual mammoth, as far as the human race knew, they were extinct as well. Percy was very fascinated with this amazing elephant-like creature, and had to smile when he brushed his hand alongside the magnificent creature's smooth tuck. Though when Blossom turned her head to face him, she accidentally cut a long, deep wound in Percy's hand with the sharp end of the tusk that he had placed his hand on before. \"Ahh!\" Percy shouted for a second, the blood already pouring out of the palm of his hand. The shout quickly grabbed Meechee's attention. \"What's wrong?\" Meechee asked hurrying over to the little guy, to see if anything had happened to him. \"It's nothing, Meechee. I'm okay.\" Percy said, squeezing his wounded hand together while trying to hold in the pain. It wasn't worth it though, Meechee could clearly see the blood on his hand, and gasped when she saw it. \"Percy, you're bleeding!\" Meechee said, shocked to see such a deep, long wound come on his hand so easily. She quickly, though gently, grabbed the Smallfoot and placed him onto her big, soft bed. She then grabbed a rock fruit that was cut in half, laying on a table. \"Here, let me help you.\" She said as she dipped her finger in the rock fruit jell, using the hand she wasn't using at the moment to gently grab the little guy's forearm, so she could lubricate his hand with the jell. Percy noticed that that was the exact same thing Migo had done with his knee when it was hurt in the cave, it seemed that that stuff was used a lot up there to heal wounds and stuff, and it was also very effective, it healed faster than anything Percy had ever seen. \"Thank you, It's very nice of you to take so much care of me.\" He said wearing a grateful smile, and Meechee smiled back. \"Of course, I'm not just gonna do nothing when you're hurt like this.\" the purple female yeti said. \"No, I'm serious.\" the Smallfoot said softly, \"You've all been so kind to me since I got here, and I really appreciate it. All the effort you guys give to make sure I feel happy, I couldn't be more thankful for your help.\" Percy placed his other hand on the hand Meechee was using to carefully hold his forearm while smiling softly at her, as a sign of his appreciation. Meechee perked up at that, she once again felt a rush of happiness flowing inside of her as this happened, she had to return a smile to the Smallfoot. Meechee also appreciated how kindhearted and caring Percy was being to her , comparing to them being two different species, they actually understood and helped each other more than either of them thought was possible. Still, she finished off lubricating his wound so she could explain to him why she actually wanted him to come in her room. \"There, that should help the wound heal.\" She gently let go of the Smallfoot's forearm, using the fingers on that same hand to carefully pat his head while smiling softly at him. Percy, once again, laughed and shook his head. \"Now, there's something I wanna show you.\" The purple yeti said while carefully grabbing a hold to the little guy and lifting him over to an ice table that was standing next to a big, blank stone wall. She then grabbed a big piece of coal that would be the size of a pencil from her point of view, and held it in front of Percy. \"Okay, I want to know everything there is to know about you and your world.\" Meechee said, Percy looked at the piece of coal slightly confused. Then he looked up at the stone wall and then at the piece of coal again, he slapped his forehead in realization as he realized what she wanted him to do. \"Oh, you mean by drawing?\" Percy asked as he was taking a smaller piece of coal from the one Meechee was holding. \"Yes.\" She said, \"I figured it would be easier to explain by both using words and drawings.\" Percy thought that was kind of clever, he liked her way of thinking. \"Well...\" A few moments later \"Alright, I think that's about it.\" Percy said as he was being held up by Blossom high enough to nearly reach the top of the wall, (as a sign of that she was sorry for cutting him before). He'd been drawing a lot of drawings of what it was like in the human world below the clouds, to give Meechee a more clear image of it all. \"Okay, it's a little fuzzy, but I think I'm starting to get it.\" Meechee said. \"Your job is to tell stories with the help of these 'cameras' that sort of takes a moment and shares it with other Smallfeet around the world, so they can see what you've experienced through these 'televisions' that a lot of them have in their homes, and if they like you, it'll help you get this 'money' so you can live happily and be appreciated by those who watch you.\" Meechee took a long inhale before speaking again, \"Am I close?\" Percy's eyes were open wide, he was very surprised by how quickly she had got it all together, at this point it was weird to think about how these creatures weren't at least at the same level of technology as humans. \"Yeah, you're close.\" Percy said still staring at the female yeti in shock. \"But, what is this thing here?\" She asked pointing at the drawing of a house roof. \"That's the roof of my home,\" the Smallfoot explained while pointing upward in circles, motioning to what would be Meechee's 'ceiling'. \"And we call our homes houses .\" Percy kept explaining, now pointing at the drawing of his home. Meechee found all of this very interesting and exciting, she was so fascinated by how different and yet how similar their worlds actually were. \"Oh, is that like your best friend?\" Meechee asked pointing at a drawing of an angry person. Percy laughed slightly. \"No, that's the evil banker man , he wants to take my house away, because of something called 'variable interest grades'.\" Percy explained, Meechee though lifted her shoulders in confusion. \"Huh?\" she said. \"Apparently, I don't know what it means either.\" the Smallfoot said while huffing a little laugh as he did so. Then he started shivering a little, zipping up his jacket fully up to his neck to keep himself from freezing as much as possible. \"The air is really thin up here.\" Percy said huffing another little laugh, Meechee looked at him with a tiny bit of worry in her eyes. \"Are you okay?\" she asked, but Percy shook his head while bringing one hand in front of himself, signaling that there was nothing to worry about. \"It's fine, I'm just... a little higher up than I'm used to.\" the little guy said, he noticed that that sentence gave the female yeti a bit more concerned and worried look, and quickly reassured her. \"But don't worry, I'm okay.\" the Smallfoot said offering a little smile, Meechee could tell that he was trying to cover something up, but couldn't really tell what yet and therefore chose to let it go for now. \"So, uhm... what are these?\" the purple yeti asked pointing at the little group of animals Percy had drawn. \"Those are animals . Those that are in my world.\" He said, \"This is why I do what I do, see? I was fascinated with other species, like you.\" Percy gestured to Meechee who was listening attentively. \"Actually, nothing like you. You're quite extraordinary.\" This sentence surprised Meechee, she didn't know their kind was that amazing to Percy, she sent a flattered expression to him. \"Really?\" She asked. \"Yeah,\" The Smallfoot answered, offering a smile while doing so. \"But lately I've started to only care about how many people are watching, how popular I am.\" He continued, though the happy face he was wearing before had now been replaced with a somewhat disappointed and ashamed expression, realizing how much the popularity had actually changed his personality. \"Wow, it's kind of weird hearing myself say this out loud.\" He said. Meechee soon sat down on the ice table, placing her hand carefully on the little guy's back. \"It's okay to get carried away sometimes, Percy.\" She said with a gentle tone. \"But it's what you choose to do afterwards that matters the most. That really defines you.\" That left Percy thinking for a moment, her words seemed to clear up so many of the things in his mind that had been stressing him out lately, about the show, about the viewers, about himself. He couldn't exactly put a finger on why, but there was just something about the yetis' concerning nature that made him feel safe, like he didn't have to be someone else than who he actually was. As the Smallfoot didn't know how to respond, he chose to change the subject. \"You know, when I was nine I saw my first lion.\" Percy said, \"It looked like this, see?\" He started drawing a lion on the wall with the tiny piece of coal in his hand, Meechee watched closely as he was drawing. Somehow, the drawing didn't turn out the way Percy hoped it would. \"It looked nothing like this, that looks like a fat poodle.\" The Smallfoot quickly drew a long zig zag line over what was supposed to look like a lion. \"Here, I'll just show you.\" He said pulling his phone out of his pocket, making it turn on the flashlight showing a picture of a lion. Meechee gasped at the light spread all over her, she tried swatting it away but it didn't go away. \"Woah, woah, woah, woah!\" She said, but she quickly found out that it wasn't doing anything to her. She directed her eyes to the strange little thing the light seemed to be coming from. \"Okay, what is that thing?\" The curious yeti asked, with a now excited look on her face. A few moments passed by before Meechee was getting to know Percy's phone a surprisingly lot, and was playing Candy Crush with him. Suddenly Migo entered the room, he'd heard the two of them from the other room. \"Meechee? What are you doing?\" He asked very confused. \"Migo! I'm putting shapes next to other shapes, making rows disappear.\" She explained, \"It's pointless and a complete waste of time, but I can't stop !\" She said with a wild and intense face, making Migo a little uncomfortable. Then Meechee heard some strange breathing from the direction Percy was, he was completely pale in the face. This time she knew something was wrong. \"Percy, are you okay?\" She asked with a very concerned voice, walking over to the little guy, shivering on her bed. Meechee's worried tone made Migo turn his face to the Smallfoot as well, wanting to know if he was doing alright. \"I'm feeling a little woozy, I'm going to need some more oxyg... oxygen.\" Percy tried to explain, but the lack of oxygen made it hard for him to breathe like he used to. Both Meechee and Migo were really worried now, he could barely breathe and he was freezing so much that the two yetis actually believed that his little bones could break at any moment. Then Migo remembered what the Smallfoot had mentioned earlier, about this 'blanket'. He figured it must've been in his backpack, so that was the first place Migo looked. Not long after he finally found it and hurried over to the shivering little guy and draped it over him, doing his best to make sure he wouldn't freeze to death. (To those of you who are wondering, I made Migo a bit smarter in this so the Stonekeeper didn't quite convince him that Percy or the humans were bad, since Migo's Smallfoot hadn't shown any sign of that he wanted to harm them, and also the fact that Migo knew how scared Percy had been when they first met, so Migo still only wants the best for Percy.) \"Migo, I don't...\" Percy wanted to say something, but his heavy breaths and extreme dizziness cut him off. \"It's okay, Percy. You're gonna be fine, I promise.\" Migo said to Percy with a very worried, though reassuring tone, his hand resting on the Smallfoot's back supportively, warming it up a little bit more, though sadly, really little. \"Migo, we have to take him home.\" Meechee said, \"If he stays up here...\" she walked over to Migo, putting a hand over her mouth, \"he might die.\" Even though Percy probably knew, Meechee figured it would stress him out even more if she said it out loud. The last thing the poor little guy needed right then was stressing himself out, scared for his life that he was gonna die. Migo hated the thought of letting his little innocent Smallfoot die, he could never forgive himself if anything happened to him. He looked down at Percy who was shivering and breathing way faster than he probably was supposed to, looking like he was almost about to accept his fate. Of course, there was no way Migo was going to let that happen, he cared so incredibly much about the little guy, he couldn't bare seeing him like that. Migo reached out for Percy and gently scooped him up in his arm, so he could reassure his Smallfoot that he was safe and secure, while he was still awake. Because Percy was resting on his back, Migo draped the blanket over the front of Percy's body instead of the back, so he would still be kept somewhat relaxed and warm. But right at that moment, the Stonekeeper came into the room, wearing a face that Meechee knew all too well, this wasn't going to end well for the three of them. \"Migo, give me the Smallfoot.\" The Stonekeeper comanted, with Thorp standing behind him with a human sized ice cage in his arms and a scowl directed towards Meechee and Migo. \"Yeah, give us to the Smallfoot- wait, no, uh... g-give the Smallfoot to us !\" Thorp yelled of both anger and embarrassment. \"No dad, you don't understand.\" Meechee said eager to get Percy back to where Migo found him, \"He doesn't want to hurt us, he never did. Look daddy, he's scared, cold and he can't even breathe! We have to get him home before something terrible happens to him!\" \"No!\" The Stonekeeper said, the word echoing through the room, startling the two young yetis. \"Wha-What do you mean 'no'?\" Meechee asked annoyed. \"We can't take it home,\" the Stonekeeper said, still wearing a stone face. \"what do you think will happen when he tells his kind about us?\" Meechee got a suspensious look on her face when she heard dad say that. \"Wait, you know about his kind?\" Meechee asked surprised now. \"I do and believe me, you do not want a whole bunch of them attacking us, his kind is ruthless!\" The Stonekeeper said, pointing his staff at the now unconscious Smallfoot laying in Migo's arm, Migo put his other hand up, covering him with it, not wanting the Stonekeeper to do anything to him. \"Wait, what? Attacking us?\" Meechee asked now both surprised and annoyed. Suddenly Percy woke up again, though only Migo was alert enough to notice, while the others were still talking. The sudden movement startled Migo a little, but no where near enough to loose the hold he had of his hurting little Smallfoot. \"Migo...\" Percy whimpered, not being able to say it any louder, though Migo could see that he was eager to tell him something so he kept his eyes on him, so that when he said something he would listen. \"Help me...\" Migo broke at this moment. Percy had never either looked or been this weak or helpless before, he looked into Migo's eyes with an expression that the yeti could almost hear screaming for help. \"Don't worry Percy, we're gonna bring you back home.\" Migo said as he slightly lifted Percy's head up with his index finger, while carefully stroking the blanket that was laying over the little guy, with his thumb. And it seemed to make the Smallfoot a little more calm, though it didn't lessen the pain. Migo then looked over at the others and realized that the Stonekeeper was walking past Meechee and towards Migo with an angry face. \"Migo, hand him over.\" The Stonekeeper said with a stiff and irritated voice. \"No.\" Migo said flatly, holding a hand over Percy as a sign of protection. They were all shocked by Migo's response, no one had ever challenged the Stonekeeper like that before. With an even angrier face, the Stonekeeper grabbed Percy and ripped him out of Migo's hand. \"No! Leave him alone!\" Migo shouted at the stone dressed yeti, but he didn't listen, he walked over to Thorp to put Percy in the ice cage he was holding. Percy got turned around a few times before he was dropped into the cage, letting Migo see the weak and defeated look in his eyes. And as if that wasn't enough, the Smallfoot even reached out for Migo while whimpering, that gave Migo a deep feeling of shame and disappointment of himself. He just stood there watching as his best friend got taken away, helpless and possibly dying ! \"No, no, no! He needs warmth and he can't breathe!\" Meechee yelled at her father as he was putting the poor little guy into a literal box of ice . \"Meechee.\" \"Why are you doing this?\" Meechee asked anxiously wanting an actual answer from her dad. \"You're still very young, you don't understand these things yet.\" The Stonekeeper said wearing the coldest stone face that could be seen by anyone. Meechee got extremely offended by this changing-the-topic thing he was doing. \"Stonekeeper, what are you gonna do with Percy?\" Migo asked with a serious tone. \"That you don't have to worry about.\" Meechee's father said as he and Thorp was already walking out of the room with Percy in the ice box. \"And you shouldn't name a Smallfoot, you'll just get addicted to it.\" the Stonekeeper added before leaving Meechee's room. Migo had never been this mad, he had never felt such an eager to hurt someone before, yes he actually wanted to hurt Meechee's dad! He was about to dash after him, but Meechee stopped him. \"Don't.\" Meechee said also wearing an angry face because of her father. \"Meechee, he took Percy!\" Migo said irritated that she blocked his way to get his hurting friend. \"Don't worry, I have a plan.\" Meechee said before pulling her curtain to the side, so they could talk in private.

His nose was red with irritation and a sweat had broken out across his forehead, a cold ravaging through him. Eddie had his eyes closed and his mouth open to compensate for his stuffed nose and a tissue box held perilously in his hand. He had thrown off the covers in the middle of the night, unable to stand the heat, and now lay exposed with only his boxer briefs on. \"How do you feel?\" Jane asked, tucking her hair behind her ear as she looked down at her second-time-proposer. \"Like shit…\" Eddie said through a completely stuffed nose, raising a hand to rub at his eye. \"You look like shit,\" Jane smiled, lowering herself so that she kissed the end of his irritated nose before sliding off the bed. \"Thanks.\" Eddie said sarcastically, stifling a sneeze by raising a crunched tissue to his nose. \"Whatever I can do to help…\" Jane sneered kindly, about to disappear into the hallway to go to the bathroom. \"I know something you can do to help.\" Eddie suddenly got a devilish look on his face. \"Oh? And what's that?\" Jane smiled broadly, showing off all her white teeth. Eddie only stuck up his first finger and bid her to come closer, and it wasn't until she was leaning over him with her hands wrapped around her chest to keep her shirt from drooping that he told her. With a surprised scream and Jane's giddy laughing, Eddie pulled her down on top of him and began kissing her up and down her neck, his hands fastening her against him. \"You can stay home with me…\" He mentioned between kisses, having to stop eventually before he passed out to asphyxiation. Jane pouted out her bottom lip and looked pathetically at him. \"You know I'd love to baby, but I have to go to China's 'Bring-A-Parent-To-School-Day' and then I have job interviews all the rest of the afternoon.\" Eddie sighed and let his head roll back so that his chin stuck up in the air. Jane licked her lips and kissed him gently on the throat. \"Well…\" She started, waiting until he turned his head back to face her with puffy eyes. \"I suppose I could cancel lunch with Liz…\" \"No,\" Eddie pulled it together. \"I'll survi-\" But as he tried to speak, a coughing fit caught him off guard and he had to sit up abruptly, bumping heads with Jane. After a moment, his stomach muscles relaxed and he fell back onto the bed, groaning. \"Are you sure baby?\" Jane asked, holding her head even though it didn't really hurt. Eddie took a deep breath and sat up again, grabbing her arm and pulling her hand away from her head. \"I'm positive.\" He whispered, gently placing his lips against where she had had her hand, kissing it better. She looked at him in a serious wonder. \"I'll be fine.\" He tried to assure her. \"It's only a stupid cold-\" Suddenly, his face twisted into a disgruntled look and his hands flashed up to his face, cupping his mouth and nose. A split second later, a violent sneeze echoed from his lungs, snapping his torso forward, and strangely he stayed hunched over. \"Eddie?\" Jane had a feeling of worry slide over her as she watched him just sit there. \"Yeah?\" He tried to answer nonchalantly, but from his bent position, it sounded weird. \"You okay?\" She put a hand on his unusually hot shoulder, rubbing across his shoulder blade with her thumb. \"…Yeah…\" He said in an incredibly weak voice, barely able to even get the syllable out without losing it, he wiped tears away from his eyes. Eddie brought a hand to his stomach and a grimace flashed across his face as he tried to lie back, but failed. \"You sure?\" Jane gingerly pressed on his stomach right next to his hand, making him double over in pain. \"Uh-huh,\" she said skeptically. \"I'm calling you a nursemaid for today.\" She said, rising from the bed and heading towards the hallway once again. \"No Jane. Aahh.\" He cried out in pain as the leaning forward thing sent a stab of pain through his stomach. \"I just pulled a muscle, that's all…\" He said the last part through clenched teeth. \"I'm sorry baby,\" Jane called from the kitchen, \"but I'm not gonna let you sit at home wounded and with a major cold. I'm calling a nursemaid and that's the end of it.\" Eddie frowned and crossed his arms over his chest, disgruntled anger building inside of him. He waited and listened to the muttered conversation Jane had over the phone before she hung up and walked back into the room. Eddie only looked at her from beneath his eyebrows. \"Baby, I'm doing this for you and you know it.\" She came forward and sat on the bed next to him, looking sullenly at his demeanor. She leaned forward and took his head between her hands, kissing his forehead. Eddie sighed and looked surrenderingly to her, finally nodding his head and grimacing as he tried to lie back again, this time taking his time. \"So,\" Jane slapped Eddie on the knee and rose from the bed again, heading into the closet, reemerging with a pair of gray sleeping pants and a black tee shirt. \"I have to get you dressed before the nursemaid gets here or she might fall desperately in love with a married man.\" \"What's a little obstacle anyway?\" Eddie joked, finally lying back against the bed. Jane faked an overly sarcastic laugh and punched him in the stomach, getting him to howl. \"Ow!\" Eddie retorted, scowling at her after cowering in pain. He watched as Jane began to slip his pants onto the bottom of his feet. \"You know I can dress myself, right?\" \"I know,\" Jane smiled. \"It's just more fun this way…\" She watched him shrug his shoulders and collapse back into the cushion, loving the attention. After some combat with getting his shirt on, Eddie now lay clothed enough to be seen by society. Jane looked at the digital clock next to the bed and nearly jumped in the air. \"I am sooo late!\" She breathed, forgetting everything as she dashed to the bathroom. Eddie only laughed and idly took his time as he scooted over on the bed, in the general direction of his wheelchair. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and gingerly sat up, his muscles arguing. Then he stood, turned, and sat down into his wheelchair, sucking up the pain like a real man. Then he set off towards the kitchen, nonchalantly noticing that China was up and out of her room. \"Hey baby?\" Jane called to him from the bathroom, a comb between her teeth as she held up her hair in the mirror. Eddie stopped at the end of the hall, waiting. \"Could you make China breakfast?\" Eddie looked around the corner to see China sitting up at the counter with a bowl in front of her, a spoon in her mouth, and a book set beside the bowl, and she sat and ate and read. Then Eddie spotted the little black and white body on the other side of China's bowl. \"She's already done it…\" Eddie called out with a smile, rolling forward and coming around behind China. 'Morning daddy.' China smiled widely through a mouthful of bits of Fruit Loops and casually went back to reading. 'You know,' Eddie signed, rousing China from her book again. 'Sushi shouldn't drink our milk.' He plucked the kitten from its spot by the side of the cereal bowl with a small meow, setting it down on the floor. China looked bewildered for a moment before flashing a big grin. 'She was helping me eat breakfast.' 'Well, mommy's not gonna like that. So don't let mommy see.' Eddie smiled and rubbed his hand across her head, ruffling her black hair. Holding back a sneeze again, Eddie pushed himself away from the kitchen and headed towards the living room, a sudden headache making its presence known to him. \"Alright,\" Jane came out in a flurry as Eddie was moving himself onto the couch. 'Come on, we have to go. Are you done eating?' She signed to China who nodded. 'Go brush your teeth.' She shooed China past her as she grabbed up all her and China's stuff and did a double check in her head. After a couple moments, China reemerged and smiled up at her mom, showing her newly cleaned teeth. 'Beautiful.' She commented. 'Now go kiss daddy goodbye.' Jane followed China over to her father and watched as she kissed him lightly on the cheek. Eddie grabbed her shirt with his fingers and pulled it back and forth in fun. 'You have fun at school today. You promise?' He asked. China nodded enthusiastically and moved out of the way. 'Go on baby, I'll meet you downstairs.' Jane signed, China taking her stuff from Jane's arms and running off outside. \"How do I look?\" Jane asked, too hurried to worry about it now anyway. \"Like a million dollars.\" But his words were overlapped by hers so he doubted that she had heard him. \"Okay, the nursemaid will be here soon and I'll try and be home as soon as possible, but I can't make any commitments.\" While she talked to him, her eyes were searching desperately throughout the living room floor. \"That's fine…\" Eddie said, waiting until she had dove for the shoes she had been looking for and coming back up. \"I'll miss you baby,\" Jane said, kissing him on lips while trying desperately to haphazardly to get her shoe on at the same time. \"I'll miss you too, good luck.\" He called out as she shut the door behind her. With that, his family was gone. Finally, he could have some peace and quiet. Coughing and cringing for a moment, he sat back and groped for the remote control, finally finding it and flipping on the television. For an hour and a half he sat there, going through at least eight Kleenexes before he finally forced himself to get up and go the bathroom. What a wonderful morning.[Chapter 2] This is what happens when you have too much time on your hands and too much Diet Coke in your system... CHAPTER II A Person Can Take Only So Much Comforting. Otherwise It Would Be Cruel And Unusual Punishment. Eddie had just settled back and gotten comfortable just as there came a rather loud knock at the door, the knock becoming constant as though the person was fixing to eventually break through the door with their fist. \"Hold on!\" Eddie tried to yell out, but the knocks kept coming so he figured his words must have come out intelligible. Sighing in anger, he tried desperately to push himself back into his wheelchair and maneuver it around the couch. \"I'm coming god dammit!\" He yelled, not really caring if they understood him or not. His head was throbbing with the migraine and the constant pounding was only making it that much worse. He took a deep breath as he opened the door, about to say 'Can I help you?' with forced graciousness, but instead, he found his words stuck halfway up in his throat as he took in the woman before him. Standing in his doorway was a 6'5\" bearded woman who was built like, in the worse sense of the word, a sumo wrestler. Rolls, upon rolls of fatty flesh were crammed into a little, white dress that looked like it was about to explode from over-compaction. He couldn't help but have a double take on this woman standing before him. Her disgustingly obvious bleach-blonde wig tilted to one side of her head and nested a rather large, boldly white hair clip. Her skin was frighteningly pale as though it had never seen the light. Her eyebrows kind of reminded Eddie of two black caterpillars that had accidentally died on her forehead, shading a pair of hard, steel gray eyes that were so bloodshot that not even the white showed through. Dark, purple bags of sleeplessness hooked under her eyes, seeming to be at least an inch in depth, swooping down on her cheeks. Her rounded nose nearly swallowed her entire face and a terrible three o'clock shadow shaded her upper lip. The only makeup she bothered to use was a vibrant red lipstick that made her puckering lips so bright they could pass for a traffic light. And to top off her truly unforgettable face, thick, black whiskers poked out of random spots on her chin, flaunting like lampposts against her white skin. He had to hold back the urge to gag as the smell of her assaulted his breathing rights. A plain, silver cross hung heavily on an incredibly long chain, the cross dangerously close to being swallowed up by the woman's boldly audacious exposé of her cleavage. Clipped almost inconspicuously onto the chest of her dingy, white jacket was a pin with the name BERTHA in stenciled, black lettering and a sparkling red cross sticker stuck next to it. \"You Alden?\" The woman boomed, her voice so deep that she had the effect of thunder rolling through the room, almost manly. \"Y-y-yes…\" Eddie's pulse began to race as he suddenly felt his life to be in danger. \"You da one dat's sick?\" Her verbalization was slathered thickly with a German accent that almost slaughtered her words unintelligible. \"Yes…\" That's all he could bring to his throat at the moment. \"I your nurse for today,\" She stomped into the room, her white tennis shoes doing little to quiet her footfalls. Eddie blinked away the sweat from his eyes and cleared his throat, trying to force out conversation. \"I take it your name is Bertha…\" He smiled, only to drop it as she looked at him in confusion. \"It says on your nametag…\" He said meekly, quickly pointing to where he had read the name, then quick to pull in his appendages as if she might bite them off. She looked down at her chest and ran a hotdog-like finger over the lettering. \"No. Name is Annabella. Bertha last name. Annabella no fit on nametag.\" She stuck a thumb into her chest, proudly exploiting her name. \"You call me Annabella. Good for you?\" She raised a shaggy eyebrow towards him, seeming to dare him to object. \"That's fine,\" Eddie laughed lightly, trying desperately to ease the discomfort and bring down his rising temperature. Her appalling eyes stayed locked on him for a couple more seconds before tearing off as she waddled into the room, taking a long sniff through her nose. Her fanned, white skirt shifted nervously over her butt and thighs, repulsing Eddie. \"So dis your kitchen?\" She thundered, spreading her arms wide in the direction of the fridge and countertop. She turned to him and smiled widely, showing a mouthful of crooked yellow teeth. \"Yeah,\" Eddie smiled back, wiping the collected sweat away from his face and running the clasped kleenex under his nose. As she turned back to face the kitchen again, Eddie shut the door and cringed inwardly, swearing with all his heart that he was going to get Jane back for this, even if it was the last thing he did. He took a moment to recollect himself before turning around and beginning to push himself back over to the couch. He cinched his eyes shut as the woman began loudly opening and closing cupboards, sending flares of pain through Eddie's head. \"So why you in dat wheelchair?\" The woman asked, standing up from her crouched position behind the counter, a pot in her hand. Eddie paused a minute, looking at her. Why did she want to know that? Was she planning on bashing him over the head with the pot when she found out he was chair-ridden? No, she would've done it by now. \"I, uh, I got hurt and had to get an operation.\" He didn't really remember a lot about it, only what Jane had told him, but she sugarcoated most of it, so he couldn't be sure on anything. \"So nothing wrong wid dem feet o' yours?\" Eddie shook his head in complete confusion. Annabella just shrugged and went back to exploring the kitchen. As Eddie made his way around the far side of the couch, maneuvering his wheelchair so that it sat between the couch and the coffee table and made it easy to pull himself up onto the couch. His struggle onto the couch was only interrupted once by a fit of coughing that made him sink to one knee until he could recover. It took him a moment to catch his breath before he was able to push himself up onto the couch. Finally up, he stretched himself out and let his aching head sink back into the pillows, the pain easing off just a tad. \"You got a bafroom?\" Annabella's voice rolled like a storm. \"It's down the hall to the right.\" Eddie cringed as he closed his eyes, his head feeling like it was going to explode, while she pounded off in the direction he'd given her. He sighed stuffily as his hand groped for the tissue box, pulling it in so that it rested on top of his chest. Hearing Annabella rattling around in the medicine cabinet above the sink. Good thing he had hid all the condom boxes in a different place. There was a moment of relaxation before something small and sandpapery rubbed across the bottom of his bare foot. Eddie jumped and his eyes snapped open, taking in the little black and white face of a pouting kitten. It squeaked a tiny noise that could barely pass for a meow and looked up at him with huge, green, pleading eyes. Eddie laughed and sat up, faltering when a wave of sickness washed over him by the redirected blood-flow. After it passed, he bent and picked up the kitten, lying back once again and placing it on the top of his chest, watching it. The kitten sat there for a moment before deciding to survey its new territory. Sushi walked up to his shoulder and looked him straight in the face, then she gave him a big sandpaper kiss on the chin. Eddie cringed and laughed, petting the cat with his thumb, getting a low purr going in the cat's throat. The cat nestled down against his neck, purring noisily now right below his ear as Eddie closed his eyes again, listening to the rhythmic vibration of the cat's throat as he slowly began to drift off into the darkness. He was drifting into the abyss when suddenly the hair on the back of his neck stood up on end and a strange feeling crept over him. Like he was in a warm place and was suddenly smothered by a cold shadow, almost like he was being watched. He groaned slightly and twitched, seeing if the feeling would remove itself from his skin, but it stayed. And, strangely, it moved, seeming to come closer and a series of sharp needles brushed across his skin. He took a deep breath in annoyance and reluctantly began to float back into consciousness, his eyes lazy to his command to open as they slowly fluttered apart to reveal - \"HOLY SHIT!\" Eddie yelled, his eyes wide and his breath stuck in his throat. Annabella was bent beside him, her ugly face hanging dangerously close to his, her fat cheeks drooping until they - oh god, that's what brushed against him. Eddie was completely repulsed as he closed his eyes and gently raised a hand, maneuvering it so that it was against her shoulder, and pushed her away. Annabella put up no resistance and stood up, her knees cracking. The crack would have been louder, Eddie guessed, if they had not been surrounded by a padding of corpulent flesh, the idea made him want to puke. \"You awake now Alden?\" Annabella asked, her voice making his spine shake and his stomach tie itself in knots. \"I think I'm gonna be sick…\" Eddie said more to himself, gently moving Sushi from his shoulder as he sat up. \"You already sick.\" Annabella pointed out, something black stuck between her teeth, forcing Eddie to look away. \"No,\" Eddie tried to explain as he stumbled in the direction of his wheelchair. He forced himself to move quickly, the bile already beginning to rise in his throat. Even though it was against doctor's orders to walk just yet, he had no choice. As fast as his legs would carry him, he fled to the bathroom, unable to close the door behind him as he fell to his knees and worshiped the porcelain god. Annabella rocked back on her heels and smiled to herself, taking her precious time as she waddled to the bathroom, seeing Eddie knelt over the toilet, all hell breaking loose. She reached over and took the hand-towel from the ring, waiting until he finally sat up before waddling into the bathroom. Eddie's face was dangerously pale and sweat speckled his forehead. Annabella bent down and handed him the towel, which he used to wipe the sweat from his head then wipe the spit from his chin. \"You feel better now?\" She asked, taking the towel back from him and watching him scoot back from the toilet. It took him a moment to gather his breath. \"I-I don't think I can make it back-\" He was about to finish his sentence with \"without the wheelchair\" but she interrupted. \"Come,\" She threw out her flabby arms, reaching down and beginning to pluck him from the floor. \"I carry you.\" Without any chance of escape, Eddie was gathered into her arms and squashed against her chest. He tried many times to object as she began to waddle back out into the living room, but he was only silenced. \"Shush, shush.\" Annabella said like a mother to her child. \"You sick. I take care of you.\" She smiled in friendliness at herself as she brought him around to the couch. Sushi peered up from the cushions at the awkwardly handled Eddie and the well-fed girth of Annabella, mewing softly. \"Shoo!\" Annabella commanded, Sushi seemed puzzled for a moment before she arched her back and fluffed her hair, showing her teeth and letting out a small hiss of animosity. Annabella just leaned back and laughed a booming laugh that could only be compared to an elephant dying. \"Woah!\" Eddie grabbed onto Annabella's shirt, not wanting to fall, her breath unnaturally hot against his arm. As she finished laughing, she leaned forward and brought her foot down as hard against the floor as she possibly could without breaking through, scaring the cat AND Eddie nearly half to death. Quick as lightening, the cat took off into China's room and scurried under the bed, Eddie having no such pleasure of escape. \"Why you have cat anyway? Make you more sick what it does.\" Annabella mumbled rhetorically to herself as she set Eddie down on the couch, finally freeing him from a flabby fate of being swallowed whole. \"No lying down,\" Annabella warned him and he looked agitatedly questioning at her. \"You eat soon.\" He was about to object that he probably wouldn't be able to keep it down, but she stopped him again. \"No argue, just stay up.\" She said, and from the daring look she gave her, he wasn't about to. \"No move.\" She said, rising and lumbering off toward Eddie's bedroom. After she disappeared into the doorway, Eddie breathed a sigh of relief and hunched down on the couch. Jane was gonna pay for this…big time… Suddenly, Eddie became very cold, goosebumps breaking out across his arms as he sighed inwardly to himself, feeling like shit. Then, Annabella's footsteps resounded behind him, and he cringed. He jumped as something heavy fell across his shoulders and he looked up to see her motherly tucking a blanket around his neck and back. \"Thanks,\" Eddie said between coughs, leaning forward to grab a tissue and pull the box in with him as he leaned back. Then Annabella came around front and tucked another blanket around his chest and neck, nearly suffocating him when she leaned over. \"There.\" She smiled satisfactory to herself as she stood, surveying her handy work. \"I go get food now.\" She set off to the kitchen where she had been cooking before. Eddie let his head fall back against the couch as he pulled the blankets more closely to his body, shivering slightly as a cold chill rolled up his spine. He tried to ignore it, letting his mind wander on more important things, like what he was going to do to Jane. Then quickly, Annabella made her faithful return with a tray steadily held in her pudgy hands, a bowl of steaming soup, a glass of water, a dozen saltines, and one immense, white pill set astray on it. She sat heavily down on the chair opposite Eddie. She cleared a spot on the coffee table as she set down the tray, smiling proudly at her dinner that actually didn't look too bad. Even though Eddie seriously doubted that he could keep anything down right now. \"Eat now,\" Annabella boomed, watching as Eddie opened his mouth to object. \"I don't think I can eat that right now…\" Eddie mentioned, becoming fainthearted as her eyebrows raised and her eyes widened and she stared at him appallingly, as if he'd just said the most heinous of words. \"Why?\" She asked, threw out her arms in shock, signaling towards her food. \"Does it not please you?\" She seemed hurt that he did not want to eat her food. \"No, Annabella.\" He tried to reason and calm the disgruntled beast that could easily eat HIM. \"It's not your food, I'm sure it's wonderful. I just don't think I can keep anything down right now. I feel very sick.\" Annabella put her hands on her hips and turned her head so that she looked at him from the corner of her slitted eye, breathing heavily through her nose, blowing something out of it. Eddie held back a shudder, closing his eyes and trying to regain his somersaulting organs. She stared at him for a moment as if to confirm his story and then suddenly clamped a hand across his forehead, her hand covering well below his eyes as well. It felt like someone had pushed a recently soaked nylon filled with unprocessed sausage onto his head, unconsciously sensing that she was about to crush his skull at any second. After a moment, she released his head and he tried to regain his spinning thoughts, blinking away the fading lights of his eyes as his life flashed through his head. \"You're very hot.\" She stated blandly, beginning to unpeel the blankets that he clutched closely to his freezing, shivering body. He had a moment of courage before it shallowed itself to a pitiful vulnerability. He clutched his arms around himself as he tried to keep at least a tiny bit of warmth against him. At the moment, he cursed his deceitful head. Annabella stared at him for a long while, screwing up her face as she seemed to be negotiating something in her head about him. Then she puckered out her lips and leaned forward and plucked the uncommonly large, white pill from the tray and stood difficulty up. Eddie was perplexed that she didn't offer him the water also. \"What's that for?\" He asked, confusion clogging his mind. \"Turn over.\" Annabella stated. \"Why?…\" But suddenly, the horrific realization hit him square in the face. \"Hell no.\" Eddie threw up his hands in defense, as if he was stopping a bullet. Annabella tilted her head and looked at him challengingly. \"No. No, absolutely not.\" Eddie shook his head in disbelief and complete resistance. \"You must.\" She stated in defense. \"Do not even THINK about it. There is no way in HELL you're going to get close enough to stick that thing up my…hell no.\" He couldn't even finish his sentence, the thought was so revolting. \"Alden!\" Her voice was so loud that it literally shook the walls, one corner of the sheet across China's bedroom falling off of its nail. \"Your wife pay me. I do my job. Now.\" She grabbed him roughly by the arm. \"You turn over.\" It was now or never. \"The fuck with that!\" Eddie wrenched his arm free and sprang up from the couch before Annabella could react in time. In a second, he was stumbling over the top of the couch and landing dumbly on the floor on the other side, his legs giving out momentarily. He went just short of collapsing before he forced himself back up, hearing the monster roar behind him. \"You not suppose to walk!\" 'Desperate times call for desperate measures.' The words flashed across his mind as he worked his legs in the direction of the bathroom, ignoring the swallowing headache that was beating on his brain. He swore he could feel her beefy fingers sweep past his shirt as she made a swipe for him, luckily coming up too short. He ran as fast as his legs would carry him, and he slid in to the bathroom with the beast pounding after him, her footsteps threatening to break through the ground. As he reached the bathroom, he turned and the seconds of complete terror as he watched the situation unfold, it bowed into slow motion, doing a play-by-play. \"RRRRAAAAAHHHHH!!!!\" Annabella yelled with a wide, oval-shaped mouth as she leapt solidly into the air, majestically getting all two-hundred-and-something pounds to lift off the ground and actually move in his direction. Her head swiveled as she flew through the air and her fatty rolls flopped from side to side as she came inch, by fatty inch, closer to him. His hands were slow as he groped blindly for the doorknob, his eyes not able to tear away from the flying woman that was soaring toward him. \"NNNOOOOOO!!!!\" Annabella fumed. It took time to find the door, almost too much time. Every second dragging on as though they lasted for an entire minute, everything rolling along. Eventually, he found the door and he put all his weight on it to shove it closed, hastily turning the lock as the last fatal minutes of his danger came within mere inches. The sound of a two-hundred-pound woman hitting a solid wooden door at mock one speed is indescribable! The groaning of the wood as she slides down the amazingly unbroken wood is disgustingly astounding! Eddie stood in silence for a split-second, everything replaying in one, deft flash. But the silence didn't last. The beast still lived. Suddenly, there was the sound of fingernails digging into the door as Annabella clawed her way back up onto her feet, the breath having been compressed out of her with her fall. She wheezed a sound so horrifying that the hair on the back of Eddie's neck stood straight up on end, threatening to pull right out of his skin. Then the wheezing suddenly became mixed with the sound of her beefy fist rhythmically pounding against the door. He guessed that she lacked the breath to call out his name whilst she pounded, and horror struck his throat as she began to frantically turn the handle to the door, not letting the small fact that it be locked stop her. He began to back away from the door, swearing with all his heart that he heard the wood begin to splinter beneath her pounding fist. \"No…\" He whispered beneath his breath, inconceivable that it could happen, but feign to reality. \"No…no…no…no…\" He shook his head and continued backing away from the door, his hands held out to protect himself and his footsteps unheeded. That's when it happened. That's when fate took control. He took one fatal step backward, right onto a sideways bottle that Annabella had negligently thrown to the floor while she had rummaged through the medicine cabinet. In one, fluid motion he was thrown up into the air and smashed backwards into the ground, his head striking the side of the bathtub and leaving a long, red smear as blackness thundered over him.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER III Go Away. I'm all right. - Last words of H. G. Wells \"Eddie?\" The voice floated to him as if from a dream. \"Eddie, honey. Wake up.\" The voice of the angel drifted into his ear again, a smooth, soft hand caressing the side of his cheek and arousing him from the inky darkness. He moaned and jerked, trying to cling onto the last thread of comforting blackness that slipped away and he was suddenly plummeted into a world full of pain. \"Come on baby, open your eyes…\" The angel spoke again. He twitched spasmodically and began to do what the angel instructed, his eyelids heavy and his vision doubled as he finally got them open. \"That's it…\" The angel coaxed. Suddenly, the light of the outside room flared in his head and he whimpered and recoiled back into the darkness of his head, closing his eyes again. \"Eddie…\" But he cut off the angel. \"Oh god…\" His voice was low and grating. \"Did she kill me?\" \"Baby,\" The angel slipped their dainty hand into his, squeezing it gently, ignoring him. \"You need to open your eyes for me.\" He was about to open his mouth in question when suddenly he was violated. An uninvited someone suddenly interceding without compliance. \"Mr. Alden?\" The voice was rough and uncaring. \"Are you conscious sir?\" Someone was wrenching open his right eye and shining a blinding pen light into his eye. Eddie grunted and recoiled deeper into the darkness, pulling away from the blinding touch. \"Sir?\" It asked again. \"Yes. I'm conscious. Leave me alone.\" Eddie demanded, still holding onto the hand of his angel. He heard the angel speak to the rough voice and tell them that they had better go. He smiled. Though he hadn't expected heaven to be so mean. Then the hand was back stroking his face. \"Please baby, open your eyes and show me you're okay.\" The angel seemed worried. Eddie sighed and slowly began opening his eyes again, not wanting the angel to be worried anymore. He held back the pressing pain of a monstrous headache as his vision slowly slurred back together, two images becoming one, and he looked up into the smiling face of his angel, his wife, Jane Alden. He was suddenly filled with relief as he began to sit up and wrap his arms around her shoulders in comfort, but was suddenly pulled back by an immense pain in his head. He moaned and twisted in the bed sheets, the pain in his head overtaking him with such a force he could barely move. \"Eddie, calm down.\" Jane said, still stroking his face with her fingers. \"Do you remember what happened?\" He couldn't bear to shake his head. She took the silence as a 'no'. \"You tripped and hit your head against the bathtub, you've been unconscious for almost four hours.\" \"Where? Where am I?\" He asked in a soft whisper. \"You're home baby,\" Jane squeezed his hand again. \"Everything's gonna be okay.\" \"My head.\" He groaned, raising a hand to his head and feeling the IV taped in the crook of his elbow shift at the motion. \"You hit it pretty hard,\" Jane pulled his hand away before he had a chance to touch it. \"The medication should be setting in soon.\" There was a fresh bandage around his head and she didn't want him to mess with it. Eddie slowly opened his eyes again, letting Jane's concerned face float into his head and eventually correct itself. Then he remembered. \"Where is she?\" Eddie said, his voice ricocheting through his head like thunder in a metal room. He tried to sit up again, despite the pain, and nausea, and Jane's pushing hand on his shoulder. \"Just lie back. Relax for a while,\" Jane cooed, smiling when he surrendered to a slanted position against the pillows in the bed. She waited until he was somewhat comfortable. \"Who?\" \"Her. Anne-belly or whatever. The crazy bitch that did this to me.\" His mind was in a haze and he knew he had gotten the name wrong. \"Annabella?\" Jane corrected, still holding both his hands. Eddie nodded lightly, bringing forth more pain. Jane suddenly got red in the cheeks as her face was overcome with embarrassment. Eddie's face dropped in despair. \"What?\" He asked slowly, fearing the answer. \"Well, uh…\" Jane started, but suddenly there came the sound. \"He awake now?\" Speak of the devil. The incarnate of a sprinkled donut stood in all her flabby glory in the doorway of his room. Eddie's breathing became dangerously short. Jane's fingers loosened as she began to slip away, in a strange way, protecting herself. \"Well, baby…\" She said, smiling meekly. \"When I came home and had to pry off the door to the bathroom to find you unconscious on the floor and had to call the paramedics…\" She smiled again as if it would save her. \"Um…\" Jane cleared her throat, the tension in the room becoming almost a tangible choking hazard. \"Annabella offered to take care of you for the rest of the afternoon free of charge while I still have some meetings and stuff to go to…\" She trailed off, now with her back against the wall; a safe distance from her bed-ridden, wounded, awe struck husband who could just about pass for a ghost right now, due to the fact that he was so pale. Eddie's wide eyes slowly met the face of his living nightmare. Annabella's right eye was covered in taped gauze and her nose was bruised to a point where she looked like a person that would make a drunken pirate pee his pants at the sight of. She was smiling a huge, yellow smile that sent a shiver rolling down Eddie's spine. Eddie had his mouth agape as his eyes slowly rolled back to the face of his wife, who was smiling too broadly for the situation. She seemed really, really nervous by the fact that her eyes were switching back and forth so quickly that they moved in a blink. Jane could feel the beads of sweat rolling down her forehead as she quickly thought of something to do. Impulsively she looked down at her wristwatch, over-acting things. \"Oh. WOW! Just LOOK at the time!\" She said like an actor so wooden that you would want to spray Liquid Pledge on her. \"I need to go.\" She headed towards the door, Annabella sliding out of the way without a second thought and smiling thoughtfully as Jane rushed by. It was obvious Annabella liked women more then men. In fact, she probably ATE men for dinner. \"I'll be home in a little while,\" Jane called from the hallway. \"I love you.\" But Eddie didn't answer. He was too preoccupied with his 6'5\" sumo-slayer that was using herself as a blockade to the doorway should he decide to escape. She had a look on her face that dared him to move a finger, and told him that if he did, he'd lose it. It's when he heard the door shut behind Jane that he knew his fate was sealed. \"So…\" Annabella drug out her word, her tongue thick, her pudgy legs carrying her into the room as she squeezed through the doorframe. \"You know now what happen when you disobey doctor orders.\" She shut the door behind her, turning the lock in her bulgy fingers without even having to look back. She kept herself always in front of the door as she lumbered forwards toward the bed, coming closer, and closer, and closer. Eddie scooted back in the bed, ignoring the pain in his head, the IV hooked up to him, and the fact that his legs refused to move at the moment. But she kept coming. \"You still very sick Alden.\" Like she needed to tell him. He was about to lose his nonexistent lunch again by her stench wafting into his nose. His wheelchair was in the far corner, behind Annabella. He had no salvation. One misplaced distraction and she swooped in for the kill. Quick as a fat bolt of lightening, she grabbed Eddie's IV-free arm and twisted it behind him, making his body spasmodically contort around so that he was on his side. And in his few last seconds he watched with utter shock. And that's when she did it. The most horrifying thing that has ever happened on the face of the earth. She pulled out… THE WHITE PILL!!!! \"No!\" Eddie screamed. \"No! No! No! No! No…\" \"…\" THE END ","Summary":" TITLE: You've Really Put Your Hoof In It This Time AUTHOR: Ananova Crowe E-MAIL: Out4HughJackman@ao"},{"Movie":"Smallfoot","Title":"A child's wish","Author":"OneSweetFanFictor","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103931","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hiiii! So, this is a Smallfoot FanFic. Because I REALLY like this movie. I wish they would come out on dvd. If you haven't watched it...Stop what your doing, go to the movies. If I did, good jobjob buddy! Remember when Meechee introduced Migo to the S.E.S, and she told him, \"This was the first one I saw. The one that started it all.\" Then I was all like, \"wait. ..when was that?\" (Bc I was watching this with a friend.) WELL NOW U GET TO SEE WHEN MY FRIENDS. Let's begin...[Chapter 2] Bang...Bang...Bang... I wake up to a loud but muffled banging sound. \"Mmm..won't Thorp shut up? \" The banging continues. \"UUUUGH!\" I yell impatiently. I get up from my bed and head to the bathroom. I open the door to see blossom laying down right smack in the middle of it. I pick her up and set her on my bed. I give her a light kiss, and continue my morning. I open the door to hear a clearer, more louder banging. And that wasn't Thorp. I see my dad writing on the stones again. I smile and jog towards him. \"Good morning little one.\" He says to me. \"Good morning Stonekeeper.\" I say with a smirk. I walk through \"The hall of Stonekeepers\" . \"Father, can I go outside?\" I ask outing my hand on the ice wall between me and my \"freedom\". He stops what he's doing, and looks towards me. \"Go ahead.\" He says and starts up again. I smile and run to the lever. It raises up, and I run outside. As I walked through the village, I was greeted by the villagers of course! They all knew who I was. Even the little kids. \"Ok, Meechee.\" Thorp says to me. \"You'll be older than me in a million years.\" He smiles. \"But that's too long!\" I complain. Our father laughs at us. Suddenly, we are interrupted by a young boy about Thorps age (at the time). \"Stonekeeper!\" He yells while running towards us. We all look at him. \"Stonekeeper! These kids are saying they found a smallfoot!\" Me and Thorp look at each other. Didn't the stone say there was no such thing? \"I'll be right there.\" Stonekeeper says. \" Thorp take care of your sister. Meechee, be careful. \" He walks away and into the crowd. \"We've got to see what's going on!\" I tell my brother. I grab his hand, and we follow Stonekeeper. Once we get close enough, we see three little kids about my age. \"Everyone listen please!\" One says. \"We really did find a smallfoot!\" Another says. \"AND we have proof!\" The last one says. \"Now, Now.\" Stonekeeper says. \"Let's see what proof you have.\" The round, purple fur having yeti showed what looked like a small jacket. One to fit...A Smallfoot! I go closer to my father. \"Daddy, what if the smallfoot..is real?\" Everyone gasps. My father looks at me with fearful eyes. \"Do you see what this does?! It corrupts our children's minds!\" He says. Stonekeeper then takes the jacket from the purple yeti. \"That's it everyone! Go back to your work!\" Everybody leaves and goes back to what they were doing before. I look at the kids. They look so disappointed and frustrated. I walk towards them. \"Hey..\" I start. They all look up suprised, then suspicious. \"Um..did you really see a smallfoot?\" The little , short boy comes up to me. \"What's it to you?\" He says. \"I..was..uh..curious.\" They all look at each other. The girl with the cute ponytail speaks. \"We're glad to hear you say that\". She says with an enthusiastic smile. I look at her, then the two other yetis. \"Why?\" I finally say. \" Because, we're gonna explore\". \"And we need a fourth person\".[Chapter 3] \"Ok, so..what are we doing again?\" The little girl known as Kolka , was keeping a lookout, making sure we weren't heard. It was pretty late, about 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning. The purple fur having yeti, or Gwangi , told me that we were going out of the village, and searching for more evidence. I was hesitant about leaving the only home I know, AT NIGHT, but, I knew they were desperate, and wanted to prove that the smallfoot exists. \"Ok, we're in the clear!\" Kolka says. \" Wait! \" I stop her. \"Where's fleem?\" Kolka and Gwangi look at each other. \"Fleem sucks.\" They both say. I nod my head slowly. They walk towards the hedge where the boundary between our home and the outside world was kept. They walk past it with ease, but I was a little afraid. I take a few deep breaths. \"It's ok Meechee.\" I whisper to myself. \"Curiosity is Stronger than Fear.\" And I kept that quote in mind ever since. Kolka brought three of her light snails, so we could have a good look at things. She gave the purple to Gwangi, and the Blue to me, while she kept the yellow/green. I smiled lightly. She knew it was my favorite color. I follow them around, while we look for signs of a smallfoot. We then reach what looks like a cliff. I remember one of the stones saying, \"If we don't do our jobs, we can't feed the mammoths. And if we don't feed the mammoths, they'll fall. And we'll fall with them. Into the great nothingness.\" I shudder at the thought. \"Ok, let's split up.\" Kolka insisted. \"Gwangi and I will go this way, and you can go right Meechee.\" I nod. \"Mechee?\" Stonekeeper asks. He walks opens the door to her room slightly. Meechee looks like she is facing the wall, her braid showing. Stonekeeper smiles, and closes the door. Little does he know, \"Meechee\" is a prop the real one made to trick her father. I look everywhere, but can't find a single piece of smallfoot evidence. I venture far from the cliff, searching high and low. I get so caught up in looking for clues, that I forget all about going back. \"Come on..\" I complain. \"There's got to be something up here.\" My snail is on the verge on going to sleep, and turning it's light off. I sigh. I know I have to go back. Maybe we'll try tomorrow. I walk back in the direction of the village, when something sticking out of the snow catches my eye. I slowly make my way to it. As I get closer, it makes out something small. I finally reach it. When I take it out of the snow, it looks like a small boot. \"It is real...\"[Chapter 4] \"You actually found it!\" Our little group huddles around the boot in my room. Somehow I managed to convince my father to let them have a \"sleepover\". Twice. \"Where did you find this again?\" Fleem says. \" Somewhere up a mountain, not very far from the village.\" I reply. \"I can't believe I found something like this! If you hadn't told me where to go Kolka, I would never had found this.\" \"We do good if we work together!\" Gwangi says. Then, I got an extraordinary idea. \"What if we, become..a team?\" I say. The three look at me. \"Yeah, a team. No, a society!\" I quickly stand up, and run towards my bed. I climb on top of it, and start drawing and writing on the wall. \"We'll be a society that finds evidence about things that we believe are true. Like the smallfoot. Or, we should just do research on the smallfoot!\" I draw more and more pictures of what we found, the boot, etc. I turn and face my new friends. \"We'll be..\" I jump off the bed in the middle of my sentence. \"The S.E.S.\" I could tell Kolka and Gwangi really liked my idea. Honestly, I was only paying attention to their needs and my own ideas. \"That's amazing Meech.\" Kolka says. I blush. No ones ever called me that nickname before. \"Let's do it.\" Gwangi says. \"Really!?\" \"I'm down.\" Fleem says. Kolka gives me a little nod. Smiling widely, I put my hand down. \"To the S.E.S.\" Kolka copies. \"To the S.E.S.\" Gwangi and Fleem join. \"To the S.E.S.!\" And there were more adventures to come..[Chapter 5] The S.E.S. has been up and running ever since Meechee made it, with the help of her friends. For About eight years, they've been searching for evidence and clues, and found a lot of it. Meechee even found a cave for meetings. She filled it up with light snails of each member's favorite color, drawings and words about the smallfoot, and of course, their evidence. They even got a new member, Migo! And his smallfoot, Percy. Together their adventures will be endless. Wonder what happens next. ;) ","Summary":" Hiiii! So, this is a Smallfoot FanFic. Because I REALLY like this movie. I wish they would come out"},{"Movie":"Boat That Rocked","Title":"Rock the Boat","Author":"thisisforyou","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6122065","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I started this when extremely bored in study class, and finished this chapter in the hour I was waiting for my pizza last night with my mother in an absolutely stupid mood (I love her so much) playing obscene word games and throwing salami at the waiter, and let's not mention peeing ourselves in the movie theater because we could see spit flying from Ben Chaplin's mouth when he was giving Mark Anthony's balcony speech in Me and Orson Welles (brilliant movie. Love you forever, Mum.) Anywho, those of you who only decided to read this story because you think Gavin is \"so beautiful it's impossible to talk to him, you just want to have sex with him\" (his words, not mine), I apologise; he's not actually here yet. He'll come along later, when he's needed to make the story flow. I also apologise for the chronic unoriginality of the events in this story: absolutey all of them except the Charades game (thanks again, Mum, for the stampede idea) and the one-on-one conversations with Courtenay were stolen from the deleted scenes on disc. I own nothing, of course, except the clothes on my back, and Courtenay. Updates should be reasonable; I'm managing to churn the stuff out quite fast. Anyway, I hope you enjoy... free cookie for each review! -for you They were sunbathing when I got there, twenty-two years old, broke and brok en through too many cigarettes and late-night drinks and too much rock music. I'm still convinced that it was the rock music that did it, which makes ironic sense in ways Mum wouldn't even begin to understand. Sending me to the boat was her last resort, her 'oh-no-you-didn't' reaction to the final straw, that shout where her voice broke in anger: \"Go live with your father!\" Sometimes I wonder if she even knew the man. Then I realise that if she did, she wouldn't have wasted years of my life trying to straighten me out. I was always more like Dad. I think that's what hurt her the most, that after twenty-two years of living with her, only her, day in and day out, I still turned out to be more like a man she'd known for a few hours, and the only thing he'd ever given her was his sperm. I don't think she knew about the radio. I also think this was probably a good thing. If she'd known he was the one who gave me the means to play Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones at top volume twenty-four/seven she would have blown some kind of steam valve. So, anyway, there they were, just lying there in the sun, doing nothing, looking like they'd been doing it for too long to mention stopping. I'd worn skimpy orange shorts because of the weather, and the moment I saw the assortment of bacheloresque males lying on Radio Rock 's deck, I regretted the decision. No, actually. It was the moment they saw me . The way they jumped up and ran to the railings like bulls in a farmer's paddock. I began to feel enormously intimidated. Dad wasn't there. In fact, he hadn't even told them I was coming. As I climbed over the railing, feeling like I was about to be charged, a tubby blonde man with a generous covering of facial insulation took my hand and kissed it with a strongly American comment of \"What can a bunch of guys like us do for a girl like you?\" I removed my hand from his reach and tried not to wipe it on my shorts. \"I'm looking for Quentin? I'm Courtenay. Didn't he tell you I was coming?\" A man at he back of the crowd, wearing very square glasses and reminding me irresistibly of Kermit the Frog squeaked out \"I'll go get him\" and ran away. \"Well, Courtenay,\" the blonde man purred, \"I'm the Count.\" \"Oh, you're the Count?\" I repeated, suddenly excited. \"I'd imagined you to be less… um…\" \"Handsome?\" he suggested, rubbing his beard. I shook my head, grinning. \"Pudgy,\" put in a thickset man with ginger hair and tartan shorts and an accent I couldn't place. That was the word I'd been looking for, but I settled for \"Hairy.\" In the next few minutes, I was introduced to the people I'd been listening to for years: Angus 'the Nut' Nutsford, Simple Simon Swafford, Dr. Dave, Thick Kevin and even Midnight Mark lifted a cigarette at me from where he lay topside. Then the door that led inside opened and out stepped an unnaturally thin and wiry man wearing a suit and scarf despite the weather. I knew him at once, even though I'd never met him. He looked exactly like he sounded on paper. I would have hugged and probably even kissed him, despite not being a typically emotional person, but he didn't really seem the type. \"Hello, Darling,\" he said in that way he has, that I didn't know back then but now recognise faster than my face in the mirror. \"I see you've been introduced to the crew.\" He turned to the rest of them in a matter-of-fact way. \"Crew, this is my daughter Courtenay. I probably should have mentioned it earlier, but she'll be living with us until she gets bored.\" He looked at me sideways. \"Or until her mother claims her back.\" I shared his grin. \"Daughter?\" came the loud question from Dr. Dave, the fat bloke in the thick glasses. \"Quentin, how did you make something that gorgeous?\" I would have blushed if I'd found him even remotely attractive. \"I assure you it was accidental,\" Dad replied airily. \"Now. I'd just like to make it clear to all of you that there are some rules around this arrangement.\" He said it in a way that from anyone else would have seemed businesslike, but from him made me want to laugh. \"Number One: on no account is she to fall in love with any of you. That means hands will need to be kept in pockets,\" he looked pointedly at Dr. Dave. \"Number Two: her gender does not automatically put her ahead of you when it comes to cooking and dishes and all that stuff. Got it?\" I grinned as they all nodded obediently. \"Good. Well then, Courtenay,\" he said, turning to me and opening his arms quirkily, \"Welcome aboard.\" I hugged him, albeit gently; he was so skinny I thought he might break. I hadn't expected him to be so fatherly. I mean, he was , and all, but I'd never met the guy before. That first day he treated me like I'd just come back from spending a year at my mother's, not a lifetime. But I wasn't complaining; that day, a month before the Christmas leading up to my twenty-third birthday, heralded the coming of the best years of my life. For a while, Dad was a bit over-protective. He'd stop the boys from playing pratical jokes on me and make sure I was first in the bathroom in the morning. Then he realised that I'd rather make my own way and earn my place with them, put up with the whoopee-cushions on my seat and fight my way into the bathroom queue rather than have their affection forced by his hand. That Christmas he hired a cook, Felicity; he said he was sick of the quality of food on the boat, but I think he did it to give me some female company. Felicity was bubbly and bright, although a little meek and timid, and I loved her assortment of bright knitted jerseys and hats. Then, for my twenty-third birthday in April, the boys banded together and shifted room for me on the air; soon I was broadcasting with the others. It was the best thing in the world, knowing that ninety-three million people were listening to me and my music and loving me for exactly who I was, which I'd never had before. The DJs on Radio Rock didn't care if I smoked too many cigarettes or played too much Jimi Hendrix. They, too, loved me for who I was, not who they wanted me to be. I wouldn't have gone back to Mum for the world. Dad knew that, too, and it was funny to watch his face every time he mentioned her, which he did compulsively at first, then relaxed and started to let it go. Today he seemed nervous somehow, and I considered the fact that I could tell some sort of momentous induction into the tribe of Radio Rock . Quentin had this air of ease and class about him, an impeccable calm that was impossible to shake. \"Court,\" he said casually, the two of us ensconced cosily in his cabin drinking Cognac, \"how would you feel if my godson Carl came to live with us?\" \"Do I know Carl?\" I asked; he was asking as though I might object. \"No.\" \"So why are you asking me? You didn't ask everyone if it was all right when I turned up, did you? You didn't even tell them I was coming!\" \"No,\" he replied. \"But you're my daughter and I felt like I should ask you first.\" I smiled. \"Would now be an appropriate time to tell you that I love you?\" He smiled back and patted my hand assuredly. \"I wanted so badly to make a good impression on you. I wanted to be a real father to you, you know?\" \"Well, you succeeded,\" I replied lightly. The rush of affection I was feeling for my old man spilled out of my mouth cheesily. \"You're the best father I could ever imagine. Honest, Dad. So, what's Carl like?\" \"I don't know,\" he said, chuckling. \"I've never met him.\" I left twenty minutes later feeling thoroughly touched. I'd never felt like Mum thought I was anything more than a burden, but Dad treated me like a princess even before we met. And even though I was twenty-five years old now, it still felt good to be somebody's angel. Daddy's girl through and through, I turned out to be. Outside the cabin, I walked straight into the Count. \"Whoa, watch it, girlie,\" he said, picking me up and putting me back on my feet. I don't know why he called me girlie; an American thing, I guess. \"So, what's going on?\" I grinned; the Count knew that the best way to get the latest news was to ask me. \"Daddy's godson Carl's mother apparently had the same idea as mine, so he's coming to live on the boat… hey,\" I said suddenly as the thought struck me, \"is there enough room?\" \"Yeah, he can bunk with Thick Kevin.\" I smiled, imagining what bunking with Thick Kevin would be like. \"I actually came down here to let you guys know dinner's up.\" \"Wow,\" I said. \"You came all this way just to tell us that there was food where you came from? Talk about a workout.\" I poked his expanse of stomach. He chuckled dryly. \"Well, you don't eat enough,\" he replied, poking my stomach in turn. I tensed. \"Jesus, that's hard. Do you do sit-,ups in your room or something?\" I snorted. \"Hardly. I swim, you know that. It's really not that hard,\" I teased. He looked down at himself ruefully. \"And I don't think you thought it over when you came down.\" \"Why's that?\" \"Getting down the stairs is the easy part. It's going back up.\" He looked back up the stairs and I could see my friendly jibe reflected in his lively eyes. I liked the Count; he had an easy, laid-back manner and was extremely easy to wind up. He'd been new on the boat when I was, a replacement for the great Gavin Kavanagh that I'd been so desperate to meet. He teased me flirtatiously, but I always knew he wasn't the slightest bit serious about wanting to screw me. I slapped his stomach again and darted up the stairs; his surprised laugh followed me eerily, but he didn't take the bait. Back on deck, the nightly game, Charades tonight, was in full swing. Everyone held plates laden with bacon butties, the oil seeping quietly through the bread. I could have kissed Felicity. Her bacon sandwiches were to die for. I grabbed the Count's plate off the benchtop. \"I love you, Felicity,\" I told her earnestly. She smiled meekly, noticing that I hadn't taken my usual plate but saying nothing. I sat down between Dave and Simon. Dave ignored me; Simon took one look at my plate and laughed. \"Can you fit all that in your little stomach?\" he asked. \"I don't know,\" I replied truthfully, \"but I'm going to try.\" He grinned. \"And besides, I always know you'll carry me to bed if I eat so much I can't move.\" \"All right!\" Dave cried exuberantly. \"My turn!\" He bounced up and took a card. The floor shook as he jumped up and landed heavily. \"Earthquake,\" I guessed. He gave me a scathing look and repeated the gesture with one foot. \"Jump.\" \"Land?\" \"Stamp.\" I looked up as the Count walked in with Quentin. I shrank back in my seat and took a huge bite of my sandwich, trying not to sigh with pleasure. The Count noticed straightaway. \"Courtenay,\" he said, picking up the larger of the two plates and advancing on me threateningly \"I believe you have something that belongs to me.\" I shook my head, my mouth full. \"Nope.\" I fully expected him to retaliate, but to my surprise, he laughed and went to sit in an armchair. Dave had stopped his jumping at the Count's 'stamp' guess and now had his hand curled around his groin as though relieving himself, exaggerating the gesture until all of us immature people were nearly doing it ourselves with laughter. \"Pee,\" the Count suggested calmly. It was a clear sign that our conversation was over, which left me defeated and put out with the mother of all bacon sandwiches on my knee. I took another bite happily and let the taste smother my tongue; it wouldn't be the mother of all bacon sandwiches for long. Dave was motioning for more with one hand while still gripping his imaginary penis with the other. \"Peeing?\" Simon tried hopefully. Dave mime-zipped his fly. \"Peed!\" Angus cried. I jumped up. \"Stampede!\" \"Yes!\" I triumphantly minced to the scoreboard and drew up points under mine and Dave's name. Much later, Angus, Simon and Dave carried me to bed, and life on Radio Rock progressed as normal. A/N: Yes? Working? Next chapter I'm taking the idea from the deleted scene 'Eggs' from the movie and I'll steadily work my way through all 12 or so of the ones I can incorporate in, somehow or another. No, I'm not just going to re-tell the story of the film with an extra character added in; the only event I think I'll go over in any detail is Simon and Elenor's marriage and split etc, and that just to build Gavin's character. I don't foresee any slash or pairings of any kind, really. Just platonic. Review with feedback/suggestions and I will send a picture of a cookie or a cake to you; if you give a really detailed review I'll send both. OK? See you next time! -for you![Chapter 2] A/N: It's very difficult to type with a broken and very sticky 'o' key. Especially when you have a character called the Count. Unfortunate. If I did slip up anywhere in this or the last chapter, let me know. My rating covers the F word by principle because there are so many of them in the movie, but the Count-without-an-o word is something else entirely. It was raining when Carl arrived. I tried not to think of it as a sign. It happened without incident: one moment I'd never met him, the next I had, and that was it. He ticked all the right boxes in the 'lifestyle' department, kicked out of school for smoking pot, also smoked cigarettes, had nothing to live for back on land. I liked him straightaway. He wasn't much to look at, though, young Carl. The awkwardness of pubescence still hung about his limbs, and he was skinny in a way that suggested malnourishment rather than exercise. I smiled at the thought of the fun Felicity was going to have feeding him up. The crew started testing him as soon as they saw him. He turned out sort of average; could hold his breath longer than the Count but not as long as me, could rap better than Angus but not as well as Simon. His common sense, though, was disappointing. His first real test, the subtle but cruel one, came on a sunny Sunday, three days after he arrived. I was inside, having a staring competition with Simon while John tapped on his typewriter in the background. Simon was unnaturally good at staring competitions. He didn't seem to have to blink as much as a normal human being. I was therefore determined to beat him someday, but it didn't look like that day was going to be today. My eyes were starting to water. I was just about to give up when the door banged open and I started. Unfortunately, for me, starting meant blinking and Simon crowed with triumph. I scowled and turned to Dave, who had interrupted. \"Putting the two halves of our conversation together,\" he continued, and Carl followed him in, \"I will give you ten pounds, if you will let me break four of these eggs,\" he held up a six-pack carton, \"on your head.\" \"Ooh, ten English pounds,\" Simon backed pointedly. I opened my mouth to tell him not to do it, but then stopped; I knew this test. Dave had done it on me, too, and I knew that Carl would be a fool to trust him. If it was me, I'd want to be left to make my own decisions. \"Wait,\" said Carl slowly, \"so, ten pounds, four eggs,\" he held up four fingers, looking like he couldn't quite believe his ears, \"on my head.\" He pointed to it. I bit my lip. He was going to fall for it. \"On your head,\" Dave repeated. \"Do we have a deal?\" I shook my head slightly, involuntarily; Simon grabbed my arm, his fingernails digging into my wrist painfully. \"Don't,\" he hissed. \"Absolute deal!\" Carl agreed, holding out his hand. Dave took it delightedly. \"Wow,\" he said, not quite believing that he'd actually said yes. \"If you'd like to come this way…\" he led Carl to a seat in front of the dinner table. Simon leapt excitedly to sit behind the table, dragging me with him. \"Can I take my jacket off?\" Carl asked. \"Absolutely, yeah,\" Dave replied. \"Corduroy and eggs… uh-uh.\" I scratched my head awkwardly. John came and sat next to me, looking as though he felt the same way I did. \"You just sit down there.\" Carl put his jacket down and sat in the chair. \"Ok. Egg Number One:\" He held it up. I was vaguely aware of Angus as he walked in, looking like he'd just won the lottery. Then Dave brought the egg down on Carl's stupid head with a resounding crack . I have to admit, hearing the egg break and seeing the expression on his face as the yolk ran down his forehead and into his eyes was enormously satisfying. It was that cruel, satisfying pleasure when you watch someone else pay the price for a mistake you, too, made long ago. I still wasn't looking forward to the end, but Egg One wasn't so bad. Simon slowly let go of my arm. Thick Kevin walked in, wearing his usual vacantly interested expression. \"Ten pounds, eh?\" Dave said happily, stretching out the moment, enjoying the pain. \"You could buy seven albums with that –\" \"Yeah, sorry, but could we get this over with, please, because it's not very nice,\" Carl interrupted, trying not to open his mouth too wide. My hand twitched; Simon grabbed it again. \"Yeah, absolutely,\" Dave said, though he sounded slightly guilty now. He held up the second egg like a magician insisting there's no trickery in his act. \"Egg Two.\" Crack . A few of the boys reacted this time with short intakes of breath. It was mesmerizing, watching him sit there and take it, pound-signs reflected in his pupils. I wanted to look away, but somehow found myself watching anyway, just as enthralled as everyone else. \"Egg Number Three,\" Dave said, obeying Carl's wish to get it over with. \" Oeuf Toi .\" Crack. I was almost holding my breath, nauseated with remembered sensation as the egg dripped across his forehead. Everyone gasped this time, a few 'eew's escaping too. I wrenched my arm out of Simon's grasp and put my head in my hands. \"You know what?\" said Dave, his voice slightly muffled through my fingers, \"I shan't cast Egg Four.\" \"What?\" \"I think I'll just… leave it there…\" I looked up as he put it back in the carton gently. My pity for Carl as I saw his face made me want to shove that egg down Dave's trousers. \"So… so I get… seven pounds, ten shillings, then?\" Carl asked, crestfallen. \"No. You see, the deal was, four eggs, ten pounds; we didn't make any three-egg deal.\" Carl looked at us, looking so horrified that my heart almost broke. \"Wait, you're…\" he laughed nervously, \"you're joking.\" Dave laughed too. \"No.\" \"Yeah,\" Simon agreed. \"You should have made a deal for three eggs.\" \"Always make the three-egg deal,\" John added sadly. \"You're too greedy, mate!\" Angus offered delightedly. \"You shouldn't have trusted the asshole!\" I exploded angrily. \"That is so unbelievably unfair,\" Carl said unnecessarily, looking as though he was about to go into shock. \"It is unfair,\" Dave answered. \"And that's the important lesson I was trying to teach you – life is unfair.\" He started a round of applause, which the others joined. I looked around in surprise at how many of us were there; everyone but Harold, the Count and Mark, who were about to switch shifts at broadcasting, and Quentin. Kevin had that look on his face like he thought he was being intelligent but didn't quite know why he was clapping. \"You are a bastard,\" stated Simon. Dave smiled awkwardly. \"Well, it may seem that way, but I think you'll find I'm a nice guy really, under… underneath…\" he looked around, laughing nervously, the clapping gone, as the general opinion took a shift against him. Simon laughed too. \"Way underneath.\" \"Well,\" I said, sensing my moment, \"lesson learned, don't you think?\" the others nodded. I vaulted the table, picked up Egg Four and turned to look at Dave. He seemed to think it was destined for his head; he cowered. I stood there for a moment, letting him sweat, then in one movement turned and brought the egg down on Carl's head. \"I'll pay your ten fucking quid.\" I made to walk out, but found the Count blocking the doorway. \"What you do now, Dave, is you tell her you'll give her twenty if she'll lick it all off.\" I composed my game face and turned back to the Doctor. Poor Carl looked absolutely terrified; he really was having a hard time of his first week. Dave also glanced at him. \"I'd love to, but I wouldn't do that to Young Carl.\" I narrowed my eyes viciously at him. \"All right, Doctor Dave,\" I said, camping up the defeated-villain look, \"I'll let you have the last laugh this time.\" I threw the Count a not-this-time look, turned and walked out, smiling a little smile to myself; his last laugh would be very short-lived indeed. \"He did that to me, too, you know,\" I said kindly, handing Carl a tenner. He smiled, a genuine, rogueish sort of smile that I instantly liked. \"You don't have to,\" he said, not taking the banknote. \"No, seriously, take it,\" I insisted, reaching past his hands and stuffing it in his coat pocket. \"Okay, then,\" he said, holding up his hands in surrender. I grinned approvingly and sat down on a deckchair. We were topside, looking out at the waves. It was Wednesday and twilight was falling; the water sparkled as though a thousand diamonds had been cast carelessly across the sea. He sat down next to me. I offered him a cigarette and lit one myself. \"So what happened?\" \"When?\" I blew a stream of smoke out and watched it dissipate. \"When Dave did the thing with the eggs to you.\" I laughed. \"Oh.\" I paused, remembering. \"I wasn't too bummed. I didn't really think he'd give it to me, right from the start, you know? I did it more to show them that I was game than anything else. I was laughing it off when Dad showed up. He paid me in the end.\" Carl laughed too. \"I can't really imagine the guy who owns this having a daughter,\" he mused. \"One-night stand,\" I explained shortly. \"Mum can't even remember what he looks like.\" I took another drag and eyed my exhalations critically. \"He's a good father, though. I first wrote to him when I was seven, and he wrote back, no questions asked. Sent me awesome presents every Christmas and birthday, records mostly.\" I held out my foot. \"He gave me these the birthday before he invited me here.\" \"They're cool,\" Carl said hesitantly, looking at my black pirate-boots. I laughed at his obvious lack of women's-fashion-knowledge. There was silence for a while, but a comfortable one that I didn't feel the need to fill at all. \"So what do you think of it? The boat, I mean?\" \"It's home,\" I said simply. He looked at me expectantly, so I expanded. \"I love it. I belong here. I have a proper family, and I can listen to music all day without people yelling at me to turn it off or turn it down…\" \"So you are here because of the music?\" \"You can't not be,\" I told him. \"I never understood how people can not like rock. It…\" I struggled for words to express the life that came purely from rock and roll. \"It's the only thing that makes sense of the world. It's life , it's energy, it's… fuck, I wouldn't get up in the morning if I didn't have rock and roll.\" \"Okay,\" said Carl gently. \"So… a lot of passion there.\" I laughed. \"There is nothing on this earth that can make you feel as good, as fast, as Hold me, love me, hold me, love me, I ain't got nothing but love, babe, eight days a week… \" \"All right, fair enough.\" Carl created a rather pregnant pause. \"How did you end up here?\" I giggled at the memory. \"Mum got sick of me lying on her couch because of my measly lifeguard salary and blasting my disrespectful junk of a record collection through her house, so she pulled the final threat and sent me to lie on Dad's couch instead. I don't think she knew that she was actually fulfilling my dreams and sending me to live with my heroes….\" He caught the irony and laughed. \"Sorry if this is becoming a bit like 20 Questions, but… who's your favorite DJ?\" \"That's okay.\" I thought. \"Simon. He's not afraid to make a complete arse of himself on the radio for the sake of comedy. And it works, he's funny. People love him. He never makes jokes at other people's expense, which seems to be the basis of everyone else's humor; he never swears, and he's so innocent it's gorgeous.\" I flicked ash over the deckrail. \"Next question.\" He chuckled languidly, leaned back in the deckchair and put his feet up. \"Have you ever met Gavin Kavanagh?\" \"No.\" I followed his gesture. \"I always wanted to, though. He was amazing… did you listen to him back then?\" Carl nodded. \"I thought – I hoped – he'd come back one day, but he never did. The Count's a part of the furniture now.\" \"What's with you and the Count, too? You guys seem to be… edgy.\" \"Oh, I wouldn't say that. It's called war.\" He looked at me in surprise. \"No, just kidding. It's nothing. We make a big show of it, but it is just show. He's only pretending to be mad because I teased him about his weight a week ago.\" \"So you guys are good friends?\" \"Well,\" I replied musingly, \"I wouldn't take his side in an argument unless it was against someone I really hated, but we're not really enemies. He's just easy to wind up.\" Carl tried to look like he understood, but I could tell he didn't. It was a while before he began again. \"What's your favorite song?\" \"I don't know.\" Again, he waited for me to expand. \"I like soft rock, you know, like Bread and those sorts of artists. Bread's song Look What You've Done is awesome. The Stones are good. I love Wild Horses. Oh, and the Beatles are genius, of course.\" \" Wild Horses ?\" I hummed a few bars for him. \"Oh. Yeah, that's not bad.\" \"Good guitar riff.\" \"Do you play the guitar?\" He suddenly sounded really interested. \"I tried to learn, but I'm ridiculously bad.\" \"I taught myself back at Mum's, but I was only borrowing the guitar from a friend of mine, and he wouldn't let me take it on the boat.\" Carl smiled wryly. \"Friend?\" I returned the smile. \"Okay, boyfriend. Well, he was. He wasn't too keen on the idea of me living on a boat full of guys without him, so I broke it off. He wasn't worth more than this.\" \"Sorry.\" I shrugged. \"I saw you swimming yesterday, do you do that often?\" \"All the time,\" I answered. \"I love water. I think I must have been a fish in a previous life, if you believe in that sort of thing.\" He laughed absently. \"Okay, last question.\" \"Is it, already?\" he asked surprisedly. \"I don't know,\" I replied. \"I wasn't counting. Were you counting?\" \"No,\" he admitted, \"but I'm sure I've got at least two more.\" \"All right then, two more.\" \"Okay – one: have you or would you ever sleep with anyone on the boat?\" I chuckled. \"No. Even if I did find any of them remotely attractive, Dad'd send me back to Mum, who would refuse to take me back and I'd actually have to support myself for the first time in my life.\" \"Even Mark?\" he probed. \"Is that your last question?\" \"No! It's just… an add-on to the last one! Don't answer it if it's going to count.\" I giggled. \"Yep. Even Mark. I'd love to know how he does it, but not first-hand. So what's your last question?\" \"Oh, God,\" he said slowly. \"I have no idea.\" His eyes fell to the cigarette in his hand. \"Why do you smoke?\" he asked. I gazed at my own, considering. \"I started because it felt good. You know, knowing that I was doing something Mum would have killed me for if she could have overpowered me. And now…\" \"Habit?\" \"No, actually. I think if smoking gives you lung cancer I'd get it anyway here because everyone else does it. You can't be in a room with five smokers and not breathe in enough smoke to equal having your own cigarette, so you might as well save the trouble of being the odd one out.\" \"I won't quit, then.\" There was a pensive silence for a few seconds. \"I like you, Carl. You remind me of myself.\" He snorted. The silence descended again. Then I snapped it like a rubber band. \"Right! My turn!\" He groaned and rolled over slightly so he faced me. I decided to start with a subtle but revealing question. \"Do you like peas?\" A /N: If you're wondering, no, Carl doesn't like peas. I decided. Too mushy. I'm afraid my updates won't always be this fast, but it's the weekend and I had Friday off work too, so I've been bored. And all I've been able to do is write, type, and watch movies, because it's rained. Oh, and I have homework, but that doesn't count for the Master of Procrastination. That's me, by the way. Only one cookie awarded so far, disappointing :( not that I can get the link to paste into the message anyway, I wonder if it's just that my computer hates me. It's old and probably needs a rest. I'm scared, though, that if I give it a holiday it won't want to start work again... what can I say? I can't win. Please review, it would totally make my day. -for you![Chapter 3] Ok. I am going to purposefully use the Count-without-an-o word twice in this chapter. Sorry about this. You see it coming the first time, so just read that bit with your eyes shut, and the second bit is in Quentin's cabin. So sorry – it's not something I like to say myself on a regular basis, although I noticed I use it a lot more now that I'm writing this… anyway. Enjoy this new chapter – more plot summary than usual, sorry. Next chapter is ninety-nine percent mine (Court's birthday aaand the King is coming! No, not Elvis, you dolts. Iiit's…. Gavin Kavanagh! Yaay! -for you! The Kinks were playing so loud that I didn't even hear the girls arrive. It was Saturday, and I was broadcasting; I always did the Saturday midday slot purely because of Sensational Saturday. Apparently, being both Quentin's daughter and female, I could invite someone onto the boat at any time, but I tried to avoid Saturdays. I felt sorry for Carl - he had found out about the event only yesterday and had had no time to think up an excuse for not having anyone to bring. So it was Carl, Simon, John, Felicity and I who sat forlornly in the boiler room in silence. Felicity, as usual, immersed herself in dough. I baked cookies with Carl to show him my mastery in the art of procrastination. Then, a warm choc-chip cookie in my hand, I settled down to the unpleasant task. \"You know,\" Simon said suddenly, breaking the silence that had grown in the room, this really is a very interesting book.\" I looked at it: My Year With The Woodpeckers. \"Is it?\" asked Carl languidly. \"Oh, yeah. You see my father used to collect woodpeckers.\" \"Did he really?\" \"Yeah! No,\" I snorted. \"It sounds enthralling. I envy you.\" He gave me a scathing look that plainly said he didn't believe me. \"No, seriously, I do. I'm writing to my mother.\" \"Oh,\" Simon said knowledgeably. \"Fair enough.\" \"Why?\" Carl asked. \"Just thanking her for my birthday present that she sent me.\" \"Oh, when was your birthday?\" Something in his camera clicked into place. \"It's not until Tuesday, but she's super-organised.\" I saw a thoughtful expression cross Carl's angular face. \"So what was it?\" \"Better than normal,\" I rejoined quickly. \"I think she finally wants me back.\" Simon laughed sarcastically. The Count walked past with twin blondes in cowboy hats. I tried not to laugh. He made it up two steps towards his cabin, then stopped. \"Oh, Simon –\" he came back down and pulled something from his back jeans pocket – \"I might not be up first thing in the morning, so I thought I'd give this to you now.\" Simon took it warily. \"Just something I've been thinking about.\" He ushered the twins up the stairs again. \"Now, do you two mind if I call you by the same name? Twins can be kind of confusing.\" \"You can call us anything you want,\" one of them replied. He shot us a look like he thought he was extremely lucky. \"Oh, Jesus… Um… Fred?\" I rushed over to Simon and looked at the piece of paper. Blowjob . \"Oh, that's original,\" I shouted after him. \"Real mature.\" \"Hey, you shut up or I'll give you a word that just can't be said on national radio,\" he replied. \"Fat?\" His only reply was a glimpse of his middle finger as he followed the twins up the stairs. I smiled wryly. \"Wait!\" I called up after him. He stopped again. \"I'll say the word you're thinking of if you'll say 'fuck' for your Very Foolish Thing.\" There was a pause. \"All right. If you're good.\" Then he was gone. \"What's this?\" Carl asked. \"What's with the Count and his little bit of paper?\" \"Oh, it's nothing, just a sort of old tradition. The Count gives us a word every day that we have to try and fit into our broadcast without anyone noticing. On Monday it's really easy, like a food or an obscene animal, but by Sunday it's… it's pretty hard.\" \"So can I see what it is? Can I see?\" \"Oh, it's not… it's just… blowjob.\" \"Wow.\" Carl took the piece of paper and looked at it, grinning. \"It's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it,\" Simon said resignedly. I chuckled. \"You think you've got it bad, did you hear what I just agreed to do? Fuck, that was stupid.\" Simon patted me on the back. \"I think I can trump that,\" John said awkwardly. \"The Count said he's going to give me fellatio.\" I blinked. Nobody said anything as we all wondered whether we'd heard that right. \"What was that now, John?\" \"I mean – not that, I mean in a note, you know…\" \"Oh,\" Carl said relievedly. \"Right.\" I was still helpless with giggles. \"So what are you going to do?\" \"I was thinking of pretending he was the Prime Minister of Italy,\" he said, convulsing me back into stitches. \"Seńor Fel- eh -tio?\" I fell off the chair next to Simon. \"It's not funny, Courtenay!\" Dave walked in. \"Ooh,\" he said, taking in John's pained expression and ignoring me writhing on the floor, \"sad room.\" He mimed crying and sat down opposite Carl. I collected myself enough to sit up again. Dave looked at Carl seriously. \"I've come to get you out of your predicament,\" he said. Carl looked innocent. \"What predicament?\" \"The whole 'sad-act, no-girl, unused-pencil-sized-penis' predicament.\" I snorted again. \"Oh,\" said Carl awkwardly. \"Walk this way,\" said Dave, and left the way he had come. I sobered. \"Oh, no, he's not, is he?\" I said. But I knew Dave; he almost definitely was going to do what I thought he was doing. \"No,\" said Simon. \"Don' walk that way.\" Carl looked at me uncertainly. I shrugged. \"You want my opinion? It's not going to work. You might as well try, though, right?\" \"No,\" Simon repeated as Carl stood up. \"No, walk – walk woodpecker way.\" Even Carl snorted. \"Just go,\" I told him. \"It might be fun.\" A few minutes later, I subtly walked past Dave's cabin on the way to my own and paused a few seconds. I was just about to assume the 'plan' had worked when I heard a scream. \"Aah! No! Wrong room… sorry.\" Before I could react, the door in front of me opened and Carl walked out, naked as the day he was born, clutching his genitals. I cracked up laughing and hastily averted my eyes. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Nothing!\" I defended. \"I'm sorry – I'm not looking – I was just on my way back to my room and I heard you scream…\" He stood there for a few seconds while I laughed, then he snorted pathetically too. \"Shut up,\" he said good-naturedly. \"Come on.\" Simon started out his Super Sunday Smashes with a record by Whistling Jack Smith. Carl and I sat outside the recording studio, watching through the glass, listening. \"So what word were you going to say tonight?\" Carl asked me. I looked at him. \"I'll give you a clue. I don't usually say it, and it starts with 'c'.\" \"Oh.\" Simon started to talk and we shut up pronto. \"We're going to start out with a record by Whistling Jack Smith. And for any of you who don't know how to whistle, it's simple: just put your lips together and blow–job done!\" He looked at us with his arms raised questioningly. I grinned and waggled my fingers at him in a 'so-so' gesture. John was up next with the news and weather. I was laughing before he even walked into the studio. John's Sunday broadcasts were always the best; he was so serious and the Count unfailingly gave him words like 'cock' that just didn't fit into the News. \"And the Italian liner, Michelangelo, was today launched. Prime Minister Seńor Fellatio was in attendance.\" Felicity joined us with popcorn to hear Dave's broadcast around lunchtime. He was busy announcing the winner of a competition they'd had running. \"And it is a great night for everyone on board Radio Rock but especially for our competition winner! Harold, drumroll please!\" Harold struck up a vigorous beat on the desk. \"And the winner is… Miss Phyllida Nyss!\" He made cheering noises. \"Hang on – is that Phyllida or Phillipa, Harold?\" Harold looked at the piece of paper, which looked suspiciously like it came from the Count's back pocket. \"No? All right, well, let's not take any risks, shall we? The lucky winner – who will be joining the other ninety-nine lucky winners on board the Triumph trip to the boat next Saturday – is Miss Penis.\" I shook my head sadly. Dave put on a hoarse, Gavin-Kavanagh-type voice. \"Radio Rock, 203, enjoy this tune.\" He put on a record and flicked off his mike. \"Penis, done and dusted,\" he said triumphantly. I kept shaking my head. Pathetic. \"Harold, file that under 'Penis.'\" John leaned over me towards the window. \"No, Dave, we're not sure about that.\" \"Why?\" \"Pathetic, mate. Penis. You can do better than that.\" I joined John in giving Dave the thumbs-down. \"Yeah, well, it's penis, isn't it –\" \"Yeah, but anyone could just say…\" Felicity said doubtfully. \"All right, everyone's a critic,\" Dave replied huffily. \"Disappointing, Dave,\" I said. \"Disappointing.\" The clock wound down slowly. I usually slept in on Sundays because I broadcasted late, but I'd got up at six that morning to watch Simon fit 'blowjob' into his broadcast. By the time Mark stepped into the studio, Carl's eyes were drooping and my stomach hurt from yawning too much. \"Hey, Mark,\" I said as he entered, \"what's your word?\" He stopped. \"Fuck,\" he said absently. I wondered for a second if that was his word, but then he shrugged. I grinned. I think he played slow music to deliberately put me to sleep. My head almost hit Carl's shoulder several times. \"And now, one of my favorite tracks,\" he said dreamily, \"recorded on November the 8th 1956, from the famous…\" he pulled a slip of the Count's paper from his pocket and his mouth twitched as he read it, \"…Cocksucker Sessions.\" I laughed. \"What a gathering that must have been.\" I started a round of applause. Irritating Mark's slow, dreamy manner may have been, but nothing fazed him. He didn't even break a sweat. The others joined in as he and I switched places. The Count pointed at his eyes, then mine as I sat down in the chair and put on the headphones decorated with peace-sign stickers. I stifled a yawn. Fuck. How was I going to be able to think straight enough to slip the 'c' word into my show when I could hardly keep my eyes open? Then, as another yawn took violent possession of my mouth, I had an idea. It wasn't brilliant, but I thought it was better than 'Miss Penis'. I shot the Count a look as I switched on my intro and my mike. \"And the time is… um, eleven pm on Sunday night and I'm half-asleep because I got up to listen to Simple Simon's Sunday Smashes! If any of you guys missed it that's too bad because it was a doozy, folks. But now eleven's getting a bit much for me and I'll have to get someone to wake me up at the end of each record, thank God I'm only on for an hour tonight. \"And another thing to thank Him for is that I don't live on the mainland, because then I'd have to drive home and driving while drowsy is very dangerous, guys. Very dangerous. I hear coppers nowadays are actually attempting to make it illegal in this cunt,\" I said it with finality so that it was noticeable, then faked another huge yawn. \"Country. Sorry. Anyway, just in case any of you listeners are nodding off at the wheel, here's something to wake us all up: the new record from Stevie Winwood, Gimme Some Lovin'!\" I flicked it on and dared a tentative look through the glass. Felicity did the thumbs up. Harold was grinning all over his childish face. Carl nodded, but with an 'all right' smile on his face. The looks everywhere were generally approving. The Count looked crestfallen. I pointed my middle and index fingers at him and mimed pulling the trigger of a gun. Courtenay: 1, Count: 0. By Monday, of course, I'd forgotten all about the deal. I was having lunch with Dad in his cabin and discussing how nicely Carl was fitting in when I heard the Count's voice on the radio. \"All right, this was the deal: I asked all of you to demand of me to do a Vey Foolish Thing,\" the radio gave him a musical stab in the background. I stood up. \"Oh, shit,\" I said. \"I forgot.\" Dad looked at me. \"What?\" \"The Count and I had a deal that if I said… something… last night, he'd say 'fuck' for his Foolish Thing.\" There was a pause. Then Dad stood up too. \"He can't do that. He can't actually say 'fuck' on national radio.\" \"Why not? John did it last Sunday. I said 'cunt' yesterday.\" \"Yes, I heard that,\" he gave me a severe look, \"But you covered it up, albeit badly. He's about to make a grand pomp and ceremony about it.\" He walked out of the cabin. \"I'm sorry, but I can't let him do it.\" I followed him hurriedly. \"But Dad –\" I shut up and listened to the radio. \"You sent in ideas in their millions and one idea has trumped them all. But the real reason I'm doing this today is for the wonderfully charismatic Courtenay, because it is her birthday tomorrow, and I wanted to do something special.\" \"See, Daddy? He's doing it for my birthday. Please?\" \"I'm sorry, darling, but the government will shut us down.\" I continued to protest until we reached the studio; the Count had just started the ceremonious process of the 'f' sound at the beginning of the word when Dad opened the door, swiping his hand across his neck. \"Fff… first, though,\" the Count covered hesitantly, \"this very fine piece of music.\" He slapped the Hollies on and turned to face Quentin expectantly. \"You can't do this.\" \"Why not?\" he asked indignantly. \"It's just a word! Courtenay said worse yesterday!\" \"Charming thought, but the simple situation is that the authorities already dislike us,\" said Dad matter-of-factly, \"and if you do this then they will hate us and by hook or by crook they will find a way to close us down.\" \"Uh, they can't close us down,\" the Count replied. \"We're pirates. That's why we're sitting out here in the middle of the freaking ocean!\" There were a few cries of 'hear, hear' from outside. I personally enjoyed living in the middle of the ocean, but I kept quiet about that. \"Believe me, they will find a way. Governments loathe anyone being free.\" I began clasping my hands together in a begging gesture and mouthing the word 'please' behind his back. The others outside were making noises of disgust. \"Okay,\" the Count said reluctantly, moving back to the desk. I sighed and went to sit with the others. Quentin looked at his mistrustfully. \"Okay, I'm thinking about it,\" he said. Dad folded his arms and leaned patiently against the doorframe. I grabbed a handful of popcorn from Simon. \"He'd better do it,\" I muttered. \"I did not say the 'c' word yesterday for nothing.\" Simon patted me sympathetically on the back. \"Okay,\" the Count said again. He turned the Hollies down and his mike up. \"My dear comrades,\" he said officially, \"I have some sad news. The powers that be have decreed that the 'f' word is a word too far; but at least, even though our dreams of freedom have died a tragic death, the Hollies are still alive.\" He turned them up again. I felt like crying; so, the Count had won after all. \"Thank you,\" Dad said sadly. I noticed that the Count had turned the mike towards Quentin. \"I don't know why you did that,\" he said. \"I was just going to say 'fuck' once. Just one tiny little 'fuck'.\" I gleefully registered that he was tilting his head towards the mike as he spoke. I whispered as much to Carl and Simon. \"There's no such thing as a 'tiny little fuck',\" Dad replied. I was now trying to keep giggles in. Dave, in the other studio with his headphones on, piped up, \"yeah, there is; you should ask Angus's girlfriend.\" Angus made an indignant noise. \"Be that as it may,\" Dad maintained, \"there's no fucks this morning that won't fuck us up.\" I snorted once, painfully, as I tried not to give the game away. This was getting good. \"One day, in a world of dreams, we'll be able to say 'wank' or 'bollocks' or even 'cock' on the radio,\" I'd said all of those words seriously before and began to shrink in my chair, \"but 'fuck'? Never.\" I tapped Harold and nodded. Now, I thought, was the time to end it. He ran around to the door. \"Excuse me, your Lordship,\" he said apologetically. \"Yes, Harold,\" the Count said innocently. He knew exactly what was going on and for that split second, I loved him for it. \"You've left your mike up in the studio.\" \"Oh!\" he looked at the mike that he'd lifted up with one finger to catch Dad's voice better. \"So I have. Uh…\" I stood up and clapped enthusiastically while the others laughed. \"I, uh… I do apologise to everyone out there for the four… was it five?\" I nodded and held up five fingers, \"five 'f' words, Quentin.\" He laughed. \"Uh,\" another spate of chuckles disturbed his speech. \"The Hollies will continue undisturbed.\" I started to feel slightly bad for Daddy, who looked thoroughly pissed. \"Gee, I'm really sorry about that, Quentin. You sounded good, though, you have a lovely voice for radio…\" He petered out. \"Fuck off.\" I snorted as Dad walked out and the Count turned back to the mike. \"That makes it six… and it couldn't have turned out better, in my opinion.\" He looked at me and saluted me clumsily. I returned the gesture. \"Happy birthday, Courtenay.\"[Chapter 4] \" Courtenay! Wake the fuck up!\" The Count. Did I mention how much I hated him? I'm not overly fond of anyone at – I glanced at the clock – six fifteen in the fucking morning, but the Count just knew how to wind me up that much tighter than everyone else. It was my birthday. I had a right to sleep in. \"COURTENAY! TWENTY-SIX YEAR-OLD WOMEN ARE USUALLY AWAKE BY NOW!\" What was he using to make his voice that loud? Did he have a megaphone, or had he lugged the studio mike all the way up to my cabin? \"FUCK OFF!\" I yelled back. \"Twenty-six year old birthday girls usually sleep in.\" I could just lie there and put up with his yelling at me, but that would probably annoy me more than it did him. I sat up and pulled on a pair of shorts and a jumper. If they were waking me up this early, it meant they'd actually done something for my birthday. Probably Felicity had cooked breakfast. Bacon sandwiches. Ha-ha. I tiptoed to the door then flung it open, hoping to catch the Count but missing rather badly. It bounced off the wall and I caught it before it hit me instead. \"Morning,\" I said to the entire crew of DJs that stood outside my door. They had carted the studio mike down to my cabin, and all the other radio equipment. John was broadcasting on one mike, Simon on the other, and they all looked at me expectantly. I took Simon's mike. \"Morning, world,\" I said lightly. \"It's a beautiful day to turn twenty-six, and thanks, everyone who sent me letters and squashed chocolates and things, they were very much appreciated. This is the only broadcasting I'll be doing today, so… thank you all so much, I love you dearly, and Simon, I'd love you to play Bread in celebration…\" I smiled at him hopefully. He grinned back and flicked the switch on the record that was already on the turntable. Truckin' started playing. I hugged him. \"So now that you're awake,\" the Count said, grinning smugly and putting his megaphone down carefully. \"Can we finally eat the breakfast we've been smelling?\" I beamed. \"Breakfast would be… lovely.\" Sure enough, the boat smelled of bacon from the bottom of the kitchen stairs. I sniffed gleefully. So did Dave. \"Happy birthday, Court,\" he said, with enough enthusiasm to almost make me suspicious. \"I love the way you love the same food I do.\" \"And I love the way she's still about a third of your size, mate,\" Angus chipped in. I loved that too, but I just laughed and boarded the stairs. Felicity gave me a 'happy birthday' and a sumptuous bacon sandwich. We ate breakfast together for once, and throughout the whole affair I got the feeling that they were holding something back, trying to keep it from me. I put down my knife and fork with finality. \"What?\" They all looked up in mock-surprise. \"What… what?\" \"What… no!\" I said loudly, about to get caught up in the game. \"You're all acting funny.\" I looked at the Count, usually the ringleader, and for some reason, he looked at Carl. The boy's eyes widened and he raised his hands innocently. \"What are you looking at me for?\" he asked indignantly. I raised an eyebrow. He met my gaze for a few seconds, showing unusual resolve, then relented. \"All right,\" he said finally. \"There's a surprise for you in the downstairs cabin.\" I was pleasantly surprised. \"Really?\" He nodded. \"What kind of surprise?\" \"A nice one, hopefully,\" Carl replied nonchalantly, picking up his plate and standing up. \"Shall we go check it out?\" I followed suit; so did everyone else, which drew my attention again to how many of us there were. I glanced around. \"Who's broadcasting?\" \"We taped a show last night, I'm just playing it back,\" Simon offered, shrugging. \"I wanted to see this.\" I smiled again. It sounded like some surprise. \"All right. Let's go.\" The downstairs cabin was dark, only half-light daring to show through the high portholes on the far side. I flicked on the electric light, flinching automatically. I don't know what I was expecting, but the room wasn't full of balloons or chocolate, and nothing exploded with the flick of the lightswitch. A quick glance around showed everything the way I'd left it late last night. A flicker of disappointment shot through me. Then I saw it, leaning casually against the threadbare sofa, the picture of perfection with the word Courtenay undulating beautifully up its side. \"Oh, my God,\" I breathed, \"it's beautiful.\" It was a guitar, and it looked like an expensive one, too. \"It was Carl's idea,\" he said modestly. \"He came to me and said he'd thought of something for your birthday but he couldn't afford it on his own. So we all chipped in. Chose the model together and picked out the letters to stick on before they shipped it over.\" I was almost speechless. They'd never done anything more than a cake and a packet of cigarettes for my birthday before. Now here was this guitar with almost tasteful vinyl letters spelling my name across it. \"Thank you,\" I said, turning to face them all. Dad had turned up, too, and was leaning against the doorframe. I threw myself onto Carl and hugged him. \"It's the best present ever.\" After everyone had been hugged and wished me a happy birthday in turn, the Count gestured towards it expectantly. \"Are you going to play it?\" I picked it up reverently and sat down on the sofa. I plucked out the first line of Happy Birthday. \"I don't have any music,\" I mused, experimenting with a chord progression, trying out the sound. It was better quality than the one I borrowed off Tim the possessive jerk. \"Ah, well, that's where I come in,\" Dad said happily, stepping forwards. \"I went through your record collection – sorry – and then found the music for the songs you play most often.\" He tossed a wrapped package carelessly onto the sofa next to me. I opened it; sheet music for Bread, the Beatles, Cat Stevens, the Kinks, the Monkees, the Beach Boys… all of my favourite songs spilled out across the old brown couch. I picked up If You Want to Sing Out and struck up a C chord. It was one of the best birthdays I'd ever had; certainly the best I could have hoped for. Later that afternoon I sat in the cabin playing Truth or Dare with the rest of the DJs when Dad cleared his throat ostentatiously. He stood on the stairs with John at his side. John looked anxious and was holding an ominous-looking chart. \"Courtenay, I have one more surprise for you before the day is out, but I'm afraid it's preceded by some not-so-nice news.\" I looked up from where Mark was unbuttoning his shirt (Dave had just dared him to remove it) to look Dad in the eyes as he spoke about advertising. \"This chart,\" John held it up, realised it was upside-down, and turned it right-way-up, \"thank you, John – shows what's happened to our advertising revenue in the last few weeks.\" I winced. The chart showed a steep decline down to almost nothing. Someone behind me said 'ouch' and I heard a few sharp intakes of breath. \"So, I've had to stir myself from my traditional… languor,: I flashed him a grin, \"and do something to make the station more attractive to new commercial partners. \"Two years ago, something terrible happened, and we lost the greatest DJ Pirate Radio has ever known to America, ambition, and alcoholic poisoning.\" Dave and Simon made gestures of heartbreak and respect. I shared a glance with Carl. He had to mean Gavin. \"And then something wonderful happened and we got, in return, from America, a man who proved more than capable of filling those enormous shoes.\" I grinned at the Count; he raised a hand to wave this away. \"I do my humble best.\" \"And now, my friends, I have good news.\" I found myself leaning forwards in my seat as Dad shot me a smile. \"Very good news.\" I took Carl's hand in mine and squeezed it; he squeezed mine back as the same thought crossed both our minds. \"Gavin Kavanagh,\" he said, and I felt Carl shift in his seat beside me, \"has decided,\" he was dragging this out, prolonging my pain, but it could really be only one thing he was going to say next: \"to return.\" I let out a squeal; it was happening! It was actually happening, just when I'd written it off for good. \"Three weeks today,\" Dad continued as the boat went into a state of general uproar, \"and Gavin Kavanagh returns to rock on Radio Rock.\" I was so caught up in celebrating as Harold picked me up and piggybacked me round the cabin that I didn't notice the Count, still sitting in his armchair looking thoroughly put out. Dad bent to leave the room, then stopped and turned back to me. \"Just promise me you won't sleep with him,\" he said softly. Three weeks flew by quicker than the blink of an eye; I'd offered to move in with Felicity and give Gavin his old room back, so in between moving all my stuff, broadcasting and playing my guitar, I'd had plenty to do. I was just stacking the last of my record collection off Gavin's shelves when Angus popped his ginger head in the doorway. \"Courtenay,\" he said excitedly, \"he's here!\" I almost dropped the Beegees record I was holding. He was finally here, my hero, the one and only Gavin. I picked up the stack. \"Thanks, Angus, I'll be there in a minute,\" I replied, and followed him out of the room. We stood there in single file all the way along the deck as if we were a line of soldiers waiting to stop an intruder, not welcome one of our own. I was buzzing; I tried not to grab Carl's hand again. I didn't want him to get the wrong idea. I grabbed Felicity's instead. To the sound of Jumping Jack Flash from the radio, the tip of a hawks-feather protruded over the deckrail, followed by the biggest hat I'd ever seen, and then finally, a blonde, weather-beaten head with a sharp nose and an arrogant pout. Eventually, a sharp purple suit-jacket made it into my line of sight and Gavin Kavanagh stepped onto the deck of Radio Rock , kissing two fingertips and waving at the cheering crowd. He wasn't exactly what I'd expected. I mean, you couldn't listen to his broadcasts and not expect him to be a little bit arrogant, but this was excessive. He had the air of a man who not only expects adulation, but demands it like a petulant child on the rare occasion it wasn't given automatically. I clapped and cheered him anyway, letting go of Felicity's hand, as he shook hands with Dad, hugged Harold, fondled Bob's beard, kissed Dave and was jumped on from behind by Simon. Then he reached the part of the line where the Count stood, slightly behind everyone else, dragging innocuously on his cigarette. \"And you must be the Count,\" he said expectantly. The Count stepped forwards as if stepping up to a starting line in a race. \"I am he.\" A twitch of a smile crossed Gavin's admittedly quite attractive face. \"I wonder what that makes me, the King?\" I glanced at Carl; he had the same look on his face as I must have had. Definitely not what we expected. He came to stand in front of Felicity and I, hands on his hips. \"Rules have changed, then?\" he asked, throwing the question over his shoulder at Quentin, who gave me a stern look. I gave it right back; I honestly had no intention of sleeping with Gavin now. Well, only a little bit. \"Oh, no, I'm a lesbian,\" Felicity supplied. That half-smile again. \"Always, or… mostly?\" Felicity's smile became fixed and awkward. \"Absolutely always.\" I saw his hand travel down behind her. \"So you say,\" he whispered. She avoided the obvious butt-squeeze, now looking at me like it was my fault. Then he turned to me. \"And you're lesbian too?\" I cringed. \"Uh, no, but I'm Quentin's daughter, so I'm equally off-limits.\" He raised an eyebrow. \"Quentin's daughter?\" he looked back at Dad, who gave him a touch-her-and-you-die look. \"So you're Courtenay.\" I beamed inwardly that he knew who I was; did that mean he'd listened to my show? \"You prefer hard rock or soft?\" \"She's a softie,\" Dave called back. He took a step closer to me and I tried not to step away; I wanted Gavin, too, to accept me without Dad's help. \"Don't worry,\" he said in the same sensual, husky whisper he used on Felicity, \"I can be hard enough for both of us.\" I grimaced. \"Thanks, Gavin,\" I said, unable to keep the sarcasm at bay. \"That's comforting.\" He grinned. \"Now, take me to my microphone,\" he said, raising his voice theatrically, \"I need to broadcast.\" We filed inside after him. Dad put a hand on my shoulder. \"Remember your promise,\" he said. I gave him my best sarcastic glare. \"Okay,\" he admitted. \"I agree. But women seem to like it.\" I thought about this. \"They don't have to live with him,\" I said finally. \"They can just shag him and not worry about tomorrow.\" Dad nodded. \"Fair enough.\" Carl walked past us, an odd smile on his angular face. 'I've just remembered something,\" he said happily. \"It's my birthday in two weeks.\"[Chapter 5] Carl's birthday started to loom over me. After the guitar, the increasingly urgent problem of what to get him for his birthday became all-consuming. Finally I went to see Dad. \"Do you think I could invite a friend onto the boat for Carl's birthday?\" He nodded thoughtfully. I flicked through all my girlfriends in my head. Not many of them would be Carl's type, and the ones that were were far too shy to go on a blind date with the kinds of people they knew lived on the boat with me. I didn't want someone who'd just sleep with him and then blow him off. Dave had tried that. I looked at Dad forlornly. \"I don't actually know anyone who'd do something like this that Carl wouldn't freak out at the sight of.\" Dad, thinking of the one friend of mine he'd met, Josie, who was completely insane and went around grabbing Felicity's breasts and jumping on everyone else, including him, snorted. \"Well then, I believe we have a problem,\" he said unhelpfully. \"No shit,\" I replied sarcastically. I thought for a while, then my befuddled brain dredged up a long-dead memory. \"Don't I have a cousin on your side?\" I asked, frowning. \"I vaguely remember a failed tea-party where Mum attacked your sister.\" Dad laughed. \"I vaguely remember being told about that, too,\" he said reminiscently. \"Yes, Lou does have a daughter. Marianne. She'd about his age, too…\" \"Can you write to her? Do you think she'll do it?\" I asked eagerly. He smiled his odd smile. \"I'm sure she will. I'll write tonight.\" The lone memory I had of Marianne was an attempt from my mother to try and let me get to know Dad's side of the family. She had written to Dad's sister Louise and arranged to get us together for tea. The only thing I remember was eight-year-old Marianne's face as the conversation turned ugly, like it usually did when Mum started talking about Dad, and she bodily tackled my aunt Louise across the table. She'd grown up a lot since then, I thought, looking at her across the table in Dad's cabin over red wine and Felicity's pasta, and was now quite pretty. I'd asked her where she bought the dress as soon as she was within earshot, spattered as it was with anchors and set off with her sea-green tights. Carl, to my delight, was obviously smitten, and she seemed quite taken with him as well. I sat there, eating my pasta, feeling quite pleased with myself, sharing the odd smug glance with Dad over the table. After the tea-party incident had been related as fully as possible and all our pasta plates had been scraped clean, Dad and I excused ourselves and shut the door carefully behind us. \"Good idea,\" Dad said quietly. \"I think it's working,\" I whispered in reply. I glanced through the porthole-shaped window. Marianne was laughing, her fingers flirting with the stem of her wineglass. It looked good. Later that night I sat in the downstairs cabin teaching myself the middle eight to Michelle by the Beatles on the guitar when Gavin came in loudly. I glanced up at him, then rolled my eyes and pretended I didn't notice, but started playing the song again from the beginning in the hope he'd hear how good I was getting. To my delight, he came and sat down next to me; however, this had a negative effect on my fingerpicking. On my third fumbled note, I stilled the strings and looked up at him irritatedly. \"What?\" He grinned, nonchalant. \"How long have you been playing?\" \"I got the guitar for my birthday about six weeks ago, but I played for a year before I came here.\" He raised an eyebrow. \"So on and off for about three years now. Do you play?\" He shook his head. \"My job is to play records, not instruments,\" he said, a wry grin playing with his mouth. He had a really interesting voice, drizzled in husk until every word sounded as though it were whispered between sweaty bedsheets. \"So's mine, but I play both anyway,\" I replied lightly. He chuckled. \"Unless you've got anything worth saying to me, please go away so I can practise,\" I said offhandedly. He looked at me for another few seconds as though trying to change my mind, then stood up and headed for the door. \"Your little friend Carl's doing well, in case you were interested,\" he said innocently. \"He just came by asking for a condom.\" I couldn't help grinning. \"Brilliant. Thanks, Gavin.\" He grinned back, though his grin was dripping sleaze. \"Anytime you need a condom – or someone to use it with.\" \"Thanks, but I'm sure I can find someone on my own.\" He shut the door. I launched into I Love My Dog , but I was only the second chorus when the door opened again. It was Carl. I felt a sly smirk creep onto my face. \"Hey, Carl. Where's Marianne?\" He flopped down on the other sofa opposite me. \"Gone.\" I couldn't resist changing my D chord smoothly into an A chord and slowing the strum. He recognised the song and tried a glare, but then gave up and hunched into himself, looking tiny and insecure. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"We were kissing. Stuff happened and I went to borrow a condom from Gavin, and when I came back she was in bed with Dave.\" He said it quickly, as though this might make the blow less severe. I flinched. Harsh. I tried to think of something comforting to say, but came up dry. \" Come over to the window, my little darling, I'd like to try to read your palm,\" I sang instead. He looked as if he might cry and I made as if to stop, but he gestured that I could go on. \" I used to think I was some kind of gypsy boy Before I let you take me home…\" I changed my chord progression slightly and Harold and John came in; Harold was carrying a cup of tea, John a plate of chocolate biscuits. \" Now so long, Marianne, It's time we began To laugh… and cry… and cry… And laugh about it all again.\" They put down the cup and plate and pushed them towards Carl. He just looked at them, so I took a biscuit and ate it myself. \" Your letters, they all say that you're beside me now Then why do I feel alone? I'm standing on a ledge And you're finding spiderweb Is fastening my ankle to a stone…\" Harold followed my lead and took a biscuit; with a tentative look at Carl, still gazing straight-ahead, he dipped it in the tea before eating it. \" Now so long, Marianne, It's time we began To laugh… and cry… and cry… And laugh about it all again.\" Before too much of Carl's unresponsiveness, there was one biscuit left and the teacup was only half-full. I had a smile on my face as I kept softly keening the song, but Carl still didn't respond. \" For now, I need your hidden love I'm cold as a new razor blade You left when I told you I was curious I never said that I was brave…\" Finally, Carl jerked out of his trance and snatched the last biscuit. Harold grinned and offered him the teacup; a wry smile on his face, he dipped the chocolate in the tea. \" Now so long, Marianne, It's time we began To laugh… and cry… and cry… And laugh about it all again.\" \"Don't worry, Carl,\" I comforted as I flourished the last chord and stilled my guitar-strings. \"There are other girls.\" I think I always knew I was wrong, but he didn't seem to. \"Thanks, Court.\" Overcome by happiness in his childish manner, Harold hugged Carl and spilt the still-hot tea all over his trousers. Carl's photography was amazing. It always surprised me when I walked into his room to see my own face staring back at me several times over, along with almost everyone else on the boat: Gavin, posed with his outstretched tongue inches from the microphone; Mark, sunbathing in his tight leather pants; Simon pulling a childish face; the Count flipping the bird and turning his face away. I'd never considered myself photogenic, but Carl's photos seemed to show me in a new light, somehow still pretty mid-laugh, mid-exhale with cigarette smoke writhing snakelike around my face. Even John with his odd, square face still managed to look poetic, eerie and haunting somehow until the pictures were almost beautiful. It gave me chills. \"Hey, Court,\" Carl said, coming into the cabin behind me. \"You're so talented,\" I told him pettishly. \"I'm so jealous.\" He smiled incredulously, but to my satisfaction he didn't reject the compliment. Last time I complimented him – his handsome face, his skinny but still muscular body, his photography, his innocence – he'd denied it. I can't stand false modesty. \"You're talented too,\" he said, sitting down on his bed. I snorted. I'd tried to take pictures with his camera, but they'd failed quite spectacularly. \"No, seriously! Admittedly, not a photography, but your guitar-playing is getting to be amazing.\" I grinned. \"Thanks, but I'm no Jimi Hendrix.\" I sat down beside him. \"I tried one of his riffs the other day, but I fucked it up pretty bad.\" He laughed. Kevin came in with that odd look on his face when he thinks he's being quite clever. \"Hey Carl, Courtenay,\" he said quickly. \"Congratulations, you've remembered our names,\" I said drily. Sometimes I had no patience for Kevin. \"What's one plus one equal?\" he asked proudly, not registering my sarcasm. \"Oh, and basic arithmetic, too, we are passing in leaps and bounds.\" Carl laughed at me, but in a way that made me feel bad for being so scathing to poor Kevin. He couldn't really help it, after all, and sometimes he could be really quite endearing. \"One plus one, um, that would be… two?\" \"No!\" said Kevin ecstatically. \"No?\" Kevin shook his head with the demented glee of a two-year-old. \"It's 'window', see?\" I laughed at the ancient joke and produced a piece of paper for him to demonstrate. \"You see? Because one…\" he drew a line on the paper, \"plus… one… equals… Window!\" \"Very nice, Kev. Who showed you that?\" \"The Count.\" \"I'll be having words with him.\" I was about to explain how one plus one may make a window when you write them down, but that didn't mean it equalled 'window', when Simon came in behind us. \"Hey, guys,\" he said, in a voice at least an octave higher than the one he usually used. I looked around in surprise; Simon was bursting with so much excitement he was actually singing. \"Carl,\" he sang in a key even I couldn't reach, \"my mate,\" here he grabbed Carl by the neck in an over-affectionate gesture, \"my best mate… I have some news…\" I coughed slightly and he seemed to recall a mite of decorum. \"I don't know why I'm singing,\" he apologised. \"I just… I can't… my words are just coming out in tune, I'm so happy.\" I started to get worried; Simon was swaying his pelvis in a motion that was starting to make me seasick. He looked thoroughly deranged. \"If I were the Count right now,\" he continued, his voice rising again, \"I would definitely be using the 'f' word to describe the level of this good news…\" his voice went far too high and he struggled to keep himself under control. \"Oh… come hold me…\" he pulled Carl into a clumsy hug. \"Spit it out, then, Simon,\" I said finally, my ears still ringing from his last 'news'. \"I'm getting married! To a woman!\" It was like a slap in the face, only pleasant. Simon? Married? \"Wow,\" I said, hugging him. \"Congrats!\" He squeezed me so tight I couldn't breathe and then bounced off up the corridor. \"I'm going to tell the others!\" It was the first time I'd ever hated being a girl on the boat, when I stood there in the recording studio with Harold and the Count as they went over the plan for Simon's stag night. I knew what they had in mind, and it sounded like the kind of fun I hadn't had in ages, spending far too much time bar-hopping and getting absolutely smashed. Harold, even though he wasn't going, seemed almost more excited than the Count. \"I have the tapes,\" he said, pointing to them, \"and I'll play them in for each of your shows.\" The Count winked at me. \"And then we'll return at the cracking crack of dawn, when the real Simon will slip in seamlessly at precisely 5.59am.\" Harold nodded excitedly. \"Well, that's just groovy.\" \"You don't know how groovy!\" The Count exclaimed. Sure don't , I thought sullenly. \"We'll have the ultimate stag party, and Quentin will never know.\" I snorted. I didn't really think Dad would mind anything except his exclusion from the event. Then the Count darted ninja-style from the room, and Harold and I were alone. I didn't even think about the radio past then; it was playing in the background, obviously, as always, but I alternated between playing board games with Harold and baking with Felicity all night. It somehow felt wrong to sleep when I knew they were all out there having the time of their lives. I was with Felicity when something Bob said on the radio caught my attention. I sat up and listened harder. \"…and I'm handing over to the man of the hour, Simple Simon himself.\" It took me a second to react to the sudden silence on the radio. Then I looked at Felicity and saw on her face the same look that must have been on mine. \"Shit!\" And I ran. For the first time in my life, I agreed with Dave's wish that the kitchen and the recording studio were closer. I sprinted down the hallway, feeling like half of Britain was speeding under my feet, hearing nothing but the pounding of my own footsteps. It wasn't until I reached the door that I realised that the reason I wasn't hearing the radio was no longer because it was silent. Harold sat in the seat with his feet on the table, just like he'd seen Gavin doing numerous times. \"I'm afraid to tell you that my man Simon is not quite feeling up to his game,\" he said languidly, in a voice that rivalled Gavin's best radio persona and completely belied the skinny, awkward boy sitting in the DJ's chair. \"So I hope you're game for a roller-coaster ride that is,\" he flicked on a circus-style record I didn't recognise, \"Spike Seeeeeeeeeeeattle!\" He turned off his mike. I stepped into the room properly and he jumped, looking at me guiltily. \"Sorry, Courtenay,\" he said meekly. \"On the contrary,\" I told him, grinning. \"Thanks for saving our skins. In style, I might add.\" He smiled sheepishly, then started to get up. \"You can have the seat now,\" he said. \"Oh, no!\" He stopped. \"You can't give audiences a brilliant introduction to a new DJ, play them one song and then give them back boring old Courtenay! You have to finish what you've started!\" They found us like that three hours later, Harold still broadcasting in his lazy Spike Seattle voice, me still sitting in the tech box watching him with a helpless little smile on my face. They piled in, wondering who the fuck Spike Seattle was, and then looking like I had when I first saw Harold in the studio, as confident as if he owned the place. Harold, caught up in a stirring sign-off, ( \"Have a sweet, sweet day, and never forget that we live in a world where dreams can, and usually do, come true…\" ) didn't see them enter until he'd switched off his mike and turned to face me. Once again, he gave a guilty start and jumped off the chair. \"Morning, Harold,\" Angus said casually. \"Uh, morning, lads,\" Harold said, his arms going awkwardly to his lower back, his weight bouncing from foot to foot. \"Just keeping the seat warm,\" he explained hurriedly. \"Hope I haven't let you down.\" \"You have not,\" Angus said authoritatively. \"In fact, you've made us proud.\" He shook Harold's hand. I stood up and started a round of applause, which the others continued eagerly. Simon hugged him and then made bowing gestures as though worshipping him. Harold, his dark cheeks flushed, his skinny chest swollen with their praise, stepped into the tech box with a triumphant wiggle. \"I am the King!\" he exclaimed happily, and I found myself laughing at how childishly cute he was. \"Sure are.\" I hugged him and gave him his usual seat back; he continued to pace awkwardly, touching a few things in the box to make sure they hadn't been moved in his absence. He adjusted an imaginary crown on his head. \"King Harold,\" he said, now slightly awkward in his self-delight. About an hour later, I decided it was time to take Simon to bed. I found Carl, dragging absently on the last of his cigarette in the hallway, looking engaged in thought and thoroughly out of it. Simon was extremely overexcited and kept jumping on people, knocking poor John completely to the ground. \"Help,\" I commanded Carl, and then jumped on Simon, which seemed to subdue him. \"So how'd it go?\" I asked Carl as we led Simon back to his cabin. \"Kevin dropped a bombshell,\" he replied, obviously not focussing on the here and now. \"Oh?\" \"Yeah.\" Simon stumbled and we both lunged to catch him. \"He thinks… and I actually accept his reasoning for this one…\" he trailed off as we managed to dump the inebriate on the bed, then he turned to me, his face dead serious. \"He thinks Quentin's my dad.\"[Chapter 6] Sorry it's been a while, I've had exams and stuff. And general laziness. Thank you to all who have reviewed, it really does mean a lot. -for you! I blinked. \"Quentin? As in my dad?\" \"Yeah. And it actually made sense.\" Carl looked at me as though expecting me to yell at him. There was a kind of sinking feeling in my stomach, but I could see the pluses in having Carl as a half-brother. \"The effect of alcohol on Thick Kevin's brain. Hey, Carl, this is great! We can be brother and sister!\" He smiled hollowly. \"I just think someone should have told me. It seems… I dunno. I've always wanted a father, especially since I came here and saw the way yours treats you.\" \"He's yours now, too,\" I said cheerfully. \"And he likes you. Are you going to tell him?\" He hesitated. \"I dunno. I mean, how am I supposed to do it? And what if I'm wrong?\" He looked on the verge of tears. I put my arm around his shoulder in a clumsy hug. \"I think you should ask your mum. She'd know better than Dad. A letter could be kind of awkward though… I don't know. Think about it later. I'll help.\" I grinned. Right on cue, as though stepping in to distract him, Simon leaned forwards and vomited on his feet. I grimaced. \"Come on, Carl. Get some rest. We have a wedding to attend this afternoon, and we can't have a puffy, half-conscious best man.\" I neglected to mention the state of the groom, now apologizing heartily to Carl and trying to wipe the vomit from his shoes. Carl looked down at him and snorted. \"Could be an interesting day.\" The wedding passed without much incident. Elenore was beautiful; much more so than I could ever have imagined. As Dad said during his rather impromptu ceremony, God knew why she was marrying him. It was a beautiful ceremony, too – Simon's amazing patchwork coat made all the difference – but for some reason it made me feel ill. I noticed once or twice that Carl was looking up at Dad with an odd kind of yearning on his face and I felt almost guilty for the secret hope I had inside myself that Kevin in all his wisdom had made a mistake. I didn't want to share my father. I loved him too much, just the way he was. I sat inside the kitchen on the floor while Felicity was outside somewhere. Carl came in and sat down next to me. \"That was nice,\" he said as if trying to probe something out of me. I leaned my head on his shoulder and closed my eyes. It was nice. But I'd hated it. \"Could be us someday,\" he commented casually. I sat up and looked at him. \" What? \" Second bombshell of the day. If he dropped another one, I might explode from shock. He realized what he'd said and suddenly looked terrified. \"Oh God! No – I didn't mean – I meant we'll get married to other people one day. Not each other!\" I laughed. \"Okay, sure.\" I sighed. \"Well, you might.\" I got up and started rooting through the fridge; I found some celery and, with a tentative look around for Felicity, cut off a stick. \"You don't think you'll ever get married?\" he asked. \"What's with the celery?\" \"It's Felicity's. She's a little bit possessive.\" \"Possessive? Felicity?\" \"Stranger things have happened.\" I sat back down. \"No, I don't see myself marrying.\" He stood up as if to get himself some celery; I snapped mine in half. \"Here, have this,\" I told him quickly. \"She notices if you take more than one.\" He chuckled and took it. \"You don't 'dig the dream', then?\" he asked, slumping back down beside me. \"No, I 'dig the dream',\" I quoted, munching loudly. \"It's a good dream. But… what if that's all it is? I mean…\" I trailed off and waved my celery vaguely. \"How do you know they're the one?\" \"Don't they say you just know?\" \"But what if you're wrong?\" I looked over at him, sad again. \"I just don't think I could commit to something like that for the rest of my life, just going by instinct.\" He was nodding. \"I see where you're coming from. But… look at Simon and Elenore! They've only known each other for two weeks, and they know.\" \"Maybe they'll be lucky.\" I was watching the door with half an eye; now Felicity entered in her usual meek manner. I hurriedly shoved the last of my celery in my cheeks like a chipmunk. Carl, after a quick glance at me, did the same. Felicity turned around to see both of us munching heartily. \"What are you two eating?\" she asked, slightly suspiciously. \"Bread.\" She gave me a hard look. \"Crunchy bread,\" she commented lightly, and turned away. \"Toast,\" Carl put in innocently, but a piece of half-chewed celery spat out of his mouth and landed on the tiled floor. \"Celery,\" she corrected. \"All right,\" Felicity started to swell alarmingly like some colourful Ratched; Carl and I cringed. Dave walked in. Felicity seemed to calm down. \"So what's happening in here?\" he asked. \"These two are eating my celery,\" she said. Dave made a noise of disgust. \"Yeah,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Courtenay's got a thing about taking what doesn't belong to her.\" I looked up, shocked but with a sneaky feeling I knew what he was talking about. \"I've got a what? \" \"You know what I mean, Court. I'm missing ten pounds.\" \"That's a shame,\" I quipped, suppressing a smirk. \"But it sounds as though you're insinuating I stole your ten pounds.\" \"You did,\" he accused, quite correctly, as it happened. \"You stole it and gave it to Carl for that egg thing.\" Good with his facts, this boy. \"I paid Carl for that out of my own pocket, didn't I, Carl?\" He nodded solemnly. He couldn't deny it; he'd even seen me remove the tenner from my pocket. \"You see? I didn't take your ten quid. If you have to suspect someone because of the egg thing it should be Carl – no offence,\" I added quickly to the boy. \"I wouldn't profit at all from the removal of your money. And Carl has more reasons to want revenge from you than the eggs,\" I reminded. Cheap shot, maybe, but he needed to be reminded that I wasn't the only thief on the boat, or by any means the worst. \"I know it was you,\" he insisted, \"and if you don't admit it then Doctor Dave is going to write you a prescription for a self-kicking arse!\" He made threatening kung-fu gestures. I snorted. \"Only because you can't come over here and kick my arse yourself,\" I rebounded in an oh-no-you-didn't-eliciting tone. I heard a collective snigger and looked around to find that everyone on the boat except for Simon, Elenore and Mark were now in the room and laughing at the extremely angry expression on Dave's face. They all knew I was lying. Even Dave knew it. \"Come on, Court. It wasn't Carl. No-one else had a reason to take it. You stole it, just admit it.\" I sighed defeatedly. \"Dave, when I broke that egg I wasn't thinking clearly enough to plan, oh, I'll say I'll pay and then go steal a tenner out of Dave's underwear drawer.\" Dave pounced. \"I never said it was stolen from my underwear drawer,\" he said triumphantly. I could have bluffed my way out of it, but I decided to go for comic. I grinned guiltily. \"Oops.\" The others laughed. \"I want that ten quid back, you know,\" he said in a hurt voice. I shrugged. \"I stole your tenner, you stole my best friend's girlfriend, we're square.\" I woke up earlier than normal the following morning; early enough to be fiddling with my guitar by the kitchen when Carl came in for a cup of tea. \"Morning.\" He jumped. The sofa I was sitting on was hidden from him by a low bench. \"Oh my God – where are you?\" I stood up. \"I couldn't see you there. You're up earlier than usual.\" With a guilty glance at the clock – it was nine thirty – I waved him away. \"I was hoping to see Simon.\" Carl's face fell. \"Oh.\" \"What?\" \"Well – I saw him earlier.\" He looked awkward. My heart sprinted down to my abdomen. \"He said it… well, it could have gone better. I'm not saying they're not still happy, don't look like that,\" he said quickly to my crestfallen expression. \"It just wasn't the amazing night he'd expected.\" I relaxed slightly. Then Simon came in, and my heart dropped back to my thighs and took my stomach with it. He was deathly pale and looked like he was about to go into shock. \"Simon?\" He didn't respond. \"Simon, what's happened?\" I asked, putting down the guitar and scrambling around the bench to stand in front of him. After about five minutes' struggle, he managed one word. \"Elenore.\" \"Oh, Lord.\" I grabbed his hand as he swayed precariously. \"Sit down, come on…\" the two of us led him to my recently-vacated sofa and sat him down. \"Elenore what?\" After another huge struggle, he repeated, \"Elenore…\" and stopped again. Then he told us. I almost said, 'you're kidding', but then I stopped myself. Simon was too sweet for insensitive comments like that. \"Oh, Simon,\" Carl sighed, giving the DJ a rough man-hug, \"I'm so sorry.\" 'Sorry' didn't really do it for me. I finally understood the term 'blind rage'. I stood up unsteadily and Simon looked up at me. \"What are you doing?\" \"I'm going to stab Gavin with a Stanley knife and pitch his body into the North Sea,\" I affirmed, as calmly as I could. Carl stood up. \"Me too.\" \"You're too young,\" I dismissed, and left. I tried not to run, but it was no good; I was so angry I wanted Gavin's enormous head under my fingertips now , and without fully knowing it I was sprinting up the steps. I was fuming so hard that I actually thought I might murder him, before I slammed into his door without bothering with the handle, leaving it to fly wildly between me and the wall. What I saw inside the room left me temporarily speechless. Elenore straddled Gavin in her turquoise negligée, her panties discarded on the floor. They stopped in shock as I came in, not even attempting to hide what they'd been doing. \"Out! \" I shouted at her. She blinked huge eyes at me. \"What?\" \"OUT! GET OUT! \" She yelped and darted out of the room. Gavin scrambled for a blanket to cover his cock; I approached him, my fists clenched so hard I was almost drawing blood, hardly noticing that I was looking at Gavin Kavanagh stark-bollock naked. \"How…\" I yelled incoherently a few times. \"How could you!\" \"What?\" He tried gingerly, now pulling his dark jeans back on. \"WHAT?\" I screamed, \" WHAT? That was your friend's wife! Of – what's it been – twelve hours? Thirteen? He loved you! Both of you! And… and you…\" I couldn't even get it out, what he'd done. Words couldn't describe it. Simon, sweet, naïve Simon, betrayed in the only thing he'd ever thought he'd finally got lucky in, by the great Gavin. Great, my arse. \"Oh, come on,\" he defended. \"It wasn't my fault.\" I screamed, trying and failing to hold onto my last shred of outward control, and flew at him, punching and kicking every inch of him I could reach, mad with the injustice of it, until I felt Dad's hands on me, pulling me away from him, and soon I was wrapped in Dave's meaty arms, still trying to hit the man who'd destroyed my only proof that love did exist. A /N: Once again, sorry for the delay. Exams are over now so I'd say updates will speed up but I'm working full time and I've discovered Black Books, so they might not. Bear with me. At least I have actually written the next few chapters already. We are now getting into the climax of the story, sadly, but that means it will become less plot from the actual film and from now on almost completely either mine or from the deleted scene \"Radio Sunshine\". I'll keep typing now, I'm sure you'd rather I typed more story than more author's note. Can I urge you once again to review, it really does make my day. -for you![Chapter 7] Ahaa! Update number two for today! It was three days before they let Gavin into my line of sight again. Carl and Simon had been my constant companions, Carl disapproving of my fit but slightly impressed, too, and Simon just grateful I cared. I tried really hard to explain what I did; to Dad, to Carl, to myself. Simon was my best friend before Carl came along, and he was such a sweet soul, it was hard to imagine him doing anyone any wrong. I was already so upset that Gavin wasn't the amazing guy I'd dreamt of that the final bastardly act had tipped me over the edge and it wasn't just my reaction to that one thing coming out but three months of resentment at the way he acted, the way he treated me and even Felicity as scraps of meat, as if it was only a matter of time before we turned in his favour and fell madly in love with him. And then there was the fact that I really, really wanted to believe in love. I almost had, four days ago when I was sitting on the deck of the boat playing the Turtles' Elenore to the happy couple. Then Gavin-fucking-Kavanagh shattered his second one of my dreams in the few short months he'd been on board. I'd heard about the Count's adverse reaction to the news. I was surprised at first, but then I thought that he, too, was reacting to a build-up of resentment at being second-best to Gavin. Carl told me he'd declared war – with a capital W-A-R – but the next I'd heard of it came, surprisingly, from the Count's own lips. I was in the cabin I shared with Felicity, sulking, when he came in. \"Hey, Court.\" I looked up. \"Hey.\" \"Um… Quentin says you can come watch Gavin and I play chicken.\" I grinned at him. \"Thanks.\" We walked up toward the main deck in the most civil silence we'd ever shared. \"It seems we are united against a common enemy,\" I commented finally. \"I assure you it's only temporary,\" he warned, but I could tell he was joking. I sighed. \"The world today,\" I mused. \"Next thing you know, we won't be the biggest fish in the sea anymore.\" We both laughed; ironic, really. We weren't to know. \"So how did you end up here?\" We were sitting on the floor in the boiler room, me playing a lively blues rhythm on my guitar while Carl listened and talked to me. The Count was smoking peacefully at the bar; Mark & Dave were playing fooseball. Gavin was sitting in a chair like a fat, satisfied toad and Simon, Angus and John were chatting idly in a corner. The others, too, were scattered around the room. It was a Friday evening and we were all lazy and contented. \"Mum kicked me out of the house. I think she thought it was a big hit, a cut below the belt. I don't think she ever thought I'd actually go.\" \"No, mine either,\" he chuckled. \"Was she okay with it, though? She sounds like a bit of a control freak, your mum.\" \"Yep. Sometimes I wonder why Dad shagged her. They're so different.\" Carl frowned at the sentiment. \"So what did she say whe you told her you were actually moving out?\" I grinned, changing my hold on the guitar. \"Oh, you know…\" I pulled a G-C strum and a couple of arpeggio notes. It's not time to make a change, Just relax, take it easy, You're still young, that's your fault, There's so much you have to know…\" Carl laughed. \"Find a girl, settle down, If you want, you can marry, Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy,\" he joined in sagely. We set ourselves up for the epic song, both grinning like idiots. \" I was once like you are now And I know that it's not easy To be calm when you've found something going on But take your time, think a lot Think of everything you've got For you will still be here tomorrow But your dreams may not…\" I changed key, and was about to break out into the 'son' part when Dad's whistle blew. A collective groan went up. \"All right,\" Dad said loudly, claiming everyone's attention, \"I have some rather… strange news.\" I exchanged a glance with Carl as Dad said, \"Our listening numbers –\" There was a cheer. \"Let's hear it,\" Dave said enthusiastically. \"Ah, have gone down,\" Dad finished. Shock horror. \"What?\" The Count shifted in his seat. \"Not mine,\" he said complacently. \"Everyone's,\" Dad contradicted. \"Except, of course, Gavin's.\" Gavin, looking straight at me, did his signature two fingers to his lips. I stuck out my tongue childishly. \"And,\" Dad continued, \"Simon's Super Sunday Smash Show.\" I gave a little cheer. \"But that's just because Radio Sunshine ,\" he made a face, \"doesn't have a chart show.\" I opened my mouth, but the Count beat me to it. \"Radio what-the-fuck?\" Gavin sighed. \"Doesn't it get depressing when the 'f' word has to be in every single sentence?\" he said to Carl, who ignored him. \"Right here,\" the Count reminded him. He pretended to jump in fright. \"Oh, fuck, sorry.\" There were a couple of titters from the others. \"Fuck off, Gavin,\" I said loudly. Harold laughed. Dad cleared his throat. \"Anyway. Ten days ago, a new station opened up in the North Sea. It is called,\" he grimaced, \"Radio Sunshine, and it broadcasts eighteen hours a day.\" He paused while we all took this in. \"Oh, and by the way,\" he added, a final blow designed to leave us prone on the floor. \"Radio Sunshine's motto is who needs the Beatles when you've got Herman's Hermits?\" I looked at the Count; he was looking like all his worst nightmares had come true. I grinned. This could be interesting. We were making our way down to the Count's cabin later that night when Gavin fell into step beside us. I ignored him for at least a minute before he sighed. \"Oh, come on, Courtenay,\" he said, using my name for the first time since I'd met him, \"I didn't hurt you .\" I stopped walking and looked at him. \"Simon's my best friend. It hurt me that you could hurt him like that. How could you even think that that was a good idea?\" \"I didn't,\" he replied easily. \"I told her it wasn't on, that she shouldn't do it. I didn't ask for this to happen; in fact, I asked for it not to, and I don't see why I'm being blamed for it.\" \"I walked in on the two of you in bed, that doesn't seem like blameless to me!\" I rebutted, my voice rising again. \"Well, I…\" he paused, then flapped his hands idly. \"You're going to blame me whatever I say.\" He learned fast. I shrugged. \"Because you're not saying anything that's going to change my mind. And besides…\" I sighed and started walking again. \"It's not just that. I don't like you because you're not what I expected you to be.\" He chuckled. \"What did you expect?\" \"I dunno. I thought you'd be… like the others, only sexy. Like you'd treat me like they all do.\" He pouted. \"But admit it,\" he said in a low, throaty voice. \"You weren't wrong about the sexy part.\" I slapped him, and Carl and I walked faster to leave him behind, Carl chortling idly, Gavin looking thoroughly un-sexy. We gathered in the Count's cabin under cover of darkness to find that the rest of them were there already. \"Right,\" I said as we arrived. \"Radio Sunshine.\" The Count nodded ominously. \"We used to have a motto in my college frathouse,\" he began. \"Don't get mad, get even.\" I nodded and took a bite of the carrot Simon was holding. He yelped and jerked it away from me. \" Our motto,\" he said, eyeing me warily, \"was –\" he spouted something that sounded like Spanish. \"And what did that mean?\" the Count asked, puzzled. \"I don't know. I wish I did.\" \"Right,\" Angus interjected. \"Our motto was never wear purple with beige. \" \"Oh – moving on!\" the Count recalled, obviously marvelling at how fast the conversation had slipped from his hands. \"Now, I believe in that old motto,\" he said in a business-like way. \"And I also believe that some of us have gone and forgotten who we are. Now what are we?\" \"We're pirates,\" I said calmly, accidentally spitting out a bit of carrot. That was undignified. \"Sorry.\" \"Exactly, we're pirates! And what do pirates do?\" \"Play records!\" Kevin yelled excitedly. The Count looked nonplussed. \"No, uh… actual pirates.\" Kevin hesitated. \"Play actual… records?\" \"No! Fuck me!\" the Count exclaimed, rubbing his face in odd ways. I supressed a bout of giggles. \"It's all right, I've got it,\" Dave said cockily, throwing out his chest to alarming effect. \"I think real pirates roam the high seas in search of loot and treasure.\" \"Yeah!\" the Count yelled rousingly, making Carl and I whoop and clap. \"In other words,\" he continued, still practically shouting. \"They kick the fucking shit out of anyone in the fucking ocean who gets in their fucking way.\" I whooped again. The Count grinned at me, taking advantage of his dramatic lead to give a gesture like a herald in a medieval battle. \"And what's Radio Sunshine doing?\" \"Playing records!\" Kevin burst out, mimicking the Count's triumphant tone. \"Fuck,\" the Count said, looking at Kevin like he'd never realised how thick he was. I collapsed laughing. Carl looked like he was trying not to join in. \"No,\" Simon corrected, \"it's getting in our…\" he broke off, hesitant as always to use the 'f' word. \"Flipping way.\" \"Yeah,\" the Count said in relief. \"So what are we going to do?\" \"We,\" Simon finished dramatically, \"are going to kick the flip out of it!\" \"Yeah! All right, let's go!\" the Count started, but I grabbed his coat and held him back. \"Tomorrow,\" I said. \"If we go tonight we won't have much time before dawn. We should prepare tomorrow and go tomorrow night.\" The Count, caught up in the heat of his anger at Herman's Hermits, hesitated. \"Okay. So what are we going to do tomorrow so Quentin doesn't notice?\" I smiled thoughtfully. \"Weren't you guys going to start an exercise regime?\" A/N: Don't expect another today. Sorry. I have also nearly finished the whole story! Muahaha! Review please! -for you.[Chapter 8] A/N: Ahahaha! Update #3 this week! 'm on a roll! Except I haven't quite finished the next one yet. Thank you to all my loyal reviewers! Oh, and ChilliPowder . Actually the only Gavin/Courtenay I was going to end up with was platonic, though I have of course been hinting at it I think it would be... I dunno... wrong for them to actually end up together. Courtenay/Count... I was going somewhere with both pairings, but it wasn't there. For either. I'm tying it all up in the epilogue. For now, enjoy the mischief and mayhem in this chapter! -for you! The next day dawned bright and cloudless, and the early morning saw all of us standing, facing the Count, in the boiler room. Felicity and I were dressed for exercise, in shorts and singlets and Angus was minus the singlet, but nobody else seemed to have made an effort; Carl was even still smoking. Gavin sat in his usual leather and sunglasses, lounging in an armchair directly behind me. \"If I fart, you're screwed,\" I told him. He chuckled again, but he seemed to have made it his duty to stay as close to me as possible now he knew how much and why I hated him, and I had to admit it was working; his antics that I once found sickening now made me struggle to hide a smile. \"Right,\" the Count began to get everyone's attention. \"Today we begin our new exercise regime. We have let ourselves go…\" he looked in the mirror next to him and patted his stomach ruefully. \"Especially me. But if we do this stuff every day, then in a month we'll all look like…\" he bent down, swore as his expansive belly got in the way, and picked up a poster. \"Steve McQeen! Now how fucking sexy is that?\" \"That's so sexy,\" Simon agreed. I, personally, didn't particularly want to look like Steve McQueen, but I understood the appeal. \"Right. Oh, God…\" the Count cursed again as he put the poster down. He paused for a second and looked at me uncertainly. I giggled and made press-up motions. \"Press ups!\" he said, and we all bent to the ground. More swearing came from the Count's direction. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Now when I say go, we'll… well, we'll start.\" Down in the press-up position, I suddenly felt a weight on my back as Gavin placed his Cuban heels in the small of my back like I was some sort of coffee table. \"Go,\" the Count said finally. I was a reasonably fit person, but with Gavin pushing down as hard as he could on my back until I was lifting at least twice my own weight, even I was struggling. \"Fuck off, Gavin!\" I said exasperatedly. \"Get our fucking feet off me!\" He just laughed as we struggled through the Count's excruciatingly slow count of 'One…' I tried a bucking motion with my back, but that just caused his heels to crash into my back harder. 'Two…' I bent and lifted again. \"That's perfect.\" I collapsed. \"That's it for today, guys.\" Gavin got up and waltzed nonchalantly from the room. The others started picking themselves up. \"Well done! I'll see you all same time tomorrow. I know this is going to be tough, but it's gunna be worth it.\" I chuckled. \"Seeing some improvement already, Dave,\" he congratulated, hugging the huge DJ. Carl loped over to me, looking exhausted. \"Two press-ups, Carl. Really?\" He grimaced. \"Hey, you look as bad as I am.\" \"I had Gavin-fucking-Kavanagh's feet on me until I was practically lifting him, too!\" I retaliated, looking the way he'd gone. \"One day, I will murder him.\" \"Yeah,\" Carl said easily, \"or marry him.\" Night fell too slowly, dark shreds of clouds strangling the sun's descent until we were all sitting in agony waiting for it. Finally the Count, dressed all in black with a balaclava stretched interestingly over his head, descended the stairs. \"Do we have our weapons?\" he asked. We held up the things we'd gathered; knives, glue, scissors, record labels, and a pre-recorded cassette tape. Simon held up a permanent-looking marker doubtfully. \"Are you sure this pen comes off, Kevin?\" \"Definitely.\" Simon shrugged and smeared it over his face. I laughed and turned it down. \"Right. Let's go.\" We all jumped up and rushed down the stairs, bubbling excitedly to each other. \"Shit!\" Dave whispered suddenly. \"Quentin! Quentin's coming!\" We swore and hurriedly backtracked, squeezing ourselves through the nearest door. As I tried to close it, it got stuck on Dave's stomach; I swore again and shoved as hard as I could. \"Come on, Dave, suck it in, man!\" the door clicked shut just in time; I heard Dad's heeled shoes tap past, holding my breath, though more out of lack of space than fear of discovery. \"Okay,\" I breathed finally. \"Coast's clear. Let's go.\" We all squeezed back out of the room and continued up the stairs. I fell back to wait for Carl. As he left the room, he turned back. \"Sorry, Felicity,\" he said. I turned to look inside the tiny room; Felicity sat on the loo, her hair rumpled. \"No, no,\" she said meekly. \"I enjoyed the company.\" We boarded the longboat and I grabbed an oar. I thought we'd be rowing for ages, but it had been barely ten minutes before the Count broke the relative silence. \"Oh my God,\" he whispered, \"there she is.\" He pointed a torch in the direction we were rowing. I glanced there to see a severely smaller boat than ours. It looked almost pathetic, sitting there all by itself. \"This,\" said Gavin in his usual husky whisper, \"is going to be so much fun!\" he said it with a little shiver on the 's' of 'so', so that it sounded like he'd just done something involuntary in his trousers. \"Orgasmic, isn't it, Gavin,\" I said sarcastically, but I felt it too. It was exciting to finally assume the name of 'pirate' we'd been given for so long. I could hardly sit still. They had a 'sentry' strutting around the boat; Dave threw a net over him and Gavin gave him a solid wallop over the head with an oar. Then we found the recording studio. The Count switched the lights on, pulled his balaclava down over his head and looked around. A cruel smile twitched over his face. \"Let the evilness begin.\" I cackled. Angus looked at me and nodded; he threw me a pot of glue and we headed towards the shelves of records. I pulled a handful from the shelf; Angus did the same beside me. I pulled from my pocket a handful of labels; Herman's Hermits, the latest songs from artists like the Beatles, the Move, the Monkees. Songs they were likely to play tomorrow. We gently peeled off the original stickers and glued on the new ones instead. Then, still cackling, I stacked them beside the record player in a neat playlist. I looked around. Dave extracted with difficulty the cassette from his pocket. I grabbed the advertisement tapes and glued them in their original positions. Dave tossed his one neatly beside them. Another look around showed all the DJs heavily involved in their mischief; Gavin was picking his nose beside me and wiping it on the microphone, the Count, Angus and Carl were sitting down with a pile of records and gouging deep scratches in them, Kevin was switching jingle tapes around in their stands with a look of intense concentration on his face. I noticed Simon standing in the middle of the room as though unsure what havoc to wreak next; I pulled a funnel out of my jacket pocket. \"Hey, Simon,\" I whispered. \"Here.\" He gazed at it blankly. \"What do I do with it? I shot him an evil grin and pointed at the teakettle. He returned it and headed off in that direction. Suddenly Gavin was behind me. \"You know what this boat needs?\" he whispered sensually in my ear. \"More of you? That'd be torture.\" He ignored me. \"A dead fish lying around somewhere.\" I thought about this. \"I think I saw some dead fish topside. I think this boat doubles as a trawler sometimes.\" We shared our first grin and dashed out of the door and up the stairs. Gavin tripped and fell up the stairs; I laughed and kept running, leaving him behind. He laughed and ran faster until he overtook me, slapping my arse as he went. I stopped. \"Gavin,\" I said seriously. He turned around, his grin fading. \"Not with the arse-touching, please.\" He kept walking backwards, twitching open a door as he went until we were on the main deck with the stars twinkling merrily above us. \"Sorry,\" he said, and he actually sounded it. \"I just think your arse is so sexy.\" I raised an eyebrow in disgust. \"Give it up, Gavin,\" I said easily. \"Even if I wanted to, I promised Dad I wouldn't sleep with you.\" He grinned again. \"He doesn't have to know.\" \" If I wanted to,\" I repeated pointedly. \"I don't. I hate the way you act like it's a foregone conclusion. It's such a turn-off, to say the least.\" He sighed. \"Sorry,\" he said again. He looked around briskly. \"So – fish?\" \"Over here, I think,\" I said, glad that his unnervingly sincere apologies were over. I showed him the huge crates I'd seen covered in black tarpaulin; he took hold of the first one and pulled. Fish. Brilliant. They were fat and glistening and already giving off that pungent fishy smell. I giggled. Gavin chuckled. I looked at him and he looked at me and the glee from the raid was still reflected in his eyes. He may be an arse, I thought suddenly, but he was a well-meaning arse. And we believed in the same things, and went about getting them in largely the same way. I didn't have to love him, but suddenly the idea that I'd have to live with him wasn't so bad. In the middle of our sappy little moment of non-verbal reconciliation, the door to the foredeck opened. \"What are you two doing out here?\" I jumped a mile in the air, thinking that someone from Radio Sunshine had caught us, before my still-sleepy brain processed the voice and realised it was Carl's. I calmed down. \"We were finding fish.\" It sounded really lame out loud, I realised. I proceeded to explain the method behind the madness to him. \"Oh,\" he said. He looked at Gavin, now holding the fish in his hand. \"Right. Well, shall we head back down, then?\" Gavin made to follow him, but I hesitated and, on a whim, pulled back the cover on the second crate. \"Oh, score,\" I said triumphantly. \"Gavin? Hang on a sec.\" The second crate was full of what looked like miniature eels, long, thin and slimy. Gavin saw them and gave another low chuckle. He dropped the fish he was holding and picked up one of them. Carl and I pulled the tarpaulin back on; I grabbed another eel just in case before we went back to the studio. Downstairs, the pile of scratched records had swollen incredibly and the stacks still on the shelves were dwindling. Gavin brought the eel up to his face and kissed it before slipping it between the desk and the record player where they couldn't find it. I shook my head at him. \"Amateur.\" I placed mine carefully on a shelf under the desk beside a pair of headphones, where some unsuspecting DJ would reach without looking and meet its slimy body. He laughed. I sat down on the floor between Simon and Angus, picked up a record and a knife and started scratching. The first rays of dawn were all that saved us from discovery. With Radio Sunshine's entire record collection maimed, we headed up the stairs again. \"Right,\" said the Count, \"are we all here?\" We looked around for each other. \"We're missing Mark,\" Simon noticed. \"Oh, Jesus. Dawn's coming, we've got to get back.\" We waited for a few seconds, then Midnight Mark, the sexiest man on the planet, stumbled up a completely different set of steps than the ones we'd been watching for him. \"Where the hell have you been?\" I asked him. \"With a girl,\" he replied calmly. The others whooped. I was left to contemplate how he managed it. Back on the longboat, we all cheered and high-fived each other triumphantly. \"Great work, guys,\" the Count congratulated. \"I'd like to see them messing with our listening numbers after that. \" A/N: Ok. So next chapter may be a while, and after that sappy Court/Gavin moment I'm having more and more trouble convincing even myself that they're not meant to be together, especially since there's another one next chapter. I might throw in a kiss somewhere. Review if you are pro/anti kiss. (I'm watching All About Steve, hence the pro/anti business). Anyway. Review. -for you.[Chapter 9] A/N: Haven't had time to proof-read yet, sorry. I'll do it later. \"Fuck.\" Sitting around the breakfast table with sheepish looks on their raccoon-like faces were most of the DJs. Kevin's 'fail-safe' pen had failed to come off. Carl nodded in response to my expletive. I grinned. \"When Dad sees you guys…\" \"Yup.\" The Count looked thoroughly unperturbed at the news that his death had been sealed by a few people's reluctance to accept that Kevin was genuinely, irretrievably thick . I grabbed a bowl and sat down next to Carl. \"How hard did you scrub it?\" I asked, poking his face gingerly. He flinched. \"Hard,\" he said in a hurt voice. I stifled a giggle. \"Oh, you guys are screwed.\" \"It was worth it, though,\" Simon affirmed. The others nodded emphatically. \"And we're not going to let you get off scott-free, Court, you know that.\" I grinned as he raised his voice so everyone could hear. \"All right, guys? If Quentin asks, it was Courtenay's idea.\" \"What was Courtenay's idea?\" We al jumped in unison at the sound of Dad's voice. Angus picked up a cereal box and covered his face. Carl tried to hide his in his breakfast bowl, with little success owing to the amount of milk still left in the bowl. Kevin, bless his soul, sat still with a surprised look on his face, the wide rings of black around his eyes making him look even more owlish than usual. \"Oh,\" Dad said in amused surprise. Then he shrugged it off. \"You should have a listen to Radio Sunshine,\" he said in a mock-worried tone. \"I'm afraid they've gone rather… off the ball.\" We all laughed, even Dad. \"Turn it on,\" the Count said eagerly. Dad complied, and sat down at the head of the table. \"I'm sorry about this, folks,\" the radio burbled happily, \"but we seem to be having a few technical tantrums this merry morrow.\" I made a face at Simon. \"But let's move on, let's groove on – here's the new sensational sound from the Move! This is Night of Fear .\" I snorted. I'd replaced that with a Christmas carol myself. \"And… no, it's not!\" Simon exclaimed triumphantly as someone's grainy recording of Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree echoed around the cabin. \"I think it's Brenda Lee.\" Angus and I mimed stashing guns back in our pockets. A new voice, deeper but just as mindlessly cheerful, came on as the record cut off sharply. \"Oh-kay!\" it laughed. \"Everything is copa sette – because Big Dave is here to the rock and roll rescue!\" Dave blew a raspberry at it. \"And let's listen to the palatable platter known as Gary Puckett while Bernard tries to figure out where he left his brain this morning!\" There was a smattering of nervous, over-enthusiastic laughter. \"And naughty Gary,\" the voice continued, \"is very interested in a very young girl.\" I laughed again. I'd seen that record on top of a pile with Gavin Kavanagh carved artfully into it. Sure enough, the record stuck halfway through the very first note. Gavin and I high-fived, awkwardly avoiding each other's eyes. \"Ohoho,\" Big Dave's voice came back on. \"Gary seems to be stuck in that relationship, huh…\" \"Not as stuck as you're going to be,\" the Count muttered. \"But you know who's not stuck in anything,\" the voice returned, \"because they have the best product in the entire world…\" I glanced at Dad. This was going better than any of us could have hoped. Dave chuckled at the sound of his own voice on the radio. \"Now this is what I call 'Big Dave',\" I said happily. \"Tense? Need to relax? No better way to do so than Night cigarettes. They'll give you cancer, and then you can sleep forever… oh… because you'll be dead.\" The Count slapped Dave on the back and took another drag on his own ever-present fag. I couldn't help but giggle at the irony. Someone on the other side switched off the ad and broke the silence. I sat up eagerly; Brainless Bernard was back. \"Okay! I think it's time we went to the weather! Katie, how's the weather looking?\" \"Oh!\" Gavin called silence over the triumphant chatter that had broken out over the advert. \"The weather!\" We were silent, waiting for Katie, everyone's eyes flicking between Dad and Mark. After the tuneless introductory jingle, ( \"the sun always shines on Radio Sunshine!\" ) there was a pause. Radio Rock held its breath. \"Well the weather is…\" the airy, ditzy-blonde voice paused again, then broke into a ridiculous giggle. \"Well, it's great. And last night…\" the beginnings of a snigger started up in Angus' throat. \"Was…\" we all looked at Mark with some sort of crude expectancy. \"Heaven.\" Much back-slapping and high-fiving ensued. I tell you, a response like that almost made me want to sleep with him, just to see what all the fuss was about. \"How do you do that, Mark?\" Felicity asked. Mark either didn't hear it over the congratulations, or just decided not to reply. \"Right,\" Dad said in a businesslike manner, making us all jump and sober up quickly: now we were in for it, surely. \"With Radio Sunshine taken care of –\" \"You say that like it was your idea,\" I butted in, surprised. Dad smiled thinly. \"You all thought I'd be angry, didn't you?\" We nodded dumbly. \"If you'd done what you did, and failed, I'd be angry.\" His grin widened. \"But as it stands, I think something had to be done about that… menace … and you handled it in style. Now I think most of you could do with a rest…\" he cast an amused look at those of us with blackened faces. \"And a decent facewash.\" The Count, Dave and I tittered at Angus, Simon, Carl and Kevin, all now rubbing their faces ruefully. \"So Radio Rock rules the waves once more, and ' life will be ecstasy, you and me, endlessly, grooving'.\" Gavin chuckled. \"Yeah,\" he complimented, and as though that was case closed, Dad switched off the buzzing radio and left the room. Smoking may not be terribly good for you, (though the Count was the worst chain-smoker I'd ever seen and he wasn't dead yet) but it was quite beautiful. It was dark, and I dangled my fag above black waves as I leaned over the deckrail on the side of the boat. The lights above the cabin doors caught the smoke as it twisted and spiralled into the ether. Lovely. I heard a door click and the telltale sounds of Cuban heels on the iron deck. I glanced around to see Gavin join me tentatively. \"Wonder if they've found our fish yet,\" he commented. I smirked. \"I don't think they'll ever find yours,\" I scolded, \"but someone'll have gotten a huge surprise when they found mine.\" He chuckled. \"I don't think they'll be messing with the Count again anytime soon.\" \"I don't think anybody will be messing with the Count for a while,\" I mused. I did, however, realise that the apparent end of my vendetta against Gavin also marked the end of the truce in the mock-battle between the Count and I. \"Except me, of course. But I'm fearless.\" He smiled, but he didn't understand. \"Courtenay, I just wanted to apologise,\" he said. I took a drag on my cigarette coolly and raised an eyebrow for him to continue. \"I know Quentin threatened to kick you off the boat after Elenore…\" he decided, wisely, not to finish that sentence. \"And I know that it was entirely my fault.\" I waited, but that appeared to be it. \"You know it's really uncanny when you apologise, don't you,\" I said ambiguously. He chuckled again. \"It's not something I do easily, or regularly,\" he admitted. \"But I think it's important we… get along. I treated you differently to the other DJs and I shouldn't have. I'm sorry.\" I grinned, tapping ash into the North Sea. \"Thank you,\" I said seriously, taking another drag. \"You're right,\" I added. It is imperative we get along, or Dad will probably make good on his threat to get rid of one of us, and despite his big talk that time, it won't be me.\" I sighed, eyeing him critically. \"You survived without this place for two years. I could never do that.\" \"Dunno if I could do it again, either,\" he mused. I looked at him, his strong profile framed against the dark, almost handsome in a rugged sort of way. \"I left two years ago to find some sort of meaning in life, you know?\" he gazed absently out into the night. \"Two years later I finally realised that the only place I'd ever find it was the one I'd left to look.\" I smiled. That was oddly poetic; maybe Gavin really wasn't that bad. \"A friend of mine once said, 'life should have music'. I didn't really understand what she meant… I said, 'life does have music', and she said 'no, I mean like in the background all the time, like a movie.\" I lifted the cigarette to my lips again. \"But it does, you know? You just have to be willing to listen.\" \"The thing that makes sense of this crazy world,\" he said, meeting my gaze for the first time, \"is rock and roll.\" I smiled. Neither of us said anything for a while; in the comfortable silence, my attention fell back onto the prettiness of the smoke curling away from the point of my cigarette. \"You know what I really want to be able to do?\" I said confessionally. \"What?\" \"Blow smoke rings.\" Gavin chuckled, hesitated, then carefully plucked the smoking cigarette from my fingers and took a long drag. I watched, wide-eyed, as he puckered up his lips and puffed; from those lips whooshed a perfect doughnut-shape. My mouth fell open. \"Oh my God,\" I said excitedly. \"How'd you do that?\" He grinned. \"You just take a really big breath and…\" he took another drag on my cigarette and blew another one. \"That's fantastic,\" I cried, taking the cigarette back and inhaling. I tried to imitate his lip action, but all that came out of my mouth was the usual cloud of smoke. \"No,\" he said, \"you've got to make the ring in your mouth first, and then sort of pop it out. You can't blow it out or it dissipates.\" I struggled not to laugh as I tried again. This time I was rewarded with a fat, shaky doughnut. I whooped in excitement and offered him the cigarette again. \"It works even better with coke,\" he said idly, repeating the miracle. I laughed. He handed it back and his eyes lingered on my face. \"Look at us,\" he said softly. \"A month ago you were trying to knock me out, and now we're sharing a cigarette.\" \"Yeah, well,\" I replied jokingly, \"you can do things with my cigarette I could only dream of.\" To my surprise, he didn't make a dirty joke out of the statement. \"I learned that in Australia,\" he said instead. \"You've been to Australia?\" I asked in surprise. \"Honey, I've been places you couldn't imagine,\" he said in his throaty radio voice. I laughed again. The door clicked open. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" came a distinctly American drawl. \"Am I interrupting.\" I turned to look at my beloved Count and flipped him the bird. \"Ooh, sorry,\" he said, sounding far too cheerful to be truly sorry. \"Looks like I am .\" Gavin looked confusedly from my face to the Count's. I knew I didn't look as angry as I was pretending to be, and the Count was even grinning like an idiot. \"You two really hate each other, don't you?\" he said sarcastically, though he sounded a little confused. \"Absolutely,\" I said immediately. \"Loathe one another,\" the Count agreed factually; but the wry grins that told Gavin our hatred was something of an inside joke were almost identical. \"I'm standing here in my favourite place on Earth with the two people I hate most in the whole world,\" I finished in the same tone. Gavin chuckled again. \"The times, they are a-changing,\" he commented idly. I laughed wryly. \"You have no idea,\" I said, and together we turned and went back inside. Of course, none of us really had any idea at all. A/N: I'm going to upload my epilogue right now; I apologise in advance for the distinctly Courtenay/Gavin ending. It wasn't supposed to end up like this. -for you![Chapter 10] A/N: Again, haven't proofread - or even reread, seeing as I typed it straight onto the computer without writing a hard-copy first, so it's probably crap. Sorry. Check again in a week or so, I may have changed it. \"Mum?\" I stood in one of those cute little red phone booths by the seaside, a towel around my shoulders, shivering. Dad and Gavin stood outside, peering nervously through the glass and trying to read my lips. \"Courtenay? Is that you?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Of course it's me, Mum. I'm on a payphone, so I don't have long.\" I started to tap one fingernail on the glass in impatience. Why was I doing this? I hated my mother. We couldn't live together now if you paid us. Which was, of course, what Dad planned to do. \"Well, what do you want, then?\" she asked impatiently. I gasped. \"Mum! It's your daughter calling, remember, the one you haven't spoken to in two and a half years? Haven't you been watching the news?\" \"The news?\" she asked. I could tell she had. \"Yeah, the bit about the government refusing to save the rebel pirate radio station that I happen to work for?\" I closed my eyes and rested my head against the glass. I'd be having nightmares for years. I felt like the Little Mermaid, buried under so much crushing water like too many blankets in summer , struggling to find which way was up. Ahead, the Count's American-made boots flashed in front of my eyes. I wriggled my own feet, cursing myself for not wearing less clothing that morning as my thick woollen jumper pulled me down. In the depths of my suffocation, I recognised the irony of the situation. I'd dived back into the bowels of the sinking ship to save a man I'd made a hefty pretence of hating since first we met. But I knew – well, I hoped – he'd have done the same for me had I been the stubborn one. I thought then, for the first time, that the Count was probably the best friend I had, besides Carl. Ordinarily, that wasn't something I wanted to know, but right then, when I was about to die for him, it was ok. Gavin had gone to get him right before we evacuated, but had come back empty-handed. That wasn't good enough for me. I'd dived back down into the already-submerged chambers of Radio Rock to find him. He was still broadcasting when I got there, up to his neck in water. As I treaded water and watched expectantly, the radio equipment gave a final squeak and died. \"Come on,\" I called desperately. \"We've got to go!\" He nodded and dived. Now I was drowning, slowly and painfully, as I waited for him to get his fat arse through the door. I'd heard someone say once that drowning was supposed to be a nice way to die, peaceful and tranquil. With roaring in my ears and my head threatening to explode, lungs screaming, every muscle hurting through lack of oxygen, I really wanted to find that person and hold them underwater too. It fucking hurt. Peace was the last thing on my mind. The Count finally managed to push himself through the door – I'm sure it would have been easier had the ship not been tilted alarmingly so that the door was above our heads – and I kicked my way after him, my vision blurring, eyes burning from the salt water. Ahead, the Count's coat got caught on the doorknob. I swore as loudly as I could in my head, but I still couldn't hear it over the constant roar of the water pouring in over the top of us. I felt my oxygen leaking away drop by drop as I stopped to help him; by the time I'd untwisted the leather jacket, all I could see was vague shapes in the dark as my brain shut down. Then all was darkness. \"Yes, I heard,\" Mum said quietly. \"Tom rang and told me. Are you all right?\" My eyes flickered open again at the note of concern in her voice, the only thing that gave away the fact that surely she must have been worried for me. \"I'm fine, Mum,\" I whispered. \"But I… I need somewhere to stay until I can get back on my feet again.\" There was a long silence, and for a minute I thought she was going to refuse. \"Of course, darling. Of course you can stay here.\" I took a deep breath in. \"Um… It's just… Dad needs somewhere too.\" Another long silence. I made a face at Dad through the window and he smiled wearily back. \"He can't stay here. Courtenay, sweetheart, your father can find his own place.\" \"Well…\" I held his eyes through the glass. \"Mum, he's got nowhere else to go. You won't even know he's there, honestly. None of us. Dad will pay rent for the three of us –\" \"Three of you?\" I flinched. Oops. \"Who else are you bringing?\" \"Um…\" I fought back a momentary urge to giggle at what her reaction was going to be. \"Have you heard of Gavin Kavanagh?\" I coughed violently and, as though in slow motion and on fire, vomited agonisingly all over the deck of the boat. Then I registered that I was on a boat and opened my eyes. They screamed in agony at their exposure to the air, still stinging from their recent salt bath. My chest hurt, and my throat was aching from the coughing I was still doing. But as my eyes teared up and calmed down, I registered a face. Gavin knelt over me, his hands still in CPR position underneath my breasts, tears streaking down his face. \"Come on, Court,\" he said desperately. I coughed weakly. \" Okay,\" I said finally. He looked up, hope shining through his face; I tried to smile but every inch of me hurt. \" Courtenay!\" he pulled me into the tightest hug I'd ever had. I screamed; he was clutching me so hard that even if I hadn't hurt already my bones would have snapped. \"Oh, fuck, sorry,\" he said, putting me down. \"Are you okay?\" \" No,\" I said shortly. \"The Count – where's the Count?\" \" Right here,\" came his voice. Gavin helped me to sit up until I could see him, sitting with his back against the side of the yacht we were in and being fussed over by numerous girls. \"Thanks for coming back for me.\" I smiled weakly. \"No problem. Thanks for saving me.\" He shrugged nonchalantly. \"It wasn't me. I dragged you out of the boat, but I thought you were dead until Gavin started giving you mouth to mouth.\" I looked at Gavin. He looked back at me. \"Couldn't do it while you were conscious, sweetheart,\" he said apologetically. I kept staring at him absently. He had saved my life. So I kissed him; it seemed only fair. After I'd planted my lips on his I realised it was probably less than desirable considering I'd just vomited a stomachful of seawater everywhere, but he seemed to be enjoying it. He clutched me tight again – I flinched – and his tongue flicked around mine in interesting ways. It was oddly wonderful. As we broke apart the first thing I noticed was the over-patient expression on the Count's face. All right. So many people had told me so. Gavin chuckled again and I looked at his face; he gestured out around us, so I looked. There were hundreds of yachts and dinghies and fishing boats and rowboats surrounding the bubbles and record covers that was once Radio Rock , all carrying devoted fans. On one boat I saw Carl in Marianne's arms, his lips moving in words that I was pretty sure would be 'I told you so' if I was close enough to hear them. On another I saw Dad, grinning knowledgeably at me. Simon, Angus, Mark, Dave and even Bob were all facing the three of us on the one boat, smiling and raising cigarettes or champagne glasses or just hands at us. I saw Mark's lips move, then Dave's mimick the movement, then Angus'. Gavin bent his head and kissed me again, gently, tenderly, and when we broke apart we echoed the others in unison. \" Rock and Roll.\" \"Of course I've heard of Gavin Kavanagh,\" Mum replied. \"I used to fall asleep listening to him every night because you wouldn't turn your radio down.\" There was a hint of a smile in her voice. \"Well,\" I pressed my advantage, \"he saved my life last night and he doesn't have anywhere to go either.\" That, of course, was the clincher. He saved my life last night . That one did it. She couldn't refuse after that. \"Am I going to have enough room for all three of you?\" I breathed out for the first time since I'd mentioned Dad. \"Of course. Gavin and I will share my old room.\" My stomach wobbled slightly at the thought. Mum sniffed. \"So you're with some rock and roll DJ now?\" she asked huffily. \"Come on, Mum, you know how that feels,\" I told her slyly. She actually laughed. \"Two weeks,\" she said. \"You can bring your horde for two weeks, and I will tolerate your father's presence not a moment longer.\" I started the long business of thanking her. \"And sweetie?\" I shut up promptly. \"Hold onto him while you can. From my experience it'll be over before you know it.\" I looked out at Gavin. He was in deep and serious-looking conversation with Dad – no doubt getting the 'hurt-her-and-you-die' speech – but when he knew I was looking he looked around and grinned at me. I gave him the thumbs-up. \"Thanks, Mum,\" I said cheerfully. \"We're on our way.\" I hung up the phone and shut the door behind me. \"Well?\" asked Dad expectantly. \"Of course we can stay,\" I said. \"But you have to hide behind me every time we walk past her.\" Dad looked at Gavin. \"Don't get Courtenay pregnant and then leave her,\" he told him drearily. \"You'll regret it later.\" We joined the rest of the DJs, still standing on the beach surrounded by fans. I signed a couple of autographs and then caught Dad's eye again. I grabbed Gavin. \"We have to go,\" I said soberly. And together we walked away from Radio Rock , away from the ocean and the pile of records that people had managed to fish out of it, away from the old life, and towards the new one. THE END A /N: All right, all right. Lame ending. I honestly hadn't planned to have Gavin and Court actually get together - I thought just one kiss - but the romantic side of me got jealous.

Contain yourself!\" Brenda said with a smile, I knew she was excited to see Cassie. \"I can't help it!\" I replied happily. Migo and his friends from the S.E.S. were confused by my behavior. \"Who are we waiting for again?\" Meechee asked us in confusion. I turned to my Yeti friends and explained that my cousin Cassie is coming and that she's the one who built the translators for us. \"She made them?\" Kolka asked amazement, I remember that the translators were for me to use when I was near other animals. \"Yep! I can't wait until she sees that her invention allows us to communicate.\" I replied to her, just then Brenda tapped me on the shoulder. I turned to see a snowmobile stop a few feet away and the person took off their helmet. \"That was a long trip.\" A soft voice said to herself. My Yeti friends were surprised to see a sixteen year old girl with light tan skin, fiery red hair that was shoulder-length with blue-gray eyes. I saw that she was wearing a pink winter jacket with a long blue sleeved shirt sticking out of it along with dark blue jeans and white gloves. Brenda took note of her pink snow boots. \"CASSIE!\" Brenda and I shouted happily, Cassie was startled a bit as she turned to face us. \"Hey you guys, long time no see.\" Cassie replied with a smile, I hugged my cousin tightly. \"Cuz, I can't breath.\" Cassie told me, I let go. I apologized and she just laughed it off before hugging Brenda. \"What's with the Yeti's?\" Cassie asked us, she hid behind me a little. Brenda and I told Cassie the whole story about how I met the Yeti's and then added that her translators allow us to communicate. \"Wow...I didn't see that coming.\" Cassie said in shock, she got over that and introduced herself to the Yeti's and they did the same. We all took this time for them to get to know my cousin and she told us what she's been up to at school before it was closed down. \"...so the teacher tell us to be careful during the project but the twins decided to do it their way.\" Cassie told us, Fleem asked what happened. \"They blew the whole science department up and after everyone evacuated, the principle told us he was shutting the school down.\" Cassie replied. \"What for?\" Gwangi asked her, I wanted to know as well. \"It's so the school can be repaired.\" Cassie answered him, so now we know the reason. Just then I saw the Stonekeeper coming our way. \"Meechee, your father.\" I told her, she turned and saw her Dad. \"Daddy!\" Meechee greeted. \"It's time to come back.\" Stonekeeper told them, the five Yeti's were upset that they had to leave so I glanced to my cousin silently asking. \"Before you go...how about a lullaby?\" Cassie asked as her face redden, my friends nodded 'yes' happily while Stonekeeper was wary. [Play Cossack Lullaby with English Lyrics] [ Cassie ] Sleep, good boy, my beautiful, Bayushki bayu Quietly the moon is looking Into your cradle. I will tell you fairy tales And sing you little songs, But you must slumber, with you little eyes closed, Bayushki bayu. The time will come, then you will learn The pugnacious life, Boldly you'll stem your foot into the stirrup And take the gun. The saddle-cloth for your battle horse I will sew you from silk. Sleep now, my dear little child, Bayushki bayu. You will look like a hero And be a Cossack deep in your heart. I will hurry to accompany you, You will just wave your hand How many secret bitter tears Will I shed that night! Sleep, now, my dear little child, Bayushki bayu. I will die from longing, I will wait inconsolably, I will pray the whole day long, And at night I'll tell fortunes I will think that you are in trouble Far away in a foreign land. Sleep now, as long as you don't know sorrows, Bayushki bayu. I will give you on your way A small holy icon, And when you pray to God, you'll Put it right in front of you When preparing yourself for the dangerous fight Please remember your mother. Sleep, good boy, my beautiful, Bayushki bayu. Everyone except Brenda and I were stunned by Cassie's beautiful singing. \"That was pretty.\" Kolka cooed, Cassie smiled and blushed. \"Thank you.\" Cassie replied shyly. \"What language b was that?\" Migo asked her, she told him that the song was in Russian and that she learned it from her friend who lives in Russia. \"Wow.\" Migo responded in awe. I noticed that the Stonekeeper was entranced by my cousin's singing. \"Maybe she can help him understand us humans.\" I muttered, my friends headed home for the night. Brenda, Cassie and I then went back to the hotel so we could talk about our plans for tomorrow and how Cassie can help us teach our friends about humans before we fell asleep. First chapter done! I don't own the movie Smallfoot or the song in this chapter, please review and no flames![Chapter 2] Cassie pov: Today Percy and I are hanging out with some of the Yeti's since he insisted that I help teach them. \"What exactly do you want me to do?\" I asked Percy, we were almost to the meeting place. \"Teach them about human music.\" Percy replied. I had no idea why he wanted me to teach the Yeti's about human music but I still agreed. \"We're here.\" Percy told me, I smiled in relief. Migo and Meechee came to get us so it'd be easier to climb the mountains. \"You two ready?\" Migo asked us, we nodded yes. On the way to the top, Meechee and I talked about the places I've been to since I liked to travel when I can and see my friends. \"What's the rest of your family like?\" Meechee asked me, I froze at that question then looked to Percy for help so he helped me. Percy thankfully got Meechee's attention by telling her and Migo that I was going to teach them about human music today after yesterday. A little while later, the four of us were at the very top of the Himalayan Mountains and the view was very breathtaking so I took a picture. \"I am so excited to learn about human music.\" Kolka said happily, Gwangi looked like the type who'd be into rap music since it felt right. Fleem on the other hand wasn't sure about the lesson because he started up a pro's and con's list which made me laugh so he stopped. I noticed that a ton of other Yeti's had gathered to learn about music. \"Why the huge turn out?\" I asked Kolka, she smiled at me. \"We told them about the lullaby you sang to us so they wanted to hear you sing.\" Kolka responded, I don't know how to react to that. So I shook my head then began the lesson and during that I played different types of sounds from my computer for the Yeti's. \"Why make so many different sounds?\" Thorp asked me, he's Meechee's brother. \"It helps create the music.\" I answered him. This made some of the younger Yeti's ask me to sing to them and since they gave me an adorable look, I couldn't say no to them. So I got out my I-pod then chose the best and most heartfelt song I had, when I looked up I saw the Stonekeeper in the crowed. [Play Watashi No Koe from Beautiful Word, Beautiful World] [ Cassie ] Watashi no koe sayounara Ano yama no saki no Fukaku nemuru mizu umi ni Itteshimatta Hito no kokoro kizutsukeru Kanashi kotoba wa Kuchi ni shitakunai to naki Itteshimatta Ohayou konnichiwa Gokigen wa ikaga Arifureta yaritori ga Ima wa koishii Watashi no koe kieta koto Minna yorokonda Minna watashi no kotoba wo Kiratteru kara Oioi to naki nagara Satte itta koe Noko safeta watashi wa mou Naku koto dekizu! At the end of the song, I saw all of the Yeti's had been stunned into silence but then started to cheer for me. \"Thank you.\" I said with a smile, they left to create more music. \"That song was beautiful but what language was that?\" The Stonekeeper asked me, I was surprised that he was talking to me. \"It's in Japanese.\" I replied slowly to him. The Stonekeeper then polity excused himself since he had some work to attend to...and I was left alone to my thought's about the Yeti leader for some reason. I wanted to know more about the Stonekeeper since he was mysterious and that only made me want to solve the puzzle that is the Stonekeeper, game on! Meechee then came to get me since it was time for Percy and I to head back to the hotel but even then I wanted to stay though sadly I couldn't or I'd get sick. Next time Percy and I come up here, I was gonna find the Stonekeeper and hopefully get to spend time with him so we can talk about the culture differences. New chapter done! I don't own the song in this chapter please review and no flames![Chapter 3] Third Person pov: Over the last few days, Cassie had been trying to talk to the Stonekeeper. But it was hard since he always disappeared into his home or had to oversee the younger Yeti's lessons so he didn't have time. Cassie was more determined to talk to the Yeti leader so she sneakily followed him around trying to find the right moment. \"It's weird right?\" Fleem asked his friends, they watched as Cassie hid from the Stonekeeper so he didn't see her yet. \"She's curious about the differences between our cultures so she wanted dad to teach her.\" Meechee told them, Percy smiled a bit. \"That sounds like my cousin alright.\" Percy commented, he'd always known that Cassie was a curious girl and she'd want answers. The Stonekeeper had known he was being followed. \"Will you please stop it?\" Stonekeeper asked Cassie, she came out of hiding. \"Can we talk?\" Cassie asked him, Stonekeeper sighed but led the young teen to his cave where they could talk in private instead. Cassie started asking questions about the Yeti's culture and the Stonekeeper answered them but became silent on one question. \"You want to know why we Yeti's went up the mountain?\" Stonekeeper asked Cassie, she stayed silent but nodded 'yes' to him. The Stonekeeper took Cassie to the hall of the Stonekeepers and told her of all the bad things humans had done to Yeti kind. Cassie was scared of the Yeti's bad history when it came to humans and she thought back to how really cruel her kind could be. \"Humans aren't like this anymore but I still don't know about coexistence.\" Stonekeeper said with a sigh, Cassie knew what to do. [Play Strange Sight from Tinkerbell and the legend of the Neverbeast] [ Cassie ] Strange sight You stand in the light You're wrong but you're right My hearts beating wildly Strange How I'm scared but delighted Afraid but excited too You have a cold heart You're reckless and distant But I'll be persistent I will understand you Strange How I'm drawn to the danger I'll reach out my hand to you Do you long to be left all alone? Set apart with a heart made of stone Let me help, let's begin Let me learn, won't you let me in? All the light, let it show You are a strange sight Some new kind of wonder With good hidden under I'm sure that it's true Strange How your dark doesn't faze me No, I won't give up on you Do you long to be left all alone? Set apart with a heart made of stone Let me help, let's begin Let me learn, won't you let me in? All the light, let it show If you're caught in the shadow then turn around Lost in the darkness, you will be found If you hear my voice, follow the sound 'Cause I'm here to guide you home Do you long to be left all alone? Set apart with a heart made of stone Let me help, let's begin Let me learn, won't you let me in? All the light, let it show Do you long to be left all alone? Set apart with a heart made of stone There's a light that you shine There's a love, I see it in your eyes All the dark, let it go You're not alone! After Cassie was done singing, she opened her eyes and looked at the Stonekeeper. \"I'm sorry for everything we humans did to you Yeti's.\" Cassie said with a sad smile. The Stonekeeper didn't say anything for a bit. \"It's alright but now we can change things for the better.\" Stonekeeper told her, the two knew they can coexist. Cassie and the Stonekeeper decided to hang out from then on but only after they were done with their jobs or when they had free time so they could talk to each other. Just then Cassie felt a chill go down her spine but it wasn't because she was cold, but she felt that something or someone was coming to ruin everything. Meanwhile, Percy was hanging out with Migo and the S.E.S. when he felt the chill go down his spine and he became uneasy since he's had this feeling before. \"If that's who I think it is...then we're in trouble!\" Cassie and Percy thought in worry, they only hoped that they could stop him before he hurt anyone or did worse. New chapter done! I don't own the song in this chapter, please review and no flames![Chapter 4] Migo pov: My friends and I were heading to the human village to hang out with Percy and Cassie. \"I hope Cassie will sing to us again!\" Kolka said happily, all of us liked it when Cassie sang. \"You can't take her!\" Percy's voice rang out. \"Percy?\" I said in worry, the five us ran to where Percy and Cassie were at. \"She's my daughter and I'll do as I please.\" A man replied. The man almost looks like Percy only he had brown hair. \"Daddy, please just leave!\" Cassie said with a whimper, she was scared. \"Uncle Bailey, you're not suppose to be near Cassie.\" Percy told him, I noticed that Percy was in front of Cassie to protect her. Bailey scoffed then saw us. \"Are those beasts the reason why you came?!\" Bailey asked in anger, Cassie and Percy turned to us. They paled a little bit. \"They aren't beasts!\" Cassie shouted at him, Bailey got out a gun and smirked at Percy and Cassie. Before Bailey could shoot us, Cassie pounced on him and they began to fight but then 'BANG!' Cassie screamed in pain. \"CASSIE!\" We all shouted in worry, Bailey shoved Cassie off him then kicked her in the stomach and laughed at her. Percy ran to help his cousin while calling the police along with the hospital. \"Hang on Cassie.\" Percy pleaded, she coughed. My friends and I glared at Bailey. \"That will show you your place!\" Bailey said with a smirk, he turned to leave but stopped. We all saw Cassie get up and glare at her father. \"You'll pay for that.\" Cassie seethed, she turned on some music to play. [Play Born Ready from Marvel Rising by Dove Cameron] [ Cassie ] Ready, set, time to be a fighter Don't look down keep on climbing Higher Be yourself 'cause hero's shine In different ways And when your voice can't make A sound Just know we hear you all Around Don't need to fit into the crowd To be a force of nature 'Cause we're gonna be We're gonna be We're gonna be the best They're gonna see They're gonna see That we were born for this So if it takes forever We'll save the world together We we're born ready We we're born ready Yeah, Yeah, Yeah And if your heart surrenders We'll hold it our together We we're born ready We we're born ready Don't care if the world ain't ready for me (Music) So, if it takes forever We'll save the world together We we're born ready We we're born ready Yeah, Yeah, Yeah And if your heart surrenders We'll hold it out together We we're born ready We we're born ready Don't care if the world ain't ready for me Don't care if the world ain't ready for me Don't care if the world ain't ready for me We we're born ready We we're born ready Don't care if the world ain't ready for me Don't care if the world ain't ready for me! By the end of the song, Bailey was down for the count but Cassie was worn out from fighting her dad so she passed out from the fight and pain from her injury. The police came and got Cassie's father while the ambulance took Cassie to the hospital. \"Will she be okay?\" Gwangi asked Percy, we all worried for her. \"I'll let you know when I know.\" Percy said sadly, he went after the ambulance. \"We should go home.\" Meechee said softly, we went back home and told everyone. The kids kept asking when we'll know if Cassie will be alright. \"We'll know when Percy tells us.\" I replied gently, the kids wanted Cassie to come back fast. I locked eyes with the Stonekeeper and saw that he was worried for Cassie but happy proud of her for protecting us. \"She'll be okay.\" I whispered firmly. New chapter done! Will Cassie make it after she shot? Find out in the next chapter! I don't own the song in this chapter but I own Bailey.[Chapter 5] Meechee pov: It's been at least two weeks since Cassie got out of the hospital and she's doing alright. Percy had told us that she had to get surgery to help get the bullet out of her arm and then she had to go to court. \"Guys! I'm fine!\" Cassie told us, we all had to make sure that she didn't strain herself. \"Just making sure.\" Migo replied gently. Cassie's face softened. \"I know but I can still walk.\" Cassie responded, we got to the village and everyone was happy to see Cassie. All the kids ran up to her and asked all kinds of questions to which she answered carefully so no one got the wrong idea about that day. Cassie and Percy told everyone that Bailey would be sent to prison for almost shooting us and for hurting Cassie since she was six years old. That made everyone happy and upset, happy that Bailey won't be a problem but upset that Cassie had to deal with him for a long time. When Cassie saw the looks on everyone's faces, she sighed but knew how to cheer us up so she took out her I-pod and played music. [Play Wings of a Dream from Card captor Sakura] [ Cassie ] A twinkle in the night sky far far away. A golden star I gaze upon in my dreams. On a sleepless evening I sing alone. Tomorrow I'll sing with you on the wings of a dream. On a sleepless evening I sing alone. Tomorrow I'll sing with you on the wings of a dream. The song helped everyone calm down and the kids loved it. \"So...where's your Dad?\" Cassie asked me, I chuckled at her question then took her to my home. We went to the hall of Stonekeepes where my Dad was. \"Guess who's back!\" I called out happily, Dad turned and zeroed in on Cassie who smiled at him. \"Cassie...\" Dad said in shock, he thought that Cassie wouldn't make through the surgery or that she wouldn't be able to come to our village anymore. I saw the look that Daddy was giving Cassie and I knew that look. \"He was worried about Cassie!\" I thought, no one thought Dad would be worried. Cassie and I thought it would be a good idea for Daddy to hear her sing so he'd be able to calm down so she sang a different song this time. [Play Country Roads English version from Whisper of the heart] [ Cassie ] I dreamed of living alone but fearless, Secret longing to be courageous Loneliness kept bottled up inside, Just reveal your brave face they'll Never know you lied. Country Road may lead me home, Know I belong there all on my own Destiny calls, motionless I stall, No I can't go, Country Road. No matter how dark the world's inside me I'll never stop to show a tear that I've shed, but now I have to walk so fast, running, sprinting to forget What is lodged in my head. Oh country road, may lead me home, know I belong There all on my own. Destiny calls, motionless I stall no I can't go country roads. Country road, la la la. You're a good friend I'll never know. Same tomorrow, regret and sorrow, Can't take you home. Country Road! Thanks to Cassie's song, Daddy calmed down. I'm so happy you're alright.\" Daddy said happily, Cassie smiled and hugged him. \"How sweet.\" I cooed, Daddy blushed. Cassie laughed but I saw that her face turned red a little bit. \"We should head back.\" Cassie told us, we went back to everyone to celebrate Cassie's return to us. New chapter done! I don't own either songs in this chapter, please review and flames also sorry if it's short.[Chapter 6] Cassie pov: After everyone got ready for my return party, Percy helped set up a karaoke machine. \"This is going to be fun!\" Meechee said with a smile, I agreed with her as I watched. \"You sure I can't help?\" I asked her. My friends stilled wanted me to rest my left arm. \"Positive.\" Meechee replied firmly, I rolled my eyes at motherly side. \"She's only looking out for you, you know.\" Stonekeeper told me, I chuckled and shook my head. \"I know.\" I responded. Soon everything was ready and the party began. \"Ready for some karaoke?!\" I shouted/asked happily, everyone cheered. All the yeti's got a chance to sing and so did Percy, we even got the Stonekeeper to sing a song which I smiled at. \"That was pretty good.\" Percy commented, Stonekeeper had chosen the song 'Poco Loco' from the movie 'COCO'. Once everyone had a turn to sing they asked me to sing so I picked the one song that I played when I living with my Dad. [Play Fine on the Outside by Priscilla Ahn] [ Cassie ] I never had that many friends growing up So I learned to be okay with just me Just me, just me And I'll be fine on the outside I like to eat in the school by myself anyway So I'll stay right here Right here, right here, right here And I'll be fine on the outside So I just sit in my room After hours with the moon And think of who knows my name Would you cry if I died?

Once karaoke was done Migo should Percy, Brenda and I how to play some yeti games with their help but it was fun playing their kind of games for the party. \"You okay?\" Brenda asked me, she and I were taking a break. \"I'm a lot better then before.\" I replied honestly, and it was true that I felt much better now. Percy and Brenda knew what my life was like since my father hurt me while my mother and other relatives flat out ignored me but Percy didn't hurt me like that. We kept talking until Stonekeeper came by. \"You were right.\" Stonekeeper said with a smile, I was confused by what he was even talking about so he clarified. \"That while some humans will try to hurt us, not all humans are like that.\" Stonekeeper explained, I blushed beet red since he knew what happened in town. \"It will take time but our worlds will become one.\" I replied with a smile, our kinds are taking those first steps but we'll get there and hopefully soon. One day our worlds will live together side by side and when that day comes, I'll be by my friends side no matter what, we'll always be together forever. Last chapter done!

Original characters belong to me. Prologue Mystic Rock Harbor in British Columbia was in full swing, but it was not of the good kind. Weather meteorologists from almost every TV news station had given the same warning to residents who lived on the west coast of British Columbia. A severe autumn storm was forming in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. The meteorologists warned the people living along the west coast that the storm would have strong gusty winds, powerful lightning strikes, basketball sized hail, and heavy rain. As soon as the residents of Mystic Rock Harbor heard that they were in the path of the storm, they immediately headed out to retrieve food, water, batteries, and other necessary items that would help them survive. For those who lived close to the beaches were ordered to boarder up windows and doors and if they desire, they were welcome to stay in the schools that were used as shelters. However, there were few who flocked to the gun shops before they boarded up. These folks had informed the owners that the guns they were buying were for protection after the storm, in case of looters. \"Gotta protect our own turf,\" one elderly cat humanoid said, \"A lot of people will do crazy things after a storm.\" However, there was one person, a dog humanoid who purchased a gun who gave a different explanation, \"There are some rodents that I need to take care of, rats tend to go crazy during a storm.\" He bought a pistol and left the gun shop, although the owners did not suspect a thing. ()()()()()()()() Out on the beaches, the waves came crashing to the shore in gigantic proportions. There were a few people out on the water, enjoying some time before the weather turned ugly. The houses that had an ocean view had their windows and glass doors boarded up and the patio furniture were locked up inside their sheds, although there was a possibility that the sheds would be destroyed in the storm. At one of the beaches, an elderly rat woman was suffering from a weather-sensing migraine. \"It is coming, I can feel it in my head,\" she said to her husband, who nodded. The two were watching the clouds that were heading towards the town. Just then, the sirens blared across the town and the Mystic Rock Harbor P.D. called out on the speaker phones on the poles all over town. \"This is the Mystic Rock Harbor P.D., all citizens are to take shelter immediately! I repeat, all citizens are to take shelter immediately!\" Captain Davey Biggins said. In an instant, all of the residents of the town closed up their doors and sought shelter inside their homes or businesses. The town's streets were deserted in under a minute, apart from a few feral animals who went to find their own shelter. Now all the people can do was to wait and pray.[Chapter 2] Chapter 1 In the Swagger household, Angel was giving her three year old daughter, Emmy a quick bath before the worst was to come. Emmy played with the bubbles and Angel blew on some of them, making them move on the water. It had been over a month since Angel closed the case of the 'Beach Killer Murders'. Angel and her husband, Mok moved on with their lives, especially with their daughter. Just then, Angel snapped back to reality when she and Emmy heard the sirens outside. \"Mommy, what is that?\" Emmy asked, having not heard the sound before. \"That is a siren, the storm is getting close,\" Angel replied and took Emmy out of the tub and dried her off. Angel helped Emmy into pajamas and brushed her teeth and took her to bed. Mok came in and noticed how quickly Emmy fell asleep. \"I used the baby bubble bath, it will help her sleep through the whole thing,\" Angel said to him. \"I am not so sure, I have a feeling that this storm is going to be a nasty one,\" he replied, peeking through the wooden boards on the window. \"Do you think we should've gone to the school?\" Angel asked, feeling her husband's nervousness. \"No, somehow, we'll make it through,\" Mok replied and kissed his wife's forehead. They left their daughter's room and went to the living room, where they watched the weather news on TV. Reporters were out on piers or docks pointing to the dark clouds on the horizon and there were a few lightning strikes. \"The best for the residents of Mystic Rock Harbor is to stay in the lower part of their homes and do not go out in the storm as you saw that there is lightning and basketball sized hail will fall and it will likely be fatal,\" one reporter said. An news anchor woman tells the audience, \"We also advise everyone to be stocked up on food, batteries, toiletries, water, and medical supplies as this storm will cause power outages. Be aware that the electric companies are on stand-by, but they will not restore power until the storm has passed.\" \"Have you experienced anything like this in your youth?\" Angel asked her husband. \"A few times, but they were not at all pleasant. My father always kept saying, \"Don't know why this causing a lot of panic, it's no big deal.\" However, everytime the storms hit, the windows that had not been boarded up would break and glass scattered everywhere in my apartment. \"My father, being drunk as he was, slept through the whole ordeal, while my mother and I went to our apartment's basement. By the time the storm passed, we would find my father on the bed, sleeping away without a care in the world,\" Mok explained. \"With no scratch on him?\" Angel asked, flabbergasted. \"Nope,\" Mok answered. Angel took a quick peek through the wooden boards and saw that the dark clouds were getting closer to the shore. ()()()()()()()()()() Elsewhere in the town, in a one-story house, a female dog humanoid had been panicking ever since she heard the sirens. \"I think it's getting closer,\" she said to her husband. \"Will you relax? It'll pass in no time,\" he answered, he could feel the weight of the pistol in his holster. The couple's two children were also fearful for their lives and they cuddled together in a corner. \"Honestly, you three are old enough to know that storms will go by and you're safe in this house,\" the male dog humanoid informed them. \"And if you don't shut up and behave, I will shot you like dogs,\" he added, but he didn't reveal the pistol. \"Honey, you don't mean that, do you?\" his wife asked, but her husband just chuckled. It wasn't until later, that the dark clouds hovered over the town, the wind picked up, and the lightning and thunder struck. Heavy rain came down really fast, much like a waterfall. The dog humanoid family were still in the living room, listening to the storm. The lights began to flicker, but then, a loud thunderclap boomed and the electricity went out. \"It's happening! Oh gods! Please take me and my babies!\" the wife exclaimed, cradling her teenage children. The husband did his best to ignore his family's unbearable excitement. He had done it before, but this was the last straw. \"Will you just shut up?!\" he yelled at his wife, but that only made things worse. The wife began to shake and, much like a real dog, began to whimper and so did her children. \"Alright, that's it!\" the husband shouted and pulled out the pistol, \"I said that I will shoot all of you like dogs!\" he yelled, pointing the gun at their faces. \"Alan, please, we won't-\" but the wife didn't get to finish as her husband shot one round into her forehead and she was dead before she hit the floor. The two children screamed as they stared at their dead mother, but their father shouts, \"Enough! Now go outside!\" Having no choice, they followed their father's instructions and headed out into the storm, with the father carrying his dead wife on his shoulders. The father had his children walk down the street, gun in hand, and he was getting drenched by the rain. Thunder boomed and lightning cracked. The children whimpered and their father ordered them to stop outside of the run-down dock they lived close to. He dropped his wife's body on the ground and turned his attention to his children. \"You three have been nothing, but trouble,\" he said to them and then, a loud thunderclap echoed across the sky, just as the culprit shot both his children in the back. He hurried to the dock, where the waves were atrocious and slamming against the wooden piers. The culprit threw the pistol into the sea, hoping that the waves would take it to the depths. Seeing that the job was done, he hurried back to his home, where he changed clothes and went to sleep on the couch.[Chapter 3] Chapter 2 Angel awoke to the sound of the monstrous wind and booming thunder outside. She realized that the electricity had gone out and she peeked through the boards on one of the windows. Lightning touched down almost everywhere, thunder boomed so loud that it would make anyone go deaf, and Angel heard the hail pounding on the roof. Suddenly, a lightning strike hit very close to the house, but it hit a nearby tree. It splintered opened and it crashed down close to the patio. \"Mommy!\" Angel heard her daughter scream as she had been awakened. \"Boss, we better get downstairs,\" Toad commanded, while his brothers and sister, Cindy went down to the lower part of the house. \"Stay with me, we're going to get Emmy,\" Mok ordered and he, Toad, and Angel went to the little girl's room. Thunder boomed, again, and Mok opened the door to his daughter's room where Emmy was crying and cradling a stuffed animal. \"It's going to be okay, sweetie, c'mon, we're going downstairs,\" Angel said, taking her daughter in her arms and they hurried down the steps, using a flashlight for guidance. They reached the basement, where the Swagger family and their employees listened to the howling wind, crackling thunder, and the pounding of hail. It almost sounded like a war raging on outside. No one spoke a word, Cindy turned on the radio, but all they got was static. Emmy cuddled by her parents and they listened for a short while until Emmy asks, \"When will it be over?\" \"It's hard to say, it could take a few minutes or maybe more than an hour, but it will end soon,\" Mok said to his daughter. Emmy yawned, but she didn't want to go to sleep as she was afraid of the storm. \"If you're tired, you can sleep, we'll stay up and watch,\" Angel said to her little girl. \"But I'm scared,\" Emmy replied. \"It's alright to be scared of a big storm,\" Mok said and adds, \"In fact, I'm scared, too.\" \"I thought grown-ups aren't afraid of anything,\" Emmy replied, staring up at her father. \"They can get scared, in fact, I was scared for what happened this pass summer, mainly because of if anything were to happen to you and your mother,\" the retired rock star informed Emmy. \"We should get some rest, I'm sure the storm will be over by morning,\" Angel said, but Emmy didn't want to go to sleep. Mok thought of a brilliant idea and began to sing. V'là l' bon vent V'là l' joli vent V'là l' bon vent M'amie m'appelle V'là l' bon vent V'là l' joli vent V'là l' bon vent M'amie m'attend Mok's mother sang this song when their were wind storms when he was young and it sent him to sleep in no time. Emmy listened to her father and she fell asleep as she cuddled between her parents. \"Let's turn out the lights, save the batteries,\" Toad said to his siblings and they shut off the flashlights, engulfing everyone in total darkness. From the author: Sorry for the short chapter, I wanted to save the exciting part for the next one. The song Mok had sang is called ' V'là l' bon vent' or 'Here Comes the Wind', a French Canadian folk song.[Chapter 4] Chapter 3 By morning, the storm had passed, but it left a trail of destruction in its wake. Power lines were down with some wires flickering as they had been detached from their fuse boxes. Some trees had been uprooted and some had crashed onto houses, cars, and on the street. Sand that had been blown by the powerful wind was everywhere. Roofs had been torn off, but there were few that had stayed intact. Windows that had not been boarded up were broken and glass scattered everywhere. The clouds were still a cold gray and a gentle wind blew into town. The people began to venture out of their secured homes where they found the town in a near-ruined state. With no time to waste, the town's people began to look for any survivors in houses that had collapsed during the storm. Emergency personnel set up tents in the middle of town, where they would treat the injured. Some of the business owners, however, protected their own turf from looters by threatening to shoot them on the spot. The town's police force had their work cut out as they searched for survivors, bringing in the injured, and arresting any thieves who were stupid in their heists. The Swagger house was one of few surviving structures that were close to the beach, with only a few roof tiles that been blown away, and the sand piled up to the patio. The Swagger's, with their employees emerged from the house, unscathed. Mok, having Emmy in his arms, looked around the landscape, and breathed a sigh of relief. \"The best part about this is that we are alive,\" he said and Angel rested her head on his shoulder. The first thing they did was to dig away the sand that had piled up beside the house, even little Emmy got in on it, using her hands. Angel and Cindy checked to see if anything was damaged inside, including up in the attic. Luckily, nothing was badly mangled by the storm, but it seemed that the roof's interior may need a patch up. \"Angel!\" Mok called out to his wife, \"Davey is here!\" \"What? I don't believe it,\" she replied and went back outside, where she met with her boss, Captain David 'Davey' Biggins. \"Davey, what brings you here?\" Angel asked. \"You're not going to believe this, but we got a triple homicide by the old dock,\" he replied and Angel's eyes grew wide. \"Are you sure?\" she asked, again. \"I am pretty sure. At first, I thought they were hit by lightning, but Hannah found gun-shot wounds on the back of the woman's head and more gun-shot wounds on the two kids' backs,\" Davey explained and Angel gasped when she heard that two children were the victims. \"Do you believe they are related to the woman?\" she asked. \"I do, they do share the same features. Hannah has them at the morgue now and Killigan and Rister are looking for anyone who knows the three of them,\" Davey replied and Angel began to think. \"Do you think they were homeless?\" she asked, but Davey shook his head. \"They didn't look that way, they were wearing nice clothes, not the kind you would see on homeless people,\" he replied and adds, \"Anyway, I wanted to ask you if you can come and work on this case.\" \"Davey, look around,\" Angel said and her boss did look around, \"I can't abandon my family and my employees and let them do all the work.\" \"Angel, you're not the only one who is up to her eyeballs in work, and you're the best officer in the force,\" Davey replied, \"Listen, I'm needed in the rescue and recovery relief, so I really need you on this case, please?\" he begged. Angel looked back at her family and the employees, who were still digging away at the sand. Mok seemed to notice the look on his wife's face and joins her. \"Angel, what is the matter?\" he asked. \"We got a triple homicide and Davey here needs every able bodied officer to take this case, but since everyone is out working in the recovery relief, I'm the only one available,\" she replied. Mok placed a hand on her shoulder. \"Then go, we'll be fine,\" he said. Angel looked at their daughter, who was using a sand bucket to transport some sand to the beach, with Cindy watching her. \"Alright,\" Angel replied and went inside the house to retrieve her badge, gun, and forensic kit. \"Mommy,\" Emmy said as soon as Angel stepped out, \"Are you going to work?\" \"I'm afraid so sweetie, but I should be back by this evening,\" she replied and kissed her daughter's forehead, \"I love you,\" she added. \"Love you, too, mommy,\" Emmy said and Angel joined with Davey and they drove away to the crime scene.[Chapter 5] Chapter 4 During the drive, Angel got to see the destruction left by the storm. Trees had been uprooted, most of them struck power lines or landed on houses or cars. Electric companies were out and about, working on the down power lines. Most of the people were hard at work removing the heavy trees, including the branches off of their lawns. Davey and Angel arrived at the scene; it was close to the run-down, abandoned pier and dock in the shady part of town. The houses that were close to the pier were in need of good repair, not due to the storm, but perhaps from years of humidity and other sorts. Angel walked into the crime scene and began to look around. Outlines of the victims had been made of white tape, but Angel was stumped when she saw that the third body did not leave any blood. \"I suspect the woman was already dead and, if the other two were her children, they died here,\" Angel said as she looked over the other two and took pictures of them. \"Did you look for any weapons along the premises?\" she asked Davey. \"We did, but nothing,\" he replied, although Angel found that hard to believe. She moved out from behind the police tape and began to look for herself. Her guts told her to check the pier and she walked over to what was left of it. Most of it had been washed away in the storm, as some wooden beams and boards were floating out in the open ocean. Angel looked around in the water, but due to the muck, it was impossible to see anything. She was about to leave, when the sun, its rays piercing through the clouds, shown on the water, and Angel saw something shine. \"Davey,\" she called and walked up to him, \"I need some scuba gear.\" \"What for?\" her boss asked. \"It's a hunch and I just hope I'm right,\" she replied and Davey ordered for some scuba gear to be brought for Angel. After changing into a wet suit with goggles and armed with an oxygen tank, Angel went into the water, praying that the sun would still shine its rays on the object. She located the source and picked it up; it was a pistol and she returned to the shore. \"What did you find?\" Davey asked when Angel broke the surface. She held up the pistol and replies, \"It could be the murder weapon.\" \"I wish I follow my guts, but I don't have the gut to do it,\" Davey said. The pistol was bagged as evidence and Angel changed out of the scuba gear. \"I need a ride to the morgue,\" she said, she was eager to hear what her friend, Dr. Hannah Gideon had to say about the victims. ()()()()()()()()()() Angel was brought to the Mystic Rock Harbor's PD morgue. Luckily, it survived the ragging storm last night, although was sure that Hannah had her work cut out due to the fatalities from the storm. She placed a lab robe over her clothes as she entered in the morgue. That was when she heard the humming of a generator. \"Sorry Angel, I need electricity to do my work and to keep the corpses cold. With the town out of power, there was no other way,\" Hannah said to her. \"It's okay,\" Angel replied, \"Anyway, did you have time to look over the three victims that were said to be murdered?\" she asked. \"Yup and they were murdered by the way,\" Hannah answered and featured the three victims there were displayed on the tables. \"Did you find any ID on any of them?\" Hannah asked. \"No, not yet,\" Angel replied and looked at the woman dog and saw a bullet wound to the forehead. \"Was she shot first?\" she asked. \"I believe so, her wound is different from the kids, as both of them were shot in the back,\" Hannah answered, \"Death was instantaneous for the three of them, but I believe they did not suffer for too long,\" she added. Angel looked at the two children, they looked like teenagers, a boy and a girl. Ever since this pass summer, Angel always dreaded seeing a child at the morgue. \"They had their lives cut out before their time,\" she said and Hannah nodded. Then, Captain Davey came in and says, \"We got someone who might know the identities of these three victims, Mr. Alan Middleton.\" A middle aged male dog humanoid came in and stared at the three corpses. His eyes grew wide in shock and he backed into the wall. \"No, no, no,\" he said, covering his eyes. \"Mr. Middleton, do you know who they are?\" Davey asked. \"Yes,\" Mr. Middleton answered and began to sniff, \"My wife and kids, Helena, Kristen, and Lucas, or Luke as he...was called.\" \"Mr. Alan Middleton,\" Angel said, \"My name is Angel Lyons-Swagger, I'm a detective in forensics, I want to say I'm sorry for your loss. Let's go somewhere else and talk,\" she added and she and Davey led him out of the morgue. ()()()()()()()()() The station had no electricity, so another generator was being used, but it hummed very loudly. In the main lobby, Angel and Davey spoke to Alan Middleton. \"Do you know what happened last night? Do you know where your wife and children went before the storm?\" Angel asked. \"I got home early after finishing boarding up the auto-shop I worked at, because my wife and kids are terrified of storms. I wish they weren't so scared all the time, because it usually got out of control. \"Anyway, I'm came home, but Helena and the kids were not there, which surprised me because the kids were let out of school due the threat of the storm. I called on her cell, but no answer. I suspected that she took the kids to do some last-minute shopping before the worst was to come, but then, when the storm did come, they did not come back,\" Alan explained and continues. \"I thought maybe they took shelter at the grocery store, so I called the closet one, but I got an automatic message saying that the phone lines were temporarily out of service due to the storm. I was planning to ride up to the store, but they say it is not safe to ride during a storm.\" \"You were wise into not doing that,\" Davey said and asks, \"What did you do during the storm?\" \"I just waited and listened, hoping and wondering when they would walk through the door, but I fell asleep around midnight I guess because the next thing I knew, it was morning and a police officer was knocking at my door,\" Alan answered. \"Mr. Middleton, is there anyone who would have a grudge against you?\" Angel asked, but Alan looked confused and he shakes his head. \"Your wife and children were murdered. They might have been killed during the storm,\" Angel said and Alan's eyes grew wide in shock. \"Do you have any leads or clues?\" Alan asked. \"We can't share information with anyone outside of the force, but you will be the first to know who did it, that is when or if we catch them,\" Davey replied. \"Please do so and I will be forever grateful,\" Alan said and he left the station. \"Did he look sincere?\" Angel asked her boss. \"Let's not judge Mr. Middleton's feelings, he just lost his family,\" Davey replied. \"I'm just curious about what you thought of him,\" she said. \"You don't suspect he killed his wife and kids?\" Davey asked, hands on his hips. \"No, I just think he is hiding something,\" Angel replied. \"Detective Swagger, I suggest you begin working on who owns that gun and see if it was the murder weapon,\" the police captain ordered and Angel nods and starts working on her tasks. From the author: Liking it so far? There's more to come![Chapter 6] Chapter 5 No Internet access meant no speedy work for Angel as she mostly relied on the Internet for research, but she didn't need it right now. She had completed filling three crime reports on the family that had been murdered last night. Now came the hard part, she had to find where the gun came from and who owned it. Angel knew that guns had numbers on them and gun shop owners usually wrote down the numbers to identify the people who bought the weapons. She looked at the handle of the pistol and found the numbers and wrote them down. \"I'm going to check every gun shop in this town to see if one of them sold this gun,\" Angel said to her boss. \"Good luck with that because I think every shop would be boarded up still,\" Davey replied and Angel left the station. The clouds were still gray and the breeze smelled of the sea and sand. Angel took a walk around Mystic Rock Harbor and it was quite a sight. Utility workers were doing their best in repairing the power lines. Some of the telephone poles had collapsed onto building, but luckily the fuse boxes did not spark a fire. Roofs had been blown away, revealing the wooden structures underneath. Debris laid everywhere, trash, branches, and even sand from the beach littered the streets. \"Careful miss,\" someone in a utility uniform said and pointed to a down power line that sparked with electricity. Angel took extra caution in walking the streets and located the first gun shop. The owner was sweeping up debris on the sidewalk and Angel asked him if he sold any gun with the numbers she had written. The owner shook his head, \"Sorry, can't help you,\" he said, \"I went to electronics two years ago and I keep all my records on the computer. With the power out, I can't help you.\" That was the downside for Angel as most people in this town relied on electronics and with no power, they were helpless. Angel went to the next gun shop and the owner had the same excuse. She felt her luck was about to run out as there was a third shop in town, the last one. The owner, an elderly dog humanoid looked over the numbers and his face lit up. \"Let me get my book,\" he said and Angel's hopes went up. \"You don't have records on a computer?\" she asked, sounding excited. \"Don't like those electronic things and heck, I don't know how to use one,\" the owner replied and showed her inside. The owner pulled out a leather journal from behind the counter and opened it up to the recent sales. \"Yeah, I sold a pistol with those numbers to an Alan Middleton,\" the owner said and Angel was shocked when she heard the name. \"Alan Middleton?\" she repeated the name, baffled by this. \"Do you know what time it was when he came and bought the gun?\" she asked. \"It was before the storm, I say between 2 and 4 pm,\" the owner replied. \"Did he give an explanation as to why he wanted to buy the pistol?\" Angel asked, again. The owner began to think and answers, \"He said that there was some vermin he had to take care of or something like that.\" Angel usually jumped to conclusions and she thought that Mr. Middleton murdered his own family, but why? Angel thanked the gun shop owner and went back to the station. She informed her boss of what she found out. \"That's interesting,\" Davey said. \"I'm going to see Hannah and see if she pulled out any bullets from the bodies,\" Angel replied and went to the morgue. Angel entered inside the morgue where she could hear the humming of the generator and saw Hannah doing a report. \"Oh good, you're here,\" she said and motioned Angel to come near her. \"I pulled these out of the Middleton family,\" Hannah added, showing six bullets, they looked identical. \"I honestly wish the electricity would come back on, I don't know how long this generator will last,\" Hannah said and Angel had to agree. She needed to use a telescope to see if the bullets' numbers were identical to the ones Alan Middleton owned, but Angel had to retrieve them first. \"Thank you Hannah,\" she said to her friend and left the morgue and returned to her boss. Angel explained to Davey that she needed to see Alan Middleton and ask him if he owned the pistol and if he did, she wanted to see the bullets. \"Best of luck in finding a judge to sign a warrant, I can't reach any of them with the telephone lines down and my cell is dead,\" Davey said to her. \"Crap, mine is too,\" Angel replied after looking at her cell phone. \"Here,\" Davey said and began to write something on a piece of paper. He wrote some of the town's judges' addresses. \"Hope you can find one of them,\" he added and Angel thanked him and left the station.[Chapter 7] Chapter 6 Angel walked around the town, again, trying to locate any of the judges. She looked around the place, astonished by how much damage the storm left. Some of the streets had been clean of debris, but the utility workers were still trying their best to restore power to the town. Angel knew that it was going to take some time for that to happen. A gentle breeze blew in and the clouds were disappearing, revealing a wondrous blue sky. Angel located the first judge's home, but what she saw upset her. A tree had fallen on the house, it was completely leveled and firemen and paramedics were hard at work. \"Hey!\" Angel called and the firemen looked at her, \"Do you need any help looking for survivors?\" she asked. \"No ma'am, we found everyone, but I hate to say this, there were no survivors,\" one of them replied and Angel's stomach dropped. She looked around and saw two body bags on gurneys being loaded into the coroner's van. Angel quietly said her respects to the judge and whatever family he had with him during the storm. Angel left to find the next judge. To her relief, the judge's house was not destroyed, but she was informed by a maid that he left town to escape the storm. Angel had one more judge to find and she walked to his home. This time, the judge, Edmond Harris was home at work in cleaning up his yard with his children. \"Your honor,\" Angel said and Harris turned to face her. Judge Harris was a rat humanoid with dirty blonde hair and green eyes. \"Detective Swagger, what brings you here?\" Harris asked. \"I need you to sign a warrant, there was a triple homicide last night and we have a suspect,\" Angel explained and Harris seemed interested in the story. Angel explained about the murders, the pistol, and the suspect, Alan Middleton. \"A guy kills his own family?\" Harris asked, \"But why?\" \"I don't know, that's what I intend to find out,\" Angel replied and adds, \"I need to search Middleton's property to see if he is hiding anything.\" \"Well, you are in luck, as I keep some printed warrants in my office here,\" Harris said and leads her inside. The judge's house survived the brunt of the storm and Angel wondered how it did. \"This whole town is in turmoil, all because of one big storm, and they feel it's the end of the world to them,\" Judge Harris said as they entered his office. It was full of shelves with tons of books and a desk with papers and pens. \"Now I did hear that you found a pistol at the crime scene, did you find out who owned it?\" the judge asked, pulling out a warrant. Angel answers, \"Yes, Alan Middleton, the gun shop owner confirmed it.\" The judge nods and fills out the warrant, even signing it and hands it to Angel. \"You best be careful, as I said, the whole town is in turmoil, it might take weeks for everything to get back together,\" Harris said to her. Angel thanked him, taking the warrant, and leaves the house. \"Good luck in the cleanup,\" she said and he chuckles. Angel walked around the town, it looked the same as before, but there were Red Cross tents set up. People were being treated for injuries or were offered food. Angel knew that these people were homeless or their homes survived, but they were in need of repair. Just then, someone shouts, \"Help! Thief!\" Out of the blue, Angel saw a young cat humanoid running from Red Cross nurses and she followed suit. She was quick on her and tackled the thief to the ground. \"Get off me, bitch!\" the cat shouted, flailing his legs under Angel's weight. The nurses and some other people came in to help and pull the thief up to his feet. Angel checked the cat and found a bag of bottles of morphine and syringes. \"Why did you steal these?\" she demanded, although she suspected that he was addicted to the drug. \"They're for my cousin, he's hurt,\" the cat answered rather quickly. \"Oh c'mon, you have to get up early in the morning to think of an answer like that,\" Angel replied, just as a police officer came in and handcuffed the thief and took him to a waiting squad car. \"Detective Swagger,\" the officer said, \"The captain wishes to see you,\" he adds and she gets in front seat of the car and they, with the thief head to the station. Upon arrival, the officer took the cat humanoid thief to booking, but Angel heard the agent say, \"We can't take him to a cell, it's crowded.\" \"What do you suggest?\" the officer asked. \"Handcuff him there,\" the booking agent answered, pointing to a steel rail beside a bench. The officer obeyed and left the cat there. Angel went to look for her boss and found him in his office. \"Angel, this whole town-\" \"Has gone to hell?\" she filled in for him and Davey nods. \"I have everyone, even the fire department out on the field, and I think you should do portal. That means there will be a curfew at 11 pm and no one is allowed to be out at that time,\" Davey explained. Angel was surprised, she was not expecting her boss to put her on portal duty. \"But what about the Middleton case? I've got a warrant to search the property,\" she pointed out and showed the signed warrant. Davey looked it over, nodding and replies, \"Will you need anything?\" \"I will be looking for blood, my theory is that the woman was killed in the house and the children died while outside at the scene,\" Angel said and Davey nods, again. \"I'll let you take Officer Hawkins, he could use some air, and before I forget,\" he replied and adds, \"There is a rainstorm coming tonight, not like the one we had last night.\" \"Wonderful,\" Angel said in a sarcastic tone and leaves the office. She collected her forensics kit and Officer Hawkins lead her out the door.[Chapter 8] Chapter 7 Angel and Officer Hawkins drove to the Middleton house just before mid-afternoon. It was still chaotic in the town, but it seemed that the electric companies were on a roll as parts of the town were being restored to power. Trees and debris were removed from the streets thanks to several volunteers, including Mayor Giroux. Angel decided not to talk to him as she was not sure how he would react to the triple homicide that occurred during the storm. Angel saw a few people walking the streets, some had stopped to stare at the waves that were crashing on the beach at the left side. Angel stared at the waves, too, mesmerized at their strength as they pounded at the sand. Then, she spotted three familiar people, her husband, daughter, and Cindy, staring out at the beach. \"Hawkins, stop the car,\" Angel ordered and he stopped and she got out. \"Mommy!\" Emmy exclaimed and Mok and Cindy turned to see Angel rushing up to them. Emmy ran into her mother's arms and Angel hoisted her up to her shoulders. \"What are you doing out here?\" she asked as Mok kissed her cheek. \"The little lady wanted to go for a walk and boy, we've seen a lot of things going on,\" Cindy answered. \"I bet you've heard this a lot already,\" Mok said, \"This whole town has gone hectic.\" \"Yes, I know and I've seen it, too. I arrested a thief who was trying to steal some morphine from the Red Cross,\" Angel answered, \"Plus, one of the judges and his wife were killed during the storm, a tree fell on their house.\" \"Geez,\" Cindy said under her breath. \"What are you doing now?\" Mok asked. \"I am this close in solving the triple homicide,\" Angel answered, using her fingers to show how much she was referring. \"That much?\" he asked, again, and she nods, \"And you did that without Internet?\" \"It was a pain walking around, but I did it,\" Angel answered, setting Emmy down and that's when she noticed that her daughter's hair was in two pigtails. \"Who did this?\" Angel asked, showing the braids. \"Cindy, but I helped,\" Emmy answered. \"You look cute in pigtails,\" her mother replied and remembered that she left Officer Hawkins in the squad car. \"Listen, I have to get back to work, I should be home this evening,\" Angel added. She asked for a kiss from Emmy, who kissed her on the cheek. Angel then looks at Mok, they shared a kiss, \"I love you, so much Angel,\" he said. \"I love you, too,\" Angel replied and turns to leave, but waves at them and she heads back to the squad car and it drove away. ()()()()()()()()()() Angel and Hawkins arrived at the Middleton house, it did not suffer much from the storm, but there were sticks and leaves scattered about. Angel took her forensics kit and walked up to the door and knocked. Alan Middleton answered, he looked as if he took a nap. \"Detective Swagger, what are you doing here?\" he asked, Angel could sense he was surprised. She then smelled some lemon scented cleaning chemical, but it wasn't bleach. \"I'm sorry to barge in, but I have a warrant to search the house,\" Angel answered, holding out the slip of paper. \"Can't you do it another time? I'm in mourning, I just lost my whole family,\" Alan Middleton said, but Angel did not buy it. \"Really? Do you clean while you mourn?\" she asked and saw that Alan's face had changed. He let them in, Angel handed the warrant to him, and she went into the front room. The lemon scent was strong in this room and saw a wet spot on the carpet. \"Did you wash up here just now?\" Angel asked Alan. \"Yes, I had a leak from the ceiling,\" he said, but Angel did not see any water dripping from the ceiling and there was no evidence of any water on the ceiling. Angel opened her kit, taking out some luminol, a chemical that can detect blood. She sprayed it over the spot and in an instant, it glowed. She took a cotton swap, dipped it in the spot and tested it to see if it was humanoid or animal. The test featured it was humanoid. \"Mr. Middleton, did something happen here just recently?\" Angel asked the dog humanoid and she saw that he was shaking. \"Uh, my nose started bleeding before you arrived,\" he answered, but she didn't buy it. \"Is that so?\" she asked and adds, \"Do you own a gun?\" \"No,\" he simple answered. \"I beg to differ,\" Angel said and explains, \"I went to one of the gun shops and the owner confirmed the numbers to the gun I found on the pistol I found. He said you bought it before the storm.\" Alan did not speak and Angel continued her explanation. \"Here's what I think happened; your wife and children were actually here with you and you shot your wife first and then, you had your children walk out in the storm. They were terrified as you ordered them to walk to the old dock and they had no idea what you planned to do,\" she said. Alan's face featured a frown and Angel continues, \"You carried your wife out of this house to the dock and there you shot your children. Why Mr. Middleton? What did they ever do to you?\" \"Because they did not know how to keep it together,\" he said, featuring no remorse. Angel just stared at him, but she understood what he meant when he said that. \"They couldn't keep calm during the storm?\" she asked and he nods. \"Every time it is the same, the shouting to the sky, the whimpering, the shaking, everything! They were grown ups, but they acted like little kids!\" Alan shouted and asks, \"Do you have kids?\" \"A daughter, she's three,\" Angel answered, angrily. \"Oh, so that's different, a little baby can get terrified of storms, but grown kids should know how to keep it together,\" Alan said in a dangerous low whisper. \"They were your children,\" Angel replied, bitterly angry, \"A father like you is suppose to protect them from all dangers, even from the forces of nature.\" \"Well, I did my part in protecting them,\" the killer said, still unmoved by what Angel said. \"No, you had failed in every possible way,\" she replied, her anger towards him was at its point. Angel turned to Hawkins, who handcuffed Alan Middleton and read his Miranda rights and lead him out of the house. ()()()()()()()()()()() At the station, Alan Middleton was booked in and put in a prison transport car as the station's cell rooms were full. \"Now why would a family man kill his own?\" Davey asked Angel. \"I don't know, but he blew a fuse when his family pushed him, in a mental way,\" she answered as she filled out her report on paper. The generators were still going, even when it got dark outside and the rain came, again and so did the thunder. The good thing was that there was no wind or lightning strikes, but the electric companies decided to stop for the day and wait to return to work. \"Angel,\" a female voice said and she saw her friend, Dr. Hannah Gideon. \"I located the Middletons next of kin, Helena's mother. I'll be releasing the bodies tomorrow,\" she said and Angel. \"How did she react when you told her?\" Angel asked. \"Like any mother who lost her child and grandchildren to a menace. She did say that she wants her son-in-law to get the needle,\" Hannah replied and saw that Angel was almost done with her work. \"Do you want me to drive you home?\" Hannah asked, again, and Angel nods as she did not drive to work today. \"Give me a few seconds and I'll be finished,\" she said and continued with her paper work. Hannah sat down and watched Angel write down the last few words. \"How could one storm trigger such a tragedy like this?\" Hannah asked and Angel thought of it. \"Don't know, I guess it is in our nature to panic and then move on, that is, if we live to see another day,\" Angel answered and turned in her work to her boss. She gathered up her things and went with Hannah. During the drive, some parts of Mystic Rock Harbor were still in total darkness and traffic officers were directing the flow of cars at the intersections. Angel saw that some of the places that did have electricity were filled with people grabbing a bite to eat or buying whatever was left in the stores. She saw that her neighborhood was still in darkness and she noticed someone holding a flashlight at the end of her driveway. It was Cindy, wearing a rain poncho and holding up a flashlight. Angel thanked Hannah for the ride and went in the house with Cindy. Cindy lead her up the stairs and into the living room, where it was lit with candles. Mok was sitting at a chair with a glass of wine and he noticed Angel. \"Where's Emmy?\" she asked in a whisper and Mok gave her a glass and filled it up. \"Asleep, she said the rain will go away when she wakes up in the morning,\" he answered and Angel took a drink. She saw that the wooden boards were down and they watch the flashing of lightning and the booming thunder. \"Mok, you want to hear what the triple homicide was like?\" she asked her husband. \"I do want to hear how it ended,\" he said, taking another sip. Angel told him the whole story of the Middleton family and of Alan's actions. \"Damn, why would he kill them like that?\" Mok asked. \"He couldn't handle it, mentally,\" Angel answered. \"Mental,\" he repeated and drank the rest of his wine, \"There's always something mentally wrong with everyone in this town,\" he added and Angel rests her head on his shoulder. They listened to the rain outside, it was light and gentle, unlike last night. \"In another five years, Mystic Rock will be battling another typhoon-like storm,\" Mok said and Angel finished her wine. \"Angel, I've been thinking,\" he adds and she looks at her husband. \"What would you say if we had another?\" he asked, but Angel gave a questionable look. It then hit her after a minute, \"Another baby?\" she asked and he nods. \"Mok, Emmy is not even four yet and it would be a hand-full with another.\" \"Who gives a damn?\" he asked and adds, \"I want to live my life the way you and I committed to and I bet Omar did not-\" \"Don't you dare say his name!\" Angel snapped at Mok. Whenever she heard her abusive boyfriend's name, it would send shivers down her spine. \"I'm sorry,\" Mok replied and holds her tight, \"I just think that he would never let you live long enough to see yourself exceed in whatever you wanted to do.\" \"I know,\" she said and decided to think. After a few minutes, she had her decision, \"Alright, we'll have another baby, but if the work load causes a mental strain on both of us, don't blame me.\" \"I would never be like that, I think about you and Emmy every day and I will most definitely-\" Angel stopped Mok from talking anymore by kissing him. \"Don't make a sound,\" she said as they reached their bedroom and quietly shuts the door.[Chapter 9] Epilogue The rain stopped falling around early morning and the clouds disappeared as the sun's rays filled the sky. In their bedroom, Angel and Mok were the first to see the sun for the first time in two days. \"It's quite amazing how a cloudy day can make us miserable and a sunny day can enlighten us,\" the retired rock star said. Angel kissed his cheek and thought about last night as it was first time in three years they had loving sex. Of course, they had to keep quiet so that Emmy would not hear them. \"Angel, about yesterday,\" Mok said to his wife. \"Emmy and I weren't just walking around to see the sights. I went shopping for pencils, paints and a canvas,\" he explained. Angel looked at him with a quizzical look. \"Are you starting a new hobby?\" she asked and he shakes his head. \"Painting was my hobby before I met you, I just hope I still it in me,\" Mok replied and adds, \"This is what I'll paint next, this scenery right here.\" Angel leans her head on his shoulder, \"I have the utmost confidence in you,\" she said and got ready to go to work. ()()()()()()()()() Angel was grateful to see that the electricity had come back on and that meant no humming generators. It also meant that the Internet was back on and Angel got right to work. She wrote up about the closing of the Middleton case. She received information that Alan Middleton was charged with first degree murder, but he had pleaded not guilty. Angel brought up about his confession in his house, but Alan stated that he was under pressure and he had to say something. The judge found it hard to believe and declared that Alan Middleton was guilty of the murders of his wife and children. He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. \"You were good out there Angel,\" Davey Biggins said to her. As a reward, Angel was treated to strawberry daiquiris and steak. Upon her return home, Angel saw that there was a half-finished canvas in the bedroom. It was of the sunrise outside of the porch and Angel loved it. \"You were not suppose to see that,\" a voice said from behind her. Angel turned to see her husband with a smile on his face. \"Sorry, but it looks good so far,\" she replied and Mok chuckles. \"So is the Middleton case closed?\" he asked, taking his canvas indoors. Angel explained the judge's sentence on Alan. \"Good, I hate to see him walk free,\"Mok said. \"No criminal walks free in this town, not while I'm here,\" Angel replied and Mok kisses her forehead. \"C'mon, first night with the electricity back on is a celebration to me,\" he said and they went to the living room to spend time with Emmy.

Prologue Mystic R"},{"Movie":"Someone Like You","Title":"Endless Love 2:Love Conquers All","Author":"eulyn jill","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4554423","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The name and charactheristic of the cast are just borrowed and not the same in real life... The story is just a product of my imagination... After their marriage, Chun and Ella expected that they will be able to live happily together... but they lived a complicated life instead. It's all because Chun's stepmother wasn't happy about Ella being his wife. She promised to herself to do anything to break their relationship. So, she made a step by criticizing Ella. She used to tell Chun that Ella didn't care for their daughter because she had a lover. At first, Chun didn't believe her. One day, Chun came home late but he noticed that Chunella was not feeling well... When he found out that Chunella had a fever, he looked for Ella because he didn't know how to take care of a child. He looked after her around the house then he realized that Ella was not there. He asked his stepmother and both had a conversation. \"Do you know why Chunella used to get sick almost every month? Well, it's all because your beloved wife has no time to take good care of her... And it's all because Ella used to spend more time with her lover rather than with you or your daughter.\" \"What? Ella has a lover? No, I don't believe you because I know that she is not that kind of girl.\" \"Are you sure? You're not always by her side so she has a chance to make love with another guy. Why don't you try to observe her?\" When Chunella was already asleep, Ella arrived. Because she was too tired... she instantly fell asleep after she has changed her clothes. Chun noticed that Ella didn't even check their daughter's condition. So, he remembered what his stepmother told him awhile ago. Before he went to bed, he smelled Ella's shirt and he was so surprised because it had a scent of a man's perfume. The next day, Ella came home more late than she did last night. And Chun was pushed to confront her about his bad instinct. \"Ella, please be honest, are you having an affair with another guy? \"What kind of question is that? How can I have an affair with another guy if I can't even bear my obligation as a wife and as a mom?\" she instantly answered. \"Then why you don't have time to take good care of our daughter? Last night, you didn't even find out that she had a fever,\" Chun insisted. \"Now I know that you don't really love me and you were just forced to marry me because of Chunella... and one more thing... you don't trust me even just for being the mother of your daughter,\" Ella angrily said.[Chapter 2] After saying those words, she ran away from their house and went to Hebe's house After saying thosenwords, she ran away from their house and went to Hebe's house. \"Ella, itnis already late... why are you still not home? Come in,\" Hebensurprisingly said. \"Chun and Inhad an argument a while ago... can I stay here for tonight?\"nElla directly said. Hebe hold hernhands and answered: \"Oh... sure anytime. I'm your friend right?nSo I am always willing to help you... Always remember that!\" Ella hugged hernand said: \"Thanks Hebe.\" \"You arenalways welcome my dearest friend,\" Hebe answered. Meanwhile,nCalvin and Angela decided to move to Australia because Angela wantednto be in her hometown before she gave birth to their first baby. Thennext day, Ella decided to stay at the hotel rather than to stay atnHebe's house and because she didn't come home for almost two nights,nChun's stepmother found the oppurtunity to destroy Chun's goodnimpression on Ella. She hoped it would be even worse than before...[Chapter 3] \"See, she doesn't even care to come home even just for Chunella \"See, she doesn'tneven care to come home even just for Chunella... for sure she is withnher lover,\" Chun's stepmother told Chun. Chun stood upnand said: \"So much for that topic.\" But the truthnwas that he was affected by the issue... and he wanted to let Ellancome home so that they can live peacefully together as a happy familynbut his pride pushed him not to beg his wife to come back. Afternthree days, Ella missed her daughter so much so she decided to comenhome but before, she dropped by Hebe's house to give her birthdayngift to Arobe (Hebe's daughter). Hebe was not at her house that timenbecause she was in America for her business tour... Aaron was the onenwho opened the door for Ella. When Chun who was secretly followingnher saw the scene, he misinterpreted it and thought that Aaron andnElla were having a secret relationship. And because he felt jealous,nhe hurriedly left... After Ella finally gave her gift for Arobe, shenrealized that she wasn't able to go home because Chun's stepmothernwill surely insult her as she arrived. So, Elle came up with the ideanto prepare her daughter's passport so that they can go back innAmerica where her parents lived. Meanwhile, Chunnwas so depressed that time so he kept himself busy until he got sicknbecause of too much pressure. In the other hand, Ella finallynfinished fixing Chunella's document so she went to Chun's house tonpick up her daugther. As she entered the house, Chun's stepmothernlooked at her and said: \"What kind of wife are you? Your husbandnand daughter were both sick but you prefer to be with your lovernrather than your own family. And how dare you to come in?! You arennot welcome in this house... Crazy bitch!!\" Ella justnremained silent and directly went to their room then instantly packednup her things. She also packed up Chunella's clothes because she willnbring her daughter in America. When she and her daughter were aboutnto leave... Chun's stepmother stopped them and took Chunella awaynfrom Ella and said: \"You are not allowed to bring Chun'sndaughter outside of this house.\" \"What didnyou say? She's my daughter so I have all the rights to bring hernanywhere and anytime I want,\" Ella answered angrily. \"I'm sorrynto tell you but you don't deserve to be her mom. If you want to leaventhen go... but let Chunella stay at her father's house,\" Chun'snstepmother insisted[Chapter 4] Ella had no choice but to leave the house alone Ella had no choice butnto leave the house alone. She went to Selina's house to ask somenfavor. \"I'mnleaving tomorrow... I want to go back in America and I will just waitnthere for our divorce... maybe at that time he won't file a divorcenyet but I know he will because Chun doesn't love me anymore,\"nElla directly said. \"How cannyou say that...? I know Chun is in love with you. Okay, just think ofnit... Is he going to marry you if he doesn't really love you? \"Selinantried to comfort her. \"He wasnforced to marry me only because of Chunella. He doesn't trust evennjust for being the mother of my daughter,\" Ella tried to insistnher point of view. \"Okay, Ingot your point. But please listen to me. If you leave, Chun willnthink that his stepmother is saying the truth,\" Selina told her. \"So, whatnshould I do?\" Ella asked her. Selina sat atnher side and said: \"I guess it would be better if you justnstayed at my rest house until Chun is ready to accept you again.\" The next day,nHebe finally arrived from Australia. Because she didn't have any ideanof what was happening in Taiwan while she was on her bussiness trip,nshe instantly believed the rumor about Ella and Aaron's secretnrelationship and it caused her to be angry at Aaron and Ella. Shenwent to Selina's house to tell her feelings about the issue. \"No, that'snnot true. Chun's stepmother is the one who started the issue so thatnChun would leave Ella. Don't you remember that she didn't like Ellanas her daughter-in-law from the start?\" Selina tried to clear upnher mind. \"I can'tnbelieve it! You are my best friend but you choose Ella rather thannme?\" Hebe sadly said. \"Yeah,nyou're right. I'm your best friend... then why you don't believe me?\"nSelina hurriedly answered. Because Hebenmisinterpreted Selina's point of view, they had a conflict in theirnfriendship. Meanwhile, Chun started to realize that it was impossiblenfor Ella to find another guy because Ella loved their daughter. So,nhe decided to find her. He called Selina and asked about Ella'snlocation. And of course Selina told him the truth and told him thenplace where Ella was currently living. As for Ella, shenhad no idea about her pregnancy so she just kept on doing some hardnwork like laundry. Because she did too much effort, she lost thenbaby. While Chun was on his way to Selina's rest house, a very strongnrain falls... When he arrived there, he saw Ella lying on the groundnwith blood on her legs.[Chapter 5] Chun hurriedly went out of his car and came near to Ella Chun hurriedly went outnof his car and came near to Ella. He instantly brought her to thenhospital. When they were already there, they found out that they hadnlost their baby. He blamed himself for this issue. While his dadndecided to file a divorce with his stepmother, Chun knew that it wasnhis stepmother's fault. When Chun's dad arrived at the hospital, theyntalked about a lot of things. \"It is allnmy fault... if I just believed and trusted her this wouldn'tnhappen... maybe we didn't lost our baby yet,\" Chun desperatelynsaid. \"Don'tnblame yourself, son. It's not your fault... don't be so down andndepressed! Be strong and always remember that everything happens forna reason. Why don't you help Ella to move on?\" his dad told him. Hebe realizednthat Ella was innocent about the rumor that she heard and so she justnforgot that matter and visited Ella at the hospital. There, she sawnSelina and she tried to apologize and of course Selina accepted hernapology. When Ella finally recovered from her sickness, Chun went tonher side and asked for her forgiveness. Because she loved him and fornthe sake of their daughter, she instantly forgave him and went backnto their house. And finally, they lived happily together as a onenhappy family.

The sto"},{"Movie":"Boat That Rocked","Title":"You're Listening To","Author":"White Wisps of Smoke","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7097588","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: Radio Rock I took a drag from the cigarette dangling on my mouth and pulled it away to blow smoke into the air, letting it snake around my set. \"And that was the exuberant sounds from the Who. Next up we have the Kinks, don't turn that dial.\" I let my voice trail off and turned off my mike and leaned back in my lovely swivel chair to face the glass. \"What?\" I asked through the glass. It was the captain, so to speak, standing on the other side and she was always keeping an eye out on our ship. \"Meh, do you always have to smoke while you broadcast? You're gonna blacken your lungs with that crap.\" Her voice was muffled, but I could hear her well enough. \"You chew it, so I don't see the problem.\" I said loud enough for her to hear me through the glass. The woman, Jackie, spit the tobacco classily into the nearest trashcan and said, \"I'm quitting.\" I snorted and went back to shuffling through the music I picked for the next hour. Lacy was on after me. After my last hour was up, I handed off to my co-worker, but sat back to watch her nonetheless. I liked how she upped the ante with her bouncing-off-the-walls personality. \"Thank you Meryl, and welcome, Britain, to Lacy's two hours of nonstop excitement!\" Her wording was funny, but that was likely because I wouldn't do anything like her. Lacy's voice was bright and ecstatic, probably a hundred times livelier than me. I got up to leave, giving Lacy the thumbs up before heading to the kitchen. \"Hello, Rochelle, what's for dinner tonight?\" I asked, yawning. Rochelle was our petite cook, who could cook a mean steak. \"We've got chicken salad.\" She said in her cockney accent. \"Again? That's the third time this week.\" I muttered. \"I can't just let you all get fat. You can't exactly run a mile on this ship.\" I sat at the four-seater dining table and regrettably munched on the vegetables that Rochelle had placed for snack. After I had almost enough, I stood with forcefulness. \"Fuck this, I'm finding Thelma.\" Thelma, I guess it was unfair to call her fat, since the rest of us weren't fat, but weren't muscled from exercise either, so its that nonsense of the pot calling the kettle black; she just happened to have the worst metabolism, and a soft spot for chocolate. Which was why I was finding her. Without knocking on her cabin door, I barged in on her reading a magazine while painting her nails red. She really wasn't fat, she just had a more voluptuous form. \"Alright, where's the stash?\" Without looking up, she nodded her head to the top bunk. Under the pillows. I grabbed the large chest nestling there in all its glory, and picked a nice Mars bar. \"You lot will be helping me replace the candy bar collection the next time we make port.\" She asserted, and kept to her business. I suppose we should explain ourselves. We are Pop Wave. Yes, yes, you might say we're a knock-off Radio Rock, but you might find yourselves with a crew full of angry women, waiting to prove that they weren't dainty women. There was Lacy, Rochelle, Jackie, Gertrude, Kelly, Molly, Frankie, Justice, Harper, and of course, me. All of us held a shift at Pop Wave, except Jackie and Rochelle, who were the captain and the cook. My shift being the late afternoon to evening shift, and then sometimes filling in at one in the morning if one of the others were too smashed. Lacy preferred the upbeat pop songs, mostly the up to date on catchy pop. Jackie kept track of ratings. Gertrude was an old soul, and played a lot of fifties and earlier tunes. Kelly liked to keep it strictly R&B; soulful with the temptations and Chuck Berry. Molly had an odd attachment to Elvis. Frankie liked a little country. Justice held female singers in her high-books, so please don't preach her about the power of women. Harper liked to dick around with music from every era. And me? Well you could say if rock had a human body, well… don't let me catch it. Stones, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Animals, fuck. Yeah, once the girls found out rock and roll was my thing, they welcomed me aboard. Instantaneously, I can recall first and foremost our conversations were about music. Then they digressed when we realized we didn't know much about each other. And so we were friends. We lived on a boat in the northern sea. Right, well Rock Wave did once broadcast from a studio, but once the government caught wind of the girls in the crew at the time, that ship set sail. Pardon that terrible pun. I used to go to a private school. Then to a public school. Then my marks were so low, my parents could hardly stand to see me lurking around the house. I was a smoker, probably somewhere along the lines I used drugs (I say probably because those memories seem to blur), I drank a little. Oh, and I once told the headmistress she'd probably get laid more often if she trimmed the box once in a while. Down there . Almost needless to say, I was kicked out. I heard about a job opening as a DJ here at Pop Wave, and only made the cut because I said I would work for minimum and lied and said I was eighteen. Having hips ahead of my peers, I suppose, got me on this boat. I'm seventeen, turning eighteen this summer. I accidentally let slip once earlier this week that I was only seventeen, and Jackie almost flipped her shit, but everyone convinced her I only had a bit to go. Plus I was holding my own for ratings. The next day, after my shift, it was a rainy Friday, and Jackie had us all gathered around for our biweekly ratings. She handed us all a chart, and I looked at mine, inhaling the smoke from my cigarette. My jaw instantly dropped, just as my ratings. \"What the fuck is this?\" I murmured, but knew it was loud for all to hear. The girls shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Everyone's ratings had gone just a touch down, save for my eyesore of a graph. \"Don't take it personally, Meryl, it's that station, Radio Rock, that's actually caused a drop in all our standings,\" Jackie said sceptically. \"We need to do something about this.\" Justice said. Huh, ironic. \"Well, I contacted our advertisers on land, and they said for extra mentioning they put up a few more flyers.\" Jackie said pathetically. \"You're joking right? A few flyers wouldn't be able to get us back up there.\" Lacy said, and put her arm around me supportively. I snuffed out my fag and adjusted my sunglasses from my forehead to their respective place on my face. \"I also contacted Quentin, from Radio Rock.\" Jackie said quickly. \"And?\" Molly asked, saying what we were all thinking. \"He's not taken kindly.\" She chuckled pensively. \"Well fuck me, I thought they'd graciously step down.\" I said sarcastically. Though I could tell any other time I'd get a nice chuckle in response, the air was far too tense for that kind of behaviour. There was a silence, and everyone sort of left the circle silently. \"Everyone prepare to make port tomorrow. We'll raise some hell next week.\" Jackie said loudly, trying to pump everyone back up. The following morning, when I was still grumpy, we made port. All day, at port taped shows we made would play. I was first off the boat, eager to do something to make me forget about my bad ratings. I'd find a bar, but what I really needed was to find a record shop. But before I could go my own way for a while, Jackie called us all on the dock. \"Everyone, don't get too smashed because the advertising companies want to meet with us later and discuss new techniques.\" \"Why do they want to see us? Isn't that part of your job?\" \"Well they feel that they want to know who they're dealing with.\" She said, and when no one objected, \"Everyone back at the dock by four, I'm driving you to the place, then we'll have supper.\" With my pay check, I went walking with Molly and Justice, who were both in their mid-twenties, around the stores close to the ship along the boardwalk to look at some new records and releases. \"Kid, don't let those ratings get you down. Your show is great.\" Molly said supportively from an aisle away in the oldies but goodies section. \"Yeah, you can't exactly help it, Radio Rock is one hell of a show.\" Justice said, holding up a Janice Joplin single. I know Justice was very frank most of the time, but she was also quite clever. And she would have a good feeling if I were offended. I huffed and swallowed a bit of pride and continued scanning through for some new Beatles. Molly was a year younger than Justice, but they were both equally bombshells. She had shaggy boy short hair and killer curves, and wore miniskirts and band t-shirts to show them off. Justice was more of a jeans girl and was taller with a more willowy frame, and usually wore an oversized t-shirt. \"Listen girls, I'm just going to head to the ship,\" I said, grabbing my purchases, which were hardly fitting where I was carrying them under my arm. \"Take care, Meryl.\" They said. I could tell they were shooting sympathetic looks after me, and I had to keep telling myself that my crew cared about me. I was scuffing my oxfords the whole way down to the dock, kind of brightening at the thought of having the whole boat alone to myself. Even our cook would be out, so no one would be there to reprimand me in their motherly fashion. I heard clanging, even from down on the dock. Maybe Jackie was back doing some cleaning or some other nonsense. I climbed up into the boat and called out, \"Jackie?\" There was no answer, but the clamouring did not cease. I went below deck and almost screamed at the mess. \"What the fuck is going on?\" \"Shit!\" a few of the masked men voiced. \"Someone get Mark!\" one of them shouted. Scattered amongst our ship were men, filing through our records and slashing them. \"You don't need this Mark fellow. All of you need to get the hell out of here before I… do something drastic.\" I can honestly say I got nothing. \"Right. Someone get some duct tape.\" A rather podgy man said, and three or four out of the twelve gathered around me. \"No, don't touch me.\" I snapped. The one who had reached retracted his hand and said, \"Sorry miss.\" \"No, Simon, hold her in place while we put her in the chair.\" The same podgy character said. \"Right, sorry.\" He sat me down, and I rolled my eyes and figured these fools were completely harmless. \"I will scream, you idiots, and someone will come.\" I said blandly. They had procured the tape and were wrapping me to the chair. \"Oh I'm not so sure about that. You see, your crew seem to be held up at a—what did we call it? Advertising meeting? Yes, that. They'll have to meet there, get stood up, and have to come all the way back here and find you tied up and us on our way back out to sea.\" An American man said. He was hardly disguised, and made distinguishing who these poorly disguised men were. I wondered how angry Jackie would be with me, for hardly giving a fight? After all I cared about this ship as much as anyone of the other girls, but she would be pissed if she knew I let them tie me up. \"I thought I'd recognized you lot. Fucking Radio Rock is standing on my ship.\" \"So the missus is a fan.\" \"Regrettably.\" I said, trying to stare them all down at once. \"Oi, who's the bird?\" A man asked. If I were standing, I would have fallen back into the seat I was sitting in. It was Gavin Kavanagh. \"Vandals don't do this! Get the hell off my ship!\" \"Don't make us sick Mark on you.\" From the antic voice, I could tell it was that oddball Angus. Or was it the 'nut'? From the legends I've heard about Mark, the damage is lasting. \"Please, I'd much rather have the doctor.\" I exhale noisily, making a point to sound bored. \"And point one goes to Dave!\" An excited voice came from a man behind me. Of course, it was Doctor Dave. \"You boys are a rather unusual bunch. Though I can't say I'm surprised.\" I made contempt clear in my voice. \"Someone shut the little bugger up.\" Gavin said, clearly offended by my earlier statement. \"Just stay the fuck away from my set.\" As soon as the words left my mouth I snapped it shut and leaned my head back in frustration. \"Someone find her set and bring her effects.\" Gavin said. I tried not to cringe when they broke my headphones in half, which I had personalized. I tried not to cringe when the Count horked in my mike muffler. But I was thrashing in my seat when they pulled out the singles. \"The missus is a little feisty.\" Someone commented, I was to angry to notice who. \"So who are you anyways?\" They must have taken a wild guess with the set. \"The box says property of Meryl. You're Meryl?\" \"So what?\" I asked. \"Well, we have to say you live up to your voice.\" At his words, I recoiled into my seat, but I nodded my head, \"I'm flattered, and I wish I could say the same.\" I cracked. \"Alright get the tape.\" Gavin said, annoyed. He personally placed piece of tape over my mouth, and I sighed. \"She's kind of adorable when her mouth is shut.\" He's lucky the tape is on. \"Which is just how we're going to leave your station. Quiet.\" The Count said. I sat for a couple more minutes while they all grouped together, and cheered for staying true to their word of obliterating our station. \"I hope to never see your face again.\" Gavin said, tipping his feathered hat. I stuck out my foot, catching him in between the legs, but cursed in my head as I only got the inner thigh. He fell back into a few of his mates and flipped me off. \"Let's just leave, Gav, don't bother.\" Simon said. I had to smile at their ridiculous painted faces once more before I saw them leave. Minutes passed. I moved my upper body so that the tape bunched around my shoulders. This couldn't be any easier to get out of. The tape became slack enough for me to lift it over my head. Idiots. I left the ship running, and jumped over the rail and landed hard on the dock. I cursed as I saw their ship already heading out of the port. I could see a few jump in their knickers as I made my appearance, but I could still hear faint laughter. All I could do was wait around until my colleagues showed up filing out of the van. I saw their jaws drop at the sight of the boat, which I thought was odd, since the damage was inside. I turned to see the side of it had spray painted on it \"Fuck Pop\". Oh. That's what they were looking at. \"Meryl, what the hell!\" Jackie shouted. I shrank back. I heard a nasty creak come from behind, making me shrink even further than I though possible. The ship must have sunk slowly about half its height, before a 'thunk' could be heard. Crap. The girls' faces ranged from surprise to anger. The next day after we were put up in a hotel thanks to Jackie, we were all down at the dock. We got some police divers to help get some salvaged stuff. We told them mainly to grab the records, since everything else would be damaged beyond repair. I still hadn't quite told them that Radio Rock had wrecked most of their things anyways. So when the divers pulled up box after box of records, I waited behind them, trying to be the least out of the way as possible. Despite that effort, Molly came to stand beside me. \"You should read this.\" She stated, handing me a paper, and crossed her arms, waiting to also get at the records. \" Sorry we couldn't make the meeting, better luck next time girls,\" I glanced further down the page, \" Just kidding, it's just us, your friends from Radio Rock, Ha ha. \" \"Wait, there's more.\" Molly added. I turned the page over, \" Ha ha. \" The letter was written poorly, with chicken scratch as an excuse for penmanship. \"Right, well, maybe taking a look at the records isn't such a good idea…\" I guess i'll give a better description of her next chapter for those of you who need a better visual.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer, I guess: I don't own anything having to do with TBTR… sadface. Also, fair warning about foul language lol Chapter 2: Business Purposes All the girls gave me hell. I didn't have the heart to tell them that my box of records was unharmed, since I hid mine in my room, and told a diver to grab those ones. We stood sulking in the cool breeze, still clueless of what to do now. \"Excuse me ladies,\" A voice said. \"Twat.\" I heard Rochelle say. I sniggered at that. I turned around and there was a man in a nice suit. \"Yes?\" Jackie said, coming to stand in front of the rest of us, to probably make it seem less like we were sizing him up. I have to admit we are a pretty intimidating crew. Not one of us is unfortunate looking. \"I'm assuming you ladies were the owners of the boat.\" \"I was the captain,\" Jackie said boldly, \"and who are you?\" She crossed her arms smartly, and squared her stance. \"I'm here on behalf of the Minister Dormandy. Are those divers police officers?\" He asked, trying to look past our body of people. \"Yes…\" She shooed us all out of the way and led the oddball to the edge of the dock. \"Right, men!\" he called behind himself and a few other officers came to his side, which had previously been helping us. \"Would you care to explain to me why you're helping these criminals?\" \"We were doing our civic duty sir. They've done nothing wrong.\" \"That's not the point. They're docked in London, so therefore they're breaking laws in London.\" \"Actually, we're currently off air.\" I piped in. He whipped his head around to see who had spoken, but gave up searching through our faces. \"Right, and we shall keep it that way.\" He said anyways. \"Call the divers up.\" \"We have to wait for them to resurface, sir.\" An officer said. The man huffed, and tapped his foot. When the three divers resurfaced with another load of our things, I went to help them by taking the boxes of stuff in their arms and handing it off to several of the other girls. \"You, girl, stop moving those boxes. They're hereby property of the government.\" \"Sir, don't you need a warrant?\" I asked nonchalantly, and bent down to pick up my box of music, which appeared safe and sound. He flared his nostrils. \"What did you say your name was, sir?\" I asked again. \"I told you, his name was Twatt.\" Rochelle said, stepping by my side. \"Rochelle?\" This Twatt fellow said, leaning in. \"It's been awhile.\" He seemed extra pleased to see her, I noticed as I stood beside them. Rochelle was a bit repulsed by him; any girl could see it. \"I see you're still twatty Twatt from school.\" Everyone was still giggling. He didn't seem to notice, or had gotten used to being made fun of in school. \"You shouldn't be affiliating yourself with these people and with this life. Its against the law.\" I saw him shoot a disgusted look at us. He then turned to Jackie, his manner still disgusted, \"So whose lovely work is this?\" \"Ah, that would be Radio Rock.\" She gazed out at sea, where long before the girls showed up, I watched them as they headed back out. \"I can't say I'm sorry for you,\" he continued a bit more quietly, \"however this does give me something to bring back to the Minister.\" He probably thought he was mumbling to himself, but he was speaking quite clearly. I opened my box full of records, and my eyes lit up in delight, as I realized it was left untouched, other than a bit of water damage to the bottom of the cases. I didn't notice how watertight this box would be before, but it certainly came in handy when a rogue crew came and ravaged your boat, wrecked your stuff and sank your boat. I chose not to tell the others that my box was safe and sound. I'd probably get chewed out. For the next couple of weeks, we all sort of went our separate ways. And regrettably, the only thing I could listen to was Radio Rock. Sunshine Radio, are you kidding? Anyways, I was sitting at home, at my father's house, since my parents were separated, and my mother was less agreeable about my leaving school. \"Hey Dad.\" I said out loud. \"How's mum?\" I was lying on the couch, while he was in the kitchen talking to his maid. She did everything for him. I can't say he'd be a very good cook. Or cleaner. Or anything for that matter, other than being very charming to his buyers. \"She's been asking about you.\" My dad was a real estate agent. He actually sold his own house that he owned with my mother, and helped her buy a new house, along with a new one of his own. I thought they were a little childish, despite them telling me. I couldn't argue that I wasn't childish, frankly because, well, look at the state of me. \"Yeah? Has she found a school that will take me?\" I asked bemusedly. \"I told her good luck with that months ago. Actually, no, she found out about your career taking an abrupt halt.\" \"I'm on temporary leave.\" \"Right. Anyways, she's trying to get you a job. She sent me this.\" He held in his hands a flyer. At first I wasn't interested, because I wasn't much up for applying to stuff in the paper, but something on the page caught my eye, a few articles under the few red pen circled job opportunities, in bold print letters read Radio Rock . Before I'd met those lads, I'd never had a qualm, maybe a slight sense of competition. Of course ever since the event a couple weeks ago, I've had this odd obsession with them. As previously mentioned, I even listen to them. On the newsletter, it stated a competition. You've got to be fucking kidding me. So of course it had something to do with applying to their radio station. The stakes were surprisingly simple. You had to listen for a bell that rang twice a day from seven til eight, and then state all the songs in the playlist until the second bell rang at the end of the week. And when the week was out, you had to send in your playlist with name and contact. I glanced at the start date, which was tomorrow, the Monday. \"Dad, I'm going for a ride, where are the keys?\" \"On the mantle, and for god's sake don't smoke inside the car; wait until you reach your destination. I've still got that new car smell.\" \"Bye.\" I was already running out the door. By the time the week was over, I had paid special attention to every show, listening to the bells every day. For some of the songs, I had to ask my dad what it was, since they were from a little farther back than my knowledge supplied. Since Jackie was still out looking for another boat to house us, she just gave me the contact information to help my plan instead. Only my two girlfriends Justice and Molly would accompany me, since the others either wouldn't listen to a sentence containing Radio Rock, or were attempting to find other jobs. I copied my list out twice and gave it to them to mail it to Radio Rock, so we could all go together. Oh, right, my plan. Well I guess you could say that's why some of the other girls were sceptical about joining in. You see, I didn't have a good one. Okay, I didn't have much of one at all. Originally I was thinking whatever would incapacitate Radio Rock whilst I was on it, I would try and accomplish. But as we sat here on the ferry with 197 other contest winners, I wasn't so sure what I was thinking. I went to the loo, steeping around numerous girls who were checking with each other to see if their make up looked good, and if their clothes were tight enough. When I got out, I momentarily forgot my sea legs, and stumbled into someone. \"Sorry.\" I grumbled, and picked myself up, conscious of my leather trousers being dirty. \"My bad.\" I looked up. How the hell did Twatt get on the boat? I suppose it must have something to do with the lack of creativity in the competition that made it so a monkey could win it, or at least all these pathetic-looking young women and Twatt. I probably could have been grouped in with them by looks. His eyes seemed to feel my oncoming question as he recognized where I came from too, \"Business purposes.\" \"You know, I think I like you, Twatt.\" I said. I knew he was here to try and shut down Radio Rock, or at least trying to. I'll stick to his side for the time being. I told Justice to keep Molly from ogling (she was a tad ditzy, only if the boy knew where to look) and keep tabs around the boat, and we would meet back up on deck at the end of the tour. The boat came into view on the horizon. It shouldn't take us longer than forty minutes to reach the bastards. Finally after a long wait, of me bouncing in my shoes, and gripping my sweater closer around me, we were boarding the famous Radio Rock. As I climbed on deck, I saw the figure of their manager dude. Everyone was on deck talking, screaming, and my ears were deafened, because they've been screaming every since we were almost a mile away. A man standing on the upper deck addressed the crowd energetically, \"Ladies and gentlemen welcome to our boat of bliss!\" The fans, if possible, became louder, and even girlier than before. My masculinity was compromised. That was a joke. Twatt probably didn't want me following him around for all the snooping he was doing, so I kept him in the corner of my eye for most of the tour. He always eyed everything suspiciously. Like the cookies they just baked in the kitchen were illegal. I watched in horror as they tackled the cook to the floor with love and adoration. I'm sure they must have envied the only woman on board. Those two fellows, Simon and Angus backed away from the screaming women and over towards me. I pulled up my hood, and shrunk behind—well Twatt is gone. How did he disappear? So I was momentarily by myself. \"How are you enjoying the tour?\" Angus said, putting his arm around me. You could tell he was trying to be really smooth about it. \"Er, great.\" I said. I had to get away fast. I pulled my sweater tighter around me and unwound myself from his arm and went my own way. \"Wait, you can't leave the tour.\" \"We're on a boat, you nut.\" I heard Simon say as I retreated. I managed to leave without them making a huge fuss over it. The corridor I was in was empty, but you could hear the faint laughter in the background. I slipped my sunglasses, just in case someone recognized me. I made my way quietly, listening for Twatt. The slapping of men's shoes could be heard on the metal floors and quickly went outside. On deck, I caught a glimpse of him going through a door, which I swiftly followed suite. Down a few sets of stairs, I came upon an open door. NO ENTRY, it said. Yeah, right. I pushed through, thinking that Twatt was actually pretty smart for a ministry nimrod. I tiptoed down the steps, and came up beside him. \"Hey.\" I whispered. \"Jesus!\" He jumped almost a foot into the air. \"Girl, you shouldn't be down here.\" \"Relax, we're both here for similar reasons.\" I said. But I gave him his space anyways. He was observing the conditions of their pipes and engine and whatnot, so I sat back in the corner, still keeping ol Twatty in view. I heard footsteps from the stairs on the other side of the room, so I hid behind a boiler. I couldn't exactly warn the man without giving away my position. \"Hello.\" My senses spiked and I tried my best not to breathe, but every little movement I made sounded amplified. \"Can I help you?\" I peeked around the boiler and was glad he wasn't talking to me. A stylish man was talking to Twatt. \"Oh yes, uh, hello.\" I almost face palmed, because Twatt sounded like a huge pushover. \"Got a bit lost.\" Even better response. \"More than a bit. In order to get here, you have to open a really quite heavy door with the words no entry on it.\" \"Well I didn't see that so it must have been left open.\" Kudos to that clever response. The man approached Twatt, and eyed him through his glasses. \"You look suspiciously square to be a fan of this boat's output.\" \"No, no. No I'm a real fan.\" \"I hope so, because if word gets out that you're here to spy on us, I think you may have trouble hanging onto your testicles.\" \"Are you threatening me?\" Fucking Twatt. There was a short pause. \"Do you know what? I think I am. Because I've got pretty good instincts, and you look like a twat to me.\" I had to hold back a laugh that could have blown a hole in the side of the ship. \"Get out of here!\" I heard Twatt start to leave. \"Everyone leaves in fifteen minutes!\" He yelled again. I watched as they left, and when I heard the door shut behind the other man, I came out of my spot. In my excitement, I slipped, falling under something. In the last seconds, I felt my head smack against the metal, causing me to black out. This does put a damper on things… Review Please! The next update probably wont be until after my exams which end next Monday (hooray, right?) but I'll probably end up updating earlier anyways lol… -sage94[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Sweet Caroline When I woke up, my ears were ringing and I felt like throwing up. I found the source of my waking digging around in behind some pipes. \"Come to Daddy.\" Its voice rasped pleasantly. It reminded me of something I'd heard before… I cracked open my eyes, realizing my sunglasses were still on, and saw a hunched over figure in a purple suit. He swirled around and was about to leave. And through my blurred vision, I could see it swig a bottle of most likely alcohol. I could use some. I decided to make my presence known. I gurgled something incomprehensible, and the footfalls stopped. Whoever it was—I finally decided it was a person—stopped just short of me and squatted down and observed me. \"Mark, Mark, Mark.\" \"Who?\" I asked. My voice sounded disastrous. \"He's better than I thought.\" I tried to pick myself up, but I wasn't strong enough. \"How did you get down here, sweetheart?\" his voice rasped. My memory jogged for a while; who was this? \"I fell.\" I said simply, not feeling like getting into details. I remembered falling after trying to get out of here, and a lot before that about trying to sabotage… Radio Rock. Ah hell. This was Gavin bloody Kavanagh. \"Well help me up.\" I said suddenly. While I was thinking he was giving me the once over one too many times. He placed his hands under me, one under my head, and the other dangerously close to my butt. His hand under my head recoiled and my head dropped to the floor, and I gasped at the pain. \"What's wrong with you?\" I asked, feeling the back of my head. It was warm and wet. Oh. I looked up into his eyes, then his hands, which had a bit of blood on them. \"Sorry dear.\" He then picked me up bridal style, and carried me upstairs. \"There's no need, I can walk to the boat.\" \"Luv, the ferry left a long time ago.\" We exited the little area we were in, and went on deck. It was a little cold, and it was only drizzling a little bit. And it was definitely not daytime. \"Oh,\" was all I said. \"Let's get Felicity to have a look at ya.\" He propped open a door with his foot to where the rest of the cabins and kitchen were. \"Hello, hello everyone. I found one of Mark's doings. Made her forget how she got here.\" He introduced me to a room full of men who were either playing pool, smoking or drinking. I sighed, realizing earlier he was referring to the famous Midnight Mark. Ah crap, now I look like a whore. Kavanagh set me down on a couch, shooing a few people out of the way in the process. I knew this would go terribly wrong in so many ways. \" I'm only kidding, the bird hit her head. Found her by the engine. Felicity.\" The only woman approached me, Felicity, with a wet cloth and a package of ice. Felicity was quiet, and I could barely hear her tell me to lie on my back because I was drifting in and out of sleep. She carefully dabbed at the back of my head. \"What's your name deary?\" She said quietly, so no one else could hear. I could hear the focus in her voice. \"Caroline.\" I said a bit louder than I intended. I took my mother's name. Even though she bothered the hell out of me. \"Well Caroline, your scalp will be just fine. It's got all this lovely hair covering it. Not sure about the bump surrounding it though.\" \"Er, thanks.\" I said, not sure how to respond. I felt it, and felt a wave of nausea sweep over me. \"So what are we going to do with you, Caroline?\" Gavin asked loudly. He stared around the room, opening this up for discussion. Just send me home, this is embarrassing enough. No more revelations need to be brought to light. However chatter immediately erupted, and I heard some things I'd rather have waited to hear until I was thirty or something. Don't get me wrong, they were positive, but uh... \"I vote she stays until she's better.\" Gavin said. I wish he hadn't said a word. Concurrences were heard all around and I sunk my face into the couch cushions. Babbling ceased, and boots could be heard echoing in the hall. \"Shut up, its Quentin.\" Someone yelled, in some god-awful American accent. My head was pounding worse than a hangover. A door opened and the same man from whenever earlier waltzed in. \"What's going on? I heard happiness.\" The man, Quentin said. \"You did.\" Someone said. \"What brings this foreign emotion onto my crew?\" \"Gavin found a girl on board.\" \"And the actual girls aren't supposed to come until next weekend. He cheated.\" That had to be Dr. Dave. I think. Their radio voices were different. \"Where was she found?\" He directed his question at Gavin, but he was looking at me suspiciously. Heck, I would look at me suspiciously. I was still wearing my glasses. \"Engine room.\" There was a long pause. \"She stays in my room.\" I heard a lot of disappointment. \"She's off-limits until she regains some of her senses.\" Quentin led me to his room, where I plopped onto the bed, clutching my ice pack to my head. \"I'd lock the door if I were you.\" He pulled out a cigarette and offered me one. I waved it off; odd of me to do. \"Where are you staying?\" I asked groggily. \"With one of the crew.\" \"Do you have a bucket or something?\" I asked suddenly, as Quentin was about to leave. \"I have a rubbish bin, beside the night stand.\" He said warily, already leaning out the door. \"Good.\" I muttered, and lunged for it, emptying my stomach into the poor little bin. \"I reckon you have a concussion.\" I leaned away from the edge of the bin, to look at him lazily. \"Maybe.\" He chuckled, but exited the room. I threw up one last time before lying down on his bed. I didn't dream the last night, which always frustrated me. I woke up again with an ache on my head, but it was milder. I stood, and felt around at the back of my head, which was still tender. Everything was still a little hazy surrounding last night. I pried off my sunglasses, which I could feel had left little imprints on my face, especially on the bridge of my nose. I heard the knob turn on the door, and I shoved my sunglasses back on. \"Hello, luv. Just came to see how sleeping beauty was doing.\" Gavin poked his head in. His shaggy head was adorned with his sunglasses and a fedora. I ignored that odd greeting, \"What time is it?\" I asked. \"Nearly eleven.\" I nodded, but he didn't leave. \"I can bring you a change of clothes if you like.\" \"That would be great.\" I said sitting back on the bed. It was way too bright in here. I wondered what he would bring me as clothing; maybe something of that woman Felicity's. I cocked an eyebrow, expecting him to be on his way. He smirked, and left the room. I shut the door behind him, and walked around the cramped room. It was mostly filled with clothes, which littered the floor. Nice suits and shirts. I found a full-length mirror, and checked my horrid reflection. My hair, which I didn't normally brush, was a rat's nest. My clothes, which were used to their normal wrinkle, were fine. I couldn't complain there. I finger combed my hair, failing at trying to be careful with the back of my head. Sometimes with my hair I had to use force. People said it seemed to look okay though. Finally, all the knots were out, and my hair was as good as new. Except, I'd probably need a good shower in the near future. The door was opened by the true-to-his-word Gavin. He held clothes in his arms, and set them on the bed. \"I guessed your size.\" \"Guessed my size?\" I wasn't offended. But I looked at the clothes and wondered how he had procured them. \"Can you let me change then?\" I asked awkwardly. \"Sure.\" He didn't move. \"I'm not sure you know you're supposed to exit the room, or at the very least turn around.\" I commented, and eyed him warily. \"The very least, for sweet Caroline.\" He pivoted, only to face the wall behind him. \"You're ridiculous.\" I said as I pulled my old shirt off. \" You're ridic —\" He didn't finish his retort, as he peeked over his shoulder. \"No peeking.\" I snapped. I quickly pulled on a shirt. He didn't answer to that. I finished pulling on some clothes that I had to laugh at. \"I look like I'm thirty or something.\" I said, looking at myself in the mirror. Not that I meant the outfit any disrespect by exaggerating the age of it, because it still looked decently aged, but I felt older in it: the loose green pants clung kind of low on my hips for my taste, then my shirt was short with black and white stripes. And the lower cut was probably meant for a push up bra. Classy. \"Well, not thirty per say.\" \"Shall we do lunch then?\" He offered, clearly not worried about the outfit. I figured I might as well go thank Felicity for usage of her wardrobe. \"Sure.\" \"Aren't you going to take off your glasses sometime?\" He tried sounding casual about wanting to see my face. \"I tried, but the light is too bright. Concussion, remember?\" He nodded. \"And what about yours?\" \"I've had them glued to my face.\" It wasn't that funny but I let him think I thought it was by laughing, and we continued onto the lounge area. \"She's awake, everybody.\" He shouted once we'd arrived. I cringed at the loud noise. I strode awkwardly across the room towards Felicity. \"Thanks for the clothes, Felicity.\" I murmured to her and sat in a swivel chair beside her. \"Oh those don't belong to me, Caroline.\" She said shyly. \"Whose clothes are these?\" I asked aloud. \"Who knows?\" A voice said. I turned and saw that Dave had spoken. \"What?\" I asked. \"Well, I'd say those are from Gavin's pile. Or was it you, Mark?\" Dave said. Among the others I saw Midnight Mark, who shrugged. Oh crap. I finally realized I was wearing some other chick's clothes that probably got laid on this boat. \"Ew.\" I said out loud before I could stop myself. I was not pleased to receive the laughter that came next. \"The look on your face was priceless.\" Dave said, slapping my bum. I jumped away, with an involuntary short squeal. \"So Caroline, it's always nice to meet a fan. Where are you from?\" \"London.\" I said quickly. I wish the conversation didn't turn this way. Another voice piped in. The American. \"Say, I recognize you from somewhere.\" \"Well, I was on the tour yesterday.\" I said, trying to sound like a normal fan. \"No, no. I'm sure I've seen you somewhere else.\" He was happy now, but if he kept egging on, I'd be faced with a mob, or something. \"I would have remembered ever seeing you guys before,\" I said, feigning adoration. \"You sure? I haven't like slept with you, or maybe a sister?\" \"I definitely would have remembered that,\" Because then the imagery would be playing over and over in my head, and I'd have something worse than a concussion. \"You're probably right.\" He leaned back in his seat, still content I guess. Egos. \"You know what?\" We all turned to the door, where Quentin appeared. \"I think I need a word with our new passenger.\" I felt the back of my head for comfort, and headed towards him, trying my best the whole while to not look nervous. Quentin pointed out the door towards the deck. It was overcast outside. \"What was it that you, er, wanted?\" I stammered. \"I know who you are. And it's definitely not this Caroline character.\" His voice was gradually rising. \"Well you see—\" I started. \"You're here to spy on us for the government.\" He declared. I winced at his words. I couldn't agree to that and come up with a logical lie from the top of my head. \"No, I'm not.\" Quentin lowered his gaze, which was previously raised, probably because he thought he was right. Now he looked at me expectantly. I would have to tell some sort of truth. \"Well of course you're not.\" He said. I heard the door behind us creak open. \"Oi, what's with all the shouting?\" Angus. I prepared myself for the worst. \"Caroline isn't Caroline.\" Quentin said smugly. \"I'm—I'm…\" I spluttered. Ah fuck, just tell them. \"I'm from Pop Wave.\" I yanked off my glasses and sunk my head. \"Hey, its Meryl!\" \"I thought she looked familiar.\" \"I knew all along.\" \"How're the ladies doing?\" \"What's it like being unemployed?\" Those were just a few of the responses. This one was the worst, however. \"Throw the girl overboard.\" Stupid fucking American. \"Smashing idea, Count.\" Gavin said, coming to his side. Somewhere along the lines of everyone cheering to throw me over, Gavin Kavanagh picked me up unceremoniously. \"Hey, you can't be serious, let me go!\" I shouted, and tried punching him. \"Someone grab her legs.\" I hoped all it was, was that they were caught up in the moment. Most likely not, I realized, as the cold water of the North Sea slapped me in the face. \"Holy fuck!\" I screamed, as soon as I came to the surface. The clothes I wore were extremely heavy, and having on shoes made swimming no easier. I came up to the side of the anchored boat, and slapped my hand against the metal exterior. \"It's freezing in here, let me back up!\" I yelled up. I couldn't feel my legs. They were already looking over the edge down at me in my ridiculousness. I shivered again, and started seeing black spots. \"F-fuck.\" I whispered. My head bobbed at bit under water, and the water made breathing deeply exceedingly difficult. \"Only if you call me gorgeous every time you see me.\" Gavin rasped. \"F-fine.\" \"And only if we can publicly humiliate you in front of 23 million people.\" The Count said. \"Hell no!\" I shouted, and pushed away from the boat. \"It's a pretty good day to drown in the North Sea.\" He said. \"A-and what if the government finds out you killed someone?\" I said. I heard them all agree that that wouldn't look too good. I couldn't focus on them too much, me fingers were no longer pliable. Eventually someone threw over a sling ladder, and I eagerly latched onto it. When I got to the top, I was ready to drop. \"You people are insane.\" I managed to seethe, before falling to the deck. \"Shit. Is she dead?\" Simon said. \"Someone get the stowaway a towel,\" Quentin said. \"Fucking right.\" I tried to pry my shirt from my body, but it clung tightly to me. I mean, it was just embarrassing knowing that everyone could see more than I wanted them to. It made me want a sweater. \"Watch your mouth young lady.\" The Count said. \"Piss off.\" \"You know, you'd actually be less cold if you weren't wearing those drenched clothes.\" John from their news broadcast said. \"Excellent suggestion—\" \"Shut up.\" I said, still shivering. Someone threw a towel on my head, and I wrapped it quickly around me. \"I suppose we could let her dry off inside.\" Quentin said. Despite the fact that being inside would be the very first objective on my Things-to do List, I waited until everyone went in before me. I hung at the back, but someone was also lagging behind. \"Hey, I was wondering if you—did you want to use my room to change?\" \"I'm sorry, who are you?\" I asked. I'd never seen him before, nor heard of him. He seemed closer to my age though. \"I'm Carl… I'm sorry, it was a stupid suggestion, I'll just let you be—\" I felt bad, because I realized I just sounded extremely bitchy, and he was tripping all over his words. \"No, no, it was a nice offer. I think I'll take it.\" I said warmly, or what I hoped was. I think I gave a nice enough smile. Instead of following the rest of the men into their lounge area, I followed Carl to his room. He let me in his room by myself, choosing to stay outside . \"Hey, um, Carl do you have any clothes I could borrow?\" I asked, pressing the side of my face against the door. \"Yeah,\" He said, startled, \"check my bottom drawers.\" I went through his stuff. Unfortunately for me, he was no Gavin, having other girls' clothes hanging around, which I never suspected anyways because this boy was nice. But I found a nice loose button-up that would be baggy enough to hide the fact that I wasn't wearing a bra. Oh the joys of being thrown in the ocean with all your clothes on. Anyways, I tried on a pair of his gray pants, which were still snug on me. I silently said sorry, because I would have to go commando on this one, at least until my other clothes dried. I was surprised my eyeliner wasn't too bad, but I fixed the smudges up. This was pretty unmovable stuff. And don't mention my hair, I usually let the black mass do its own thing. \"Thanks for the clothes, Carl.\" I made him jump, as he had his back on the door when I opened it. \"Oh, no problem.\" \"Where shall I put these clothes?\" \"Just put them in the hamper, and we'll get to washing them later.\" He assured me. We walked silently away from his room towards the others slowly. \"So what shall we call you?\" He asked finally. \"I dunno, nothing derogatory.\" \"Felicity wouldn't have that. I kind of like Caroline.\" He said meekly. \"Well then I kind of like Carl. When do I get to go home?\" I said a little too eagerly, his face fell a little at the last part. \"Next weekend people are coming on the boat, so you could probably catch a ride back with them.\" \"Oh.\" I hadn't realized that I could be here for a while. Carl took us back to the lounge. \"Carl, I never took you for the type.\" Dave said suggestively, literally the moment we walked in. Everyone cheered for him. It was awkward, because we both looked at each other and thought 'oh shit'. Mark came by and patted him on the back, and I heard the clink of beer bottles colliding. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Gavin rolling his eyes, which made me happy in a way. \"Excellent work.\" \"How was she.\" \"How did you do it?\" yada, yada, yada. \"Nothing happened.\" He said plainly. A great groan waved over from them. \"Everybody quiet, we need to sort out when she can get out of here.\" Quentin said as he walked in. Please Review! I like it better than favourites and story alerts combined! And uh, suggestions are helpful, aha… -sage94[Chapter 4] Mad hatter: Aha no, no, he's a hilarious character, I just thought he be great for poking fun at Meryl. He's actually one of my favourites. And of course, I love Carl :3 Scarymouchemusic: maybe there will be ;) Chapter 4: Her I had to sit on the couch. The Count and Gavin had taken it upon themselves to converse with Quentin about what they should do with me. I honestly can't see how their input would affect Quentin's decision though. Carl came to sit beside me, while that guy Simon offered me a tea. \"Thanks.\" I curled my legs up to my chest. I should have hypothermia or something, but I felt fine, other than the subtle throb at the back of my head. \"We have decided that the only time we can introduce you live on air is sometime near the end of the week, Sunday-ish, but that would mean you would miss the boat Saturday.\" \"Why can't you just let me on for two minutes on Monday?\" \"Because there are less listeners during the week, and we'd rather prolong your suffering.\" Quentin said. \"Right. And what's to stop me from leaving with that boat Saturday?\" \"Nothing really, your ex-crew would be just known as chickens with no sense of honour.\" The Count said, leaning closer to me. \"I kind of don't mind.\" I said all nonchalant. \"I don't think the girls will take that too well.\" Gavin said, observing his . \"Well, I suppose being a chicken would hinder me getting a new job. What are you going to do while I'm on air?\" \"We don't know yet.\" \"I'll tell you what. I'll humour you all by staying as long as necessary to get this monkey off my back.\" \"Good girl.\" The Count said. I really wasn't all that impressed because they weren't sure what to do yet, but hey, maybe I could learn a few things. \"Why would you accept?\" Carl whispered to me when we were one of the only ones in the lounge. People had gotten back to work. \"I dunno, for fun?\" I said. \"All I'm saying is that from experience, most of the guys aren't too trustworthy.\" \"But aren't you like friends with them?\" \"Sure, but they're not very mature.\" \"Like me?\" I countered. I just wanted him to know that I could handle it. \"I'm just warning you, there is no propriety when it comes to them. It's their ship.\" I took his words to heart, surprisingly. I wanted to be prepared if anyone wanted to pull something. I don't need another dip in chilly waters. I didn't really want to stay in Quentin's room, mostly because I wanted to befriend Carl better. \"Hey Carl, can I stay in your room?\" I asked. \"Well… the thing is, I'm rooming with Kevin.\" \"Kevin? What's wrong with him?\" \"Well, he's a bit thick. I mean he's nice and all, but I don't know if he'd move.\" \"I'd be okay with sleeping on the floor.\" \"I couldn't do that to you.\" \"You're not. I volunteer to sleep on the floor.\" I smiled quickly, and patted him on the head. For a while, he was the only one I wanted to hang around with. Steadily, I started to lurk around the boat. I mostly went to watch the DJ's. They were pretty good. I mean, I thought I was decent, but when you saw some people like Simon, you could see they put a lot of energy into it. I started to warm up to Harold. He was probably the most normal one on this boat, other than Carl and myself. I ended up going sneaking into some of the DJ's rooms because they actually had clothes I could wear from previous sexual encounters they had with women who left their clothes. I almost wondered if it was because they thought they would get the chance to come back and sleep with them again. But with the wide variety of clothes I saw, I determined that there was no way that any of these clothes belonged to one woman. The second day I was on the boat, I went into Gavin's room to find a decent pair of pants, but he came into his room. Gavin opened the door, \"Oh, excuse me for wanting to enter my own room.\" I turned and smirked, \"That's alright, just next time give me a fair warning.\" \"You know, I never asked you how you came to be downstairs.\" I felt my face flush pink. \"Well, I sort of was… snooping. And when I ran to leave, I slipped.\" He smirked, and pulled a cigarette out of his blazer pocket and lit it in his mouth. \"You know, I never asked you how you came to be downstairs.\" I asked him. He leaned in a bit, to whisper close to my ear. \"Right, well, don't tell the lads, but that's where I keep the good stuff.\" \"Oh, right, I thought I saw you take a swig of something.\" I went to leave, but he wrapped an arm around my shoulders, and walked me to the lounge. \"Let me walk you,\" he said. When we got back, I saw the reason why he would do that. Sitting on the couch across from me, was Carl. I rolled my eyes, and slipped from out of his grip and ran to sit beside Carl. \"Hi!\" I said a bit flustered. \"Oh, hi.\" I noticed he was a tad crestfallen. \"How are you—\" I started by asking him how he was, but good old Gavin Kavanagh cut me off. \"Hey, lad, are you still on about Marianne?\" He asked offhandedly. \"Marianne?\" I asked amused. \"Oh right, the bird doesn't know about Marianne.\" Gavin feigned forgetfulness. Again, I rolled my eyes. Carl ended up being embarrassed. Later, when I got Gavin to go away (actually he had to go on air) I asked Carl about Marianne. She was this gorgeous girl who he'd met for the first time, a niece of Quentin's, and had a nice evening with, and he took her back to his room. When he went to go get a condom and come back to his room, he instead found her in Dave's room, naked. Hell, I'd be angry too. Carl was reluctant to tell me, and I deduced that this was more of a story to be told to other guys, not a girl. That night, I couldn't sleep much. I was thinking of what I would be doing after this whole thing was over. Hopefully Jackie would find a ship. Holy crap, and hopefully Molly and Justice thought I fine! I hadn't thought of them much, but if it were them, I would be standing on my head with worry. I looked at Carl's clock from the floor, and saw it was two o'clock in the morning. Wonderful. I left the room, and headed for the kitchen. I need something to eat. On my way, I stopped in the lounge. The lights were on, and out of habit I was going to turn them off, but a man I hadn't seen piped in, \"No, don't.\" \"Oh sorry.\" I was about to leave, but I realized I'd never seen this fellow before. He wasn't dressed as part of the actual crew, nor the DJ's. He was wearing some Indian robe, and slacks. His beard was everywhere. \"Um, who are you?\" \"I think that's an odd question for you to ask.\" He said meekly. Right, I was technically the stranger. \"I'm Bob. The Dawn Treader?\" \"You're Bob? Unreal. I was a big fan—\" I stopped myself. I had just admitted to one of the DJ's that I was an avid listener. \"Don't tell anyone I said that.\" I stated quietly. \"Oh, right, you're the girl from Pop Wave. They were talking about you the other night.\" He was very shy with the way he spoke. \"How come I never see you all the time like the others?\" I asked. I preferred to deviate from the subject of me. \"Well my show starts in an hour. From three to six in the morning. I sleep a lot, and keep to myself; I focus a lot on my show.\" He seemed maybe a little intimidated. I didn't understand that part. \"I know. Again, don't tell anyone, but before I first joined my boat five months ago, when I was in school I guess, I used to listen to you instead of study.\" Didn't I just say I didn't like putting the spotlight on myself? Maybe I just compensated for his quietness. \"Well, I better go get ready for my show.\" He ruffled his long shaggy hair self-consciously and left. \"Wait! Can I come watch?\" I asked. I don't know why I wanted to. He halted, not moving for a few seconds, but waved me to follow. I bounced along after him. Though he sounded timid in person, he had the perfect voice for early morning radio. It wasn't the type of voice to annoy you, especially when all you want to do is have some down time, but it was smooth, and wise, and I liked that he picked velvety songs to match his intensity. I curled up in a large, worn leather loveseat, and soon found myself listening to his voice as I slept. \"Up ye get, Meryl.\" Bob had pulled me up by my armpits, \"You don't want to sleep here.\" \"Is your show over?\" I asked dazedly. He nodded, and grunted trying to lift me. I shrugged him off, \"It's okay.\" I could tell his age was getting to his strength. For the rest of the day, again, I tried to watch their shows, and I did, but I was after all worried I'd get some sort of mention on the radio. For the first time, since I was twelve, I listened to Gavin on the radio. I remember being appalled and blushing and all when I'd heard him all those years ago, and today was no exception. Since I was usually broadcasting, and I refused to listen to him when he came back because my ratings plummeted, I hadn't heard him. Before he waltzed up to his microphone, he said, \"Watch and learn, sweetheart.\" I let him set up, and I stood on the other side of the glass, and watched him swivel his chair to face me. \"Evening, gentlemen and schoolgirls. Were you being naughty? Were you doing something that would make your parents' hair curl? Gavin knows. Let Gavin tune the judgement out.\" He flicked on some Rolling Stones straight away. I couldn't see what his eyes were expressing, but I sure knew how I felt. Just like the same blood rush as all those years ago, but worse, because the feelings weren't so foreign. When he spoke, a shiver made its way tapping up my back. I almost wish I wasn't standing, because I could feel my knees weaken. This can't happen. I went to go sit down in a chair, and just so happen to be sitting beside Midnight Mark and Doctor Dave. I let out a shaky breath. They gave me suspecting looks. \"What?\" I snapped. All I got was the old raised eyebrow. In attempts to silence them, I tried this out, \"Its okay, I'm a lesbian.\" \"There's no way after that.\" Dave said. Mark puffed out smoke, and surprisingly spoke, \"No sir.\" \"Fine.\" I tried not to turn around and look at Gavin, but I still couldn't help but peer over my shoulder every now and then. \"Well, the tension is too high for me. I'm going to grab a beer. Mark?\" Dave said, rising from his seat, and rubbing his rather large stomach. Mark looked from Gavin, then to me, and stood. I narrowed my eyes at him. \"I'm coming.\" I said quickly, and looked one last time over my shoulder. Gavin gave me the old peace-sign kiss. \"Dangerous.\" Dave said. I huffed, and hit his podgy back. Instead of following them, I walked out on deck, where the sun was setting. I saw the Count, standing by the rail, and looking out to sea. I wasn't going to join him but I saw a cigarette in his hand. \"Hey.\" I said. He half turned to me, and cocked his brow, but went back to staring out at sea. \"Do you got a cigarette?\" I asked. Without speaking, he handed me one from his pants pocket. He was a lot more serious than I thought he would be. \"Thanks.\" I pulled out a lighter that Carl kept in his pants, and lit myself, but didn't leave the Count, surprisingly. \"Do you hate me?\" I tried to make it seem like if he answered yes or no, I wouldn't care. \"Not really.\" \"Oh.\" \"But I did try to vote you off the boat.\" I liked that he was honest. \"Good.\" I knew he didn't want me off for the same reasons I used want to get out of here, but we were almost on the same page. \"So, why are you talking to me?\" he asked incredulously. \"I needed a smoke.\" He nodded. \"So how come I have to stay here longer?\" I always wondered what they were talking about, the three of them. \"Gavin insisted. And what Gavin wants, Quentin is willing to compromise.\" \"Oh.\" More silence. \"Why did you shut down our boat?\" He chuckled a bit, but kept mostly sober. And if it wasn't such a personal matter, I could see myself laughing along with him, but I kept my poker face. \"Honestly, it was just for fun.\" \"You know, I'm surprised you guys would actually do something like that. I mean, you seem like a good group of guys—to each other, not around regular people—and I would think you'd respect that other people want to live this kind of life.\" He didn't say anything, and I could see his brain tinkering along to what I'd just said. \"And I mean, even though I'm a girl, I know you can relate to someone who only wants to live for that rock and roll.\" He lowered his head a bit, but just in thought. \"Just something to think about.\" I finished my cigarette, and blew smoke in his face. He stood still for a while, but I went inside because it was getting cold. The next few days went by quicker than expected. Before I knew it, it was a lovely Saturday morning. I woke up to have my regular tea with Carl. Everyone else was awake, and excited. \"What are you all ancy about?\" I asked to no one in particular. I was observing their faces, which were all the same dazed, dreamy faces. \"The girls.\" \"Oh yeah.\" I said. I shrunk a bit back in my seat. I knew that the only thing that would be happening on this boat would be something I definitely would not be participating in. \"Carl, you didn't invite anyone, did you?\" I whispered to him. I learned that you couldn't say much out loud without garnering everyone's attention. God, their lives are boring, aside from buggering each other's lives up. Carl awkwardly scratched his head. \"Not exactly.\" He said loudly. \"It's the sad room for Carl, then.\" Angus teased. Dave punched his arm, probably because he felt kind of bad for what he did to Marianne. \"It's okay, Carl, I'll be here for moral support.\" I wrapped my arm around his shoulder. \"You sure you don't want to join me for im moral support?\" Gavin said. \"Damnit, Kavanagh, mind your own business.\" I cracked. \"Say, Caroline—er, Meryl, I never really asked… How old are you?\" Carl whispered when the attention dwindled away from us, and a couple hours had passed. \"Well, Christ, I'll be eighteen by the start of November.\" I leaned away. That left only a few weeks of October until the day. \"I thought you were a little older.\" \"Don't I seem young?\" I asked. \"Not all the time. I guess. I dunno.\" Quentin announcing the arrival of the boat of whores interrupted us. Whoops, did I think that up? I supposed I might as well go up to the deck and see what all the fuss was about. When I got to the railing where everyone was stationed, looking out at the approaching boat, like they haven't seen a woman in a while. Okay, maybe I didn't count too much. Anyways, the boat had probably a few more girls than there were men on Radio Rock, including the actual ship's crew. Someone was obviously getting an odd number of girls. My gag reflex trembled at the thought. I dreaded thinking of who that would be. But I instantly thought of Gavin and Mark. To avoid any further awkwardness, I went to wait in the lounge, and thereby limiting any eye contact with the men. Despite sex not being my thing, I still had an overactive imagination that I would prefer to repress. Every now and then, a DJ would walk by with one or two ladies on his arm, but usually only one. \"Be sure not to get too lonely in here, eh?\" Dave said, towing a lady. \"Oh, I won't,\" I said, trying to look busy. He walked away, and I tried not to think about Dave naked. Bad mental images will be created. \"So no plans for you four?\" I asked, after tapping the desk for about a minute. I was staring at John, Carl, Felicity and Simon. They awkwardly shook their heads, and were poorly explaining why not. I got up and went to go sit next to Simon. \"What about you , Simon?\" I asked, poking his arm for effect. \"Oh, I'm not really into… I'm more the kind of person who's waiting for… the one.\" I smiled internally. His face showed worry, like maybe he wondered if I thought he was peculiar or something. \"No worries mate, I respect that.\" I nodded. The Count walked by with two women, tipping an imaginary hat to us sitting in the room. Shortly after, Gavin walked by, but stopped, and smirked at us, and our non-sexual activities. He pulled the cigarette from his mouth, and smirked. My eyes travelled to the beauty on his arm. As recognition struck me, I just about screamed. I knew her alright. Please REVIEW! :D -Sage94[Chapter 5] Woo don't forget to REVIEW after you read this chapter guys! Chapter 5: Moans Her. Marlow. She's my sister. Or at least I used to think she was. I don't really know what to call her nowadays. I mean, we grew up together; we played when we were little, we had the exact same parenting, but sometimes, as she became older, I questioned that relationship. Marlow is about four years older than me. It all began when she was discovered when she was sixteen. She's this big high-fashion model, and I see her pictures everywhere. Literally. At first I didn't think her modelling would get serious, but when my mum took me on holidays to France when I was fourteen, her pictures were in the haute-couture stores that my mother made me accompany her to. I haven't seen her since I was sixteen; she's been all over the world and all this shit, and only sends a postcard to mum, and occasionally dad. Never one mention of me from what I've read. I suppose this is where my mum used to heckle me about initiative, because I have so much to live up to. But what I want to know is how the fuck she's here with Gavin Kavanagh. \"Is that you, Meryl?\" She asked, peering around Gavin. She removed her bug-eyed glasses, to reveal perfectly lined eyes, which were squinted in recollection. \"Lovely to see you, Marlow.\" I forced out of my mouth. \"You ladies know each other?\" Gavin asked. I briefly wondered if he knew we were related, but I decided it was impossible, because there was no way of telling straight away, only if you knew where to look. \"Oh, that's my darling little sister.\" That must be her classy way of speaking, saying what she thought was ladylike vocabulary; words like darling. What the hell. Gavin chuckled. \"There's no way you're related to that troll.\" He said to her. \"Hey!\" I yelled. I wasn't a troll. Despite not being model-esc like Marlow, I still had my looks too. I just looked rougher around the edges in terms of grooming. My hair was long, wild and wavy, while she kept hers perfectly straight and shoulder length. I kind of envied that hair; I just didn't put any effort. Now that I think about it, there wasn't much different about our faces, but she had mum's tiny ski-jump nose, and mine was simple and straight. We both had the cheekbones, but hers were more pronounced. Mostly because she was so fucking skinny. Like I've been told I could use a few cheeseburgers myself, and I agree, but she was waif thin. Although she still managed to get men under her belt, so it seemed. Her eyes were also blue, whereas mine were dark brown, like my dad. I guess I could go on forever, but it would just annoy the shit out of me, and bore people with how actually perfect my sister was. Or make them fantasize, depending on the person. Marlow put her glasses back on mischievously, and wrapped her arms around his chest and dragged him back. \"Let's get back to that thing you wanted to do.\" Her voice was throaty, and made me want to hurl. \"Sure thing, sweetheart.\" He followed her upstairs, and I couldn't look away quick enough to see him squeeze her bum. \"Well that was disgusting.\" \"She's gorgeous.\" Simon said to Carl. \"Shut up you guys.\" The night couldn't come soon enough. Eventually, the moans died down, and I was allowed to find a book and read in peace. Carl went up on deck with Simon, which I didn't mind, so I was sitting alone. But Dave came out and brought his girl with him. \"Hello, how's solitude treating you?\" He asked. \"Do you want a beer?\" He whispered to the girl beside him and she accepted. \"Perfect.\" I said, and I set down my book to pay attention to them. \"Well, we're all going on deck, if you want to join us.\" \"Is Gavin going?\" I asked. It sounded pathetic to say that out loud. \"Just have a couple beers and don't worry about that, luv.\" He stood with the girl on his arm, and they left. I decided to go, but try not to mind the fact that my sister just had sex no more than ten or so meters away from me. Even if there are walls, its still disgusting to think about. When I came up, I saw lights had been set up, and found I had to cross almost everyone's path to actually get to stand beside Carl. \"Hey.\" \"Wanna grab a beer?\" I asked him. \"Sure, I'll get em.\" He put out his cigarette and went to a little table that was set up that had full and empties alike littering it. Unfortunately, while Carl went to go get them, Gavin approached me. \"She was great.\" He casually sipped his beer. I looked over at my sister, who was talking to a few other girls. Her hair was still straight and perfect regardless of how great she was. \"That's wonderful Gav. Maybe she can stay while I leave on the boat home?\" I suggested. \"Not quite, we still need to intro you tomorrow.\" I cursed under my breath. \"Fine.\" I grumbled, drinking my beer with irritation. \"But I'll be incredibly drunk.\" \"Could be dodgy. I'd be up for it.\" I rolled my eyes at him. Gavin went back to Marlow, attaching himself to her hip, while I was yet again alone. But before I speak too soon, the Count, Midnight Mark and Dave all came to join me as well. \"I heard he had a go at your sister.\" Dave said. \"Disgraceful. You would never fuck a brother's sister.\" \"No secrets here, eh?\" I asked. I don't think Count realized he just counted me among them. \"Afraid not.\" Dave wrapped a tender arm around my waist, and I couldn't help but be amused by his attempt to pick up under the cover of concern. \"You know what would really push his buttons…\" The Count said mischievously, and took a swig of his beer, \"being extra friendly with Carl.\" \"Carl?\" I'd never exactly thought super romantic things about him, but I hadn't ever ruled it out. \"Carl.\" He confirmed. \"What about you guys?\" Not that I would do them this moment. \"As much as I would like to, I like seeing Gavin squirm better.\" Count's eyes squinted in delight. It was scary. \"I would.\" Dave said, tightening his grip around me, which got me giggling. \"Mark?\" I asked. He slowly inhaled his cigarette, and nodded. I nodded as well, smugly albeit, because I'd always wondered how I measured with someone like Midnight Mark—purely for technical purposes. Every now and then I would shoot old Marlow the ever-insulting stink-eye, but without much success, because she would smirk at me with her face all unimpressed. I decided to let the bitch be, and put Count's little suggestion to the test. So soon enough, I became less awkward, and gained some liquid confidence from my drink. Making sure I could see Gavin watching me, I made my way to Carl's side again. \"Hey Carl.\" A voice that was so foreign to my lips: girly as fuck. I put my arm around his shoulders, and pushed my chest a bit out, and stuck out my butt just a bit. I didn't want to look phony to old Gavin. \"Hi, Meryl.\" He was taken aback, but smiled anyways. While Gavin stood across the boat, I knew he was watching, and I looked at him as I whispered in Carl's ear, trying my bet to appear seductive. \"Listen to me, Carl. No, don't look up.\" I snapped, \"I'm trying to piss off Gavin, so I was wondering if you could smile and pretend to be all giddy and whatnot.\" He did as he was told, \"Okay. Oddball.\" \"So I dunno, maybe we'll go back to your room and play cards, but make it look really suggestive. Because I want to make him mad for sleeping with my sister.\" He was close to breaking character, but grinned largely, and we left the deck. I led us through the small throng of people by pulling him by his coat, and we went inside. \"So how long do you usually last?\" I asked, once we were inside. \"What?\" He asked. \"You know, in bed, so this thing is believable.\" We reached his room, and we locked the door after us. \"Oh, um…\" He tilted his head down. \"Awe that's so cute. You're a virgin.\" I noted. \"Hey!\" His cute little forehead wrinkled. \"Well since you know, I can ask if you are.\" \"Do I look like a virgin?\" I crossed my arms. \"No. Well, I dunno, that's why I'm asking.\" \"Oh. I thought I would. So yes, I guess I still am too.\" I scratched my head awkwardly, but decided to laugh it off. \"So do you have cards?\" I asked, before the silence could continue painfully. We were about one round into crazy eights, when I could hear footsteps approaching. Out of some sick impulse, I moaned really loud. \"What was that?\" Carl whispered intensely. \"Shh, play along you idiot.\" He rolled his eyes, and got up to shake the bed. The footsteps retreated, and I sighed in relief. \"Good one.\" I high-fived Carl, and we went back to cards, only getting up every now and then to make outrageous sounds. Once we figured that people had stopped moving around, which was around two o'clock, I got up to leave. \"Well Carl, it's been fun.\" \"You're just going to leave, after our amazing night?\" He asked sarcastically, but he grabbed a hold of my wrist. I glanced down at it with confusion written all over me. \"I'm more of a one night stand kind of girl.\" I winked at him, and he let go, with a funny look on his face. I leaned in to kiss his nose and said, \"let's do that again sometime.\" He grasped the back of my head and quickly pulled me in for the briefest of kisses. Wait, what? I jerked back, and hit my head off the top of the bunk bed. \"Okay, ow.\" \"Sorry, sorry, that was a stupid thing to do…\" He got all embarrassed, which made me feel bad. \"No, it's okay, I was just caught off guard, that's all. Warn me next time you plan to plant one on me after we have fake sex, Carl.\" I ruffled his hair before stumbling out the door. I saw no one in the hallway, but ruffled up all my hair and messed up my clothes anyways in case someone waltzed by. I still couldn't believe what he'd just done. I went to the lounge, where only the Count and Bob were sitting, although not together. \"Is everyone still on deck?\" I asked. \"No, they went back for one last…\" He waved his hands in continuation. One last shag, \"Right.\" \"So…\" He grinned at me. \"I didn't think you'd actually fuck him.\" Was that language necessary? Says the angel . \"Nothing happened.\" \"That's not what Quentin said. Apparently you were loud.\" He chuckled and patted the seat beside him. \"Was that who walked by?\" I laughed at the little stupid act I pulled. \"Again with the no secrets here.\" \"Well you sure had the rest of us convinced. Everyone was actually betting who you'd sleep with first.\" \"That's concerning.\" \"Well someone's bound to mention your promiscuity tomorrow on air.\" \"Is all this needed? Can't we just make up and let me be on my way?\" I asked. I don't think I really meant it. I kind of liked it here, minus the obvious people. Person. \"You might as well, I mean, you've been here this whole time.\" \"But that's because I couldn't leave.\" I think that was a lie. I'd probably be a bit reluctant if I were presented with an exit. This was fun. \"True. I'm going to get back to my room.\" For some shagging. I understood, especially since these men would die if they didn't have sex as often as they did. \"Night.\" \"Morning.\" He corrected. Right, it was only like two-thirty. It was quiet for a bit, and I went to go fix myself a snack. I came back to the lounge and had my nightly chat with Bob. \"Did you, er, invite someone?\" I asked, biting into a piece of toast. He tilted his head downwards, \"Yes,\" was his quiet reply. \"Oh that's lovely, who is it?\" It was so sweet to see an old couple. \"Just a woman.\" He said shyly. Oh Bob. \"Alright, keep your secrets.\" I winked at him, and decided to finish my snack in peace. \"I'm off to my studio. Are you going to come watch?\" He asked, his fingers nervously fidgeting with each other. \"Yeah, in a sec, I was just going to go on deck for a smoke,\" as long as no one was up. \"I'll see you then,\" He shuffled out of the room, and I finished my snack quickly to make it upstairs. It was nice and brisk out, and I was completely alone, which isn't normally possible, even back on my old ship. I felt the buzz of my last beer fading away, but I figured I better stop drinking. I just smoked and looked out onto the waters. The night was pretty cloudy, and I couldn't see much without the moon. Since their boat was stationary, and the whole crew was in their rooms, probably sexing it up, I could understand how an approaching boat could be overlooked. It was moving slowly, probably to avoid detection, especially this early in the morning. I squinted, but couldn't see anyone on this boat. It was in rather good condition, compared Radio Rock's, and to the boat that was parked by us from the ladies. I was about to go back inside and tell someone the boat was almost a hundred meters away, but I heard shouting. Were they yelling my name? Once they were in the light of the deck, I choked on smoke and realized it was my entire crew. I tossed my butt over the rail and told them to quiet down. This was so unreal; I felt my heart warm as a result of this touching moment. It was short-lived, as I would have to again have to explain much to my embarrassment how I came to be stuck here. They lowered a rowboat, and had Molly and Justice come and get me. I was about to step over the rail, when I winced as I heard Carl say my name. \"Meryl, where are you going?\" He said. I was sitting on the rail, torn. \"Shit, hurry up Meryl!\" I could hear Justice whisper furiously. \"I can't stay here forever Carl. And I thought, hey, why not avoid embarrassment?\" I explained poorly. It felt poor because he was the only good friend I'd made, besides awkward Bob, and he would probably get the brunt of the torment from his crew once they find out they've been duped. \"Its not just me leaving, is it?\" I guessed. I'd be all right if it were wrong. I got off the rail, but I went to Carl, to give him a tight hug. \"Dude, I'll always remember you. You should come to shore sometime.\" I tried to keep this goodbye optimistic, because from the week I'd been there, he seemed like the kind of person to let things get to him, even if he were quiet about it. I waved goodbye to him as we left, but his face still held a dumbfounded look to it. I know he was a pretty loyal friend, but I was surprised he didn't move to tell someone. I suppose walking in on someone shagging would be scarring. :O is this the last of them! If you think so, then this is a pretty short story. Bleh. Also, I'm finished my exams woo! I killed my ancient history exam (in a good way), and didn't even study til like last night. -sage94[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Under My Thumb Once they got me inside the boat, the questions and comments came pouring. \"What the hell were you thinking?\" \"Are you okay?\" \"You're lucky we came.\" \"We should have come with you when you asked.\" \"That way I never would have let this happen.\" \"How did you end up staying?\" \"Did they touch you?\" \"How did even going near them get into your thick head?\" \"That was honestly the stupidest thing you've ever done.\" \"Hey, everybody shut up.\" Jackie said, raising her hand. In all my life, I've never been this taken aback by their concern, or whatever this was they were giving off. I think some people were more pissed than others, and at me, to make things ten times better. \"Tell us everything.\" She said calmly. I explained everything from arriving, to falling, and to how they were expecting to embarrass us nationally. Everything except the fact that I had made friends and that I had almost enjoyed myself. And they definitely didn't need to know that my idiot sister was there. I didn't tell many people about her anyways. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have many friends that wanted to be my friend. But I couldn't see how being my friend would better their chances with my sister, since she hardly contacts me. Anyways, I got to stop worrying about her. She can fuck whoever she wants to fuck. \"Well?\" Justice was standing by my side, her hands on her hips, and was staring indignantly at Jackie. \"Well what?\" She asked, suddenly coming out of her focused gaze on the floor. \"What are we going to do about it?\" \"We can't do anything. Not without going back, and we all know how successful that was.\" She looked pointedly at me. I nodded, not disagreeing. \"So where did you get the boat?\" I asked quietly, just to Jackie. \"Only borrowing it, after we all heard about you fucking up, we came to get you.\" She joked. \"Aha, sorry, Jack. So how are we getting back into the scene?\" \"We'll need donations. A lot of them. I called my family everywhere and they're sending in what CD's they can.\" I happened to know that her entire family supported her work on seas. Unlike my own. \"Well that's good, but I meant are you looking at ships.\" \"Oh, yeah. The chap who lent us this boat knows a guy who's willing to sell, now that he's too old.\" She nodded matter-of-factly, and got bored with me, and went back to tending to the boat. I sat by myself, thinking about how swell my departure would go with the rest of the guys on Radio Rock. I'd be surprised if I wasn't humiliated anyways. It was about morning when we arrived back on shore, the sun had already risen quite a bit, and I was twiddling my thumbs nervously, waiting for Simon to say something on air, as he was going to take over for the morning. ' Good morning, England, and you're listening to Simple Simon's Breakfast Show on two-oh-three meters on the medium waveband. You're one of twenty-three million people listening to Radio Rock this morning!\" Simon sounded as he usually did, because his voice woke me up while I was on their ship, but today it didn't make me feel perky, no, it made me nauseas. ' Now, today we promised you all a special guest but unfortunately she couldn't make it out to the studio. Instead, let's have a listen to some Stones, then it's back to John for news at eight.' I knew Simon was courteous enough not to say anything, but I knew Gavin would be dropping hints all over the place when he went on air. \"Well that wasn't so bad.\" Molly said, patting me on the back. Suddenly, though, that sinful voice of Gavin came on air ' It has come to the attention of the rock community that we have lost—only a few weeks ago—the radio station Pop Wave. Most of you probably knew about the rivalry between our two stations, and it would bring us great pleasure to know how these ladies are doing. Our guest agreed to come on air to do a live interview. If it wouldn't be too much trouble, we'd like everyone to help us bring her back to the ship, to finish what bargain we started. The name of this guest is the infamous disc jockette Meryl Ferguson, sister to the famed model Marlow Ferguson.' I did catch that last slam. ' If anyone could help us in bringing her back to us, any and all help would be appreciated. Oh, and Meryl. It's on.' I sank to the floor in defeat. Everyone loved Gavin; they would do anything for him, even bring little old me back. He fed me to the sharks. But I just didn't understand what lengths his fans would go for him. On shore, I looked left and right, because although I was infamous as Gavin put it, I was still sort of noticeable. From the advertising we did, we had a shit ton of posters put up of us to get the Pop Wave name out there. My wanted poster . The whole crew, including me, mistakenly went to get breakfast in town, and someone down at Radio Rock must have said something more descriptive, because we literally sat down, and were bombarded with questions about Radio Rock, and what happened to us. I was asked multiple times about how I knew Gavin. The following weekend, I was back at my house. I had Molly and Justice over and all, and we were talking about Radio Rock. \"So, on the way back, you never really told us what happened.\" Molly said with a wink. \"Yeah, boat full of sex-deprived boys, what was it like?\" Justice asked. Both of them were eating me out of house and home, but Dad really didn't mind because he thought they were gorgeous. I guess the old man is entitled, since he's divorced. \"You're joking right?\" I almost choked on my smoke. \"Especially the way Gavin was talking about you on the radio last week. You really pissed him off.\" \"Ew, he's like really old. And you're listening to them?\" \"Well, what are we supposed to listen to? BBC radio?\" Justice said. \"Don't tell Jackie I said this, but he's actually smokin' hot.\" Molly said, sighing. \"Yeah, he's actually something of a sex god, unless you've been living under a rock.\" Justice, well, justified. \"Slept with a few people I know.\" Molly said, leaning back into my couch further, and set her drink down. \"Molly, you know everyone.\" Justice quipped. It was true. Molly although very cool and collected used to have the habit of sleeping around which I never held against her. She was a bit of a romantic, and thought she fell in love quite easily. \"On the subject of Jackie, she's actually had a brush with that one guy Quinny or something, before.\" I had to laugh at Molly. \"Quentin?\" I wrinkled my nose. \"Quentin.\" She confirmed. \"You mean, they like, had sex?\" I asked. \"Oh Meryl, you're so naïve.\" Justice said, and Molly laughed along, prompting me to kick them both. \"Shut up.\" But I nodded my head a little. Jackie was old enough, I guess, to have sex with a guy as old as Quentin. I mean, she didn't look nearly as old as him, but I never asked how old she was. She looked about forty-ish, maybe a little older, but still in good shape. \"Do you think that's why she didn't want to get back at them?\" \"I wouldn't be surprised.\" Molly said. \"You girls want another beer?\" I rolled my eyes at my dad, who walked into our living room. \"Go away Dad. Stop trying to get my friends drunk.\" My friends giggled. \"Never hurts to try.\" He grinned foolishly, and I could see why my mum used to like this guy. His funny and playful air about him. But I still think he shouldn't flirt in front of his own daughter. Anyways, he left as told raising his hands in defence. When my friends were sure he was away, they looked at me with suspicious eyes. \"You never did answer our original question.\" Justice said. \"It wasn't even a question… more of an inquiry…\" I supposed. \"So did you meet anyone?\" Molly pressed. \"No.\" I said way too quickly. I almost slapped myself for sounding so believable. \"What's his name?\" She asked, leaning in. I groaned, and figured I might as well, \"C-Carl.\" Choosing to ignore my stutter, she persisted, \"Who is that? I know that's not a DJ's name. I think.\" \"No, it's not. Actually, I never asked him why he was there. He didn't clean, or help out much. Maybe he was staying with one of the DJ's.\" I shrugged. \"Is he good-looking, that's what I want to know?\" Justice said. \"Of course.\" Molly answered for me, and I nodded along. \"And you slept with him?\" \"Of c—no. Wait, guys, he's just my friend. I think.\" The recollection of being in his room was more memorable than I would have liked. Because those moments being fuzzy from beer would be all too kind on my feelings. They cocked their eyebrows at me, not at all convinced, and I couldn't blame them because I should feel guilty, but I don't. \"And me , this whole time I thought you were a lesbian.\" Justice commented. Molly snorted. \"Noted. I'll pocket that info for later.\" I said dryly. \"So what are you going to do about this boy?\" Molly asked. \"Well, since we were overall unsuccessful, and I frankly don't need anymore rescuing, I don't plan on doing much.\" I folded my arms across my chest. \"Ah, it was worth a try,\" Molly said, and then downed the rest of her beer, \"We need more drinks.\" \"Oh no. Not in my house.\" \"Wait until tomorrow, we'll get a couple more girls, and go clubbing or something.\" \"Pfft. Good luck getting me in.\" I said. Not because I would have trouble, but now I was not in the mood to drink and smoke. \"Fuck that, you're coming, if Molly has to sleep with every bouncer to get you in.\" Justice promised. \"Hey!\" She shouted. Sure enough, we called Jackie first, who had enough authority to garner up all the girls, and we hit the town, stopping at a god-awful club. There were ridiculously skimpy girls everywhere, while I was in my jeans and tight tee garb. Okay, maybe I brushed my hair. \"We honestly look ridiculous.\" Molly shouted into my ear, over the loud music, \"I shouldn't have worn my bra.\" I sidestepped away from her. Some things should not be brought up. I guess you could say I wasn't as comfortable mentioning my body as everyone else in my crew. I mean, I know how to let loose, but I'm not really a girl girl . Molly patted my back, and went to go dance with a few gents. Me, on the other hand, I went ducked out to the bar down the street to grab a drink, instead of staying in the club to only get packed in there like a sardine. There, I sat at the bar, with a nice pint in between my palms, and I patiently sipped while watching some lads play billiards. I looked at the tacky matching billiards clock up on the wall, and saw that it was about midnight. I'd join up with my friends at about one-thirty or something. Outside of the bar doors, I could hear a rambunctious noise, making me irritated. It sounded like a horde of elephants. Unfortunately for me, they came into the bar, and sat down at the bar, two seats away from me, only some loving couple separating us. It's a nightmare, honestly. Whoever it was placed a hand on my shoulder, trying to get my attention. Poor soul; I felt ready to bitch or something. I turned around, and bugged my eyes. There was no escaping the expression of recognition that passed over the plump man's face. It was Dave. I leaned back against the bar, and frantically looked around him for a route of escape. \"Meryl.\" He said expectantly. \"Sorry?\" I tried to play dumb, no matter how fruitless that attempt was. \"No, no.\" He pressed with a smug smile. \"Dave, please.\" I said, shushing him. \"Persuade me.\" He cocked his eyebrow. \"Don't!\" I shrieked. \"Oi lads, check it out.\" He said rather loudly. I pushed his fleshy chest with my hands, and recklessly pushed past him. However, I unsuccessfully ran into Carl. \"Carl.\" I breathed. We were unnaturally close; I could count the inches between our noses on one hand. \"What are you doing here?\" He asked, flustered. \"No, what are you doing here?\" I asked as well, as his entire crew, aside from Quentin gathered round. \"Meryl.\" Gavin's voice raised my arm hairs, and I cringed. \"What a pleasant surprise. Did your sister mention me?\" \"No, actually, she stated how it was a bit of a disappointment.\" She didn't actually, considering that was the first time I'd seen her in a while, but I figured I'd get a kick out of annoying him. Gavin lunged towards me, raising a hand. Instinctively, I pulled behind Carl. He stopped himself, and stood back to survey us. \"Oh, isn't that just precious .\" I could tell he was irked. We pulled apart instantaneously. \"You did promise us a show full of humiliation.\" Gavin cut right to it. \"No I didn't.\" I said, smiling in innocence. \"Don't you all have a show to go on? Or did you fall apart without me?\" I teased. \"Didn't you hear? Simon is engaged.\" News John inputted. I didn't think he drank. But in fact I did hear that. I didn't want to admit that though, when Simon had announced that on his show, because that would divulge them with information I'd rather not give. \"Oh. Well don't let me ruin this night for you then…\" I gave a nervous toothy grin. \"A stag doesn't not entail fun .\" I didn't like the way Dave said that. \"I don't think I could progress your fun .\" I sneakily started moving towards the door. \"Alright everyone, I have a proposition. To end Gavin's suffering,\" The Count spoke up, \"How about,\" He stroked his beard thoughtfully, for show, \"if you don't come on air yourself, we just tell everyone anyways.\" I didn't like those options at all. Both ended in humiliation. But only one could tell my side of the story. I thought of how going there myself, perhaps with the aid of my own crew could benefit. Well, not exactly, but the situation Pop Wave was in could be saved. \"Can I get back to you on that? I need to… consult with my crew.\" By this time I was standing in front of the door, ready to bolt. \"We'll give you three weeks to respond, any time before that is good.\" The Count offered. \"I say one week.\" Gavin eyed me suspiciously. \"Two weeks!\" \"Done.\" Count confirmed. I propped the door open by my foot, before running out. \"Congrats Simon!\" I shouted, making my way out of their presence. I could hear a faint \"You're welcome!\" coming from the bar. Sorry this took a while… tehe, I had work and shtuff. Yes, I got a job, and a life. Not that that is justification for leaving you guys :( -Sage94[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: Chicken \"This is your chance!\" Molly whispered to me excitedly. \"That boy you like!\" \"No, we can't exactly think about that now , can we?\" I muttered back to her. We had gathered back at my house, crowding into my living room, at three in the morning when I had found them still at the club, and hauled them back. Of course my father was all right with it. He's single. Despite this meeting being at my house, because apparently I was the only person with a stable living place (not entirely true), the older DJ's were mostly the ones speaking on behalf of the rest of us. \"I say this is a brilliant plan. And when they're sleeping, we snap all their records and tapes in half.\" Lacy said excitedly. \"Well, wouldn't this opportunity be very favourable for a… collaboration of sorts?\" Gertrude said wisely. Even though she sounded wise, and I kind of agreed with her, still most of the crew groaned, and started arguing against it. \"Any dealings with these toddlers would be most unpleasant. They've been like this to us since before we set sail, if you recall.\" Kelly justified, trying to silence the bickering. I stopped to think. I'd never heard that story before. It must make sense though, since both our stations had to have started way before I showed up, and Justice and Molly had mentioned that Jackie had an encounter with Quentin. \"We have no choice but to go! We can't let them walk all over us!\" Frankie said. \"If we go, they're going to ruin our reputation!\" Kelly said. \"If we don't go, they're going to do that anyways. We may as well go with what honour we have left. I say no more hiding.\" Frankie argued. \"Same here! There're girls coming around my house looking for you, Meryl, saying Gavin sent them.\" Lacy said. She took on a tone of annoyance that I rarely heard before tonight, and her eyes, I thought, were about to roll themselves out of their sockets. \"Oi, they're still out there?\" Molly asked, prodding my arm. I shrugged. \"I agree…\" Jackie suddenly began. This whole while, she had been sitting, listening to the opinions laid down with contemplative eyes, and everyone shut up to hear her out. \"I agree with Gertrude.\" Everyone who had been against what wise Gertrude had said was clearly disappointed, because they knew that Jackie held the last word. \"But we can't exactly send us all down there.\" Lacy said. \"I'll send myself, along with volunteers. Anyone going in there will certainly not be going alone.\" Two weeks later, we left early in the morning, the seven of us: Frankie, Gertrude, Jackie, Molly, Justice, Thelma and me. I wasn't too excited to go back on, but I could tell that Jackie felt even less excited than me. As Radio Rock's boat lights could be seen in the distance, her face lost a little more colour. I felt bad for even knowing about her and Quentin, since I thought if I slept with someone I wouldn't like some seventeen year old to know. She nervously kept buttoning and unbuttoning her jacket, and looked worse than me on my first date. But what I found funny, as we were approaching, there was already a boat leaving. A young woman, blonde and pretty, maybe a little older than Molly, was pouting, but no tears. Obviously someone on the boat upset her, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was that skank Gavin. She sailed away, leaving the rest of us wondering. There were no DJ's waiting for us outside, which I kind of suspected since this was half unannounced—we didn't tell them we were coming first thing, but we were scheduled to come within the two weeks we were given. We came up to the side, and one of the others who worked on the boat for maintenance came to help us on board, grinning all the while because he probably knew our predicament. Crap already. He showed us to the main lounge, and I already knew the way but stood at the back. When we dropped our stuff, no one occupied the room. I could faintly hear the hums of voices coming from the dining room. \"Jackie they're in the dining room.\" I voiced to her. Uncharacteristically, she whispered to me, maybe sounding a little nervous, \"Should I go, or you? I mean, you have been here before.\" I froze as well, and for a moment, I looked onto Jackie as my equal. I mean, she never really showed her emotions before anything having to do with Quentin, which brought her to the emotional level of a youngster like me. And I hardly ever admitted I was young. \"I'll go.\" I said, and left the rest of my group restlessly annoyed at being there. Also I knew they were uncomfortable, not even two minutes on the boat. I tiptoed to the dining room, a shabby enough place, with generally filthy wear and tear to it much like the rest of this place. I stood in the doorway, and listened for a bit rather than make my presence known, because everyone was gathered, obviously having some heated discussion. Everyone was to one side, save for one man. Unsurprisingly, it was Gavin. Why wasn't I shocked everyone was crossing their arms at him. I mean, typically he was a well-liked guy for his \"cool\" factor, but he seemed like the type to put himself into these types of situations to make him the enemy. \"…It's the dark side of rock and roll.\" Gavin said. I briefly wondered what he did this time. \"Can you tell me one thing?\" I whipped my head to Simon. His usually happy voice was choked with sadness. From this angle, I could see the glare of light against his watery eyes. I never knew Simon closely, but whatever brought his spirits down certainly must have been harsh. \"Before she left this morning, you didn't… you know?\" There was a silence that had me guessing they weren't about to like the answer. I looked at the Count, who was unimpressed to say the least, and rubbed his stubbly face. His inevitable reply came. \"Just one little pop.\" I immediately thought ' wow, who'd he fuck this time? ' \"I thought it was the least I could do after all the trouble the lovely girl had gone to.\" Simon immediately rose, and strode towards the only exit, and I made room in the doorway. The trouble being now, I was in perfect view. Carl quickly followed, but stopped shortly to give me a perplexed look. \"Hi.\" I waved nervously to the rest of the room after Carl had left, unsure of how to react to this somewhat mysterious argument. I tried to ignore Gavin's face, which had turned a tinge smug at my arrival. After everyone somewhat acknowledged my presence in their own way, I managed to see Angus whisper back to Dave, \"Can't blame him though.\" They were still into the argument. \"Oh yeah you can.\" The Count said loudly, not looking back at that nut. \"Mister, have you ever heard of the Vietnam War?\" His sceptical gaze was focused on Gavin harshly. In his amused voice, he replied, \"I have.\" \"Well, that Holocaust is simply a playground skirmish next to what you're about to experience.\" I think his American accent just got a little less annoying as a result of threatening Gavin. Even though Gavin started to chuckle, Count continued, \"I'm declaring war. W-A-R. I'm gonna tear you apart.\" I decided before this would get out of my depth, I would go find Carl, who went after Simon. But first, I decided to tell my crew. On my way back, Quentin came in stride with me to the lounge. \"Back already?\" He asked in a pleased tone. I'd never had a playful banter with him since he always intimidated me a little. \"Brought a little something back with me.\" I bragged, testing the waters with him. \"Is that so?\" He turned to look down at me, his smirk ready, but his eyes unreadable beyond his sunglasses, this fact making me adjust my glasses further up my nose so that my eyes were completely out of view. We turned into the lounge, and I could see his mouth twist in some sort of recognition upon seeing my crew. I'd been waiting for that reaction, actually. Jackie wasn't looking at us, but was in a heated conversation with the rest of my crew. Behind us, Radio Rock filed through, their faces somewhat brightening at our attendance; Obviously not because they were happy to see us. I cringed, because Jackie turned around, and only had petrified eyes for the man standing next to me. I took comfort for her, in that the rest of her face was stone. \"Quentin.\" She stated. \"Jaclyn.\" He said, bemused. I could see my crew's eyes widen, along with my own. No one called her that, and got away with it. She looked down in humour, knowing all too well how she herself reacted to that name. \"It's Jackie.\" \"Not to me.\" His voice was assuming, but Jackie kept her cool. I slipped behind the group, as it was awkward enough already, and went out the door of the lounge to find Carl like I had promised myself. As soon as I turned that corner that led towards their bunks, a hand had already wound itself around my wrist, gripping tight and stopping me. Immediately after I caught my breath I taunted, \"How did you fuck up this time, to make your whole crew angry?\" \"Not how , who .\" Gavin said, not the least bit shameful. I shook my head, putting the pieces together. \"That was Simon's wife!\" I loosened my wrist from his hand. \" Was . She's gone now, so I can't see the problem anymore.\" He waved his hands for emphasis and annoyance, and placed them in his navy trouser pockets. \"Yeah, but guess who's wifeless now?\" I whispered furiously. He paused for a moment and observed me for a fraction of a second. \"I didn't think you cared who I slept with.\" He shrugged, smirked, and left without letting me have a proper chance to respond to that. I'd probably end up coming up with a proper retort hours later when I was left to myself, not that it would matter by then to Gavin. I was glad for the cover of my sunglasses. \"I don't .\" I carried on down the cramped corridor and heard faint sobs coming from Simon's room, and I knocked tentatively. Without waiting for a reply, since there was none, I opened the door to see Carl anxiously sitting on the floor, while Simon sat on the bed. They both looked up to see me. Quietly I shut the door behind me, and went to go sit next to him. \"Do you want to tell me about it?\" I said softly. I knew my voice was much more gentle than I ought to have it in front of these people. As an extra incentive, I started to rub gentle circles on his back, like my grandmother did when I would stay with her, for comfort. I don't quite know why I was being so nice to him. I mean, as I might have mentioned before, he was a jolly enough fellow, but we weren't exactly mates yet. \"No.\" He mustered faintly. I was about to back away, figuring he wanted to be alone, but he sunk his face into my shoulder, and started to sob. I could generally settle small arguments on my own, but a full-blown crying man on my shoulder was a tad out of my area of expertise. And I still don't know why I came to see Simon. I ruffled his hair and started to smooth it down like I would do for my baby cousins when I wanted them to calm down. Then I looked at Carl, my eyes wide with fear. I tried to convey my panic at this situation, but he gave me a half hazard side-face grin, and two thumbs up. Sure, maybe I looked like I was doing fine, but c'mon. We—excuse me, I —managed to get him to stop crying, and talk. He told me how he'd met this lovely lady, who he was sure was the one. They were going to spend the rest of their lives together… or so he thought. Simon, probably the most innocent grown man I've ever encountered, was played for a fool. She married him to be on the boat to be with Gavin. That swine . That whole time he knew what she was there to do, and he never said a thing. That's just as bad as if he suggested she do it. But as bad of a part that Gavin played, Eleanor was way up there in my bad books now. That blonde I saw this morning, which, now that I think of it, was probably only sad that she lost Gavin, deserved to be kicked off. I'm only sad that I probably won't be the one to kill the instigator, Gavin, since Count staked his claim, and Simon was too big a softie. Simon finally took his head off my shoulder, and I looked down to see that my gray sweater was now damp with salty tears. \"It's okay Simon, you don't need people like her in your life.\" I said, patting his back, indicating we should get up. I had been paying avid attention Simon, so much so, that Carl slipped my mind. He was on the floor, sleeping. I nudged his pale face with the toe of my shoe, and he woke with a start. \"C'mon.\" I said. He followed, and stretched lethargically. We decided to join the rest of the gang, who were in the lounge, divided into two obvious cliques. There was Gavin sitting with Mark and Dave, while Angus, Kevin, Felicity, Count, News John, and Harold sat to the other side. Then there was my crew, huddled tightly still. The two Radio Rock groups had one thing in common; they were sizing up the comrades formerly known as Pop Wave. As soon as we walked in, everyone looked up, expressions varying. I could tell Jackie was angry that I was away, but mostly people wondering why we were with Simon, I'm sure. Hey, I have to keep informed. \"Hello, all.\" I addressed, since there was no way I could get Carl or Simon to speak. \"Well, now that we're all here, we can examine the situation.\" Quentin began brightly. \"And ponder why Meryl would have brought other people with her.\" I looked around, trying to appear nonchalant about it. I'd let Jackie handle this one. \"Well, technically only I needed to come with her, but the rest of my girls are here for… support .\" Jackie boasted. \"Why? We're only doing one show.\" Dave stated. The Count waved his hand around a bit. \"No, no,\" Everyone looked at him expectantly, \"they're looking for a bargain.\" I could hear Gavin snort very loudly cigarette smoke out his nose. \"How very unbecoming. Gavin making pig sounds.\" I commented low enough for it to sound like I was thinking aloud, but loud enough for a couple sniggers. \"So you're suggesting we let you stay here to perform alongside us?\" Gavin said with disgust after sneering at me. \"And why not? After all, we did decide to not say what you did and press charges for attempted homicide when you sunk our boat.\" Jackie crafted. It certainly was a stretch, considering we did alert authorities. But no one had to know that. \"No, the deal was for only one show with Meryl, complete with full-on humiliation.\" Gavin said while laughing at us. Everyone ignored him. \"This could be beneficial for ratings. That would be yet another kick in the nuts for the British government.\" Quentin mused. \"They're staying here?\" Kavanagh asked, sounding panicky. I believe he must have expected his crew to back him up, but there was no respect left for him at the moment. Count laughed at his discomfort, while Dave spoke, \"They're staying here.\" Dave was probably excited to get his hands on a woman. I'm not surprised. \"I'm not sharing my air time with a bunch of overrated radio broads.\" \"I thought this was what you wanted.\" I said to him with fake curiosity. \"The deal was—\" he started. \"I don't think you're in a position to argue.\" Count said. Everyone else's disapproving stares were proof. \"Besides, Gavin, we'll have loads of fun. After all, there's no need to be so uptight about it. What would the listeners think; Gavin not game?\" I suggested. I just egged him on; guys are way too competitive. Later, when everyone was set up with a room—some people had to share, and Quentin made the boys move in together for the time being— and the matter was partially settled, we decided to find out later how long we would be staying. I went up on deck to get some space, but my good friend Carl was already there. \"Hullo.\" I said, coming beside him. \"Hi.\" He lowered his head onto the railing on top of his folded hands. \"So that sure was something, eh?\" \"Yeah, you guys staying here.\" \"I was thinking more about Simon. Poor lad.\" \"You really need to stop acting like that.\" \"What?\" I defended. \" Lad . Like you're old. Because you're not.\" \"I never said I was, Carl.\" We were kind of lightly arguing, but the matter obviously bothered him. \"Well you're not. You're my age. Maybe younger.\" \"Girls mature faster than boys. This boat is kind of living proof of that.\" I said jokingly. \"So.\" \"What brought this on?\" \"There're forty year old men on board. Sure they're fun, but...\" You're way out of your depth, Carl. I snorted, and dropped my head into my hands. This was just too funny. \"And you're saying this because?\" \"Simon will be alright.\" Carl said softly, aware that he might've took a step too far with this 'argument'. He immediately switched topics to my previous issue, since I clearly won. \"Good.\" I said quietly also, and we just stood relaxing for a moment. I still didn't understand what exactly he was trying to say. \"Well, I'm going inside now. By the way, Count is supposed to be on air soon, for some big announcement to challenge Gavin. Should be interesting.\" He slowly turned around, and as his invitation, he beckoned with his head in the direction he was going. \"I might as well. It's not like I'm going anywhere.\" In his studio, Count sat in his swivel chair, and was thrumming his fingers on his desk, waiting for the jingle to finish from News John's reports. He waited three beats before booming his American accent over the air, \"My dear listeners, you may have noticed a certain cooling of the relationship between his royal highness, the Count of Cool, and a guy called Gavin. Well, I am eager to show the world that he is a coward. So I'm suggesting something that's pretty big where I come from, and it's a game called Chicken!\" He started to crow like a chicken, mocking Gavin through the glass, since he was there, subjected to watch. \"We will let you know how that goes, tomorrow, when your very own Count comes back on the air, victorious.\" \"Alright everyone, let's take this show outside.\" Dave announced, procuring a megaphone from somewhere. I'd learn to stop asking questions in time, I guess. Outside on the deck, I wasn't sure what was going to happen. Of course Count had tried to explain the game well enough, but he mostly told everyone to watch. \"The man who climbs furthest is the victor!\" Dave exclaimed. Count and Gavin stood of either side of the boat's antenna. \"May the best man win… and the biggest chicken lose!\" They readied to climb, placing their feet on the first bars. \"Are we ready?\" Gavin and Count both put out their cigarettes, \"Then let the ascent commence!\" The two men began to climb quickly, and instantly everyone started to cheer for Count. Soon I caught myself practically roaring like everyone else, cheering for Count, but I reserved myself a bit, opting to clap. I would occasionally glance over at Simon, who wasn't making a sound, but you could see the determination in his face, wanting with all of his might for Count to win. Nearly halfway to the top, they were neck and neck, but Count lost his footing. I recoiled at bit, along with everyone else, voicing our awe; Count was a little ways away from being a pancake on the deck. He held on for his life though, but gave Gavin the lead. I only felt disappointed that I couldn't hear them discuss while Count regained his footing. Radio Rock began to yell at them to stop, and get back down. \"Come on guys, don't be stupid!\" Dave spoke through the megaphone. \"Enough is enough, you made your point!\" However, they resumed their climb. \"Quentin, do something!\" Felicity begged. He rolled his head and muttered a profanity before gaining the nerve to tell two grown men, \"For god's sake, STOP!\" I was almost saddened that neither of them gave the impression of giving up. While all of us were still busy watching the climbing DJ's, I could hear Quentin senselessly say, \"All he did was have sex with someone's wife… Sorry Simon, nothing personal…\" That awkward moment was almost funny because it was Quentin, but still too soon to make light of, and you could see the glare coming off of Simon's face. \"If you fall, you will die!\" Dave tried. \"Oh my god.\" They were approaching the top, and both weren't making their way down anytime soon. Finally, they sat atop the perpendicular beams, resting in place, talking from what I could see. They swivelled their heads in both directions, and I had a very frightening thought. They wouldn't do that would they? Wahhh sorry this is sooo late :( Please review anyways… -sage94[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Humility I watched as they eased to either sides of the mast, my tummy filled with butterflies for them. \"Step away from the edge, you silly bastards, this is madness!\" Dave shouted. Everyone voiced his or her protests as well. They were stopped and finally the rest of us realized they were going to jump. \"What do you say now?\" Count shouted from high above. \"I say, I know a chicken when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now! Adios amigo!\" Suddenly, Gavin lunged off the beam, falling towards the water. With a tall and sickeningly loud splash he landed in the sea. I found myself running to the side of the boat, waiting for him to resurface. My stomach threatened to drop to the floor, I was so nervous. His wake hit the boat, and he had still not resurfaced. The bubbles where he landed were beginning to dissipate, when his blond head poked out of the water's surface. I was relieved for a moment, until I heard the anticipated yell and splash of Count. I had been so focused on one of the DJ's dying I forgot about the other one. Everyone was scrambling to get them back on the boat, while I anxiously wondered if it was possible to be killed from that fall. It was when they got a good look of Gavin's limp body that I did think that I was indeed possible. A life preserver was thrown at each of the men, as they bobbed over the waves, trying to get their senses back. I sat in the lounge on stairs with Simon by my side, as Felicity took it upon herself to tape them up as best as she could. They repeatedly refused to be taken ashore. But what they did insist on was some airtime. Until much later that evening, when they were given the 'okay' to move, they wobbled to the disc jockey's workspaces. The Count and Gavin sat in their seats, taking to the air. News John introduced them back on, and Count began, with a pause for reflection. \"Ladies and gentlemen of Great Britain, Abraham Lincoln once said it is a measure of a man that he can admit when he's wronged. And I have been catastrophically wrong.\" Count passed it on to Gavin, in the studio adjacent to him. Gavin rasped, \"I'd also like to take this opportunity to apologize to a dear friend of mine. Simon.\" I observed from the doorway how Simon's face tried not to give away too much satisfaction, but his joy of bring recognized and announced on Gavin's behalf put a small smile on his face. \"Finally, everything on board is gonna be just…fine.\" He winked at me, and my face twisted of its own accord at my confused feelings. I want to be mad, but the circumstances permit otherwise. When Simon came my way, I halted him, \"Just like that?\" I was genuinely curious. He scratched the back of his innocent little head nervously. He knew I expected more, but I could tell he wanted this all to be over. \"Well…\" I looked past him to Gavin, who paid no mind to us as he placed the headphones back in their proper place. I pursed my lips. Why couldn't I let go of simple things like Simon? \"Oh all right, you big oaf. Just don't go expecting a changed man over there.\" I said, motioning to Gavin good-naturedly. I ruffled his hair for effect, and shoved him playfully as I could, given my feelings. Though, I took pleasure in seeing Gavin limping around the ship. Once this small drama had passed, the talking had quickly switched to my crew getting some airtime. So naturally, the next day, they had set me up with a pair of headphones at Dave's desk. It still bugged me though how everything was quickly forgotten. Jackie pulled me to the side, a moment before I was about to step inside the studio. \"You can't let them win.\" She smirked at me knowingly, since I would be decent in my element. \"Go on, steal the show.\" She shooed me away by smacking my back, and I hurried back into the studio, adjusting my mike. All was quiet on the boat, and everyone observed us both, expressions ranging from amused to knowing, to cringing. Mr. Kavanagh took his starting dramatic breath and began: \"Good evening, ladies and gents, and you're back with Gavin on Radio Rock, 203 meters on the medium waveband.\" Gavin said smoothly. \"Now as promised not to long ago, we were to have a special guest, with none other than Pop Wave's Meryl. And she has so graciously joined us to tell us about her first visit with us that happened not too long ago.\" \"Thanks Gav, and welcome to the first ever partnership between Radio Rock and Pop Wave!\" I started. At my words, Gavin whipped his head to me; I could see surprise on his face, even through his sunglasses. \"That was Meryl, everyone, come to join us in the studios. And we will certainly introduce her, shortly after these messages, and the Kinks.\" He turned on the advertisements and song, and then I could see him glare at me. \"This is still my show.\" He announced, once he turned his mike off. \"Not while I'm here. The stakes are high, and I'm not letting you feed me to the sharks.\" I justified. \"Wanker.\" I muttered. \"From now on if you have something to say…don't.\" He said calmly, gaining more than a couple chuckles than I was comfortable. \"Would someone get a crown for this princess?\" I cooed. \"You're in my studio. Sure I wanted you here, but you can't go announcing this as collaboration show time. No, this is supposed to be defeat.\" He poignantly dropped his fist to the table. \"But that's not very fun.\" I feigned hurt. \"Besides, didn't Quentin agree this was a collab?\" \"I said, we'll see!\" Quentin shouted. \"Listen girly, we'll be back on air in a few, and I don't want any babbling out of turn.\" Gavin said. \"So this is practical Gavin.\" \"Shut up.\" He snapped. \"Paedophile.\" \"Bitch.\" \"Skank.\" \"Oh, because you're a saint?\" \"Herpes.\" \"I've had no such thing.\" He was really offended but tried not to show it; I almost dropped my serious mockery and sniggered, but held back. \"Is that a cold sore?\" I asked, leaning forward with pretend disgust and curiosity. He raised his hand to his mouth, but stopped himself. \"Alright, that's it. Get that thing out of my studio.\" Gavin stood. \"Unfortunately for you, I'm in Dave's studio, and I'll be in here, as long as he'll have me.\" Dave looked apologetically at Gavin, shrugged and said, \"Sorry mate.\" \"With that being said, I'd like to point out that you two will make charming for radio.\" Quentin said, opening the door to our adjacent studios. \"My apologies, Quinn.\" I offered. \"Claws down.\" He warned me. I thought about that, and figured acting tame would last about a couple minutes. \"They'll love this sort of thing Radio Rock is doing. After all, I heard you guys aren't doing too well either.\" I tut-ted for effect. \"I just want this over with soon, so that this will all be back to normal.\" \"We'll see what Quentin says.\" I threatened. I knew from the first suggestion by Quentin himself that we would be a hit. Gavin and I just had a bit of clashing egos. I saw Gavin take another one of his dramatic pauses for a raspy entrance, and took the chance for myself, \"And you're back with me and Gav.\" He clenched his fist, and took a deep breath. \"That's right. Now before our short break, for those of you just tuning in, I have Meryl with me, the one and only from Pop Wave. She, along with a few friends are going to…\" He had a really short pause, where he was at a loss for words. I could see for a fraction of a second, how he wasn't sure what to say. \"Be airing a couple of shows with them.\" I tried. \"As you know, Pop Wave isn't up and running at the moment, due to some very minor setbacks caused by totally unforeseeable forces.\" I gave the stank eye to Radio Rock on the sidelines. \"So the pirates have ever so graciously agreed to help get us back on our feet. Who would've thought they'd be such thoughtful lads, eh?\" In effort to regain some composure and control, Gavin piped back in, \"With that explained, Meryl, why don't you tell the rest of Britain how we came to meet?\" I chuckled, not quite sure how to moderate this. \"Well, it certainly wasn't normal. I didn't just go up and introduce myself.\" \"Yes, yes, get to the good parts.\" Gavin hurried me, very excited indeed. \"I—\" I looked down at my lap, anticipating any and all embarrassment, \"I snuck onto the ship.\" There was a pause, partially for shock, the rest for humour. \"Well that's certainly not the version I was told.\" Gavin said, leaning in. \"It's the truth.\" \"And may you tell us why you would do that? Not jealousy, I hope.\" \"I wanted to… spy on the pirates.\" I tapped my foot. That was the thing about being a disc jockey: you could never really tell what other people were thinking, not without an audience in front of you. \"So when I went to leave, I injured myself, rendering myself incapable of leaving.\" Gavin was grinning his ass off. \"And how did you get onto the boat?\" \"Icamewiththecontestwinners.\" I mumbled. \"I'm sorry?\" I cleared my throat, \"Back when you held the contest for a chance to come and visit, I felt compelled this would have been the opportune moment. But as we all know karma is not the nicest of things.\" \"Luck was never on your side.\" \"Thank you, Gavin!\" I exclaimed falsely. \"And I understand that during your stay, your sister, Marlow, the supermodel came to pay a visit.\" \"Whore.\" I said subtly through coughs. I knew not a lot of people could have heard that. \"After the break, let's have a nice chat about her, why don't we?\" He flicked on the Beatles, and turned off his mike, \"You know, you should really fix that cold of yours.\" \"Shut up.\" I stuck out my tongue. Much, much later, the segment of my embarrassment ended, with my dignity all scraped up. I explained as much as I could without dishonouring Radio Rock for some reason; I didn't tell a thing about what they did our ship, lest it hurt a bit of their fan base. I suppose it's a sort of way of helping them. Well, not only that, I wasn't about to rat out my only source of being on air. It might be rude to call them a stepping-stone. \"That wasn't so bad.\" Molly said unconvincingly. \"Right.\" Justice rolled her eyes, and patted to the open seat on the couch to her right. I sat. \"It was terrible, wasn't it?\" I asked, leaning into Justice's shoulder. \"Yeah.\" They both said honestly. \"That even hurt me .\" Justice said. She knew she was tough, so this was saying something. \"We sounded pathetic.\" Gavin waltzed into the lounge where we were sitting, off to the kitchen, but stopped to comment, \"Quentin's right; you make lovely for radio.\" \"Get back to the kitchen.\" I quipped, and folded my arms across my chest. Though we both knew that stung me. Felicity came by with a tray of snacks, and set it on the coffee table. She looked at me sympathetically. \"Simon's looking for one of you to fill in with him tomorrow, just for some fun.\" She looked pointedly at me, which I figured would make me feel better, since I knew Simon was a gent. \"Yus.\" I said, the moment Felicity left. I was savvy enough to know Simon was the most polite of them all, aside from Carl, but he was never on air. But then I started to think about Bob. Would it be a \"breach of contract\" if I wanted to be on air with him? I mean, sure I would hate to be on that late, but if it meant not listening to Kavanagh all day, I might actually survive. So I approached Quentin. \"Hey.\" \"What do you want?\" it wasn't mean the way he said it, just to the point. \"No one exactly said anything about who I had to broadcast with, right?\" I gave the cutest grin I could muster, but I could only picture myself looking like the Cheshire cat on ecstasy. \"Your point?\" \"Well, I was thinking…\" \"Oh lord.\" \"…That maybe if Bob didn't mind, I could broadcast with him.\" It sounded like a question, not like I was hoping. His eyebrows raised a little, incredulity radiating off him. \"You can't hide for long. But we'll see.\" I knew instantly he wasn't out to get me, like some of the others, to see me, but he knew he had some sort of duty to his crew. \"We'll let you for a while, but I want to see how your first show affected the ratings.\" For the next days, I'd spent nice quiet early mornings down in Bob's humble abode, picking out music for him, and only introducing certain songs, since it was relatively silent. And I had some trouble getting a calm radio voice. I wasn't one to lull people to sleep. \"Hey Bob, how did you get into radio?\" I asked one night, while a particularly gloomy song was playing. Only a few days had passed since I'd been on the radio, and from that time I only made a bit more slightly successful broadcasts alongside Gavin, Angus and Simon. \"What? Oh…\" He was deep in thought, \"Well, I only started my job here a little under a year ago. I mean, I worked a little for one other station, but I've—this is still pretty new.\" \"Bob, Bob. I'm not your mother. I'm not twelve. It's okay, don't hold out on me.\" I reassured him, and was about to listen, but I remembered something about the jeans I was wearing. \"I'll tell you what Bob. I only pull these out on extra special occasions.\" I pulled it out of my small front pocket, and unrolled the gum wrapper that encased it, and then pulled out my lighter. I lit it and took a toke, and then handed it off to Bob's tentative hands. \"Come on, a guy like you? Not trying?\" I knew he'd definitely tried before. It was this stupid age barrier. Before he knew it, he was talking away. \"You fucking stud.\" I said, after a while, he told me about his sexual endeavours, but sort of keeping it appropriate. He chuckled, and leaned back into his chair and quickly introduced another song, before coming back to our conversation, \"So that was about the time when I was nineteen.\" \"And after that?\" \"Well I tried that whole settle down for a bit in my thirties.\" \"And how'd that work out?\" \"Three divorced wives and five children.\" I sucked in air, with disapproval, \"Oh, Bob!\" But I was a bit surprised. \"Is that all?\" He counted with both his hands, and I could tell he really didn't know. \"Anyways, so you came to be on this ship how ?\" \"Well I met Quentin back in the day, we were still both young. Well not you young, but I still had my hair trimmed, and we had managed to get out of the war alive. Christ, we were barmy, Meryl. Quentin still can't remember anything from the forties.\" \"So he got you a slot?\" I leaned up a bit. \"He wanted on the clock hours, and called me up from… Cor, where was I?\" He didn't ponder for long, seeming to accept that he probably would never remember, \"But he gave me a ring and said he needed a guy for the early, early mornings.\" \"And now you're stuck here with the biggest blokes in all of the world.\" \"Wouldn't change a thing. The music makes all the difference.\" \"Ah, but before…those must have been the days.\" I said, and went to lie on the comfortable carpeted floor. \"No.\" He said soberly and cleared his throat. \"What's that?\" I asked lazily. \"Today's good. The kids. The music.\" \"Nah, I'm pretty fucked.\" I said, settling my hands under my head, and propping my feet up on the chair he was sitting on. \"You don't give yourself any credit.\" He finished off the blunt, and handed back the roach. \"My whole life I've been called selfish. And irresponsible.\" \"But free.\" He said wistfully. It scared me how he was so deep. He's probably so used to talking when he's like this. \"Bob. How old are you?\" I asked. \"Fifty-two.\" Yep, lots of experience. \"Huh…\" I shrugged, \"You know, you're alright.\" I stayed awake with him until the sun rose, and I dozed a bit. In the morning, Bob went off to bed, where I knew it was probably quiet. But me, on the other hand, with Simon's booming voice, I couldn't get to sleep, so I fought my body to get to the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee. Normally I didn't drink coffee either, but I hear it helps. And I've been doing a lot of things I wouldn't normally do anyways. \"I don't know anyone who would go to bed that early to wake up for this like Simon.\" I said, turning Simon's voice down on the radio in the lounge. I face planted into Molly's shoulder. \"When's the last time you saw your mum?\" She joked. \" My mum is probably better off thinking she has one child. The pretty one. With the successful modelling career.\" I said, letting my tiredness get the better of me. \"Pretty indeed.\" Gavin jabbed, but it had become the norm for everyone to poke fun at each other. \"Speaking of your Mum, Ferguson, she sent in a very lovely worded letter. It's for you.\" Quentin said, holding a prim envelope, with the top ajar. \"You read it?\" \"Oops.\" He said, handed me a letter, and strode away. When I read it, I couldn't be more surprised at the content. Typical fawning mother, though I wasn't on the receiving end of that affection. This was just perfect for an early morning. Sorry I haven't updated in a while. I had a hectic summer job :P BUT PLEASE REVIEW it warms my heart… -Sage94[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: Awe, Rats Dear Meryl, I was very pleased to hear your voice over the radio. It brought me great pleasure to know that you supported your sister's accomplishments for once. I'm sure she also appreciated the nod. Personally, she should get her own interview, but my dear, you're very much capable of filling her place, though not the first choice. I'm just glad you've gotten yourself onto a more popular ship, no pun intended. Pop Wave just wasn't as successful as you deserve anyways. Nevertheless I should enjoy seeing you and your sister very soon, maybe the New Year? If her busy schedule permits. Ciao, from your loving mother, Caroline Forget I shivered in disgust. For one, of course it had everything to do with Marlow, second, not once did she ask me any personal questions about my well-being (not that that was something I had come to expect), and thirdly, I could just picture her saying her maiden name in that ridiculous phony French accent she had \"acquired\" while Marlow had taken her on a trip to France for a runway show. \"Vomit-worthy?\" Molly asked sympathetically. \"Nevermind vomiting.\" I said quietly (while thinking of much worse reactions worthy of this), just to Molly and Justice, and handed it off for them to read. \"Ouch.\" Justice was the faster reader. \"Thanks for this Quentin.\" I mumbled to him, and he gave a smug smirk and a nod in return, before going back to his office. \"Uh, girls, we're about to have a quick game of football, care to watch?\" Harold asked nervously, very aware he was interrupting a moment. But I didn't mind. \"Screw watching.\" Justice said, leaping up to get to the deck. Again, I can't be offended by her offhandedness about my issues, when she's a very strong person with an equally strong sense of what's right and wrong. \"Sorry to hear about that, Mer.\" Molly said about the letter, and followed Justice upstairs, though she wasn't as enthusiastic about sports like Justice. \"Sure thing, Harold.\" I assured him, and strolled upstairs with him. Watching them play together was perhaps more fun than participating. It's not that I wasn't good a sports, I just never liked them much. So this was all in Justice's area of expertise, being a competitive player before she joined radio and dropped out of university. Sure enough, with these pale and gangly boys tripping around on deck, football didn't last long. \"Everyone, this is our last ball so please be careful!\" Angus stressed. \"Kevin, you're kicker.\" As expected, somehow Kevin buggered up by kicking the ball overboard for the second time, and everyone rounded on him. And tried to strip him. Which was odd. It was a lazy day, and the lot of us hadn't much to do. Molly was talking quietly about her airtime with Mark, and then about other things with him I'd rather not have heard. And since the boys started to get rather boring, Molly thought up the lovely idea of sunbathing in front of them. I decided not to have fun with that, by choosing to remain mostly clothed in a long shirt and shorts, but I did encourage it, since my friends had a certain effect on the men, who were equally as eager to bathe in the sun. Molly and Justice were put further on display, since we were on the upper deck overlooking them, and waving flirty and all. \"Don't do that to them unless you're going to actually sleep with them.\" I warned, while looking at one of Felicity's magazines. I wasn't one for the clothing and all, but I did like to keep an eye on my favourite bands. \"Oh, fuck.\" I said suddenly, dropping the magazine. \"What's wrong?\" Molly said, picking up the magazine. \"She's on the best dressed list.\" I muttered disgustedly. \"Let's just get…get rid of that.\" Justice threw it away. \"Say, Meryl, are you sure you and your sister aren't on speaking terms?\" Dave said from below. He was looking at the magazine that Justice had tossed down. There was just no escaping Marlow's shadow. Her smile graced the pages of the magazine where it was thrown face-up. In attempts to get sports back into their schedule, the pirates tried to round up a game of basketball with everyone against Count, minus us on the upper deck, who observed and cheered with amusement. Jackie and the other girls were inside, probably relaxing, finding the rest of us very tiresome; only Thelma came out to join us. I eventually left my friends to join Carl down on the lower deck, myself being slightly more confident around the guys. \"You sure that throwing him in is the best way of getting' him to learn how to swim?\" Dave asked, as him and Count swung Angus by his wrists and ankles, intending to throw him overboard. \"Absolutely.\" Count confirmed, \"Okay.\" And with that, Angus was wailing pathetically through the air, and making feeble attempts at staying afloat. \"Ah!\" He squealed like a dying kitty. \"You know, on second thought, that might be just for kids.\" Count said, not at all worried for the man below. \"I can't touch the bottom.\" I shook my head and leaned over the rail to look down on him. \"Yeah, that's right, throw a baby in, it floats. Instinctively natural. It's a beautiful thing.\" Count said matter-of-factly. \"I think if you throw in an adult… doesn't work that way.\" \"Care to join him? I mean you probably have the best experience swimming.\" Dave offered to me, recalling my last trip in the water. \"Someone's gotta get him back up.\" And he could've just asked if he wanted to see me in a bathing suit. I took off my shirt and shorts, and jumped into the cold waters. I dragged the Nut back to the boat, where the ladder was and he cleared his throat. \"Erm, thanks.\" He said quietly. Obviously he didn't like that he had to be saved. Later that night, everyone had settled down, and we went to sit under the stars for a drink and a little circle to… get to know each other better. \"Deprivation.\" Dave said. Everyone agreed it would be the game to play, as it was pretty well shocking. \"Not us,\" Justice said and giggled, and then stood, leaving me to sit beside Angus, with Thick Kevin to my right. \"I've had a bit too much to drink to let you fool me into playing.\" Molly added, and they strolled drunkenly inside. I could tell she had almost everyone's eyes trailing after her. She did happen to dress very immodestly while intoxicated. Then I thought to the women already inside; I couldn't understand how Jackie couldn't be having the time of her life here, since this was her element, apart from the men. I mean; even Quentin wasn't out here to irk her. Count started us off, \"Umm, okay, I got you limeys beat: I have never had a sexual dream featuring a member of the royal family. Raise your hand if you have been as equally deprived.\" \"Princess Margaret.\" Everyone naturally agreed. \"Prince Charles,\" I added. He wasn't the best looking fellow, but dreams are fucked up anyways. \"Well done, full house.\" Dave said. Everyone congratulated him on a good pick. \"Felicity.\" Dave said, so she got to pick the next one. \"I have never had sex with a man.\" She stated, giving little thought. When she saw there wasn't much response, she said, \"Oh, I didn't think that was a very good one…\" I didn't think it very good either, until I saw that Angus beside me didn't raise his hand. He growled in defeat. He gained a laugh from us all, \"Tell us!\" \"Damnit.\" He said. \"Sorry.\" Felicity apologized. \"Uh, okay.\" He took a deep breath, aware of his 'shame', \"It was at school, obviously. Who hasn't, eh?\" \"Uh, me.\" Most of the boys chorused. \"Okay, except you guys. It was just once!\" he tried to appease, \"His name was Jackman.\" \"Of course his name was Jackman.\" Count teased. \"Yeah, you can laugh, but actually he was something of a god.\" \"You know I bet he was.\" Felicity supported sweetly. \"In the Upper Fifth.\" He added, as if it helped his decision. I sort of admired Angus in a weird way. He was a pretty good sport about this all. Even though people mocked him, and he certainly wasn't done being the butt of jokes from here on out, he accepted that. Not with grace, but with a 'let's face it' attitude. \"Sadly, that means you only get one point. One point for Felicity.\" Dave said, the regulator of the game. \"Meryl?\" I looked around when Count spoke. Then with stunning realization it found it was I; I had my hand raised. Everyone was looking at me. \"What?\" I asked and shifted uncomfortably in my seat, while lowering my arm. \"Do tell.\" Dave said, leaning in closer. \"Is there a problem if I haven't?\" I asked, though not too concerned about it. \"And don't look at me like that!\" I pushed Angus's shoulder, but wished I had a curtain surrounding me. \"Besides, I only just turned eighteen.\" I received a lot of disapproving stares, and shaking of the heads. \"No shame in celibacy.\" I wasn't sure who said that, for giggles followed, making hardly possible to figure it out, but I slapped my face with my palm anyways. \"Right.\" Count rolled his eyes at the previous comment. \"Alright everyone, next question!\" I hurried it along, trying to get attention past me. I tried to ignore the random glances I'd get, most of them confused. To be honest, I was also surprised I hadn't lost it by now. It was then Gavin's turn, and his started out rather odd: \"Right, bit of a strange one, this. I've never been on a date with a girl—\" People started to laugh. \"Wait, wait!\" Everyone shut up. \"And after sex, thought she wouldn't notice if I let go a bit of wind. Did so, and realized it wasn't wind… It was diarrhea.\" \"Yuck.\" I groaned. That was way more embarrassing than my story, I thought for sure people would forget about it. \"So I've never been in bed with the girl of my dreams with poo all over the sheets behind me. Raise your hands, anyone who has not done that.\" \"No way.\" Angus said, also glad attention was off him. I looked around after I raised my hand; this story sounded awfully specific and slandering. The only defeated person left, without their hand raised was Dave. The remorse I tried to show in my laugh didn't seem to make Dave feel any better. \"Yoouuu bastard, man.\" He accused. \"What? I didn't tell anyone.\" Gavin said defensively, but very much guilty. \"You did that?\" Carl asked Dave. \"Yeah…\" He replied painfully. \"What did you do?\" \"Well I told her that my wife would be home in five minutes… So she left.\" \"So you got away with it.\" \"It's a grey area…\" Dave squirmed. \"Tell em',\" Gavin egged on, and was on the edge of his seat, causing the rest of us to do so. \"The problem being that my wife then came home…\" I was laughing my arse off, \"and I got into quite a lot of trouble for pooing in the bed… at four o'clock in the afternoon.\" Laughter echoed over the waters, and we probably woke up anyone inside. Everyone had his or her turn, and I was the last to go, \"Meryl, dying to hear your turn.\" Dave said, still unhappy. \"I haven't quite got a good one.\" I thought out loud. \"Felicity stole mine…\" I received quite a bit of laughter, \"hmm, how about… I have never finished school.\" I didn't expect that one to be very good, but I was always interested to know who was educated or not. Dave, Count and Kevin's hands weren't raised, and my attention was whipped to Kevin immediately. \"Primary doesn't count, Kev.\" Carl said, and I was glad he said it before I did. \"Oh, right.\" He raised his hand. The next day at lunch, I was on my way to visit with Simon, when Gavin stopped me in the hall. He had this outraged expression, and a very disbelieved air about him. I knew what he was here to talk about. Sorry Carl . I winced before Gavin began, since he wasn't here to listen to my apology. Maybe Carl lost a couple respect points for last night. \"You didn't sleep with Carl?\" He asked. \"I should have just kept my hand down.\" I muttered. \"What were you two doing?\" Gavin asked suspiciously. \"Christ.\" I sunk into the wall. \"Nothing, okay? It was just for fun, we were playing cards.\" \"But why pretend?\" \"I don't have to explain anything to you.\" I said sternly, while crossing my arms. \"Now that statement leaves a lot to be assumed.\" \"Shut up. It's because my effing sister came here, alright?\" \"Jealousy?\" Gavin suggested knowingly, and leaned in. \"It's not jealousy. It's that if you're going to piss me off by getting with my sister—Oh come on, don't say you weren't angry when I pretend-slept with Carl.\" \"I was angrier when I thought you had the guts to do it. Now I know you don't have it in you.\" He said smugly. \"Hey, that's not a fair. Maybe you must have been glad to be rid of yours when you were young, because you were too insecure to find a girl to stay with longer than five minutes, but not me. But hey, that must have been quite some time ago for you.\" He took a deep breath. \"Still.\" I could tell he held back an angry tone. \"This boat doesn't exactly spell romantic. I'm living on a boat full of imbeciles.\" \"Ouch. That's not something nice to say about Carl.\" \"Still.\" I said pointedly, going back to my previous assertion. \"Plenty of time to change your mind. If not Carl, then there's rest of us, eh luv? Not one catches your eye yet?\" He asked, stepping closer. \"Oh, you pig.\" I said, and pushed him away with a roll of my eyes. I sat in the studio the next morning with Simon, preparing for hit chart show. Gavin had been giving me the silent treatment after yesterday, which probably made me feel worse, since I didn't have to be on air that day either. During his show, Simon was happy as usual, and I probably sounded stoned, since I hadn't fully awakened, but he managed to get my spirits going with his cute antics. \"And this next song by the Rolling Stones, is a particular favourite. Sing along if you know how it goes,\" I turned on the record, and Get off of my Cloud came on. I started to dance in the studio getting Simon in his to move a bit. I wouldn't say I'm a dancer at all, but I do have a habit of making people catch onto it. I'd like to think that maybe people felt better about dancing around me, because they knew they had to be at least a little better at dancing. By the end, I received a nice applause from Harold and Kevin sitting in the background. I gave a courteous bow to them, but hesitated when I saw Gavin skulking in the back, behind the couches, and by the exit, his arrogant chin jutted. Jutted, like he normally was, but in his odd way, reserved. He seemed perturbed by either me, or the air. I didn't like to think it was me, I'm not too vain... I think. We passed off the show to Dave, and I walked out to approach him. \"What do you want?\" I asked, but very politely, though he knew I wanted to be rude. \"Got a bit of news for you two. There's a team meeting in the lounge area regarding the ratings.\" I gave Simon our traditional high-five for after every show, and we followed Gavin back to the lounge. \"Alright, everyone, quiet down. Some very good news. All of our listeners have been tuning in, and we even gained some others with the arrival of Meryl and her lot.\" He bowed to us, \"Now, we tried out more than a few combinations for the broadcasting, and I have the list for pairings, based on how you were rated with each other. We not only took polls from the advertisers, but also the very crucial opinion of the listeners.\" I immediately ripped the page out of his hands, very anxious to know how Simon and me did. I liked being around that guy. I didn't feel like I was constantly going to be insulted into oblivion. With careful and hopeful eyes, I searched, but on paper, this wasn't the case. I rolled my eyes, and handed it off to Thelma, who was standing anxiously next to me. She had been paired up with Dave for most of the week. \"Oh, Dave, we did wonderfully!\" She exclaimed, and ran to his side, bouncing on the spot. Dave was also as enthusiastic, because she wore particularly low-cut shirts, and they got along well enough. \"And here are some of the reviews sent in by some of the Radio Rock fans.\" Jackie said, and emptied a large canvas sac onto the floor, creating a pile of envelopes. Justice took a look at it, and raised an eyebrow, when the pairing of choice for her was the Count. At least her partner was bearable. \"What about Bob and Simon? Didn't we get on well?\" I asked Quentin. \"Advertisers say they liked the… animosity you two brought to the table. They used the word 'refreshing.'\" \"Well they can suck my refresh—\" I stopped my muttering, and thought about how this wasn't all bad. \"This doesn't mean I have to stick with him, right?\" \"Certainly not. Bob still has an opening.\" I sighed in relief. \"Unfortunately, you shall have to do both, if we are to upkeep our skyrocketing ratings.\" My sigh was cut short. \"Rats.\" \"Not to worry dear, I'll take good care of you.\" Gavin said, once having read the paper, and saluted me. \"I'll bet you'd like that.\" I grumbled. \"See? I can tell this is going to be a perfect arrangement.\" Quentin said sarcastically. Once everyone had settled into the pairings, I started to read some of the fan mail. \"More of Gavin and Meryl.\" I kept reading over and over. A velvety voice interrupted my inner discussion, \"So shall we get to preparing for the first show together.\" \"Bugger off,\" I said, making it look like I was reading with extra intent. Gavin bent down and picked up a letter from the pile where I discarded all of the ones that had to do with him and me. \"They'd have something to say about that. Come now, be a good sport.\" \"Approach me when you've grown a pair.\" I said, still trying to rifle through the envelopes in hopes of finding something readable, and also trying to look busy. \"In fact I have.\" He began, and I gave him a skeptical stare. \"Would you like to see?\" \"Fuck off.\" I said, and ripped his feathered fedora off of his head, launching it towards the exit. \"Temper.\" He warned, before prancing off like the overly proud buck he was. Wah, sorry this chapter took forever… but um… I was having bad writers block, and then feeling guilty about not exactly keeping up to date with all of my other stories, which do in fact deserve my attention. Because I've only finished one out of the seven I have written. Alas, this, Pirate Radio fanfiction, has captured my concentration, and I'd prefer finishing this one to my others. It's just the brilliance of the film. Was anyone else appalled by the poor ratings of the film? Aaaand how all the awesome scenes are in DELETED SCENES. - anyways, please review, because I've worked extra hard on this chapter, since most of it was under intense scrutiny concerning the content. Love Sage94 ps. Fuck my rambling, sorry… and I swear to get back to normal plot either in this chapter or the next… worst case is in three chapters.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: Sick Of course, things went according to schedule. Basically, everyone was paired, and everyone had airtime, except for Bob, who had airtime, but with whom no one really expressed interest in what with his early timeslot. Unfortunately, Frankie and Angus were also alone, but Frankie chose to keep to herself rather than associate herself, and secretly confided in Jackie and Quentin to get in on behind the scenes, or get in on Bob's airing. So naturally everyone but Angus passed the uncomfortable story around that no one wanted to pair up with him. Poor guy. But the sympathy I feel for him isn't that great, seeing as how if I really didn't want to broadcast with Gavin, then I'd have to go with him, or not broadcast at all. I'm good where I am. When I woke up late one morning after a particularly gripping conversation on air with Gavin about censorship, I saw Simon sitting alone, already done his early morning shift, and sipping his regular tea. \"Hey big fellow, how're you doing?\" I asked, coming to sit beside him none too gracefully, not that I cared. He didn't answer right away, so I could tell he was in one of his moods. \"D'you need to talk about it?\" I asked. \"I'll be okay.\" His unconvincing smile did not prompt me to leave. \"Maybe you're alright with Gavin, but that doesn't mean you're not hurting. I'm going to ask you again: want to talk about it?\" He didn't answer me, but instead rose out of his seat to dispose of his cup and saucer. I could see his profile, which was trying to keep the annoyance out of it. I stared dumbfounded after him, not sure I'd ever been walked out on before. Ever. Count walked by, and double take and I couldn't fix my expression fast enough. He laughed. \"Shut up.\" \"Whatever dude, I was just going to say that that look suits you.\" I glared at him, causing him to skulk away, checking behind him to see if I was coming to beat him. Which I was tempted to do. Later on air, Quentin came in towards the end with a bit of better news while me and Gavin were broadcasting, Just a couple minutes ago, Gavin embarrassed Dave nationally, by telling the poo story; and why should I stop that, it's not like Dave saved my ass anytime recently. \"Yes, unfortunately for the government, they have fallen short with coming up with ways of shutting us down. Meaning, we have more support than ever, if it went to a referendum.\" He said, opening the door, and raising his eyebrows in amazement, still. Of course we had to announce this once the Eagles turned down: \"Yes that was beautiful, and we're back on pubic air. Radio Rock, two-oh-three meters on the medium waveband.\" \"And whatever you do, don't tell Dr. Dave we told you about the infamous poo story.\" I said. \"It's Gavin and Meryl here, and what a year it's been. Government plans to undermine us have failed spectacularly! In fact, says recent poles that ninety-three percent of British people would vote for the Pirates… rather than the government!\" \"This is why!\" I said, putting on 'My Generation'. Quickly, everyone in the studio said their farewells and we signed off. And when the excitement died down, my anticipation didn't. I still had something I wanted to do. I came up nervously to a certain someone's door, and knocked. \"Mark?\" I didn't wait for an answer, since he didn't speak much anyways. I opened the door, and Dave was sitting on his bed, they were clearly hanging out, \"Uh, could I have a word alone with Mark, Doc?\" \"For the lady.\" Dave said over courteously. I waited for the door to close behind him to start. \"I've been thinking about all of this pressure.\" I said timidly, while going further into his cabin. He was writing at his desk, and turned away from the playlist he was creating to look up at me, questioningly seductive, which I'm sure he never knew the full extent of that look. \"And I've also been thinking about how this isn't that worth it. And you know a lot about this kind of thing. So I was going to ask you for a favour…?\" Mark set down his cigarette and pencil, blew out his smoke ever so casually and gestured to the bed. \"Right.\" I muttered. I sat on the edge, not quite sure how to go about this. Mark rose from his seat and sauntered over, and sat beside me. \"And this doesn't have to be a big deal, right?\" I asked, while unbuttoning the top of my shirt. \"Do you want to do this?\" I asked unsure, and paused. He placed a calm hand on my thigh, and said the one word I needed: \"Relax.\" I leaned back into the pillows, and unbuttoned the rest of my shirt, and discarded it. Mark helped me undo my trousers, and they slid off easily. While I was basically naked, Mark still had on his leather trousers. He was holding himself over me, in a plank, ready for the word. His bare chest above me, which before I had never minded at all, had seemed of more importance now. \"How about it—\" His question was cut short by an abrupt knock to the door. \"Oi, you lot, Simon wants to see Caroline.\" \"It's Meryl, Dave.\" I shouted back, the tension between me and Mark now dissipated. \"Could you excuse me?\" I whispered to Mark, pushing him lightly off of me, \"Maybe some other time, eh? Sorry, there's just something I have to take care of with Simon.\" I put on all my clothes, carefully putting in back into place and bolted out the door, very sure I didn't seem like I just almost got laid. \"Is he in his room?\" I asked, keeping the rush out of my voice expertly. \"Yep.\" It took a lot out of me to not jog down the halls to find out what he wanted. \"You rang?\" I asked as nonchalant as possible, after I opened up his door. \"Oh, yeah, you can leave the door open, I won't be long.\" \"Yeah, I was in the middle of something.\" Not that I wanted to exactly get back to it, I just wanted to sound taken. God I sound pathetic in my head. \"Right, I won't keep you.\" He said in his little Irish voice. \"I, uh, just wanted to apologize for earlier.\" \"What of it?\" \"Well, I know I've not been too friendly, and I can't blame everyone around me…\" His sorry attempts at an apology made me pipe in, \"It's alright, Simon. I should've just left you alone.\" I turned away, fully satisfied that he was sorry for before, and that I could still invoke guilt in people. But something happened that I did not expect. He pulled me back by my wrist, and stood, quickly kissing my cheek, I hardly felt it. Something so unexpected, all I could say was, \"What?\" once again today, he left me dumbfounded. \"Oh fiddlesticks.\" He nervously twiddled his thumbs, and pulled away as quickly as he had came. I still stood there, allowing an array of confused looks cross my face. Maybe it looked like I was bipolar, maybe not. \"Yeah, um…\" I left thinking, oh not him too . I quickly left his room, not feeling quite as satisfied as before the peck on the cheek. By the next day, I hadn't really avoided Simon, but I could tell he was avoiding me. I felt sort of ashamed of myself; I must be leading people on somehow. I gotta stop being like that. \"Say Dave, pass the salt.\" I said. We were all eating Saturday supper while Simon was broadcasting the rest of the chart show. \"The lady asked nicely.\" He passed it to me. Molly and Justice were on the other side of the table, suspiciously looking up at me every now and then. I chewed the last of my ham, and dropped my fork with finality. \"Ok, what?\" I asked. They can't have known about Mark already. \"Nothing.\" Molly said nervously. \"We might as well tell her.\" Justice argued. \"Tell me!\" I declared in a very frivolous tone. \"Justice, don't.\" Molly said, as Justice shot a magazine at me that she'd been holding under the table. It landed on its back, over my empty plate. I flipped it over, and sunk my head down, hitting the table. \"The Fergusons get around, don't they?\" Dave said, to my left. I smacked my head a few more times on the table, for further emphasis. My sister graced the cover, on the arm of none other than Mick Jagger. The tabloids drenched the picture with bizarre headings, \"Secret wedding?\" yeah, right. First, she had about as much commitment as my mum and dad. Maybe less than half of that. I maybe saw a new boyfriend every week when we were young. I'll give this fling one other magazine cover. However I perked up a bit after that, because I wanted Gavin to see this too. As if on cue, he arrived late for supper as per usual, and I handed it straight to him. He took it without much thought as to who gave it to him, and read it on the way to an open seat. I could tell from the silence that he was either debating whether to like Mick Jagger, or be mad at my sister, or vice versa. The only problem is, is that he has his darn sunglasses on. \"Oh isn't it just wonderful? Maybe I'll go ashore to visit the family.\" I stated jovially. There was an awkward silence where I thought I'd won, and Felicity brought out a plate for Gavin. He took a long breath of arrogance, and spoke: \"I reminded her time and time again when we were together that once she had me, she'd go more places.\" I held back a scoff of disbelief; he was really trying to play this off (quite well, I suppose). \"Please, like you have anything to do with this.\" \"Er, Meryl,\" Kevin began slowly, \"You don't suppose that you and your sister are fighting still, do you?\" \"Shut up Kev.\" I muttered, but everyone laughed anyways, knowing all to well there was a very slim chance I would set aside any differences soon. \"I suppose we could hold up the ship while you're away.\" Count suggested lightly. \"I said, shut up.\" By the early morning, I had finished a set with Bob, and he was readying to hand it off to Simon. \"Bob, what are your thoughts on this whole Mick Jagger incident?\" I asked him, helping him put his tracks away. \"Sounds to me like you need to pay a visit with your sister.\" I could register a hint of sarcasm. \"Funny.\" \"In some ways, no.\" \"Do tell.\" I said, rolling my eyes, and sitting back down on the couch. \"Well, you have terrible people skills. Who better to sharpen them on than your own flesh and blood?\" \"Gruesome.\" I commented, but did foolishly once upon a time wished my sister would pay attention to me for once. \"And why not be acquainted with your own kin. You play the Stones at least twice a day, so why not give it a shot?\" \"One dinner won't do me any harm.\" I was half-joking because I could never picture myself beside the Stones, along with my sister. Oil and vinegar. \"I'll give it a thought.\" By the time everyone else had rose, most people had heard of the half attempt in Mark's room. Well, it was mainly clear to the people who didn't matter: Count, Gavin, Angus, Quentin and Mark himself. I gained some disapproving stares from Quentin throughout the day, though I don't know why. Several other people had definitely slept with the pirates, though I was somehow the most disappointing for him to hear about. I'm sorry I'm not going to be a saint. Because I was one in every other way? Right. Gavin, though, cornered me before I could get over actually thinking for a moment I would try to lose it to Mark, as skilled as he may be. I was leaning over our collection for some picks for our show; no one else was in the studio yet. I could feel his presence looming behind me. \"What?\" I asked critically, not deviating from my work. \"Why did you choose him?\" he asked in a mock of exasperation. \"Almost.\" I corrected. \"I would be as good as any.\" He reminded. Gavin liked to do that; constantly remind everyone, as the rest of the pirates did, of his sexual prowess. Like everyone would be willing without a thought. \"I had given you a thought.\" I said. I could sense, that though I was turned, he had a triumphant look on his face. \"But then, I probably thought of Dave before you.\" I knew that razzed him. \"You have thought about it before though.\" His voice was then right by my ear, prickling the skin. I gave an involuntary sigh, and fumbled with the tracks on the shelf. I could sense Gavin pause, as if to look around, before returning his breath to the side of my head. Not once did I move, nor was I frozen to the spot. I felt a hand creep to my hip tentatively, and hook itself in my belt loop, straining the trousers downward. I slowly placed my own hand over his, and lowered it. But in my relent, his hand only travelled to my thigh. Inwardly it went, until I gasped, pulling away from the hot breath and lean hands. A grin plastered to his face, and the moment of what I thought was fervour, turned to humiliation as I realized he was not looking down at me, but at the couch behind the glass, where Dave sat, casually giving a clap. I whipped to face Gavin, raised my eyebrow, and punched his arm and picked my things back up, storming to my seat. \"You're sick.\" I instantly regretted moving into the same cubicle at Gavin the week earlier, for cooperation purposes; it was apparently less interesting a show when we were separate. I sat in my seat, the floor having to endure the anger of my toes clenching and my face burning with embarrassment as I waited for the hour to commence. It was going to be a long one. \"Gav?\" I called, hearing Count handing it off from the other studio. \"Eager, are we?\" His smirk sent a shiver by my ear. I clenched my hand in disgust. By the time we were done, it was suppertime and I was glad to be rid of the thoughts that came out of Gavin being in such close proximity. But something odd had happened during that show. I had tried to not let it get to me, but it sounded like he had slipped in a word inappropriate for air. I thought I'd heard—actually I'm not quite sure what I'd heard, but it wasn't his usual crude slander, it was trickier. In fact, the more I thought about it, I realized that all the other DJ's made odd slipups similarly. I'll definitely have to ask. I grabbed a plate of spaghetti from the kitchen, and went to sit at my customary seat, next to Carl. \"How was your day Carl?\" I asked brightly, with a touch of sarcasm. \"Clearly not as good as yours.\" His statement was becoming more of an inquiry. \"I am going mad. It's wonderful.\" I said, just as jovially as before. Dave sat at the table, looking smug, along with Count, who looked like he was trying to hold something in. He just needed a prodding to get the secret out of him, whatever it was, because he was brimming with some sort of challenge. \"Count, what's up?\" I asked. \"Only un défi, as the French would say.\" He said triumphantly. \"What is it?\" Justice said intensely, leaning in over her plate. The rest of my crew's interest was piqued. \"Well, my ladies, you may or may have not noticed all throughout your stay, inconspicuous sayings during the shows.\" Although, I sort of caught wind of what he was saying, everyone else's faces were wrinkled in confusion. Simon piped in excitedly, \"Every day, he gives one of us a word, and we have to try and sneak it in during our airtime.\" His excitement was partially halted when we locked eyes. But the message had been sent. My crew was in on it, especially Justice, but Molly looked wary. Although she was not at all conservative in the bedroom (Justice's stories, not mine), she was iffy about it, from what I could tell. This would be interesting. As always, please review! especially since this story is a bit of a whim. -Sage94[Chapter 11] I don't really know what to say about the lateness, other than blatant excuses. Thanks to vanillalady56 for reminding me i have a duty also, this chapter is just mostly fun, nothing too action-ey Chapter 11: Bet \" Alors, Mesdames , you will be receiving your very simple words of the day tomorrow morning.\" Dave said, adding his odd way of including French vocabulary. \"How did Count say this worked again?\" Molly asked. \"Each day, you get a word, and they get harder as the week goes by.\" The Count said from afar, startling us, because he was sitting across the room and we were speaking lowly, not really wanting to sound like amateurs. Which was pointless really, we hardly got any respect anyways. We tried to look inconspicuous, but everyone was chuckling at our anxiety. The Count was a tough one to beat. Molly ended up leaving to record, and Dave followed, but only because you could really tell he wanted to bang her. Let's face it; she wouldn't be as resistant. I was sitting by myself playing solitaire ironically, when Count came by with a cigarette and two full beers. \"Well hello mate!\" I exclaimed, happy for the beer more than the company. \"God, I can't get over your stupid accents.\" \"They ain't stupid.\" I said in a decent western accent. \" Touché .\" He said, finally sitting beside me, and handed me the beer. \"So, want to play fifty-two pick up?\" He asked. I eyed him lazily, \"Dave already tried that one last week. Was not amused.\" \"Fair enough. So I heard about you and Mark.\" I snorted, and put down my beer, almost knocking it over. Absolutely no subtlety, which is something I guess I could respect. \"What happened?\" \"Nothing.\" I said simply. \"That's not what he said.\" \"It's hard to believe Mark would say anything.\" I mentioned with a smirk. I was not at all surprised that the boys would exaggerate something like this. \"Well?\" He said expectantly. I was still a little iffy about him; he, after all, was the first to accept Gavin back into the crew. I mean, I'll live, but it was a little sore of a subject. \"I asked him if he would sleep with me.\" I said, trying to relax. \"Did you?\" he leaned in, and he smelled of cigarettes and booze. Typical. I started, \"Well no, didn't he tell you that?\" He paused, and smiled while looking away; obviously a different story was told. \"No, of course not.\" I said, completing his thoughts. He chuckled, and patted my shoulder, making me feel younger again. \"So why would you do that?\" he was still laughing. \"I just wanted to see what the big deal is.\" It was his turn to give his snort of disbelief, and I lowered my head in mock shame. \"And you were always this hotshot with the ladies?\" I asked to bring him down to earth. \"If you really wanted to, you could've just asked me.\" He said, gesturing to himself, and completely ignoring my question. I shall assume he was once a loser. \"You're a couple pounds on the plus side, but definitely bangable.\" I assured him, patting his protruding stomach amicably. \"Besides, Gavin's beat you to the punch line. But I'm going to have the last say in who...\" I waved my hand for the evident continuation. \"Right, right. Well, if you ever need any help in that department, just remember: every other Saturday is open for you.\" I laughed, \"You're fucking disgusting.\" \"As well as every other night.\" He laughed it off too, even though we both knew he wasn't kidding. But I realized that this was the first time we've ever had a conversation alone in a while. Perhaps I'd better make the best of it. \"So what's your story?\" I asked him. I remembered listening to him when he first started on Radio Rock, and he wasn't a disappointment. \"I'm not that interesting, trust me.\" I could tell though, that he was only egging me on. \"I'm sure. Just tell me!\" I said, leaning into the crook of his arm. \"Okay, okay, if you insist.\" He started off comically by looking mystifyingly into some distance, \"It all started when I was a kid, growing up in the states. You know back then I had an actual name. It was—\" \"Well, well. Not a bad upkeep on your part Count.\" Gavin said loudly from the doorway, cutting off Count's surprisingly interesting backstory. \"What now?\" I asked back, equally as loud, feeling a little stronger under the wing—however flabby—of the Count. \"Just remember what the you-know-what entails.\" He said while gallivanting away. I stood to follow him and question him, but he'd make some fuss about it. Besides, the Count was right on my doorstep, and a lot less… Gavin-ey. However, Gavin was being rather nice as of late. So I whipped around the face him, just as he was about to make a break for it. I pushed him back down with my toes, and crossed my arms. Sit-ups weren't his forte. \"God, I really gotta start working out.\" He muttered. I started, \"So.\" \"So.\" He said back, looking anywhere but me. \"Count.\" \"Meryl.\" \"What was that that Kavanagh brought up?\" I asked sweetly. \"Hmm?\" \"Bet? What bet?\" He questioned mischievously. I sat on the arm of the couch, and said: \"I know it has absolutely everything to do with me.\" \"Maybe.\" He leaned back, opening himself up. \"Just fucking tell me.\" I demanded. He flinched, \"Potty mouth.\" He sighed though, and continued, \"Telling you would ruin the fun.\" \"Fine, just as long as it has nothing to do with sex, I'm over it.\" I said casually, but halted short, when I saw some guilty smile on his face. I smacked his arm. \"What?\" He exclaimed, and retreated further into the couch. \"I wouldn't do it to you.\" I said, finally backing off, and turning. I looked back over my shoulder, and he looked put out. \"Look at me!\" He said with a laugh. \"I ain't no Mick Jagger.\" I winced at the mention of that name, but continued. \"You don't give yourself enough credit.\" I said, dropping back down to sit next to him. \"I mean you do manage to keep yourself busy every other weekend.\" He chuckled, letting me sweet-talk him. \"And I have been thinking… it would be nice to be with someone with experience.\" I said. He wasn't looking at me, but I could see his eyes bug out a bit. \"The others wouldn't mind, would they?\" I leaned into his shoulder, and I could feel goose bumps raise on his upper arm. After all, when was the last time he's ever been romanced by someone my age? \"Well, they always wanted to know who the heck you were interested in.\" He said. \"I was never very sure.\" He paused. \"But, there is something I need from you.\" I said making sure to ooze sexuality, and his eyebrows raised higher, \"My first word of the week.\" I snapped upwards, bolting for the door, while he groaned in defeat. \"Tease!\" He shouted as I stuck my tongue out on my way back to my room. I sniggered silently, happy for the relief of tension. The boys and I were on equal playing grounds, because I had all the power, it seemed. And hey, I probably wouldn't sleep with any of them, but it was oh so satisfying to see them squirm. Serves the idiots right. Two sides can play their stupid game. Much later, I was on my way to my next show with Gavin, eager to start, and for my regular banter with him. He was already set, telling me to hurry, as Dave had already finished up, only his last song remaining. I slid into my swivel chair seamlessly, and winked at Gavin. \"Busy today, aren't we?\" He asked harmlessly. I was all ready to play dumb, since I figured Count was too proud to admit that he gave their fun away, at least not yet. \"Hmm?\" I asked, with just the right amount of innocence. \"You were all over him.\" He muttered. \"What I do with my body is absolutely none of your business. Do we need to have this discussion again?\" \"Perhaps. As I recall, you seemed to enjoy our last discussion .\" I faintly saw the red on air light flicker on. Damn. That was a good one. \"Alright, but jeez Gav, no one says anything about your taste in women.\" \"Uh, Meryl, we're live.\" I paused, but then smirked at Gavin. It had been on long enough to hear me insult him, thank god. Maybe my sister was somehow listening, and took hint to the jab. \"Well played.\" He said good-naturedly. He's in a rather upbeat mood today. \"I try. Anyways, audience you are back to the best show on air,\" I glanced up and winked at Dave, \"and we've got a pretty good show lined up, especially since you sent in your polls, we'll be discussing the top ten things you hate in a partner.\" \"Yes, and I think you'll find out which ones Meryl is guilty of.\" Gavin turned on the tunes, and we had a good-hearted laugh. Though, I couldn't help but feel wary. It had been getting better between us, and if he hadn't been apart of that stupid bet thing, I'd say we were close to being friends. But I can't say I'm surprised at his participation. The record was mid-play, and we were in the midst of getting Harold to set up our playlist, and when he returned with a few more selections, he slipped a paper onto my desk. I looked at the small inoffensive paper slip. So, finally, I was in on the joke. Dave said earlier that the words were supposed to be easy this early in the week, so I was prepared. I opened it up, and in his messy scrawl was written: whore. I sniggered. If this is some sort of message, then it's not very good. \"Well, easy enough.\" I stated. Gavin looked over in interest, and I showed him, and he wrinkled his nose. \"Rather interesting as a first.\" He nodded, but smirked. Carefully, we ran down the chosen topic for our show. \"And one of the last things to hate in a partner… Drumroll.\" Gavin said. Harold had come in with his little snare. I pulled a paper out of the hat we had arranged, and read it. \"Immaturity. Good pick, dear listeners, and what a ghastly trait it is to have. This could very well be something your sweet someone could be doing. Do you find them shouting at you for nonsensical reasons? Or, maybe they are a bit too interested in the childrens' books lying around, like the classic Dr. Suess book, Hor…ton Hears A Who. If this is the case, a short goodbye is in order, unless you plan on babying him until you're both eighty.\" I cringed at the execution perhaps being a tad too direct, but I got Simon to spit his tea back into his cup, so I must have done something right. I smirked, when I saw Count next after my show, letting him know I was game for anything. \"That was too easy.\" He muttered, but nonetheless patted my shoulder on the way by. Close to supper, I was sitting in my room with Carl and Molly, laughing at Count's easy test. \"My word was easy, I can't wait for the end of the week. What a softy.\" I said. \"What was your word?\" Justice asked. \"Whore.\" I said simply. \"Wait, wait, you had whore ?\" Molly asked while breaking into a fit of giggles. \"What?\" I asked, still not done insulting Count in the most amicable way possible. \"Sorry to say, but you had it way worse. I just had to say pickle .\" She snorted, and nudged my arm. \"Good luck the rest of the week.\" Carl said, while biting into his shepherd's pie. \"Ah heck.\" I said in a hick accent. I also internally cursed myself for running my mouth. \"Well, I won't give up without the last laugh.\" \"We never had the impression you would.\" Carl said, patting my shoulder. Carl was an interesting subject lately. He seemed to be nice to me, even now. But I could see some sort of mistrust. It frustrated me to no end. But I guess I'd forget about it as long as he didn't start any weird conversations like all those weeks ago. \"Good.\" I said, eager for second helpings. I went to the dining room-ish place and the only thing stopping me from getting me to the tray of food were four conniving boys; they could hardly be called men if you took into account their actions. I guess the same view could be used on me. Anyways, the moment I walked in, it was silent, and Dave, Mark, Gavin and Count rounded their heads to glance. Angus was sitting with them too, but in terms of this little bet they had going, he didn't seem to be in the running. Though of course why Dave would be there too is beyond me. \"Hello.\" I said slowly. \"Hey.\" Dave said, trying his best to appear seductive. I can't see why that Marianne girl would have done anything with him. I cleared my throat, and slipped behind Gavin's chair, but he slid out, and his chair pinned my trailing leg. I snorted. \"Nice try.\" On try , I shoved his chair back easily enough, especially since he was rather thin. They just sniggered. I shook my head and grabbed another plateful, when they poked at my appetite. \"That's going straight to your hips, you know that.\" Dave said. \"And you're one to talk, Dave.\" I said, though I don't think he minded all that much. \"Ow.\" He pretended to be shot. \" Please ,\" I said, while grinning at his antics. I gathered my food, and turned to leave, getting past Gavin again, this time he didn't try to stop me. When I reached the door, I turned around to face them and opened my mouth, but I didn't say anything for some reason. It suddenly bothered me that they were sitting together. I cleared my throat and left abruptly. I mentally slapped myself for letting them get to me. I guess I'll soon make quick work of them and them that their tricks won't bother me. Over and over that night, I chastised myself, criticizing every single detail I remember myself doing in the past few weeks. If I wasn't so damn slutty, this might not have happened. Or, pretend-slutty. This probably resulted from me fake-throwing my cat around and they were fed up. Maybe I should just pick one of them, and be done with it. The chase won't be all that fun after, if I'm just like Molly or Justice. Then it will get back to competing for airtime. After much debate, it was early enough to go see Bob, since it was clear I was not going to sleep a wink. \"Bob I have a problem.\" \"More so than usual?\" He asked, adjusting his mike, and setting down his first few records. \"I guess you could say that. It's about sex.\" He paused shortly before setting down his things, \"And what have you to worry about that?\" \"Do you live under a rock?\" I asked, before remembering whom I was talking to. \"Right, well more specifically a first time.\" \"Well, its not so bad, just stick it in and—\" \"Bob, female here.\" \"Oh, right yes, well I suppose it's a bit different then,\" He said thoughtfully. I was glad he didn't seem too embarrassed about the subject, but from what he's said from back in his day, I didn't really expect that. \"I could give you a whole speech, about abstinence, and some fifties' values crap, but what would that do? Look at you. The most I can say is that you got to make sure it's with someone you tolerate.\" His voice rose at the end, in a way he probably didn't realize, but it made my stomach feel weird. I didn't really love anyone here, and I was looking for sex. I mean, some people were barely tolerable, but I didn't actually love them. But I can't help but wonder how much more different this conversation would have gone if I were a boy. The thought made me chuckle uneasily. Well, I can't see Mark's father telling him to hold back. Hell, I'm slightly impressed by him, if I'm in a good mood, and I forget that I almost got it on with him. \"I didn't peg you as someone who would say that, no offence.\" I managed. \"None taken.\" He hummed to himself, and went back to selecting him music. Once again, I woke early in the morning, finding myself alone after dozing during Bob's show. He had gotten used to leaving a lot, and me, leaving. I was lazily rising from my comfortable couch, when Simon came in. He didn't see me right away, and gave a jump when I said \"Hi.\" \"Oh, hello.\" His voice was cheery, yet relieved; I could tell he had had his morning cup of tea. \"Where's Bob?\" He asked. I sat up. \"Well, he's probably left already, it must be the last song.\" I tried to fix my hopeless hair so I would at least look presentable, but gave up as usual. \"It's a long one,\" As it usually is. Bob sometimes likes to leave enough time for Simon to come down. I was a bit sceptical, since Simon knew this. Well, I couldn't blame him for attempting to make conversation. I was never usually here long enough to meet up with Simon a whole lot. It got quiet again, while Simon got ready for his set, but he spoke again. \"It's Christmas soon.\" \"Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty excited about that.\" I stood to stretch. \"Are ya going ashore?\" He asked nonchalant. I hesitated. I hadn't exactly tried to make plans. \"I dunno, I figure I'll try and fudge things up with Marlow and her boyfriend . To be honest, I'm surprised they've lasted.\" \"Yeah…\" He smiled in concurrence, but I didn't expect that he fully followed my distress. Given the chance, every man on this ship would risk pushing my sister off of Big Ben to have a chance by Mick Jagger's side. I wouldn't blame them. It wouldn't hurt my opinion of them either. \"Well, it's been fun, but I'm off to bed.\" \"Oh, hold on, I'm supposed to give you this.\" A hand pulled me back by my wrist, but the meagre contact made me stop anyways. I flickered my gaze to his hand, but paid my best attention to his other hand, which held a white slip. Damn. I took it and went to turn, but Simon had this half-expectant look on his face. I sighed, unfolded the small piece of paper, and read \"Intercourse.\" Well played. Hopefully the next one comes quicker folks, sorry. and by quicker, i mean slightly less than last time. Well, in the meantime, youz could readz my chapters over, because its been so long you've most likely forgotten the happenings[Chapter 12] Okay so I'm very sorry for not being around. its been like a year. i wasn't sure i liked where this was headed before tbh. but i'm going to try and reign it in, if you're all still interested. i wrote a little bit longer of a chapter, and plan to write a bit outside of the canon plot for this film, and draw it into Meryl's own story, but don't worry, i will keep it as true as possible, and i don't ever mean to eliminate our favourite pirates. the updates might be slow, but if people are enthusiastic about it, it might be easier to stay motivated. anyways, cheers, and remember to review :) Chapter 12: Drink \"Christ, you'd think with all these note jabs they're trying to put me in the mood,\" I said as I tossed aside yet another conquered word of the day. This word was penetration, which was surprisingly easier than the day before's condom. We were currently occupying the lounge couches, Justice, Molly, and I, legs piled on over each other. Molly was picking at her nails nonchalant and Justice was almost dozing off. I knew it was a tired subject as of late. Someone wanted to poke fun at a Pop Wave, and I being the noticeably less experienced was an easy target. \"Meh,\" Molly said, clipping here and there. \"Maybe I should just do it.\" I grumbled and tossed my head back with force. The other's weren't fazed. \"Where is everyone?\" \"On deck, it's almost nice out, for winter.\" Molly sighed. It was quiet a long while longer, while I wondered if they had heard what I said. \"I said maybe I should just do it.\" \"What?\" Molly replied. \"You know, the thing in bed.\" Justice snorted, proving she was actually awake. \"Shut up,\" I quipped. \"If you make a big deal out of it, so are they.\" She pointed out. \"I'm not making a big-\" Justice, without opening her eyes said, \"Yes, you certainly are. Think about it. Why do they target you? Because you make a great fuss. You're also easy on the eyes, but they also gain a reaction out of you.\" \"She's right, Meryl,\" Molly began, \"If you just let it be, and were not too concerned with it , then maybe they will get over it.\" I didn't want to admit it but this reinforced my idea that I should just do it, but I had hoped with someone I loved. But I looked at whom I was sitting with. By now, Molly and Justice were seasoned veterans, in terms of the mentality of being free to make love. \"Fine.\" \"Fine what?\" Molly prodded. \"You're both right but maybe I still do want it.\" \"Want what?\" Justice teased. \"A shag,\" I grumbled. \"A what?\" Justice cupped her hand around her ear. \"Shag.\" \"Hmm?\" \"Dammit woman, open your ears, I said I wanted a shag.\" At a precisely excellent moment, the door had swung open to an unsuspecting Angus, holding his toast. His eyes were wide and he quickly stalked across the carpet towards the deck to be out of our midst. \"Do you suppose he'll tell…\" Molly wondered. \"Oh fuck,\" I said and tossed the girls' legs off me and tried to follow him up, \"No, wait Angus, don't!\" But the top door was shut before I reached the steps. \"That just might make things easier for you.\" \"Oh, might it? Bring it on then, I might as well just wait in my room for them all the drop by.\" \"Listen, babe, if it were me, just pick the one that pisses you off the least. If it comes up later, at least you can say it was the cream of this rotting crop. Or you could jack off, it's less complicated.\" Molly said with her general ease. \"And if it makes you feel better, not a word will be said to the rest of our crew as much as we can help it.\" \"Alright, that is some good information.\" I said falsely bright, still preoccupied with what had just happened. I wasn't so much worried about the telling now, it was just the hopeful look that Angus almost had that I wanted to snuff. \"Today's Friday, right?\" I asked. \"Yeah, why?\" Molly confirmed. \"And it's not the second weekend?\" \"So the person of your choosing will probably be at full swing horniness right now, just like you, aching for the next weekend. Just so that mental image is in your head. It could be anyone, even Bob. Sounds like they weren't calling him Smooth Bob for nothing back in the day.\" Molly winked. \"Okay, gross.\" I said, and Justice groaned in agreement. \"Are you a fan of hair?\" Molly asked. I quirked my brow. \"I'm only asking, because I'm wondering who shaves down there. Mark for sure.\" \"Um, okay, I think it'll be of little consequence when it comes down to it.\" And really I didn't need the mental image of every member with or without bush. \"Carl?\" Justice asked. \"He hasn't been a total ass according to your rapport recently.\" \"We'll see.\" I was actually considerate of that option. \"Simon? He'd like that post-marriage.\" Molly said thoughtfully. \"Yes, but that's post-marriage. We don't want his tears soaking the bedsheets.\" Justice stated. \"Well I could always go ashore and say I did it, and then come back and they'd leave me alone.\" \"Yes, but then you'd have to have done it.\" Molly said with a drop of her shoulders. \"Why?\" I asked indignantly. \"Because everyone will know right away if you haven't.\" Molly shrugged. I would have argued but even I knew the face, and overall demeanour of someone who had done the deed. I knew I was calm, but had no dice on someone like Mark. The glow was easier to see on young people, since upon inspection you had no idea on someone such as the Count could get anyone, the glow barely visible through his scruff. Maybe it was his vulgarity. The girls were about to run off a couple more options when the door creaked and I bid a quick farewell and the chilly boys filed in shortly, not catching sight of the woman they were previously chatting about. That night, before my set, I napped, more deeply than usual. It was one of those sleeps where the dreams came easily in no time at all. A couple knocks at my door woke me suddenly. I stretched and grumbled, \"Wot?\" \"You're on in five.\" \"Mmkay.\" I called. I almost slipped back into blissful sleep, but I got my wits about my dream. Weirdly, it was about Simon. I was wide awake now, struggling to retell the dream over in my mind. It was about that poor fellow becoming this flirtatious man's man. In the dream he was hitting on me, and I'm afraid that I liked it. A damn lot. He was adorable, in a dopey kind of way in real life, but I massaged my temples in an exasperated fashion, because it could never be. Even after that adorable kiss. \"I'm too damn horny for this ship.\" I told myself. Only a fool would add insult to injury; he'd already lost one woman, and though the man had said all was good, I suspected otherwise, that instead it was a pride issue. I looked down at myself, a crap t-shirt that was too tight, and a pair of hole-y jeans. I felt a wreck. I knew it was high time that I pulled my shit together, but every time I tried, my \"dumb\" feelings got in the way. I changed into something less showy, before another knock at the door. \"Meryl!\" Molly said behind the door. \"You're almost on!\" \"I'm up, I'm up!\" I said, barely doing up the last button before pulling open the door. \"You look—\" \"I know!\" I said, dashing to the recording studios. I pulled my hair into a bun before crashing into my station. \"And you're live with Meryl and her oh so incapable co-host, mister Gavin Kavanagh.\" I winded myself, before the other DJ could open his mouth. \"Ah, yes, here we are folks, in the hands of a woman who can scarcely make it out of bed to greet the loyal fans. What do you say to that, aye?\" I caught my breath as he spoke to the audience, to my discredit. \"I say, I can admit to needing every ounce of beauty sleep I can get, lest I look like a threadbare, aging oaf—oh, wait. Sorry.\" I winked to keep it lighthearted, for he had fared harsher words before. \"Might as well have cut out my heart, deary, I'm sure the thousands of letters from the fans directed to me have everything to do with my age.\" \"Like fine wine, Kavanagh.\" \"With that said, welcome to our show, and settle in with your favourite pair, bringing you only your carnal desires to reality. Don't let your mother know we're here, bringing you the very best in music.\" \"This first pick is sent in by Julie in the heart of London, dedicating it to her college sweetheart. Ah young love.\" The track played, 'Gimme Some Lovin' already set out for me. \"What happened to you?\" Gavin asked, looking me over. \"What, what's wrong with me?\" I looked down at myself, unable to pinpoint anything. \"You're never that close. Had to get Harold to grab your list.\" \"Thank you Harold!\" I waved at him, smiling apologetically. I usually liked to pick my tracks, but he was dearly appreciated. \"No worries,\" he replied, sitting comfortably on the couch. \"You're flustered.\" Gavin said, knowingly. \"I've just ran here.\" \"Molly said you were napping. You're slipping.\" \"A momentary lapse. Hardly a bother.\" I said as confidently as possible, but didn't like that I couldn't see his eyes, once again. Hard to tell what he was thinking. \"I know what it is!\" He exclaimed, \"You're not wearing shades.\" \"And?\" I demanded. \"You know what? I heard a funny thing this afternoon, before I was done outside Angus gave the lads a little chat.\" Her heart dropped. He changed that subject quickly. \"And right now I can read you like a book.\" I fumbled with the drawers, keeping eye contact, while I searched the contents by feel. \"And what do you read?\" \"You just might get more flustered.\" I dropped what I was looking for in the open drawer to the floor and snapped down to get it, hitting my head off the edge of the damn thing. \"Bugger!\" My hand wrapped around the shades I was looking for and I unfolded them, putting them on, and ignored the searing pain on my forehead blankly. Gavin's eyebrow lifted in an amused fashion and I wanted to dearly to comfort the bruising. \"Whatever you may have heard, I assure you—\" \"Are most definitely not true, or you would be going against your own words.\" I kept my face straight, wary of the song's ending. \"Would someone grab me a drink.\" Only Harold was around so he ran off, nice enough. He returned, and handed me the nice cold beverage and while Gavin was busying himself with shining his boot, I pressed the cold can to my forehead. \"Meryl.\" \"Ya, Gavin,\" I snipped, and rounded back at him, putting down the can as quickly as possible. \"Fix your blouse.\" I had overlooked two buttons, showing the tops of the cups, and the ones that were done up were mismatched. So much for \"less showy\" \"I don't care.\" I said quickly. For some idiotic measure, I let loose the top button, and the flannel bared shoulder and cleavage, but still kept a clean face. He seemed impressed, and swivelled away to grab his next track. I had a couple beers, and through the steady process of becoming drunker, I gained a small dubious audience. The usually controlled Meryl, gabbing away, more carefree in a less composed sort of carefree. Dubiousness instead turned to amusement, for drunk I was apparently proving hilarious, speaking out of turn, cutting off Gavin. More than usual. But the bite was gone, I suppose I played along more, and laughed genuinely, whenever the cuts were redirected to me. His insults were equally as harmless. Harold sat with Molly and Dave, whom all clapped when the curtain called. \"You're quite a bit flirtatious, whats in your drink?\" Gavin remarked. \"Hmm?\" I murmured, stacking my records in a dangerously uneven tower, unsuccessful in appearing focused while drunk. I was just trying to help out old Harold. \"Let's stop that,\" Harold murmured, and swooped by to cart them away. \"Just a beer. And I found your whiskey in the bottom drawer.\" \"Whiskey, I'll remember that.\" Dave winked. \"Hmhm, I'll be careful around you, big guy.\" I giggled sleepily. The show was over, and Molly dragged Dave out of sight, by his collar. Harold took the records to the room over and I was alone with the smoking Gavin. I came out of my cell and tripped up on the carpet, but was able to steady myself. I wanted to do up the buttons to the top, figuring the fun in that was over, but struggled with simply one. The bloody thing kept slipping out of my fingers. \"Blast.\" I grumbled. But a terrible idea struck me. So terrible that in this state I just... had to. \"Gavin come here.\" I hailed. The man came round his door and took off his glasses. \"M'lady?\" \"I need help. The, er, the things on my shirt. The round thingies, they need doing.\" I guided his hands to my chest carelessly, that he had to pull back a little before—I slackened my grip. Gavin carefully grasped the edge of the fabric and the buttons, taking his time with each one. He focused on not meeting my gaze, and pursed his lips. I stood as still as a drunk could, staring dazedly at his scruff, and steadied my breathing. \"You've been christened.\" He said suddenly. \"How do you mean?\" I said, looking down at his handiwork. \"It's an honour to have seen you blazing drunk on the air. You're not a total fool, as others before you.\" \"Well that's a relief.\" I smiled. \"Did that bump hurt?\" He finished the very top button up by my neck, but still held the collar tips. \"It's fine.\" I looked up, and he was looking right back down at me. I couldn't pretend that gooseflesh had not just spread up my back. \"Is it?\" His thumb gently touched the small bump before the hairline. \"You…\" I breathed, and tilted my chin upwards. The rest of my sentence faded. He cleared his throat. \"You're clearly drunk, and you'd better run back to your little birds.\" I considered him, inebriated albeit, and warmly nodded. I patted his chest good-heartedly and then flitted back to my cabin, thinking unchaste thoughts about the kind man who had buttoned the little round thingies on my shirt. The splitting headache the next morning was enormous. I had not even had much, as far as I could recall. I was still in her clothes from the day before, but it was a miracle vomit wasn't all over the floor, judging by the current pains. I changed into fresh clothes, blunder free, and made my way to the kitchen for some hangover relief. Simon was up as usual, his tea cup nestled in his lap as he read a week old paper. \"Mornin',\" I greeted. He looked at me pointedly. I ignored it. \"What's in the kettle?\" \"Earl Gray.\" I poured a cup as I watched him stare at the page. In one spot. \"Kavanagh?\" the man asked incredulously, sensing me looking at him. \"What about him?\" I fixed my tea slowly. \"Maybe you shouldn't be roaring before you get on the mic.\" \"If this is about my drinking,\" I stalked around the table for a seat opposite to Simon, \"which I suspect it is not, I will say this: you can not tell me what to do. That is the whole point of us girls being here. The nation told us no, and then a boat full of boys told us no by sinking our ship, we're not about to let either of them get in the way again, and you think you can pressure me into being a sweet little girl? So if you can't handle a girl with her whiskey, row yourself back to shore.\" I was not truly upset with him, but if I was going to remind someone that I was in charge, it was going to be my friends first, so they knew my boundaries. People like Gavin had no boundaries. \"I'm just worried he'll hurt you like—\" \"Nothing I can't handle, Simon.\" \"Handled as well as you drink?\" \"I at least trust you all enough to be drunk around you.\" \"Just remember… you don't have to be drunk. For people to care about ya.\" He said calmly. \"You've been talking to Carl?\" I asked amusedly, recalling a similar conversation. A boyish frown fixed on his face and he downed the rest of his tea. \"Simon Swafford has a show to prepare.\" He grumbled. \"Isn't it tomorrow?\" I teased. Simon stalked away, knowing by now preaching was a lost cause. And it was indeed only Friday. I almost felt bad, sending him away feeling exasperated, but things had to be said. And though he was a nice guy, this sort of thing was overbearing. Carl walked in the room and greeted Simon, but the latter man just walked straight. The young man shrugged, and sat next to me. \" You were very… affectionate last night.\" Carl started. \"I've barely had my tea.\" \"Relax Carl, the lady did well. If you ask me, it's better than the farting special Angus did last summer when he was drunk.\" Dave defended, coming in right behind Carl. \"I resent every ounce of that day.\" Angus called out from the hall. \"What did I do?\" I asked quietly to Carl. \"You should ask Gavin.\" Carl said with good humour. \"You can shut your mouth.\" I snipped. \"Or ask the listeners who tuned in for that fun fest.\" He continued. \"Kill me now or this headache'll do the work.\" \"At least we know what will do the trick.\" Dave taunted. \"My public humiliation and probable future infamy as a drunk?\" \"Whiskey.\" A just-arrived Count said, plopping a new bottle in front of her. \"Great. Just give me a break until I'm two minutes sober. Then I'll have another drink.\" I laid my head on the nice cool table, eager to have some peace and rest the bruise near my temple. \"What is the damage, Count?\" \"I think she said something about Gavin's golden locks.\" The Count threw back imaginary waves of hair, speaking like I wasn't there. \"Or his chiseled jaw.\" Dave agreed. \"If the whole of the UK isn't jealous by now, you might as well shag him on air.\" \"That would be something.\" I understated. \" If the whole UK wanted him.\" Count chastised. \"I already told you mate, I'm not gonna fuck you.\" I said all the white still face down, muffled a little. \"No you didn't!\" He feigned desperation. I semi-lifted my head, \"Well I just did.\" \"Alas maiden fairest, it wasn't meant to be. I got some chicks coming over next weekend.\" \"Ah, so romantic.\" I supplied. \"The smoothest.\" \"Maiden fairest?\" Carl teased. \"Don't you forget it, you skinny oaf.\" I kicked his leg under the table. \"Ow. Alright.\" Later that day, the hangover mostly subsided, I tried to take it easy above deck, and stare at the sky, the only thing that was still and at least grey. I occupied the only other lawn chair next to Mark, who looked as if he was sleeping. When I sat, I saw him raise an eyebrow, ever so slightly. \"Oh, hey, it's cool if I sit here, right?\" He didn't say anything so I just laid back. It was cold, though milder than usual. In my jumper and wooly socks, it was a perfect enough temperature to calm my nerves. \"No hard feelings, about that stand up, aye?\" I asked, but felt that was incomplete. \"It's not you, really mate. I got my own stuff to deal with. I mean it's definitely not you, you're gorgeous. Let's just get that clear. I just need something more I think, to prompt any… well you know.\" I tensed, just babbling, and thought it was my own doing, but this was it. This was all him, his aura, and his leather trousers, just beckoning me to his room, even if I was confessing I didn't want him. My eyes shut but at least the nausea was mostly gone. Mostly turned into embarrassment that I had just given a speech to a man I definitely had zero opposition to shagging. I blew out a breath and got up and left, figuring if I were in his presence any longer I might as well tuck myself in his bed and wait. \"Good chat, mate.\" I said, and went back inside. \"Anytime.\" He replied. I hesitated at the steps, where he couldn't see me, but I couldn't help but notice the double entendre. What a mysterious man. It being close to Christmas, only weeks away, Quentin approached me. \"You seem to have gotten a bit of mail.\" \"I thought I told 'em to shove it on my bunk.\" I said, but grabbed it from him anyways. \"Who's it from?\" I read it so he didn't answer. \"My bloody mother.\" Quentin started away, but glanced over his shoulder. \"Not planning an unexpected vacation, are you?\" He asked. \"No, why?\" \"I say go for it. Think of the charts.\" He flitted away before I could turn it over and see the broken seal. Whoever but my mother uses seals anymore? \"That's illegal!\" I called out. \"We're all illegal.\" He stated calmly, turning a corner. I giggled at his antics, and opened the letter. My mother pleaded me to come to shore. I felt a frown slip over my face. This was about how important it was to my dearest sister Marlow, and the budding relationship with Mick, and the utmost importance that he meet her family, which included me (probably to their dismay). She made no mention about the pleasure of my company, but I at least hoped it was underlying. But at least it was not a total loss, I would get to meet a great man, and if I was around long enough, maybe the entire band. The invitation included was not only a dinner, per se, but a party. An industry party. Which meant press. Pictures of myself and other important guests. Hell, I'm apart of the one of, if not the biggest broadcasters playing them; this had to be good for Radio Rock. I mulled that over for a moment, and folded the letter to sneak back to my room. Higher ratings for Radio Rock. This would be good. Since it is clear that I draw attention, likened to the Count and Kavanagh. But where did that leave me and my crew? I could just imagine Jackie, who was already hard working looking for supporters and funding for another station, fuming over this, seeing Quentin gaining the publicity. Of course we're all equally sought out by the law, always trying to undermine our work, but there was still this matter that the partnership was only between our two stations because they sunk our ship. No, I'd have to appear as a free agent. No station attached to my name. But the only person who was second to Gavin Kavanagh at self-branding, in my books, was my sister Marlow. She'd definitely paid her dues climbing that social ladder, and now everyone knew her name. The Fergusons. Marlow Ferguson. Meryl Ferguson. I think I'd quite enjoy being recognized before her. Not overshadowed. This could work to Pop Wave's advantage. But if Quentin knew it would draw more ratings, then how would he make me work with the Rolling Stones to get them?

But everything Jane needed to convict him of was clutched in her hands. Thenlavender silk panties in her hands were not hers and they both knew it, sonEddie didn't even try to deny the fact that he had met a woman in a barnwhen Jane was away in Syracuse. \"What was her name?\" She demanded as shencrumpled said panties and threw them at Eddie. \"Katie\" He said softly andnJane laughed almost cruelly. \"Tell me why you did it\" She said as she stared intently at the dyingnflowers. \"I don't know why Jane, you were gone and I was missing you\" Janenrolled her eyes. \"1 and a half years don't mean anything to you does it?\"nShe asked, sadness overtaking her voice. \"Of course it does Jane, but youndon't understand\" He said helplessly and suddenly the anger was back. Shenwas turning into a one-woman circus. \"What don't I understand Eddie?\" Hernvoice was almost a hiss. He didn't know what to say, to calm her down or to make her believe him. \"Indon't know what you want me to say Jane, I'm sorry\" She shook her head andnthe tears that had been kept so well at bay began to fall. \"I loved you\"nShe sobbed out and Eddie thought that he could pinpoint the exact momentnwhen he felt his heart rip into two. Now his own tears began to well in hisneyes but he stubbornly pushed them back. \"What do you want me to do Jane?\" He asked softly, he wished that she wouldnlook at him, but her eyes were holding firmly on the flowers by his feet.n\"I want you to go\" She said in a voice that was barely more then a whispernbut it affected Eddie as if she had screamed it in his face. He turned hernback to her and walked to the door, his footsteps nearly echoing in thenloft. As he wrenched the door knob he looked at her sadly. \"I wish I could turn back time so I never did what I did, but I can't. Itnwas a mistake that I never intended to make. That day when you ran afternthe cab like an idiot, I knew that you were the only woman that I wouldnever need in my life again, but that night I was weak Jane because I amnjust a man. You of all people should understand how weak men are. Whatevernelse I tell you, you won't listen to it because I know how proud andnstubborn you can be. You can disbelieve everything I've just told you butnnot this, if you never believe anything in the world again let this be thenlast thing you remember, I love you Jane\" The door slowly shut behind him and Jane almost wished that he had slammednit and stormed off in a rage. They had had fights before and it was alwaysnEddie's style to pour an ice-laden drink and stormed out of the apartment,nbut not tonight. His steps were slow, like an old man who wasn't sure wherenhe was going. Jane slowly sank down to the couch where she and Eddie hadnspent so many cozy nights talking or watching TV or just simply beingntogether. She sniffled and sobbed into her hands. The love of her life hadnjust walked out the door and she didn't know if she would ever see him walknthrough the apartment doors again. Eddie walked along the side of the East River and looked into the midnightnblue waters that swirled and splashed along the rafters of the East RivernBridge. The wind was ice cold and made the wet trail of tears on his cheeksnburn before he angrily wiped them away with the back of his hand. He ran anhand over his dark brown hair and gave a watery sigh. Sleeping with Katie Dawson was one of the worst mistakes he had made in hisnlife, and he had made a lot. He was lonely and a pretty young redhead wasnpaying attention to him and with enough bourbon and loneness in his system,nhe had let Katie convince him to take her up to his apartment. She had beennsoft and obedient and didn't stay late in the morning as some of hisnprevious exploits were known to do. He should have stayed in the apartment and watched the Yankees kill thenBraves with his own supply of beer and whiskey, but he had found his wayndown to the bar and that was when the trouble began. Suddenly he realizednwhat he had been doing to all the women whose hearts he had broken and henfelt sick. He never fought that being rejected could hurt as much as itndid; it was like feeling someone sticking a needle into his heart andndraining everything that kept it alive. The time on his watch was just rounding two in the morning and all thenlights in the houses and buildings were kept wisely off, as if they knewnthat he would be passing through. He dipped his hand inside his thin coatnpocket and retrieved a small box which held a classy diamond ring. HadnHelena's underwear not been found, he would have asked her to marry himnthat night; he knew exactly what he was going to say. The garder between the river and the walkway was still slick from the rainnthat morning, he remembered he thought that Jane would like to have anlittle garden bow outside the bedroom window so she could grow and tend hernflowers that she kept in pots around the apartment and babied. The coldnwind returned and teased his mused dark brown hair and he sighed thenncursed himself viciously. He looked up at the burnished silver moon andnmillions of twinkling stars and settled on a still semi-damp bench andnignored that fact that his pants were getting wet. He rested his head in his hands and didn't know for how long he didn'tnmove, he just sat there in the chilly New York morning that reminded himnthat fall was yielding to winter and that the snow would soon encrust thenground, pavement and grass alike. His breath came out in white puffs whennhe lifted his head up. He had come to his conclusion. A second wind camenin, more harsh then before and ripped at his lean body. The railing was slippery and ice cold as he placed a hand over it, hisnfingers clenched it in consideration and he sighed. He looked over the sidenof the railing and examined the drop. It was a good 300 feet from thenbridge to the river. The water was said to be 20 degrees this time of yearnand if the fall didn't kill him the hypothermia would. With a sigh as bitter as the wind, he hoisted himself up onto the railing,ncareful not to let his feet slip out from under him. He balanced himselfnfor a minute, looking down into the swirling dark waters that would consumenhim. His breath came faster in thick white puffs of steam and he closed hisneyes. Another wind came by and nearly shoved him off the garder. When another wind came, it was unusually warmer; he thought he could hear anwoman calling his name on the wind. He looked over his shoulder yet saw nonone. He sighed deeply and slowly urged himself off the garder to thenpavement again. \"It's not worth it\" He said to himself softly and took anstep back as if to examine the garder and the river. He shuffled his feet slowly as he walked along the road and glanced at allnthe unlit apartment buildings and offices. Rain began to fall again, softlynat first then harder and harder until it was driving and ice cold. Tomorrownthe roads would ice like Jane's heart and people would abandon the publicntransportation and walk, crowding the streets even more. He began to prep himself for what he was going to say to Jane when he gotnback. He would convince her that he would be faithful to her from thatnmoment now, and then he would get down on one knee and make her his wife.nArmed with his speech, he crossed the four-way intersection. So focused onnhis speech and how he would kiss Jane and make her knees turn weak, hendidn't notice the rumble of a car motor was it drove down the nearlyndeserted street with it's headlights off, by the time he did notice, it wasnalmost right on top of him, and the really funny thing was, the car didn'tnstop even for a second.[Chapter 2] Jane was still cursing his name when she got the call. Without knowing whatnelse she could do, she called Liz. Together they drove to St.Simon Memorialnand raced towards the building. \"Where is he?\" Jane demanded as shenlaunched herself upon the young desk clerk who looked frightened. \"Whonma'am?\" She asked politely, through Jane's sudden attack had strained hernnerves. \"Eddie Alden! He was brought in. He was brought in, he was hit byna car\" The nurse whose tag read 'Renee' began to type into the computer.n\"Spell his last name ma'am?\" Jane wanted to wrap her hands around thenwoman's neck. \"A L D E N. God what the fuck is the matter with younpeople?!\" A white-coated doctor strolled up while Liz comforted Jane with soothingnstrokes and pats. \"Hello my name is Ryan English. Are you friends ornrelatives of an Edward Jacob Alden?\" \"I'm his girlfriend\" Jane said quicklynand turned to Liz. \"This is Elizabeth Matthews, a friend of his. How isnhe?\" English seemed hesitant so avoided answering the question. \"I'm goingnto need you to answer some questions about Mr.Alden for his medical chart.nHe led Jane and Liz to a row of ugly yellow chairs and sat them down. \"Nownhow old is he?\" \"Eddie's turning 28 in 4 days\" English nodded and scribbledndown some notes. He asked them a barrage of questions almost bouncing fromnif he were allergic to anything to the picture of a blue bunny he drew innthe 1st grade. \"How is he?\" Jane demanded when English closed the notebook slowly andnrose. \"I will be blunt with you,\" He said and held up a hand as Jane triednto rise too. \"You might want to stay seated\" He advised and Liz eased Janenback into the seat. \"Your boyfriend has a lot of trauma mostly to the headnand that's never an easy situation. \"We've closed what we can but there isna lot of internal bleeding, if we can't get it drained in time and find ansuiting match, then there is a possibility that he might drown in his ownnblood\" Jane felt a sickly thick bile claw its way up her throat and she pressednher head into her hands and a moan escaped her lips. \"There is anothernpossibility,\" English began and Jane looked up sharply. \"That he'll pullnthrough, the by amount of scars we found on his body, it seems like he's ansurvivor. But if he does, all the signs point to that he will be brain-ndead\" Jane nodded and turned to Liz. \"Why don't you get a soda from thencafeteria or something?\" Liz regarded her slowly. \"Are you going to be ok?\"nJane plastered a fake smile on her unpainted lips. \"Yeah\". Reluctantly, Liznrose from the seats and once she left, Jane returned her dark gaze tonEnglish. \"What exactly,\" She began as she massaged her tired eyes. \"Is the chancenthat he'll live?\" English seemed to pause for a moment as he polished hisnglasses on the white front of his coat. \"I won't lie to you,\" He said andncontinued when Jane said nothing. \"The odds aren't in his favor at 25%.nWith all his injuries he shouldn't be alive right now\" Jane felt as if thenground beneath her feet was crumbling. \"It was my fault he walked out,\" Shensaid as the uncontrollable tears began to tumble down her cheeks. \"We hadnhad a fight and he walked out. If I hadn't been such a bitch then he wouldnbe alright now\" Sympathy began to stir in English for Jane. \"There's no accounting for whynthese sort of things happen Miss.Goodale, but that 25% chance is stillnthere, so all hope is not lost\" He squeezed Jane's hand reassuringly then annurse with a blood smeared shirt came and Jane felt her heart drop. Thennurse whispered something in English's ear and he gaze Jane an apologeticnsmile. \"I'm sorry Miss.Goodale but I have to go back to the room. I suggestnthat you go home and try to rest and we will call you if anything happens\"nJane shook her head. \"No, I want to stay here with him\" Realizing that shenwasn't going to leave the hospital willfully he nodded. \"Alright, I'll havenNurse Renee Parker set up an empty bed for you\" Jane smiled gratefully andnfollowed the nurse down the opposite hallway. It was about 2 in the morning when Jane heard people running through thenhalls. For a moment she was in a panic because she couldn't remember wherenshe was. Then when she heard the intercom calling out the names of randomndoctors and nurses, the realization came with the fresh hot lick of fear.nWhen they called for Ryan English, Jane began to grope for her cell phonento call Liz. When Liz arrived at the hospital, she was a little groggy butnalert all the same, she looked shrunken in her oversized Mets T-shirt andnjogging pants, but her eyes were clear and she was at Jane's side all thensame. There was nothing that Jane or Liz could do and they felt helpless and theynhated it. Slowly the pace returned to normal and Jane and Liz waited in thencorridor to see if they could grab English to shake information out of him.nBut English was no where to be found and Renee insisted that she didn'tnknow either, though Jane suspected that the pretty brunette nurse wasnholding information out on her. Jane paced up and down the corridor like anrestless tiger and Liz followed her with her eyes while she played with thenhem of her shirt and got the attention of the cute male intern she onlynknew as Will. Then they saw English walking down the hall, his steps sharp and crisp yetna little doggy. His chocolate brown hair fell in front of his dark greenneyes as if he had just recovered from a mad dash. As he got closer, Janennoticed that the youthful color had gone from his face and in its place wasna pale flush that made Jane's nerves stand on the edge of hysteria. \"How isnhe?\" Liz asked when Jane didn't, she seemed frozen in place. Englishnregarded then silently for a minute, taking in their appearance andnsituation. He placed his hands lightly on Jane's shoulders and took a deepnbreath. \"We had thought that we found a matching donor\" He said slowly and beforenJane or Liz had the time to say anything, he continued. \"However, Edward'snbody rejected it and the second donor that he had on list turned out to beninfected with AIDS. The nurses didn't pick it up when they screened thenblood, and the man who gave us the blood didn't seem to think it wasnimportant to tell us that he had AIDS\" While he paused, Jane took thenopportunity to talk. \"But if it were a match, then why didn't you give itnto him?\" English raised a dark eyebrow. \"Because it would infect him withnthe virus\" Jane simply pushed it aside. \"He would recover from the accidentnthough right?\" \"Yes,\" English said on the verge of impatient. \"But he wouldnsuffer from AIDS and it would just be a matter for 1 to 4 years until hendies from it\" Liz rubbed the back of Jane's tense back and motioned for English to tellnthem whatever he had come to say. \"The point of the case is ladies thatnsince we couldn't use the second donor and his body rejected the first sonviolently it only added to the accident trauma,\" He paused, seeming to trynto find another way to approach the matter. \"Everyone did all they could,\"nJane's eyes transformed into smoky brown dinner plates \"But it wasn'tnenough and sadly, his pulse and blood dropped at around 1:45 this morningnand the residents on call did everything that they could due to revive him,nbut it wasn't enough. I'm very sorry\" Liz dropped into the chair with her head in her hands while Jane simplynstood there frozen. \"Excuse me?\" She heard herself say dumbly. Sympathynswirled in English and he stroked a lean hand over Jane's shoulder and downnher arm. \"He died at around 2:15. The residents and I did everything thatnthey taught us to do, we even pulled things out of our asses to revive him,nbut nothing worked. I'm so sorry, I know how hard this must be on you\" Janentook a deep wavering breath and slowly collapsed against English. Anheartbroken moan escaped her lips and English caught her in hisnsurprisingly strong arms.[Chapter 3] From crossing the street to waking up, being in the large brightly lit roomnwas the first thing that Eddie could remember. People were mulling aroundnbut no one seemed to be paying any real attention to him, only the fewnfluttering looks the young girls gave him that he really didn't understandnin the first place. Suddenly out of no where, a little girl about 6-years-nold came running up to him and took his hand in her pale one. \"Are younEddie then?\" She said cheerfully in an accent tinted with London. \"Yes\" Hensaid slowly and the girl beamed. \"Wonderful, I'm Hailey Carter. She isnevery excited to meet you, come with me\" Helpless and confused and what else to do, Eddie let Hailey pull him downnthe hallway. \"Where are we going?\" Eddie asked as they came upon a bignwhite door with a tiny window slit at the top. Hailey turned and stared atnhim with her big sea green eyes. \"You mean you don't know?\" When Eddienshook his head, Hailey pouted. \"Most people don't know, but I did. I knewnright away\" She seemed sad so Eddie stroked a hand down her fine dark goldnhair. \"Knew what Hailey?\" She didn't answer for a moment. \"That I was dead,nlike you are, and like her\" Hailey said as she pointed to an old ladynwalking past them. Eddie felt shock waves travel through him at amazing speeds as he lookedndown at Hailey and a thought struck him. Had he seen her on the street, henwould think that she were a normal happy girl. \"I think there's been somenmistake, see, I'm not dead\" Hailey sighed and ran a hand through her ownnhair that was almost comically grown up for a child her age. \"It's a bitnmuch to take in at first I know, but you'll come to realize in time\" Eddienshook his head. \"I think I must have hit my head on something\" He said asnhe rubbed the back of his head and looked down at Hailey who was regardingnhim with such bloody patience. \"Alright then,\" He said after a length of time. \"If I'm dead, then how didnI die?\" Hailey pushed open the door but didn't go in, nor she did shenprompt Eddie to. \"You were hit by a car, also you suffered from bloodnrejection at the hospital\" The dark clouds that seemed to be gathering innthe doorway swirled and suddenly separated and Eddie could see Jane beingnlowered in a chair by a handsome doctor in a white coat that was rolled upnto the elbows and smeared with blood. She was crying and Liz gathered herninto her arms while they cried together. \"I want to go see her\" Eddie said to Hailey but she shook her small head.n\"You will have to talk to Gretchen Morris before you're allowed to visitnearth again. But I was told that yours was a special case, so I'm not surenhow she will deal with you\" Hailey pointed a delicate finger down the hallnto the second room on the left and Eddie, without asking, went there andnpulled the door open. Of all the things he had expected to see, he didn'tnexpect a pretty woman about 20 at the most with free flowing hair andnvibrant burnished gold eyes sitting behind a very business like desk with anset expression on her young face that was the color of strawberries andncream. \"Are you Gretchen?\" He asked unsurely, a smile tipped the corners of hernunpainted mouth. \"Yes I am,\" It was strange to Eddie how her voice seemednto echo and bounce off the stark white walls. \"I was told to come talk tonyou\" She rose from behind the desk and Eddie was surprised to see that shenbarely came up to his shoulders. \"You have a troubled soul Eddie,\" She saidnin a voice softened with sympathy. \"You have unfinished business\" Eddienwanted to laugh but he guessed that this wasn't the kind of thing that younwere supposed to laugh at. \"You wouldn't happen to know what it is wouldnyou.\" He asked with a hint of sarcasm that Gretchen didn't seem to catch onnto. \"I do, yes\" She took his palm and stroked her long lean fingers over thenlines in his palm. \"You have yet to find your true love\" Eddie pulled awaynand looked at Gretchen angrily. \"I found my true love, her name is JanenGoodale\" Gretchen smiled softly and shook her head. \"You only think thatnshe is because you are tired to searching\" Eddie growled and Gretchen'snsmile just stretched a little wider. \"I know what makes you tick, so tonspeak, Mr.Alden\" Gretchen said and flipped her hair over her shoulder andnlet it cascade down her back like an ebony waterfall. \"I've had a talk with your inner-cupid,\" She said as she paced the room inna manner that had Eddie gaping. Gretchen wasn't walking around the room atnall; she was more floating 7 inches off the ground. Her summer green dressndrifted at her bare heels and Eddie found himself being more confused bynthe minute. \"It seems that he is unsatisfied, so until you find you're truenlove and make the choice, you can not stay here in Heaven\" Eddie began tonlaugh uncontrollably. Gretchen simply leaned back against the desk andnwaited for him to compose himself. \"This is Heaven and next I suppose thatnyou're going to tell me that you're God\" \"What if I tell you that I am?\" She asked softly and that only caused Eddiento throw himself into a more violent laughing fit. She was very still tillnhe stopped and when he did, she calmly regarded him with her pretty eyesnand made him feel very uncomfortable very quickly. \"Firstly God is supposednto be a man\" He said as he wagged his finger at Gretchen's crepe dress.n\"Old wives stories, they like to blame a man when something goes wrong,nit's easier for them then to blame themselves I guess\" Eddie rolled hisneyes, easily dismissing what Gretchen had said. \"And secondly,\" He went onnas if she had never said anything in the first place. \"You look nothingnlike God. I mean you're floating and all and that's kind of freaky but younwant me to believe that you're the one that billions of people pray to?\" \"You never did\" Gretchen said easily with a hint of accusation in hernvoice. Eddie shook his head though Gretchen caught the flush that startednto creep up his cheeks. \"I have a belief that people need to takenresponsibility for their own actions\" Gretchen turned her back to him andnstarted to ruffle through a stack of papers and handed him one with anpicture of a man about fifty with stone gray hair and dark eyes pinned tonit. \"Who's this?\" Eddie asked confused. \"Christopher Malone, SergeantnChristopher Malone actually. 49 years old, 4 children and one on the way tonbeing married. He prayed every night of his life but that didn't stop thenbullet from the gun\" Eddie's mouth turned into a sneer. \"That's right itndidn't\" Gretchen took the paper from him and set it back down with infinitencare. \"Yes, but he came here to stay instead of having to go back andnfinish like you have to\" There was a brilliant flash of light and Eddie was in the hallway againnwith Hailey gripping his hand again. \"How did it go?\" She asked and Eddienjust looked down at her blankly. Hailey smiled a pretty little girl smilenof innocence and gently tugged Eddie down the hall. \"Will I be able to seenJane?\" He asked and Hailey looked up at him with shock running through herneyes. \"Did Gretchen not tell you?\" Eddie seemed puzzled. \"Well she told menthat since I have 'unfinished business' that I have to go down and finishnit, but that's really it\" Pity stirred inside Hailey's eyes and she didn'tnbother to mask it. \"Since you walked into Gretchen Morris's office, onenhundred years have passed and Jane is no longer living\" Eddie jumped back. \"Then isn't she here?\" This time Hailey only shook hernhead. \"No. Well she is, but she is kept so that neither of you will be ablento find one another\" Eddie clenched his teeth and growled impatiently atnthe little girl who was actually nearly 238 years old. \"What would I havento do to get this unfinished business taken care of?\" He asked almostnangrily and Hailey walked him a little ways down the hallway to a thick oakndoor that stood out with it gleaming brown against the stark white walls.n\"Walk through this door and you will be inside you're apartment 100 yearsnfrom now. However, you can only travel 60,000 miles from the apartment\" Deciding that 60,000 miles would give him good coverage, he nodded. \"Nownremember,\" Hailey said as he pulled the door open and gave her anquestioning glance. \"If you fall in love with her and she falls in lovenwith you, then you MUST tell her the truth\" Eddie seemed to weigh thenoptions. \"What if I don't find the love of my life?\" \"Then you will remainnearth bound until you do. If your love is strong enough to withhold thentruth, then you will have to make a very important decision\" Nodding, Eddientook a step forward and looked over the edge of the doorway, nothing butnblank empty space. Then with a final breath, he took the last steps intonthe doorway, and then the door slammed behind him. Plunging him intondarkness and space.[Chapter 4] The first thing that shocked Eddie was that he was back inside hisnold apartment. Then he began to notice the not so little things, like hownit had a different air to it, and the mountains of brown boxes that werenscattered and piled upon one another all through out the loft. There was ansound of ruffling coming from within the cavernous boxes and Eddie followednthe sound. What he didn't expect to see was a woman with tight ringlets ofnpale marigold framing her determined face fighting with tape from on of thenboxes. A chuckle escaped Eddie's mouth before he could prevent it and thenwoman looked up sharply. \"Who are you?\" She demanded, trying to feel for the box cutter fornprotection, but since it was by Eddie's feet; he simply bent down andnpocketed it in his jeans to put it in a place the woman probably wouldn'tngo right away. \"Eddie Alden\" He said easily and shifted his stance so thatnthe cutter wasn't digging into his thigh. Her Cupid's bow mouth which wasnalready driving Eddie crazy pulled into a little pout. \"Did my brother sendnyou here to scare me?\" She asked and sat on her heels to look up at Eddie.nA little confused, Eddie shook his head. \"No darlin',\" He said in a slowndrawl. \"I don't know you're brother\" Fear began to creep into her eyes. \"Sonthen Ty didn't send you?\" She asked again. \"As I said, I don't know yournbrother\" She was up like a shot and darting past him. Before he could think of whatnelse to do, he started after her then winced when the box cutter gouged atnhis leg, he stopped it yank it out of his pocket which gave the woman annadvantage, not that she needed it, she could run like a rabbit. When henfound her, she was in what used to be his bedroom, picking up the cordntelephone and rapidly dialing a barrage of numbers. She froze when Eddiencame in the room and he slowly took the receiver from her hand and placednit back in the cradle. \"Please don't kill me\" She pleaded as she lowered herself to the bed. Eddienwas confused until he remembered that he still had the box cutter in hisnhand. On the brink of amused and disgusted, he tossed it across the room.n\"I'm not going to kill you. Why would I?\" She seemed confused. \"I don'tnknow, do you people need a motive these days?\" He smiled and gave her anvery obvious once-over and he noticed that she deliberately crossed hernlegs. He rolled his eyes. \"I'm not going to rape you either so you cannrelax. What's your name?\" She nervously began to play with an end of one ofnher curls. \"Caitlyn, Caitlyn Murphy\" Eddie smiled and it made Caitlyn's heart flutter a little. \"Well CaitlynnMurphy, I'm not going to kill, rape or even hurt you. See this used to benmy apartment.\" He took the time to thoroughly examine her now. Flawlessnskin that was the color of pale Italian gold, big glittering eyes that hensupposed got him the most, the sleek feline green, he supposed this was sonbecause although he had known a million women with green eyes before, henhad never met one with the pure green, they had always had flecks of bluenor gold or gray, but her eyes were only the catty green. A long lean bodynthat he decided would feel good underneath him. He shook his head andndecided that that was an annoyance for another day. Added to it round softnlooking breasts and long tapered artist fingers that were tipped withnneatly manicured nails. She made quiet the package. \"Well this is my apartment now,\" Caitlyn said tilting her head to the sidenso she looked like royalty dismissing a peasant. \"So I am asking you nicelynto leave\" Eddie smiled and Caitlyn began to feel a bit helpless. Shenswitched and toyed with the end of her baby pink tank top that she slept innand was cut low to reveal hints of her creamy gold cleavage not that Eddienminded much, just because he was dead didn't mean that he didn't have thensame urges that he did when he was alive. A small frown crossed his mouth.nIt was those damn urges that got him in all this trouble in the firstnplace. \"I wish I could leave Duchess,\" Eddie said slowly and picked up anshiny red apple from a bowl \"But I have orders that I can't leave thenapartment\" It was a lie but Caitlyn would never know. \"Who do you havenorders from?\" Eddie's smile became thin. \"Gretchen Morris\" He said andnpointed upwards.n \"I think you must have hit your head on something on the way over here\"nEddie smiled. He remembered thinking that himself. \"Maybe,\" He said,ngetting an idea in his head, clutching his head, he stumbled and lurchednslightly. Being a naïve, Caitlyn rushed to help him keep his balance. \"Younshould come lie down\" She cooed to him and Eddie grinned to himself. Sheneased him, or tried to since he was about a foot taller and 50 poundsnheavier then she, into a plush pale blue couch that smelled faintly likengingerbread. \"Thank you,\" Eddie murmured into one of the pillows andndecided now was as good a time as any to get some sleep. Caitlyn took the time to take a step back and evaluate the man who hadnsuddenly appeared in her apartment and was now sleeping contently on herncouch. She wasn't going to pretend that he wasn't an interesting prospectnbecause he was. He had the tall dark and handsome thing going on that shencould definitely appreciate and the knock at the door brought Caitlyn backnbefore she realized that she was already getting a crush on the mysteriousnand a bit touched man. She turned to unbolt the door and pulled it open tonsee Ty Murphy's insultingly handsome face. \"How's my baby sister doing?\" He asked with his cocky and somehow arrogantnsmile that he never lost from childhood. \"I'm great,\" She squealed as shenjumped into his arms. \"Why didn't you tell me that New York was such annamazing place?\" Ty laughed a rich rolling sound that Caitlyn loved tonlisten to and set her safely back onto the floor of the apartment. \"Not sonmuch like Georgia now is it?\" He asked and she blushed slightly. \"Even thenpeople are different, a strange man showed up in my apartment about half annhour ago out of no where. He said it was his old apartment\" Ty seemed tonfreeze. \"Well Caitlyn did you call the police?\" He demanded and whennCaitlyn just gave him a bland look he shook her quickly. \"This isn'tnSavannah anymore sweetheart; it isn't just a safe place\" He pulled out his cell phone to dial 911 but Caitlyn put a gentle hand onnhis wrist. \"I know that Ty, but don't you think that he were going to rapenor kill me he would have done it by now? Besides he's sleeping on thencouch\" Ty rolled his eyes that were a shade of smoky money green comparednto Caitlyn's and for some reason that she would never be able tonunderstand, girls loved his eyes. Not that the rest of his was bad, he hadna tall lean frame and was surprisingly strong for someone who sat behind andesk all day. He dyed his sunny blonde hair to a dark brown because henclaimed blonde was 'juvenile' yet he always kept it neatly cut and hisnfingers always seemed to be manicured His skin was a darker gold then hersnand when he got angry, as he was now, his Italian accent deepened andnalways made heads turn. He gave Caitlyn the illusion of an Italian princenwho had just stepped out of a story book and into an Armani suit. \"He'snstill here?\" He shook his head \"Honestly Catie do you want to be murderednon the second day here?\" Caitlyn pouted prettily and Ty hissed out anbreath. \"You never did have any common sense. Has he tried to do anything?\"n\"No,\" Caitlyn said and gently fingered that apple that Eddie had left onnthe counter. Ty stormed from out of the kitchen to the living room and saw Eddie'snsleeping frame curled in the couch. He was a good 4 inches taller then Ty,nbut lean and more sleek looking, almost feral. Like the Devil's son. Tynsmiled to himself. The Devil's Son was a the first thing that Caitlyn hadnpainted, the painting of the man with burning dark eyes and black as nightnhair as flames swirled around him was the first one accepted by Gulliver'snto be hung on the walls of the prestigious art house, however not the last.nIt seemed like a million years ago that Caitlyn was a 15 year-old girlncovered in head to toe with paint or god knows what else while she gigglednwith her best friend Lara Wilkes, who Ty ended up marrying. A pretty thingnwith a cap of starry black hair and a brilliant smile, Ty was absolutely innlove with her. He had come to tell Caitlyn that Lara was pregnant, but henhad other things on his mind due to Abby's trusting nature. Eddie stirred in his deep sleep and murmured something that Ty couldn'tnhear, but brought his attention back to Eddie from his daydreamy travelnback in time. He was a handsome bugger, he had to give him that, but Tynstill didn't plan to trust him. He loved his sister, but Caitlyn had alwaysnhad her head up in the clouds. When their mother died and their father hadngone into a recluse, it had been Ty's job to pay the bills and auditorsnwhile Caitlyn brought home every stray puppy and wounded bird she couldnfind. When he left for New York to pursue a career as lawyer, he supposednthat the house would be full of animals and Abby would be living withoutnhot water or electricity, seeing as how she would never pay the bills onntime. It was too early for Ty to be terribly annoyed by Eddie, so he simplynturned on his heels and walked back into the kitchen where Caitlyn wasnsipping a glass s of white wine. No matter what the situation, from eithernchanging a car tire in the middle of Nowhere Nevada or sitting at thenopera, Caitlyn could always be classy. \"Do whatever you want with him\" Tynsaid temperamentally, but if he puts a toe out of line, send him over tonme\" He bent and scribbled his address on a napkin and handed it to Caitlyn.n\"Alright but you'd have to come here,\" She said a she tucked the napkin innthe pocket of her jeans. \"Why?\" Caitlyn sighed as if the answer werenobvious. \"Just because,\" Caitlyn began to make something up quickly so thatnhe wouldn't think she was totally insane. \"He really hit his head, andntraveling downtown might be bad for him\" Ty rolled his eyes in exasperationnand left. Slightly irritated by the visit of her brother, she rummaged through thenkitchen and pulled out a pan to make some breakfast. Eddie woke to thenintoxicating smell of eggs and bacon sizzling in a frying pan. He uncurlednhimself from the surprisingly comfortable couch and followed the sound ofnCaitlyn singing softly to herself. He didn't know the song but he liked thensound of her voice as she sang it. Soft and almost heartbreakingly sad, butnit had a silky texture that the ear couldn't deny. He found her standingnover a skillet with a spatula in hand, expertly flipping sunny side eggs.nHe smiled at the glass of wine that was half empty and beaded withnperspiration from the coolness of the air. \"A little early to start drinking don't you think?\" He asked with a smirk.nShe glanced up at him, sleep agreed with him, the hollows in his cheeksnwere gone as well as the bags from under his eyes. \"In New York, I didn'tnknow anyone stopped\" Eddie laughed and Caitlyn had to smile as it was anfriendly sound. \"So,\" He said as he leaned against the counter that thencool gray marble had replaced the black wood. \"Are you going to make mensome breakfast or make me beg?\" Caitlyn grinned and flipped the eggs andnbacon onto the plates to accompany the toast. \"Well I would make you beg if I were mean, but I'm feeling charitablentoday. Would you like coffee, or maybe some wine to drink?\" \"Coffee'snfine,\" He said and settled himself into watching Caitlyn move about thenkitchen. She poured the coffee into a plum color mug with a small chip onnthe handle and passed it to him. Taking a sip, he decided that Abby was thenonly one he ever wanted to make his coffee again. When she set two platesnonto the counter, he grinned and knew that the eggs were just out of thenpan and steaming hot, but the fragrance they gave out made him want to riskna scalded tongue. \"Did you just move to New York?\" Eddie asked as he dashed salt onto theneggs which had more to do with habit then with the flavor of the eggs,nwhich was exceptional. \"Yeah, from Savannah Georgia,\" She said as she tookna sip of her wine. \"My brother Tyler, or Ty is what we call him, he came upnabout two years before me, he's a lawyer now over at Jarred and Kaminski\"nEddie had no idea who Jarred or Kaminski was and didn't care was, but hennodded as if he did. \"Kind of a difference in areas don't you think?\" Henasked as he watched Caitlyn over the rim of his cup. \"Well yes,\" She said as she seemed to examine the question. \"The pace isnGeorgia was slower, even if you visited Atlanta it wasn't as busy asnManhattan. At first I wanted to move to California, Redlands, maybe LosnAngeles, to kind of ease my way into the rush of it all, y'know to kind ofnget my feet wet, but from what Ty had been telling me of New York City, Injust had to jump right in. What about you? Did you always live in New York?nI know that some people live in Brooklyn or Long Island and they don'tnreally consider it New York because well...\" Eddie grinned from ear to ear. God she was cute. Sophisticated when shenwanted to be and just innocent enough to be insanely sexy and irresistiblyncute at the same time. \"No, I've never lived in New York at all actuallyntill I was 17, when I was little, only about 8 or 9 years old, my Dad movednus from smack in the middle of Clinton Missouri where at most there aren3,500 to Manhattan where there are 204,000 and it seems like all of themnare out on the streets at the same time, but it was great and I guess Inadjusted right away because when the family moved back when I was 17, Instayed here and it's here I've been ever since\" He didn't consider the factnthat he was dead and in Heaven for 100 years before he got back to New Yorknto be a lie. \"I've been here two days,\" She said as she paused to take a sip of coffee.n\"And I love it, it's amazing\" Eddie smiled at her and Caitlyn had to fightnto keep her hands still. Eddie examined her face and nodded. \"So farnconcrete and steel agree with you. I used to go to the New York PublicnLibrary for hours-\" He stopped when he remembered that 100 years had passednby, and the Library had probably been closed or run down for years. ButnCaitlyn just keep looking at him and smiling patiently, like she knew whatnhe was talking about. \"And read whatever I could get my hands on. SometimesnI wouldn't even check out a book, it would just sit in one of those bignvery comfortable chairs by the window and just read\" Caitlyn nodded. \"It was something like that in Georgia, only instead ofnstaring into another building, we saw grass and trees and this lovelynlittle stream that snaked by\" Eddie watched her as she talked, she rarelyngesticulated with her hands, which he found that New York women did, butnCaitlyn sat very proper, head level and her beautiful hair framing her facenthat some would call angelic, but Eddie had an idea that when she wasnpassionate about something, there wasn't anything angelic about it. \"Well,\"nEddie said and shifted his position. \"I found that if you sit in the rightnspot on the top floor, you can see this patch of woods and a little rivernor whatever\" Caitlyn smiled, making her amazing eyes seemingly glow. \"Tell me about yournfamily\" Eddie said abruptly. Caitlyn seemed a little taken back, but oncenshe regained her composure, she grinned quickly and gave Eddie an idea of anpixie about to play a prank. \"Well I'm Italian right?\" She asked and Eddiendidn't know what else to do but nod. \"Well, Italian women are supposed tonmarry young and pop out babies. My aunt is the best cook in the family, sonfor Christmas which is a huge deal for us by the way, and all the men do isneat and eat and degrade women, and the women sit around and sip coffee andntalk about how gross men are. It's wonderful\" Eddie grinned. \"How many brothers or sisters do you have?\" Caitlyn sighednthrough a grin. \"Well let's see now,\" She spread out her fingers of hernright hand and began. \"There is Jonathan, at 35 which makes him the oldestnand the owner of the restaurant in Atlanta, then there are the triplets,nOliver, Danny and Christina, they're 30, then there's Ty who's 28, thennthere is Isadora and Julia, 10 months apart, they're both 25 from eachnother if you can believe it, and there's me, then there are the twinsnLindsey and Tim. So not including me, I have seven brothers and sisters\"nEddie seemed a little shocked. \"Wow, I was thinking maybe two or three\"nCaitlyn laughed and shook her head which made her curls dance. \"Haha, you'd like that wouldn't you? Oh! And they're all married. So let'sncount all of them as well. Jonathan married Quinn, Oliver married Evita,nDanny married Iris, Christina married Jim Donovan, Ty married my bestnfriend Lara, Isadora married Geoffrey Winters, and Julie married LucasnCarpenter, Tim whose 19 married his high school girlfriend Penelope, but wenall call her Penny, and Lindsey is getting married this fall to this reallyngreat guy she met named Adam Franconi. I am the only one in my family whonisn't married. All of them are scattered over the country now except fornJonathan who still lives in Georgia. But we all get together at someone'snhouse for Christmas, this year we're supposed to go to Oliver and Evita'snhouse and ranch in North Carolina, so everyone is going to cram there andnbring however many children they might have\" Eddie smiled at the sweet flush that was riding on Caitlyn's cheeks whennshe finished. \"You adore your family though\" He said after a while and tookna sip of the cooling coffee. \"Of course I do. Tell me about your family,nbrothers and sisters\" Eddie paused for a moment and smiled. \"I only haventwo younger siblings, my brother Jamie who's 25 and my sister Rose who justnturned 23. Jamie got married three years ago to a pretty French girl namednAnnabelle, and had kids, two girls named Sarah and Amelie And Rose isn'tnmarried because she is in fact a lesbian, but she does have a girlfriend,nNicole\" Caitlyn stifled a laugh but when Eddie smiled she decided that henwouldn't be offended if she laughed. Not that she found that sort of thingnfunny, but the way that he said it made her want to smile. Caitlyn laughed and Eddie tried to convince himself not to notice how allnthe features that were already perfect about Caitlyn became even morenobvious. Her pixie-nose wrinkled and her pretty mouth curved, even hernhands looked more delicate looking when she laughed. He quickly shooknhimself from his dreaming about her and tried to compose himself. \"I wantnto take you somewhere,\" Caitlyn said suddenly and grabbed Eddie's hand. Shennearly hauled him to his feet as she was stronger then she looked and tooknhim to the door. As she examined his clothes, she determined that the loosenblack slacks and the gray shirt looked alright on him, but it would neverndo for where they were going to be. \"Scratch that, make it two places,\"nCaitlyn murmured and pulled Eddie out the door.[Chapter 5] Judging by Caitlyn's character, Eddie supposed that she would have a sweetnand homely car, something childishly bright and annoying, or somethingnflashy and ostentatious. So he was shocked when he saw her pull out thenclicker for the stream-line Honda S2000, but the color fitted Caitlyn, itnmatched her smooth style and also her playfulness as the car was the deepnglittering amethyst. Normally Eddie would have worried about being drivennin a purple car, but he was too busy to worry about that, the car wasnrunning so smoothly it barely seemed as if they were driving at all, ratherngliding across glass. Caitlyn looked so pretty drenched in the early morning sunlight that henfigured that if she looked any more perfect that his heart would stop andnhe would die on the spot. She stopped the car and turned to grin at him. Atnthat moment with the golden sunlight slanting over the both of the, Eddienfelt the said heart do a few quick and jerky flip flops. \"Here we are,\" Shensaid as she unlocked the doors. Eddie looked suspicious as he looked up andninto the windows of a men's and women's designer clothes store. \"You've gotnto be kidding me\" He said as Caitlyn looped her arm with him, half for thenintimacy she felt with him, and the other half to keep him from bolting asnshe knew he would if he were given the chance. \"It's not so bad,\" She murmured to him softly as she guided him into thenstore. \"Why are we even here?\" Eddie asked like a distempered smile thatnmade Caitlyn smile. \"I have a gallery meeting tonight at 7 and I need andate. The press there will be hanging all on if I brought a date, but if Inbring someone who looks like you. well then they will never leave\". Eddiengrinned internally. No matter the generation that he might be living in, henstill had the grit that drew women towards him. \"Alright,\" He said slowlynas they began to stroll through the isles. \"What are you going to wear?\" He asked, trying to make it should like annormal conversation. She shrugged a slim golden shoulder that the tank topnleft mostly bare. \"I haven't decided yet. Back in Savannah they didn't carenwhat you wore, but this isn't Savannah anymore is it?\" Before waiting for anreply, Caitlyn was nearly dragging Eddie till they can upon suits. She mustnhave pressed a million suits that ranged from black to a pale pink, whichncaused Eddie to promise Abby that if she bought that for him and made himnwear it, he would kill her. He was about to tell her that he had a suit innthe apartment and at the risk of sounding crazy he wisely shut his mouthnand let Abby have her fun. After about the 37th suit, Caitlyn let out a yip of joy and thrust the suitnin question to Eddie and motioned to the dressing rooms which were a littlensinister looking for Eddie's taste, but to please Abby he took the suit andnbegan to put it on. It was the color of charcoal and Eddie liked the way itnfelt between his fingers as he ran them over the lapel. When he was dressednhe examined himself closely in the mirror. He looked good. DAMN good hisnmind corrected and he began to wonder if he could sweet talk a hot showernbefore the gallery. When he stepped out of the dressing rooms and his eyesnnearly popped out of his head. She no longer looked like the sweet Caitlynnfrom 5 minutes ago. She looked like a blonde Hollywood bombshell for then1930's in the angelically breezy dress that stopped just above the knee. The dress in question was valentine pink. The smooth color against thenstriking liquid gold skin made Eddie's mouth want to water. If her hair hadnbeen longer, she would have reminded Eddie of Veronica Lake, a beautifulnactress who had died in the 1970's, so Eddie knew that if he had told Abbynabout this, she would think that he was totally crazy. When Caitlyn noticednhis intense gaze, she began to feel a little nervous. \"Do you like it?nBecause I can keep looking if you don't like it, I just thought that-n\"Before she could finish, Eddie smoothly held up a hand. \"I love it. Itnlooks amazing on you\" The flattery fluttered in Caitlyn's stomach and shenblushed sweetly. After they had bought the suits and they had re-entered Caitlyn'snapartment, Eddie had began to feel the wear catching up to him. \"HeynDuchess,\" He said in an exhausted voice. When Caitlyn turned to him withnunflinching brightness, he winced. \"Do you have a shower around?\" \"No,nthere are no showers anywhere\" She said it so straight-forward and blandlynthat Eddie began to think that someone had ripped up the showers. When henonly continued to stare, Caitlyn laughed. \"I'm only kidding with you.nThey're there\" Eddie's gaze followed where Caitlyn's finger was pointingnand he nearly sighed. They hadn't moved from when he had lived there. He set the water on full cold and tried not to scream by clenching hisnteeth to the point he thought that they would break. He scrubbed at hisnskin and lathered his long body with the creamy green soap that smellednsoftly like the woods behind his old house in Clinton. Once he stepped outnof the shower, he wrapped up in a towel and used another to dry his hair.nFeeling ultimately refreshed, he looked in the mirror and noticed thenstubble that was growing around his strong jaw. He ran a hand over it andndetermined that he could live with the scruffy look until he was able tonfind a way to get a razor. Caitlyn was sitting on the faded blue couch reading a magazine when Eddienwalked out of the shower. \"That's a good color on you\" She said with anlaugh as she looked up. Eddie was confused for a moment before he realizednthat she was talking about the bubblegum pink towel draped around hisnwaist. \"Thanks, it's been my dream to be able to pull off this color\" Hensaid with a grin. \"Looks good anyway. Have a good shower?\" He nodded. \"Thensystem is a little out dated, well that's a lie, but if it works and hasnhot water I don't care\" \"So what is this gallery this about?\" He asked as he ran a hand through hisndamp hair, sending scattering raindrops of whatever everywhere. Caitlynntook her time as she turned a page in the magazine. \"Have you heard of thenMillistine?\" She asked him. \"No\" Eddie said and was pleased that he didn'tnhave to lie. She set down the magazine and patted the seat next to her.n\"Well it's this corporation and every year they hold an art gallery partynat Gulliver's, and it's pretty much mandatory that I go\" Eddie was morenthen a little confused. \"Why?\" He asked. \"Because they're show casing mynart\" He smiled slowly. \"Oh, so this is like a party for you\" She had to smile.n\"Well yes and for the other artists, people are able to buy severelynoverpriced pieces of the art and if I get lucky tonight then maybe I'll benable to decorate the apartment like I've wanted to\" Eddie grinned at her.n\"Are you any good?\" He asked, though by the look of Caitlyn's long taperednfingers he already knew the answer. \"I'm not bad, but I suppose that Incould be better. I've been painting ever since I was like 10 years old\" Shenlooked down at the magazine and up through her eyelashes. A purely femininenlook that made Eddie's heart skip a beat or two. \"Oh so you're like an artist?\" She stared at him blandly, her eyes swirlingnwith both amusement and slight annoyance. \"I'm not like an artist, I AM annartist\" She corrected. He grinned. \"Swell\" He said cheekily as he pretendednnot to notice the odd stare that Caitlyn was giving him. \"I wish I couldnpaint,\" Eddie said vaguely. \"I can't really do anything\" She raised a slimneyebrow and the corners of her lush lips twitched into a smile. \"I bet you can, you just need to find it,\" She said and hooked their armsntogether on the couch and smiled up at him. He wanted to run his fingersnthrough the butter-soft curls and feel her skin beneath his fingers, but henknew it wouldn't be wise, not yet. \"So,\" Caitlin said and battered hernpretty eyes at him as she rested against the strength of his arm. \"As soonnas I can muster enough will go get up off you're arm because it'snsurprisingly comfy, I'm going to forgo a shower because I took one thisnmorning, and I'm going to slip my ass into that dress and once you getndressed, or even if you don't, we're going to dazzle everyone there\" Eddienlaughed as she disappeared behind the bedroom door and he tried not tonimagine her stripping off her clothes, it worked for a while, he didn'tnimagine her peeling her clothes off, he imagined himself peeling off thenthin layer of silk that separated him from heaven.[Chapter 6] She emerged from the bathroom in a cloud of fragrant steam. Smelling ofnchocolate, Caitlyn blew him a saucy kiss, snagged the dress off the rack,nand went into her room, well actually it used to be Jane's room, Eddienthought darkly and flipped a little angrily through the magazine henrealized he had been strangling in his hands. Eddie had to restrain himselfnfrom wandering \"innocently\" into the bedroom and taking her in his armsnand.Well he shouldn't think about that, but the idea was definitelynappealing. Caitlyn was eyeing herself in the mirror while Eddie suffered through hisnhorrible mental battle, going through her own battle of her own. Her dampnhair hung in loose curls around her face, mouth slightly pouted a sugarynpink and the new dress clung to her like a second skin and fanned out atnthe bottom like a mermaid's tail. Her mind kept wandering back to Eddie,nhow everything about him was perfect, despite the fact he was slightlynweird. His smile could melt an iceberg and had wonderfully dark intenseneyes. She shook her head as if to clear out the heavy fog and shuffledntowards the door. Eddie had his to her as she opened the door and she tiptoed up behind himnand clapped her hands over his eyes. \"Guess who\" She breathed in his ear.n\"Jane?\" He asked before he could stop himself. Caitlyn stepped back and anpout crossed her lips. \"Who's Jane?\" She asked sulkily and Eddie wishednthat he could find a hole to crawl in to. \"A girl I used to know, a longntime ago\" Caitlyn eyed him for a long minute. \"What happened to her?\" Eddiencouldn't meet Caitlyn's eyes. \"She died\" \"I'm sorry,\" Caitlyn murmured and this inexplicably put Eddie in a badnmood. \"Why did you do it?\" She blinked reproachfully at him and he grabbednthe jacket that was hanging off the back of a chair. \"Come on, we don'tnwant to be late now do we?\" She seemed to hesitate before following himntowards the door, the smooth material whispered against her ankles as thenheels as the door closed behind her. He was waiting a little ways down the hall looking slightly disgruntled andnvery handsome. \"Come on cowboy\" She said as she took him by the hand andnignored it when he rather stiffened. She had spent too much time around hernbrothers and family to worry about bruised male egos. Her heels clickedneerily in the garage. The car was still gleaming prettily in the fadingnsunlight that was filtering through the cement of the parking garage. Eddie was quiet while he listened to the purr of the engine until Caitlynnflicked on the stereo in the car. Doris Day's pretty voice flittered out ofnthe small speakers but it sounded as if she were singing right next to himnand into his ear. \"You like Doris Day?\" He asked and Caitlyn looked at himnas if she forgot he was in the car. \"Yeah, don't you?\" He nodded. \"Yeah ofncourse I do, but Doris Day was before your time\" She gave him a rather oddnlook. \"Yours too\". Eddie could only stare when Caitlyn began singing alongnwith the radio. She had such a beautiful pure voice that it boggled him. Henthought voices like that died with the Sirens. They pulled up in front a tall beautiful building that was flanked withnskylights and red velvet ropes. Eddie decided that the old tradition ofnoveracting to such events as this, but he decided that Caitlyn deserved it.nShe came up behind him, linked their fingers in easy companionship, and letnhim lead her into the building. They stepped inside and Eddie's jaw nearlyndropped to the floor. Almost every wall was covered by painting or charcoalndrawings with talent Eddie would have done anything for. \"You did allnthese?\" He whispered in her ear and she looked up at him and grinned. \"Yup\" Caitlyn and Eddie winded through the crowd and smiled politely but Eddiennoticed that the smile didn't reach her amazing catty eyes. \"You really getna kick out of this don't you?\" Eddie asked her as she watched a prettynbrunette beg her husband for the painting of the long stemmed black rosenthat looked like blood red silk was pouring from within the petals. \"Ofncourse I do, but it's not the money Eddie, it's the thrill of knowing thatnsomething I painted is making someone happy and then I love knowing thatnI'll get to paint or draw something else\" \"You never said anything aboutnmoney\" Eddie said looking at her with a raised eyebrow. \"Money has never really interested me; I mean it's nice to have when younneed it, but most of the times it's a hassle, I don't need anymorencomplications in my life. Come with me\" She added as if it were an afternthought. She gripped his hand and pulled him to the middle of the room.nBefore Eddie asked what she was going to do, she had gotten up on the veryntip of her toes and placed a long hot kiss on his mouth. She heard him sucknin a breath of surprise before he began to nibble softly on her bottom lip. There was a clucking of tongues from a group of blue-haired old women asnthey hurried along. Caitlyn could have gone on kissing him until the moonnfell from the sky and shattered like glass over the water, and Eddie wouldnhave happily let her, but a woman with shoulder length black hair and tawnyneyes came and tapped Eddie on the shoulder gingerly. \"Hi,\" She began anlittle meekly when Caitlyn and Eddie broke away and Eddie looked down atnher with his intense dark eyes. \"This might sound a little weird, but Inthink I've seen a ghost because you look just like Eddie Alden\" Caitlyn blinked once hard and looked up at Eddie. \"Who are you?\" He asked anlittle too sharply and made the girl flinch. \"My name is Lucy Goodale-nCleese; can I talk to you for a minute?\" The rest of the world seemed tondrain away, all he could hear was the last name 'Goodale'. Eddie took Lucynby the arm and led her away from Caitlyn and the others who were all givingnhim an odd look. \"You're not related to Jane Goodale are you? Not thenscientist but the journalist?\" Lucy nodded. \"Yeah she's my greatngrandmother, she gave birth to my mom Mia and she had me, see I thought Inwas seeing a ghost because my grandmother had pictures of this guy namednEddie Alden all over her apartment. I think it's kind of weird that wenwould meet since we both have this weird thing in common\" Eddie shook his head. \"Look, Lucy is it? Do you want to get out of here?nIt's a little crowded in here and I need to tell you some things alright?\"nLucy nodded and she followed Eddie out of the open doors. He hoped Caitlynnhad not seen him leave, but it was something he had to risk,nunquestionably, she would be angry, but he would deal with that later, thenfact that he might have just met Jane's grand-daughter was freakishlynuncanny and something he couldn't pass up. They settled themselves at a little bistro that was no quiet but the staffnhad not taken in the deck chairs and they were still puttering about withnkettles of hot coffee for the late night patrons. \"You might think I'm mad,nand maybe I am because all this is getting a little too weird for me too,nbut I'm not related to Eddie Alden, I AM Eddie Alden\" Lucy burst outnlaughing. \"You're kidding right? I mean this has got to be some sort ofnjoke, lets say you were who you say you are, you would be like-\"\"132. Inknow it is crazy but I'm telling you the truth. What do I have to do tonprove it to you?\" Lucy got a gleam in her deep tawny eyes that henrecognized with a bit of shock and resolution. \"Sleep with me\" Lucy said asnshe took a sip of the ice water a seemingly invisible waiter had brought.nEddie didn't bother to let his jaw drop. \"If I do,\" He said as he toyednwith the ice in his own glass. \"Will you believe what I say is true?\" Lucynlaughed. \"Honey if you really are 132 years old and you can still get itnup; I'll believe anything you tell me\" Eddie looked over his shoulder to Gulliver's and Lucy and sighed. \"Fine,ncome on\" He said as he rose and picked up the jacket that was lying acrossnthe wrought iron table. Lucy got up after him with a sort of smile acrossnher unpainted lips. They walked down the lamp lit sidewalk and they turnednthe corner that would lead to Eddie's old apartment, he did not have to paynattention when Caitlyn was driving to know his way back, it was always innhis mind, what was his but no longer his, like Jane, and maybe afterntonight, Caitlyn Murphy as well.[Chapter 7] When Eddie opened the door in front of Lucy, the world seemed to spinnviolently and he could have sworn that the ground tilted up and plunged himninto clear very icy waters. He found himself standing in the middle ofnGretchen's office. Hailey was at his left and looking at him somewhatndisapprovingly. \"What?\" He asked her. She didn't say anything but took hisnhand in her small one and walked forward with him. She pressed a series ofnnumbers on the wall and a door soon opened. \"She's in there\" Eddie shuffled forward and relaxed a little at Gretchen's smile. Her hairnwas piled on top of her head with ornate twists and curls, her dress wasnpure white and something like a cello was playing off somewhere as Eddienrecognized as Bach's Cello Suite No.1. \"Life is a series to testsnMr.Alden,\" Gretchen said as she looked down at her desk and continued tonwrite something in a small notebook. \"What do you mean?\" Gretchen smilednonce more but didn't look up. \"The girl, Lucy Cleese, doesn't exist, thatnwas a friend of mine I sent down for a little mission, Jessica, will youncome in please?\" She asked the open doorway and the girl he thought hadnbeen Jane's granddaughter stepped through looking a little sheepish. \"None of what happened since you began kissing that young woman hasnactually happened at all,\" Jessica said in a Welsh accent carefullynavoiding his gaze. \"Then what have I been doing all this time?\" \"Wellnactually all that happened took place in matter of about 20 seconds, sonyou're still happily kissing her. I suggest that you let her get some airnthough\" Jessica said on a laugh and earned a look from Gretchen. \"I'm goingnto send you back now, but Eddie, before I let you go through the door, Inhave to give you a warning\" Eddie laughed a humorless sound. \"Now anwarning\" He muttered and Gretchen only waited patiently. \"It addressesnsomething that might be important to you, so I would listen very carefully,nuntil you do find your true love, you won't be able to be with other women\" Eddie's eyes widened dramatically. \"YOU DIDN'T CUT IT OFF DID YOU?!\" Henasked frantically and his hands immediately grabbed the crotch of hisnpants. Gretchen and Jessica laughed. \"No, it's all there, it just won'tnwork until you truly love her and she loves you, what this means is ifnyou're feeling frustrated, you just won't be able to pick up any girl younmeet, well, I mean I suppose you could but she won't leave very happy\" Thentwo women laughed again and Eddie glared at them a little maliciously. \"Inbet the both of you think this is all very funny\". Gretchen tried to compose her face but couldn't quite manage it. \"Of coursenI don't think that Eddie\" She said, but the smile was still tuggingnrelentlessly at her pretty lips. \"I think that\" Jessica admitted with anhuge grin and Gretchen ushered her from the room. \"Ok so, I won't be ablento sleep with anyone?\" \"That's right\" Eddie looked a tad distressed. \"Atnall?\" Gretchen gave into the smile. \"Not unless you're both in love, anynother questions?\" He hesitated a minute. \"Can I.well y'know.jack off?\"nGretchen raised a perfect eyebrow looking somewhere between amused andnconcerned. \"I think it's time that we get you back to the party; I'll benseeing you soon\". She placed a kiss on his cheeks and as he stepped out ofnthe room, the music of the cello's swelled to an almost deafening pitch andnhe tumbled through the clear icy water and back to the party for Caitlyn atnGulliver's. As soon as he fully returned and decided to enjoy the moment and begannkissing Caitlyn again, she jumped back as if she was given a hugenelectrical shock. \"What's wrong?\" He asked her and she shook her head.n\"Nothing, it just felt like a current ran through me\" She looked beautiful,nher hair mused from his hands and her eyes were huge and if possible, evennbrighter. A man in a perfect black suit and graying hair came up and tooknCaitlyn by the arm. \"Excuse me Miss Murphy, a few older clients are anlittle disgusted by your acts\" Caitlyn smiled up at him. \"What act? I lovenkissing him\" \"Yes well, may I be so bold as to ask you to um.stop?\" Shenseemed to consider this for a minute. \"You can, but I thought asking madenit optional\" The man sniffed once and spun on his heels. Eddie grinned down at Caitlyn.n\"I knew you had it in you?\" Caitlyn smiled with over exaggerated innocence.n\"Why whatever do you mean Edward?\" She asked and he kissed her forehead.nHow could someone actually be so cute without bursting into flames or anmountain of sugar? He took the opportunity to link their fingers andnwander around the glossy art house. The same music he had heard in Gretchen's office started playing overnhidden speakers and Eddie wondered if Gretchen saw the irony of it all.nCaitlyn turned and wrapped her arms around his neck as she got on herntiptoes. \"There's just something so sexy about seeing you in a crowd, Incould make love to you right now\" Eddie braced himself against the earthynsexual suggestions and took her by the shoulders gently and eased her back.n\"Why don't I get us something to drink?\" He asked and quickly left thensituation. Caitlyn stared at his back confused, she had moved to simplyngive him and hug and he was acting as if she were about to attack him. Hencertainly was odd, odd and appealing anyway. She found him halfway between her and the drinks; he was staring atnsomething on the wall. She came to his side and grinned up at it. \"That'snthe first thing I've seriously painted, it's called The Devil's Son\" Hennodded somewhat numbly. \"It looks like me,\" He said and Caitlyn lookednbetween the two. \"I suppose it does, wow, a lot, creepy\". She giggled anlittle and Eddie looked down at her. \"Sorry, I just think it's a littlenweird. This place is kind of stuffy isn't it?\" She asked as she put hernhands on her tiny hips. \"Yeah it is,\" Eddie agreed still looking up at thenpainting. \"Do you wanna get out of here then? Let's get something to eat,nI'm starving.\" He nodded and followed her out the glassy doors and onto the pavement. \"Inknow this little place, Ty told me about it, it's called O'Grady's. It's bynCarnegie Hall, it would be a bit of a walk but it's such a nice night Indon't feel like driving, and besides if you drive, I can give you anblowjob\" Eddie gave her an odd face. \"Unless.you don't like the weather,\"nShe said uncertainly. \"No, its fine, we'll walk I don't mind, come on, Inknow where O'Grady's is, it's good, you'll like it. Well, let's get goingnthen\" He entwined their fingers and began to walk and talking about nothingnat all.

Percy smiled back, nodding along to her words from his perch on his yeti's palm. \"Yeah!\" he agreed, patting his yeti's finger affectionately. There was the scratching of chatting in the background, their own human voices mixing with the gruff yetis'. He sighed. \"I just wish we knew what they were saying…\" Brenda's smile faded into a contemplating frown. \"Well,\" she said, \"I… might know someone who can help us.\" Scientists Begin to Search For Way to Communicate with Newly-Discovered Yetis! After startling discovery of a tribe of yetis made by Percy Pettersson, scientists all over the world have begun the search of finding a way to communicate with the creatures previously known only from myths. More at page 6. Migo squinted, using his hand to cover his eyes from the pale light inside of the large building. The whole affair was almost like stepping outside of his room on a particularly bright day, but these lights hurt more than the glaring snow and ice. Smallfoot – with a capital S, rather than all the other smallfeet – walked beside him, guiding him through the rooms and corridors. It was talking in its high-pitched tones, rambling excitedly about something or another. Truly, it was a shame that they didn't fully understand each other – one can only get so far with drawings on cave walls and wild hand gestures. Finally, after a walk that was uncomfortable merely because of how small every door was, they arrived at wherever they were supposed to be going. Smallfoot rushed over to another smallfoot, shaking its hand before gesturing towards Migo. The new smallfoot waved at him, and he uncertainly waved back. He trusted Smallfoot not to take him to someone harmful – it had protected him many times before, after all – and after a few minutes it became clear that no, this smallfoot didn't want to harm him. In fact, after a few confusing moments with more and more frantic hand-gesturing, Migo puzzled together that they – were trying to find easier ways to communicate? Oh, he was one hundred percent down for that. He accepted the examinations with ease, staying still even when he'd rather run out of there screaming. Communication With Yetis Possible? Scientists Are Uncertain. Weeks after the discovery of yetis scientists are still not sure whether true communication is possible or not. Their voice chords are, according to professor James Schmidt, \"vastly different from ours\", making a common language hard to find basis for. More at page 4. Percy stared at the wall in the cave, tugging at his hair in frustration. All their research was hung up on the stone wall, displayed in front of him in all their raw honesty – there were handwritten notes, newspaper clippings, prints of scientific papers, prints of messages and emails – and still, the gaps of lacking knowledge were far too many to count. By all means, every single test showed that a common ground was possible, despite the differences in their voice chords. He knew that yetis were smart enough to learn and understand new languages– the sceptics didn't believe him, of course, but there will always be sceptics and he'd accepted that… but still – A small grunt came from his yeti, who was resting against the other wall with his legs folded up against his chest. He'd been watching him work, as he at times did, fascinated by all his gadgets. Now the usually curious look had been replaced by a somewhat worried expression. Percy sighed, letting go of his hair and walking over to him with heavy steps. \"It's alright, big guy,\" he said, leaning against his leg and patting his knee comfortingly. \"We'll figure it out.\" His yeti made one of the noises Percy had learned was a happy noise, picking him up and placing him against his chest. Rather than complaining, Percy laughed and shook his head fondly. His yeti was in the habit of doing that, sometimes, and he didn't complain – it was rather comfortable, actually, his fur was soft and in the cold harshness of the winter the warmth was nice. Research For Communication at a Standstill – Scientists all Over the World Frustrated. Yet another attempt at communication has failed. It seems that, after weeks of research and close examinations, we have come to a standstill. We are simply not moving forward in our search for a common language – but Percy Pettersson, discoverer of the yeti, refuses to give up, insisting that \"there must be a way. And if there is none, I will make it!\". More at page 7. After the first contact between yeti and smallfoot, most of the yetis had moved back to their mountain, choosing to live there until communication became easier – but some of them had found caves nearer the smallfeet's villages to live in. Migo was one of them, along with Meechee, the rest of the SES and a few others. The pros of moving? He was closer to Smallfoot and the rest of the smallfeet. Always new stuff to learn. Fun adventures every day. The cons? \"Meechee!\" Migo yelled. Well – whisper-yelled, he didn't dare raise his voice right then. \"Smallfoot fell asleep on me again! Can you bring me something to drink?\" Smallfoot was, indeed, asleep. It was sprawled out across Migo's chest, a light weight that he barely noticed, its chest rising slightly with every soft snore. Migo hadn't wanted to wake it, and so he'd been sitting in the same position for way too long, his hand resting gently on its back. Meechee poked her head into the room, giggling at the sight of the two of them. \"Aw! You're so cute!\" she gushed. Whether the sweet words were directed at Migo or not he didn't know, and frankly, he didn't care. There was a sleeping smallfoot on his chest and he was thirsty and couldn't move, damnit. \"Yes, thanks,\" he muttered absentmindedly, \"could you? Please? I don't want to disturb it.\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" Meechee said, still giggling when she left the room. Migo looked down at Smallfoot and couldn't help but smile – Meechee was right, all things considered. It was cute, with its soft skin and fiery hair. Scientists Sure They Are Close to Communicating With Yetis! Despite many dead-ends in search of a way to communicate with yetis, scientists recently had a stunning break-through! Communication might be just around the corner! More on page 2. Percy stormed into the cave his yeti had taken up residence in, glancing wildly around before sprinting further in. \"Hey, big guy!\" he called, looking from room to room with a speed he didn't know he could reach. \"C'mon – where are you – \" He was growing impatient, his gloved hands shaking with anticipation rather than the usual chill of the mountains. His yeti appeared – finally – around a corner, looking amused and curious, and Percy rushed over to him. \"You have to come, come on, come on – they've got a prototype ready, they think it's ready to be tested and they want us , come on – \" He tugged at one of his fingers, shifting constantly and almost hopping on the spot with his excitement. His yeti, clearly understanding something big was going on, beamed and hurried after him, only yelling something over his shoulder as he went. The echo of another yeti's answer bounced through the halls, but Percy couldn't care less and only hurried on. A quick run later and Percy tugged his yeti into the building that had been dedicated to the research, hurrying on through the hallways and pushing aside pretty much everyone who stood in his way. \"We're here!\" he called, nodding hurriedly to the press cameras lined up against the walls before pushing through the doors leading to the room he'd been showed earlier. It was a mostly blank room. There was only a small table and two cushions on the floor, one enormous and one regular-sized. On top of the table lay two devices – the prototypes his yeti and he had been asked to test out –, these also of different sizes. Two of the walls were one-way mirrors, camera-men and documenters waiting patiently on the other side of the glass pane. In addition to that he knew there were microphones in the roof. If nothing else, the world would know how this first exchange of words went down. Percy gestured for his yeti to sit down in the enormous cushion before sitting down in the one meant for him. Then, making eye-contact with him, he reached for the smallest device and popped it into his ear. His yeti followed, only somewhat hesitantly. There was a soft crack in his ear. His heart beat harshly in his chest – he'd bonded with this yeti, bonded hard and fast, protected and been protected – what would he be like? How would he sound? What did he have to say to him? What would he say? Sorry for shooting him? Thank you for not harming him? A simple introduction would be a nice start, he berated himself, and with a final nod to himself he cleared his throat. \"H – hello?\" he said, the first word shared between human and yeti. And his yeti's eyes widened, mouth falling open as his hands dropped into his lap. For a moment it seemed like he searched for words, something shocked about his expression though hope soon came into its place. \"It works,\" he whispered. \"I can't believe it works – \"[Chapter 2] Percy laughed, breathless and relieved. His hands, who'd been clutching the hem of his shirt, eased up on their tight hold. \"Wow, I – I'm actually talking to you,\" he said, for a moment forgetting everything about the cameras and the microphones and just breathing , \"I'm – I'm talking to you, and you understand me – \" The awe Percy was experiencing was reflected in his yeti's eyes. \"I – we – have so many questions for you,\" he said, a beaming smile now on his face. Percy didn't say anything for a moment. He could only stare, short of breath and filled with wonder, as he finally, finally could talk to this creature – be understood, and understand in return, seeing just how intelligent they were – and there were so many things he wanted to ask, too – how long have they been here? What's the deal with the guy with the stones? How do they resolve conflict? He wanted to know everything about them – as a community, as a species – And instead of asking any of it, he blurted, \"What's your name?\" Heat rushed to his cheeks right afterwards; here he had the chance of a century, talking face to face with an actual, understanding yeti, and he asked for its name ? It felt like an opportunity lost, somehow, but – But the way his yeti's face lit up made it all worth it. \"I'm Migo!\" he said, prodding his own chest with a beam. \"You?\" \"Percy,\" Percy replied easily. \"Well, Percy Pettersson, but you can call me Percy.\" \"Percy…\" his yeti – Migo ! A name, he had a name ! – repeated thoughtfully. \"I like it.\" Percy blushed again, smiling nervously as he fiddled with his shirt. \"I, uhm. Thank you. Your name is quite nice as well.\" He looked over to the mirrors, where he knew the camera men were gathered, and remembered with a start that Migo thought they were in private. \"This is a, uhm,\" he said, desperately trying to find a way to inform Migo about this without being obvious, \"a big occasion! Yes, a big occasion – for the first time that mankind can remember, communication between human and yeti is possible.\" He raised his eyebrows pointedly, then spoke a bit louder for the next part. \"We are very lucky that this is being caught on tape.\" Migo blinked, then he widened his eyes, gasping softly. \"Are we being monitored?\" he whispered, leaning towards him and glancing left then right suspiciously. Percy nodded slowly. \"Can they hear us?\" Percy nodded again. \"They can't understand you, however, as I am the only human alive with a translator device on my person.\" \"Oh,\" Migo said, sounding a bit relieved as he leaned back on his cushion. \"So… no matter what I say, you're the only one who'll understand?\" Percy nodded once more. \"That's… pretty cool!\" Despite not being directly involved in the development of the translator, Percy still flushed, a sense of pride rushing through him. \"Yes, indeed it is.\" He smiled, a bit flustered, then hurried to pull out the folded paper he'd had in his pocket. \"Now – we have sort of figured out that we're not interested in harming each other, but, uhm, humans want proof of that. So, uhm. We have a list of questions you'll need to answer…\" After a round of exhausting questions that was pretty much just the same question phrased a bit differently every time it was asked, Percy – and what a fitting name – finally put down the information. \"Sorry about that, big guy,\" he said, shrugging apologetically, \"but I'm not in control of those things.\" There was a pause, and then he blinked, widening his eyes before slapping his hands up to cover them. \"I cannot believe I just said that…\" he murmured. \"Said what?\" Migo asked, curious and confused at Percy's reaction. \"I've, uhm.\" Percy threw a glance at the reflective surfaces at each wall, then grimaced slightly. \"The official meeting is over,\" he said, raising his voice, \"please turn off the cameras.\" A few moments later the doors opened and a female smallfoot came in. \"Mister Pettersson,\" she said, not offering Migo a glance, \"we have stopped recording. You may not bring the translators home just yet – in two days' time or so you may, but we still need the information stored within them.\" \"Oh,\" Percy said, \"oh, well, alright then.\" He looked over at Migo, a small frown on his brow. \"Uhm. Could we get some more time to talk?\" \"Apologies, mister Pettersson,\" she said, shaking her head. \"We cannot allow that as of right now.\" Percy squinted at her. A few moments passed where they just looked at each other, Migo sitting uncomfortable and out-of-place in the corner – and then he nodded. \"Alright, then. But we'll be back in two days.\" He looked over at his shoulder again, his gaze quickly finding Migo's. And then he smiled, a small, soft smile that was barely even noticeable if you didn't know what to look for. \"We have a lot of missed talks,\" Percy said, quiet and soft, the words directed at him rather than the woman. Migo smiled, then nodded. \"We sure do,\" he agreed. \"Do we really have to wait two days, though?\" He would've loved to talk more to Percy – ask him what he'd been thinking during their first meeting, apologize for almost letting him die, thank him for saving his life and for giving this peace the opportunity to live. \"Afraid so,\" Percy said. He shrugged, then turned to face him fully. \"Well,\" he said, bringing one hand up to his ear, \"I'll talk to you later – Migo.\" And with that he tugged the translator out of his ear. Migo reached up to do the same to his, placing it back down on the wooden surface he'd picked it up from. Percy put his down beside it, and then he stood, waving for Migo to follow him. \"Two days, huh?\" Migo said, walking out of the building. Percy looked over at him with raised eyebrows and a curious tilt to his head, but he didn't speak. \"I can wait. Not like I have much of a choice,\" he muttered. The defeated tone must've translated across the language barrier, for Percy laughed lightly and patted his leg, chattering away in his bright tones. And, strangely enough, Migo felt a bit better about their situation just from that. They didn't get very far before Brenda stormed after them, calling Percy's name as she went. \"Wait - they want an interview with you, Percy!\" She sounded excited, her hands waving frantically for him to stop. Blinking, Percy gave her a wide-eyed, surprised look. \"With me?\" he asked. \"Now?\" She nodded, breathless and with her hands on her knees as she gasped for air. \"But uh…\" Percy looked over at Migo, who only seemed confused at the commotion. \"I… I guess?\" He turned to Migo with a sigh, offering him a helpless shrug. \"I gotta go, big guy - you get back to your friends, yeah? I'll come back later.\" And despite not understanding his words, Migo apparently understood the intent, for he nodded, then walked away, his steps light only because he wanted them to be. Percy stood very still watching him walk away, distant for a moment as he considered everything that was going on in his life. Then – \"Alright,\" Percy said, clapping his hands together and spinning to give Brenda a smile. \"Let's do this, shall we?\" \"...and now, directly following this first contact, we have Percy Pettersson! And tell us, now, Percy, how is it, talking to a yeti?\" \"It is absolutely sensational,\" Percy said, giving the camera a wide, beaming smile that was far from fake. \"Every single moment I spend in their presence makes me more certain of the fact that they are far from the wild beasts we once thought them to be. Rational thought! Actual speak, with no stutter or hesitation! Nuanced, emotional words! It's simply mind-blowing.\" \"Yes, of course,\" the woman behind the microphone said, nodding hurriedly. \"Tell me - and all of us at home, watching - what did you talk about?\" \"Peace contracts, mostly,\" Percy said, shrugging slightly. He didn't add the ' unfortunately' that rang at the back of his mind. It had been, it truly had been, but he doubted the cameras would appreciate that. She nodded again. \"And, Percy, you were the first to trust the yetis were not out to harm us - are you surprised by anything that was said during this meeting?\" Percy cocked his head in thought. \"Not really,\" he admitted. He hadn't been; Migo hadn't told him anything he wasn't already unconsciously aware of. \"I knew they wanted nothing but peace for our kinds. The only surprising thing was his readiness to part with his name, to be honest.\" \"You exchanged names?\" the woman asked, her eyebrows rising into her hairline. Percy nodded easily. \"And this yeti - the first yeti to ever talk, understand, and be understood by humans - what is it called?\" He looked at the camera, a warm happiness crawling through him as he was, again, reminded of what had just happened. He'd talked to him. Talked to him. \"Migo,\" he breathed, and the name fell from his lips with ease. \"His name is Migo.\"[Chapter 3] The moment he was out of view from the building, Migo began running. Meechee met him halfway down the hill, her eyes bright and joyous. \"So?\" she asked, hopping from foot to foot in excitement. \"How did it go , Migo?\" Migo grabbed her by the elbows and hopped with her, his beam even brighter than hers. \"His name is Percy,\" he exclaimed, breathless after the run, \"his name is Percy and I talked to him and he understood me – \" \"That's great!\" Meechee said, her smile widening. \"That's – really cool, actually – \" \"And his voice is actually kinda nice, when it's not high-pitched and squeaky,\" Migo mused, poking his lower lip thoughtfully. Meechee laughed. \"So is everybody's, though,\" she said, her amusement and happiness bleeding into the words. Then she looked around, a confused frown slowly forming on her brow. \"But – where is smallfoot?\" \"Oh,\" Migo said, stepping away from her with a shrug. \"He had to do something else. I think he'll be back soon? I'm not sure.\" \"Oh.\" Meechee tapped her chin for a brief moment, looking up at the sky as she thought. \"Well, tell me more, then,\" she finally said, again breaking out into a wide grin. \"What did he say? What did you talk about? Spill the details!\" \"Percy,\" Percy said, for the sixth time in half a minute. \" Per-cy . Come on, big guy, you can do it. Peeeercyyyy.\" He gestured towards Migo, who was sitting opposite of him in the main room of the cave-system he and a few other yetis lived in. Migo very pointedly cleared his throat, then said, somewhat hesitant and in a dark growl, \" Poor - sea ?\" \"Yes!\" Percy exclaimed, throwing his hands into the air with a beam. They'd been trying to say each others' names for quite a while now – poorsea was the closest either of them had gotten this far. \"Great, good job, Migo, I knew you could do it.\" He preened a bit at that, before focusing on Percy once more. Then, prodding his own chest pointedly, he let out a low, deep rumble of a growl. Percy blinked. \"Oh,\" he said, \"that's – that's your name, right, of course – \" He cleared his throat, then, very nervously, attempted to procreate the sound Migo had made. Migo stared at him with wide eyes. Then, very slowly, he shook his head. He coughed, then repeated the deep growl, slower this time. \"Wait, that… that sounded kind of like maroon…?\" Percy mumbled to himself. \"Only slower. Deeper? Maroo. Maaroo. Marrooo?\" He cleared his throat, held up a finger, lowered his voice, and attempted a deep, \" Maarroo .\" Migo nodded enthusiastically, repeating his own name. Percy, happy and excited to have managed the sound so quick, said it back to him again. They got caught up in this and repeated it a few times back and forth, getting increasingly more excited about it each time, until the two of them were nearly bouncing around the room while happily shouting Migo's name at the top of their lunges. Then suddenly Migo broke the chain, pointing at Percy and uttering a very clear, \" Poor-sea, \" in what Percy translated to be a ' I might be Migo, but you're Percy ,' tone. Percy nodded very seriously, still moving in a marched circle, \"Oh, I'm Percy, alright,\" he said, again nodding. \"Poor-sea!\" \"Maarroo!\" Percy called back, and soon they were in a back-and-forth loop of poor-sea-maarroo-poor-sea-maarroo , pointing at each other more and more forcefully with each name. They were in the middle of a dance jig when the purple female yeti walked into the room, coming to a full stop when she noticed them. Percy froze mid-move. He hadn't expected her to interrupt – he hurried to sit down, legs crossed and cheeks on fire. Migo said something to her, shrugged, and offered a goofy grin. That made Percy feel a little better, and he offered her a small wave when she shot him a sceptical look. The two of them exchanged a few words, and Percy sat back on his elbows to admire them as they spoke. It was weird, knowing that their language was just as nuanced as his – that their thought process, their brains, everything was just the same as the homo sapiens. Thank lord they were finally done with all of this, all of the research and the worrying – God, but it had been tiring. Day after wretched day with reading, checking and double-checking and triple-checking, chugging coffee like there was no tomorrow, four hours of sleep each night – just the thought of it made the exhaustion finally sink in, and he yawned, moving a gloved hand to cover his mouth. A second later he had two worried yetis hovering by his side. \"Guys, guys!\" he called, attempting to wave them off even as he fought another yawn. \"I'm fine, I'm just – I'm tired, is all.\" Ugh, imagine going home now , trekking through the snow with his eyes falling shut nearly on their own accord… it would be easier just to stay here. …and why not? He knew it was fine; he'd fallen asleep here several times before. Why couldn't he do it again? Migo and the other yeti shared a few more words, and then a few moments later Percy was picked up gently from the ground. A few yeti steps later and he was held against Migo's chest, the other yeti coming over with what, in her hands, seemed to be a tiny blanket. It was draped over Percy's back, and one of Migo's hands joined it soon after, the warmth doubling quickly. \"Oh,\" Percy said. \"I – thank you.\" He ducked his head so the others wouldn't see his smile, small and flustered and terribly genuine. Not wanting to move all too much in case he'd disturb Migo, he used his teeth to tug of his gloves, tucking them into his pockets before burying his hands in his fur. They lay in silence for a few moments, and then Percy, exhausted and sleep-deprived, began to talk. \"I'm kind of scared, you know,\" he began, slowly carding his fingers through Migo's thick fur. \"I don't know what to say to you. What I should say.\" He tipped his head back to look up at him, surprised and happy to find a clueless yet understanding look on his face. \"You don't understand a word, of course,\" he said, smiling softly, \"but I need to sort out my thoughts, and I do that aloud.\" He put his head back down on Migo's chest, sighing with tire and not distress. \"I think I'd like to thank you,\" he muttered, \"for everything you've done for me. And not only me, but my career, too.\" Slowly, and terribly gently, Migo patted Percy's back, tracing small patterns as well as he could with his gigantic fingers. Percy blushed again, pressing his face into Migo's fur so he wouldn't see it. He bit back a goofy grin, took a deep breath, and continued to speak. \"Then again, maybe I should apologize… oh, I don't know. I just… I don't know anything anymore - about myself, about the world - if yetis exist, what other mythical creatures might?\" He huffed a small laugh. \"I'm talking to a yeti,\" he muttered. \"A yeti . And he doesn't even understand what I'm saying.\" He shook his head. \"I'm so confused, Migo. Uh - sorry, Maarroo.\" Migo perked up at that, uttering a quiet \"Poor-sea,\" before falling silent again. Percy laughed softly. \"I think it'll be worth it, big guy.\" He tipped his head again, this time giving Migo a very genuine and very tired smile. \"You're probably worrying about the exact same thing, aren't you?\" Migo, despite having no idea what Percy was talking about, smiled back. \"I doubt it,\" Percy said, grinning before putting his head back down again. \"You're so sure about yourself in everything you do…\" He yawned again, rubbing his eyes before closing them and shifting into a more comfortable position. \"I like that about you, Maarroo.\" A soft growl followed by poor-sea was the last thing Percy heard before he slipped off into sleep. Migo sighed heavily as Percy finally slipped into sleep. \"The poor guy must be exhausted,\" he said. Meechee, who was sitting over by the living room table, muttered an agreement. \"He's been driving himself nuts searching for a way to make this translating device,\" Migo continued, stroking his finger down Percy's back once more. \"I'm glad they finally made it.\" \"Because he's got a pretty voice?\" Meechee asked, stocking her playing cards and giving him a teasing grin. \"Uh - \" Migo stuttered, heat rising to his face. \"Nh - no! No.\" He looked down at Percy, resting peacefully on his chest, and smiled softly. \"That's not it at all…\" Meechee snorted. \"As long as you have fun together,\" she offered, spreading her cards out on the table. \"And judging by how I found you just now, you do.\" Migo pouted. \"Don't mock us,\" he complained jokingly. \"We are very dignified.\" \"Mhm. Sure.\" When Percy woke up, it was to his own voice crackling across a speaker. And though he'd been deep in the clutches of sleep just moments ago, now he was wide awake, sitting up so abruptly that the blanket fell off him and down at the ground. \"What's going on?\" he asked, nervously looking around for the source of the noise. The female yeti was sitting on one side of Migo, the curly purple one on the other side. Brenda sat in the female's hand, a computer on her lap. On it was his own face from the broadcast from – earlier? Yesterday? What time was it, anyway? \"B – Brenda!\" he stuttered, heat rising to his cheeks as he gestured for the laptop. \"Don't – \" Migo made a surprised noise, then picked him up from his chest, placing him on his shoulder instead. \"Oh – uh, thanks for that, Migo. Maarroo.\" A growl, then his name. \"Marroo?\" Brenda repeated, frowning in confusion, just as the purple yeti growled something similar to Percy's name. \"It's his name,\" Percy explained, in time with Migo likely saying the same to the purple yeti. \"Well, his yeti name, anyway.\" \"Oh,\" Brenda said. \"You got him to say it?\" Percy nodded. \"Neat. Well, Percy – look here, they're loving the show!\" She gestured for the screen with a bright smile, turning to him with sparkling eyes. \"It's the third time we're seeing it, now, I haven't been allowed to turn it off – just look.\" She reached for the space button and paused the video. A row of complaining growls came from the yetis, Migo's the loudest of them all. Percy chuckled as Brenda started the video again, patting Migo's cheek affectionately. \"I'm flattered, Migo, really,\" he said, nodding along to his own words. \"But if you think that's good, you should see my documentaries.\" Brenda gave a delighted gasp. \"Percy, that's a great idea! But I'm not allowed to turn this off…\" Waving his hand dismissively, Percy stood up on Migo's shoulder before walking, somewhat shakily, down his arm. \"Here, let me,\" he said, crawling undignifiedly into the female yeti's hand. He reached for the computer and paused the video, opening a new tab in one swift move. The complaints were louder this time. \"Wait, wait, wait!\" Percy rushed, turning to Migo with a raised hand. \"Just hold on a moment, Maarroo, okay?\" Migo stilled, looking uncertain for a moment before nodding. He said something to the others, who also stilled, giving him a confused look. Percy turned back to the computer, finding his webpage with ease. Then he found one of the earliest videos he had saved in the archive – a shot of him, some five years younger, somewhat inexperienced and hunting for snakes in the Amazon. Migo gasped when the video turned on, then started blabbering excitedly, gesturing towards the others. Percy's name was mentioned several times. When he finally calmed down, almost two minutes into the episode, three yetis were glued to the screen, more attentive than any child during their first day at school. Percy laughed fondly, then made his way back onto Migo's shoulder, where he leaned against his head with an affectionate smile. If they wanted to spend the whole day watching his reportages, he wasn't about to complain.[Chapter 4] Percy was arguing with another smallfoot standing behind a desk, pointing fingers and raising his voice with almost every garbled word that left his mouth. Migo was fairly sure that this was about the translator devices. It'd been two days since they'd spoken, after all, and this was the same building. Weren't they allowed to get them yet? Was that what was going on? He fiddled with his fur somewhat nervously. If they couldn't get the devices yet he completely understood that – didn't mean that he had to like it, but it wasn't something he could do something about. Finally, after almost five minutes with back-and-fourth high-pitched bickering, the smallfoot held out the devices. Percy snatched them from him, glared, and began to stomp out of the building, Migo hurrying to follow. Percy grumbled darkly to himself the whole hill up to the cave, arms crossed as he glared at the air in front of him. He didn't hand over the biggest device before they made it back to the cave, but when he did, time seemed to slow around them. Migo fastened his device, Percy mirroring his move. And then they stood there for a bit, staring at each other in muted excitement. Percy was the first to speak. \"Migo?\" he said, and he sounded so vulnerable and small that it almost hurt. A smile crept upon him, wide and relieved, and he replied, \"Percy.\" \"Are you going to hang out there in the hallway forever?\" Meechee called, her voice bouncing off the walls in the cave. Percy startled, turning wide eyes in the direction the sound had come from. \"Oh,\" he said, a soft and astonished noise. \"I – \"Uhm,\" Migo called, \"nooo…?\" Meechee laughed, then showed up in the cave entrance, a wide beam on her face. \"Oh!\" she said. \"The translator devices? You got them?\" Before either of them could reply, she waved eagerly to Percy. \"Hi!\" \"Heh,\" Percy uttered, giving a small wave back. \"Hello.\" \"Aww,\" Meechee cooed, clapping her hands together beneath her chin. \"He's so cute! Right, Migo?\" She directed her beam at him. Percy's gaze flickered between them. \"Sorry,\" he said, tilting his head curiously, \"but are you two, you know… dating?\" Migo blinked. \"What? No – no, no.\" He shook his head, emphasising this gesture by making wild cutting gestures with his hands. \"We're just – we're just friends.\" Meechee gasped. \"Wait, he thinks we're mated?\" she asked, sounding both delighted and shocked that he'd come to that conclusion. \"Uhm,\" Migo said, exchanging a look with Percy. \"Something like that.\" \"Sorry to disappoint you, little guy,\" Meechee said, directing her smile at Percy this time, \"but I've got someone else in sight.\" Sighing theatrically, Migo shook his head mournfully. \"And she refuses to tell us,\" he muttered. \"Boo hoo,\" Meechee said, playfully wiping the fur beneath her eyes. \"Anyway, I'm sure you have lots to talk about, so I'll return to my drawing. Bye!\" And with that she disappeared back into the deeper parts of the cave. They both stared after her for a moment, then Migo shook his head. \"Let's just... ignore that,\" he muttered. \"Come on!\" He walked further into the cave, Percy following him with ease. They made their way to Migo's personal room, where Migo sat down on his bed – a stone – and Percy sat down on his beside table – also a stone. \"Right,\" Percy said, his breath hitched and word hesitant. He rubbed his hands together, looking down at his lap rather than Migo. \"Uhm.\" This was it. The first actual conversation the two of them would hold. And all Migo felt was guilt. \"I'm sorry,\" he blurted, the words rushed and running into each other. Percy blinked, looking up at him with wide eyes. \"What?\" \"I'm sorry,\" Migo repeated, looking away from his piercing eyes. \"I – for – for everything – leaving you – hurting you – \" \"Migo,\" Percy said, stumbling to his feet and stepping over to him, hands on his knee, \"Migo, what are you – when did you hurt me, I don't – \" And it all came pouring out, all the guilt and the shame and the pain, now that he could finally say it to him. \"You couldn't breathe – you couldn't breathe and you fainted and I just let him take you because I believed a lie from a liar even when I knew you'd die and I'm sorry – \" \"Migo – \" Percy repeated, tugging gently at his fur, \"Migo, stop !\" Migo obediently shut his mouth, closing his eyes in shame. \"You're sorry? You regret your actions?\" His eyes snapped open again, staring down at Percy in shock. \"Wha – of course I regret my actions, I almost had you killed – if it hadn't been for Meechee – \" \" Migo . Migo, look at me.\" Migo did so, surprised to find a gentle expression on Percy's face. His next words, spoken softly yet sternly, echoed through the room. \"I forgive you.\" Migo inhaled sharply. \"But – Percy, I – \" \"Sht.\" He held up a finger, raising his eyebrows pointedly. \"I don't want to her it. I forgive you. I don't know the story behind it, but I'm fine, everything worked out, and you regret what you did. Of course I forgive you.\" He ducked his head, rubbing his arm self-consciously. \"The question is if… if you can forgive me.\" Now it was Migo's time to be surprised. \"Forgive you ?\" he asked. \"What have you done?\" \"I wasn't exactly kind to you when we first met,\" Percy muttered. \"Or is that how you yetis greet each other? By hurling skiing rods at each other's faces?\" he asked, his tone most definitely sarcastic. He still didn't look at him, giving the wall a somewhat disgusted look instead. Migo, astonished, blinked in shock. \"Are you – are you serious ? You saved my whole species ,\" he said, gesturing both to himself and towards the mountain he'd once called his home. \"I have – no idea how much you gave up to do it, but you did it , and that's what matters .\" He drew a deep breath and shook his head in disbelief, straightening up again. \"Even though I couldn't see it then, I see it now. I forgive you, too, Percy.\" Percy's hands dropped to his sides. \"Wait – really?\" Migo nodded. The smile he got in return was shaky, but a smile nonetheless, and he counted that as a victory. \"Well – yes, okay, well then – \" Percy cleared his throat. \"I, uhm, what was – what was next?\" he muttered, frowning to himself. He patted himself down, sticking his hands into his pockets, the frown deepening. \"There – the list, there was a list – \" He continued patting himself down, walking in a stressed circle as he emptied his pockets. \"Where is – I know I had – \" A small piece of paper was torn out of one of his pockets when he pulled his hand out, but he was too busy patting himself to see it, so Migo reached for it and plucked it out of the air. He chuckled. \"Is it this one?\" he asked, offering Percy a smug grin when he flushed. \"You're cute when you're flustered, you know that, right?\" He handed the paper back over. Percy turned a brighter shade of red. \"I – I, uhm – \" He cleared his throat, then smiled at him, a nervous but genuine smile. \"Thanks, you're… you're not that bad-looking yourself.\" Migo laughed. \"What's the list for?\" he asked, once his laughter had died down. \"Well,\" Percy said, unfolding the paper and scanning its contents quickly, \"I was, uhm, nervous about talking to you, so I – uhm, I made a list of what I wanted to say.\" Blink. \"You made a list,\" Migo repeated, dumbfounded. \"You made a list ?\" A slow grin came over his expression, a low giggle at the back of his throat. \"You're an adorable dork !\" Percy's cheeks turned dark again. He raised the list to eyelevel, very obviously hiding behind it. Migo laughed again. \"That's cute, too! Don't hide!\" He gently pushed the list down with one finger, winking at Percy when he peered at him, cheeks still fiery red. \"You are insufferable,\" Percy muttered, but he couldn't quite hold back the grin as he looked down at the paper again. \"Aw, come on – this isn't the right one, this is my grocery list.\" He sighed and pocketed it again, shaking his head in disappointment. \"I guess we'll go by heart, then.\" Clearing his throat, he shook his hands and shoulders before clapping said hands together. \"Right, so – I wanted to say thank you, and I wanted to tell you my full age, and I wanted to ask you who you are, and I wanted to – \" Migo chuckled, shaking his head fondly as he tapped Percy's head gently. \"Percy,\" he said, \"how about we just talk? No lists. No walls.\" Percy, who'd been in the middle of a word when Migo cut him off, gaped at him. Then he shut his mouth, smiled a small smile, and nodded. \"No walls,\" he agreed.[Chapter 5] They talked for hours on end, Migo telling Percy all about himself and who he was. About his friends, and about his father, who's job was to… wake up the sun, apparently? An honorable job which was supposed to fall onto Migo's shoulders, but was no longer necessary – nor, as Migo told him, wanted. In return Percy shared childhood memories, telling Migo about his own father who'd never truly supported him even when he burned for something. The conversation then turned to Percy explaining his job – how he'd always been interested in animals, fascinated by the world, intrigued by the wonders of life. He left out the part about being more interested in fame recently. The shame was still fresh in his mind, even then, almost three months after he'd realized his mistakes – how could he have done such a thing? When had fame become more important than what he truly wanted – to be free? When Percy finished telling the story about the monkey who stole his tent that one time, the female yeti – who he still didn't know the name to – popped her head into the room. \"Uh, guys? It's gone dark outside. Is the smallfoot – \" She glanced at Percy. \" – sorry, Percy – is he staying tonight, too?\" Too ? He hadn't slept over that often, had he? \"Uhm,\" Migo said, looking over at Percy with raised eyebrows. Percy shrugged, leaving it up to Migo to decide. It was the same to him – he had no problems with staying, and although walking home through the snow would be a nightmare after dark it's not like he would die. \"Yeah, sure.\" She beamed. \"Okay!\" She walked half-way out of the room, then stumbled back in, a soft frown on her brow. \"Uhm, Kolka is trying to sleep… could you tone it down a little?\" she asked, sounding far more apologetic than she should be. They hadn't been that loud, but nonetheless, both Percy and Migo nodded. And with a grateful 'thanks!' she was gone. A beat, and then Migo looked over at Percy with a raised eyebrow. \"Are you tired?\" Determined not to let his exhaustion show, Percy shook his head. It likely would've been believable, too, if he hadn't had to slap his hand over his mouth to stifle a yawn. Migo snorted. \"Whatever you say, Percy,\" he said, grinning when Percy shot him a glare. \"Look,\" Percy said, mockingly disgruntled, \"it's not my fault that I tire faster than you.\" The grin widened. \"Did I say it was?\" \"I – no, but – \" The grin developed into a giggle. \"C'mon,\" Migo said, standing up from the stone, \"let's get you to bed.\" \"I'm not going to bed unless you are, too!\" Percy stubbornly called after him. \"Shhh,\" Migo said, putting a finger to his lips. Mischief shone in his eyes. \"Meechee told us to be quiet. So be quiet!\" \"Meechee?\" Percy repeated, jumping from one stone to another to keep up with Migo as he moved around the room, poking his head into a closet. \"Is that her name, then?\" \"Hm? Oh – oh, of course!\" Migo offered him a sheepish grin over his shoulder. \"Yeah, that's – that's Meechee. The tiny one is Fleem, the purple and curly one is Gwangi, and the last is Kolka.\" \"Huh,\" Percy said, climbing onto Migo's hand without a second thought when it was offered to him. \"Those are some peculiar names.\" Migo sat down on the stone again, letting Percy crawl onto his chest. \"Maybe to you,\" he said, draping a thick woolen blanket over Percy, \"but not to us. Percy is a weirder name, I think.\" \"Excuse me? Percy is a perfectly normal name , thank you very much.\" One of Migo's eyebrows slowly rose into his hairline. \"Oh, fine ,\" Percy muttered, looking away and crossing his arms. \"It's a normal name to me .\" Migo giggled. The darkness in the room was pressing, harsher and colder than any ice Migo had ever encountered – and still it had nothing on the lump in his throat, or the lump in his chest, or the ever-present guilt-tinted shame. He couldn't sleep. Three months had passed since it had happened, and still it hurt – still it pained him to think about what he'd done, what he'd almost done, and what he'd considered doing. He was in a turmoil, confusing himself and hurting because of that, confused at his pain and pained at his confusion, worried and not understanding and longing for the truth. The truth . He had to know. \"Percy?\" he asked, his voice casting echoes within his own mind. A shift, a gentle tug at his fur, and then Percy's voice came, thick with sleep. \"Yeah?\" \"I – how – what were you thinking?\" Migo stuttered. The words didn't want to come out, stuck in his throat, caught on the hesitant stutter of his heart. \"When you first – when I – we – \" Percy, perhaps noticing his struggle, cut him off, soft and gentle. \"When we first met?\" \"I – yeah.\" Silence crackled through the air, his skin crawling, a sense of worry creeping down his spine. Why was he taking so long to answer? Was it bad? Did he hate him – regret ever talking to him? Finally, after a pause that seemed to stretch on for eons – \"I thought I was going to die.\" Migo inhaled sharply, the hand that was resting upon Percy's back twitching. Die. He'd thought he was going to die . Gosh, how stupid did Migo have to be to not realize that it would be off-setting? The size-difference, the language barrier, the abruptness of it all – he , damnit, of course he'd be off-setting – Had he been picked up by a creature six times his size he would've been terrified too, for wowness' sake! \"Percy…\" he whispered, voice and heart cracking. \"Wait. I'm not done,\" Percy interrupted softly. He took a deep breath, then continued, \"I was terrified . Thought you were going to eat me, actually.\" The words sent sharp shards of cold fire through him, throbbing pain that welled and curled through him. Of course he'd thought that. Of course . What a stupid idiot he'd been – \"But then you saved me from a bear.\" – wait, what? Percy chuckled softly, slowly carding his fingers through Migo's fur. \"And then you fainted at the sight of a teeny tiny bit of blood, and I realized that…\" He chuckled again, warmer this time. More welcoming. \"Well, that you're just a dork, really.\" Migo gaped at him. \"I – wh – \" \"It was the moment that changed everything,\" Percy whispered, peering up at him through his bangs. And through the darkness – of the room, of Migo's thoughts, of his guilt and shame – his eyes gleamed with honesty something utterly, terribly kind. Closing his eyes, Migo drew a sharp breath, bringing Percy up to his shoulder to hug him as well as he was able to. He didn't say anything, only held on as tightly as he dared – and Percy, bless his soul, didn't comment on it at all. The view from Migo's shoulder was truly something to behold. Percy'd seen a lot through his life – he'd travelled across the world for several years, discovering and exploring and documenting as he went. And still there were moments where he was in complete awe of the world and its beauty, at the way it tugged and tore at his heartstrings. Moments like these, when there was nothing but snow and forest and mountains stretching before and beneath him, warmth underneath his palms and Migo's steady hand holding him up. His heart swelled in his chest, familiar and safe – \"God, how I've missed this,\" he breathed, a wide and breathless smile on his face as he turned to take in the full scenery. Migo tilted his head. \"Missed what?\" he asked. Normally Percy would be irritated if someone interrupted a moment like that, but – somehow it made it better , having Migo there – his warmth, his smile, the steadiness and safety. \"The beauty of the world,\" Percy replied, looking down at Migo with a widening smile. It was noon when they finally made their way into the village. That was partially Percy's fault – he had Migo stop by every little thing so he could take a picture, or so he could explain what it was, or just so he could take a moment and breathe, basking in the glory of being alive. The plan was for Percy to stop by the shop to get some groceries for later, but before the two of them could get that far, a disgruntled Brenda ran up to Migo's side, glaring up at Percy. \" There you are,\" she said, crossing her arms over her chest. She sighed, giving him a mostly irritated and somewhat amused expression. \"Did you sleep with the yetis again?\" Percy blushed. \"Why do people keep saying again ? I don't do it that often!\" Migo coughed into his hand, looking away with a barely-concealed smile. Percy blushed harder, tapping his cheek lightly – a mockery of an offended slap. \"Hush, Migo!\" Brenda shook her head in exasperation. \"Should I just cancel your hotel room?\" Percy gaped, then flushed tomato red when Migo howled with laughter. Brenda raised her eyebrows at them. \"Yeah, I'm just going to cancel your hotel room.\" She walked away before Percy had the time to do anything about it. \"Gosh, how embarrassing,\" he muttered, covering his face in his hands. \"Do I really sleep over that often?\" he asked, shooting a somewhat desperate look in Migo's direction. Migo merely raised an eyebrow at him. Percy groaned. The images that flickered across the screen in all their colorful beauty would never cease to amaze Migo. Something told him that the person featured most of the time wouldn't cease to amaze him, either. Migo paused Percy's show, looking up from the screen to the actual Percy. He was sitting on the round stone table in the living room of the caves, a computer in his lap, his fingers flying across the keyboard. He appeared focused, eyebrows knitted together and lips pursed in concentration – but when he noticed Migo's gaze, the frown eased and the frantic typing stopped. He raised his eyebrows in a silent question, tilting his head slightly. \"I had no idea there was so much out there,\" Migo whispered. The awe in his voice was so clear that he could hear it himself. \"The world is – so much bigger than what I – what any of us could've imagined it to be – \" He drew a deep breath, shaking his head in astonishment. \"And so many species , so many places I'll never be able to see…\" When he was ten he thought he'd seen the whole world because he'd stepped outside of the village. Gosh , how wrong he'd been. \"One day I'll take you there,\" Percy said, fondness bleeding into the words. \"All of the places I've been to. I'd be happy to show them to you.\" \"I – wait, really?\" Migo gaped at him, a slow smile creeping onto his expressions. \"No, seriously ? Are you – really? \" Percy shrugged. \"Travelling has been my career since I was nineteen ,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"Of course I'd like to show you the world.\" Migo, incredibly flustered and very unsure about how to react to that, blushed and turned back to his screen. Whether Percy heard his mumbled thank you or not he didn't know – but the soft smile he got in return suggested he might've.[Chapter 6] \"What if they get mad?\" \"Huh? Mad? Why would they be mad?\" \"Because we – well, because we took… you know .\" \"Oh! Oh, nah, they won't be mad because of that, trust me.\" \"But what if ?\" \"Then you can blame it all on me and let me do all the talking.\" Meechee winced, not entirely convinced about that approach. \"Well, if you say so…\" she nonetheless muttered. Brenda offered her a kind smile. \"Look, Percy is a nice guy, he's not about to chew you out because of this .\" She gestured towards her ear, where the translator device was nestled. \"And it's about time I get to talk to you anyway, it's been months .\" \"Yeah, I – I guess it has!\" Meechee smiled, nervously poking her index fingers together. \"I, uhm. Have been wanting to talk to you, too, actually.\" \"Oh?\" Brenda cocked her head curiously. \"About what?\" \" – everything ,\" Meechee blurted, \"about your world, about you , about all the knowledge you have, and – \" She stopped herself, taking a deep breath and gesturing for herself to calm down. \"Right, sorry. You wanted to talk to me?\" She shook her head fondly. \"I'll answer all your questions in a few,\" she promised. \"But before that…\" Drawing a small breath she stapled her fingers together beneath her chin, tilting her head down to give Meechee a serious look. \"Percy is very obviously crushing on Migo.\" Meechee exhaled heavily, pressing a hand against her chest. \"Oh, thank stone! \" she exclaimed. Brenda blinked, a confused expression taking the serious one's place. Meechee hurried to elaborate. \"If Migo hasn't already fallen he'll do it any moment now – I'm just glad it's not one sided, is all.\" Brenda gasped in delight. \"No!\" she exclaimed, a wide smile unfurling on her face. \"Are you serious?\" Meechee nodded eagerly. \"Well, that makes everything way easier!\" Then she frowned, tapping her lower lip thoughtfully. \"It doesn't solve the full problem, however.\" Meechee very determinedly did not stare. \"I don't know about Percy, but Migo is an oblivious moron,\" she added. While it wouldn't be helpful to find a solution, it was valuable information. \"An oblivious Maarroo?\" Brenda asked with a playful grin. Then she giggled, shaking her head at her own antics. \"Sorry, I had to – Percy hasn't been talking about anything but Migo the last few days, I'm getting tired of it all.\" Nodding mournfully, Meechee patted Brenda's head gently. \"I feel your pain,\" she said. \"Migo has been going on and on and on about Percy's voice.\" Brenda's grin turned into a genuine smile as she brushed her hand across Meechee's finger. \"A struggle, isn't it?\" she asked, snorting when Meechee nodded mournfully again. \"Well, we can't have you running around being in pain, and they'll never realize they're interested in each other unless we do something.\" She shrugged. \"So, I guess we'll have to do something.\" Meechee gasped, not moving her hand from where it lay in front of Brenda. \"Wait, you mean we're going to set them up ?\" \"Migo gave Percy a rock yesterday and Percy treats it as though it's a precious gem that will shatter if he handles it roughly,\" Brenda said flatly. \"It's not gonna be hard, Meech.\" \"Aw,\" Meechee cooed, pretending that the goofy smile that came over her was because of Migo's gift and not Brenda using her nickname. \"That's adorable!\" Brenda slowly raised an eyebrow. \"And, uh, yes – of course, yes, you're absolutely right, Brenda, adorable and very, very bad, they need to exchange love confessions, not rocks. Yes. Of course.\" Brenda stared at her for a moment, then snorted, covering her mouth with her hand. Her shoulders shook with muffled laughter, joy in her eyes. \" Anyway ,\" Meechee pointedly said, heat rising in her cheeks. \"How do we go about setting them up? They're fools in love, they'll deny every sign of the others' interest.\" Clearing her throat, Brenda clapped her hands together. \"Right, uhm – I do have a few thoughts about that, actually.\" Meechee leaned forward, gesturing for her to continue. And so the plotting began.[Chapter 7] Percy was looking through the clips from his newest vlog-idea, trying to decide which videos to use and which to discard when Migo popped his head into the room. \"Hey, uhm… Percy?\" \"Don't just hover in the door,\" Percy said, not looking up from his computer as he spoke. \"It's your room, come on in.\" Migo shuffled into the room, shifting his weight from foot to foot. Percy glanced up at him, a tinge of worry fluttering in his guts. It wasn't like Migo to hesitate. Had something happened? \"Is something wrong?\" he asked, gently closing the computer and putting it aside. \"Uh – I – no, I just – \" He poked his index fingers together. \"Aaahthere'sayetifestivalcomingupinafew daysandIwaswonderingifyouwantedtogotoitwithme?\" Percy blinked. \"Come again?\" Sighing, Migo looked down at the floor, his shoulders slumping. \"There's… there's a yeti festival soon, celebrating the – uh, I don't know the word, the Sky Banners? Anyway, I, uhm… I'm going to it, do you want to join me?\" Percy stared at him, heart stuttering in his chest. \"I – you really want me to?\" Time seemed to slow around them. Migo wanted him to partake in his culture – go to a yeti festival with him, simply because he could . It was – oddly touching, and a terribly sweet gesture. Migo nodded. \"Migo,\" Percy breathed, climbing to his feet in a hurry. He stepped over to the edge of the table, and Migo, understanding his silent question, let him climb into his hand. \"I'd love to go,\" Percy continued, smiling softly up at him. \"When is it? What's it about?\" For a brief moment awe shone in Migo's eyes, unclouded and clear, but then he blinked and it was gone, replaced by a relieved smile. \"It's – well, it's a festival to celebrate the beauty of – uhm…\" He hesitating, glancing away from him with downcast eyes. \"I… don't know what it's called. Lights on the night sky?\" \"Stars?\" Percy suggested curiously. \"No, not stars, I know those – it's like, ribbons? Of colors?\" Percy gasped. \" Northern lights ?\" he asked. \"Aurora borealis? You have an aurora borealis festival?\" Migo nodded eagerly. \"Yeah, we do! Every year, at the same date, the Sky Banners dance across the sky, and all yetis gather together to celebrate them. There's food, and ice, and drinks, and some games and stuff – merchants lower their prices on things, too.\" Now, Percy'd seen Northern Lights before, when he'd been to Svalbard to document the life there – but he'd never seen them with a yeti before. He'd never seen them with Migo . And besides, this was more than just seeing the Northern Lights – this was celebrating something from Migo's culture. He couldn't quite describe it, but – somehow it seemed like it was extremely important. And he truly, honestly appreciated it. \"It sounds lovely,\" he said, patting Migo's thumb affectionately. \"When is it?\" \"This Saturday.\" \"It's a date,\" Percy said. It was what he and Brenda always said to each other when they made plans – it was an instinctual reaction, really. Still, he tensed and flushed bright red when he realized what he'd said. \"I – I mean – \" Migo blinked at him, then gave a teasing grin. \"A date, huh?\" \"I – \" \"Nope! No turning back now,\" Migo said, the grin widening as he tapped Percy's forehead. \"It's a date.\" And Percy, terribly flustered and red as a tomato, found that he didn't really want to complain. \"Meechee?\" Meechee dropped her chalk, jumped three feet into the air, and spun to face him with a too-wide smile. \"Hi Migo! Nope I haven't done anything!\" She clasped her hands behind her back, the smile widening further. Migo blinked. \"Uhm. Okay?\" He shook his head, pushing her odd behaviour aside for now. \"The Banner Fest was this weekend, right?\" He was fairly certain he had the right dates, but he'd been known to mess them up before. It was better to be safe than sorry. \"Oh!\" Meechee wiped her hands on her fur, a relieved tone to her voice. \"Yes, it is.\" Then she gasped, flapping her hands excitedly at him. \"Wait, no, you should bring Percy! That'd be great!\" Migo grinned sheepishly. \"I, uhm, already asked him.\" Meechee blinked. \"You did?\" \"Yeah. He's coming.\" \"Oh.\" She stared at him for a moment before she shook her head. \"Yes, well, then – \" \"Who are you taking?\" Migo blurted, knowing that Meechee, daughter of the Stonekeeper, would feel obligated to take someone. She rubbed her arm. \"I – I'm taking Kolka. Again.\" Migo squinted. \"But she isn't who you want to take, is she?\" he asked. If she'd been crushing on Kolka they'd all know – the two of them had never been able to keep secrets about each other. Meechee blushed. \"No,\" she admitted with a grin, \"she's not, and she knows it.\" \"I wish you'd just tell us ,\" Migo exclaimed, flinging his hands into the air. Meechee snickered. \"Come on , Meechee, we can help you get together!\" \"Hmm…\" Meechee tapped her lip thoughtfully. \"Nah.\" Migo groaned in frustration. \"I will give you a geode if you tell me!\" \"Just one?\" \" Meechee! \" Saturday came both far too soon and not nearly fast enough, by Percy's standards. Brenda had very pointedly thrown him his bags after she'd cancelled his hotel room, and he'd thoughtlessly flung them into a corner of Migo's room. Now he stood pacing before them, trying to decide between comfortable clothes and clothes he knew complimented his hair. \"Oh, come on, Percy,\" he muttered to himself, dropping the two jackets he'd been weighing against each other. \"It's not even a real date, why are you so nervous?\" He sighed, rubbing his forehead. \"It's on a mountain . You almost died the last time you were up there, it's cold, go for warmth , not good looks.\" Biting his lip he considered the two jackets again, groaning in frustration. \"Oh, but I want to impress him !\" He slapped his cheeks a few times as he thought. \"No, damn it all, I don't want to die up there.\" He snatched the comfy, baby blue jacket from his bag and stood up. \"Right. Right.\" Stuffing the two thermoses of hot chocolate into his backpack he flung it onto his back, making his way out of the room and towards the main room of the cave. The other yetis were waiting for him there. They'd all paired up, it seemed – Meechee and Kolka sat side by side on one of the stones, and Fleem had somehow managed to crawl onto Gwangi's shoulders. \"Ready to go?\" Migo asked. He'd twined a few flower stems around his broken horn, their sharp green color stunning against his blue. \"I sure am,\" Percy said, looping his thumbs behind the straps on the backpack and offering a cheeky grin. The other yetis turned to Migo with raised eyebrows. Migo sighed. \"He said he's ready to go,\" he said, rolling his eyes. \"Gosh. Those devices better be ready soon, I'm getting tired of translating.\" \"You and me both, Maarroo.\" Percy blinked, realizing his mistake only after it'd slipped out of him. \"Uhm. Sorry.\" \"Cute,\" Migo said, a flippant remark that made Percy go bright red once more. Migo laughed, then offered his hand, letting Percy climb onto his palm. \"Let's go, guys. We don't want to be late.\" Muttered agreements came from the other yetis. Well, most of them. \"I don't really care,\" Fleem said from his position on Gwangi's shoulders. \"Yes, you do,\" Gwangi said flatly. \"Or you wouldn't have asked to go with me.\" Fleem shrugged. \"Maybe I just wanted to spend time with you, hm, how about that?\" Kolka snorted. It was the first time in several months that Migo would return to the mountain. He'd been busy down by the village – greeting smallfeet and sharing stories with Percy, getting to know both him and Brenda, getting settled, signing peace contracts. He was excited to be back – he'd never been away from something this long before. His dad was the first who met them, giving him a warm hug before greeting Percy by name. \"You can talk to them now, can't you?\" he asked. Migo nodded. Percy waved. \"Oh!\" Migo said. \"Yeah, uhm, he can understand you, too.\" After that comment he had to make a hasty escape. The villagers in near proximity flocked to them, questions and wonders falling out of their mouths at a neck-breaking speed. If he hadn't used Meechee as a distraction both he and poor Percy would've been trampled by the crowd. \"Phew,\" Migo breathed, peeking around the rock he'd hid behind, \"that was a close one.\" \"You can tell them they can come down from the mountain if they want answers,\" Percy said drily. \"Hm. Or maybe we could print – but no, you can't read, you'll have to be taught – and damn it, we don't speak the same language.\" He sighed in exasperation. \"Let's just forget it happened.\" Migo laughed, stepping aside from the rock and making for the marketplace. They still attracted some gazes, but Migo had expected that. As long as no one mentioned that they understood each other they would be fine. \"Do you celebrate this every year?\" Percy asked, holding onto Migo's horn as he peeked down at the children running around between the stalls. \"Yep,\" Migo said, nodding at the owner of the stall that'd always sold his favorite flutes. \"We've celebrated this for as long as we've been here.\" \"How intriguing…\" Percy murmured, twisting to look behind them at the growing crowd. \"Are they all here to watch the lights?\" \"Some of them are here for the knocked down prices,\" Migo said. He shrugged, then had to scramble to steady Percy before he could fall to the ground. \"But – oops, sorry – most are here for when the banners appear.\" \"The sun hasn't even set yet,\" Percy muttered. \"Incredible.\" Migo looked away, a flustered smile spreading on his lips. How sweet of him, wanting to know more about their celebration. He'd have to return the favor, somehow… \"What do you pay with?\" Percy asked, peering curiously at the nearest stall. \"You don't have coins, after all…\" \"Oh, that's easy,\" Migo said. \"We work with favors.\" \"Really?\" Percy asked, sounding genuinely surprised. \"So it's a trade, then. You keep amazing me, Migo.\" Migo flushed, proud despite the fact that he certainly hadn't been the one to invent the system. \"Thanks,\" he muttered lamely. Then he perked up, remembering why he came up here in the first place. \"I know of a neat spot,\" he said, patting Percy's leg as he parted from the crowd, \"I found it when I was a child, it's got some great views – but we'll have to hurry to get there.\" Percy fished his scarf out of his backpack, wrapping it around his shoulders before letting Migo put the backpack down on the snow beside them. \"Do we have to wait for a long time?\" he asked, rubbing his hands together before burying them in Migo's fur. They were sitting atop a stone jutting out of the mountain – Migo had gotten there by crawling sideways across the mountainside, and although Percy had been determinedly staring at the insides of his eyelids the whole time, he could safely say that it was worth it. The view was simply extraordinary – the sky stretched out before them, vast and endless, the mountains and forests of the Himalayas beneath them tiny pricks in the distance. He couldn't see the village unless he turned towards it, and the sounds from excited yetis were muted and muffled by both distance, stone, and snow. Migo squinted into the distance, shielding his eyes from the glare of the sunset even as he stared directly into it. \"Nah,\" he said, waving dismissively with his hand. \"A few more minutes, max.\" Percy hummed, kicking his legs up so he could sit sideways on Migo's shoulder, leaning against the side of his head. \"I can wait,\" he said, threading his fingers through the soft and familiar fur. \"It's not like you have a choice.\" \"Git.\" They sat in silence for a while, Percy slowly combing through Migo's long fur. It was calming – he'd practiced meditating when he was in India, and this had many of the same elements. He hummed to himself as he sat there, braiding the strands together after he separated them. And slowly, ever so slowly, the sky darkened. Percy tilted his head, glancing up at it with a raised eyebrow. \"So, does it take a long time before the lights appear - \" He trailed off in favor of gaping up at the sky. \" Oh ,\" he breathed, slowly standing up on Migo's shoulder to take it all in. Ribbons of light stretched before them, across the endless sky and into the distance, far and further still, dancing and whipping in the wind. Through them the stars were clearly visible – and here, far away from any human made light they shone even brighter in their splendour. \"I – they – it's – \" he stuttered, struggling to find words through the awe creeping up on him. Finally he settled on a lame, \"It's beautiful,\" tipping his head back so far that he nearly fell over. Migo chuckled. \"Yeah,\" he said, and his voice was barely a whisper, soft and gentle in the crisp, cold air. \"It is.\" Percy looked over at him, expecting him to be glancing at the sky like himself. Instead he was met with a pair of beautiful blue-purple eyes and a soft smile, genuine and almost painful in its honesty. Percy stared. The lights shone in Migo's eyes, reflected and bouncing in the already colorful gaze. And somehow it seemed, just then, that the beauty of the sky came from within Migo, spots and specks of hope and bravery being flung upon the sky. Oh, nevermind the goddamned sky. Migo was beautiful. Percy drew a deep breath, looking away from him with his heart drumming harshly in his chest. He pressed a hand to it unconsciously, hoping against all hope that the flush in his cheeks could be excused as cold-induced. \"Percy,\" Migo whispered, \"look at me. Please?\" He couldn't have denied him even if he'd wanted to, and so he turned to face him again – and he looked so incredibly vulnerable, so open and raw and loving – He wanted to kiss him, damn it all. For a second they just stared at each other, bathed in the lights of the living sky, and then Migo shifted. \"I'd like to try and say your name again,\" he muttered, and the soft moment shattered like glass. \"I know I'm saying it wrong. Will you help me?\" \"…of course,\" Percy whispered, both disappointed and relieved that neither of them had done anything. He brought a hand to his ear, removing the translator device and waiting patiently for Migo to do the same. He cleared his throat, then said, very slowly and carefully, \" Per – cy .\" Migo took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and – \" Purrcy.\" Percy froze, eyes going wide. That was. Extremely close and that was great, that was awesome, but holy shit there had most definitely been a purr there. \"Oh my God,\" he whispered. Migo cracked open an eye, giving him a curious look. Percy gestured for him to repeat it. He did. The purr rumbled in the air. He could feel its tremble in Migo's shoulder. And it was the most attractive purr he'd ever heard. He drew a sharp breath, leaning forward to rest against Migo's cheek, fingers grasping his fur and forehead nestled just beneath his horn. It was the only thing he dared to do, and Migo seemed to appreciate the contact, leaning back and cradling him with one of his hands. They sat in silence for a long time afterwards, Percy's heart beating slow and sluggish in his chest, each beat echoing with a bittersweet pain. In the village by the Stonekeeper's manor stood a figure, framed by the moon and the stars and the lights of their ancestors. Meechee knew what he was staring at, and she knew she had to intervene. \"Dad?\" she asked, stepping up to her father's side. He startled, tearing his gaze away from the two figures dark against the colorful night sky. \" – Meechee,\" he said. \"You know him better than I – what is…?\" He gestured with his staff towards the shapes on the rock. Meechee leaned against the railings, giving her dad a soft smile. \"Well, dad, when two yetis love each other very much…\" He grimaced. \"Thank you, Meechee, that is quite enough.\" He sighed, turning back to gaze up towards the two of them. \"I just don't understand. The dangers, the differences… how do they see past them?\" \"They don't,\" Meechee said, making her voice as gentle as she could. Her dad had never been very open with things like these – spoon-fed information was generally the best. \"They stare at it, learn it by heart – and accept it.\" She walked over to him, placing a hand on his arm and leaning around his shoulder to give him a soft look. \"Not everything that's different is bad, daddy.\" \"No,\" he muttered, still staring at Migo and Percy with a frown on his brow. \"So I can see.\"[Chapter 8] The snow was falling, darkness creeping. In the distance was a roar, constant and dark, a low rumble through the air. He was running, snow in his boots and fear in his heart. Not being chased, but chasing . The trees surrounding him seemed more like prison bars than wood, tall and dark and looming. He didn't care for them, only evading one when it stood in his path – Then, through the darkness a shape took form, as tall as the trees and enormous to boot, as bright as the snow and the very sun itself. Migo. And suddenly they weren't in the forest anymore, instead standing in a long dark hallway, and on Migo's chest was a target, and in Percy's hand was an actual gun and he aimed, the metal cool against his palm, the shot rang through the air, the bullet zooming off – Percy sat up with a start, staring with wide eyes into the darkness. In his mind was the image of Migo, falling, silent, his beautiful pale fur splattered red – he heaved after air, horror beating within his heart as he realized – Migo shifted beneath him . \"Purrcy?\" he asked, voice thick with sleep and confusion. It all came crashing down, and Percy began to cry. Not soft, quiet crying, but full on sobbing, barely-holding-it-together wailing. Migo sat up, then, hands gentle to keep Percy from falling off of him. \" Purrcy ,\" he repeated, worried now – why was he worried, how could he be worried – he fucking shot him, he was scared and frightened and worried and Percy just up and shot him – yetis had set one foot in this world and immediately been targeted, how could he worry about him ? Something was pushed at him and he blinked, recognizing through his tears the pale blue of the translator device. \"Nh – no,\" he stuttered, batting it away, \"I don't – I can't – \" A low rumble from Migo. Percy glanced up at him, noticing first the concern and confusion brimming in his eyes and then the same pale blue nestled into his fur. He sobbed, a throb of pain bursting within him. Despite it all Migo still worried, still wanted to know, to comfort – He couldn't let him do that – he frantically shook his head. \"I – I don't want to – understand –\" Migo growled softly, using one finger to gently lift Percy's head. Exhaling shakily Percy grabbed onto that finger, screwing his eyes shut. \"It's just – a dream – a nightmare – God, I'm such a damned mess ,\" he whispered. \"A fucking – I suck! I just straight out suck, I – \" He gave a helpless little laugh. \"Why are you even friends with me, I'm a human –\" A complaining sound from Migo, but Percy only shook his head. He needed to say this now , while he still dared to – \"We've given you nothing but hell for ages – I'm one of them , Migo, I shot you, for God's sake!\" He sighed, resting his forehead against Migo's hand. \"We're monsters,\" he whispered. \"I'm horrible…\" Migo turned his hand to cup his cheek, growled, and without a moments hesitation – kissed him. He pulled back immediately after, the contact a bare minimum, but – Percy stared, tears and nightmare forgotten, shock taking their place. \" – Migo,\" he whispered, slowly climbing to his feet. Using his free hand Migo pushed the translator device towards him, eyebrows raised slightly. Percy took it, hands shaking as he popped it into his ear. \"I love you,\" Migo said, speaking in soft tones that rang throughout the air – the loudest words Percy'd ever heard, despite their quiet. \"You are not a monster. Humans are not terrible – everyone fears the unknown. Please, Percy… don't say stuff like that.\" \"Migo,\" Percy breathed. \"I – you – \" \"Love you, yes.\" Percy placed a hand on his cheek to steady himself, then leaned forward and pressed a chaste kiss to Migo's lips. He stood there for a moment, then pulled back, breathing steadily through his nose to keep from crying again – this time from relief. \"I… I love you, too,\" he whispered, carding his fingers into Migo's fur. \"Are you – are you sure…? You don't… you're not angry?\" Migo shook his head, gently gathering Percy in his arms. \"Of course not,\" he murmured. \"Are you?\" Percy nuzzled his arm, his thick fur soft to the sensitive skin of his cheeks. \"No,\" he whispered. \"I love you.\" He was tingling, shock and happiness rushing through him. \"God – \" \"I love you, too,\" Migo whispered, his goofy smile audible in the words. Percy snorted, peering up at him with a wide grin. \"You're such a dork.\" Migo shrugged. \"I'm a cute dork.\" \"The cutest,\" Percy agreed. \"Very beautiful. Most pretty.\" Migo giggled, patting his head affectionately as he shifted into a presumably more comfortable position. \"You feeling better?\" he asked, after a few seconds of content silence. Percy hummed, burrowing deeper into the fur of Migo's shoulders. \"Yeah,\" he whispered. \"Thank you.\" \"Thank you ,\" Migo whispered, pressing a kiss to the top of Percy's head. There were no more nightmares that night.[Chapter 9] Migo had forgotten to mention that there was a second part to the yeti festival. Nonetheless, Percy was happy to join him up in the mountain three days later. He didn't have anything better to do – though it was hard to find something better than spending time with Migo – and the other yetis seemed very insistent that he should join. He'd been told to wear the warmest clothes he had, and now, stepping under carved arches made of pure ice, he saw why. \"What is this place?\" he asked, gazing around with wide eyes. To him this place seemed enormous – it was big even by yeti standards, he could tell. Tall roofs, wide rooms, detailed engravings in the walls… even the air seemed large, heavy around them. It reminded him almost of the aura of a church. Migo shushed him frantically. \" Whisper ,\" he said, \"we're not loud in here.\" Wincing, Percy patted his horn apologetically. This seemed like a serious place; he didn't want to offend anyone by accident. \"Apologies.\" \"No worries,\" Migo muttered. \"Well – the sky lights – northern lights?\" He threw Percy a questioning glance; Percy nodded. \"Northern lights – they're said to be the spirits of our dead. The Banner Fest is them checking up on us to see if we're all good, and in return we go here when they're all gone.\" Northern lights as spirits of the deceased? That was a painful, pretty thought that he absolutely could get behind. \"But where is here?\" Percy asked, intrigued more than ever now that they'd gone further into the ice caves. The natural light of the sun was long gone, replaced by pale blue snails emitting a soft, faded glow. A few yetis were walking through the halls, either in silence or muttering quietly among themselves. Some were carrying flowers, others food or hand-made tools. In the distance one could catch the faintest of songs; a mellow and melancholy song, the words unintelligible. \"Look,\" Migo whispered, nodding his head as they walked through the third archway and into – Percy gasped softly. Along the walls were carved beds, each and every one of them with a different design and set of engravings in the ice. Upon each carved bed lay a yeti, covered by a thin film of perfectly transparent ice. On some of the beds were offerings – food, candles, tools and even flowers. \"Oh,\" Percy breathed. Graves , almost like the catacombs in Rome – no wonder it'd felt like walking into a church. \"Oh, I… I see…\" \"These are all old,\" Migo explained quietly as they kept walking deeper into the caves. \"From the first years we spent up here, I guess.\" Shaking his head in disbelief, Percy turned on Migo's shoulder to take in the grave of a young girl. A single flower lay beside her, her face twisted in a worried frown. \"And they're still remembered?\" Percy whispered, awe slipping into his voice. Migo shook his head, then pointed to one of the graves they passed. \"Their stories are written in the ice,\" he said. \"Who they were. Why they died. What they liked.\" He shrugged. \"Helps us find offerings. No one remembers them, but we won't let them be forgotten.\" \"Wow,\" Percy muttered. \"I'm… I'm honored I get to see this…\" He truly was; to be taken into such a sacred place as this? To be showed and included in a ceremony such as this – it was almost too much for him. There were so few of them – so little, compared to humanity – \"You're one of us, now,\" Migo said, nudging him playfully with his horn. Percy chuckled fondly, batting him away before cuddling against his cheek. \"Thank you for showing me,\" he muttered. \"I'm glad I'm able to be here.\" Migo hummed, a warm and happy sound. \"Me too,\" he whispered, leaning into Percy's touch. They passed beneath another arch; there were more yetis here, some of them kneeling before the graves. \"We're moving into more recent times,\" Migo said. \"The oldest of us might've known some of them personally.\" \"Like the Stonekeeper?\" Migo shook his head. \"The Stonekeepers have their own place. They're our leaders – I guess our ancestors thought it was a good idea to keep the spirits' bodies separate from each other.\" \"Oh.\" They walked in silence for a moment or so, and then Migo sighed heavily, coming to a stop before one of the graves. \"Here we are,\" he muttered, slowly sitting down before the bed. It was empty. \" – Migo?\" He gestured for the empty bed. \"Some yetis disappear,\" he said. \"Now we know what happened to them, of course, but… it was always just assumed they fell into the nothingness.\" Percy's skin crawled. \"And… who is…?\" \"Ma,\" Migo whispered. \"She disappeared when I was young. Went below the clouds, I guess.\" A rush of love and sorrow welled through him. His brave, honorable yeti had gone through all of this mess and was still the great person he was today. That was more than could be said about Percy – even though he'd changed for the better, he'd still been there. \"I'm… I'm sorry,\" he whispered, placing one hand on Migo's cheek. He knew how it was to lose a parent. Migo smiled at him, a soft, sad smile. \"It's no big deal,\" he said, turning back to the empty bed of ice. He reached over to where his mother should have lay, then carefully placed an icicle down before putting a deep purple flower beside it. \"She's long gone.\" He leaned back a bit, then pointed to the engravings running along the upper side of the bed. \"See there?\" he asked, tapping a detailed flower gently. \"That says what her favorite flower was. And this,\" – he tapped the sharp rectangle beside it – \"says she thought icicles were beautiful in the sunrise.\" He lowered his hand and smiled again – not at Percy this time, but at old memories and forgotten joy. \"She was adventurous. Or so I've heard.\" \"I'm sure she'd be extremely proud of you,\" Percy assured him quietly, leaning over to carefully kiss. \"If she was adventurous, she was just like you.\" Migo brought his hand up to touch his back, a gesture they'd mutually and silently agreed was affectionate. \"Life goes on,\" he said. \"The saddest thing is probably that she's never seen the real me – da says she knows who I am, and I hope he's right. Ma always called me her pretty little girl, but…\" He shrugged, even as Percy's blood ran ice cold. \"I guess I'll never know.\" \"Wait,\" Percy said, twisting on his shoulder to give him a part serious and part shocked look. \"Wait, Migo, what are you saying?\" \"…that ma's only ever seen me as a girl?\" Migo asked, a confused frown on his brow. \"Migo – Migo, were you not born in a male body?\" Slowly, confusedly, Migo shook his head. Percy stared at him. \"God, I love you so much,\" he whispered, pressing his forehead against his. \"I – neither was I .\" He let out a small, nervous little laugh. \"Are you – are you serious? You're sitting here at your mother's grave telling me you're trans – \" Leaning his weight on his hands he stretched over to kiss him briefly, happy to see the gleeful yet still confused look on his face. \"Trans?\" he repeated. \"Is that the word for it?\" Percy nodded, still airy and weightless from the shocking discovery. \"Yes, then, I am very much trans. And,\" he said, again touching his back even as he nuzzled him gently, \"I love you, too.\" Exhaling sharply, his breath rattling in his chest, Percy leaned against Migo's head, carding his fingers into his fur. He'd be staying here for a long, long time. Honestly, that was perfectly alright for everyone involved. ","Summary":" \"Percy!\" Brenda called from her place on the female yeti's shoulder. Percy looked over, mildly su"},{"Movie":"Rock and Rule","Title":"The Search","Author":"duchessofbooks","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10909061","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prologue Mok, the retired rock star knew he was dreaming and it was not a pleasant one. The dream was featuring memories of his childhood, the ones he wished to lock away forever. The first memory was of a young Mok taking a bath and being looked after by his father, Bull. Suddenly, Bull pushed Mok and held him under the water. The young Mok was struggling to get his head above water and his lungs were burning. Then, someone pulled him out and he began to choke. \"Mok!\" a female voice cried out, it was his mother, Cherine. Cherine wrapped him in a towel and held him tight to her chest. She said something in French to Bull, but he cries out, \"Your idiot son slipped and almost drowned!\" Mok saw an angry frown on his mother's face, she knew her husband was lying. \"Don't give me that look, I know what I saw!\" Bull shouted and Cherine took her son out of the bathroom. The memory began to change and it featured the young Mok with Cherine, she was teaching him to sing. \"What is this?\" an irritated voice said in the doorway of Mok's bedroom. It was Bull, he had a bottle of whiskey in one hand and he was drunk. \"Are you trying to annoy me with that so called singing?\" Bull asked, again. Cherine and Mok said nothing and Bull adds, \"You know why I named you Mok? Because you're a mockery to me.\" Bull wobbled out of the room and Cherine hugs her son. She says in French, \"Don't pay any attention to him. He does not know how special you are. I know that one day you are going to do something big. Then, your father will be eating those words.\" \"But why does he hate me?\" Mok asked in French. \"It's the alcohol, it does awful things to you,\" Cherine answered and they resumed their singing lessons. The memory changed to the day where Mok received his scar. The young Mok was minding his schoolwork, when Bull wobbled into the room with a vodka bottle in hand. Mok saw him and a look of fear was shown on his face. \"You doing work?\" Bull asked and the young Mok gave a nod. \"School is bullshit nowadays, waste of money,\" Bull said and a took a drink. \"Why I didn't bother going to school most of the time, but my parents forced me. After high school I got the hell out of town and began to work my ass off to make ends meet. The world is full of shit-brains, just like my boss.\" Mok realized that Bull was walking closer to him, but he stayed put. \"You want to know why I'm home early?\" Bull asked. Mok really didn't want to know, but his father says, \"I got fired! For being drunk on the job! I'm not drunk! Am I?\" Bull shouted at the young boy. Mok did not say anything, but suddenly, Bull slammed the bottle against the wall and it shattered. \"Not talking?\" Bull asked and held up the shard, \"Well why don't I make you?\" Suddenly, Bull slashed across Mok's body and a wave of pain hit him. The boy looked down to see crimson red bloom on his shirt from his stomach to his shoulder. The young Mok gripped at his bleeding cut and collapsed to the floor. The memory faded into a new one, this time it featured Mok as a young man. He was returning home from a long night of playing music, singing, and performing magic at a night club. Mok was saving money so he and his mother could leave Bull for good. Right now, Mok only had enough to support himself and he hoped the next gig would pay more money. Before he entered his apartment complex, Mok heard screams and shouts coming from inside. He quickly went inside and to his horror, he saw Bull beating Cherine in the gut. \"You're leaving me, aren't you?! You and that stupid boy! You think the world resolves around you! You stupid bitch!\" Bull yelled and slaps Cherine. At that moment, something in Mok snapped. Without thinking, he charged at Bull and threw him to the floor. Bull looked up in surprise, \"You! You have the guts to stand up to me! I would not be surprised to know that you're not my son!\" he shouted and clamps his hands around Mok's throat. Bull slammed him against the counter, tightening his grip. Mok looked around and right there was a knife. He took it in his hand and thrust it into Bull's chest. Bull stopped throttling Mok and blood spewed out of his mouth. Bull let go of Mok's throat and fell to the floor, dead. \"Mok! Mok!\" someone was shouting outside of his dream. Angel gently shook her husband's shoulders, but he would not wake up. Having no choice, Angel took her glass of water she kept on the side table and dumped it on Mok. With that, he woke up with a gasp and saw that he was wet. \"Sorry,\" Angel said, \"You were crying out in your sleep. I tried to wake you, but you wouldn't.\" \"No, I should be sorry,\" Mok replied, \"My mind was replaying my memories, the ones of my father.\" \"That must be worse than a nightmare,\" Angel said and loops her arms around him. Mok laid his head down on the pillow and Angel looks at him with concern. \"Are you okay now? Is it something you to talk about?\" she asked and Mok looks at her. He had been thinking about of the memories and of his mother. It had been over twenty years since he last her at that apartment of horrors. After he stabbed his father, Cherine ordered her son to take all of his savings and whatever he can carry and leave and never come back. Mok didn't want to leave, but Cherine insisted that he had to go. He knew she was protecting him from a fate not meant for him. \"Angel,\" he said and she looks at him, \"I have a huge favor to ask you.\" \"Sure, anything,\" Angel replied. \"It's my mother, Cherine, I want you to find out what happened to her after I left her twenty years ago,\" Mok said to her. Angel knew that her husband had been thinking of finding his mother for a very long time. She really wanted to help him and she nods her head. \"When I go to work in the morning, I will see what I can dig up,\" Angel answered and Mok kisses her. \"Thank you,\" he said, then he kissed her and they settled down to sleep, again. From the author: I had this story at the top of my head for a long time. When I first watched 'Rock n Rule', I saw Mok as someone who experienced a lot of tragedy in his life, being abused by his father was one of them. Stick around for more chapters.[Chapter 2] Chapter 1 Angel decided not to waste time in searching for Mok's mother, Cherine Swagger. The good news was that there was no crime committed in the pass few days, which meant no paper work to fill out. Angel went on her computer at work and typed in Cherine's name in the search bar. To her surprise, there were a few news stories about her and an old crime report from over twenty years ago. Angel read the crime report, it stated that Cherine was found in her apartment, with her husband's body in the kitchen. One of her neighbors had heard her screaming and phoned police. Cherine had internal injuries and bruises all over her body when she was taken to a hospital. The doctors had also found hairline fractures to her bones and old ones, too. Cherine was taken into protective custody until the police decided that she killed her husband in self-defense and filed no charges against her. However, the police did ask where her son, Mok had gone, but Cherine refused to tell them. After a few days in protective custody, Cherine was allowed to leave, but shortly after her release, she vanished. Her husband, whose real name was Redford Swagger, his bank account had emptied out in one day and she left everything in her apartment. Angel finished reading the report, she read some of the news stories, but they gave no clue where Cherine had gone. She went through birth records on Cherine, but there was none in her name. Angel called her husband and asks him what Cherine's maiden name was. \"I'll try to remember, she told me once, but now it is lost inside my head,\" Mok answered and they disconnected. Then, an idea came to Angel's head; since Cherine had lived in Mystic Rock Harbor, the crime may have been handled by Angel's boss, Captain Davey Biggins. She goes to his office and Davey summons her in. \"Angel, is there something wrong?\" he asked and she takes a deep breath. \"You have worked in the force for what? Thirty years?\" she asked him and he nods. \"I was a rookie when I entered, as you were, why do you ask?\" Biggins said, again. \"I must beg you to keep this a secret,\" Angel replied and adds, \"I am working to find my husband's mother, Cherine Swagger.\" Biggins stared at Angel with wide eyes, \"Cherine Swagger you say? Oh my God,\" he said and leans back in his chair. \"What do you mean?\" Angel asked, again. \"I remember Cherine and the case; it was god-awful for what happened to her. Her husband beating the hell out of her before she killed him, it was clearly self-defense. I gave her some coffee the first night she was here. She had a cut-lip, a black eye, and I was told she was treated for internal injuries and even hairline fractures,\" Biggins explained. \"Tell me,\" Angel said, \"What do you know of Redford? Mok's father.\" Biggins began to think and then, he went through a file cabinet and pulled out some papers. \"I keep the interesting cases here,\" he said and hands a file to Angel. She took it to her desk and began to read the birth record of Redford Swagger. Redford was born in Vancouver, but he was abandoned at an orphanage where he spent all of his early years there. When he turned eighteen, Redford was released from the orphanage's custody and went to Mystic Rock Harbor where he got a job at a liqour store, where he was introduced to alcohol. He was arrested multiple times for being intoxicated in public and driving drunk. When Redford turned twenty-five, he married Cherine and that was when the abuse began. Cherine called police one time and Redford was arrested for domestic violence, but the charges were dropped as requested by Cherine. That was the only time Redford was arrested for domestic violence, but there were calls from neighbors about verbal disputes from the Swagger apartment complex. Angel thought of Cherine and Mok, living in that apartment with a man who would lose his temper and abuse them at every turn. Angel remembered what Mok said to her about his father, whom he called Bull for he had a temperment of one. Mok stated that his father threatened Cherine about committing suicide and he would make it look like Cherine murdered him. Angel remembered that her violent boyfriend, Omar had made a similar threat and she had to stay in the relationship before meeting Mok. She then read the report of Redford's death and Cherine's submission to protective custody. Angel read Cherine's statement about the abuse she endured for twenty years. According to the autopsy report, Redford died from a single stab to the heart from the knife that was emplanted in his chest. When Cherine was asked about her son, she refused to say anything about Mok. The police searched for him throughout the British Columbia province, but he was nowhere to be found. Angel felt relived that Mok had escaped to Ohmtown in time as he would've been arrested for his father's murder. However, Angel suspected that the police would've taken his statement about Redford trying to kill him and his mother. \"Why did Cherine order him to leave?\" Angel asked herself. She suspected that Cherine was protecting her son, perhaps from being prosecuted for his father's murder. Angel finished reading the file, but it gave no clue in where Cherine had gone after being released. She went to ask her boss, \"Where did Cherine go after you released her?\" Biggins shrugged his shoulders. \"I don't know. After the case was closed, we got a call from the bank stating that Redford Swagger's bank account had been emptied out. The chief at the time went to check on Cherine, but he discovered that she was not at her apartment. He had everyone on the force look for her, but she had just disappeared from the face of the earth.\" Angel asks, \"Did she give out a maiden name? Is there anything useful that might help me in this investigation?\" Biggins looked through his desk and his private journal, but he shakes his head. \"There's nothing in the file that has info like that?\" he asked, but Angel shakes her head. \"I'm afraid I can't help you, Cherine never spoke of her past life. Maybe your husband has his mother's maiden name locked away in his memory somewhere,\" Biggins said and Angel leaves the office. Angel began to think and thought of something. She went on her computer and went through marriage certificates and found Redford Swagger and Cherine Beaulieu. Then, Angel's phone rang and she answered to hear her husband's voice. \"Angel, I just remembered my mother's last name, Beaulieu,\" he said. \"I know, I'm looking at your parents' marriage certificate,\" Angel replied. \"What else did you find out?\" Mok asked, he sounded curious and anxious. \"I will tell you when I get home,\" she said and she bid goodbye. Angel looked up on Cherine Beaulieu and found some immigration papers online. To Angel's surprise, Cherine was actually born in Paris, France and she immigrated to Canada after her twenty-first birthday and met Redford Swagger while she was on vacation. They got married a year later and that was when the trouble began. Angel looked up on the Beaulieu family, but found nothing. She kept looking through the Internet, but there was nothing on Cherine's family. \"Did you find anything?\" Biggins asked Angel when she decided to go home for the day. \"A lot,\" she answered and explained to him about Redford and Cherine Beaulieu. \"That is quite amazing,\" Biggins said. \"I still need to find info on the Beaulieu family in France,\" Angel replied and Biggins allowed her to go home. Angel sat in her car for a few minutes and thought of some possibilites about Cherine. She could've been an orphan, too, but a name like Beaulieu sounded really important. Angel drove home and looked around the town. It had been a month since the powerful storm came and knocked the electricity out. Everyone had gone crazy during that time, including one family man named Alan Middleton who murdered his family on the night of the storm. When Angel arrived and parked in the driveway, she became aware of a sound coming from inside the house. It sounded very familiar to her, strings of a violin. That was when it hit her and she immediately rushed inside. From the author: Who is the mystery guest? Find out next time![Chapter 3] Chapter 2 Angel rushed up the stairs and into the living room where she found the male dog-humanoid violinist. He wore a wrinkled shirt and overalls and a cap. He played magnificently on the old violin and the strings played a wonderful tone, one that Angel recognized. When he finished playing, he took a bow as Emmy clapped her hands frantically. Harold the violinist gave a bow and he turned to face Angel. \"Angel, it's so good to see you, again,\" he said and they shared a hug. \"Did the wind blew you back here?\" Angel asked and Harold chuckled. \"Yes it did and it was a good thing I came by,\" he said, referring to Emmy, who was checking out his violin case. The adults sat outside on the patio and were served some cold drinks. Harold told Angel and Mok about what he had been up to. \"I've been all along the east coast, all the way down to Florida. Oh, before I forget, Rhonda Legrand is still on death row and they tore down the Black Widow and made it into a sanctuary for trafficked women and children,\" Harold explained and Angel felt a sense of relief. She had horrible memories of her time as a sex slave at the Black Widow Casino Hotel, which was almost four years ago. Angel had been sold by her boyfriend, Omar for drugs and the dealers took her to Miami, where she became a plaything for men at the hotel. If Mok had not saved her and the other women at the hotel, Angel was sure she would stay there until Rhonda killed her for not following the rules or stop getting customers. \"Mok has told me of your cases, I never thought this town would go through anything like murder,\" Harold said to Angel and she nods, but she then remembered her search earlier. \"Mok, I have found some interesting details about your parents,\" Angel said and she saw Mok's ears perk up and he stared at her. \"Go on, I'm listening,\" he replied and gave his full attention and Harold also listened in. \"Your father was really named Redford, he was born in Vancouver, but he was abandoned after birth and was left at an orphanage where he spent his early life there. After he was eligible to live on his own, he moved to Mystic Rock Harbor and got a job at a liquor store and he was introduced to alcohol. \"He met Cherine, your mother when he was twenty-five and they got married a year later. He was arrested one time for domestic violence a few weeks after they got back from their honeymoon, but the charges were dropped at Cherine's request. Police were called a few times at the apartment they lived for verbal disputes, but no arrests were made,\" Angel explained and Mok leaned back in his chair. \"And what happened after I...left my mother?\" he asked. \"Cherine was taken into protective custody and she was treated for internal injuries. Biggins was a rookie at the time of the case and he did say Cherine had hairline fractures,\" Angel answered. \"She didn't go to jail?\" Mok asked, again. \"No, the judge decided not to press charges as they believed it was self-defense and Cherine was allowed to leave. However, Biggins' boss at the time did go to check on her, but she had left and Redford's bank account had been emptied out,\" Angel said and Mok pressed two fingers to his tear ducts. \"Did you find anything about her past life?\" he asked. \"All I know is that Cherine Beaulieu was born in Paris and she immigrated to Canada after her twenty-first birthday and she met Redford while she was vacationing here,\" Angel answered and Mok stared at her with wide eyes. \"Paris? In France?\" he said and Angel nods, \"That is quite amazing. I never thought she was born in Europe because she never told me of her past life,\" he adds. \"At first, I thought she was an orphan, too, but a name like Beaulieu sounds really important,\" Angel replied and Mok scratches under his chin. \"If you don't mind, I would like to use M.A.I. in my search. I think she might help in finding the Beaulieu family,\" she said. \"By all means,\" he replied and Angel gets up from her chair and kisses Mok's forehead. She then went inside and located M.A.I., the supercomputer Mok created. Angel went into the room where M.A.I. was kept and she says, \"M.A.I., I have a request for you.\" \"What can I do for you, Miss Angel,\" the female voice asked and M.A.I. face appeared on the screen. \"I wish to locate the whereabouts of the Beaulieu family in France and maybe see if there is any living members, please,\" Angel said and an infinity symbol appeared on the screen. \"Begin search,\" M.A.I. replied and the symbol looped around. \"How long will it take?\" Angel asked. \"May take hours or a day, I will do my best in my search,\" the supercomputer replied and Angel nods. \"Let me know when you have completed your search,\" Angel said and leaves the room. She looked into her daughter's room and saw Harold teaching Emmy how to play the violin. The strings would screech and the notes did not come out right, but Harold was patient and showed her how to proper place the violin on her shoulder. Angel leaves them alone and locates her husband still out on the patio, staring out into space. She sat down beside him and she noticed tears in his eyes. \"If my mother did leave this town, she must've gone back to France,\" Mok said to Angel. \"You believe she's alive?\" she asked and he nods. \"For over twenty years I always believed she was alive and she was looking for me, too,\" Mok replied and Angel comes to his side. \"If M.A.I. finds any living Beaulieu family member, we'll ask them where she is,\" she said and they shared a kiss. \"I appreciate in what you are doing,\" Mok said and kisses her, again. \"Only because you asked me to. You know, I should do the same in finding my parents' killer,\" Angel replied and he looks at her. \"You'll probably have to go back to Ohmtown, are you willing to do so?\" he asked and Angel began to think. After her parents were murdered, Angel swore to herself that she would find their killer, and she applied to the Ohmtown Police Station and she would save the money from every paycheck in order to get into the forensic training at the police academy. All of that changed when she met Omar, who ordered her to quit and she had gone through two years of abuse. She tried her best to convince him to let her go back to work, but he refused and would sometimes beat her when she brought it up in a conversation. Angel decided not to bring up those memories and thought of the present. She was grateful of the life she had now; a loving husband, a daughter she loves, a wonderful job, and a good community she lives in. Yet she knew there was plenty of evil in this world and she wanted to protect Emmy from all of it. \"Angel?\" she heard Mok say and she snapped back into reality. \"Sorry I was thinking,\" she answered. \"Zip called, it's dinner time,\" he said and they went inside to have a polite conversation with Harold while eating. From the author: Liking it so far? I will keep you posted.[Chapter 4] Chapter 3 The Swagger's and their guest enjoyed their evening meal with a glass of wine, expect for Emmy who indulged on a cup of grape juice. \"Have you ever been to Italy, Harold?\" Angel asked. \"I've never been to Europe, always wanted to. If I could grow wings, I will head over there in an instant. Would you be heading to France? That is, you are looking for...\" Harold stopped talking as he knew discussing about Cherine would make Emmy ask a lot of questions. \"I always wanted to go to Italy,\" Angel said, as she never ventured out of North America before. \"You will love Europe,\" her husband, Mok said to her, \"They like foreigners. Of course, they like getting tourist money and such.\" \"Mommy,\" Emmy said, \"May I be excused?\" she asked. \"Yes, you can go,\" Angel replied and the little girl left the table. \"Sooner or later, she will hear about her grandmother,\" Harold said to the two. \"I never thought my mother would return to France, in fact, I never knew where she came from before coming here,\" Mok replied and refilled his wine glass. \"Once M.A.I. has finished searching for the Beaulieu family, then we will see if she did return to France,\" Angel pointed out and had her wine glass refilled. \"However, if she did not have any family here, then I would think she did return to Europe.\" \"After what happened to her, I would say she did return to France. I honestly believe that she and her family had some falling out of a sort before she moved here,\" Harold stated and continues, \"If she had told her family of what had happened, then they would welcome her back in. \"I had a cousin who had a big fight with her father and she ran away one night. Now her father did say he hated her, but when she left, he did break down in tears,\" Harold explained, \"He spent his entire time and his money to locate her. Turns out she was at a bus station, but she had no money to leave West Virginia.\" \"If it does take time and money to search for my mother, I don't mind at all,\" Mok said and finished his wine. \"Mok, when was the last time you went to France?\" Angel asked, she wondered if he may have seen Cherine, that is, if she was in France at the time. \"Well, the first time was my first European tour, which was about...15 or maybe at least 18 years ago and it was a terrible experience in France at that time,\" he answered and explains, \"Emmy, my girlfriend was suffering the final stages of cancer and on the first night of the concert in Paris I received news that she collapsed in our hotel room. \"I decided to delay the concert and visited Emmy in her hospital room. She insisted, no, more like ordered me to go and sing for my fans,\" Mok continued with the story. \"But that did not end there. In the middle of one of my songs, I litterly stopped and started sobbing. I'm talking buckets of tears.\" Angel rubbed her husband's back and says, \"You loved her, that is what matter to you during that time.\" \"How did your fans react?\" Harold asked, rather curiously. \"They started shouting in French, but I don't remember what they said. I think a few said 'Do it for Emmy!'. So, I started the song over and it was a hit with them,\" Mok answered and takes one of Angel's hands. \"I decided to cancel the rest of my tour,\" he added. \"So you did not see anyone that looked familiar to you?\" Angel asked. \"I did not see my mother in the crowd, I was not paying attention to the fans. All I cared about during that was Emmy,\" Mok said and he kissed Angel's hand. \"Harold,\" Emmy, their daughter said, \"Would you play that song, again?\" \"Sure,\" he answered and took out his violin. He tuned it and began to play 'Short Trip Home'. Angel felt entranced by the song as always as she loved to listen to that song. When she first heard it in Miami, where she and Mok met Harold, it was a wonderful experience as her fears withered away in the wind. As the song played, all of the stress Angel had been holding in was dying and she felt a weight lift from her shoulders. The moment the song ended, Angel came back into reality. \"Oh, why does it have to end?\" Emmy complained. \"I have it on a CD, of that concert,\" Mok said to his daughter and she got excited. \"You can play it over and over.\" \"But it sounds better in real life,\" Emmy stated and Angel agreed to that. \"Harold is tired from his journey, I believe he wishes to go to sleep,\" Mok said and Harold nodded at Emmy. \"Once I'm all rested, I'll play the song over and over,\" he said and placed the violin back in its case. Angel realized of how late it was for Emmy and she took her daughter's hand and says, \"It's pass your bedtime young lady.\" \"Can I stay up for five more minutes?\" Emmy pleaded. Angel could not turn down her little girl, but she had to set an example. \"Two minutes and it's bedtime,\" she ordered and Emmy rushed off to her room. Angel watched as Emmy listened to the CD that had Harold's violin songs. It was the last CD that Mok ever released as he had retired from the music business years before. When the two minutes were up, Emmy got into her night gown, brushed her teeth, and went to bed. Angel decided to retire to bed early as she was exhausted for some reason. She washed up in the shower, dried her hair, and went to bed. Her husband laid beside her a few minutes later and both were sound asleep. From the author: Stay tuned for more![Chapter 5] Chapter 4 That night, Angel and her husband were asleep in their bed, when Angel was gently shaken by someone. She grumbled a bit and looked to see Cindy. \"I'm sorry to bother you, but M.A.I. has found something,\" the employee said to her mistress. This was what Angel was waiting for and she hurried out of the bedroom. \"M.A.I., what do you have?\" Angel asked. \"I have found important information on Cherine Beaulieu and the Beaulieu family,\" the computer answered and she showed many electronic documents on the screen. Angel fought the fatigue in order to look through the documents, despite that her mind urged her to go to sleep. Angel read about the Beaulieu family and was surprised to learn that Cherine was the descendent of a French king. The Beaulieu family had so much wealth that they lived on a country estate that had four hundred acres. Angel then looked at Cherine's Canadian Immigration Certificate and at the exit visia that was made months after Redford's death. Angel was stumped; she thought that Cherine had immediately left the country after the case was closed. Then, she saw a marriage certificate from France and two birth certificates, also from France. To Angel's surprise, Cherine had married, again, and had two children in France. Angel then felt a presence and turned to see Mok behind her, he had been reading the documents. \"How...?\" was all he could say. \"Mok, I know this a lot to handle, but I believe your mother spent all of her time and money to search for you,\" Angel replied, holding him by the shoulders. \"I highly doubt it,\" he said in an angry tone. \"Listen, she protected you from being persecuted for your father's murder,\" Angel said to him. \"And with that, she left to start a new life,\" Mok replied, bitterly. Just then, M.A.I. came back on. \"I have found a new document,\" she said and featured a news article that was in French. Mok read it over and translated for Angel. \"Countess Cherine Beaulieu-Desrosiers, age 87 was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and has made a tremendous come-back. Unfortunately, the cancer has returned and the aging countess has no fight left in her. \"The countess was informed that she has less than two months to live as the cancer has reached her spline.\" Mok stopped talking after he read that and tears formed in his eyes. Angel could tell that it was too much to bear. He then looks at the article and continues reading. \"The countess's son, Phillipe informed the Paris media that his dying mother wishes to have a special performance by Mok Swagger at her chateau later in the month.\" \"Mok, did you hear that, she wants to see you!\" Angel exclaimed and he did hear it, but his face fell when he continued to read. \"However, the countess's request could not be granted as the legendary rock star could not be reached at his Ohmtown residence.\" \"Ohmtown? Why contact there?\" Angel asked. \"France must've not heard the news of my return to Mystic Rock Harbor. News does travel slow,\" Mok replied. \"Mok, you need to go to France, this will be your last chance to reunite with Cherine,\" Angel said and he nods. \"And I'm taking you and Emmy with me,\" he replied and they scurried out of the room. \"And let's forget Harold, he would like to see France,\" Angel said and she went into the guest bedroom to awaken Harold. Mok ordered Sleazy to go to the airport and prepare the private jet. Angel awakened Emmy, but the young girl didn't wake up right away. \"Emmy, listen, we're going to France,\" Angel said, but that didn't rouse her daughter. Angel then packed some clothes for Emmy and had Cindy carry the girl to the car. \"Do we have everything?\" Angel asked her husband. Mok locked the front door to the house and they got into the car and Toad drove away towards the airport. When they arrived, the Swaggers and Harold hurried into the jet. \"We're ready,\" Mok said to Sleazy and the pilot made last minute adjustments. Angel was surprised that Emmy slept through the entire car ride to the airport and the little girl still didn't wake up. \"Gosh, I didn't know she could sleep through anything,\" Cindy said to her mistress. \"She usually never does,\" Angel pointed out. \"Hey little Miss Emmy,\" Cindy said into the girl's ear and Emmy moaned a little and turned about. She then woke up and looked around. \"Where are we?\" Emmy asked. \"We're going to France,\" Angel answered and Emmy's eyes grew wide. \"Why?\" she asked, again. \"To see your grandmother,\" Angel replied and Emmy looked confused. \"I didn't know I had a grandma,\" she said, just as the jet roared to life. It then ascended into the sky, away from Mystic Rock Harbor and all of Canada. Mok looked out of the window, looking down on the Earth, he was always fascinated by it as it did look like a clay model. Angel came beside him. \"Are you all right?\" she asked. \"I am,\" he replied, still looking out. \"It's going to be okay, you'll see,\" Harold insisted and Mok nods. \"I just hope she is still alive,\" Mok said and Angel kisses his forehead. \"She is and she will probably flip when she sees you,\" she informed him. The four then slumbered down and were asleep in little time as it was going to be a long trip to Europe. From the author: Sorry for not updating, suffered from writer's block, but I am back in the game![Chapter 6] Chapter 5 \"Boss,\" Mok heard one of his employees say and he woke up from a long slumber. \"We're about to land in Paris,\" Zip told his employer. Angel and Emmy also woke up and the little girl looked out the window of the jet to see a new landscape. They had arrived in Europe. \"Good,\" Mok replied and they prepared themselves for landing. \"Is grandma living here?\" Emmy asked. \"Yes,\" Angel answered, \"But we have to look for her first.\" A few minutes later, the jet landed on the tarmac of Paris' airport. It was close to the afternoon and Angel and Mok set their watches to the current time in Paris. Once the jet was settled, Mok had Toad prepare a limo for the journey to the countryside. Angel pointed out that Cherine's current address was in a chateau in the Picardie region. Emmy had her nose to the window and she stared at the amazing architecture of Paris. Even Angel and Harold were amazed by the many buildings, some had even survived the Nuclear War that happened a thousand years ago. Mok, however, was worried about the possibility that his mother was dead and he had not made it to see her. \"Mok, it's going to be okay,\" Angel said to him. \"I know, but what if she's dead and I'm too late to see her?\" Mok replied and Angel had him lay his head on her shoulder. \"Don't think of that, think about when you see her and how excited she will be when she sees you,\" Angel insisted and Mok nods. \"I'll try,\" he replied and closes his eyes. The trip was long as the Picardie region was not that far from Paris, but Toad was not familiar with the new landscape. \"I wonder if I can start a new journey here in Europe?\" Harold asked and Angel looks at him. \"Are you sure? I mean, no offense, but you don't know any European languages,\" she replied, but Harold just laughed. \"Me? Parlo italiano, spagnolo e franese,\" Harold spoke in Italian and Angel stares at him. \"How come you never told me?\" she asked, as she was irritated. \"Don't know, never thought I would use them one day,\" Harold replied with a grin. Then, Angel noticed that they were in the French countryside and her eyes grew wide at the vast landscape of vineyards. \"This place is beautiful,\" she commented and Mok nods. Suddenly, Toad slammed on the brakes and Mok shouts, \"What is wrong with you?!\" \"Uh, sir, we have a problem,\" Toad replied and Mok opened the door and stepped out. Ahead of them was a group of dog and cat humanoids wearing black suits and they were staring at the limo and Mok. \"Qui êtes-vous?!\" Mok shouted at them, \"Sortez de la route, nous avons des affaires importantes!\" \"You can save your French for later!\" one of them called out and a dog humanoid with white skin and brown hair stepped forward and walked up to the limo. \"Are you Mok Swagger?\" the dog human asked. \"Yes,\" the retired rock star answered. The dog humanoid smiled at him and says, \"I've been dreaming of this day and so has Cherine, our mother. I'm Phillipe, your half-brother.\" Mok looks at Phillipe, his eyes were wide with surprise and Angel was also surprised to hear it, too. \"I don't want to keep you waiting, Cherine would be thrilled to see you after twenty years,\" Phillipe said and had the henchmen move aside. \"The chateau is just down this road,\" Phillipe added and he returned to his car, while Mok got into his. \"Mok, I am a bit suspicious of him. I mean, how did he know we were coming?\" Angel asked. \"I don't know, if he is toying with us, I'll permit you to shoot him,\" Mok replied and he did sound serious. The limo followed Phillipe's car down the road, where it turned into dirt and the land featured grapevines. \"Mommy, look!\" Emmy exclaimed and pointed out a French style home that almost looked like a palace. It had the color of the landscape and it did look spotless. Mok's eyes grew wider and Angel knew her suspicions were wrong. The limo stopped at the entrance, where a servant in old period clothing opened the door for the Swaggers. There were many servants lined up against the stairway and they were looking at the family. Then, a female dog humanoid came the steps in a hurried pace and she looks hard at Mok. She says in French, \"Es-tu mon demi-frère?\" Mok looks at her with shock and asks in French, \"Qui êtes-vous?\" Then Phillipe appears beside the woman, \"Mok, this is Laurette, your half-sister,\" he informed him. In a flash, Laurette threw her arms around Mok in a tight hug, \"Mon frère!\" she exclaimed and Mok could not help it, but hug her back and began to cry. After a few moments, the three siblings collected themselves and Mok introduced his wife and daughter. \"Oh, quelle belle fille que vous avez,\" Laurette said to Mok and she looks at Angel, \"Et vous avez une belle femme.\" Angel barely remembered French, but she was sure that Laurette said beautiful daughter and wife. \"Come, our mother is waiting,\" Phillipe said to Mok and they followed him up the steps and into the palace-style chateau. Angel felt like she stepped into the past as the interior looked like it was made for European royalty. Of course she remembered that the Beaulieu family was said to be descended from a French king. \"I will tell you about this place once you are settled,\" Phillipe replied and they followed him to a bedroom where it looked like it was meant for a queen. \"This way,\" Phillipe said and lead them to a door and opened it. Angel held Emmy back as Mok entered the room, but she could see that there was an old female dog humanoid in the queen-sized bed. The woman had a hand to her eyes as if she had been crying and she looks up and stares at Mok. The old woman stared at him with her wide blue eyes and the two remained still for a long time. The silence was broken when Cherine says in a whisper, \"Mon fils.\" Author's Note: Cliffhanger! I want the excitement to build up before the next chapter! Stay tuned![Chapter 7] Chapter 6 \"Mon fils,\" Cherine said, again and tears rolled down Mok's cheeks. He slowly stepped forward towards the bed, but then Cherine got to her feet. Phillipe and Laurette entered in, but Cherine says, \"Non! Je peux le faire!\" She walked slowly towards Mok with no help and places a cold, shaky hand on his cheek. She looks into his eyes and smiles. They embraced in a tight hug and sat down on the floor. Cherine says, \"Oh my son, I've been dreaming of this day.\" \"I have, too, mère,\" Mok replied and Cherine began to kiss all over his face. She then noticed Angel and Emmy at the doorway and opened up her arms. Emmy rushed in and Cherine embraced her granddaughter. \"Oh, je dois une belle petite-fille,\" Cherine said and looks up at Angel and she summons her to come into the circle. Mok introduced his family to his mother and Cherine kissed both Angel and Emmy on the forehead. \"Oh my son, you have a beautiful family,\" Cherine commented, but then she grunted as if in pain. Mok and Phillipe helped her up and placed her on a comfortable chair. \"It's the cancer,\" Phillipe said. \"Mais il est pas aussi mauvais que le médecin dit qu'il le ferait,\" Laurette replied, but Angel did not understand that. \"She said that the cancer is not as bad as the doctor expected it to be,\" Phillipe translated for her and Emmy. \"The doctor is a fool,\" Cherine replied, \"I'm just old, my body has enough fight left.\" Mok embraced his mother again and Angel could not help but tear up as she knew her husband was happy to be reunited with Cherine. Harold entered in and Cherine noticed him, \"Who is this?\" she asked. \"I'm Harold,\" he replied and gives a bow. \"He plays the violin,\" Emmy said and Cherine looked surprised. \"Oh, I barely remember those instruments,\" she replied and Harold placed his violin case on the ground and opened it. He tuned his violin and Emmy exclaims, \"Play that one song!\" Harold smiled and began to play 'Short Trip Home', his signature song. Angel looked around the room, she found some medicine bottles beside the bed and discovered a photo album. In it were some photographs and newspaper clippings of Mok at a young age and his debut as a rock star. The newspaper articles were in French, but Angel did her best to translate them. She did come across one article where it featured Mok's concert in Paris eighteen years before. She read that Mok stopped in mid-song and had an emotional breakdown, but the crowd urged him to do it for his dying girlfriend, Emmy. Then she saw a clipping of Mok's last concert and of his proposal to Angel. She remembered that night as if it was yesterday. Then, she found a photo of her, Mok, and their daughter Emmy outside of their house in Mystic Rock Harbor. Angel did not hear Harold stop playing, but she heard Cherine say, \"I hired private investigators to locate Mok after his last concert. I was surprised and releaved to see that he was alive after the fire at his mansion in Ohmtown.\" Angel could not help it, but she really wanted to ask questions about what Cherine had been through before and after Redford Swagger's death. \"Cherine, forgive me, but I have so many questions to ask you,\" Angel said and the old woman chuckled. \"Curieux êtes-vous?\" Cherine asked and Angel nods. \"Let's take a stroll in the gardens,\" Cherine added and had Phillipe bring in a wheelchair. \"Si cela ne vous dérange pas, je veux être avec eux,\" Cherine said to Phillipe and Laurette. \"Mais la mère,\" Phillipe replied, but Cherine held up a hand. Phillipe and Laurette stand aside for Cherine, Mok, Angel, and Emmy to leave the room. ()()()()()()()()() Angel had never seen a garden that looked so luxurious before, apart from Mok's garden back home. There were many green hedges that had different shapes, hybrid flowers and even ancient ones that survived the nuclear fallout, and there were plenty of fountains. \"I want the two to know something first,\" Cherine said to Angel and Mok, \"I don't trust Phillipe, he is more like my second husband, Comte Constantin Desrosiers. Truth be told, I barely spent any time with him as my thoughts were on you Mok. Phillipe knows that, so I want you to keep a suspicious eye on him.\" Emmy then ran around the stone statues and hid somewhere among them and her father decided to join in. \"Where did she go? Did she disappear? Did she turn invisible?\" Mok asked out loud and the others chuckled. \"Miss Angel,\" Cherine said and the two women went to a stone bench. \"I was told that you are a police detective, but you and I have something in common. \"You and I were victims of domestic violence,\" Cherine said and Angel nods. \"So was Mok, but he did suffer after he...he...\" \"Killed his father?\" Angel whispered and Cherine nods. \"I was told that he used drugs for quite some time before quitting the first time and that was with Emmy, his girlfriend,\" the old woman said. \"Yes,\" Angel replied. \"But when I saw him moments ago, I realized that he had recovered and found someone,\" Cherine said and looks at Angel. \"I will tell you how and why I met Redford. \"It was over forty years ago in Mystic Rock Harbor, I was a teenager with a group of friends on vacation. I was young and you could say I was stupid,\" Cherine began, but Angel shook her head. \"You were not stupid, you didn't know Redford's true nature,\" Angel said and Cherine chuckled. \"Well, yes that, and I did smoke and drink. I was free as a bird,\" Cherine replied and continued with her story. \"My friends and I were out one night and we were drunk. We must've taken a wrong turn back to our hotel when we walked pass a shady man. He was strong and he had eyes of a snake. \"The next thing I knew, he jumped on one of my friends and we tried to get him off her. We threw our purses at him as we thought it was a robbery, but he began to choke on my friend. We pulled and pushed on him, but he would not budge. \"I took a glass bottle and smashed it against his head and he turned his attention on me. He was enraged and I knew I was going to die. \"Then suddenly, a man got up on him and placed a choke hold on him. He choked him to the point where the snake man collapsed and he stopped moving. \"The man who saved us insisted that we leave the area immediately. I wanted to call the police, but the man refused and we went back to our hotel. \"Our rescuer introduced himself as Redford Swagger andhe said that he knew the person who attacked us. He said 'It's about time that I did that.' I don't know what happened next, but the next thing I knew I fell in love with him. \"It was stupid as the next couple of days, we dated and got to know each other. When it was time for me to go home to France, I decided to stay in Canada a bit longer with Redford. \"My parents were upset with me when I told them that I wanted to stay in Canada for the rest of my life and that I wanted to marry Redford. My father cut me off financial, but my mother sent me a few thousand francs to help get by with the wedding and such. \"However, things changed after Redford and I got home after our honeymoon. He asked when my mother will give us more money, but the money we received for our wedding was all that she gave us. Redford was furious and then he punched me in the face. \"He apologized immediately, but I knew that I made a dreadful mistake. I asked one time if I could go out and find a job in order to help out with the rent, but he forbid me from leaving the apartment as he said he will be the only one working. \"I did find a job working as a cashier in a hardware store and I was able to convince Redford that I was going out for a walk or going grocery shopping. I was also able to work out a schedule so that I could get home in time before Redford. \"However, he did find out and he was enraged. I will never forget that evening,\" Cherine said, but Angel held up a hand. \"You don't have to go into details,\" Angel replied, but Cherine shakes her head. \"He raped me that evening and that was the only time I called the police. They took him to jail, but when I visited him, he pleaded to forgive him as his temper got the best of him. I wish I didn't, but I did forgive him and had the charges dropped. \"However, that was not the end. He had a drinking problem and he was more verbally abusive when he was drunk. I tried to convince him to go and get help, but he refused and almost every night, he raped me despite my protests.\" \"And it was one of the rapes that got you pregnant with Mok?\" Angel asked and Cherine nods. \"Redford hated children and when I told him, he ordered me to get an abortion. I decided to not do it as I knew this child would change the world in some way. Redford was oblivious during my whole pregnancy as he didn't take notice of my extending belly as he thought I did abort the baby. \"I went into labor one morning when Redford already left for work and I had a neighbor take me to the hospital. When Mok was born, my whole world became a little brighter. However, Redford was informed by the hospital and he arrived just as Mok was taken. \"He told the doctor that he would name the baby Mok as he was a mockery to him. I got really upset, but I hid it when the doctor wrote his name on the birth certificate. He was doomed with that name. I wanted to name him Désiré as I desired to have him. \"From then on, Redford did not just focus on me, he targeted Mok at every turn. I feel so ashamed for having him to grow up with a violent father, but the truth was that I had no money and where would he and I go if we chose to leave Redford. \"I did decide to leave Redford after he attacked Mok in a drunken rage. We went back to the apartment after Mok was stitched up, but it was a dreadful mistake. Redford came home and pleaded with me to stay, but I refused to listen to him. \"Redford then took a knife and began to cut himself and said that he will committ suicide and make it look like that I killed him. I did not want that as I did not want Mok to taken away and put into foster care. I love my son, you understand that?\" Cherine asked and Angel nods. \"Years later, Mok was old enough to find work and he played in bars and nightclubs as he was good in magic and music. At first, Redford took all of his tips and paychecks for booze, but Mok was able to find a hiding place and hid his money from Redford. \"There was enough for Mok to leave Mystic Rock Harbor and get across the boarder and into the United States, but he insisted that he work more to get more for me. I don't know how Redford found out, but he did and that morning when Mok got home from a gig, Redford attacked me in a drunken fury.\" Angel knew what happened next, \"Mok killed him to save himself and you.\" \"Yes, but after that, I realized that the police would come. I didn't want my son to go to jail as I feared they would arrest him for murder. I ordered him to leave and never come back to Mystic Rock Harbor and to never find me. All I wanted was to protect him,\" Cherine explained to Angel and she nods. \"What happened afterward?\" Angel asked. \"The police found me and I told them that it was self-defense, which was the truth. They took me to the hospital, where they x-rayed me to check for broken bones. I did have a lot of bruises and they did find hairline fractures and old ones, too. \"The judge agreed with the police to not press charges on me and they took me back to the apartment. I began to look for anything that would help me get the money from Redford's bank account and I did find his journal where he kept all his passwords and such. \"I took everything out in cash in one setting and I left the town for good. I went across the boarder as I knew the police would be suspicious of Redford's empty account. I stayed in a town in California for a short time until I got the strength and courage to call my parents in France. \"I asked them if I could come home and they begged me to come back. I got on the first available plane ride to Paris, leaving Mok behind as I told myself that he was no longer my son, but it was dreadful when I heard myself say that. \"When I got here, my parents were happy and releaved to see me again. I begged them not to ask questions of what I have been doing for the pass twenty years and they never knew of my experience. I never even told them on their deathbeds. \"I got married again to the Comte Constantin Desrosiers and we did grow fond of each other and had Phillipe and Laurette. However, my mind was always set on Mok as he is my most beloved child. I am happy for him and I am happy that he found me as I was going to find him, but then this cancer crept up on me and I could not leave as I feared that Phillipe would do something to this estate,\" Cherine finished and Angel wanted to know something. \"What will Phillipe do?\" Angel asked. \"As I said, I don't trust him. You see, after Constantin died a few years ago I told Phillipe and Laurette of Mok. Phillipe was furious with me as he did suspect that I favored someone other than him. \"You see, before you came I made a new will and I fear that Phillipe would be angry with Mok and would want to kill him. I do fear that Phillipe will kill me someday as I did hide the will somewhere,\" Cherine explained and whispers a few things in Angel's ear. \"I trust you mostly out of my children. When I die, you go and bring my will to their attention,\" Cherine said to her daughter-in-law. \"But, what will Phillipe think if I do bring it up?\" Angel asked. \"I am sure he will be angry at me, but mostly at Mok. I don't know what Phillipe will do, but I'm afraid he will kill Mok in some way,\" Cherine replied. \"I'm just fearful for my son's life.\" \"I understand,\" Angel said, \"Just one last question. Did you go to any of Mok's concerts?\" \"I was planning to go eighteen years ago, when he was doing his tour in Europe, but he cancelled after the one concert in Paris. I was very upset as I thought it was my chance to reunite with him, but I understood that he loved Emmy, his girlfriend and that he was upset over her illness,\" Cherine explained. \"Come, let's take a walk through the vineyard,\" she added and stood up from her wheelchair. \"But don't you need that?\" Angel asked, but Cherine just chuckled. \"I still have some energy in me, I don't that stupid thing,\" she replied and Mok and Emmy rejoined them. The family walked through the rows of grapevines, they were red grapes for red wine and Emmy looked curiously at them. \"Can I eat them?\" she asked her grandmother. \"They are not the kind you normally eat, but I'll let you sample one,\" Cherine said and had a vineyard worker cut a piece. Emmy popped the red grape in her mouth and she made a face. \"Don't like it?\" Angel asked her daughter. \"Too...sweet...\" Emmy replied and forced herself to swallow the grape. Cherine laughed and they continued their tour of the vineyard. They stopped at the small processing plant where the grapes were crushed and processed into red wine. Cherine allowed Angel and Mok sample the finished product. \"This is very good,\" Angel commented and Cherine smiles. \"Come, I'll have the cooks whip up a feast tonight. I want to hear everything about what you have done for the pass twenty years, my son,\" Cherine said and they headed back to the main house. From the author: Nothing to say, except that this is a bittersweet reunion.[Chapter 8] Chapter 7 True to her word, Cherine had the cooks fix up a feast for that evening and the celebration was held outside where it was cool and comfortable. There was bisque, plenty of French cheeses, baguettes, and other French cuisines. There was even plenty of red wine to go around. Cherine had her son Mok talk about the times he had endured following his departure from Mystic Rock Harbor, his rise to fame, his settlement in Ohmtown, his abuse on drugs and rehab, and his return to his birthplace. \"Oh my son, you are living the life I dreamed of having,\" Cherine said and looks at Emmy and Angel. \"We did go through hard obstacles,\" Mok replied and his mother nods. \"It was all worth it,\" he added, which made Cherine smile. She then told Mok of what she said to Angel before and he was surprised when he heard all this. \"Constantin was a good man, he loved me no matter my status. He left me all this when he died,\" Cherine said. Angel looked at Cherine's other children, Phillipe and Laurette were looking as if they were left out of the conversation, so Angel decided to break the silence. \"Phillipe, Laurette, what else do you do besides looking after the vineyards?\" she asked. Phillipe translated for Laurette and the young woman said something in French, but Angel could not understand as her French was rusty. \"She said she is working in improving her English, but as you can see it is not working. Both of us went to university before our father died,\" Phillipe explained and continued. \"I am in charge of the business negotiations and Laurette looks after the company's labor force. I hope to take over my mother's position after she passes,\" Phillipe said. \"What does Cherine do?\" Angel asked him. \"She is in charge of the business; she pays the bills and gives orders to the workers. She even samples the wine that goes out,\" Phillipe explained. Angel found it hard to believe that Phillipe was dangerous, but she kept her instincts up. Nighttime came and the temperature dropped dramatically. The festivities came to an end and everyone settled in for the night. Cherine had her son and his family settle in a guest bedroom beside hers. Mok's employees even had rooms of their own. Mok and Cherine shared one last embrace before settling in for the night. She also shared a hug with Angel. \"Take this,\" she whispered and handed a piece of paper to Angel. Angel's vision was blurry and Cherine whispers, \"Hold on to it, it will lead you where I kept my will.\" Angel put the paper in her pocket and both she and her husband went to sleep. Everyone was drunk on wine, excluding Emmy who was quite awake. However, just as the Swaggers went into their bedroom, Phillipe went into Cherine's. In her bed, Emmy could barely sleep and she wanted to see her grandmother, so she snuck passed her sleeping parents' bed and went out of the room. She saw that her grandmother's door was ajar and she could hear voices. \"Mère, nous avons besoin de parler,\" Emmy heard her Uncle Phillipe's voice and she listened in. \"Phillipe, now is not a good time,\" Cherine insisted, but Phillipe gave a sniff. \"I want to know what you told that woman!\" he shouted, but Cherine tried to quiet him. Emmy knew he was referring to her mother and listened more carefully. \"Phillipe, I told her about my past life before I came home to France,\" Cherine said, but Phillipe only snorted. \"I don't believe you,\" Phillipe replied. \"It is the truth, pourquoi ne me croyez pas?\" his mother asked. \"You have been looking for Mok for years and your thoughts were on him, always on him, never on me,\" Phillipe said, angrily. \"He is my son, my first child. I love him and he helped me get through the hard times with Redford,\" Cherine replied in a calm tone. \"He does not know anything about the Desrosiers and their famous vineyards. I have the gut feeling that you changed your will, everything will go to him and his family. What about your legitimate children?\" Phillipe asked. \"Mok is my legitimate son, as you are,\" Cherine answered, but that made Phillipe even angrier. \"He is not a Desrosiers!\" he shouted and in a flash, he slapped his mother across the face. Emmy covered her mouth to hold back a whimper. \"Où est votre volonté?\" Phillipe demanded, but Cherine did not speak. \"Dites-moi ou je vais vous tuer,\" he adds in a threatening tone. Still, Cherine remained silent. Emmy decided to go back to bed, she hoped to see her grandma in the morning and tell her parents what had happened. In Cherine's room, mother and son continued to argue. \"Vous êtes juste comme Redford,\" she said to Phillipe. \"Il était un monstre,\" he replied, \"I am not a monster.\" \"Look what you just did to me,\" Cherine pointed to the fresh bruise on her cheek, but Phillipe denied the action. \"Le temps de prendre des mesures désespérées,\" he said in a cold voice and pulled out a white cloth. Before Cherine had time to react, her son placed the cloth over her mouth and she inhaled the scent and she blacked out. ()()()()()()()()()()()()()() Emmy tried to get to sleep, but she just couldn't with these new surroundings. She sensed that someone was beside her and she opened her eyes. Beside her was her half-uncle Phillipe and he looked angry. \"Je vais tuer votre maman et papa si vous leur parlez de cette,\" he said in a threatening voice, but Emmy did not understand French. \"That's right, you don't know French. Let me rephrase that; I will kill your mom and dad if you speak a word about what had happened,\" he said and Emmy became afraid of him. \"Now, be a good girl and go to sleep,\" Phillipe added in a now calming tone. Emmy placed a blanket over her face and pretended to be sleeping. Phillipe snuck passed Angel and Mok, both were in a deep slumber thanks to the wine, and Phillipe returned to his mother, who was still out cold. Phillipe placed her in her wheelchair and escorted her out of the mansion. Both went through one row of grapevines, Phillipe was heading towards an old house that was once used for the workers, but it remains abandoned. Phillipe suspected that this place would be safe enough for him to talk to his mother and get information from her. Cherine began to moan and Phillipe brought her into the house. She then woke up and saw her son and he looked mad. \"Essayons ce message,\" he said and pulled out a gun. \"Phillipe, que faites-vous?\" Cherine asked in a terrified tone. \"Dites-moi, où est-il?\" Phillipe asked in return and pointed the gun at her chest. Cherine did not talk, she was tough as nails, something she gained while she was married to Redford. She had to be tough, even with her son. She answers in English, \"You can torture me all you want, but it will not make a difference. I'll never tell you where my will is. I may have given birth to you and raised you, but I love my son Mok as much as you.\" Phillipe got angry, again, and in his thoughts, he wanted to shoot her, but if he did, he will be put in prison. Suddenly, there was a loud BANG! Phillipe realized that he had pulled the trigger and the bullet hit his mother in the shoulder. Blood gushed out of the wound and Cherine clutched it and passed out. \"Mon Dieu, qu'est ce que j'ai fait?\" Phillipe asked himself and paced around the empty house. He was in deep trouble now and he thought desperately of how to set things right. There was plenty of wood around and he pulled out a box of matches. \"Je suis désolé, mère,\" he said, placing down the gun and striking the match. He dropped it and hurried out of the house. ()()()()()()()()()()()() Angel was aroused from a deep slumber and she realized that something was wrong. She had a headache and she rubbed her eyes. Angel looked out the window and saw something flickering in the distance. \"Mok, Mok,\" she said, shaking her husband awake. \"Something's wrong, I'm going to check it out.\" Angel got into her clothes and shoes and hurried out. She went into a run, heading towards the light, but she realized it was a fire, and she hurried back to get help. In her mind, she tried to remember some French and she calls out, \"Aidez-Moi! Feu!\" Angel yelled out those words over and over, both inside the mansion and outside on the grounds. In an instant, the workers, staff, and Angel's husband came rushing out. Angel pointed to the source and they hurried. Angel was right, the abandoned house was on fire and the staff hurried to the well, taking buckets and filling them will water. With one bucket after another, the staff doused the flames, but the fire kept on raging. Angel then had the gut feeling that someone was inside the house and without thinking, she went in. \"Angel! What are you doing?!\" Mok shouted after her. The young woman battled through the heat, looking around, and she saw Cherine, out cold in her wheelchair. Angel quickly got the elderly woman on her back and she rushed out of the burning house. As soon as Angel got out, she felt an intense heat coming from behind. \"Angel!\" Mok screamed and she saw that Cherine's clothes had caught on fire! The flames consumed Cherine's shoulders and back and Angel and Mok did their best to pat out the fire. Cherine cried out in agony and at the moment, Angel grabbed a bucket of water and was able to douse the flames. \"Mon Dieu! Mère!\" Mok cried out and huddled over his mother. Cherine's shoulders and back were char black and Angel knew that she needed to get to a hospital immediately. \"We need medics! Attention médicale!\" Angel shouted at the staff. She saw Cindy and her brothers coming over. \"The fire department and the medics are coming!\" Cindy answered and held Emmy back from seeing her grandmother all burned up. \"Is there a first aid kit? Trousse de premiers soins?\" Angel asked around and Laurette arrived with it. Angel began to look for jewelry on Cherine, but there wasn't any, so Angel applied cool, moist cloths over the elderly woman. Then everyone heard the sirens and they were coming fast. From the author: Oh no! Poor Cherine! What will happen next?[Chapter 9] Chapter 8 Cherine was taken by ambulance to the burn facility in the Université Médicale de l'Hôpital in Paris where she was admitted to surgery as soon as she arrived. Mok ordered Toad to drive him, Laurette, and Phillipe to the hospital and they waited for word on their mother's condition. Back on the estate, Angel and the workers watched as the fire department put out the flames from the abandoned house. Every since she saw the fire, Angel asked herself of how the fire came to be and why Cherine was in the house and how she got there. She realized that the house was now a crime scene, but all of the evidence had either been burned or washed away. However, if she could gain the police captain's trust she might be able to enter. She found Harold and she pulled him aside. \"I need you to translate, you do speak French?\" Angel asked. \"I did say that I do,\" Harold answered, \"However, you should ask if he speaks English.\" Angel nods and they met with Captain Fabrice Voclain. \"Captain, excusez-moi,\" Angel said and the police captain looks at her. Captain Voclain was a cat humanoid with gray fur and yellow-green eyes. He looks her over, almost as if she was an escaped criminal. \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" Angel asked and Voclain gave a sneer. \"You Americans have horrible accents,\" he replied and Angel felt offended, \"Yes, I do speak English. And who are you?\" he asked. \"Angel Lyons-Swagger, my husband is Mok Swagger. His mother is-\" \"I know, I know,\" Voclain interrupted and says, \"What is it you want?\" \"This house is a crime scene, I have the feeling the fire was set deliberately, with the intention to kill Cherine Desrosiers,\" Angel said and Voclain raised an eyebrow. \"And do you know who would want to kill the Comtesse Desrosiers?\" he asked. \"No, but I know Cherine-\" Voclain held up a hand, stopping her from finishing. \"Here's what I think, the comtesse is dying from breast cancer, but she did not want to go through the pain, so she sets fire on herself just to speed up the process,\" he replied and Angel looks at him in shock and disbelief. \"What?! Captain, why would she do that?\" Angel asked, but Voclain gave a sniff. \"I did say she did not want to go through the pain,\" he replied. Angel wanted to slap him for speaking ill of Mok's mother. \"Captain, the comtesse has been looking for her son, Mok for years and they just met yesterday. Now, I know it is a long way from the main chateau to here, but the comtesse is mostly wheelchair-bound and she can't walk for long periods of time and it was around midnight when I noticed the fire,\" Angel explained. Voclain looked bored when he heard Angel's explanation. \"Listen Captain, Cherine loves her son Mok, and she would never attempt suicide, especially not at a time like this,\" Angel adds. \"From what I heard, the comtesse had made a new will and she was going to disinherit her legitimate children and give everything to Mok Swagger,\" Voclain said and Angel's hands formed into fists. \"Mok is her legitimate child,\" she said, but Voclain gave a laugh. \"Oh really? Did the comtesse every tell you about the annulment?\" he asked and Angel looked confused. \"Oh she didn't. You see, over twenty years ago when the young Cherine Beaulieu came back from Canada, her parents had her marriage to Redford Swagger be declared null and void. With that, Mok Swagger was labeled as the illegitimate child of Cherine Beaulieu,\" Voclain explained and Angel and Harold stood there in utter disbelief. \"But...I don't understand, Cherine said-\" \"She said she was married to that...how do you say it? A self-absorbed bastard? Well, why don't you ask her? Believe me, when Cherine abandoned her family, it was quite the scandal,\" Voclain said and was about to turn away. \"I'll let you poke around this place, but if you injury yourself in there, don't blame me,\" he adds and walks away. \"Egli è il bastardo egocentrico,\" Harold said in Italian and Angel knew what he said. When the police left, Angel and Harold looked around the burned out house. Cherine's wheelchair remained where it was, but the fabric had been incarcerated. \"If Cherine came out here, it would take a long time, I say maybe hours. Anyone would be able to stop her,\" Harold said and he and Angel continued to search the house. \"I think someone brought her here, to kill her,\" Angel said and she pointed to something on the floor. It was a gun, it had survived the fire, and Angel took it by her sleeve. Just then, her cell phone rang, and she answered. \"Angel, it's me, did you find a gun anywhere?\" Mok asked. \"Yes, how do you know?\" she replied. \"Mother has a bullet wound in her shoulder, it did not sever a major artery, but I believe, and I suspect you do, too, that someone wanted to kill her,\" he said and Angel heard a depressed sigh. \"I would like to see her, is she out of surgery?\" Angel asked. \"Yes, but I'm afraid she can't talk anymore, her vocal cords were damaged from the flames,\" Mok replied, but that didn't dampen Angel's spirits. \"There are other ways to communicate. I'll be there in a little bit,\" Angel said and hang up. \"Who would want to kill Cherine? She's an old lady,\" Harold said to her. \"She told me she made a new will and whoever tried to kill her wants to prevent the new will from coming to light,\" Angel replied and the two went to the hospital. ()()()()()()()()() Angel and Harold found Mok sitting beside his mother, who was covered in gauze. Angel thought she smelled the scent of burned flesh and it was a nauseating scent. Cherine looks up at Angel and tries to smile. \"I'm very sorry, if I had not been careless, you would not be in such a state,\" she said to her mother-in-law. Cherine tried to shake her head, but she could not move due to the gauze. \"60% of her body is completely burned. She is in critical condition, if she survives the first 24 hours, it will be a miracle,\" Mok said to his wife. Angel nods and looks at Cherine, \"Do you mind if I ask questions?\" she asked Cherine, \"Before I do, do you know how to communicate with your eyes? You blink once for yes and twice for no, do you understand?\" Cherine blinked once and Angel began. \"Did you go out to the house by yourself?\" Cherine blinked twice. \"Did someone take you there?\" She blinked once. \"Was it someone you know?\" Once. \"Did he or she shoot you first?\" Once. \"Was it deliberate?\" Twice. \"It was an accident?\" Cherine did not blink and Angel knew she was not sure. Then Cherine poked at Angel's pocket and she was about to reach her hand in it, but Cherine shook her head. Angel decided to check it out later and she decided to ask more questions. \"Cherine, is it true that your marriage to Redford was declared null and void after you came back to France?\" Cherine blinked once. \"An annulment?\" Mok asked and Angel told him what Captain Voclain told her. \"So, I can't inherit anything if she dies?\" he asked, but Cherine blinked twice. She poked at Angel's pocket, again, and Angel knew that whatever Cherine wrote on the piece of paper was a clue. \"Cherine, I promise you I'll find whoever is responsible for everything they have done to you and they'll be brought to justice,\" Angel assured her mother-in-law. \"I'm going back to the mansion, I'm sure whatever she had written must be somewhere on the property,\" she whispered to her husband. \"Be careful, I have a feeling that whoever tried to kill her will come after you,\" Mok replied and Angel nods. \"Mommy?\" Emmy said, \"I need to tell you something.\" \"What is it?\" Angel asked and the little girl motioned her fingers for her mother to come down to her level. Her father did too and Emmy whispers, \"Uncle Phillipe hit grandma last night.\" \"What?\" Angel asked in a horrified tone. Mok was shocked to hear that and looks at his mother. He looks her over and discovers a black and blue bruise on Cherine's left cheek. \"Why didn't you tell us earlier?\" Angel asked her daughter, but Emmy shushed her. \"Uncle Phillipe said he will kill you and daddy if I tell anyone,\" she whispered back. Angel immediately realized that Phillipe was behind everything, but her family and Cherine were in danger. However, she had to go back to the property to find some sort of evidence that would point Phillipe as the culprit. \"I have to find the will,\" she said to herself. She turned to face Toad, \"If you see Phillipe, don't let him in here and don't tell him where I have gone,\" she ordered him and he straightens up. Angel then left the hospital and went back to the Desrosiers' estate. However, she was unaware that someone was watching and following her. From the author: Let's just hope that Angel will solve this mystery and catch the culprit. Stay tuned![Chapter 10] Chapter 9 Angel returned to the palace-style chateau where she went and looked around the rooms, hoping to find one where Phillipe or anyone would not discover her. She tried not to be paranoid, but she could not help but jump at every sound in the enormous place. Of course, the halls were silent as the grave, and Angel felt at peace. Finally, she came across the library, where it was full of desks and selves of books, it was a good hiding place. Angel went in and hid behind a tall shelf and took out the slip of paper Cherine gave her. The words were in French, but Angel did her best to translate them. \"To anyone who wishes to know my secret. To find what I have kept hidden, under the floor boards of the abandoned house you will find a surprise,\" she said and that was it, except for a symbol. No, it was not a symbol, it was the letter 'M'. \"For Mok I suspect,\" Angel said to herself and saw more words. \"Quarante, seize, quatre vingt trois, deux, & soixante-dix sept,\" it read. Angel was stumped, she had never seen French words like this. Then, she realized that they were not words, they were numbers. \"Let's see, 40, 16, 83, 2, 77,\" she translated. She suspected that Cherine had a safe under the burned out house and she immediately went out of the chateau and heading towards the abandoned house. She looked around the interior of the house, but nothing looked out of the ordinary. Angel walked around, nothing seemed to appear out of sorts. She sat on the ground, it was clearly unsafe as the wood had burned away. Suddenly, Angel fell through, crashing down on dirt, but she wasn't hurt. To her surprise, she found a hidden tunnel, and she knew she getting closer. She turned on her flashlight, lighting the tunnel and headed down. ()()()()()()()()()()() After a while, Angel realized that she was nearing the end of the tunnel, and she looked around the walls, looking for the symbol. Then, something flickered in the flashlight's beam and Angel followed it until she came across the 'M' made of chrome steel. There was nothing else and Angel thought Cherine was playing a cruel joke until she decided to dig underneath the symbol. The earth was loose and Angel was able to move it to reveal a hidden safe. Angel's heart began to pound and she looked over the numbers and set the combination. Finally, the door opened and inside was a journal and a few papers. One of the paper said \"Dernière volonté et testament de Cherine Beaulieu-Desrosiers\". \"Finally,\" Angel said to herself. Then, she saw a certificate of some kind. It read \"Certificat de naissance\" and Angel saw Mok's name on it. There was the word \"Légitime\" in red stamp at the bottom. Angel realized that this was a new birth certificate for Mok and it was signed by the prime minister of Canada and the prime minister of France. She opened the journal, wondering if anything would give her a clue on the certificate. Everything was written in French and Angel decided to wait and take it to Mok and Cherine. She placed the will and the birth certificate in the inside pocket of her jacket and turned around to go back. Just then, she came face to face with Phillipe. \"Phillipe?!\" Angel exclaimed, mostly out of fear. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked, trying to keep calm. \"I was about to ask the same thing. I saw a hole in the floorboards of the house, but when I saw this tunnel I decided to look around,\" Phillipe answered, but Angel knew he followed her. \"What is that in your hand?\" Phillipe asked upon seeing the journal in her hand. \"I think it's a journal,\" Angel answered. She wished she had her gun, but she must rely on her defense skills if Phillipe were to become violent. \"It belongs to my mother, doesn't it?\" Phillipe asked, now he sounded serious. \"Her will is in it, I know it is,\" he said and Angel held onto it. \"I don't know, I didn't look in it,\" Angel replied. Phillipe held out his hand, \"Give it to me, you prove to be much help,\" he adds. Angel decided to tell him, \"It was you, you tried to kill your mother. All because of her will,\" she said. \"She was planning on disowning me and Laurette. Everything, the vineyards, the chateau, and even the company would go to Mok. He is not her legitimate child! He was born out of a marriage that didn't exist! But, she still favored him more than us!\" Phillipe shouted, angrily. \"How do you even know? Cherine might not have disowned you, she was probably trying to tell you that, but you shot her and tried to burn her!\" Angel replied, but Phillipe shook his head. \"It was an accident!\" he shouted, \"I tried to get her to talk, but the gun went off in my hand.\" \"You didn't kill her, but you tried to when you set the house on fire!\" Angel informed him. \"No, no, no, I didn't mean it!\" Phillipe replied, he was pressing his hands against his ears. \"Why didn't you go for help if you set it off by accident?\" Angel asked as she was curious. \"I thought she was dead and I would go to prison! They would not believe it was an accident!\" Phillipe was shouting in a loud voice. \"Calm down Phillipe, it's okay, just tell the police the truth,\" Angel said, but Phillipe looks at her in surprise. \"You've met Captain Voclain? He never listens, he always jumps to his own conclusions and arrests anyone without listening to their side of the story,\" Phillipe replied. \"Phillipe, any court of law always hears both sides of the story,\" Angel tried to calm him. \"Not here in France, I had a friend who went to prison for \"attacking\" a neighbor's dog. He tried to tell the court that he tried to defend himself as the dog was attacking him, but they threw that statement and he served a year in prison,\" Phillipe explained to Angel. Angel knew that it would not be easy to try to explain to the court about Phillipe's side of the story. Any court of law would be corrupt with rogue police officials and judges, but she had to try. \"Phillipe, I will help you in explaining your side of the story,\" Angel said, but Phillipe bitterly angry. \"I already told you, no one will listen,\" he replied and reached out to her with his hands. \"Stop!\" someone shouted from behind and they saw Laurette and she was holding a gun up to Phillipe. \"Laurette, what are you doing?\" Phillipe asked his sister. \"Preventing you from doing something you will regret later,\" Laurette replied in fluent English, her accent was still noticeable. \"You speak English?\" her brother asked again. \"Yes, it took me years of practicing, but I did not want you to think I understood English because I knew what you were up to,\" Laurette said. Phillipe looks at her with wide eyes and Laurette explains, \"Mother told me about Mok when I was little, long before she told you. She even told me of the life she went through with Redford Swagger and of her sacrifice to save her son. \"She showed me the scars and the x-rays she brought from Canada, she said it was hell living with Redford, but she did not want to take Mok and live on the streets. When Mok killed Redford, she decided right then that she would throw the police off his trail long enough for him to get across the broader. \"When she also escaped from Canada, she knew that she would never see her son again as she had not enough money to set up a search for him. She came home to France, but her life of hell was not over. \"Her parents took her to court and had both the Canadian and French governments declare her marriage to Redford Swagger null and void and label Mok as illegitimate, therefore he would not be able to inherit anything if she dies,\" Laurette explained and continues. \"However, mother refused to accept that Mok was illegitimate and had a word with her father. She demanded that Mok be declared her legitimate son, but he refused. She kept on begging him for almost a year until he finally gave in, but there was a catch. Her father said he will have the governments declare the legitimacy of Mok once Cherine paid off her debt of 400,000 francs as it was the amount that her mother sent for her marriage to Redford, but she had to keep that a secret.\" \"400,000 francs?\" Angel asked in astonishment. \"It was quite a lot, but Cherine did not let that dampen her, so she went to find work here at the Desrosiers Vineyards. It was hard at first, but she managed to pull through. She get up early in the morning and set out to do her duties. Our father, the Comte Constantin Desrosiers took notice of her and admired her work and he approached her.\" \"They would get together whenever they can and mother finally had the courage to tell her story and the reason she was at Desrosiers Vineyards. He realized that she loved her son more than anything and wanted to help her in any way he could. \"He actually went to the French court and brought up the illegitimacy issue on Mok. He demanded that they declare him legitimate otherwise he will tell the whole country of their corruptness. They said they will once Cherine paid off her debt to her father. \"After a while, both Constantin and Cherine realized the best way to pay it all off was to get married and have Constantin give a dowry to her parents. They did love each other and Cherine was grateful for what Constantin did for her,\" Laurette explained to her brother and Angel. \"However, there was the issue of finding Mok. She wanted to go to one of his concerts while he was on tour in Europe, but his girlfriend got real sick and he cancelled after his one concert in Paris. Mother told me that that was real love, setting aside the things you do in order to be with someone you love. \"Eighteen years later, mother heard that his mansion in Ohmtown caught fire, but the news gave the false info of him being dead. That devastated her, but she refused to believe it, so she hired private investigators to find him,\" Laurette said and Phillipe held up a hand. \"That was the time she told me of Mok,\" he said, bitterly. \"And she knew you would not take it lightly,\" Laurette replied and she looks at Angel, \"Now you know everything about Cherine's sacrifice and her determination to find her son.\" \"I AM HER SON!\" Phillipe shouted and charged at Laurette. He clamped his hands around her throat and began to chock her. \"Stop it!\" Angel screamed and looped an arm around Phillipe's neck. She pulled him off of Laurette and he let go of her throat. Laurette coughed for breath and Angel struggled to control Phillipe. \"Lâchez-moi, salope!\" he shouted, but she refused to let go. Suddenly, there was a loud BANG! The three of them stopped moving and turned around to see Captain Volcain and a few of his men with Harold. \"Attrape le,\" Volcain ordered, pointing to Phillipe and two officers took him and handcuffed him. \"Phillipe Desrosiers, you're under arrest for the attempted murder of the Comtesse Desrosiers,\" Volcain said and Phillipe was taken away. \"Wait, Captain Volcain, it wasn't his fault,\" Angel said and Volcain looks at her. \"The cometesse admitted her son shot her and set the house on fire, if she died that would be first-degree murder,\" he replied. \"Sir, he didn't mean to shoot his mother,\" Angel said, but Volcain shakes his head. Angel had to think and she adds, \"Do you want the world to know of how corrupt you are?\" Volcain stopped in his tracks and looks at her. \"Corruption? Is this a joke?\" he asked. \"It seems to me that this country is a victim of corruption of justice, starting with this family. The justice court slapped Cherine and she had to pay off her debt with her father. The Comte Constantin Desrosiers did threaten the court about its corruption, but they were able to keep him quiet. \"However, Phillipe told me that you present your side of the story every time and not letting the victim share their side. I have the feeling that you will seek the death penalty for Phillipe,\" Angel explained, but Volcain just chuckles. \"I have no idea where you get all this, but trust me it isn't true,\" he said. Angel, however, opened the journal to reveal a page that Cherine wrote. In it was a receipt of the 400,000 francs that Cherine was due to pay off. Then, there was something else that fell out of the journal. It was a newspaper clipping and Angel took it. It was in French, but Angel was able to make out the photo of a young Volcain and the main headline of Volcain's shady business. Volcain was caught stealing wine from the Desrosiers vineyards, but he was acquitted due to bribbing the French court with the wine he stole. The Desrosiers family could not touch Volcain as he was protected by some of the judges at court. From there, Volcain won every court case and incarcerated innocent victims at his pleasure. A few of the victims who were released after serving their sentences came forward with the accusations. Angel looks at Volcain with an expression of anger and shock. Volcain, however, gave a grin. \"You?\" Laurette asked the police captain. \"You caught me,\" Volcain replied and turns to face his officers. \"Arrest them,\" he said, pointing to Angel and Laurette. The officers, however, did not move. Instead, they uncuffed Phillipe and reached for Volcain. \"Qu'est-ce que c'est?\" he asked, but the officers handcuffed him. \"Fabrice Volcain, you're under arrest for corruption of justice,\" one of them said in a familiar voice. Angel looks at him and the officer removes his hat to reveal himself as Davey Biggins. \"Davey!\" she exclaimed and she hugs him. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked him. \"After you left, I did my own research on Cherine and of her second husband, the Comte Desrosiers. Well, Volcain as you now know began to steal the Desrosiers' wine after it received universal acclaim and many awards. It is a sensation to the tongue and other senses, it also makes people desperate for more, even thieves want it. \"When Volcain was caught, he bribed the French court for his release with the wine he stole. For a while, he provided the judges his stolen stash of the wine until Phillipe Desrosiers formed his own police force to keep him off the property. As you might imagine, Volcain made a lot of money and unlimited protection. \"The Canadian government got wind of the shady business and threatened to expose the French officials, so they they informed Volcain to stop stealing the wine and keep everything a secret. Of course, Volcain waited for an opportunity for Phillipe to be disposed of and return to being a thief,\" Davey explained and adds more. \"With the continuous string of thefts, it meant a loss of money with sales and the Comte and Comtesse paid out of their own pockets to cover the debts and pay the vineyard workers. So, with that...\" Angel held up a hand and says, \"The inheritance for Cherine's children dwindled every time a theft happened.\" Davey nods and they turn to face Phillipe, he looked guilty. \"I thought my mother would push me and Laurette out of her legacy entirely in favor of Mok as she barely had any money left for the three of us,\" he said. Angel placed a hand on his shoulder, \"That may not be true, Volcain will pay for his crimes and you'll get the money,\" she replied. \"It's not the money I want, I'm just afraid of losing the vineyards. I feared that mother would sell them to cover her debts, including the chateau as they have been in our family for many generations,\" Phillipe added and Angel nods. Just then, Harold calls out, \"Angel are you down there?\" \"Harold, what is the matter?\" she called back. \"The hospital called, Cherine's condition is deteriorating, they think she might pass in an hour or so,\" he said and Laurette and Phillipe gasped in shock. \"C'mon, we better get going,\" Davey said and they hurried out of the tunnel and were driven to the hospital. From the author: Sorry if this is too confusing, I tried to make it exciting.[Chapter 11] Chapter 10 The group arrived at the hospital where they located Cherine's room. Angel entered in with Phillipe and Mok looks at him with anger in his eyes. \"Don't come any closer,\" he ordered his half-brother, preventing him from seeing Cherine. \"She is our mother, I want to apologize for what-\" \"Apologize?! Now you want to apologize for trying to kill her?!\" Mok bellowed at him. \"Mok, it was an accident,\" Angel said and her husband looks at her in surprise. \"You're siding with him?!\" Mok shouted at her, \"I don't believe this!\" Angel showed him Cherine's journal and he looks at it, \"What is this?\" he asked, bitterly. \"Just read it, start at the beginning,\" she replied and Mok opens the journal. It took him several minutes to read the whole journal and when he was done, he noticed the birth certificate. Cherine looks at her son and he stares back while looking at the certificate. \"You...you sacrificed your time and your life for me?\" he asked and Cherine takes his hand. \"I wanted you...\" she started to say weakly, \"I wanted you to have...financial security and let the world...know that I love you more than life itself,\" she finishes and Mok begins to tear up. \"You are my...son...\" Cherine looks at her other two children, \"You have to take...care of each other...you don't need the vineyards. It is just...grape vines and everything else...I really didn't care for those...medals and honors. The chateau is...just a...place. You are...free to go...wherever you want...\" she said, her voice was weak and cracking. Phillipe went down on his knees and began to sob, \"I didn't mean to hurt you. I thought you were going to push me out of the family entirely and I would be forced to live on the streets,\" he said to his mother. Cherine placed a hand on her Phillipe's head and replies, \"Why...would I...abandon...my own...children...?\" She looks at Angel and says, \"You...brought back...Mok...to his...former self...I am...eternally...grateful...You saved...his life...and you...saved mine...\" \"Cherine,\" Angel cried and the dying woman takes her children's hands into hers. After a moment, Cherine exhaled her last breath and died. The heart monitor screamed, but Laurette shut it off before it alerted any doctors. Mok drops his head down beside his mother's body and all of the sadness came out in tears. Angel came up from behind him and held her husband. \"Let it all out,\" she said to him and rubs his shoulders. From the author: So sorry for not updating! Poor Mok! At least, Cherine is out of her misery.[Chapter 12] Chapter 11 Cherine's funeral commenced two days after she died. It was decided that Phillipe join the funeral and then be judged by the Justice System. Cherine had wanted to be cremated and have her ashes spread across her vineyards. The funeral took place at a little chapel on the property and it was a sweet, little funeral. Afterward, Cherine's body was taken to the cremator and her ashes were placed in a decorative urn. Both Phillipe and Laurette agreed that Mok do the honors of spreading their mother's ashes all across the vineyards. He, Angel, and Emmy walked all across the property, releasing handfuls of Cherine's ashes. Evening arrived, it had been a long day, and the funeral after party was awfully quiet. However, one of Cherine's lawyers arrived to talk of the will she left behind. In the study, Mok, Phillipe, and Laurette took seats in front of the lawyer and he opens up the will. He begins to speak, \"From the last will and testament of the Comtesse Cherine Desrosiers: I, the Comtesse Cherine Desrosiers, hereby divide my estate to my surviving children. \"For my daughter Laurette, she is to receive 30% of my estate. \"For my son Phillipe, he is to receive 30% of my estate. \"For my son Mok, he is to receive 50% of my estate,\" the lawyer takes a breath and pulls out a letter from his briefcase. \"Oh, before I forget, Mr. Harold, this is for you, a gift from the comtesse,\" he said and hands over what appeared to be a booklet. It looked like a passport with Harold's imagine in it. There were a few sentences in French and Italian, but Angel sees delight in her friend's face. \"What is it?\" she asks. \"It is a boarder pass, I can go to any country in Europe without any hassel from police,\" Harold replies and Angel congratulates him. \"I can now go to Italy, or maybe Belgium, or wherever I want. Mok, your mother is...was the greatest woman I ever met,\" Harold adds. Mok chuckles and hand-shakes him, but then shares a hug. The lawyer holds up the letter, \"This is from your mother, she wrote this before her passing,\" he said and begins to read it. \"To my children, through the years, I have thought hard of finding my son Mok. It does not mean that I love him more than Phillipe and Laurette. I love the three of you equally. \"I do want to say that the vineyards are not that important to me, it is just a place. However, you are welcome to continue operating them, or sell them and the chateau. It is entirely up to you. \"What you really need is each other. You must look out for one another, love each other as siblings. That is what I truly desire,\" the lawyer finishes the letter and puts it down. Mok, Laurette, and Phillipe look at each other. Phillipe looks down at the floor and says, \"Well, it's really up to the two of you. I'm going to jail, so I will have no say in what you will do.\" \"No,\" Mok said, \"I disagree, you do have a say. This is where our mother spent her days, so I say we keep this place going, but I will not be part of the operations here. I believe Laurette has the achievement to do so.\" After much discussion, the three of them agreed that Laurette be the active head of the Desrosiers Vineyards' operations. Shortly afterward, Phillipe faced judgement for his crimes. The justice system allowed him to speak of his side of the story. There was also the mention of Volcan's shady business and Phillipe's anger toward him. The French justice system debated for one day and came back with their decision. Angel and Mok listen and held their breath, wondering what punishment Phillipe will face. \"Phillipe Desrosiers, this body of judges finds you guilty of attempted murder. However, seeing that you are remorseful of your actions, this body of judges has decided to sentence you to ten years in prison, following three years of probation, but if you behave well during your prison sentence, we will see if you are fit to have your sentences reduced. Your inheritance will be held until your release,\" the head judge explains to everyone in the court in English. There was excitement in the court room. Mok and Laurette embraced Phillipe before he was taken away. \"Ten years, it will go by in a flash. Angel, thank you for everything,\" Phillipe said to her. He looks at Mok, \"And thank you, mon frere,\" he adds and he was taken by the officers. The next day, the Swagger family were prepared to leave the vineyards and stay in Paris for a few days. Harold also joined them for Paris. They promised to return to the vineyards before returning to Canada to bid goodbye to Laurette. They stayed in a luxurious hotel that had a view of the Eiffel Tower and Mok and Angel explored the night life of Paris. \"I can't believe that we are here,\" Angel said to Mok, \"Paris, the City of Lights.\" Mok pulls her in for a kiss and they watch the Eiffel Tower's spotlights play in the dark night. They returned to their hotel room, where they made love and in the morning, they took Emmy around the city. Just a few days later, Harold packed what he needed, including his violin and the Swagger family and their employees bid him farewell at the train station. \"Send us postcards!\" Emmy demands before giving him a goodbye hug. \"I promise,\" he replies and he gives one last goodbye before getting in the train car. The train then left the station, heading east towards Belgium, where Harold would begin his European journey. \"Can I do a train ride through Europe?\" Emmy asks her parents. \"When you are older,\" Angel replies and the family headed back to the vineyards as they were ready to head home. At the vineyards, Laurette was there to bid them farewell. \"You are more than welcome to come back any time,\" she said and hugs her brother, Mok. She then gives them a crate full of the Desrosiers' wine. \"Thank you,\" Angel said and hugs Laurette. Emmy gives her aunt a hug and a kiss goodbye and the family heads to the airport, where their private jet was waiting. The jet then heads out and the Swagger family stare the windows, looking at the skyline of Paris for one last time. From the author: After a six-month absence with this story, I decided to finish this up, so I am back in the game! Last thing to do is an epilogue, so stick around.[Chapter 13] Epilogue Angel returned to work with Captain Davey, who wanted to see her. \"Since you handled this case quite well, I wanted to ask you if you wish to become Sergeant Investigator,\" he said to her in his office. Angel was surprised at this, a sergeant investigator, which would mean getting her own team, instead of being overlooked by Davey. \"I have to warn you though, since we're short-staffed, your team will consist of two people,\" Davey replies and Angel nods. \"Do I get to choose?\" she asks and Davey nods. He then pulls out a folder that was full of papers. They were background infos on the available candidates. \"Take all the time you need, but I would like for you to choose by next week,\" Davey informs her and she nods, again. All day, Angel looks through the background infos and had to take them home in order to look them over. She told Mok about the promotion. \"A sergeant?! You're getting closer to superintendent,\" he exclaims. They celebrated that night, but Angel was tired and felt out of sorts. When they got back from France, she did feel fatigued. Since she and Mok made love in Paris, Angel thought of the possibility of being pregnant, but she had not had any more symptoms. By the next day, she asked Cindy to get her a pregnancy test. \"Oh, expecting another rascal?\" she asks. \"I just want to be sure, that's all,\" Angel replies and Cindy nods. Angel went to work, juggling with deciding with who to choose, but then, she felt nausea and hurries to the restroom. She throws up in the toilet and the other women look at her with concern. \"I know that sign from anywhere,\" a voice said when Angel was washing out her mouth at the sink. Angel looks to see a cat-like woman about her age. She had green-yellow eyes and red hair. \"Name's Michelle Francis,\" she introduces herself. \"I'm Angel Swagger,\" Angel replies. \"Yeah, I know who you are, solved that case in France. By the way, when did you have intercourse?\" Michelle asks and Angel blushes. \"About two weeks ago,\" she replies and Michelle pats her shoulder. \"The second time usually comes earlier than the first, don't believe me? Take the test when you get home,\" she said and leaves. Angel returns to her desk and discovers Michelle's info among the papers. She was a single mother from Banff, Alberta with two children and she was hired last year. Michelle did have good marks in chemistry, which made her the best chemist in the police department. Michelle was hoping to get out to the field and Angel knew she would be a good candidate. Just then, a man with rat features arrived with a bag of mangoes. \"One of the best foods to eat during pregnancy. My wife had a craving for these when she was pregnant with twins,\" he said. He had black hair with black eyes. He was dressed in typical clothes, which was appropriate for being out in the field. \"I'm sorry who are you?\" Angel asks. \"Hold on, where are my manners?\" he replies and walks backwards and then walks forward to Angel. \"The name's Jim, Jim Gosse. Kind of sounds like 'get lost',\" he said and chuckles, \"But seriously, don't run away from me. Call me the class clown or the crazy guy. I am the blood splatter analyst and trust me, I take my job seriously.\" \"Um, thank you for the mangoes Jim,\" Angel said and Jim scurries like a cartoon character. Angel realized that she liked Jim and she picked him as the second candidate. She picks up the photos of Michelle and Jim and went to Davey's office. She slams the photos down on his desk. \"I want them on my team,\" Angel demands and waits for his reply. \"Whoa, what's the hurry?\" Davey asks, but Angel stares at him. \"If you say so,\" he adds and calls Jim and Michelle in. \"Seems that Mrs. Swagger has taken a liking to you two,\" Davey said to them. He explains that Angel was now their sergeant and she will be supervising them in the field. \"This is...great!\" Jim exclaims, cheerfully. Michelle looks at Jim with annoyance, but then smiles. Angel shakes hands with Jim and Michelle and Captain Davey congratulates them. \"I'm sure I'll have a case for you tomorrow morning,\" he said to them. \"You should tell your husband of your...you know,\" Michelle said and Angel nods. \"But I surprise him,\" Michelle adds. Angel decided to leave early to go home and surprise Mok and Emmy. She decided to surprise them with a gift of a baby onesie, yet she was not sure what the gender was, so she decided to get a neutral one. She did find a nice yellow onesie that had the engraving of the Eiffel Tower and with the words \"Paris baby\". Angel returns home and discovers the dining room decorated with a banner that said \"Congratulations!\" Then everyone comes out to surprise Angel and Mok hugs and kisses her. \"So is it true?\" Cindy asks Angel. \"About what?\" Mok asks in return. Angel takes in a deep breath and reveals the baby onesie. The whole room erupted into cheers and Mok hugs and kisses Angel even more. \"This day has gotten better and better!\" Cindy shrieks and pulls out some non-alcoholic cider. The party lasted for the entire evening and the non-alcoholic cider was gone and also the apple juice that Angel suddenly had a craving for. \"Mommy, you drank it all!\" Emmy fussed. \"Sorry,\" Angel replied and wrote it down on the list of things she craved for. She then remembered the mangoes Jim offered her and had one. It was juicy and good. Angel then felt tired and decided to go to bed. \"Oh Angel,\" her husband said, \"This came today.\" He gives her a postcard from Brussels and she begins to read. To the Swagger Family, Just to let you know that I made it to Belgium just fine. The train ride was quiet, so I played my violin and I became a hit with the passengers. Brussels is a wonderful European city and I plan on staying until I've seen everything in the country. I am planning on going to the Netherlands for the winter. I always wanted to see Europe during winter. Hope all is well and I will get back to you soon. ~Harold Angel felt a smile crease over her mouth as she was happy for her friend who was enjoying the sites of Europe. She lies down on the couch, gazing out to watch the sun set over the ocean. Mok joins her. \"What are you thinking about?\" he asks. \"Just the fact that I got to see Europe for the first time. We need to go back, like soon,\" she replies and he chuckles. \"I know, I know,\" Mok said, \"Come to think of it, I have not been to...\" he begins to think, \"Monaco, Estonia, Slovakia, all those little countries,\" he answers and sits down beside Angel. \"But for now, let's enjoy the essence of home,\" he adds and Angel nods and lays her head down on his chest. FIN From the author: Finally! It's done! Took me long enough with this one! Hope you've enjoyed it!

Original characters belong to me. This story is an inspiration of Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws'. Prologue On a dark stretch of beach, a group of teenagers surrounded a bon fire. One played an electric guitar, but he created a lot of noise instead of music. The others had been drinking and they were at the point of being very drunk. One dog humanoid teen girl walked up to a tipsy cat boy. \"Hey!\" she called over the noise. \"Hey yourself!\" he replied, struggling to get his footing. \"What's your name?\" he asked. \"Jean,\" she answered and pulled him to his feet and they ran off towards the dark water. \"Where are we going?!\" the cat boy asked. \"Swimming!\" Jean answered and then started shedding her clothes and undergarments. The cat boy struggled to get his pants off and he collapsed to the ground. \"I'll catch up, I think I'm drunk!\" he called out to Jean, who had entered the water. Jean swam out and then turned her head towards the beach. She could not see the cat boy as it was dark. She failed to notice the bubbles emerging from the water and bursting on the surface. Whatever creature was under Jean, it swam towards her, and took hold of her foot. It tugged on her, but she laughed it off. \"Very funny, whoever you are,\" Jean said, but then, the figure pulled her beneath the surface. Jean could not see the person in the black water, but something made a cut through her leg and her mouth released bubbles. She swam up to the surface and broke through. \"Help! Somebody!\" Jean cried out, but the assailant pulled her under, again. She felt a stinging sensation hit her shoulders and then her belly. Whoever the assailant was, he must be stabbing her, and she panicked. Unfortunately, the killer blow came to her chest as the knife cut through her skin and then her heart. Jean's body floated for a moment and then the current took her away towards the shore. The killer placed the knife back in its holster. He breathed in through the mouthpiece that attached to the oxygen tank he had on his back. He released some bubbles from his mouth and, satisfied in what he did, he swam away.[Chapter 2] Chapter 1 The town of Mystic Rock Harbor in British Columbia awoke to a brilliant dawn. The clouds were painted purple and pink and the ocean released a salt-scented spray. In the Swagger house, Angel and her husband, Mok were still asleep in their beds. They did not witness the sun rise, as they usually never do. Angel was a detective forensic employed by the town's police station. Usually, she led cases that involved robbery and vandalism, but there was not a single case of homicide. The town of Mystic Rock Harbor, unlike its neighbor to the south, Vancouver, it never had a case of murder for over 60 years. There were times that Angel felt that it was for the best to not cause a panic in the town. However, she was bored of doing the same, solving a robbery or a vandal case. \"Mommy! Mommy!\" a little voice exclaimed. Angel's daughter, Emmy climbed up onto her mother and began to rough bounce on her. \"Emmy, that hurts, what is it?\" Angel asked and the girl stopped bouncing. \"Phone call, mommy!\" Emmy said, happily. Angel groaned, she knew that her boss was on the phone, perhaps to tell her that there is another case of a robbery waiting to be solved. \"C'mon mommy!\" Emmy cried, pulling on her mother's arm. \"Now, now Emmy, don't boss your mother around,\" Mok said to his daughter, \"She has a very tough job.\" \"Not as tough as I wanted it to be,\" Angel replied and got up from the bed. The blonde woman went up to M.A.I., the computer that served as a tele-communicator. \"Yes?\" Angel asked. \"Detective Lyons?\" Captain Davey Biggins asked, \"You better get down to Tranquility Beach right now.\" \"Tranquility Beach? What's going on?\" Angel asked. \"You know that this town has a record of not having a homicide in 60 years?\" Biggins said, \"Well, it looks like we have to start re-counting.\" Angel knew what that meant; there was a body at the beach, a possible homicide. \"I'll be there in between 10 to 15 minutes,\" Angel said and turned off the phone. She changed out of her night clothes and into her black pants, black shirt, and red jacket. She gathered her forensics kit and looped her gun belt around her belly. \"Angel?\" Mok asked. \"Why are you so excited?\" \"There's a body at Tranquility Beach, it could be a homicide,\" Angel replied and she got into her police cruiser. \"Real quick, Minnie and Nicolai will be coming around noon today and Emmy wants to go to the beach,\" Mok said to his wife. \"I'll be back before then, don't go without me,\" Angel replied and she headed out towards the crime scene.[Chapter 3] Chapter 2 Angel arrived at Tranquility Beach, where dozens of police cars were in the parking lot. She got out of her cruiser and met with Captain Biggins. \"Victim is over there,\" he pointed out and Angel walked out onto the open beach. She found the female victim lying on her back and she was being examined by the coroner, Hannah Gideon. Hannah Gideon had been the town's coroner for ten years, but usually she dealt with bodies from the hospital, and she had yet to find a homicide victim. Hannah went to forensics school in Vancouver and became the city's coroner for a short time before being transferred to Mystic Rock Harbor. She became Angel's good friend when Angel was hired three years ago. Hannah was a dog humanoid with dark brown hair, tan skin, and chocolate brown eyes. \"Who found her?\" Angel asked, as she put on gloves. \"A jogger spotted her in the surf. At first, he thought it was some trash, but curiosity got the best of him and he pulled her in and called us,\" Dr. Gideon replied. The dog girl was naked, but her belly and chest was riddled with stab wounds. \"Was she stabbed on land before being tossed in the water?\" Angel asked. \"Not sure, I'll know more when we take her back, but this is a homicide,\" Dr. Gideon said and her assistants came with a gurney and a body bag. Angel looked out on the beach and the ocean. There were a lot of questions swarming in her head. \"Detective Lyons?\" Captain Biggins said to her and she went back to reality. \"There's a young man here, he said he knew the victim, sort of.\" \"Whatever information he has, it could be useful,\" Angel replied and she walked up to the cat humanoid. \"What's your name?\" Angel asked him. \"Fred or Freddy, whatever you like to call me,\" the cat boy replied. \"You said that you knew the victim, what can you tell me?\" she asked, again. \"I was at a bonfire party last night, tons of people. Jean was her name,\" Fred answered. \"She and I, well, hit it off, and she wanted to go swimming,\" he added. \"Swimming?\" Angel asked. \"Yeah, I was going to go in, but I guess I passed out before I went into the water,\" Fred replied. \"I had too much to drink,\" he added in a whisper. \"You didn't see anything unusual when Jean went into the water?\" Angel asked. \"No, it was dark, very dark,\" Fred replied and Angel felt a bit disappointed. She allowed the cat boy to leave and turns to an officer, \"Did anyone recover the victim's personal belongings?\" she asked. \"We recovered her clothes a little further down along with her drivers' license,\" the officer answered and Angel looked at the license. The girl's name was 'Jean Coppin' and she was from the city of Prince Rupert. Angel decided to leave and head to the police station to report the incident. The Mystic Rock Harbor PD was a small station with little staff as the town was not like Vancouver or any other big city. Angel went to her desk and booted up her computer. She opened up a file that allowed her to report any crime or incident. She typed in the victim's first name 'Jean' and 'Coppin' for the last name. Angel put in 'Tranquility Beach' for the location where the victim was found. She looked at the slot where it said 'Cause of Death'. She was about to type in, when a voice says, \"Mrs. Swagger!\" Angel turned around to see the mayor, Vincent 'Vinny' Giroux with some of his staff and Dr. Gideon was with him, too. \"Mayor Giroux, good morning,\" Angel replied. \"Listen, I understand that a body was found at Tranquility Beach and Dr. Gideon said it is a homicide, do you think so?\" the mayor asked. \"From the stab wounds I saw—\" \"Whoa, whoa, stab wounds?\" Mayor Giroux interrupted, \"Well, I saw the body and I happen to know that they are propeller blade wounds,\" he said. \"Excuse me?\" Angel asked. \"Listen, my staff and I believe that this poor girl went out too far and was hit by a passing boat,\" the mayor replied. \"You mean you think it was an accident? Dr. Gideon said—\" \"I made a mistake, Angel,\" Hannah cut in, \"I agree with the mayor, the wounds were consistent with a boat's propeller blades.\" Angel did not know what to say; she obviously disagreed with the mayor's theory. \"Listen, Mrs. Swagger,\" Mayor Giroux said to Angel, \"The town is in preparation for Canada Day. This is the one day of the year where people from around the world come to our town and enjoy our beaches. \"Now, if you say there is…I don't know, a serial killer on the loose, then the tourists will go ballistic and pack up and leave. Now, the town's businesses rely on tourist dollars, when the money does not come, then how will the people get by with no heat or food when winter comes?\" Mayor Giroux asked. Angel took this as a warning; she did not want to be made the town's enemy, but she feared that there was a killer out there, targeting swimmers. Angel nodded at the mayor and says, \"Alright sir, I agree with you, the victim died from a boating accident.\" \"Very good,\" Mayor Giroux replied and he and his staff leave. Angel looks at Hannah and asks, \"Did he bully you into saying something else?\" \"Angel, not now,\" Dr. Gideon replied and turned away. \"No, I'm serious; he did bully you into changing your mind. You said you dealt with homicide victims in Vancouver and you saw victims like Jean,\" Angel said to her friend. \"Yeah, but I was the coroner in the Vancouver morgue for a short time, so I didn't see much stabbing victims,\" Hannah replied and leaves. Angel was sure that the mayor pressured Hannah into saying something else other than homicide on her report. She turned back to her report and types in 'Boating Accident' in the Cause of Death slot. Angel then looks at her clock; it was getting close to noon. She finished up her report and packed up her things and headed on home.[Chapter 4] Chapter 3 The Fire Sand Beach was full of locals and tourists. Dog, cat, and rat humanoids crowded on the shore and in the water. The sun was beaming down on them and it was getting hot, making the people go into the water. Under a blue cloth canopy, Angel watched with unease as she was unable to remove the images of Jean's body from her mind. She knew that the mayor was wrong; the girl did not die from a boat's propeller. Angel was sure that someone stabbed the poor girl, perhaps when she was out in the water last night. Minnie Lenzo played with Emmy in creating sand barriers while Nicholai had his toes touch the water. Toad was on guard, looking out for his employer for any trouble. Then, someone came up to the canopy, asking for Angel. The woman looked up and saw the mayor's aid, Mr. George McMillian. \"Mrs. Swagger, I just want to say that the mayor was right about the poor girl, Jean Coppin,\" he said, but Angel looked over his shoulder. A young woman in the water cried out, causing Angel to jump up, but was relieved when a man hoisted the woman onto his shoulders. Mr. McMillian did not stop talking, but Angel did not hear his words and her husband, Mok seemed to notice. \"Mr. McMillian,\" the retired rock star said to the mayor's aid, \"I'm afraid I'm going to ask you to leave.\" Mr. McMillian left and Mok went behind Angel's back and began to massage her shoulders. \"Don't pay any attention to him, all that matters is what you believe,\" he said to her and Angel nods. \"And the mayor is wrong, too,\" Mok adds, \"If there really is a serial killer and he keeps the beaches open, a lot of people are going to bang down his door one night.\" Elsewhere, a young rat boy humanoid with an inflatable raft went on the water. \"Rex, don't go too far!\" his mother shouted after him. Under the water, unbeknownst to everyone, someone was swimming under their feet, looking for prey. Rex had ventured out far from the shore and was out in the open. It was perfect for the unseen predator and he swam up to the rat boy. In a flash, something pierced through Rex's raft and the rat boy fell off. The killer pulled on the boy's foot, but let it go for a moment. \"Help! Somebody!\" Rex cried out and he was pulled under, again. Angel spotted the rat boy and so did everyone else. The killer then plunged his knife into the boy's back, drawing blood and he stabbed the young rat humanoid, again and again. The water was now dyed with crimson red and people began to panic. \"Get everyone out!\" Angel ordered, taking her daughter into her arms. Everyone was able to get out of the water, except for Rex. The killer, seeing that his work was finished, pushed the boy's body to the surface and he swam away. \"Look!\" someone shouted, pointing to something in the water. A few volunteers went in to retrieve whatever it was and pulled it to shore. \"Oh my God!\" someone cried out when the young rat humanoid was brought to the shore, \"This boy's dead!\" \"Rex?!\" a woman called out and she went into the circle. What happened next was indescribable to any mother. Rex's mother released an anguished scream when she saw her son's body. \"Don't look Emmy,\" Angel said to her daughter and looks out on the ocean. She knew that the whole community of Mystic Rock Harbor knew that there was a serial killer on the loose.[Chapter 5] Chapter 4 The town's hall was packed with the council and confused spectators. The mother of the rat boy, Mrs. Tamara Gagné had posted a wanted sign for the person who murdered her son. She was offering one million in Canadian dollars as a reward. \"We don't know if it was person or a marine mammal,\" one of the council women said to the people. Angel, Mok, and Cindy were there and they could tell that the panic was settling in. Then, Angel's cell went off, it was Hannah Gideon. \"Yes?\" Angel answered. \"Angel, you were right, the mayor did bully me into changing my report. Jean Coppin died from a stab to the heart. She was stabbed all over, but the real blow was to her heart and the shock and the sea water caused her to bleed to death,\" the coroner said. \"What about the boy?\" Angel asked. \"Same thing. Angel, I don't know how the town's council is going to react to this, especially the mayor. I have a feeling that he's going to laugh this off and say some sort of lie,\" Dr. Gideon replied and they hung up. Angel noticed that everyone in the hall was staring at her. \"I just spoke to the coroner, Dr. Hannah Gideon,\" she said to the crowd. \"What did she say?\" someone asked. \"Rex Gagné was stabbed by a sharp object, possibly a knife, to the heart and he bled to death,\" Angel answered and the whole hall erupted into shock replies. \"We need to close the beaches!\" someone shouted. \"We need to set up a hunting party to find the bastard!\" another person called out. Suddenly, someone blew into a whistle and everyone hushed and saw the mayor, Vinny Giroux. \"Now let's think this through; Canada Day is almost here and closing the beaches would a terrible idea. We need the tourist dollars to help us—\" \"Who gives a damn about the money?! People's lives are at stake as long as that killer is out in the ocean!\" Cindy cut in and everyone gave their agreements. \"Mrs. Swagger,\" someone said to Angel, \"What do you suggest?\" Angel began to think and replies, \"Close the beaches until the killer is caught.\" \"Whoa! Whoa! Until the killer is caught?!\" Mayor Giroux shouted and adds, \"Now that will take months!\" \"Mayor, it is best for the people and since the town's PD is short staffed, yes it will take months,\" Angel replied, but the mayor shook his head. \"I suggest that the beaches remain closed until Canada Day, whether or not the killer is caught,\" Giroux said, but the people began to shout their disputes. \"Mayor,\" Mok stepped forward and everyone looks at him, \"Angel, mind if I tell them?\" he asked his wife and she nods. \"Rex Gagné is not the only victim. A young woman by the name of Jean Coppin was discovered at Tranquility Beach this morning. She was murdered the same way as the young Gagné,\" Mok tells the crowd and everyone gasped. Mok continues, \"Now, I have a feeling that this killer may be deranged in the mind as he attacked two young people with no mercy. Which is why I am suggesting to my wife that she call the nearest psychiatric hospital and bring a psychologist to see the victims and see what he or she says.\" The people looked at one another and they began to nod in agreement. \"I agree with Mr. Swagger,\" a council man replied. \"Mayor Giroux, what do you say?\" Mr. Higgins asked his employer. The mayor looked irritated and answers, \"All right, call whoever is willing to come. I will also allow a hunting party to form and search for the killer out in the water. As for the beaches, they are to be closed until Canada Day.\" The people gave angry responses, demanding that the mayor extend the closure beyond the holiday. \"I've made my decision and it is final!\" the mayor shouted and leaves. \"I really hate that man,\" Cindy said as she and her employers left the town hall. Angel spotted some people painting signs that said in big red letters, \"Beaches Closed! Trespassers will be arrested and prosecuted! By order of the mayor of Mystic Rock Harbor!\" Angel and her husband went into their limo and Angel turned M.A.I. on. \"Angel, is there anything I can do to help?\" the computer asked. \"Yes, where is the nearest psychiatric hospital?\" Angel said her question and M.A.I. went to work. \"Search complete. The closet psychiatric hospital, the Western British Columbia Sanitarium specializes in anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, depression, personality disorders, and schizophrenia,\" M.A.I. informed her mistress. Angel began to think and asks Mok, \"Do you think the killer has a bipolar disorder?\" \"I believe so, from what I can remember, serial killers tend to suffer from mania or some sort of depression,\" he answered. \"M.A.I., can you connect me to the head doctor?\" Angel asked the computer and M.A.I. went to work, again. \"This is Dr. Absolon Perrot, can I help you?\" a male voice asked. \"Yes, I'm Angel Lyons-Swagger, I'm a C.S.I. of the Mystic Rock Harbor PD. Two people were murdered and we believe that the killer might have bipolar disorder,\" Angel explained to the doctor. \"Can you describe how these victims were killed?\" Dr. Perrot asked. \"Both victims were stabbed to death, the killer blow was to the heart, and both victims were out in the water when the—\" \"Wait a minute, did you say they were killed while out on the surf?\" Dr. Perrot cut Angel off. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"Oh my word,\" the doctor breathed out the words. \"Dr. Perrot, do you know something that we don't?\" Angel asked. \"I need to see the victims first, do you still have them in your morgue?\" the doctor replied and Angel says yes, again. \"I'll head on out first thing in the morning,\" he added and hung up. \"Do you suspect that he had the killer as a patient?\" Angel asked Mok. \"It sounded like that,\" he replied as they reached their home.[Chapter 6] Chapter 5 By dawn, the town of Mystic Rock Harbor awoke to see that hundreds of strangers had crowded the dock with their boats. They also carried guns and other weapons. The police did what they could to control the crowd, but the new-comers ignored the constant orders as they bought supplies. A car honked its horn in order to get to the police station. Inside, Angel and Dr. Gideon prepared the bodies to show to Dr. Absolon Perrot. The car finally made it to the station and a dog humanoid wearing a necktie and a sweater vest came out. \"Excuse me, I am looking for a Ms. Lyons-Swagger,\" he asked the front desk clerk. \"I'm her,\" Angel replied when she stepped out of the morgue office. \"I'm Dr. Absolon Perrot, head psychologist of the Western British Columbia Sanitarium,\" he said and shook hands with her. \"I'm Dr. Hannah Gideon, coroner,\" Angel's friend introduced herself. Out on the water, the hunting party headed out in their boats, searching for the killer. In the morgue, Dr. Perrot looked at the victims, checking the stab wounds. \"Did you discover the make of the blade?\" he asked. \"The knife had a smooth blade, making a clean cut through the skin. I would suspect it was a steak knife,\" Hannah answered. Dr. Perrot nodded in agreement and he looked through his bag, pulling out some paper documents. He handed them to Angel, \"I know two patients who did acts like this,\" he said and Angel looked over the documents. There was a photo of a young dog man with messy black hair, wild looking eyes, and pale skin. The patient's name was Faustin St-Pierre and he had a history of violence since his youth. \"When did Mr. St-Pierre arrive at your hospital?\" Angel asked, her eyes still glued to the first document. \"He was transferred from the Maple Tree Psychological Center in Ontario when he turned 18. He had been living at the sanitarium for about 4 years,\" Dr. Perrot answered. \"Can you give me a detailed background on him? And what is his diagnosis?\" Angel asked, again. \"Mr. St-Pierre was diagnosed with ADHD, or attention deficit hyperactive disorder and a bipolar disorder at the age of 5. Children with ADHD usually defied their family's house rules or sometimes forget. St-Pierre on the other hand, ruled his house with an iron fist. His parents sent him to a rehab facility when they received the diagnosis. \"The doctors put him on some medication and sent him home, but everything changed when his parents brought home his baby sister. I never heard anything like this before, but St-Pierre attacked his sister with a knife and cut her wrists,\" Dr. Perrot explained and Angel and Hannah gasped when they heard the last part. \"His parents discovered him with the bloody knife and his sister was crying in pain and bleeding. After the baby girl went to the hospital, the St-Pierre's sent Faustin back to the rehab center. The doctors put him on stronger doses of the medication and that seemed to work, but I believe it was not enough. \"When Faustin was 13 and his sister, Aurore I believe her name was, turned 8, their parents went out and left them with a babysitter. Something snapped in Faustin that night, from what I read from police records, he had a violent outbrust and grabbed a steak knife from the kitchen and stabbed the babysitter first. He turned his attention on Aurore and stabbed her multiple times in the chest, the killing blow was to the heart,\" Dr. Perrot continued. \"He was sent to the Maple Tree Psychological Center, but the staff could not keep him under control. He had violent episodes every passing year and he attacked some of the other patients and he was sent to the Western British Columbia Sanitarium. I have had patients with violent behavior and I could tell that Faustin blamed the world for something, maybe he did not receive enough attention when he was young or his mind told him that,\" Dr. Perrot finished. Angel asks, \"Did he like to go swimming or scuba diving or something like that?\" Dr. Perrot began to think and replies, \"Yes, when he came to our facility he took an interest in our scuba diving trips to the ocean. It seemed to calm him quite a bit actually, but one time, he had a fight with another diver while out on the water. Faustin almost killed the diver, who turned out to be tourist, and he filed assault charges against Faustin. Faustin was banned from part-taking in the trips for about a year.\" \"Did he have a knife with him when he assaulted the tourist diver?\" Angel asked. \"No, Faustin pulled on the tube that connected to the scuba tank,\" Dr. Perrot answered. Angel looked at the second document, it featured a photo of a much older dog man with brown and gray hair, dark eyes, and dark skin. Angel read the document on Martin Savage, who had a history of arrests for destruction of private property, housing endangered plant species, and attempted murder. \"What can you tell me about Martin Savage?\" Angel asked. \"He is, what you call, an Eco-terrorist. He get so mad about housing development projects set in rainforests and oil drilling plants out in the ocean. He would go to rallies to protest, but he would take things to far. He one time attacked a woman who was part of one of the oil drilling projects. When his home was searched, it was full of plants that were on the endangered species list, but they were very toxic,\" Dr. Perrot explained. \"What about the attempted murder charge?\" Angel asked, again. \"Here's where I believe he carried out the murders of these two young people,\" Dr. Perrot said and explains, \"He attacked a group of young surfers with a knife. He wore scuba wear, along with a tank. When he was arrested, Savage kept on saying that he needed to clean the oceans from 'eco-hating scum'.\" \"What happened to them? Where are they now?\" Angel asked. Dr. Perrot looked down at the floor as if he was ashamed of something, but he answers, \"Both of them escaped about a month ago. I don't know how, but they somehow got out of the facility.\" \"I need to tell the sheriff and the hunting party, now we have names,\" Angel said and left the morgue.[Chapter 7] Chapter 6 Captain Davey Biggins spent word out to the hunting parties about the two escaped mental patients from the Western British Columbia Sanitarium. The hunters wasted no time in doubling their efforts in locating them, but the day went on without any progress. Angel was allowed to go home when the hunting parties came back to Mystic Rock Harbor. She located her husband and daughter out on the patio/pool, along with Nicholai and Minnie. \"Angel, what happened? I saw people go out in boats and were gone until a while ago,\" Mok asked and Angel sat down on a cushioned seat and told him everything. She allowed him to look over the documents Dr. Perrot brought on Faustin St-Pierre and Martin Savage. \"So, these two have a passion for water, that makes some sense that this killer or killers like to attack while out on the surf,\" Mok said to Angel and she nods, \"So, the hunting parties thought they could find them while out on the water? Shouldn't they also look on dry land? Maybe they set-up shelter where they can have easy access to the ocean,\" he added. Angel scratched her head, she hadn't thought of that. \"What if they are living out on a boat?\" she asked and Mok placed his hand on his chin. \"I better call Biggins,\" Angel said and was about to go inside, when she noticed a car coming into the driveway. \"Detective Lyons-Swagger?\" Dr. Perrot asked when he stepped out. \"Dr. Perrot, is there something I can help you with?\" Angel said. \"Well, I don't know if you can help me. I tried getting a room in a hotel, but all the ones in town are full. I asked Captain Biggins and he said you can help out in providing a room, if it's not too much to ask,\" the psychologist said and Mok came down. \"We have plenty of rooms,\" the retired rock star replied and held out his hand, \"I'm Mok Swagger.\" \"Dr. Absolon Perrot, head psychologist at the Western British Columbia Sanitarium,\" the doctor and they shook hands. \"I'll have my employees take your things. Come, I would like to talk with you,\" Mok replied and showed him up to the patio. Angel joined them under the shade of the patio umbrella and Zip brought out cold drinks. Mok showed the documents to Dr. Perrot. \"Angel has told me what you told her this morning. This is just a theory, but did St-Pierre and Savage ever speak to each other before the escape?\" he asked. \"Yes, I had observed them and Savage approached St-Pierre the day after St-Pierre arrived at the hospital. Faustin did not talk the first few times Martin spoke to him. One time, I suspected Faustin got frustrated with Martin and attacked him with his bare hands,\" Dr. Perrot answered and continues, \"However, Martin kept on visiting him. I thought it was unusual as both were anti-social.\" \"Yet you didn't suspect what they were planning?\" Angel asked. \"As I said, Faustin lived at the hospital for four years and Martin lived there for about six,\" the psychologist answered. \"How did St-Pierre react when he was told that he was banned from the scuba diving trips?\" Mok asked another question. \"Like a child who lost a turn with a toy, but Faustin, with his ADHD, let it all out in my office and I had to call assistance to take him to solitary confinement,\" Dr. Perrot answered. \"If you don't mind me asking, but why did Faustin attack the tourist?\" Angel asked, again. Dr. Perrot tried to remember and answers, \"From what the teacher in charge of the trip told me, Faustin said that the tourist was in his way. I suspect that the tourist was either swimming ahead of Faustin and was too slow or was obstructing his view of something.\" Angel scratched her head, deep in her thoughts, there was a lot going on inside this young man's head. She looked over Faustin's documents, again. \"Are some mental disorders genetic? Like ADHD?\" she asked. \"Actually, the causes of mental disorders vary among people, but there are a lot of illnesses that we don't know where they originate. Sometimes the disorders, like ADHD and bipolar, are likely the result of something in the home environment. For example, both parents argue in front of their children and they are verbally abusive to one another. Now, the children feel the hostile feeling in the air and the anxiety sets in and so does the guilt if the argument is about them,\" Dr. Perrot explained. Angel looked at her husband; he was a victim of domestic violence and he was almost killed at the hands of his alcoholic father. She leans into Mok's ear and whispers, \"Do you mind if I tell him about your father?\" \"You can, but keep me out of it,\" he replied. \"Dr. Perrot, can a child inherit his/her parent's abusive tactics, such as beating?\" Angel asked, keeping Mok out of the picture. \"Of course, children are vulnerable to witnessing or listening something, such as domestic violence in the home. Now, there are some children who see this violence as a common thing and usually copy the parent and hurt the people around them. However, there are some cases where the child will develop depression and/or anxiety disorders, but have not part-taken in any sort of violence, and it tends to lead to suicide,\" Dr. Perrot answered. \"What do you know about alcohol?\" Angel asked. \"Heck, I can't remember the exact number of patients I have who have alcoholic parents. Alcohol is not an anti-depressant, but it does give you a...how should I say this? A detachment from reality. People who abuse alcohol have no sense of what they are doing, right or wrong,\" the doctor answered and adds, \"I have read a study that the abuse of alcohol is behind many cases of domestic violence. I also read that children who live with an alcoholic parent tend to have great levels of depression and feel socially isolated.\" Angel took one quick look at Mok, he seemed to have been listening the whole time. \"One more question: would children find solace in a hobby? Like planting?\" Angel asked. \"Oh yes, children usually tend to start hobbies in order to get away from the broken household. The hospital provides whatever the patients' previous hobbies were or what they desire to part-take,\" Dr. Perrot answered. \"Now, if you don't mind I would like to take a short nap, it's been a long drive for me,\" he added and Zip showed him the way inside. Angel and Mok look at each other, she could tell that he was somewhat relived to hear what the psychologist said. Angel took his hand into hers. \"You are not like them,\" she said, \"You got the best help and look where you are now.\" \"I know, but sometimes when I go to sleep at night, I keep asking myself, would I end up like my father?\" Mok informed her. \"No, you are nothing like your father,\" Angel replied and he nods. \"Mommy, daddy!\" Emmy exclaimed when she got out of the pool. Her eyes were bloodshot and her fingers were pudgy. \"Emmy, how long were you in there?\" Angel asked her daughter, but the little girl shrugged. \"Come here you little mermaid,\" Mok said and dried Emmy off with a towel. \"Now Emmy, we have a new guest in the house, can you promise us to be a good little lady?\" Emmy nods her head and Angel places her onto her lap. \"What were you talking about to the stranger?\" Emmy asked. \"Grown-up stuff, you would not understand, but Emmy,\" Mok said to his daughter, \"There are dangerous people in this world, some don't know the evil they have done because they are...\" he trailed off to think of a good word. \"They are sick,\" Angel filled in, \"Not like having a fever, but kind of like having a painful headache that will not go away.\" \"Can't they take medicine for their headaches?\" Emmy asked in a curious tone. \"They do, sometimes it works and other times it doesn't,\" Angel answered and Cindy arrived to take the girl. \"C'mon, let's get you washed up for dinner,\" she said and both she and Emmy went inside. \"I don't know if she understood what we said,\" Angel said to her husband. \"She's three, so she would not remember much of the conversation,\" Mok replied and adds, \"Although I am sure she would want to study psychology.\" \"And get a job at a mental hospital? I don't think so,\" Angel said, although she knew that psychology would be good for Emmy to understand mental health. Angel looked out towards the ocean and wondered if St-Pierre and Savage would be found before the deadline.[Chapter 8] Chapter 7 Angel sat on the cushioned love seat in the living room and looked out at the ocean. She was lost in her thoughts about what Dr. Perrot said to her earlier. She looked through the documents, again for the one-thousandth time, but the words were the same to her. \"Miss Angel?\" a voice said and she almost jumped. Angel looked to see Toad with Captain Biggins and she stood up from the seat. \"Detective, we have some trouble,\" her boss said to her. \"What kind of trouble?\" Angel asked. \"Well, Mr. Danny Wilcox and his son, Travis went out for their regular crab hunting and according to Lillian, Danny's wife, they usually come back before sunset. Now it's almost dark and Lillian is getting worried,\" Biggins explained. \"Has anyone radioed them?\" Angel asked. \"I did sent a call out to their boat, but no answer,\" Biggins answered, \"I was wondering if you and I check out what they're doing.\" Angel nodded and went to retrieve her jacket, gun, and flashlight, and went with her boss to the boat yard. They took a police portal boat and headed out just as the sun disappeared on the horizon. \"Davey,\" Angel said after taking a look at the radar screen, \"There's something ahead, about 10 kilometers from here.\" True to her word, a shape appeared in the blackness and Biggins shown his flashlight on it. \"Look at that,\" he said. The figure was a motorboat, but it was empty and it appeared to be anchored. \"It's the Wilcox's boat,\" Biggins informed Angel. Angel knew right away that something was very wrong and she shown her flashlight on the water surrounding them, but there was nothing to see. \"I'm going in the water,\" she said and searched for a wetsuit and goggles. Once Angel was fully equipped, she took an underwater flashlight and went in. She swam toward the boat and shined her flashlight in the water. Then, what she saw nearly made her scream. Two bodies were strung by their necks with the anchor's string and they were beyond help. Angel immediately headed up and went back to the portal boat. \"We got bodies!\" she exclaimed when she got back on the boat. Angel and Biggins went to work in retrieving the bodies of Danny and Travis Wilcox. The two were laid on the police boat and Angel placed tarps over them and Biggins hoisted the anchor and tied the Wilcox's boat to the police boat. \"Crap!\" Angel exclaimed when she looked over the two bodies, \"They have been stabbed!\" \"This is getting out of hand, Angel. I don't how the mayor will explain this to the people,\" Biggins said, \"I mean, we need more time in finding the two psychos!\" \"I agree,\" she replied as the police boat headed back to town. When they got back, a coroner's van had arrived to take the Wilcox's back to the morgue. \"Please, don't tell me the echo-terrorists struck, again,\" Dr. Gideon pleaded Angel, but Angel had to nod. At town hall, the councilmen and the mayor had been summoned out of bed and they met with Angel and Captain Biggins and they explained of their discovery. \"Mayor Giroux, you have to reconsider about opening the beaches on Canada Day,\" Angel pleaded. \"I will not be made an enemy to the people! The beaches will open in time for Canada Day, whether you like it or not!\" the mayor shouted and adds, \"You have three more days to find and capture these lunatics and I hope you spend every hour in locating them, day and night!\" Angel was furious and she let it out, \"Why are you doing this?! Are you willing to risk people's lives with two serial killers on the loose?\" \"I am also willing to risk people's lives this upcoming winter? No, because I want every tourist dollar counted at the end of Canada Day and I hope it will be enough to pay off my heating bills!\" the mayor replied, angrily and he left, leaving a stunned silence in the room. \"That little prick!\" Biggins said, angrily, but Angel did not say a word. Biggins took Angel home and she went inside, hoping to not wake her daughter, who was usually asleep by this hour. \"Angel?\" she heard Mok's voice from their bedroom's porch. She didn't reply, instead, Angel took off her shoes and went to take a hot bath in the Jacuzzi tub. She felt like falling asleep in the tub and perhaps drown in the water. Then, Mok came in and came by her side. \"Angel, what's wrong?\" he asked, placing a hand on her cheek. \"The mayor is nothing but a coward,\" Angel answered and she explained of what happened earlier. \"Damn,\" Mok cursed, \"And you are certain it is the same killers?\" he asked and she nods. \"Angel, I'm so sorry. If I was there, I would've strangled Giroux,\" he added. \"Do you think I can find St-Pierre and Savage before Canada Day?\" Angel asked. \"With you understaffed? I say no,\" Mok answered and hugged her tight. \"If something happens on Canada Day, Giroux will probably be demanded, no, forced to leave office,\" he added. Angel got out of the Jacuzzi, dried off, and prepared for bed. \"Mok,\" she said to her husband, \"I don't want the girls to be in the water, heck, not even within ten feet of it.\" \"You mean the ocean? Of course, I won't let them go near it,\" he replied and both of them succumbed to sleep.[Chapter 9] Chapter 8 Angel was not sure how long she slept, but someone was shaking her shoulders and she woke up, Cindy was beside her. \"Angel, you're not going to believe this!\" she exclaimed and pulled Angel out of bed and turned on the TV. A news anchorman gave an announcement to the audience, \"A few hours ago, the prime suspect in the murders in Mystic Rock Harbor, Martin Savage was captured and arrested by a hunting party. Savage was a patient at the Western British Columbia Sanitarium, who escaped from the facility along with another patient, named Faustin St-Pierre. Savage and St-Pierre have been named as suspects for the murders of Jean Coppin from Prince Rupert and Rex Gagné, a local of the town. Police have not commented on what charges will be filed against Savage.\" \"WHAT?!\" Angel almost lost it and immediately got into her clothes. She had to get to the station and question Savage. She was grateful that Dr. Perrot was also up and about and was ready to go. Both of them rushed into Angel's squad car and it hurried away towards the police station. \"Do you think Savage surrendered?\" Angel asked the psychologist doctor. \"I am not sure, from what I understand, he can be quite stubborn and refuse to give up in a fight,\" Dr. Perrot replied. Just then, Angel slammed on the brakes when they came a crowd of people, shouting and holding up knives or sharp objects. Angel got into a space and got out of the car. She then saw a police cruiser that the people surrounded and they were banging on the back of the car. Some officers pushed the crowd away as the back door opened, revealing Savage in chains. \"Kill him! Kill him!\" the crowd shouted and tried to reach for the killer. Angel pushed through the crowd with Dr. Perrot and they protected Savage from the angry crowd and the media. \"Detective Swagger!\" some of the news people shouted at her and she turned to face them. \"Detective Swagger, will the town finally be able to sleep safely tonight now that one killer has been caught?\" one news reporter asked. \"Unfortunately, this town is still not safe as there is the second killer out there still and I advise every local to not go into the ocean as-\" she was cut off by Mayor Giroux. \"Of course this town is safe! There is no need for panic! Mystic Rock Harbor will be able to enjoy Canada Day without fear!\" he shouted to the news media. Anger and frustration filled Angel and she pulled the mayor by the arm and they went inside. \"Mayor Giroux, you don't know what St-Pierre is capable of! I believe he is the muscle behind these killings and he will be able to kill anyone he wishes!\" Angel exclaimed at the mayor, who is in complete denial. \"Listen to yourself detective, without Savage, which he may be the brains, St-Pierre will be so confused in what to do!\" Giroux said in an authoritative tone. \"Mayor Giroux,\" Dr. Perrot said and he appeared, \"I'm Dr. Absolon Perrot, I'm the head psychologist at the Western British Columbia Sanitarium and I looked over Savage and St-Pierre's cases.\" \"Oh, so you know what's going on inside their heads?\" the mayor asked. \"Listen to me, Savage may be the smartest, but so is St-Pierre. He suffers from ADHD and he sees things in a different light, than what 'normal' people see, but his intentions are violent and when he sees things that are not what he envisioned, he will get nasty and lash out at anyone,\" Dr. Perrot explained. Mayor Giroux looked bored when he listened to Dr. Perrot's explanation and seemed to not take this warning seriously. \"Listen, why don't you talk to Savage and see if you can get St-Pierre's whereabouts from him,\" he said and he walked away. \"I don't know how you deal with this maniac,\" Dr. Perrot said to Angel. \"He denies everything that is bad for business,\" she replied and they went back to the cells where Savage was kept. Martin Savage sat crossed-leg on the floor and seemed to be detached from reality. \"Martin Savage,\" Angel said and the old dog humanoid looked at her. \"You're purtty,\" Savage replied in an American southern accent. \"Savage, this town needs your help in locating your friend, Faustin St-Pierre,\" Angel said, but Savage rocked his body back and forth. \"Don't know where he could be,\" he replied and chuckled. Both Angel and Dr. Perrot watched as Savage fiddled with his fingers and his body went back and forth. \"Is he feeling defeat?\" Angel asked the psychologist. \"He might, or just the thought that he has been caught,\" Dr. Perrot replied and insisted that he talk to Savage alone. Angel was about to leave the cells when she heard Savage say something in a threatening way. \"You ain't gonna find Faustin, he will pick this town clean from earth hating scum,\" the deranged menace said. Angel went up to Savage and asks, \"You know where Faustin is? Admit it, you do know where he is hiding!\" \"Nice try missy, but he will continue our mission in ridding this planet from the ones who hate it,\" Savage replied and adds, \"Don't get these people's hopes up too high, Faustin will hunt them down like rabid dogs.\" \"Does that include women and children?!\" Angel shouted, angrily, but Savage stopped talking. Angel knew what Faustin St-Pierre would be capable of; he go hunting for swimmers out on the surf, no matter their age. Angel hurried out of the cells to look for the mayor, with Dr. Perrot behind her. She burst through the front doors of the station where the news media was still there and they swarmed her like bees. \"Everyone listen to me, the beaches are still not safe,\" Angel said to every news reporter who had a microphone. \"There is still one killer out there, Faustin St-Pierre and he is very dangerous. I advice every local and tourist of Mystic Rock Harbor to avoid going into the water until Mr. St-Pierre is caught,\" she explained and every news reporter shouted questions at her. Before Angel could say anything else, Mayor Giroux pushed her away and says, \"Don't mind her, she is talking nonsense.\" He then pulled Angel aside and the security prevented the news media from intervening. \"What are you doing?\" Mayor Giroux demanded Angel. \"Mayor, you have to listen to Dr. Perrot. Mr. St-Pierre is dangerous and if you send anyone out in the ocean, he will come after them, like a dog going after a rabbit,\" Angel said, but Giroux looked like he was not listening. \"Sir, I beg you, not only are you risking people's lives, but you are risking your reputation and the town's as well,\" Angel added. However, Giroux pointed to a billboard across the street, where a message in black ink said \"BEWARE! THE BEACH KILLER!\" \"Captain Biggins!\" Giroux shouted to the police chief and he showed himself, \"I want that message washed off and see that you catch the crooks who defaced the sign!\" The mayor was about to walk away, when Angel stood in front of him and says, \"You sir just stained your hands with these people's blood.\" Mayor Giroux just walked away and Angel also went away from the crowd, feeling defeated. \"Mommy!\" someone shouted and Angel turned her head to see her daughter, Emmy running up to her. Angel opened her arms and Emmy crashed into her, sending her backward on the pavement. \"Mommy, can we go to the beach?\" the little girl asked. A painful sting hit Angel's stomach; what was she going to say? \"I'm afraid we can't, Emmy,\" Mok said to his daughter, \"It's closed and you can get arrested for not obeying the rules,\" he added. \"But will it open for Canada Day?\" Emmy asked, again. Both Angel and her husband were not sure how to answer that question, but Angel had to tell the truth. \"It will, but Emmy,\" she said, \"I don't want you to go in the water, the waves will take you out to sea and you'll never be seen, again.\" Angel had to add the lie to protect the jewel of her life. Emmy waddled away towards Toad and Dr. Perrot, who were waiting by the car. Just then, Angel collapsed to her knees and began to sob. Mok came down to her level and held her tight. \"It's all right Angel, nothing bad will happen to Emmy and Minnie on Canada Day,\" he said, but Angel shook her head. \"It's not just the girls, I fear for anyone who crosses paths with St-Pierre,\" she replied and Mok kissed her forehead. \"I do, too,\" he said, helping her to her feet and they went to the car and they went back to the house. From the author: Hi there! I know it's been a long time with this story, but I thought of abandoning it since no one seemed interested in it. However, I could not stop my imagination and I decided to keep going. Stay tuned![Chapter 10] Chapter 9 Canada Day finally arrived and Mystic Rock Harbor was packed to the brim with tourists that came for the shops, restaurants, but mostly the beaches. However, in the police station, Captain Davey Biggins summoned every eligible officer to form a protection group for the swimmers out on the water. \"This is who we are looking for,\" Biggins said, handing out photo copies of Faustin St-Pierre, \"From what Detective Lyons-Swagger said, St-Pierre may be armed and dangerous, so approach him with caution.\" \"Question,\" one officer said, \"How are we to find him in the water?\" \"St-Pierre will be wearing full scuba gear, including an oxygen tank. If you see anything suspicious out on the surf, you are not to cause a panic,\" Angel informed the officers. Everyone headed out into police patrol boats, while Angel and some other officers went out to the beaches. Angel patrolled the Fire Sand Beach, where her family and friends were. She was surprised to see that no one was in the water. \"Good,\" Angel said to herself, but saw Mayor Giroux walking around, pestering some people to go in. \"If you don't get in there, we'll have a financial crises on our hands,\" he said to Mr. McMillian, his aid. McMillian obeyed and went into the surf and very soon, everyone followed suit. \"Damn,\" Angel muttered, angrily. \"Detective Lyons-Swagger?\" a voice said and Angel turned around to see a well-built, male rat humanoid. \"I'm Michael Giroux, the mayor's nephew,\" he introduced himself and shook hands with her. \"Nice to meet you,\" Angel replied and Michael stared out at the patrol boats. \"You have to forgive my uncle, he can be so stubborn, but he wants what's best for this town,\" he said and Angel nodded. \"Anyway, I just want you to know that this killer won't get away with these crimes,\" Michael added. \"You be careful than, I have a feeling that Faustin St-Pierre will show up somewhere,\" Angel warned and Michael nodded and walked away. \"Dad! Dad!\" Minnie exclaimed to Nicholai, \"Can I go in the water?\" she asked. \"Not here,\" her father answered and points towards the estuary, \"Just don't swim out too far from the shore.\" \"Can I go?\" Emmy asked her own father, Mok. The retired rock star took a few moments, staring at the estuary, as if something bad were to happen there. \"Alright, but stay close to Uncle Nic,\" Mok replied to his young daughter and the little girl walked away with Nicholai, but Minnie ran full speed toward the estuary. \"If there is any god or deity in this universe, I hope they judge me to the fullest in what I just done,\" Mok said to himself. Minnie was the first to reach the water in the estuary, while Emmy stayed on the shore, playing in the sand. Angel looked towards the crowd of swimmers with her binoculars. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, until she noticed an object moving about; it looked like a dorsal fin. \"Oh my god! Shark!\" someone screamed and everyone began to panic. The lifeguard whistled and ordered everyone out, but Angel shouts, \"Don't panic!\" There were people trampling on one another, desperate to get out, others were screaming. Angel hurried in to rescue an elder dog humanoid from being stepped on. Out in the water, the dorsal fin turned out to be a fake; it was just cardboard painted to look like a shark's fin. Two young cat boys came up to the surface and they came face to face with policemen rifles. None of the patrol officers took a shot as they were surprised to see that it was just a prank. \"It was his idea!\" one of the cat boys exclaimed, pointing to his friend. On the shore, Angel checked on those who were injured in the stampede and got a call from Biggins on her walkie-talkie. \"Angel, it was just a prank, set by two kids,\" Biggins said. \"Well I hope you track their parents down, because we got a lot of injured people over here,\" Angel replied, sounding irritated. Out in the estuary, Michael Giroux was in his boat, paddling toward Minnie. \"Hey!\" he called and Minnie waved at him. A little further away, a young rat woman was using her binoculars out on the water, when she saw a dark shape that was heading toward Minnie. \"HELP!\" the rat woman screamed, \"It's the beach killer! He's in the estuary!\" Angel heard the cries and thought it was another prank. The rat woman continued to cry out for help and Mok came up to his wife and says, \"Minnie and Emmy are in there!\" Angel went into a run towards the source of the cries. Minnie did not notice the unusual shape in the water, until something pulled her under. Who or whatever it was, Minnie was tugged deeper down into the water, but she was able to break the surface. \"HELP! SOMEONE!\" she cried out, before being pulled under. Michael Giroux saw what was going on and jumped from his boat and into the water. \"MINNIE!\" Nicholai screamed and went in, but he could not swim. Angel and the crowd ran as fast as they could toward the estuary. Michael fought with the assailant, he knew that it was Faustin St-Pierre, and he put a choke hold on the menace. Minnie swam away, but the killer turned his attention on Michael; Faustin broke out of Michael's choke hold and began to stab him. Crimson blood flowed out of Michael as the fatal blow hit his heart and he died instantly. Faustin swam as fast as he could toward the little mouse girl. \"C'mon Minnie!\" Nicholai shouted from the shore and Emmy cried out, too. Suddenly, Faustin pulled Minnie under the surface, again, and began to slice the knife through the water. Minnie dodged the weapon as best she could, but Faustin made a cut across her arm. The young mouse girl grabbed hold of Faustin's arm and dug her teeth into it. Faustin gave a cry of pain through the air-piece in his mouth and lost his grip on the knife. He pulled on Minnie's hair and with that, Minnie tore some fabric off of the wet suit that Faustin wore. \"MINNIE!\" Angel cried out and dove right into the water. Faustin swam away, but Minnie was in so much shock that she could not move her body and she floated to the surface. Angel grabbed hold of the mouse girl and swam back to shore. Emmy was crying as she was shocked by the many people trampling her sand barrier, but her father, Mok grabbed her and pulled her into his arms. Angel laid Minnie on the ground and checked for a pulse and noticed the deep cut on her arm. \"Someone call an ambulance!\" she ordered and gently tapped Minnie's cheeks. However, Angel noticed something in Minnie's mouth, and tried to pull it, but the mouse girl refused to open it. \"Minnie, it's okay, it's me. What's in your mouth? Open it,\" she commanded and Minnie spat out the fabric. Angel took it and looked at it; it was black and it had some letters \"r Mer\", but Angel could tell that it was part of a name. \"Minnie, where did you get this?\" Angel asked. Minnie was so shaken that Angel could barely hear her, \"I...bit...bad...guy...\" Minnie spoke the words as her whole body shook with fear and from the cold. Nicholai took his daughter in his arms. \"You bit the bad guy?\" Angel asked and Minnie nodded her head, \"Good girl, Minnie!\" Angel exclaimed, but the mouse girl didn't want to be hugged. Angel looked at the wet suit fabric, again; finally, she got some sort of clue and if she located the place that sold this particularly wet suit, she might be able to locate Faustin.[Chapter 11] Chapter 10 Minnie was cuddled up in a warm hospital bed. The cut on her arm was stitched up and wrapped in gauze. The young mouse girl was still in shock and the doctors wanted to keep her overnight. \"Minnie,\" Angel said, rubbing the mouse girl's cheek, \"What you did was very brave.\" \"Hey girlfriend,\" Cindy came into view, \"You deserve a reward, what would you like?\" \"Ice cream, no, frozen yogurt,\" Minnie answered, \"Vanilla with lots of chocolate sauce and chocolate jimmies.\" \"You got it, girlfriend,\" Cindy replied and Emmy went with her and they left the room. A doctor came in to check on Minnie and Nicholai kissed his daughter's forehead before leaving the room. \"I'll be back later sweetie,\" he said, gently stroking Minnie's cheek. When Nicholai left the room, he saw Mayor Giroux and rage filled his senses, and in a flash, Nicholai delivered a hard punch across the mayor's face. Angel and Mok heard the commotion and Toad pulled Nicholai away from Giroux. \"You son of a bitch! My daughter almost got killed because of you!\" Nicholai shouted angrily at the mayor and Toad held him back. Some police officers were about to handcuff Nicholai, when the mayor told them not to arrest him. \"He has the right to be angry at me,\" Giroux said and a nurse gave him some tissues for his bloody nose. Nicholai was so angry at the mayor that he kept on yelling at him for being neglectful in not taking Angel's warnings seriously. Giroux finally had had it and shouts over Nicholai's yelling, \"The bastard killed my nephew!\" There was a stunned silence that came upon everyone in the room and they looked at the mayor. \"Michael is dead?\" Angel asked in shock. \"Some people pulled his body from the water after the ambulance took Miss Minnie. Oh, my brother will never forgive me and I'll never forgive myself, not ever,\" Giroux replied and adds, \"But someone found this.\" Giroux held up a plastic bag that had a knife in it. The knife's blade was ridged, much like a steak knife and Angel looked at it. \"That is major evidence, isn't it?\" the mayor asked Angel. \"It is and so is this,\" she replied, holding up the wet suit material, \"Do you recognize the slogan? It might be part of a business name, but maybe you can help me out. And Mayor Giroux, if you help out, you might redeem yourself,\" Angel said and the mayor looked at the slogan. \"Hmmmm, I know that there is a local scuba diving store called Ouvrir Mer, I actually rented some wet suits and oxygen tanks there one time,\" he said and Angel felt a tinge of hope in breaking the case. \"Thank you Mayor and please, keep the beaches closed until St-Pierre is finally caught,\" Angel replied and left the hospital. ()()()()()()()() The detective located the 'Ouvrir Mer Scuba Diving School and Shop' and went in. The business sold items that included scuba diving equipment, especially oxygen tanks and wet suits. Angel asked the cashier, a young dog man with short black hair, if he saw Faustin St-Pierre and help up the photo. \"I have a good memory, but I did not see this guy. I was out for a couple of days last week. Let me get my dad, he is always here, maybe he knows,\" the cashier said and went up the stairs. A few seconds later, a much older male dog humanoid with some gray hair appeared. Angel held up the photo of Faustin St-Pierre. \"Yeah, he and some other guy came in about a week ago, I say way before the first murder. I can't believe I sold my merchandise to a couple of crooks!\" the owner said, bitterly. \"Please, maybe you can help me,\" Angel replied, her hope was rising fast, \"Did they use a credit card to buy the items?\" The owner looked through some files until he found a slip of paper and says, \"Sorry, they used cash.\" Angel felt the singe of disappointment, until an idea came to her head. \"How heavy are the oxygen tanks?\" she asked. \"They're made of Sherwood Steel, they are thicker and carry more oxygen, but they are heavier, I say about 35 pounds,\" the owner answered. \"Did one of the suspects asked for help in carrying one?\" Angel asked, again; she was getting somewhere. \"Yes, the older guy, the younger one didn't want help, but I did carry one of the tanks out to their car,\" he answered, again. Angel felt her hopes rise, again. \"What was the car model or did you get a tag number?\" she asked and braced for the owner's answer. \"The car was blue and white and there were words, no a name, 'Western British Columbia Sanitarium',\" he replied and Angel almost gasped. \"I was curious because I never met anyone from an insane asylum, workers or patients, but I decided not to ask why they were buying the items they wanted,\" the owner added and pulled out a slip of paper, revealing some letters and numbers. \"This is the tag plate number, at least, I think so,\" he said. Angel felt grateful and wanted to kiss the owner of the scuba diving store, but she replies, \"I can't thank you enough. I know the police station has not set up a reward yet, but if you like, would you settle for 1,000 in Canadian dollars?\" \"Oh, heck no, I don't accept cash reward, but maybe you can mention me in a speech or something after you catch the creep,\" he said. \"I will do just that, what are your names? You and your son?\" Angel asked. \"Sam Evers and my son, Sam Jr. Good luck in catching that killer,\" the owner replied. Angel thanked them, again, and left the store, heading back to the station. ()()()()()()() At the station, Angel checked the license number on her computer, and discovered something unusual. The car was registered to Dr. Perrot. She checked to see if he filed an auto-theft report, but there wasn't any. Out of curiosity, Angel looked up on the Western British Columbia Sanitarium in the search bar. She found an online article about St-Pierre and Savage's escape, however, it also stated that another patient named Henry Kneller had also escaped with the two. Angel did a search on Henry Kneller and the hospital's website revealed his records. He suffered from schizophrenia and there was a photo of him and Angel gasped after she looked closely at the features. He looked like the person who was in the jail cell! Just then, a breaking news bulletin was posted, and it said that police had found a body out on the hospital grounds. The police chief stated that the body was taken to the morgue to be identified. Angel printed the photo of Kneller and went into the cells, where the dog humanoid was sleeping. \"Hey! Wake up!\" Angel ordered and he woke up, \"Who are you?\" The prisoner did not answer, but he muttered something under his breath. \"You're not Martin Savage,\" Angel said and held up the photo, \"Is this you, Henry Kneller?\" The dog man stared at something and said, \"She got the mind of a smart person.\" \"Mr. Kneller, I need your help. Please, help me find Martin Savage and Faustin St-Pierre,\" Angel begged, but she saw that Henry Kneller was lost in a conversation with a person that was not there. Angel decided to confront Dr. Perrot about the whole thing, but before she left the cells, Kneller said something to her, \"Don't trust the good doctor, he's going to get himself arrested and thrown back in jail, again.\" \"Again? What do you mean again?\" Angel asked, hoping to more from Kneller. \"The Doc Perrot is dead in the ground, dead in the ground for a long time,\" he replied, but Angel found that to be confusing, but she kept it in mind. \"Davey,\" she called for her boss and he came forward. \"Sir, that person in the cell is not Martin Savage,\" Angel said and explained of what she discovered. \"That's incredible, did you get anything from this Henry Kneller?\" Captain Biggins asked, but Angel shook her head. \"He has schizophrenia, but he mentioned something about Dr. Perrot, saying that he is dead. How is that possible since he is at my house?\" Angel replied. \"Maybe Kneller thoughts told him that Dr. Perrot is dead, at least I think that is what schizophrenia does to someone,\" Captain Biggins said and Angel nodded in agreement. \"Can I ask you for a favor? Can you help locate a stolen car?\" Angel asked and gave her boss the information. \"Will do,\" he said and got to work. Angel gathered up her things and headed on home, it had been a long day, but there were a lot of questions buzzing inside her head. ()()()()()()()() Angel returned home in time for dinner and she joined her family at the table. Dr. Perrot also joined them, but he brought a bottle of red wine. Mok helped uncork it and fill up wine glasses, but Angel insisted that he fill up her glass all the way. \"Dr. Perrot, I have some questions,\" Angel said and he looked at her. \"I'm listening,\" he replied and looked at her in the eye. \"Why did you not file a report about your stolen car?\" she asked her first question. Dr. Perrot looked confused and Angel explained about the car Mr. Evers had described. \"Oh that, for a moment I thought it was the one that I brought here. Well, on the night of Savage and St-Pierre's escape, I guess I must've forgotten about it as I went home in my personal one. I honestly did not realize that it was stolen,\" Dr. Perrot answered. \"What is the car used for?\" Angel asked, again, referring to the stolen one. \"The staff is assigned to a special car, so that we can transport one patient to another hospital or we take any patient with anti-social disorders outside and away from the hospital,\" the psychologist answered. \"By the way, the person at the station is not Martin Savage,\" Angel said and everyone stared at her in shock. \"Who is he?\" Mok asked his wife. \"Henry Kneller, a schizophrenic who also escaped with Savage and St-Pierre,\" Angel replied and told them about the discovery of a body on the hospital grounds. \"Doctor,\" she said, looking at the psychologist, \"Is there anyone else missing from the hospital? A staff member or a patient?\" Dr. Perrot began to think, but he shook his head, \"I don't know, a lot of things were happening that night, so I don't know if anyone else is missing,\" he answered. After finishing dinner and the wine, Angel took Emmy to bed. She stared down at her daughter and prayed to whatever god or deity that existed to protect Emmy. Angel decided to look over Savage's documents once again, but she examined the photo of him more closely. A lot of questions were forming in her mind; what did Kneller mean when he said that Dr. Perrot was dead? Sure, she knew that he was schizophrenic, but what if he spoke the real truth. Just then, Cindy came in and says, \"Angel, your boss is on the phone.\" Angel answered and Captain Biggins says to her, \"Angel, we found the car, it's at the abandoned saw mill. I have called S.W.A.T., but if you want to join in, please come see for yourself.\" Angel realized that if she spoke to St-Pierre, she might get more answers and perhaps why he chose Mystic Rock Harbor as his killing grounds. She replies, \"Please, don't let anyone go in there, I'm on my way.\" She grabbed her badge, gun, and bullet-proof vest and headed out. From the author: Something suspicious is going on, but what is it? Is Dr. Perrot holding back something? Will Angel get more answers from St-Pierre? Find out next time![Chapter 12] Chapter 11 Angel arrived at the abandoned saw mill, where hundreds of police officers had surrounded the building. She got out of her car and hurried to find her boss. When she did, Captain Biggins says to her, \"You didn't bring the doctor?\" \"That did cross my mind, but there is something suspicious about Dr. Perrot. Has St-Pierre made an appearance?\" she asked him and Captain Biggins shook his head. \"How do you know he is in there,\" Angel asked, again. \"I actually saw him get out of the car, but when he saw me, he made a mad dash inside the mill,\" the police chief said. \"Davey, I want to talk to him, alone and unarmed,\" Angel replied, but Biggins looked at her in surprise. \"Are you crazy? He killed five people with a knife, who knows what he'll do if he uses his bare hands,\" he said, trying to talk Angel out of it. \"I want to talk to St-Pierre, please Davey,\" she urged him and Biggins gave in. He ordered everyone to make room for Angel as she went up to the door. She was armed with only a flashlight and she in the mill. The abandoned saw mill had a musty scent in the air and Angel's flashlight revealed some equipment that had been left to succumb to the elements. \"Faustin? Are you in here?\" she called out, \"It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you, I just want to talk to you,\" she added, but there was no repeal. Out of the corner of her eye, Angel saw a wet suit hanging from a hook and she saw that one of the sleeves had been torn from Minnie's bite. Suddenly, something crashed and Angel turned around to see Faustin St-Pierre, he had tripped over a box full of glass. \"Faustin,\" Angel said, staring at the young dog man, but he appeared to be much older. Then, he took a shard of glass and held it up, defending himself. \"No, it's okay, see I have no gun,\" Angel pointed out, \"Please, I just want to talk.\" \"That's what they all say, 'We just want to talk!' 'Please, talk to us!'\" Faustin replied in a bitter tone. \"Who is they?\" Angel asked. \"The doctors! The damn doctors! My parents refused to talk to me! They hate me! Everyone hates me!\" Faustin screamed, thrashing at the air with the shard. \"Faustin, please, calm down!\" Angel begged, but Faustin shook his head. \"I can't calm down! It feels as if I have all this energy that wants to get out of me!\" he shouted, pulling at his hair. \"Faustin, I understand, in fact, I learned quite a lot about you,\" Angel replied and watched as Faustin took a few deep breaths. \"You don't know me, my parents hate me, they sent me away to live in insane asylums because I am a freak!\" he said, still holding the shard. Angel knew she was getting close in gaining his trust and she continued to speak. \"Please, Faustin, tell me what your childhood was like,\" she said and Faustin looked at her in the eye. \"I was very energetic, I thought I was a king of the castle,\" he replied and Angel held back a laugh. \"Don't we all want to be rulers over our own castle?\" she asked and Faustin nodded. \"I don't know what I did wrong. All I did was yell at my mom and dad, there's no harm in yelling at your parents?\" he asked. \"I don't know, my parents and I rarely yelled at one another and my husband and I don't fight as we talk about our troubles. I think you blame your parents a little too much for something you did, not them,\" Angel replied, but Faustin disagreed on the last part. \"Faustin, with your condition, I believe it makes you feel that you are better than anyone,\" Angel added, but quickly changed the subject, \"But you love the ocean.\" \"Yes, yes, I do,\" Faustin replied. \"It calms you to the point where you don't feel angry at anyone at all, right?\" Angel asked, \"You love to swim in it, let the water around you wash away your worries and fears.\" At first, Faustin smiled at the mention of the ocean, but he frowned and says, \"If only those people stop polluting the ocean!\" Angel looked surprised when she heard this. \"Who told you those people were polluting the ocean?\" she asked. Faustin did not speak, instead, he kicked at a glass bottle and it shattered. \"Faustin, who or what gave you the impression those people were polluting the ocean?\" Angel asked, again. \"He said that they were,\" Faustin replied. \"Who Faustin? Tell me who it is?\" Angel asked, again, but before Faustin could answer, they heard a loud BANG! Angel turned to see a young officer holding up a gun and it was pointed at Faustin. Angel quickly looked back at Faustin and saw the blood spill out of his neck like a river. \"I got him!\" the officer called out, but Angel looked at him with fury. \"You idiot!\" she yelled out and hurried to Faustin's side, applying pressure to the bullet wound on his neck. \"Don't just stand there! Get the medics!\" Angel ordered and the other officers swarmed in. Angel pressed on the wound on Faustin's neck, but it was clear that he was not going to make it. \"Angel, what happened?\" Captain Biggins asked and saw the rage in her eyes. \"That asshole cop shot an unarmed man! Get the medics!\" she demanded and Biggins hurried away. \"Faustin! Stay with me! You're a fighter! You can do this!\" Angel cried out. Faustin's face turned pale and his breathing began labored, but he was talking about something. \"What?\" Angel asked, still applying the pressure on his wound. \"He kill...killed...Doc...Perr...\" Faustin said as he gurgled on his own blood. \"Dr. Perrot? Who killed him?\" Angel asked, just as the medics arrived. \"Sav...Sava...\" he tried to say. \"Martin Savage? He killed Dr. Perrot?\" Angel asked, again, but the medics ordered her to move away and they went to work. Faustin, with the last of his strength pulled Angel toward him and he spoke, \"He...said...to kill...those...people...he told...me...\" Then, Faustin's eyes began to roll back into their sockets. \"No, no, no! Please, Faustin! Stay with me!\" Angel begged him, but it was clear that he was almost gone. \"I'm...sorry...Aurore...I did...love you...sis...\" he spoke his last words to Angel and his head went limb. The medics checked for a pulse, but there wasn't one, so they began CPR. It was no use, Faustin St-Pierre was dead. Angel looked at him as the medics placed a white tarp over him and she looked at his blood on her hands and her clothes. She had the look of shock on her face, but she saw the officer who shot Faustin being yelled at by Biggins. Angel began to think of what Faustin had said before he died. He said that Savage killed Dr. Perrot; was it possible that the body found on the grounds of the sanitarium is Dr. Perrot? \"Angel, I'll take you back to the station,\" Captain Biggins said, placing an arm around her and led her to his vehicle. Angel then realized that the real culprit was at her house and she got on her cell, calling home. Cindy answered, \"This is the Swagger household, can I help you?\" \"Cindy, it's me, where's Dr. Perrot?\" Angel asked. \"Out on the porch, what's going on?\" Cindy said her question. \"Listen to me very carefully, I need one of your brothers to bring Dr. Perrot to the police station immediately. If he asks why, tell him that we caught St-Pierre and that he wants to speak to him,\" Angel replied and prayed that the imposter would take the bait. Cindy says, \"Okay, when will you come home? Emmy is getting a bit feisty because she wants you.\" \"I don't know, maybe an hour, try to keep her occupied,\" Angel answered and they hung up. Angel turned to face her boss and explained what Faustin said to her before he died. \"Holy smokes! Are you serious?!\" Biggins asked in shock. \"If Kneller said it, so did St-Pierre, but I'm going to need your help,\" Angel replied and told him her plan as they continued their drive back to the station. From the author: The truth will soon be revealed in the next chapter![Chapter 13] Chapter 12 Angel washed her hands in the restroom, cleaning off Faustin's blood, but didn't bother with her clothes. The trap was set and she and Captain Biggins and a few officers waited for the fake Dr. Perrot to arrive. Angel went into the interrogation room, where she will expose the truth, but before that, she found an online news bulletin. It said that the body found at the sanitarium had been identified and Angel printed it and planned to show it to the suspect. Just then, a limo drove up to the station, and Toad opened the car door and Mok and Dr. Perrot stepped out and entered the station. The two located Captain Biggins and Mok was the first to speak, \"Where's my wife? Is she okay?\" \"Mr. Swagger, please calm yourself, I would like to show the way for Dr. Perrot to the cells,\" Captain Biggins replied and Dr. Perrot followed him, unaware that he was being led to the interrogation room. \"First, please step in here,\" the police captain ordered and opened the door to the room and Dr. Perrot stepped in. Biggins quickly shut the door and Dr. Perrot noticed Angel, sitting by a table. \"Dr. Perrot,\" Angel said and stood up, revealing her bloody clothes. \"Oh my word, what happened to you?\" he asked, pointing to the blood-stained shirt. \"It's alright, it's not my blood, it's Faustin's,\" Angel answered and Dr. Perrot looked shocked and confused. \"Faustin St-Pierre is dead,\" she added. \"Oh dear, how did he die? Did he kill himself? I always thought he take his own life one day with his condition,\" Dr. Perrot replied. \"Do you always say that to every patient?\" Angel asked and he looked at her, \"No, he did not kill himself, it was an accident. You are quick to judge things, doctor,\" she added, but then, her voice changed, \"Or should I even call you that?\" \"Uh, Detective Swagger, I'm afraid I don't understand what you're saying,\" he said, but Angel's face showed the seriousness. She then showed the news bulletin and he looked shocked as he began to read it. The bulletin said that the body discovered on the grounds of Western British Columbia Sanitarium was identified as Dr. Absolon Perrot, who had been dead for a week. \"It's over, Martin Savage,\" Angel said and the deranged maniac smiled. \"How did you figure it out?\" Savage asked in a rather curious tone. \"I received information from unlikely sources. Henry Kneller, who took your place in order to fool the cops and the townspeople into believing we captured the brains behind the murders. However, I did look up on the search bar on the internet about the hospital and it happened to feature a news article about the escaped patients, but it wasn't two, it was actually three, you, Kneller, and St-Pierre. \"At first, like everyone else thought that we had you behind bars, but I then did a look over of your photo and of the real Dr. Perrot. I also had a talk with Kneller, he has schizophrenia, but he told me something that I knew that was not part of his fantasies. Before Faustin died, he told me the almost exact thing as Kneller said. I think that you don't have a mental illness, you're a manipulator. You took advantage of those who are easy to control, so they can do your dirty work and they take the blame,\" Angel said, her eyes locked on Savage's. \"Here's what I believe; you talked to Faustin for quite some time, but it took a while for you to gain his trust. You led him to believe that everyone swimming in the ocean was some harm to it and with Faustin's condition, he got angry and violent. The two of you made a plan to escape the sanitarium, but you need to eliminate Dr. Perrot, so you could assume his identity. However, in order to make everyone believe that you did escape and believe that Dr. Perrot was still alive, you brought Henry Kneller into your plan. \"Kneller was perfect due to his condition, but I don't know what you told him, but he followed your plan. On the night of the planned escape, Faustin confronted Dr. Perrot and killed him. Faustin and Kneller carried the body away and dumped him close to the hospital, but you stayed behind, so that you could inform the police that you were Dr. Perrot and that Faustin and Martin Savage escaped. \"After you fooled the police, you met up with Faustin, however, I believe you just let Kneller go, so that he won't be a burden and make everyone believe that we captured the brains behind the murders,\" Angel continued to speak. \"I don't know how you got cash, but that's how you paid with in order to obtain the gear needed to carry out the killings. However, the scuba shop owner got a little suspicious when he saw Dr. Perrot's car, but he decided to not ask you about it, but he did obtain the license plate number. \"As for your plan, you told Faustin what to do, while you stayed out of the way and let Faustin carry out your dirty work. You then went back to the sanitarium because you knew that someone would call about the murders and I had the audacity to let you in my house and believe ever word you said about yourself and Faustin!\" Angel said, angrily. Savage had featured a cold smile the whole time Angel had talked and he replies, \"I did speak the truth about the mental illnesses.\" \"True, but you failed to mention what kind of illness you suffer from,\" Angel said. Savage's grin faded and he says, \"Everything I have done was for the good of the environment.\" \"The good of the environment? Don't make me laugh Savage, the only good you've ever done was getting satisfaction from what Faustin did for you,\" Angel replied. Just then, Savage stood up, his eyes blazing and he looked ready for a kill. \"Now ain't that the truth,\" he said, very coldly and his hands reached for Angel. \"Don't move!\" someone shouted and Biggins and another officer grabbed Savage by the arm and pushed him to the table. Mok also came in, wrapping his arms around Angel. \"Martin Savage, you're arrest for the murders of Dr. Absolon Perrot, Jean Coppin, Rex Gagné , the Wilcox's, and Michael Giroux and for the attempted murder of Minnie Lenzo,\" Captain Biggins said and spoke Savage's Miranda rights and took him away in handcuffs. \"Angel,\" Mok said, \"That was incredible, but dangerous. I would've been so scared to confront him about all that.\" \"Faustin was not dangerous, just confused and unable to know what was right and wrong. Personally, I blame his parents for not bringing him up properly, all they ever did was send him to doctors and have him take medication, but that was not what he wanted. Everything got worse when his sister came into the picture and his parents dotted on her for being perfect. All Faustin wanted was to know if he was loved by his family, but I suspect that his sister Aurore was the only one who loved him, despite his illness,\" Angel explained and her husband nodded. \"As you said, Faustin was manipulated into believing what Savage said to him,\" Mok replied, \"Plus, I believe Faustin found an ally in you,\" he added and Angel laid her head on his shoulder. Martin Savage was placed in a squad car and it drove away. Captain Biggins summoned Angel into his office. \"Good work Detective Swagger, the mayor is going to be really happy when he hears about this. Just to inform you, if a judge does find Savage completely sane, he might get the death penalty,\" Biggins said to Angel, who nodded and she was allowed to go home. Angel rested her head on Mok's shoulder during the ride and when they got back to the house, Emmy jumped into her mother's arms. \"Did you catch some bad guys tonight mommy?\" the little girl asked. \"One, but he was a slippery one,\" Angel replied and took her daughter back to bed. \"Mommy, I'm not tired,\" Emmy whined and Angel looked at her, remembering what she said about Faustin. \"Emmy, I am exhausted, a lot has happened tonight,\" Angel said and Emmy got curious. \"Bad things?\" the little girl asked and Angel nodded, but an idea came to her idea. \"Want to go for a walk on the beach?\" Angel asked her daughter and Emmy nodded her head. The two got their jackets and went outside to the dark beach. Angel used her flashlight to illuminate the way for them. \"Emmy,\" Angel said and came down to her daughter's level, \"Remember what I said about the dangerous people in this world? Well, there are some people who are confused because they lack the...brain power to tell them what is right and wrong. However, there are some who would go to great lengths in getting what they want, even if it means doing evil things,\" Angel explained. \"How will I know who is evil?\" Emmy asked. \"When you are older, I will tell you and daddy will tell you, too,\" Angel replied and they resumed their walk around the beach. When Emmy started yawning, she and her mother walked back to the house. \"Angel!\" Cindy exclaimed, but hushed when she saw Emmy asleep in Angel's arms. \"The mayor just called, he wants to have a public conference in the morning and he demanded that you be there and tell everyone about the whole ordeal,\" Cindy explained. \"Let me guess, this conference will actually be good for business according to him,\" Angel replied and Cindy nodded. Angel took Emmy to bed and she prepared herself for bed. \"You actually don't want to talk about it,\" Mok said, \"To the people, I mean.\" \"I don't know what their reaction will be, when I talk about mental illness,\" Angel replied. \"Tell them, but also tell them that Savage was a manipulator, like you said, he was able to take advantage of Faustin's condition,\" Mok added and Angel nodded and was about to fall asleep when her husband gently rubbed her shoulders and he kissed her. From the author: I hope the interrogation scene was not too confusing as I really don't know what police do when they confront a suspect, besides watching it on TV. There will be one more chapter and an epilogue.[Chapter 14] Chapter 13 Out on a wooden platform outside town hall, the mayor, Captain Biggins, and Angel stared out at the crowd who gathered to hear about the news of the investigation. When the time came, Mayor Giroux goes up to the news microphones and he begins his speech. \"My fellow citizens of Mystic Rock Harbor, for the pass twelve days, trust me I have been counting since the first murder, this town has been rocked with fear and turmoil. I was blind by the impression that this town was safe enough for its citizens, but I was wrong when my nephew, Michael Giroux was murdered. \"However, this town would've continued to serve as a killing ground if it weren't for our brave detectives and police officers, but I believe the credit goes to Detective Angel Lyons-Swagger. She spent every hour in searching for the killers until they were caught. So, I hand it over to you, Detective Swagger,\" Mayor Giroux said and allows Angel to tell the story. Angel stood in front of the microphones and a couple of camera flashes went off and she began to speak. She explained about the escaped convicts of the Western British Columbia Sanitarium and of the murder of Dr. Absolon Perrot and Martin Savage assumed his identity. \"Savage was the brains behind the operation and he had the power of manipulation,\" Angel said and continued to explain about Savage gaining St-Pierre's trust. \"Faustin St-Pierre suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and Savage saw him as a perfect tool to carry out the murders,\" Angel added and some of the news reporters began to ask questions, but Angel ignored them and continued with her story. \"Savage returned to the sanitarium and he perfected Dr. Perrot's appearance and it fooled a lot of people, including me. Despite Savage's knowledge about mental illnesses and of St-Pierre's condition, he did fail to inform me of what he suffered from,\" Angel explained and went on with the investigation. She told the audience when she realized that the person the hunting party caught, who they thought it was Martin Savage was actually Henry Kneller. \"Kneller suffers from schizophrenia, but he told me some information that proved to be critical in the investigation. Last night, Dr. Perrot's stolen car was found and, in spite of Captain Biggins' protests, I confronted St-Pierre inside the abandoned saw mill and asked him questions as to why he killed those people,\" Angel said and continues, \"He was given the impression that the people he killed were polluting the ocean, thanks to Martin Savage. \"Unfortunately, Faustin St-Pierre was killed by accidental gunfire, but before he passed, he was able to inform me who manipulated him into believing that the murders did good for the environment. Martin Savage was confronted and arrested on charges of murder and attempted murder. A judge has yet to decide whether he is completely sane,\" Angel finished her story and the news personal began to ask questions. Angel then realized that she forgot to mention something or some people who helped in the investigation. \"Before Captain Biggins comes to answer questions, I would like to thank Mr. Samuel Evers Sr. and Mr. Samuel Evers Jr., owners of the Ouvrir Mer Scuba Diving School and Shop for their help in providing critical information in the case,\" she said and she allowed her boss to take over. When the conference was finished, Angel joined with her family in the crowd. \"That was truly amazing,\" Mok commented and he kissed Angel's forehead. Emmy wanted to be lifted up by her mother, so Angel did, and held her daughter tight. \"Before we go to the beach, I want to stop somewhere,\" Angel said and they went to the car and Angel told Toad where to go. ()()()()()()() When the car arrived at the Ouvrir Mer Shop, Angel gave a look of surprise and amazement. A long line was out the door and it seemed that Angel's thanks to the owners arose the shop's business. Angel, taking Emmy got out of the car, and squeezed through the crowd to get in. \"Hey, it's Detective Swagger!\" someone shouted and then came the frenzy of shouts and photo taking. \"C'mon now, people! Give her some space!\" Sam Evers Sr. demanded and helped Angel and Emmy get out of the crowd. \"This is incredible, detective. As soon as you spoke your thanks for me and my son, a whole bunch of people have been coming in. Now, I'm booked on scuba lessons for the rest of this summer and for this fall and winter!\" Mr. Evers Sr. exclaimed. \"Congratulations Mr. Evers and tell your son I said that,\" Angel replied and he nods and notices her daughter. \"Who is this little lady?\" he asked. \"My daughter Emmy, she is not old enough for scuba diving lessons,\" Angel replied and Mr. Evers placed a hand on his chin. \"I want to scuba dive, mommy,\" the little girl said. \"Tell you what; since business is booming and it looks like I'm going to have to hire more swimming instructors, I'll see if there is anyone would be willing to teach little ones and when Emmy is old enough, the lessons would be free of charge,\" Mr. Evers replied. \"Oh, I really don't want to do that, how about 10% off?\" Angel asked and Mr. Evers decided to haggle. \"How about 50%?\" he asked, but Angel shook her head. \"15,\" she said. \"25% off the lessons and I'll take an additional 25% off of the equipment used in the lessons,\" Mr. Evers spoke his final haggle. \"Deal,\" Angel replied and they shook hands and Mr. Evers went back to work. Angel and Emmy went back to the car and it drove back to the Swagger house.[Chapter 15] Epilogue The beaches at Mystic Rock Harbor were reopened after the mayor was given the all-clear from the police station. The tourists and locals had packed the beaches and ever since, there were no casualties of murder. Angel went out on the surf, enjoying the serenity of the water, but she remembered what she said to Faustin before he died. Minnie came back from the hospital, but she was a little afraid of going back into the water. Her father, Nicholai assured her that no one was out there in the surf besides the swimmers. The day turned out to be such a success for the town's business owners and Mayor Giroux had all the money made that day be counted. It took a long time, but in the end, it was stated that at least 18 million in Canadian dollars was made, and it was a new record. \"Next year, I am sure we will pull it off on Canada Day,\" Mayor Giroux said to the council. When sunset came, the Swagger house held a party for Angel and the police department's hard work in capturing Martin Savage. Captain Biggins announced to everyone that Savage had faced a judge earlier and he was declared completely sane. \"Savage, of course, pleaded not guilty, but the judge decided to sentence him to death,\" Biggins added and everyone cheered. Out on the patio, Angel watched the sun set over the ocean's horizon and her husband joined her. \"You know, I think you would become a great psychologist,\" Mok said, but Angel shook her head. \"I've had enough of the mentally impaired, but there will be plenty to deal with in the future,\" she answered, \"However, I just hope that no other deranged lunatic would come here to this town.\" \"I agree,\" Mok replied and they went back inside to rejoin the party.

If I'd been thinking straight, I would've gone anywhere but here. Usually, New Yorkers can be counted on to ignore the strangers around them, but try to have an emotional breakdown in front of a hospital. \"What's wrong?\" he asks, walking to where I'm leaning against the building. I shake my head and wave him off again, but this guy just isn't taking the hint. It's bad enough that I'm crying so hard that I can barely catch my breath. I don't want an audience. \"You're hyperventilating,\" he declares, putting both hands on my shoulders and, without warning, bending me over so that I'm staring at my knees. If I hadn't had the wall to lean against, I probably would've fallen. \"Ok, slow down,\" he instructs, keeping one hand on my arm to help me balance while the other gently pats my back. \"Take slow, deep breaths.\" Who is this guy and why won't he leave me alone? I try to pull away from him, stand up and leave him behind, but he holds me down effortlessly, his deep, gruff voice repeating the instructions. Soon, I give in and start trying to obey his commands. It's just not working very well. I want to take a long breath, but instead it turns into several quick, choking gasps. \"Just calm down. Don't think about anything but your breathing. In... and out.\" His voice is so close, overshadowing my thoughts. For a moment, I forget about my guilt, my fears, and just concentrate on controlling my body. In a few minutes, I'm finally doing ok, with just the occasional hitched breath. He releases his hold, helps me stand up, and I get my first look at my would-be savior. He's younger than I thought, about my age, but standing over a head shorter than me and wearing a black leather coat and worn jeans. His face sports a thick beard and harsh features, but they're softened by his eyes. There's an almost gentle happiness there, tempered with concern. \"You wanna talk about it?\" To my surprise, for a second I'm tempted by his offer. Then, the weight of my guilt comes back, settling on my shoulders as a familiar pain returns to my chest, and I shake my head. \"Fair enough,\" he answers, surprising me by his quick acceptance. Looking me up and down critically, he says, \"You look like you need a drink. C'mon, I'm buyin'.\" He waves me towards a bar about a block away, and I know he's right. I really could use a drink. Who am I kidding? I could use a whole bottle, but I can't leave. No matter what Jane thinks about me now, I won't leave her here alone. She might not want me in the room anymore, but I have to stay close by. \"I can't leave,\" I answer, and then the hiccups start. He just eyes me again, watching me hiccup like a kid after a temper tantrum. \"Well, it looks like you need something. Let's go inside. I'll buy you a coffee.\" He takes my hand and leads me back into the hospital and through the corridors to the cafeteria. Dumbly, I allow myself to be led along until we're standing in front of the coffee decanters. Why is he doing this? Doesn't he have somewhere else to be? What's he doing at the hospital, anyway? Is he a doctor? Maybe he was just arriving for work and I caught his eye. Maybe I'm keeping him from real patients that need his help. No, I decide. He's no doctor. He must be visiting a patient here, and I'm using up his visiting time. \"Sugar? Cream?\" He asks, but I don't answer. I'm too distracted by my inner musings. I hiccup again, and he says, \"Ok, I'll take that to mean you want it black.\" He gets us both black coffees, pays the bored cashier, and leads me over to one of the tables in the almost empty cafeteria. Setting my coffee in front of me, he sits down on the opposite side and starts drinking. I expect him to say something. I'm sure he's going to demand to know what's wrong with me, but he just sits there calmly and drinks. \"Why?\" I ask in between hiccups. \"Why what?\" he asks, looking up at me with those incongruously gentle eyes again. \"Why are you helping me? Why do you care?\" He shrugs, and says, \"I dunno. Maybe you remind me of someone.\" \"Who?\" He takes another sip of his coffee and answers, \"Me.\" \"What?\" \"Look, I don't know what's goin' on with you, and you don't have to tell me. I just... I remember what it's like, and I couldn't leave ya without tryin' to help. When I was like that, my Marie... That's my wife. She wasn't then. Didn't even know her then, but, anyway, she stopped and helped me out and I just... wanted to help you.\" \"Don't you have somewhere to be?\" I ask, finally reaching for my coffee and taking a sip of the bitter concoction. \"I mean, aren't you visiting someone?\" \"I was. My wife kicked me out of the room. Sent me home to pick up a few of her things and to catch some shut-eye.\" At my confused look, he added, \"She just had our first. A girl. Eight pounds three ounces.\" As he told me about his daughter, his eyes practically shone. I could tell he was truly, deeply happy. This is what I wanted with Jane, what I thought we might start working toward before the assault. Now, I just don't know. Will she ever be able to forgive me for what I didn't do and accept me for what I did, what I've become? My expression must've changed because the man's trying to comfort me again, repeating trite sayings that I've heard throughout my life. It's not helping. He's happy. It's not his fault that my life's fallen apart. I wonder what'll happen when Jane's released. Where will she go? I want her with me, but that's not likely now. Besides, she'd have to return to the apartment. Just the thought of going back there makes me shiver. The blood's still there, blood and... other stuff. I can't bear the thought of having to clean that up myself. I don't even want to think about it. The man's hand is resting on my arm now and he's stopped talking. He must've realized it wasn't helping and instead satisfied himself with sitting in quiet support. \"Eddie!\" a voice shouts across the quiet cafeteria, and we both look up to see Liz running over to our table. \"I've been looking for you everywhere.\" \"Why?\" I ask, confused. \"Jane's asking for you.\" \"But her sister...\" \"Forget about Alice. I don't know what's going on with her. Jane kicked her out. She knows that nothing that happened is your fault.\" \"Some of it is,\" I answer in a whisper. \"What?\" Liz asks loudly. \"I... the guy that was trying to kill her... I... He's dead. I... I stopped... I...\" I can't say it. I can't force out the words that I killed him. \"Good for you,\" the gruff-voiced man responds. \"What?\" I ask in surprise. \"You killed him. Good for you.\" \"What?\" I repeat, dumbstruck. \"You said he was tryin' to kill your girl.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, then.\" he says, nodding at me. \"You did the right thing.\" \"But... I'm a murderer,\" I answer, looking back and forth between him and a strangely quiet Liz. \"No, you're not. Would you have rather he killed her?\" \"No!\" He sits back, satisfied with his argument. \"Go on. Go see her.\" I get up and walk towards the exit with Liz silently following me. Right before I leave, though, I turn around. \"Thanks,\" I say to the man still sitting with our coffees. \"Don't mention it,\" he answers. ----- When I walk into Jane's room, her face transforms into a relieved smile. \"Hey,\" I say, smiling back at her. She simply reaches out her right hand towards me. When I walk over to the bed, sit down, and gently grasp her hand, she lets out a contented sigh and relaxes back into the pillows. Not five minutes pass before she's sound asleep. ********** See part thirteen.[Chapter 13] Home Construction, Soul Repair - Part Thirteen by Khaki For disclaimers, etc., see part one. ********** POV: Jane When I wake the next morning, Eddie's still sitting next to my bed, still holding my hand, as if even when I was asleep, he wanted to reassure me of his presence. He's snoring lightly, slumped back into the chair with his head resting against one shoulder at an angle I know he'll soon regret. My left hand and my ribs ache, but I don't have the heart to release his hand and find the morphine button on my IV. It's a dull pain; one I can endure until Eddie wakes up. His jaw's clenched, the muscles of his face taut, as if even in sleep he can find no rest. The flesh around his eyes is puffy and almost bruised by dark circles. How long has it been since he's slept a full night? Every time I've woken up, he's been there, ready with soothing hands and comforting words. I have him, Liz, family, friends, doctors, and nurses all doing what's best for me, but is anyone doing anything for Eddie? He's suffering. Yesterday, when I asked him how I got hurt, he could hardly force out the words, and then when Alice came... I have to call her. How could she be so purposefully cruel? In my whole life, I've never known her to do something like that. And Eddie. When she blamed him, practically yelling accusations, I saw it in his face, his eyes... He broke. It wrenched my heart, the pain expressed in every movement as he turned and left. Even then, even when it would've been so much easier to just leave me here, he came back. He sat down, smiled at me with reddened eyes, and held my hand until I fell asleep. How can I ever deserve someone so wonderful? The door whooshes open, breaking the silence, and a cheerful voice calls, \"Good morning, Jane. And how are we feeling today?\" I pucker my lips trying to shush the nurse, but it's too late. His snoring's stopped. A moment later, he lets out a groan and reaches a hand up to rub at his probably very stiff neck. The nurse, a new one with long red hair braided down her back and a smile so saccharine, I'm sure I'll develop cavities before the end of the day, ignores my hateful glare and begins studying my chart. Eddie's still massaging his neck with one hand, but he's looking at me now, his features even more haggard than when he slept. \"Hey. How're you doing?\" I nod to him and answer, \"Better,\" with a gravelly voice. \"You need anything? Some water?\" \"Water will be fine,\" the nurse interrupts in a chirpy voice. \"It'll help with our walk later.\" \"Walk?\" I ground out. \"Yes, Dr. Roberts has cleared you to go ambulatory. Of course, before you can do that, we have to remove your catheter,\" she says, reaching down and flinging the covers back so that only my feet are covered. \"Hey!\" I yell. Ok, so my throat's sore, and I can't really take a full breath without pain, but that made me mad. I'm lying here, probably looking the worst I have in my life, and she whips off my blankets right in front of Eddie. I'm spread out so flat that I can't even tell if this joke of a hospital gown is pulled down far enough to keep Eddie from seeing everything God gave me. \"What are you doing?\" Eddie demands of Nurse Nicey-Nice while I'm using my good hand to feel around for the bottom hem of my gown and see if I can't pull it down further. \"It's ok,\" she answers Eddie and then turns to me. \"It's ok, sweetie. There's a 'do not disturb' on the door, and it's not like he's never...\" She shrugs. \"...seen you before. Now if you'll just move your hand...\" \"No.\" That's just the point. He never has seen me completely naked, and I really don't want this to be his introduction. \"Hon, if I don't take it out, walking's gonna be pretty uncomfortable,\" then her voice, although still friendly, turns rnfirm, \"and the doctor wants you walking today.\" \"But...\" \"Do you want me to leave?\" Eddie asks, his eyes focused completely on me. Well, if she's really going to do what I think she's going to do, then yes. And no. I really don't want him to see me like this, but... \"Will it hurt?\" I ask the nurse. \"Some patients have found it... uncomfortable.\" Uncomfortable. I've heard that word before. It means \"damn painful, but it passes quickly.\" These medical types have a talent for understatement. My decision made, I look back at Eddie. \"Can you stay?\" He smiles and nods before scooting the chair even closer to me. I look down at where the nurse is waiting and then back into his eyes. I release the protective hold I had on my gown and say, \"Just... don't...\" \"I understand.\" he says, taking my now free hand. He lifts it and kisses my fingers. \"I won't.\" Then, I feel air on my bare skin, and the nurse gets to work. ----- I discovered not two hours later that probably the worst thing about getting a catheter out is that you've got to get out of bed to pee again. With broken ribs and a trussed up arm, it's quite a production just getting me on my feet. First, the nurse wrangled a sling over my head and good arm. I know she was trying to be gentle, but my ribs sent twinges of pain every time I moved. After the sling was in place, she released my arm that resembles a padded erector set more than a part of my body from the traction above my bed. Getting it into the sling around my neck was another few moments of misery. Two pins holding my bones in place stick out past the bandages, and even though they're attached to each other with a fixator, when they get caught on the fabric of the sling, it still hurts like hell. Eddie tried to help, but mostly all he could do was watch. That is, until I had to sit up. With a bad arm on the left side and bad ribs on the right, I can't really leverage myself up without help. Kimberly, the redheaded wonder nurse, got on one side and told Eddie to get on the other. Then, holding onto my shoulders, they pulled while I grunted and pushed, and, oh yeah, \"ow\"ed myself up. \"Ow ow ow OW ow ow OW OW ow.\" Don't ask me why, but the muttered mantra really seemed to help me get moving. Also, when I raised my voice during particularly painful shifts, Kimberly and Eddie reacted by being more careful. Finally, finally, I sat up. Then, all it took was swinging my body around so my legs hung over the side of the bed and sliding down over the edge to get on my feet. It's weird to be standing after days flat on my back. I feel dizzy, and I can't quite find my balance. If I fall now, without my arms to catch me, it's really gonna hurt. Kimberly puts a surprisingly strong arm around my waist and leans in to support me, while Eddie takes hold of my good arm on the other side. Then, with Kimberly pulling the IV tree along, the clumsy dance to the bathroom begins. It's only a few feet, but I'm still pretty proud of myself when we reach the door. Of course, my entourage and I can't fit through the way we are, so Kimberly turns us sideways and we shuffle through like a slow, bedraggled chorus line. That's such a funny mental image, I want to laugh. Then, I see my reflection in the mirror, and I want to cry. Both of my eyes are blackened like I've been punched, the bruising standing out in sharp contrast to my pale, drawn face. In fact, every inch of exposed skin I can see sports a variety of bandages, bruises, and abrasions. I already knew my arms were bruised, but my shoulders, my jaw... my neck. My neck has a little square bandage covering where the breathing tube used to be, but the rest of the skin is exposed. I can see two, purple, overlapping handprints enveloping my neck. The thumbprints are in front, but as I turn my head in the mirror, I can see where the fingers wrap around to the back. The skin of the bruise is swollen, standing out like a tenderized tattoo. It never really hit me until this moment. Oh, I'd heard Alice yelling that I'd almost died and I'd been shocked, but until now, it didn't really seem real. I've always considered myself a nice person. I mean, who would ever hate me enough to actually want to take my life? But standing here, seeing this, it's undeniable. Someone actually wrapped their hands around my neck and tried to kill me. Kill me! Poof, no more Jane. \"C'mon, honey, we're almost there,\" Kimberly encourages, but my feet are frozen to the tile. I can feel and see tears welling in my eyes, and when I look at Eddie's reflection, his eyes are equally moist. \"Jane,\" he says in an unsteady voice. \"You survived. That's the important thing.\" \"But...\" I release his hand from my grasp to gesture at my reflection in the mirror. \"I almost.\" \"You didn't,\" he says, leaning in to kiss me gently on the hair above gauze wrapped like a sweatband around my head. \"And I thank God every second of every day that you didn't.\" \"Besides,\" Kimberly adds with a bubbly voice. \"The scars will hardly be noticeable in a few years.\" Scars? A few years? What? \"What scars?\" For the first time, I see a chip in Kimberly's perky personality as she searches for a positive spin on what she'd just said. \"You know, your hand... You can't expect to have surgery without getting a scar. That and your trach scar will...\" \"Trach scar?\" Eddie jumped in. \"Yes, the tracheotomy... To help her breathe.\" She looked back at me. \"It's a small scar, and after a few years, most people don't even notice. Besides, as long as you wear tall collars, turtlenecks, or scarves, no one will even see it.\" My neck will be scarred for the rest of my life? Every time I look in the mirror, every time Eddie sees me... we'll never be able to forget. Eddie. What if he doesn't want a girlfriend with scars? Damaged goods. Damaged... Oh, no. I don't like where my mind is going, but looking at myself in the mirror again, the injuries stand testament to the ferocity of my attacker. Attacker. While he had me down, did he... I can hardly force myself to think the word, let alone ask Eddie or the nurse. Would they tell me even if I asked? Have they been keeping it a secret to protect me, hoping that my memory of that night doesn't return? Did anyone even check? Was I raped? ********** See part fourteen.[Chapter 14] Home Construction, Soul Repair - Part Fourteen by Khaki For disclaimers, etc., see part one. ********** POV: Jane \"Jane, scars don't matter. You're going to get better and everything will be ok,\" Eddie says, nodding at me in an attempt to be reassuring, but his tired eyes reveal doubt and sorrow. I can't ask him. He couldn't tell me even if I did. He hasn't been able to the past few times I've asked him what happened to me. If I question him about this, it'll only hurt him more. Wordlessly, I look at the toilet and then at Eddie before cocking my head towards the doorway. \"Right... I'll just be outside, then.\" I force a smile and then turn away, walking towards the toilet with Kimberly at my side, ready with support if I stumble. After a few steps, she moves away from me and grabs some sort of plastic bowl off the back of the toilet. Then, she lifts the seat, attaches the bowl to the rim, and sets the seat down again. \"What are you doing?\" She turns and says, \"Oh, we monitor your fluid intake and output until you leave the hospital.\" \"You measure my pee? Why?\" \"We want to ensure your kidneys are functioning properly.\" \"But I didn't hurt my kidneys, did I?\" \"No, but you did have surgery and you were on a renal catheter. It's just a precautionary measure,\" she reassures, while urging me to turn around and sit. \"Besides, if I know Dr. Roberts, you'll be checking out by the end of today anyway.\" \"I'm going home today?\" \"Not on my say so, but I bet you will.\" She winks, gives me a toothy smile, and walks over to the doorway. \"Just call when you're ready to come out, ok, hon?\" she says as she steps out of the bathroom and shuts the door. I'm alone, alone for the first time in days. I've been told so many things in just the past few minutes, though, my mind can hardly keep up. I've been horribly beaten, scarred for life, possibly raped, and now I'm going home to the place where it all supposedly happened. How should I feel about that? What can I do? When I glance at my good hand resting in my lap, I get an idea. If I was raped by the same person that tried... tried to kill me, there'd at least be bruises, right? Without a second thought, I reach down and pull up the bottom of my hospital gown, trying not to upset my ribs in the process. I look down and a massive bruise meets my gaze, a bruise running from my right hip, up my side, and disappearing under my gown, a bruise that has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with why my ribs hurt. Everywhere else, there's nothing but pale, unmarked skin, no hand-shaped bruises like there was on my throat, in fact, no wounds at all. I was almost killed, but I wasn't raped. ----- \"Jane?\" It's not until I hear Eddie's worried voice that I realize I've been in here a while. My ribs are throbbing, and as I take a shaky breath, the pain stabs up my side like knife points. My face is wet with tears, and I can't stop crying. They're tears of relief because I wasn't raped, tears of sorrow because I've been forever marked, tears of pain because of my wounds, and tears of grief for what this situation is doing to Eddie and me. Is there any hope for the relationship I want, the relationship we might have had if I wasn't injured? Will he ever look at me the same way again, or will he only see the reminders of the attack? Will there ever be a time when I don't see pain reflected in his eyes? \"Jane, I'm coming in.\" \"No!\" I cry out, then take a few shallow breaths, trying to control my wavering voice. \"No. I'm... ok.\" I gingerly wipe the tears from my cheeks and lurch up to my feet. Using my IV stand for support, I lean over and slam the toilet lid closed before washing my hands and shuffling to the door. I don't have it open more than a crack before someone on the outside pulls it out of my grasp. Eddie. He hurries to put an arm around me for support, admonishing, \"Jane, you shouldn't be walking without help.\" \"There's nothing wrong with my legs. I'm just a little wobbly.\" \"He's right, sweety,\" Kimberly adds, her chirpy voice grating on my nerves. \"You don't want to re-injure yourself right when you're gonna go home.\" Eddie's head snaps up, and he asks, \"What?\" \"Well, it's still up to Dr. Roberts, but from her chart, it looks like she's on track to check out at the end of the day.\" \"I've got to go.\" \"Eddie?\" \"I'll be back to pick you up, and I'll get Liz to stay with you until then, but if you're coming home tonight, I...\" He pauses for a moment, then says, \"You do want to come home with me, right? If you don't... If you want to live with your sister...\" \"Eddie, home is with you... right?\" He closes his eyes and releases a relieved sigh. \"Right.\" \"At least wait until Dr. Roberts does his rounds before you go,\" Kimberly advises. ----- The doctor did clear me, though. He took out my IV that morning, and at a little after 5 p.m. that night, Liz and Eddie helped me into a cab. I thought I might be at least a little apprehensive when I walked into the apartment again, but I wasn't. I guess that's the good thing about amnesia. Besides, Eddie was nervous enough for all of us. He insisted that Liz and I wait by the door, and he walked through the apartment, checking every room and every possible hiding place before we were allowed to cross the threshold. As I walked to my bedroom, I scanned the apartment, looking for any evidence of what must've happened that night. I don't see any differences, though, until I catch a glimpse of the entertainment center against the far wall. The cabinets that had covered the lower section are missing. That must be where it happened. A chill ran through me at that thought, but I shrugged it off and kept shuffling towards my room. Liz helped me get settled in bed while Eddie patrolled the apartment yet again, this time checking and rechecking the locks on the doors and windows. When it became apparent that I could barely keep my eyes open, Liz left. I settled into the long-desired comfort of my own bed and fell asleep. Now, I'm awake again, and I don't have to look too far to see why. Eddie's sitting in a chair right next to my bed. He must've been watching me sleep. \"Jane, do you need something?\" I squint, but he's still there looking at me expectantly. \"What are you doing here, Eddie?\" \"Making sure you're sleeping all right.\" \"I'm fine. Aren't you tired?\" \"Can't sleep.\" \"Have you even tried?\" He shakes his head. \"Look, don't worry about me. You're the one who just got out of the hospital.\" \"Yeah, but I've been sleeping.\" A yawn interrupts me, but then I add, \"I'm ok, Eddie. Go to bed.\" ----- He left my room that night, but from the sounds of feet walking across the wooden floorboards and locks clicking open and shut that woke me later that night, I don't think he went to bed. In fact, I don't think he's really lied down and slept more than a few hours in the past two days I've been home. Tonight, I threatened to lock him in his room if he didn't get a decent night's sleep, and it seemed to work. At least, he didn't wake me by roaming around the apartment. No, he woke me in an entirely new way. I'm in the middle of a very pleasant dream when I suddenly wake to the sound of panicked moans. After leveraging myself out of bed, I abandon any ideas of putting on my sling and instead just walk to Eddie's room with my arm held close to my chest. With the dim light flooding in from the hallway, I can see Eddie's trapped in some sort of nightmare. He's grunting and shaking his head and twisting his face into a mask of pain. I can't just abandon him to the dream. I sit down on the edge of the bed and shake his shoulder with my good hand. In an instant, he's awake. He sees me, yells, \"No!\", and reaches under his pillow. Then his body snaps up, and his hand swings out from under the pillow and towards my head. I instinctively lean back, but it doesn't make any difference. His hand doesn't hit me. It stops inches away, and I'm face to muzzle with a loaded gun. ********** See part fifteen.[Chapter 15] Home Construction, Soul Repair - Part Fifteen by Khaki For disclaimers, etc., see part one. Author's Note: Thanks ever so muchly to Maya for giving me her insights on NY real estate. ********** POV: Eddie I can't believe they're kicking Jane out of the hospital so quickly. It hasn't even been two days since she had major surgery on her hand, not four days since she almost died, and they're sending her back to where it all happened? When Dr. Roberts cleared Jane to be discharged this afternoon, I followed him into the hallway. There, I asked him what the hell he was thinking. Jane could barely walk without help. How could he let her check out so early? He answered, \"Her legs are unharmed. She's just unstable because she's been lying on her back for several days. We'll have her sit up for the rest of the day and try walking a few more times.\" \"But...\" \"She has healed well from the surgery. There's no sign of complications. I have no reason to keep her here.\" When I saw he wasn't going to budge on his opinion, I thanked him and walked back into Jane's room. \"Eddie?\" \"I have to go,\" I answered. \"Liz'll be here soon, and I'll be back. Don't worry.\" Now that I'm faced with the reality of Jane returning to the apartment, I have to get it ready. Last I saw it, there was still blood on the floor. Plus, at least one of the guys that hurt Jane's still out there and the cops haven't got a clue who he is. They even think he might be someone who lives in or is familiar with the building. I can't let her return without making certain that our apartment's secure. When I get there, I've got to talk to the super and get some new locks on our door. Oh, and on the way home, I have to buy some new locks for the windows. I don't think I'll be able to take off the old ones, but there must be some sort of attachment I can get to secure them better. And alarm systems. I'll have to check out the cost of alarms. Neither of us has a job, and they can be pricey, but my savings should cover it. We should get a dog, too. A big guard dog. maybe one of those killer rottweilers. That reminds me, where'd I put my gun? I bought it years ago. Is it still in my closet? No, wait, Becca didn't like it so I hid it in the cupboard behind the condensed milk. I'll have to buy a box of .38 bullets today and move it back into my room. ----- The door to our apartment's open when I reach it, and I can hear someone moving around inside. I'm immediately on guard, but when I reach the threshold, I can see Victor, the super. He and another guy are pulling out the nails I'd hammered into Jane's privacy blanket. Dammit! I'd completely forgotten about him. Of course, he'd want to check out any damage caused during the burglary. Of course, he'd see what I'd done to the wall after Becca left me. I'd been lucky to keep him out of the apartment all this time, but now he knows. The guy he has with him is a few inches shy of my height, but Victor's shorter and heavier. He's standing on a chair to get at the nails on his side. It's when he grabs onto the chairback to get down that he sees me. \"Alden, how the hell did this happen, and don't tell me the burglars stopped to bash down your wall and cover the hole with a blanket.\" \"Listen, Victor, I'll fix it.\" \"The hell you will. This is Dan,\" he says, indicating the man who'd been helping him. \"He's contracted to fix this damage, and guess who's gonna pay him.\" I let out a sigh. \"Me.\" \"You're damn well right. You're lucky this isn't a weight-bearing wall.\" \"Look, Victor. Money's tight right now, what with Jane...\" \"It's only because I feel bad for that girl of yours that you aren't getting evicted. Count your blessings, pay Dan the deposit he's asking, and I'll give you your new set of keys.\" \"You changed the locks?\" \"Yep, and got the floors cleaned and Dan'll fix that big dent in the bedroom wall. My insurance'll cover what the burglars did to the apartment, but as for your stuff, I hope you have renter's insurance.\" I nod. I've got insurance, just have to find the papers so I can file a claim on what was taken. \"Well, then that's settled.\" After a pause, he turns to the other man. \"Dan?\" Dan hands me an invoice. Two hundred dollars down and who knows how much it'll be once he's done. I guess an alarm system's going to have to wait. I pull out my wallet and write him a check. \"Jane's coming home from the hospital today. When are you going to start working? Will we have to leave?\" Dan shakes his head. \"Can't get started today. I'll come back Monday morning. And you shouldn't have to move out, but you might wanna move Jane into your room until I'm done.\" He holds out his hand and I give him the check. Then, Victor gives me the keys, and both he and Dan leave. ----- The blood came out of the couch and ottoman with a lot of soap and scrubbing, but the wood on the entertainment center's cabinets had seemingly soaked the blood into the grain, and the stain wouldn't come off no matter how hard I worked at it. I sat on the floor in front of the last evidence of my murderous actions, guilty, disgusted, frustrated, but most of all, angry. I was furious at the man who'd tried to take everything from me that night. Who, with the stubbornness of his blood, was still trying to rob me of any illusion of a safe home. I had to get rid of it, but it wouldn't come off. Eventually, I just grabbed the cabinet door itself and pulled, grunting and yelling in my rage. The door broke at the hinges, leaving pieces of wood behind. I stood up, ran to the window, and threw the door in the general direction of the dumpster with a roar of triumph. That felt good, and when I walked back to the entertainment center and looked at my handiwork, well, it had gotten rid of some of the stains. The TV and the top shelves didn't have doors covering them, so why not get rid of the doors covering the bottom shelves, too? I went and found my tool kit before returning to work, unscrewing the hinges and removing the rest of the doors. That done, I walked over to Jane's room. Her belongings were still in disarray from the burglary, but they all seemed to be there. I spent the next hour putting everything back into the places I remembered it and tidying up. Then, I spent the rest of the time I had installing new window locks throughout the apartment, cleaning, and putting everything back as it had been before, or at least as close to it as I could get. ----- I can't do this. It was hard enough being in the apartment with Jane in the hospital, but now, with her here, I'm terrified something's going to happen to her. I can't help checking the locks every few hours even though I know for a fact I've checked them before and they've always been ok. Still, I can't help thinking that if I stop checking there might be one I've missed and whoever was here before will use it to get in and hurt Jane. Even then, even if everything's locked up, they got in before, didn't they? The police didn't see any sign of forced entry. Some of the windows were unlocked, and they could've gotten in from the fire escape, but what if they didn't? Also, what if even with everything locked up, they break their way in? We can't afford an alarm system. If I'm not awake, they could come in and kill Jane, and I wouldn't even know about it. I wish we could move out, but even if I had a job, leaving behind a rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan would be insane. I've felt this way before, when Becca left me. I just knocked down the wall, brought home all sorts of nameless one-night stands, maybe drank a little too much while I was in the apartment, but I didn't move. In fact, I want a drink right now. It's been days since I've had anything stronger than coffee, but I just can't. What if I do and I fall asleep? I'll leave Jane unprotected. In fact, I've barely slept in days, and when I have, it's on the couch in the main room with my gun hidden under a pillow at my side, no further than an arm's length away. I'd rather sleep in a chair in Jane's room, but she says it keeps her from sleeping so this is the best I can do. If someone comes through the door or one of the windows, I'll be ready. \"Eddie?\" I turn around to see Jane standing in the hallway between our two rooms. I'm on my feet and walking towards her in seconds. \"Jane, you shouldn't be up? What's the matter? What do you need?\" She just stands there and looks me up and down before saying, \"How long has it been since you've slept?\" \"Last night.\" \"No,\" she says, meeting my eyes with a concerned expression. \"Really slept. A full eight hours.\" I look down and run one hand through my hair. \"You know me. Sometimes I just can't sleep.\" \"Eddie, you look terrible.\" That's my Jane. We've never been anything but honest to each other. She continues, \"I have some sleeping pills. Would you like...\" \"No, I'm fine. Really. I was just getting into this book.\" I look over towards the couch, trying to see what book I'd been leafing through. \"And I can't stop until I at least finish the chapter.\" \"That can wait until tomorrow,\" Jane says, grabbing hold of my arm with her uninjured hand and turning me towards my room. \"Tonight you need a nice, long sleep in your own bed.\" \"But, Jane, I...\" \"Eddie, I am not spending another night listening to you wander around the apartment. If you don't lie down, I'm gonna lock you in there and make you lie down, I swear.\" \"Ok, ok,\" I answer, holding up my hands in surrender. \"Just let me get my book.\" She frowns at me and I add, \"It'll help me fall asleep.\" I walk back to the couch, picking up the book and my gun, using the book to hide it. Then, I walk back towards Jane and turn into my room. \"Goodnight,\" she says. \"'Night... Are you sure there's nothing I can do for you?\" \"I'm fine, Eddie. I'm going back to bed now. You get some sleep, ok?\" \"'k.\" ----- I fell asleep. I didn't mean to, but just lying down made all the stress in my body just drain away. The nightmare returned. One of many that've been bothering me since the attack. Just another reason why I've avoided sleeping. They returned, men surrounded by darkness so I couldn't see who they were. They'd tied me up and now were hurting Jane right in front of me. I struggled, but I couldn't stop them. Couldn't do anything to help her. I felt a hand on my shoulder and I startled awake, only to see another dark figure hovering over me. I'd stop them this time, wouldn't let them tie me up, wouldn't let them get to Jane. I reached under my pillow, retrieved my gun, and aimed it at the head of the shadowy figure. Then, I pulled the trigger. ********** TBC.

Heart-stricken over the \"Old Bull Gone To Greener Pastures\" - if you will - I wrote a column for a men's magazine to please my best friend. Little did I know that it would become the hottest topic this side of the barnyard fence. And little did I know that in the midst of this propaganda sucking article, lay a key, a key which unlocked the truth, the truth that not all men were back-stabbing morons, only some of them. And to this truth, I found love in the very last place I would ever want to look… *********** CHAPTER I - Welcome To Heaven, Please Take A Number And We Will Be With You In A Moment \"Where is he?!\" Jane Goodale screamed into the man's face, her fiery eyes burning deep into his head as if his mind would tell her faster than his lips. \"Who?\" The man choked out of his constricted throat, having trouble speaking through the iron grip on his smock collar, the little woman nearly lifting him off the ground. \"Eddie Alden. Where is he?\" Her eyes burned with anger, but tears glazed them over, worry utterly apparent. \"I…I don't know ma'am, you'll have to ask the receptionist…\" The airborne doctor said as she threw him to the ground and out of the way, her high heels clicking roughly across the gleaming floor as she made a direct line to the reception desk, god help those who were in her way. \"Excuse me,\" she spat out coldly, even before the large, black receptionist looked up from her computer screen. \"You have to tell me where Eddie Alden is.\" Jane began to shift her weight from one foot to another in impatience, her fingernails clicking nervously on the reception desk. \"Who?\" The large woman said slowly, looking up at her from behind a pair of square rimmed glasses that looked almost perfect to her reception-motifed clothing with the flowery undershirt and knit jacket. \"Eddie Alden, he's about six-foot-three, has dark, short hair. He was brought in about thirty minutes ago.\" Jane said quickly, her grasp on her slippery patience slipping that much more. \"May I ask who you are?\" The black receptionist said even more slowly, idly sliding her glasses from her face as she squinted up at Jane with beady eyes hidden beneath folds of skin. \"I'm his fiancée!\" Jane said hurriedly, her teeth grinding with rage in the back of her jaw. Suddenly, the dark woman's face turned to amazement as she leaned back in her large, padded chair. \"Hey, aren't you that lady?-\" She began, but was suddenly cut off. \"Yes! I'm that lady! The one on the fucking Diana Robert's Show who made up the stupid Cow Theory! Now can I please find out where my fucking fiancé is or do I have to find him my fucking self?!\" She screamed, tears streaming down her face freely. Jane ignored the few turned heads as she watched the large receptionist recoil back in her chair and think twice to sink back and hide in her rolls. \"It will be just a moment.\" The receptionist said when she finally spoke, immediately dislodging her gaze from Jane's blazing eyes and switching them to her computer screen, her fingers erratic over the keyboard. Jane sighed, pushing back her anger as she turned and leaned the small of her back against the lip of the desk, connecting gazes with one of the astonished pedestrians who had happened to walk by in the midst of her screaming. \"What are you looking at?\" Jane hissed, smiling callously as the woman suddenly looked even more shocked, as if she were staring into the face of the devil, and immediately dropped her eyes and walked hurriedly away. \"Um, Miss Alden?\" The receptionist caught her attention at the new name, and she immediately spun on her heel. \"What?\" \"Mr. Alden is still in surgery.\" The woman murmured. \"Where?\" Jane leaned over the desk, putting her tear-streaked face inches from the woman and looking deeply into her dark eyes. \"Fi-Fifth Floor, right across from the elevator.\" The woman murmured again, her voice restricted. \"Thank you.\" Jane called over her shoulder as she sped off to the elevator, barely avoiding colliding with people who were unfortunate enough to cross paths with her. After a walk that had seemed too long, she finally reached the elevator and crammed herself in with a whole bunch of other people. Her feet shifted nervously beneath her as the elevator seemed to crawl from one floor to the next, an eternity until the doors binged open and she squeezed out of the packed elevator, her body shaking uncontrollably. She made another straight line for the doors across the hall marked: Operating Room Hospital Personnel Only Ignoring the stenciled forbiddance, she pushed roughly through the doors and stomped swiftly down the hall, her hands clenched into fists at her sides. As she turned a corner, she nearly knocked over a blue garbed doctor with excessive amounts of blood coating his smock and his upheld rubber gloves. \"Woah!\" The man beamed, carefully avoiding getting blood onto Jane's business suit. Shimmering green eyes peeked out from between a white mouth cover and his blue shower cap. \"Where do you think you're going?\" \"Is Eddie Alden in there?\" She choked out, ninety-nine percent sure that he was, yet ninety-nine percent regretting that she had asked. \"The guy who got hit by the car?\" The doctor asked unwaveringly, carefully keeping his bloody self between Jane and the Operating Room doors. He didn't see her eyes harden at his apathetic words, or else he gave no sign of it. \"A tall guy? With short black hair?\" He described as if he were describing a lost dog. \"Yes!\" Jane hissed, all patience slipping out from beneath her feet, and she could feel herself falling. \"There were some complications, he's got massive internal bleeding and we had to remove his spleen, it's going to be a while till he's back together again.\" He said matter-of-factly, his eyes seeming to smile. Jane stumbled back as if she had just been hit in the face with a bag of bricks, her breath becoming dangerously shallow and her eyesight turning fuzzy. She stumbled to regain her balance as she raised a shaking hand to her head, trying unsuccessfully to regain her composure. \"Bu-? Wha-? How?…\" She stuttered. \"Miss? Are you alright?\" Was the last thing she heard before she lost it and watched herself slowly fall to the floor in silence, darkness closing in around her.[Chapter 2] CHAPTER II Would You Like Dinner On An Intravenous Line Or Would You Prefer It Through A Straw? Jane moaned as she was brought back to consciousness by a jumble of beeping and whirring and humming. Slowly, she opened her eyes, taking in the pasty colored walls and the shock of frizzy black hair and dark, beautiful eyes above her. \"Morning sunshine.\" The face said quietly, their eyes sparkling with compassion as Jane forced herself from the comforting blackness. \"Liz.\" Jane choked out as she sat up and wrapped her arms around her friend's neck, sucking in all the comfort she could get. Tears pushed forward in her eyes, and Jane sucked down the urge to weep again. With a sniff, Jane pulled back and wiped her eyes with her hand, managing a smile to comply with her friend's worried face. She sat there for a moment, looking inside Liz's eyes and wallowing in the sadness. \"I'm so sorry,\" Liz said sympathetically, frowning. Jane nodded and sat back, finally noticing that she was lying in a hospital bed with the curtain pulled up around it. \"Where's Eddie?\" Jane suddenly asked, franticness leaping into her eyes and words as she sat up and began to stand up from the bed, but Liz put a comforting hand on her shoulder, squeezing it gently. \"Calm down, Jane.\" Liz said, more of a pleading sense than a command. \"You'll wake him up.\" Liz stood and helped her friend out of the bed, walking over to the curtain and gently pulling it away, revealing what made Jane stiffen. A powerful wave of melancholy washing over her. \"Oh my god…\" Was all she could get out beneath her fingers that were now placed across her lips, her eyes wide. Eddie looked almost lifeless beneath the blankets piled on top of him, his pallor matching that of the pasty walls. He looked so delicate without the warm red flowing beneath his skin that she was reluctant to walk toward the bed, as if he might crumble at any moment. From the bulge beneath the blankets, Jane could tell that his left arm was wrapped in a cast, clamped across his chest. His right arm lay slack beside him, IV's and other lines snaking in and out of it. An air hose was pushed up into his nose and a whole bunch of computer junk was piled around his head. He looked so strange, as if he were more a robot than her fiancé: Eddie Alden. She silently made her way forward, her feet sliding over the tiled floor with each seemingly heavy footstep. Her breath falling short as she gently took hold of his limp grasp, welcoming his touch with a burdensome heart. Jane jumped as she felt Eddie's loose fingers tighten slightly around her spidery hand, a small moan issuing from his lips as he collapsed back into the bed. She watched as his eyes barely fluttered open, tiny slits only revealing a fraction of the deep, beautiful, brown world that lay beneath. Eddie managed a small smile as his tongue flashed out lamely to moisten his dry lips, and he gently lifted Jane's hand to his face, kissing it lightly. Jane smiled, ignoring the loose tears now trailing her cheek. \"Hey,\" Eddie whispered, his voice low and husky as his eyes slid shut again. \"Hi,\" Jane answered, she turned to Liz in desperation, who had slunk off into a corner and had her arms wrapped about herself, surveying Jane's actions. Liz only shook her head and shrugged, her eyes flashing from Eddie's limp form, to Jane's pleading eyes, to the ground. \"I'll be outside,\" Liz smiled politely and pushed back the tears in her eyes, walking out the door. \"Get well, Eddie.\" She said over her shoulder. Jane half-heartedly watched as her friend slid out of the door, leaving her standing in the middle of a room with a broken man clasped to her fingers. \"Oh Eddie,\" Jane murmured, watching his lamed and pained efforts as he tried to scooch over in the bed. \"Come here,\" Eddie whispered, his eyes lazily appearing again as he lifted his chin, beckoning her to come in. Jane faltered a moment, thinking over the action before sliding carefully into the bed with him, freaking when he took a sharp breath because of a shock of pain. After positioning herself as comfortably as possible without further disturbing Eddie, Jane rested her head between his shoulder and chin, listening to his heavy breathing. \"I've missed you,\" Eddie said, snuggling closer to Jane as he felt her tremble with sadness against him, his paper hospital gown shifting noisily. An edgy tranquility washed over her as his neck vibrated with his deep voice, seeming to massage her fevered skin. Jane cinched her eyes closed, but it was already too late, tears slipped down the bridge of her nose and dripped loose onto his shoulder. \"I was so scared,\" Jane whimpered, sniffing back more tears as she lifted her hand to wrap a loose arch around his neck, avoiding his broken arm as she snuggled closer to his body, feeding off his warmth. \"What happened?\" \"I don't really remember,\" Eddie sank back into the pillows, his voice still husky, his vocal chords seeming to be strings of granite. \"I was just walking across the street, and this car came out of nowhere, and took me off my feet. And the next thing I remember is lying on the ground with a whole bunch of people standing around me, just staring…\" Jane suddenly noticed that goosebumps had erupted across his arms and he was shivering slightly. Her eyebrows stitched as she felt him go limp in her arms, succumbing to the exhaustion that ravaged his body. Jane gently slipped her head from his shoulder and scooted up so her nose was an inch apart from his and looked directly into his closed eyes. She watched him for a second, noticing things, the curve of his nose, his slightly darkened eyes, the shape of his eyebrows, and the little bit of stubble growing across his chin, things she had never taken time to notice. \"Welcome back,\" Jane whispered almost silently, gently pushing her head forward and delicately pecking the tip of his nose with her lips, letting a light smack of moist skin carry her away to darkness.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER III My Baby Is Busy Wearing A Neck Brace Rather Than His Angel Wings Today Everything seemed to bow into slow motion, the headlights flickered as if taunting him, the screaming brakes seemed to laugh with perverted joy, and the metal bumper shimmered cruelly in the bare light of the empty New York street, before taking him out. He couldn't move at all, as if his feet were glued to the asphalt, and all he could do was stare out in horror. As soon as the shimmering bumper hit his knees, he knew he was a dead man. He could feel his knees bend backwards, his bones brushing past each other, in the wrong directions. He could only cry out as the force sent him flying across the street, and the only thing he could do was swing his flailing arm out in front of him as he came headfirst into the sidewalk. His vision exploded into silver light that surpassed the word beauty. But he didn't have time to admire it because a half-second later there was the hollow crack of bones and an immense pain rang throughout his body. His throat echoed the pain, emitting it into an agonizing scream that almost deafened the agony of his mind. And through his world of torturing pain and silver light, he could feel himself falling, into nothing, and blackness overtook him… \"JANE!\" Eddie snapped straight up in the bed in a panic, his movements suddenly cauterized by a freight train of pain that boiled though every nerve in his body. \"Eddie!\" Jane immediately snapped from the fuzziness of the sleep, awakened by her fiancé's scream. \"Eddie! Eddie, calm down! Eddie, it's okay, I'm here! Oh god! Eddie! Talk to me!\" Jane was frantic, her arms like lead weights at her side as her mind and mouth screamed frantically to make him stop. She watched him fall back into the pillows, sweat and tears running down his face with his jaw clenched tight and his eyes cinched. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end, tears burning up from her throat as she watched him begin to convulse with small, spastic jerks, sweat still dripping off him. \"Eddie. Eddie baby, talk to me. Tell me where it hurts.\" Jane tried, finally lifting her deadweight arms from her sides and placing them gently on the sides of his face, holding his head still. Soon, his body followed his head's command and the only thing left was sweat soaked sheets and his heavy, hitched breathing that now resonated throughout the room. \"Eddie? Can you talk to me? Tell me something.\" Jane pleaded, tears streaming her cheeks as she bent over and frantically kissed all the soft places on his face she could reach, as if he might disappear at any moment. His shallow breathing only stopped inconsistently when he went to swallow back another cry, forcing it like bile down his throat. He was shivering slightly, his eyes still closed and his mouth still clenched shut. \"Eddie, come on baby,\" Jane cooed as she regained the broken pieces of her sanity and slipped her finger between his lips, seeking out a weakness at which to open his jaws. Within a few seconds, he gave her the opportunity and she pushed a pencil between his teeth, one that had been sitting on the bedside table next to her, which already had teeth marks etched into it from previous nights. He lay with tears still streaming down his face, his face twisted into an agonizing demeanor. All color had washed from his face, only his cheeks were flushed with the brilliance of blood flowing beneath his skin. Jane took her hand and gently began to wipe away the sweat from his face, wiping it carelessly onto her long tee shirt. It had been only five days since Eddie had been able to come home without the assistance of a nurse, and the nightmares were already pluming. Almost every night they would come, haunting him, attacking him when either of them least expected it. Flowers, presents, and get-well cards had come by the dozens, and were all stacked out in the living room. Most of them were from coworkers from the Diana Robert's Show. But there were some from Jane's friends, and even Ray Brown sent Eddie a card, which, Jane threatened to throw away, with the disapproval of Eddie. Jane waited until Eddie's jaws finally relaxed and the pencil rolled limply out from between his lips, before she moved again. She gently rolled up and placed her hands above his shoulders, supported over his silent frame and looking into his closed face. \"Are you alright?\" Jane whispered, carefully watching his face for any fraction of anything as he sighed lightly and nodded. She cocked her head to the side as she watched him still shivering slightly, goosebumps breaking out across his skin. \"Are you sure?\" She asked one more time, gently rolling back beside him and tucking the covers around his shaking frame, leaning in close to him and holding her head an fraction of an inch away from the top of his shoulder, letting it hover. He nodded, cringing slightly as he tried to push himself stiffly up so that he was sitting vertical, but managed something short of a slanted, laying position and allowed Jane to crawl into his lap, her ear against his chest. They lay there in silence for a few seconds, Jane listening to the heavy thumps of his heart and gently rubbing her fingers up and down his arm, her fingertips dancing over the elevated veins in his arm. \"You're still shaking,\" Jane mentioned inconsequentially, as if her comment would give her a rash explanation for it. \"It'll stop,\" Eddie mentioned in a hollow voice, his throat burning with bile and tears and the skeletons of dead screams. \"Was it the same dream?\" She asked, gently running her fingernails lightly up his arm and across his collarbone before following his bone and veins back down again. He nodded lightly, as he shifted his head down to rest his chin against the top of her head, taking in her vanilla smell. His eyes fluttered open as he felt something hot and moist slide onto his chest, and he realized it was a tear. \"Jane? Why are you crying?\" He asked, shifting out from beneath her while she still lay on her side. He turned his head to the side and sought out her dainty hand beneath the covers, intertwining their fingers like they use to do. \"I was scared,\" Jane managed a smile through her tears, her chin shaking with trapped sobs as he pulled her in again against his collar bone, nuzzling her with his head. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.\" Eddie admitted, closing his eyes and leaning down his head to kiss her softly on the top of the head. \"I love you,\" He whispered, like a little, embarrassed child would to another embarrassed child. \"I love you too.\"[Chapter 4] CHAPTER IV Are You Going To Come Quietly Or Do I Have To Use Earplugs? \"Look Jane,\" Eddie hobbled miserably to the couch in the spacious living room and dropped himself with a heavy sigh, allowing the crutches to slide to the floor. \"I don't need one.\" Jane was behind the counter in the connecting kitchen, her chin propped up on her elbows, her eyes staring blankly into his lying face. She was twirling her engagement ring obliviously around her finger, chewing on her tongue. \"It's all bullshit. I don't buy into it.\" Eddie threw up his good hand in surrender - his other one slung in a cast, and deadweight against his chest - and turned away from Jane, staring blankly at the floor. \"You wanna to know what's bullshit?\" Jane asked, pounding her elbows on the countertop to get his attention before continuing. \"You. You're just too damn proud to admit that you need help. That's what's bullshit.\" Jane flipped her hair from her face angrily. \"Me?\" Eddie quipped, his hand pivoting to face his chest. \"I'm not the one who's going insane over some recurring nightmare and saying I should go to some tight-assed, egotistically absorbed bitch and spill my guts out.\" Eddie was about to rise, but thought against it. \"You know,\" Jane's hand tightened into a rigid grip in front of her as if she was holding a ball, but there was no ball. \"The problem is that you're so wrapped up in yourself that you're cutting off everything else in the world.\" \"Case in point.\" Eddie gestured loosely with his fingers before rubbing his hand up and down his face in annoyance. He tried to make it appear as if he was just resting due to exhaustion, but it was really to hide from Jane's reactions. Jane's jaw hung open as she tried to think something intelligent up, but she could find none, instead she surrendered. \"Fine! If you want to wake up every morning screaming and welcoming yourself into a world of pain, go right he hell for it. Otherwise; I'm going for a walk.\" \"Good!\" Eddie retorted, watching her as she stomped across the room and grabbed her coat from the coat rack near the door before flipping around to face him. \"Fine!\" She yelled back, slamming the door behind her. Eddie sat there a moment, the sound of the rain slapping against the apartment windows filling the emptiness now engulfing the room. He sighed heavily before sinking to the side of the couch, resting his head on the armrest and closing his eyes. *MOO* \"I just don't understand. Why is he so insensate?\" Jane asked pitifully, shifting her salad indifferently around on her plate with her fork. She sat moping over her dinner that she had suddenly scheduled with Liz. \"It's obvious,\" Liz said, popping an olive into her mouth impolitely while she was talking. \"He's a man. Men have to act tough.\" She shrugged her shoulders and looked back down to her plate, fishing out another olive from her salad. \"I know, it's just…\" Jane tried, but gave up, shaking her head at the hopelessness of it. \"Look babe,\" Liz's hands snapped in execution. \"He'll get over it. You'll break him down. Remember…\" She began, and Jane automatically finished. \"Time wounds all heals.\" Jane smiled half-heartedly as Liz giggled, going back to her food. \"God. You never have enough olives when you need them.\" Liz tried keenly to change the subject, but Jane was use to it and she did not surrender. Jane simply pushed her plate out of the way and dropped her head onto the table, sighing loudly. The waiter came and gave them the check before leaving in a huff to clean up a mess someone had left on another table. \"Don't beat yourself up over it.\" Liz tried, gently placing her hand on her friend's tightly coiled shoulder, squeezing gently. \"It's just repercussions, you know, like…like…\" Liz tried to think fast. Her eyes grew wide as an idea came to her and she pointed her finger at Jane, \"like, when Ray broke up with you and you kept having those bouts of depression.\" Liz nodded as though she's just won Double Jeopardy, wiping her hands on her napkin. \"What?\" Jane rose from the confinements of her arms in confusion. \"That's nothing like this,\" Jane pouted, taking an apathetic sip from her water. \"Whatever,\" she waved her hand as if the idea would disappear behind her shoulder and got up and grabbed her damp coat, taking Jane by the wrist and helping her to her feet. \"Come on.\" \"Where are we going?\" Jane asked lazily, watching as Liz threw down some money on the table and grabbed her car keys before leading Jane away. \"I'm going to buy you a drink.\" *MOO* Eddie was sprawled lazily across the back of the couch, his head back and his good arm and leg stretched as far as they could. His eyes were shut and only the sound of the rain and his breathing filled his ears. With a dispassionate sigh, Eddie sat up from his lolled position and bent down to reach for his crutch, cringing as a pain burst through his side, and he sat back up, easing the pain. He sighed as he lifted the bottom of his shirt, revealing a long, pink scar that ran diagonally across his belly, a yellow and purple bruise encasing it. He pushed gingerly at the soft tissue, taking a sharp breath at the spurt of pain. He ran a hand through his hair, his breath speeding up as memories came back to him. The headlights… The brakes… The sounds… The smells… The pain… The people… Crowding… Standing… Staring… \"No!\" He pushed away their eyes from his mind, coming to grips with the fact he was sitting safely in his apartment living room, four stories above the street. Slowly, he relaxed his breath and wiped the collected sweat from his forehead, blinking the horrid images from his head. Shaking his head at himself, he bent to retrieve his crutch, ignoring the pain. He slowly pushed himself unsteadily to his feet, positioning his crutch comfortably beneath his arm as he hobbled across the room to the counter and positioned himself halfway onto one of the barstools. He reached out and grabbed the phonebook, then pulled the phone into his reach and began flipping through the phonebook, scanning his finger down as her got to the right page and found what he was looking for. Without a second thought, Eddie dialed in the number and waited until someone picked up, then he froze, lost in thought. The continual shriek of the disconnected line brought him back as he shook back to reality. A cold sweat broke out across his body as he shook the absurdity of his thought from his mind and pressed redial. \"Hello? Yes, I'd like to make an appointment with a Dr. Summers.\"[Chapter 5] CHAPTER V Never Go To A Doctor Whose Office Plants Have Died \"Mr. Alden?\" A squatty receptionist peeked over desk, facing Eddie who sat as casually as he could in the waiting room chair with half of his body still broken. He looked up reluctantly from an article he was pretending to read from one of the outdated magazines and regretting his response to the words coming. \"Dr. Summers will see you now.\" The receptionist smiled a huge, toothy grin as Eddie pushed himself casually up from the consuming chair and snatched up his crutch. He tried to pace himself as he stumbled into the doors of hell, his heart immediately lodging itself into his throat. Eddie took a deep breath and held it, hoping he could somehow disappear, but it didn't happen. Instead, he looked about the room, noticing the dark red wallpaper and the black leather couch along the back wall. A big, open faced window looked out over varying sizes of buildings of New York and seemed to swallow up the sunlight. A few black and white pictures hung about the walls, coupled with a diploma and a synthetic plant sitting bleakly in the corner. Eddie jumped as someone in the room cleared their throat, and he turned to face a woman staring quietly at him from her desk in a puffy chair adjacent to the couch. Her red hair was slicked back against her head, a ponytail flowing out behind and brushing her shoulders with various curling tendrils. Her face came to smooth points and she looked at him from above a pair of black, square-rimmed glasses. A notebook and pen sat readily in her lap and Eddie couldn't help but let his eyes linger down the sleek shape of her crossed legs. He opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out, instead the woman rose to her feet and pushed her glasses back up in front of her eyes. \"Doctor Rachel Summers.\" She smiled, holding out her hand. Eddie stood frozen, his mouth still hanging open and his body rigid. Then he realized what was going on. \"Uh, Eddie Alden…\" He said blankly, nodding his head toward her hand then motioning toward his crutch, hinting his dilemma. \"Oh yes, I see.\" She pulled her hand back - unscathed and dignity still intact - and instead motioned to the sofa lying against the wall. \"Please, have a seat.\" She waited until Eddie was as comfortable as he could get before she sat down herself. Eddie fidgeted as nonchalantly as he could, his eyes scanning the walls at things he'd already seen upon entering. He scratched his head and looked back to Dr. Summers, smiling back in kind when she smiled. Then she sighed. \"Okay, well, let's start off by my asking you why you're here.\" Dr. Summers sat back in her chair, and Eddie knew things were starting to get warmed up. He casually wiped the sweat from his palms onto his pants and sat back as much as he could. \"I don't really know,\" He lied, gloating his lie by pasting on an embarrassed smile. \"Then you're just here to regard my office?\" The light-hearted joke hung heavy in the room as both of them smiled, but neither chose to follow it. Eddie turned away from her and chewed on his lip, jumping slightly at the groan of moving leather, and he spun to face Dr. Summers again. She was sitting forward slightly with her hands clasp on her lap and her eyes burrowing into his head. \"I want you to feel as comfortable as you can Eddie. Try to relax.\" He hesitated, before letting out his breath slowly and clearing his throat and just staring at her. \"Is that relaxed?\" She smirked. \"As much as I can push it.\" He smiled politely and tore away from her gaze. Her face suddenly fell into empathy and she eased back, her leather chair groaning again at her movements. \"Oh really?\" A faint line formed between her eyes as her eyebrows stitched. \"Hence, the crutch.\" Eddie commented with a polite smile as her face switched into understanding. She turned to face her notebook and scribbled something on it before looking back up to him with an odd sense of emptiness in her eyes. \"May I ask what caused your injuries?\" Her green eyes seemed to shimmer eerily in the lights and Eddie felt a chill run down his spine. \"Uh,\" Eddie's voice fell flat. \"Everything you say in this room is completely confidential, nothing ever leaves this room.\" She suddenly spoke as if he was about to tell her an enormous secret, but he just couldn't find his voice. He smiled again and gently stroked his finger nervously over the scar on his belly over his shirt, trying to look as nonchalant as he possibly could. \"I had an acc…incident…\" Eddie could feel the control of his mind and words slipping out from beneath him, and he felt himself fall into her power defenselessly. \"Tell me about the incident.\" Dr. Summers said smoothly. Her brilliant green eyes seemed to soften when he looked into them and he couldn't help but to tell her. \"…I…it…\"He closed his eyes and tried to picture it in his mind then translate it into words. \"What specifics do you remember?\" Dr. Summers had a way to control her words so that they sounded more like a coax than an interrogation. \"…I was just walking across the street, and it was dark…\" Eddie pushed back the panic now rising in his body as reenactments flashed across his mind. \"And this car, from out of nowhere, came from the dark…and…I couldn't move, so I just stood there…and watched it come toward me…\" Sweat broke out across his brow and his body tightened like a coiled spring as he pulled in his arms and legs. \"It's alright Eddie, don't try to hold the memories back, let them come, they can't hurt you.\" Dr. Summers pushed lightly. \"What else to you remember?\" \"I remember standing there, just watching as the car came at me. And then I remember it taking my legs out from under me, and then I was flying through the air and then landing on the sidewalk.\" Eddie was now wringing his hands nervously and rocking back and forth on the couch. \"Then there were these people, and they were just standing over me, just staring. And there was something about their faces…\" Eddie suddenly fell silent, his eyes still closed. \"What about their faces? Tell me about their faces Eddie.\" Dr. Summers laid a hand onto his knee, and he opened his eyes only to turn away from her, embarrassed. \"I can't help if you won't tell me. Please, I'm here, there's nothing to be afraid of.\" Dr. Summers spoke with the kindness of a mother. \"The faces. They were them.\" \"Who are them?\" \"All the women. The one's I have dumped. They were standing over me, just staring with cold eyes.\" An icy sweat had broken out across the rest of Eddie's skin and he could feel goosebumps forming along his arms and legs. He swore that he could feel his core temperature plummet to a flat line ninety point nothing, and all he could do was keep talking and rocking and shivering. \"Was there anything else significant about the accident?\" Dr. Summers took into account that he was convulsing and gently eased him back onto the couch, draping a blanket over him as he continued. \"The driver…of the car that hit me…\" \"Yes?\" \"It was 'becca.\" \"Who's 'becca?\" \"Rebecca was my girlfriend, before I met Jane. I thought she was the one I was going to be with forever.\" \"Tell me about 'becca.\" Dr. Summers used the name that he was customary to and immediately noticed that the change of topic seemed to have a calming effect on Eddie. \"She was beautiful. She had long, red hair and vivid eyes that just stared at you and made you go weak. She worked as a nurse, and we got our first apartment together. But then, all of a sudden, she drifted.\" \"What do you mean 'drifted'?\" Dr. Summers jotted a few more noted down onto her notebook before looking back up to Eddie, who had casually flung his good arm over his eyes. \"I just woke up one morning, and instead of her lying next to me…there was a note…\" \"What did the note say?\" \"Something along the lines of 'I'm getting bored, I think we should find different people.'\" He sniffed and shifted himself so he was more comfortable. \"And so, we never met again, and I took up a job at the Diana Robert's Show and kept searching for the perfect women, the one to fill the gap that 'becca left.\"[Chapter 6] CHAPTER VI It Is Not The Fall That Kills You. It Is - In Fact - The Impact. \"Eddie?\" Jane called into the apartment with no answer, her voice reverberating off the empty walls. She settled the grocery bag onto the counter and quickly put away the perishables before going off to find her fiancé. \"Eddie baby, are you alive?\" She joked, looking into their bedroom and finding no half-broken man. Then, suddenly, she felt something wet and smooth drift across her shins and she looked down to find a warm fog sweeping past her legs. She was puzzled until she followed the fog's escape through the bottom door of the bathroom, and a shadow of a sleek smile tripped across her face. Ever so delicately, she turned the knob and peeked into the bathroom, momentarily averted as a rush of white, warm, wet steam plumed into the cold hallway. As soon as the wall of steam had dissipated, she slid between the barely opened door and it's frame, trying to keep as much steam in as she could. As silently as possible, she shut the door behind her and tiptoed across the floor, silently stripping as she went. Leaving behind a trail of clothing, she made her way to the bathtub, finally close enough to make out Eddie's dark silhouette. From what she could tell, he was bent wildly within the tub, his bad leg and arm hanging perilously from the lip so as not to get the casts wet, and his head was laid back. \"Hey baby,\" She whispered as she gently caressed her fingers along his damp shoulder, smiling at his surprise. \"Sorry,\" She said as he twisted his head back to her, cringing at the cordial movement that his body refused to do. Without a word, he slid forward in the tub as much as he possibly could and let her slide in behind him, the water rising another two inches and threatening to slosh over the sides. After both were comfortably situated, Jane allowed Eddie to rest his head back on her shoulder as she gently began to stroke his wet hair with her fingers, unintentionally forming peaked spikes with her stroking. \"I've missed you,\" Eddie whispered in a hoarse voice, and Jane guessed that she had woken him from sleeping. \"I haven't been anywhere,\" Jane mentioned, craning her head to gently kiss him on the side of his neck. She gently wrapped her left arm about his shoulders, holding onto him for comfort. \"I know, I just missed you.\" Was his empty reply. Eddie suddenly coughed and Jane held onto him as if he might vanish at any given moment, her hands sliding over his wet and fevered flesh. \"Speaking of which,\" Jane absently redirected as his coughing faded and she resumed stroking his hair. \"Where were you yesterday?\" \"What do you mean?\" He opened his eyes, but rejected the idea of turning his head to face her. \"After the fight. I came home, and you were gone.\" \"I…uh…just needed some air, that's all.\" He closed his eyes and relaxed into her body again, acting as if it was no big deal. \"You shouldn't be walking on your leg, especially with the condition you're in.\" Jane said, and she was confused at the sudden tension now rolling from his shoulders, down to his thighs and the explosion of goosebumps. \"Are you okay?\" She asked, looking into his face as it flinched. \"Yeah, I'm just cold.\" He lied. She shifted her left arm down, so that her hand trailed to his washboard stomach, her fingers dancing over the operation scar that now plagued his beautiful flesh, and a new roll of tension surged down his body. His good hand suddenly shot up to grab onto her wrist, protectively, and she knew what was going on. \"No. No, It's okay; I'm not going to hurt you baby. I promise.\" She remembered that night when she had cuddled closer to Eddie beneath the sheets to keep warm and had accidentally run her fingers over his scar, and in his sleep had accused her of being his \"attacker\". Reluctantly, he eased his grip off her wrist and she calmly began massaging it with her fingertip, the scar feeling like someone had taken a piece of sand paper and scrubbed away his skin, leaving his muscle revealed. Almost unintelligently, Jane started humming lightly, closing her eyes and relaxing into - what she noted as to be - incredibly warm water. She wondered how Eddie could be cold at all, but, whatever. The thoughts slipped from her mind, along with her slipping hand as it fell gently to rest against Eddie's thigh, and she could feel Eddie cuddle closer to her as they relaxed into each other. The absorbing sheen of the tiled walls gently digested the fading purr of an unknown song, as both drifted off into oblivion.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER VII Those Who Prefer To Be Late Will Undoubtedly Get No Fruit Cup Jane lolled back in her padded chair, her shoulder and chin securing the telephone snuggly against her ear and a yogurt covered spoon sticking out of her mouth. \"…I mean, it's not like I can't trust him.\" Jane continued, oblivious to the bustle of productiveness going on outside her corner office. The spoon muffled her words, but being her best friend on the other line, there was no complication. \"I'm not saying that.\" Liz retorted, her addiction of cigarettes getting the best of her as she slipped out a Slim and put it between her lips, cupping her hands around a lighter. \"All I'm saying is that you should watch him.\" \"Well…\" Jane's eyes glanced out the window suspiciously before rising to shut the door. \"He has been going out for walks more often than I and the doctor thinks he should…\" Jane could hear Liz's exasperated inhale on the other line and she quickly tried to recover. \"But, come on, I mean, why would he do that to me?\" Jane felt herself losing ground. \"Jane. Hello?\" Liz spoke as if Jane were an incompetent child. \"You think he would just drop all his womanizing cold turkey just because you walked into his life? No offense. But to him, women are like cigarettes, you have to leave 'em step by step.\" Jane rolled her eyes, and absently watched her busy coworkers rush by her window, occasionally turning in her direction for a nod of hello. Her mind fizzed over important subjects elsewhere. \"Jane? Jane? Are you there?\" Liz's cracking voice suddenly brought Jane back into the mad bustle of the present. \"Huh? What?\" Jane retook her mind. \"I said: 'Where is Eddie now?'\" She emphasized. Blowing smoke into the receiver as she shimmied onto the desk near the open window to allow the smoke to billow out into the already well polluted atmosphere of New York City. \"He's at home, just sleeping.\" \"Last time you checked?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well…\" She dragged out her word long enough to touch a nerve in Jane. \"'Well' what?\" Jane's eyes bulged as she tried to mimic Liz's temperance. \"Oh, I don't know, maybe you should, you know…\" Liz did terrible at acting nonchalant when something was on her mind and floating on her lips. \"Spill it.\" Jane said, looking at the clock on the wall, noting that it was about three minutes away from her sixty minute lunch break, plenty of time for Liz's coming plan. \"Okay.\" Liz's voice jumped as though she was about to tell the biggest gossip passed this side of the office cubicles. \"Why don't you make an unscheduled stop home and see if he's 'just sleeping'.\" She breathed out in mock tone. Jane huffed at the thought. \"Oh Jesus,\" she sighed, \"I appreciate the love knowledge you so idly contribute to my life, but don't you think you're crossing the line into uncharted territory?\" Liz made a naively loud sigh into the telephone and leaned over, her cigarette still burning strong between her fingers. \"Say what you want,\" She retorted, and Jane knew she was holding up her hand defensively. \"But you never know.\" With that, she hung up the phone and left Jane pining over ridiculous thoughts of Eddie's shadowing past and how he just might not be able to shake it… *MOO* Jane quietly turned her keys to her apartment, the door clicking softly open as she stepped inside. She was met with a cold draft and noted that the window was open, a light wind blowing in. She tiptoed across the floor and slid her purse onto the counter, immediately turning her attention to the bedroom. With the little voice nagging at the back of her mind, Jane peeked into their room, seeing the still messy sheets strewn about the bed and floor, and no sign of Eddie or a pilfering woman. Satisfied with the fact that there was no such scene as Liz had effectively carved into her mind, Jane was still disheartened and uncomfortable to find no Eddie hobbling about the apartment. After a quick scan of both bedrooms and the bathroom, her thread of discomfort turned to fear as she slipped back out into the living room, and her fear immediately dissolved into coddling pity. Eddie lay sprawled on the couch, a blanket thrown dismally across him and a light snore emitting from his open mouth. Jane smiled to herself as she came forward, approaching him cautiously before bending down at the side of the couch and looking across at the top of his head, which rested comfortably on the armrest of the sofa. Cordially, she raised her hand and gently stroked his hair, smiling as he looked up at her through a warm, fuzzy haze of sleep deprivation. \"Hey baby,\" Jane cooed, her thumb now trailing the curve of his chin. \"Hey.\" He groaned, his face tightening as he gingerly lifted his still broken body from a horizontal position. \"What time is it?\" He rubbed his eyes. \"Almost twelve,\" She smiled and got up from her squatting pose, walking toward the kitchen refrigerator and returning with two white pills and a glass of water, which she set on the table in front of Eddie. Eddie made a halfhearted, depressed face and leaned his head onto Jane's shoulder as she sat down next to him, and he tried his best to coax her out of the pills. \"Come on,\" She spoke as though to a little, antagonistic child. \"They'll make you feel better.\" She fingered them and probed them into his mouth, cordially following with the glass of water as he choked them down. After recovering from his gagging reflex, Eddie once again curled into Jane's lap and she openly welcomed him into her arms, gently rocking as much of his tall frame as she could with her petite body. \"I love you.\" Jane said, completely consumed in the serenity of their commingling breathing. And suddenly, Eddie's body went rigid. Jane stopped rocking and moved Eddie so that he faced her. His face was screwed tight against his skull, his eyes cinched shut. \"Are you alright?\" Worry crept into Jane's words. \"Yeah, well, no. No, not really.\" Eddie choked out, his lips and tongue having trouble expressing his feelings. \"What is it?\" She asked, deducting pain from her mind because of the fact he was talking normally. \"There's something I've been meaning to tell you…\" His words trailed off as he slid from Jane's lap and hopped on one foot away from Jane, still refusing to look at her, though his eyes were open. \"Eddie,\" A rock formed in her throat and she tried to copy all the movies she had seen as best she could, \"you can tell me anything.\" Her heart skipped a beat. Eddie took a long, slow breath, almost too long and slow before turning shimmering, forlorn, puppy dog brown eyes that pierced Jane's heart. \"The truth is…\" He put a long pause between his sentence sections. \"Yes?\" He slowly blew out his breath before continuing. \"I've been seeing someone.\"[Chapter 8] CHAPTER VIII I Am Only Going To Ask You This Once. Are You A Good Witch Or Are You A Bad Witch? Jane could feel the tears rush to her eyes and her throat and heart burn with rage. \"What?\" She choked out, looking up at Eddie in complete shock, her hands shaking in her lap. Suddenly, he realized what it must have sounded like and his good hand shot out quickly, protecting him. \"Oh, no. No, no, no.\" He tried to take back the idea. \"No, not like that.\" He hobbled over to the couch but as soon as he hit the cushion, Jane was up, her mind and mouth still boiling over his words, completely inattentive to his redemption. \"Why? I mean, how could you?\" She suddenly pointed an accusing finger at him, her eyes growing wide. \"After all this time, and everything I've done for you! How could you?! You son of a bitch!\" \"Woah!\" Eddie was up on his feet faster than he should of and he momentarily faltered. \"Hold on a minute Jane-\" He tried, inching his way toward her as she rambled on and on. \"I loved you! And I thought you loved me too! But now I see that you're just a lying, cheating son of a bitch!\" Tear's fell freely from Jane's face as she stood there shaking in hysterics and sadness. With a quick motion, Eddie launched forward and grabbed onto Jane's shoulders with a firm grip, refusing to let her wriggle away. \"Let go! Let go of me! God dammit!\" Jane tried to beat against his chest in a vain effort to make him release her, and she only found herself collapsing into his arms. \"Now listen to me Jane.\" His voice was somewhat commanding. \"It's not what you're thinking. I'm seeing someone, yes, but I'm seeing a psychiatrist.\" He explained, clamping her to his chest. \"That's why I've been gone on \"walks\" every Tuesday and Friday, I was ashamed. I was ashamed that I had to go to a psychiatrist, that's all…\" His voice slowly faded and the sound of Jane's hitched breathing took it's place. \"I was…scared…\" He looked away from her and began to bounce her up and down in her arms, forcing the words out. \"I didn't want you to think that I was weak.\" After a moment of recollecting herself, Jane sniffed and twisted her head up from his now tear-soaked shirt, looking up at his face with tear filled eyes, \"you promise?\" Eddie smiled meekly and rested the side of his head on top of hers, gently rocking her back and forth as she had done. \"Yeah baby. Yeah. I promise.\" \"Then why?\" Jane fell back into his chest and wrapped her arms around him, slipping her fingers up his shirt and running her fingernails gently up and down his back. \"Why, what?\" Eddie asked, a chill plowing up his spine. \"Why didn't you tell me that you were going to a psychiatrist?\" Jane finally could smell his fading cologne from his tear stained shirt. \"Because,\" He suddenly fell limp over top of her and she readily supported him. \"Because I hate feeling wounded.\" He admitted, enjoying the placid effect her fingernails were bringing to him. \"For weeks after 'becca left me, I just moped around the house trying to think of ways to kill myself and then suddenly, my self-pity turned to aggression and I started taking out the wall. But I had to stop because I had to bring the pieces downstairs at night in garbage bags, it looked like body pieces.\" He suddenly confessed his actions. \"So that's why you went around womanizing and acting like a cold-blooded asshole?\" Jane asked in a serious tone. \"To put it lightly, I suppose so.\" Jane giggled and finally pulled away from Eddie, wiping the streaking tears away from her face with the palm of her hand and looking at her wristwatch through tear-blurred eyes. \"Holy,\" Jane suddenly jumped into action, noticing that she had ten minutes to get back to work. \"I'm sorry baby, I have to go.\" Jane stood up on her tiptoes and pecked him lightly on the tip of the nose, smiling as she hurried to the door and grabbed her coat on the way out. \"Bye!\" She yelled over her shoulder, \"I'll call you before I leave work.\" And with that, she accidentally slammed the door behind her and went shooting to the elevator. Eddie smiled and shook his head, casually making his way to the couch where he slowly, but surely lowered himself until he was comfortably seated on the couch, and silently watched the distinct flags flap wildly outside the apartment windows, a hole in himself suddenly filled.[Chapter 9] Chapter IX It Is Costing Me A Fortune To Keep The Poor Sucker On Life-support System Eddie shifted his weight as casually as he could back into the bed as a tall, thin woman doctor entered with a clipboard clasped against one side and a pearly, white smile slapped across her face. Long, shapely, tanned legs supported a thin torso that curved in all the right places. She reminded Eddie of one of those women you see posing on the trunk of an expensive, slicked up car in magazines. Eddie could feel his temperature rising as he pictured himself sitting solely on the examination table in a paper gown barely sufficient to cover his tall frame, and his jaw cradled in his lap. \"Hello.\" The doctor said as she smiled, her gold, curling, tendrils of hair sifted back and forth on her shoulders as she stuck out her hand, her fingernails painted silver. \"I'm Dr. Youngblood.\" \"Uh…Eddie Alden…\" it took him a minute to find his voice, and even longer to lean forward and shake her hand, cringing slightly. Dr. Youngblood's face suddenly flashed with sorrow and she looked at his hand again, as if confirming her thought. \"Damn.\" She cursed more to herself than to Eddie. \"What?\" \"You're married. Too bad, you know? You're pretty cute.\" She smiled and dismissed her thought with a giggle and a shrug as she set down the clipboard on the counter. Eddie suddenly felt as if he was in the middle of a boiling cauldron and he could feel his face go red with embarrassment. \"So, it says here you have a broken radius, a sprained ankle, and you seem to have lost your appendix.\" She tried to make light of the subject and all Eddie could do was smile in kind. \"Well,\" She came towards him and he unconsciously backed away. \"Let's see if we can find it.\" She paused momentarily at the counter to put on a pair of latex gloves then turned to face him. \"Lie back,\" She said, and he did as he was told, somewhat reluctantly, but did it just the same. She gently folded up the gown, revealing the still healing, four-inch incision that was still rimmed with green and yellow and now purple bruising. He felt his cheeks flush as his blue Superman boxers were exposed. \"Nice.\" Dr. Youngblood remarked, smiling as he rolled his eyes in spite of himself. Her tone suddenly turned professional and she allowed Eddie to become as comfortable as he possibly could, before she dove in. \"I'm just going to check any tissue around the injury for inflammation or tenderness.\" She took her two first fingers on her right hand and gently pushed them down around the colored portion of the incision, moving them around cautiously, millimeter by millimeter. \"Just tell me if it hurts.\" Her fingers attained light, soothing pressure until they finally hit their mark. \"It hurts.\" Eddie pushed out through grit teeth, sucking back the urge to cry out. \"Right here?\" She pushed again, ever so gently and he nodded quickly, his teeth still set in his jaw. \"Alright,\" She seemed to log it in her mind before her fingers continued their journey around the incision, coming up with only one more tender spot before she was done. She turned to her clipboard on the counter and quickly scrawled her findings on the sheet before turning back to him, pulling off her gloves and throwing them into a waist basket near the bed. \"Okay,\" she seemed to sigh as she said it. \"Let's see how your arm's doing.\" She began opening drawers in the counter, until finally pulling out what looked to be a garage saw. It had a short, blunt handle and a shimmering, silver, circular, jagged toothed blade waiting patiently beneath a protective plastic cover. Eddie felt his blood run cold as she plugged the extension cord running out the back of the thing into the wall and came towards him. She was imperceptible to his reaction as she moved a bed tray with a light attached atop it over to Eddie's side and laid down the blade. She grabbed a clean, white towel from one of the drawers in the counter and laid it across the tray, positioning the blade so that it looked like a clean operation. \"Alright,\" she sighed again, leaning forward and gently relieving his shoulder of the sling that supported his cast arm. He cringed slightly as she guided his now free arm to lay dead on the tray. Then Dr. Youngblood caught sight of the fact that Eddie was eyeing the saw suspiciously. \"Don't worry,\" she tried to relieve his worry. \"I've done this a lot of times, and I haven't cut anyone.\" \"At least,\" she added with a grin. \"Not yet…\" \"Yet?\" Eddie's eyes grew wide and he swallowed the boulder in his throat. \"Relax!\" She said enthusiastically, throwing back her head and laughing, her golden hair flowing like a waterfall. \"This will only take a sec.\" \"Or a section.\" He said dishearteningly. And only looked at her when she laughed again. \"Very funny,\" She smirked, then turned professional. She moved herself so that she was between Eddie and the saw, blocking it from his view, while she removed the plastic. As soon as she flipped on the saw and a shrill, whirring noise filled the room, Eddie went as stiff as a board, and he cinched his eyes shut. A shiver rolled up his spine and crawled over his scalp as he felt the spinning blade come in contact with the cast, and the smell of burning plastic filled his nose. Once, he could have sworn that he had felt the blade nick his skin, and he threatened to pull out from her grasp, but then logic - luckily - came into play. After what seemed like an eternity, the saw was turned off and Eddie waited for the bad news, his eyes still closed. \"There,\" Dr. Youngblood turned to Eddie and smiled, waiting until he opened his eyes slightly. \"That wasn't so bad. Was it?\" She asked, moving from her blockade and allowing him to admire her work. The red cast now lay in two pieces, with little bits of plaster crumbling at the edge, and his wet, white, shriveled wrist lying lifeless in the middle. His arm looked like it did when you take a Band-Aid off of your finger after about two days. \"Let's see how your reflexes are doing,\" She lifted his limp hand in hers as she brushed away the remnants of the cast into the waist basket and cleared an area before setting it back down. She then pulled over her wheeled chair and sat down, lowering the tray to adjust to her new height as she began to do push lightly along the far right side of his arm, slowly trailing up. \"Again, tell me if it hurts.\" She mentioned as she continued, again hitting her mark as she hit the fractured part. \"Ow.\" He said calmly, pain momentarily flashing through his face before dissipating. \"Anywhere else?\" Her fingers trailed the rest of his arms and he shook his head. Then, she moved down to his ankle and tried to establish points of pain by moving it in one direction, then another. After a thorough examination of broken, visible things, Dr. Youngblood put away all her things and unfolded a brown, ugly wheelchair from its confinement between the counter and the wall. \"Come on,\" She coaxed with her index finger, pointing him down into the chair and helping him in - despite his objection. \"Now comes x-rays.\" \"Joy.\" He said with as little enthusiasm as possible. \"I'm glad to see you so happy.\" She quipped as they left the room, and he clasped his paper gown defensively around him, his limp hand recumbent in his lap. After the whole lead vest and the lying on the table while a big machine drew a red line over you; Dr. Youngblood wheeled Eddie gallantly back to the room and handed him a small, Pixie cup. \"Have fun.\" She smirked as he grumbled and took it from her, hopping on his good foot into the bathroom around the corner and closing the door behind himself. After reemerging, he found Dr. Youngblood looking curiously at blue x-rays clipped up on the light board, and he set the cup down beside her, quietly taking a seat on the side of the table. She seemed to jump at the crackle of the paper covering the bed and whirled around to smile at him. \"So, what's the deal?\" He said dryly. \"Well,\" She had one of her arms folded beneath her chest and the other clasped onto the bottom of her chin like a professional doctor on television would do. \"You're healing well and all you have to do is keep both your wrist and your ankle wrapped until you come back in two weeks for another checkup.\" She smiled casually as he slid from the bed and hobbled toward his clothes, which were folded neatly on a chair near the bathroom. \"Oh,\" She said in a matter that made him pause and turn back to her in question. \"I'll leave you a lollypop.\" She said with a wink.[Chapter 10] Chapter X The First Glass Was Free, The Second Was Five Dollars, It Contained The Antidote. Eddie awoke slowly and waited a while before finally opening his eyes to the sleep depraved hours of Saturday morning. He groaned as he stretched out his legs, hearing reassuring pops in his spine that he was still alive. He tried to lick the cottony taste from his mouth as he rolled over onto his side, coming face to face with Jane, who was still sleeping. He smiled as he snuggled closer to her, putting his face close enough to hers that he could only see her closed eyelids and nothing else. Delicately, he raised his good hand beneath the covers and stroked her arm, arousing her from sleep. She shuffled a bit before winking her eyes open, flinching back at the light of the room. \"Morning,\" She crooned, stretching her spine as she tipped her head up and kissed his nose. \"Morning,\" He said, still stroking her arm as she scooted closer to him, and he allowed her to spoon into him. She was wearing one of his tee shirts, and the smooth fabric felt good against his warmed skin. Eddie lay there and stared at her as she gently fell back into relaxation, closing her eyes and sinking back into the down pillow, half her face hidden from view. Eddie still stared. \"What?\" She asked groggily, inching her visible eye open and looking at him. \"God you're beautiful.\" He said in awe, as if he had just seen her for the first time. \"Yeah right,\" She laughed, bringing her hands around to wrap around his waist beneath the covers. \"You're such a liar.\" She accused playfully, tucking her head beneath his chin. \"You're right, I'll try to stop.\" He smiled keenly. \"Hey!\" She pointed out and in a swift motion brought her pillow from behind her head and smashed it into his face. With an equally swift motion, he rolled so that he was supported on his good arm above her, the sheets flying wildly. As soon as she could move so that she faced him, he dropped onto her with the stealth of a panther and she couldn't help but scream as he came down. Immediately, he began kissing her neck and up her face, wildly pecking at her playfully. She craned her neck and wrapped her arms around his shoulders, running her fingertips over his smooth skin. Tauntingly, she lifted her head and caught his lips in hers with a vacuuming sound and didn't let go until her lungs burned for air. She sucked the air from him and didn't let him go until he was fatigued with the minimal amount of oxygen and he collapsed onto her, snuggling into her shoulder as he maneuvered his bad hand safely out of the way and tried to catch his gasping breath. \"By the way,\" She said incognito. \"How was the doctor?\" \"She was great. Though you might have a little competition on your hands.\" He said as seriously as he could through a toothy grin. \"You're so disgusting!\" Jane grinned and kicked him in the bad ankle, making him howl in pain. Immediately, she silenced his scream by locking her lips around his and again vacuuming the air from him. \"Oops,\" She said as innocently as she could, seeing the pain flicker from his eyes. \"Next time don't lie, silly boy.\" As he rolled onto his back, she rolled up on top of him, changing positions fluidly. She pointed a finger into his chest accusingly without saying anything, then dropped and snuggled into his chest, her short hair cascading over his face. \"How was it really?\" \"It was fine…\" He finally pushed out, his eyes closed and his face twisted into a grimace. \"What time did you get home?\" She asked. \"Around ten, you were already asleep.\" He said, finally beginning to relax. \"Probably,\" She said, nodding her head. \"Work has been hell lately.\" \"I'm sorry,\" He said quietly. \"You can't do anything about it.\" She took back his blame and shoved it into the air, forgetting it. He tilted his head and kissed the mess of hair across his lips, wrapping his warm arms around her petite body. \"I love you.\" He whispered. Then he added. \"Except when you kick me.\" Jane chuckled and took a moment, \"I'm sorry baby, but you brought it on yourself.\" She snickered as she began to slink back down into the covers, a smile on her face. \"Where are you going?\" He asked, watching as she disappeared beneath the darkness of the covers. \"To see.\" She said slyly, instead ending up at the foot of the bed on her knees. \"Oh no,\" He sighed to himself and draped his good arm over his face, speaking through the darkness. Jane had made it a habit to disappear into the bathroom every morning for the past week to check, but now her hopes were dimming, his were dead. Eddie waited as he heard the rattling of a box and other various noises that he had become accustomed to at her morning ritual. When Jane reemerged, her face was sullen and there was a sad, pathetic look wallowing in her eyes, and Eddie suddenly felt a pain in his gut. \"You know what this does to you.\" He stated forgivingly, making his way from the bed to wrap his body around hers and gently rock her back and forth, trying to ease her pain. She sighed and shuddered beneath his arms, then said something that made him nearly collapse. \"I'm pregnant.\"[Chapter 11] HOLY COW!!! IT IS PART MOO, er, TWO!!!!! I Am So Excited I Am Taking On The Characteristics Of A Bovine!!!!! Udderly Ridiculous Eh? Chapter XI It Aint Over Until The Fat Lady Has Sung Her Last Tune And Keeled Over \"My, aren't you looking marvelous.\" A voice from an imperceptible person issued from one of the people blockading her from freedom. Though this was on office party and most of these people worked with everyday, she couldn't for the life of her figure out their names. \"Thank you,\" Jane managed with a half-hearted, wry smile and nonchalantly tipped her wineglass up to her lips, covering the bottom half of her face as her eyes shot desperately through the party, looking for her husband. \"So how far along are you?\" Another person asked, and she reluctantly lowered her glass. \"About nine months.\" She smiled again into the crowd as they threw more questions at her. \"When are you due?\" \"Next week.\" She sipped on her water from the wineglass. One of her hands was clasped around the glass of water, while her other protectively cradled her swelled belly that bulged out from beneath her new silver gown, still looking like a million dollars. Eddie had put up objections for Jane to come to the party and stay at home in bed, but she just kept contradicting him and putting on her makeup, ignoring his warnings. Finally, in the car, they had struck out an agreement that she was only to stay until ten and then she had to be home, in bed. As soon as they had stepped into the door, they had been separated; a mass of people shoved between them and slowly began moving them away from each other, as if it was a plan. As Jane's eyes skimmed the crowd of decorated people, more questions bombarded her and she began answering them without forced graciousness. \"Have you found out what it is?\" \"It's a girl.\" \"Oh really, what are you going to name her?\" \"Uh, we don't know.\" Suddenly, her eyes caught Eddie's head as he stood talking with some bald guy with patches of thinning gray hair neatly combed over. She stared desperately at him for a moment before he finally caught sight of the fact that she was staring at him. She read his lips as he said, \"excuse me,\" and pushed past the old man, coming towards her. But suddenly, he was intercepted by Ray Brown. Eddie turned to her in his own desperation and shrugged, signaling that he could go nowhere. Jane sighed and nodded dishearteningly, turning back to the voices still colliding with her ears. \"Uh, pardon me?\" She said meekly, trying to step back into the conversation. \"That's quite alright dear,\" A voice said kindly, \"I just said that you should be proud that you have Eddie.\" \"Yes, I am. Thank you.\" She tried politely as she looked into the people to see where the comment had come from, but failed. Jane began to feel exhaustion slide through as she thought desperately for a reason to split. \"Uh, excuse me,\" She thought of a good one, \"I have to go to the restroom.\" To her surprise, the people split like a gate and allowed her through, and she felt silly waddling around with a kicking fetus supported on her screaming hips. She sighed as she saw freedom in sight, but jumped slightly as a hand grabbed her elbow. She spun on her heel, seeing Liz smiling lightly at her as they averted their direction into the closed bedroom across the hall from the bathroom. \"I see you saved yourself,\" Liz whispered into her ear as they closed the door behind them, shutting out the loud music and thunder of conversations. \"Just barely,\" Jane unintentionally moaned as she sat down at the edge of the bed, her legs spread to allow the settling of her monstrous belly. Liz laughed and kneeled on the floor in front of Jane, placing a hand on her knee. They sat there a moment and Jane let her head fall back and her eyes close. \"Sucks, doesn't it?\" Liz asked, and Jane didn't bother to pick her head up to answer. \"What sucks?\" \"Being pregnant.\" Liz said with a smile and rose from the floor, taking a seat next to Jane on the bed, as she laid out. \"Oh I don't know,\" she joked and slid back so that she was laying on her back, her hand placed protectively on the top of her stomach. \"Looking like a cow, eating like a pig, and having your ankles kill you twenty-four, seven. Yeah. It does.\" \"Is there anything good about it?\" Liz asked hopefully. \"Why? Are you planning to be too?\" \"No. Well, I don't know, maybe.\" She couldn't seem to make up her mind. \"Then, I guess, the good thing about being pregnant is that you get pampered more than you usually would.\" Jane smiled. \"And Eddie has been sleeping on the couch for the past three months.\" Jane seemed somewhat depressed as she said it. \"Is that bad?\" \"I miss sleeping with him next to me. I think the poor guy's scared.\" \"Of what?\" \"I think he's scared that he's going to screw something up. This is the first baby that he's actually ever been committed to.\" \"Poor guy,\" Liz breathed out. \"Yeah,\" Jane sighed again and began to push herself up, but stopped. \"You want to feel something?\" Jane asked with a smile. \"What?\" \"Give me your hand,\" Liz allowed Jane to guide her hand across her belly as she tried to find the spot. \"Feel that?\" Liz waited for a second, then shook her head. \"Here,\" Jane moved Liz's hand around again quickly before finally finding it, and Liz smiled enthusiastically. \"Have you figured out a name yet?\" Liz asked. \"Eddie and I haven't decided yet, but we're probably going to go along the lines of M or S.\" \"Just so long as it isn't the name of one of Eddie's girlfriends right?\" Liz joked and Jane nodded her head, laughing with her. \"Yeah-\" She began to say, but suddenly fell short as he face twisted into pain and she let out a horrifying groan. \"Jane? Jane are you alright?\" Liz suddenly turned frantic as she tried desperately to help her friend, who was now writhing on the bed in pain. \"Oh shit, what do you want me to do?\" Jane let out another horrible moan and bunched the bed sheets in her fingers, her face passing from wave of pain to wave of pain. \"…Get…Eddie…now…\" \"…It's…time…\"[Chapter 12] Chapter XII Health Freaks Are Going To Feel Stupid. Lying In Hospitals, Dying Of Nothing \"One more push,\" The doctor urged as Jane let out a scream, her face gleaming with sweat and tears. A blue, paper sheet was laid across her knees so she couldn't see what was going on, but she did know that this hurt like hell. She could see Eddie standing next to her and stroking her hair, but she couldn't feel his hand in her ironclad grip. She felt like there was a building settling down on her stomach and the concrete foundation was slowly shifting and cutting off her legs. With one final push, giving it everything she had left, she collapsed back in the bed, gasping for air and calming her screaming abdominal muscles. She watched as they carried away a small, pink mass. After about five minutes, Jane had regained her breath and the room had turned desperately silent. The machines were off and the doctors had summoned Eddie over to them and were talking quietly amongst themselves. \"What?\" Jane asked hoarsely as Eddie made a sad glance to her. \"What's going on? Why isn't she crying?\" From everything she had learned, a baby was suppose to cry. \"Eddie, tell me what's wrong.\" Jane's voice turned frantic as she tried to push her beaten body from the bed, and Eddie immediately steered back towards her, pushing her carefully back into the bed and catching hold of her hand. \"Eddie, god dammit, tell me what's going on! Please!\" Jane began to cry and trying to pull away from Eddie's hand. \"Jane, calm down.\" Eddie said chillingly. There was a strange stream of sadness playing through his eyes, but he had no emotion on his face. Jane succumbed, trying to catch her sobs again as she quieted herself. \"There's a problem.\" \"Tell me.\" Jane whimpered \"Jane, she's deaf.\" *MOO* \"Bu…Wha…what do you mean, deaf?\" It seemed absurd to her, she had followed every pregnant mother book she could get her hands on, she had eaten right, done no physical exertions, hadn't drunken alcohol, and even got Eddie to stop smoking, it seemed impossible. \"They're saying that the muscles in her ears didn't develop fully.\" Eddie translated for her, mentally cursing himself as he saw tears fill her eyes. \"But, I did everything…\" Jane argued, as if that was going to change anything. \"Everything! It can't be true! She can't be deaf. It's not fair!\" Jane suddenly went into a fit of sobbing and Eddie gently cradled her against his shoulders, his shirt soaking up her tears. She wanted it to be like she had always seen it, the mother waiting patiently while doctors in unusually clean garb brought a tiny, wiggling, pink mass that was quiet with huge, glassy blue eyes and set it gently in the mother's arms, everything perfect. Reality sucked. \"Jane.\" She could here Eddie's unusually calm voice floating into her ear and she slowly calmed her body-racking sobs, but did not lift her head. \"She's alive, and healthy. That's all that matters.\" He took her by the shoulders and made her look into his face, though she tried to twist away, he held her firm. \"Jane, she's beautiful are you're beautiful and that will never change.\" Jane couldn't help but smile through her tears as she once again collapsed against Eddie's chest to cry. After venting her extra tears, she began to calm down again, Eddie gently settled her back in the bed, propping up the pillows so that Jane was somewhat sitting up. She wiped the tears away from her eyes as she saw them bringing the wiggling mass toward her. Without taking her eyes off of her baby, Jane gently reached over and latched onto Eddie's arm and drug him down so he was squatting/sitting at the same height as Jane. She reached out her hands as the doctors gently laid the baby in her arms, the tiny pink head with blue/green eyes peeked up out of a bundle of pink blankets and a couple strands of jet black hair shadowed her round head. Eddie straightened up and leaned over to the side of Jane's head, admiring the tiny creature flexing tiredly in her mother's securing arms. \"What are we going to name her?\" Eddie asked, smiling gently at the blue/green eyed pink thing that seemed to stifle a yawn and giggle silently back. He wagged a finger in front of her, and she latched onto it, his fingertip immediately lost in her mouth. \"I think…\" Jane thought it over for a moment, ever so gently bouncing the new weight in her arms. \"I'll call her China…\" \"China…\" Eddie let it ring through his ears as he brought his forehead against Jane's, looking at her from beneath his eyebrows and back to the baby with an agreeing nod. Then he raised his head and kissed Jane delicately on the lips - the baby still orally latched to his finger - and agreed. \"She's beautiful.\"[Chapter 13] CHAPTER XIII After Observation - Parenting Is Much Like Trying To Staple Jell-O To A Tree \"Oh, come here baby…\" Jane said in a comical, soft tone as she picked up the whaling infant from her crib. \"Shh - shh, shh, shh, shh…\" She tried to calm Mickey by bouncing her on her shoulder, but soon became tired of the ringing in her ear. \"What's the matter?\" She coddled, moving China out in front of her to look at the baby's crumpled, red face - but mostly to get her screams away from her ear. \"Come on now, we don't want to wake daddy, do we?\" Jane resumed bouncing the child in her arms, walking around the room with a hop in her step. \"Too late,\" A groggy voice floated from the doorway and Jane turned to see Eddie standing there. His hair was wild and his boxer shorts were rumpled around his waist, large, sleep-deprived bags shadowing his eyes. \"Aw.\" Jane cooed as she beckoned Eddie over to her as China began to quiet down. She was only a week old, and they were already having trouble. He took the baby from Jane's arms and China immediately increased her scream/crying. \"Are you sure we can't get a refund on this thing?\" Eddie asked, moving her away from his ear. \"Or at least a built-in volume control?\" \"Ha, ha.\" Jane said sarcastically, gently slapping him on the butt as she walked out of the dark bedroom, heading toward the kitchen. Eddie followed her out, his steps slow and dragging as he slid across the cold floor. \"She's just hungry.\" Jane explained as she looked through the fridge for a bottle and milk. She went searching through the cupboard for a pan to heat up the milk in. \"So I've noticed.\" Eddie mentioned. She turned to see him seated at the counter on a barstool, his finger trapped inside China's gummed mouth. Jane smiled and turned back to her task, waiting until the milk was at the right temperature, tested it on her arm, then filled the bottle and brought it to Eddie, who had a bit of trouble freeing his finger, but eventually was successful. As China was quietly feeding, Jane came and sat down next to Eddie, who immediately slumped onto her shoulder, closing his eyes. \"…So…tired…\" He whined, handing the still-feeding China over to Jane before his arms went limp. \"I know baby,\" Jane leaned her head against the top of his, watching China sleepily suckle on the bottle. \"These are just road bumps.\" She tried. \"You mean 'traffic jams'…\" Eddie corrected, the last words slipping from his tongue like the last breath of a dying man, and a rolling snore continued his sentence as Jane smiled to herself. She sat there a moment, noticing that the bottle had meandered from China's mouth and was clasped in her small, pudgy hands as she slept. Jane smiled, both her babies sleeping on her shoulders as she finally felt a roll of fatigue thunder through her. She cringed as she began to move her arm up, gently supporting Eddie's head and easing it onto the counter, cowering as his skull hit the counter with a heavy thump. Now free from her heaviest deadweight, Jane silently and carefully slipped from the barstool. She laid China back into her crib - undisturbed - and walked back out into the kitchen, despite the fact that the bed was calling her name. She stifled a laugh as she saw Eddie try to get comfortable on the hard countertop, folding his arms like a pillow. \"Come on sleepy head, time to go to bed.\" Jane gently shook his arm and roused him from sleep, his voice warm and fuzzy. \"Sleep?\" He asked pitifully, and she couldn't help but giggle lightly as she lifted his arm over her shoulder and tried to help him up. \"Oomph!\" She grunted as she pulled him up from the barstool, his weight overpowering her as they began to tilt. \"Eddie!\" She said loud enough to startle him awake. \"What?\" He asked imperceptibly, noticing his tilted angle and lazily supporting himself. \"We have to go to the bedroom.\" \"…Why?…\" \"Because that's where we sleep.\" \"…O…kay…\" He was so tired he seemed reluctant to move from his spot. \"I'm not dragging your ass all the way to the bedroom, you have to make an effort to walk.\" Jane laughed as he stumbled on the first step. After successfully sliding/lurching into the room, Jane immediately headed for the bed and was suddenly brought down as Eddie collapsed into it, trapping her by his side with his arm, he was fast asleep. Jane smiled and shook her head, craning her neck to kiss him, even though she could only successfully reach his own neck. \"Sweet dreams.\"[Chapter 14] CHAPTER XIV If You See The Light At The End Of The Tunnel - Turn Tail And Run Like Hell \"~Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear China, happy birthday to you!~\" Jane's and Eddie's voices rang out through the house, only to be heard by deaf ears. But Jane was signing as she was singing. As they finished they're song, China clapped wildly, a smile splitting her tiny face. She looked hungrily down at the small, white cake with a giant candle in the shape of a six, stuck squarely in the middle. Blue icing was clumped around the edges and pink flowers cradled in the corner. Taking as big a breath she could fit into her tiny lungs, China puffed out her chest and blew as hard as she could, succeeding in blowing out the candles and a little bit of frosting across the table. Then her parents clapped ecstatically, bringing out a knife to cut the cake with. 'You look silly' China signed, smiling broadly as she watched her dad push his pointed party hat higher onto his head. 'Oh really?' Eddie signed jokingly, deviously setting the knife down in mid slice and attacking China with a tickle torture. China screamed silently and wriggled out from his arms, running to her mother and hiding behind her, sticking out her tongue at him. 'You can't get me!' 'Playing hard to get, huh?' Eddie roared like a lion as he came forward, crashing around the table and sending the two girls into a scurry through the apartment, screaming humorously. Their chase lasted for about ten minutes before Eddie came around the corner of the counter a tad too fast and smacked his ankle onto one of the barstools, ending his chase exhausted and wounded. \"Baby, are you okay?\" Jane asked, noticing the pain on Eddie's face and going to him as he hobbled for the couch. \"Yeah,\" He said between choking breaths, sitting down on the couch and supporting his wounded leg horizontal across his other knee as he examined his ankle, no outside damage to it. \"You sure?\" Jane asked, taking a look at his ankle herself, not looking up when China emerged from her hiding spot from the bathroom with a confused expression on her face. 'Your daddy hurt his foot, but he'll be okay' Jane signed, clearing China's confusion. China nodded understandingly and cautiously approached her father, a grin tugging at the side of her mischievous mouth. Like a hawk swooping in for the kill, China ran forward, placed a kiss on her dad's ankle to make it feel better and scrambled away from him as if he might try to reach out and catch her. Instead, Eddie let his head roll back on the couch and let out a laugh, more trying to get his mind off the pain. \"I'll get you some Advil.\" Jane said, catching Eddie's lips in hers momentarily as she passed to the bathroom. After a moment of shuffling through the medicine cupboard, Jane emerged with a sad look on her face. \"It's gone.\" She showed him, then tossed the empty bottle single-handedly into the garbage can. \"That's alright,\" Eddie said between lifting himself from the couch and a grunt of pain. \"I'll just walk down to the drugstore.\" He began hobbling towards the door. \"Are you sure?\" Jane asked skeptically, watching him lurch to the apartment door, grabbing his coat. \"We could come with you.\" \"No, it'll just take a second.\" Eddie reassured her, throwing his wallet into his coat pocket and opening the door, turning back. \"You two open some presents,\" \"What about you?\" \"I'll look at 'em when I get back, you better not keep China waiting.\" He nodded his head toward what he was speaking about. China was staring intently at the small pyramid of presents stacked in the middle of the living room, licking her lips enticingly. \"Besides,\" Eddie added with a dismissive smile. \"It's not gonna to kill me.\" *MOO* Jane chewed on her bottom lip as she flipped through television stations unconsciously, her other hand stroking China's black hair as she slept against her mother's thigh. Jane glanced at the clock on the wall, noticing that Eddie's \"second\" had become four hours. She sighed somewhat angrily, and looked down at China, momentarily forgetting her troubles. A rainbow teddy bear was wrapped tight in China's arms and brightly colored wrapping paper was scattered about them. They had only opened two presents, vowing to wait until Eddie would return. Flashing blue and red lights caught her attention as she turned back to the television, seeing a quirky reporter standing awkwardly with a series of dark buildings behind him. Iridescent, yellow police tape shifted nervously in the night air as the light man had trouble keeping aim on the reporter who looked too calm to be reporting an accident. \"We're live on the scene of what appears to be-\" Jane was suddenly disturbed from the television when a loud knock at her door disrupted her listening. Sighing loudly, she gently pushed China from her lap, getting another series of impatient knocks at the door. \"Hold on.\" She called, pushing her hair back from her face as she opened the door a little more rudely than what she had intended to. \"Yeah?\" Jane froze as she saw a large, round police officer in uniform standing in her doorway, his eyes sunken into his head and his huge nose nearly consuming his face. \"Are you Mrs. Jane Alden?\" His grave voice sent a chill up Jane's spine and distributed it into a series of tingles along her scalp. \"Yes.\" \"A Mr. Eddie Alden's wife?\" The cop looked at a wallet in his hands, and Jane immediately recognized it as Eddie's. \"Y-es.\" She suddenly felt herself go weak as she leaned against the door, knowing that she was not about to like what he had to say next. \"I'm sorry ma'am, but your husband has been shot.\"[Chapter 15] Chapter XV Never Forget That The Most Powerful Force On Earth Is Love Jane nervously licked her dry lips, her shaking hand reluctant to form around the cool door handle, her fingers shaking uncontrollably. She had done this before, seen the same things, feared the same things, and more or less experienced the same things, but she still was not prepared. She fretted what lay beyond the closed doors, in the room with the pasty walls and the machinery, but she knew she had to go in. She didn't understand quite why everything always had to happen the way they did, but she knew it was too late to help it. Sure, she still felt guilty. A tug at her other hand made her tumble from thought. 'Mommy?' China signed, a sad look of worry floundering in her big, blue eyes. 'Are you okay?' Jane nodded, her voice buried in the dark recesses of her stomach and her hands too shaky to sign. She sniffed back defiantly and signed, 'yeah baby, mommy's okay' China nodded, despite the worry and now reluctance in her eyes and gave Jane's hand a squeeze of reassurance. Suddenly, something boiled up in Jane and she sank to her knees, her tear-filled eyes staring into China's. 'Do you understand what happened to your daddy?' Jane signed, forcing her fingers to work. China nodded, wet, doe eyes shining in the hallway lights. 'A gun hurt him' 'I know' China signed back. Then she paused, 'why?' Jane tried to break it down. 'Remember when daddy went to the store for some medicine for his foot? Well, there was a very angry man there and he…he got scared of your daddy, and he shot him' China furrowed her tiny eyebrows, not liking the story her mother was telling her. Tears began to well in her big eyes and shimmered sadly in the lights. 'But he'll get better, right?' Jane felt her eyes burn with tears as they streamed down her face and she pulled China against her, rocking her back and forth as more of a comfort to herself than to China. \"Yeah baby, he'll be okay.\" Jane said aloud, even though they were not heard. She knew China could understand. China finally pushed her mom away, her eyes still wide with worry and sorrow and anything else she could pack in their that reminded Jane of Eddie, and she had to choke down the urge to cry out. 'Can we go in now?' China signed, peering deep inside her mom's head. 'Sure' Jane rose to her feet, shook off another sob, and took a deep breath, forcing herself to open the incredibly heavy door. It took a minute for Jane's eyes to adjust to the dimness of the room, only an overhead bar light illuminated the space above the bed, as opposed to the blazing lights of the hallway. She wiped away the tears from her eyes with one hand and held tightly onto China's hand. A rock started forming in her throat, as her watery eyes fell upon what she dreaded. She took in the formalities of the recent situation, again beholding her accident-prone husband as he lay recumbence in the hospital bed. Eddie's pallor matched the pale wallpaper again, but unfortunately it was plagued with a deep, black bruise about his left eye, almost swelling it useless. More bruises were set across his cheeks and his jaw seemed to tilt at an odd angle. An air hose was pushed down his throat, and an accordion-like pump hissed and belched air in and out of his renouncing body, forcing him to stay alive. From his eyebrows up, his forehead was wrapped in gauze, a bloom of blood pushing out from above his left eye. He looked inhuman, so many tubes and wires twisting and snaking in and out of his body that Jane's head began to hurt when she tried to follow them back to the machinery piled around him. \"Dammit Eddie.\" Jane hissed at herself, noticing that China was peacefully staring at her father lying in a coma on the bed. China pulled on Jane's hand, China's eyes refusing to tear away from her father. 'Mommy?' China signed, pulling her finger's loose from her mom's grip. 'Can I go see daddy?' 'You have to be careful, you can't touch him' 'Why?' The worry swam back into her eyes. 'Because he has to get better' Jane looked at her compassionately. 'What's all the stuff on him?' 'Do you remember when you hurt your finger?' China nodded. 'And we had to put a band-aid on it to make it better? This stuff is to make daddy better and we can't touch it until he does get better' China nodded in understanding again, her eyes wandering back to her dad. China sighed heavily enough to sink her shoulders and puffed out her cheeks, something she did when making an incredibly huge decision. 'Okay' She signed halfheartedly as she walked carefully towards the bed, turning back to her mother as she was halfway there. Jane put a finger to her lips, telling China to be as quiet as possible and Jane couldn't help but laugh as China nodded her head with big eyes and teeth showing and tiptoed carefully again towards the bed, slower this time. Eventually, China made it over to the bed and was looking around curiously, until she found what she was looking for. With a silent grunt, she drug a large chair over so that it was as close as she could possibly get it to her father's bed and crawled into it, surveying her new territory. From this new height China could take in everything from a new angle, she could see the wounds on her dad, his black and white face, the hoses and wires going into him, and she realized what her mom was talking about. Jane moved closer to the bed, standing next to China's chair and looking worriedly down at Eddie's still face. \"Hi.\" A sudden voice startled her and Jane whirled around on her heel, confronting an oddly beautiful woman standing in the doorway. Her jet-black hair was slicked smooth against her head and a pair of stunning, dark, japanese-shaped eyes were hidden behind a seventy's style pair of glasses. A series of piercings glistened on both eyebrows, perforated her nose, and lined the outside of both her ears. She wore torn and faded jeans that seemed about one step away from falling off of her legs in tatters, and from the holes, Jane could tell she was wearing fishnet stockings beneath. Jane also noticed that when the woman - no, she seemed too young - when the girl spoke, a barbell ring clicked against her teeth from a hole in her tongue. Jane absentmindedly rubbed her tongue against her teeth, wondering what it felt like to have a piece of metal jabbed through her tongue. \"I'm Dr. Zigman, but you can call me Laura.\" The woman - er - girl smiled politely and wasted no time into going over and fiddling with a couple catheters in Eddie. Jane's brain coughed and chugged as it slowly clunked into action, lamely taking in the greeting and coming up with a reply. \"…Hi…I'm Jane Alden.\" She said, forcing a lopsided smile at the doctor. \"Let me guess…spouse?\" Laura looked up and smiled and Jane nodded grimly. Suddenly, Laura's dark eyes turned to China who was sitting patiently and silently next to her father. \"Well hey there cutie.\" Laura smiled brightly, her heavy black shoes clumping across the floor as she floated towards China. \"She can't hear you, she's deaf.\" Jane found herself automatically saying, blowing out air through her nose and wrapping her arms around her as she felt a chill run down her spine. \"That's okay,\" Laura bent to the eye level of China. 'What's your name?' Laura signed as if it was second nature. Surprisingly, China seemed to instantly like Laura and trust her, which was unusual because China barely trusted Liz, probably because Liz couldn't get the hang of sign language. 'China' She signed back, smiling happily. 'That's a very pretty name. How about you and I go get something to eat? Say, some candy?' China looked from Laura, to her dad - who lay unresponsive - and finally to her mother who seemed reluctant but in conclusion nodded her acceptance. 'Yeah! Let's go!' Laura took China by the hand and allowed her to jump from the chair onto the ground. As they were about halfway to the door, China suddenly stopped and turned with a worried look shading her face. Without a sound, China tore loose from Laura's hand and ran back and scrambled back into the chair. She found a proper foundation for her hands on the rail at the side of Eddie's bed and gently leaned over, planting the softest kiss she could on her father's cheek. Then, having finished her deed, jumped down from the chair and trotted back to Laura, allowing her to take her hand again. And as they left the room, to leave Jane to her mind and husband, China turned back and signed. 'I love you'[Chapter 16] Chapter XVI Put A Quarter In And Enjoy A Ride On The Six Second Carousel Jane yawned tiredly as she shuffled back to Eddie's room, a steaming paper cup of coffee sloshing in her hand. Both China and Jane had been awake for more than forty-eight hours and the effect was already taking hold. Eddie's doctor - Laura - had entered and exited randomly throughout the time, always bringing something for China to do, anything to keep her busy. Jane didn't quite no why, but China had taken a real liking to Laura and soon the pair were almost inseparable. China would follow Laura around and ask what she was doing to her father and the machines that were all around him, and Laura would answer every question thrown to her. From what Jane could put together from the interrogation by the police officer in her apartment and from what Laura had been telling her, Eddie had been shot above the left eye. The bullet hadn't been very accurate, because it had hit at a lucky angle, which displaced its embedding into his skull, instead making it bounce off. But the bad part to the story was that the bullet had knocked him off balance and he had fallen backwards and smashed his head on the pavement, which had done the damage to his brain and sent him into the coma. She kept having these horrible depictions of what the police officer had told her about Eddie being fully conscious when they had arrived, and he kept trying to get up, saying that he had to get back home to his daughter's birthday party. Jane wiped the tears away from her eyes with one hand and opened the door with the other, compassion and surprise overtaking her as she saw what lay in the room. China was curled comfortably between her father's chest and arm, her head sideways on her dad's chest and her eyes open, a nest of the blanket covering both her and her father. China smiled meekly at Jane as she noticed her standing there and closed her eyes, trying to hide away from her mother. When she finally summed up the courage to peek out from beneath her eyelids, she was confronted with a half-hearted scolding. 'Remember what I said about not touching daddy? He has to get better' Jane signed, already having set the coffee down on a table next to a big, puffy chair. 'I know' China brought her hands out from beneath the blanket. 'He told me to' 'Honey' Jane sighed again 'Daddy can't tell you to do anything, he's asleep.' 'I know' Her big, blue eyes suddenly filled with tears as she put on her sad face. Jane came forward and China hunkered down into the blanket, signaling that she was not moving from her new spot. 'Do you want to color another picture for daddy?' Jane tried, momentarily averting her journey so that she picked up a large red crayon and a coloring book Laura had brought in for China. China shook her head, hiding her face against her father's side. 'Baby, you have to get out of there, he's not going get better if we -' Jane stopped dead in her tracks as Eddie coughed, a wet, weak noise that sounded little more than a choking wheeze. This was his first sign of movement or life he had expressed since before the second accident. Jane immediately dropped the book and crayon and ran to her husband's side, clasping onto his hand with one shaking hand while she pushed the call button with the other, over and over, so many times that she was still pushing as Laura came back into the room. \"What's up?\" Laura asked coolly, still dressed in the same attire, except now she had a stethoscope slung over her neck like all the doctors on the crappy soaps do. \"He's waking up.\" Jane's words were so quiet that Laura barely heard her, but from the wheezing noise coming from Eddie, she figured it out. \"Well, well, well, rise and shine sunshine patriot.\" Laura smiled, checking the vital statistics on the monitors about him and finally seemed to come to a conclusion. China lay quiet against him, her eyes closed and her ear still against his chest. \"Jane?\" Laura called into Jane's fixed face, her eyes glued to her husband. \"Jane? Hello?\" She gently poked her in the arm to help her from her catatonic state. \"Huh? What?\" Jane mumbled, shaking the absent thoughts from her head and forcing her body to move. \"Could you move China, maybe take her somewhere? I have to get rid of the tube.\" Laura knew that the whole - pulling the tube from her father's throat - would probably not go over well with China or her mother. \"I'll call you when you can come back in.\" Laura smiled as she began to ready Eddie and the equipment around him for his surfacing consciousness. Jane nodded and reluctantly released Eddie's limp hand, pulling China from her father with great problem. China suddenly turned violent as Jane carried her away, savagely beating her mother's back and shoulders as she screamed violently and shed boiling tears. As soon as the door was shut behind them, Laura went on professionally with her work. She gently folded down the covers and gingery checked his swollen eye, startled when Eddie's hand shot up and grabbed onto her. \"Hey Superman, you awake?\" She asked as if she were asking her boyfriend, allowing Eddie to take his time and eventually open his hazy brown eyes to an alien room. He blinked a couple of times and tensed what could in his body. \"Eddie, do you know where you are?\" A weak shake of his head followed. \"You're in the hospital. Do you know how you got here?\" Another shake of his head. \"You were shot, you've been in a coma for three days now.\" Laura said matter-of-factly, noticing that he had a flickering remembrance of it and immediately closed his eyes, turning away. \"Alright Eddie, now I'm going to move your head so that we can get the tube out easier.\" She talked him through it, trying to move his head as little as possible so as not to bruise or damage his brain anymore than what the fall had done. After a meek gasp and positioning his head so that his chin was tilted up in the air like a horizontal sword-swallower, she put on a pair of plastic gloves and moved a bed pan within fluid reach, then gripped the tube in his throat with both hands. \"Okay, Eddie, I want you to put your hand on the right rail. Right, yeah, that's good. Now I want you to take the deepest inhale you can and blow it all out as hard and as fast as you can. Ready?\" Eddie didn't bother nodding, instead, he commanded his aching chest to fill with as much air as possible and as he felt he was about to burst, the doctor wrenched the tube from his throat. The extraction was quickly followed by explosion of bile and empty stomach contents brutally retaliating against the withdrawal of the tube from his esophagus, which sent him into a choking war between gasping, puking, and gagging. After about five minutes, Eddie collapsed back into the pillow, his face ashen and his hair wild and wet and bile dribbling from his chin. \"That wasn't so bad, was it?\" Laura laughed as she quickly threw away the tubing and bagged the gloves, throwing them into a sterilized bag along with everything else they had just used. Then she took a towel and wiped the dribble from his chin without a second look, allowing him to reclaim his breath. Eddie gave her a reckless sideways glare before doubling over into another coughing fit. Laura helped steady him and waited until he was done to begin untying the now-stained paper gown from his back. He sat silently as she pulled it away, crumpled it up, and threw it away in the trash, pausing momentarily to inspect the scar from the removal of his appendix with her fingers. \"What happened here?\" She asked, more to herself then to Eddie. She looked back up to Eddie's face and smiled as he refused to look at her, his eyes trailing elsewhere in the room. \"So,\" She said, pulling him forward so that his head settled against her shoulder so she could tie a new paper gown around him. \"Your wife's pretty.\" Eddie shot a half-hearted, disapproving look in her general direction as she helped settle him back and pull the blankets back up to his shoulders. \"Touchy subject, huh?\" Laura laughed. Eddie closed his eyes and began lifting his head and breathing becoming irregular as he tried to form words. \"…Wh…y…can…t…I…see…?\" He finally choked out, his voice barely an audible, rasping whisper. Laura stitched her eyebrows, taking out her spotlight pen and shining it into Eddie's only good eye, then she moved her finger back and forth in front of his face, but his eye stayed transfixed in one spot. \"I don't know, we'll have to take you down for a CAT scan, hold on.\" She said, turning towards the intercom. As she turned back to ready the bed for mobility, Eddie haphazardly caught her by the arm. She waited as he built up his breath to say what he wanted to say. \"P…lease…get…Jane…\" *MOO* China had her face stuck against the cold glass, her breath spreading a thin sheet of fog across it each time she breathed out. But unlike the glass at the apartment in the winter, there was a strange room beyond, not familiar buildings. The blue line scanned down her dad's body as the bed moved up within the donut shaped machine. She didn't understand why they couldn't be in there with him, and it made her scared and angry at the same time. Jane was standing next to Laura behind a row of computers on the other side of the same room China was in. \"Let me get this straight,\" Jane tried to explain it to herself aloud. \"Eddie can't see because the swelling from his brain is blocking something in his eyes?\" Jane lifted her head from her hand, looking back out to where Eddie lay patient. \"More or less.\" Laura said gravely, the first time Jane had never seen expression on her face besides happiness. \"How long until the swelling starts to go down?\" Jane asked, chewing on her bottom lip as she looked over to China, who's small, round face was now looking in her direction. 'I want daddy' China's big eyes shined in the lights as she puffed out her cheeks in frustration, looking longingly toward her father in the other room. She had not seen him since she was pulled reluctantly from him earlier. 'I know baby' was all Jane could sign back, confusion static in her head as she tried to force down new things that threatened to rise back up. \"I don't know, it could be about a week.\" \"A week?\" Jane thought about it, looking back at her husband as if it would help make a decision for her. \"…Hello?…\" Eddie's voice came weak through the intercom that connected the two rooms. \"Yeah baby?\" Jane pushed the button, her voice collapsing over the small room with a violent thunder and Jane was hushed into a whisper. \"…Jane…\" Eddie's voice was unusually calm. \"…What…s…going….on…?\" \"Dr. Zigman says that your brain is swelling, that's why you can't see.\" Jane bit on her lip, trying desperately not to tumble into tears. \"…Oh…\" He seemed to think about it silently. \"…When…can…we…go…ho…me…?\" He asked. \"Soon baby,\" She said, cutting off the line before he heard her begin to cry. She immediately collected herself and turned to Laura. \"Can we go in there now?\" \"Yeah, sure.\" Laura stood where she was as Jane walked over and took China gently by the hand, leading her towards the door. Jane missed her catch as China clambered up onto the bed and stood over her dad, her mother's hands protectively around her waist. 'Daddy?' China signed, turning to her mother when he didn't answer back. 'He's blind' Jane signed. 'What's blind?' 'It's when you can't see' China nodded understandably and turned back to her father, reaching down carefully and touching him on the arm, drawing back when he moved toward her direction. \"That was China,\" Jane said soothingly, finally releasing China with one hand and taking hold in his. '…Come…here…' Eddie held up his arms, bidding China to come to him. Jane reluctantly released China, who sat down to gently straddle her father's lower ribs, looking into his face. He smiled, raising a finger to tickle her tummy. '…Hey…sunshine…I….missed you…'[Chapter 17] Chapter XVII I Have A Rock Garden. Last Week Three Of Them Died. The Poor Buggers. \"Jane?\" Laura's voice came softly from behind her and she turned from her sleeping husband to face the perforated doctor with a weary smile. Laura smiled in kind then finished what she was going to say. \"I'm ready to discuss the operation if you would like.\" She stood in the doorway, a clipboard clasped in her arm and her piercings glistening in the lights. Jane paused and looked down to China who lay sleeping on her shoulder, her tiny eyelids fluttering unconsciously as she dreamt. Then she looked back to her husband, who lay resting in the bed with his hand loosely clasped around hers, their finger's interlocked. \"Unless of course, you'd like to go into a different room,\" Laura mentioned. \"No,\" Jane said tiredly. \"It would be best for Eddie to hear too.\" \"Well, should I come back later?\" Laura walked into the room slowly; chewing on her thumbnail as her dark eyes switched from China to Eddie to Jane. \"No,\" Jane sighed again, \"we better get this over with.\" Laura nodded and came forward, freeing Jane's left arm of supporting China as she took the sleeping child into her arms. She carefully shifted China up onto her shoulder with little more than a tired moan from China as she settled back into slumber. Then she watched Jane gently stroke Eddie's arm until he awakened. Eddie groaned at the disturbance, shifting carefully up in the bed as he re-realized where he was and what his current situation was. \"It's okay baby, it's me.\" Jane leaned over and kissed him on the cheek, her face weighted with lack of sleep. \"Laura's here to discuss what we're going to do.\" She waited until he nodded his acceptance, then turned back to Laura to get on with things. Laura took a deep breath as she pulled up a chair and sat down, China still sleeping heavily on her shoulder. \"Could you please open the manila envelope on the back of the clipboard, Jane?\" Laura asked, her hands holding up China and useless as far as any sort of operation went. Jane opened the envelope with one hand, refusing to let go of Eddie's with the other. Eventually, Jane pulled out the x-rays from the CAT scan earlier that day. But from Jane's tired eyes, they looked more like a spider had been squished against the plastic sheet and oozed blue blood all over it. \"Okay, the first one on the top of the pile, yeah, that one. That black spot near the back is the hematoma that's causing your sight deprivation.\" Laura looked up from the x-ray to Eddie, who nodded, even though he couldn't see what was going on. \"There are two procedures to get rid of your hematoma, one called SCD and the other is SER, unfortunately there is only a specialist that does SCD here in this hospital, and I figured that you wouldn't want to be flown clear over to Minnesota for the other one.\" She paused in case they wanted to object, but neither did, instead Jane nodded intently, interest pushing through her exhaustion, so Laura continued. \"Wait a minute,\" Eddie said from the side, before Dr. Zigman could get out her next word. \"What's SCD?\" \"SCD stands for stereotactic catheter drainage, which basically means we go in and drain the fluid from the hematoma.\" He only stared in her general direction, kind of looking more over her shoulder than straight at her, but he didn't know and she didn't care. \"Being a doctor, I'm paid to tell you everything.\" She smiled encouragingly. \"So, the good part about SCD is that it's a simple, precise, safe, and brief procedure with very low rebleeding and mortality rates…\" Laura's face was calm in the lights. \"And the bad part?\" Jane asked timidly, looking to Eddie, who only stared in the direction of Laura. She gave his hand a squeeze and he returned the squeeze without turning away from Laura. \"The bad part is that symptoms from the surgery don't show themselves until later on.\" Laura said informatively. Jane sniffed and mulled over it for a bit, before spitting out another question. \"Is there any chance of complications?\" Her eyes shimmered sadly. \"Unfortunately, there are,\" Laura said calmly, \"Side-effects from the medications, the possibility of hemorrhagic stroke, and maybe even problems while the surgery is taking place are all possible complications.\" Jane didn't want to know what kind of problems could occur during the surgery, so she didn't ask. Instead, she just stared at Laura, not knowing what to say. \"But I wouldn't worry,\" Laura noted Jane's staring and tried to ease her discomfort. \"Our surgeon is highly skilled and his patient's often do exceedingly well in recovery.\" \"Speaking of which,\" Laura mentioned as she just thought of it. \"I scheduled a meeting with him for you, if you would like to meet him.\" She looked at Jane, who nodded calmly and then to Eddie, who seemed to think over it before finally nodding his acceptance. \"Alright then,\" Laura smiled and rose from her chair, gently passing back China to her mother and beginning to walk to the door. \"I'll have the receptionist call him down, while you two talk it over.\" She smiled one last time as she closed the door behind her, leaving them to scrutinize and understand all that she had poured into their laps. But instead, Jane and Eddie sat in complete silence, having no clue what to say or do or discuss. Jane sighed shakily and shifted China onto her other shoulder, the girl's elbow digging into her ribs. \"I don't know how I feel about all this,\" Eddie said awkwardly, turning in the general direction of Jane. \"Me neither,\" Jane chewed on her bottom lip, \"but Laura seems to approve of it, and she's our best bet on anything right now.\" \"Yeah,\" Eddie sighed, \"you're right.\" There was a moment of silence before he spoke up again. \"Where's China?\" \"She's here,\" Jane said calmly, looking down at China's sleepy face. \"Killing my arms,\" She added, feeling her muscles begin to shake with tension. \"Here,\" Eddie held out his arms, \"put her up here.\" Cautiously, Jane lifted China up into her father's arms, allowing him to cradle her against his chest as he settled back into the pillows again, closing his eyes. Jane stared at them for a moment, not noticing the small smile that was creeping across her face. They were just so beautiful, her two baby's lying calm in the middle of something so big, it was a shame it couldn't last forever. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door and Laura stuck her head through, smiling wonderingly at Jane. \"You can come in,\" Jane stood, smoothing the creases in her tee shirt as both Dr. Zigman and the surgeon came in. \"Jane, I'd like you to meet Dr. Richard L. King, your neurosurgeon.\" Laura smiled broadly as Jane shook his strong hand. Her eyes playing over the man's crisp, extraordinary features. He had a shock of jet-black hair that was so dark it almost shimmered purple in the lights of the room. He had thick, rich eyebrows and eyes that were an explosion of blue and green, incredibly beautiful. His face was square and angular, coming to well-shaped corners and curves that were tinted with a golden light. And his white and blue garb accented his striking features with such a tone that he seemed to glow. \"Hello Mrs. Alden, it's a pleasure to meet you.\" He smiled broadly, his pearly white teeth shining unnaturally in the lights. And his voice was a force to be reckoned with, it sounded almost as though the words he produced dripped from his tongue like honey, tinted with a slight German accent. \"H-h-hi…\" Jane stuttered, completely in a state of shock. Laura smiled in understanding of the situation and shuffled toward Jane, lying a hand on her shoulder and bringing her back to reality. \"And this is her husband Eddie,\" Laura introduced them, watching Eddie nod in compliment, unable to move both because of China and having no clue where the neurosurgeon was at this moment. \"So this is my patient,\" Dr. King boomed, smiling again, Laura having to help Jane sit back down before she fell down. It was probably a good thing Eddie was blind at the moment; he wouldn't have liked Jane staring the way she did at Dr. King. But he had been surrounded by a whole bunch of women doctors, so why doesn't she get to have some fun? Dr. King took Laura's seat, next to Jane, and closed the little circle they had allianced before. He gently folded his left ankle on top of his right knee and sat with a straight posture. \"I've already told them about your specialty and have roughly explained to them what the procedure is, but you may want to fill them in on the details.\" Laura smiled as she stood behind Jane's chair, her eyes trailing from the surgeon, to Eddie. The neurosurgeon clapped his hands together as though he were hyped up for a big game and leaned forward in the chair, untangling his feet. \"Basically, the steps you'll be experiencing are as follows; first, we'll need to shave your head so that we will be able to see what we're doing. Second, you'll be induced with a heavy anesthesia that will put you into a deep and pain-free sleep.\" He paused, thinking about something. \"Should I sugar-coat it, or get on with it?\" He asked, wanting to know which road to take. \"Just get on with it,\" Eddie said, wanting to know everything that they were going to do to him. \"Alright, third, we'll drill three holes into the back of your skull - called burrholes - localized around the general area of the hematoma. Then, having done that, we'll, or actually, I'll insert ICP monitoring catheter and a pencil-tip sized camera into the holes to help me see what I'm doing and monitor everything.\" \"Most likely we will have to remove a section of the skull about the size of a golf ball in order to puncture the hematoma and drain its contents. Then we'll administer urokinase, which induces the re-growth of tissue and plasma to re-grow the tissue we had to cut away.\" \"And lastly, before you know it, you'll be out on the golf course hitting holes-in-one and drinking beer with your buddies.\" He smiled again, signaling he was done, and all Jane could do was blink in confusion. She slowly turned to Eddie, whose pallor seemed to have drop a shade or two, but otherwise sat stiffly in the bed, China still wrapped in his arms. \"Alright,\" Eddie said coldly, breaking the silence. \"Sounds good.\" He lied. \"Great,\" Dr. King smiled ecstatically, his brain alive with the image of a new BMW sitting nicely in his garage. \"Have Mr. Alden ready at six o'clock sharp.\" And with that, Dr. Richard L. King was out the door. Laura seemed reluctant to move, but eventually did when nothing went on, leaving the two alone. Silently, Eddie turned in the direction of Jane, his face slick of any emotion. \"I don't golf.\"[Chapter 18] Chapter XVIII I Am Presently In A Phone Booth At The Corner Of Walk And Don't Walk Jane sat nervously in the waiting room outside the Operating Room, the same Operating Room she had encountered when Eddie had been hit by the car. So she knew the walls, the tension, the couch, and even the floor very well. China was sitting quietly next to her mother, playing with her fingers and impatiently watching as doctors went in and out of the room her father was \"sleeping\" in. She didn't quite understand what all they were doing to him, but she hadn't liked it when they had cut off all of his hair. \"Jane?\" Her friend's whispering voice calmly brought her out of introspection and she slowly turned to her, wiping the tears away from her face. \"Hey Liz,\" Jane wrapped her arms around her best friend's shoulders, sniffing back more tears as they threatened to press forward. \"How's he doing?\" Liz asked, kneeling down in front of Jane and steadying herself by putting a hand on Jane's knee. \"None of the doctors have come out to vomit their grieving at me,\" She tried to lighten the subject. \"So I suppose everything's going fine.\" Liz smiled at Jane's try and looked over at China, smiling wider. \"Hey there,\" Liz said, completely worthless at using sign language, so she depended on Jane to translate for her. China only smiled dutifully back before looking away, her big eyes busied by staring at the door that doctors kept disappearing and reappearing in and out of. Liz looked away unscathed and looked back to her friend's face. Jane snorted as something incredulous popped into her mind, \"guess what they told us right before Eddie went under?!\" After a moment, Liz only raised her eyebrows and shook her head, not knowing the answer. \"This SDC, or SCD, or whatever the hell it is, it's going to take possibly eight days to drain it all out! Eight consecutive days!\" She seemed appalled as well as amazed by the fact. \"Eight days?\" Liz didn't understand. \"Yes, eight! Well, I mean, he's not going to stay in the operating room throughout it, but he'll have this shunt running out from the back of his head like a…\" She couldn't finish her statement, instead she was overcome with tears and she immediately raised her hands to her face, covering her tears. Liz got teary eyed as well and reached up to wrap her arms around her friend again, freely giving away her comfort. After a moment, Jane recollected herself and pulled herself away, trying to be strong for China. She sighed shakily and sat back, Liz taking a seat next to her, sort of sprawled across the back of the couch with her butt balanced on the arm rest. Liz placed her hand on Jane's shoulder, just out of comfort. Before she knew it, China crawled silently into her mother's lap, standing up on her thighs and looking her straight in the face. Jane held out her hands so that China could hang onto them for balance as she leaned forward and gently kissed her mother on the lips. 'Daddy will be okay.' China signed as she freed her hands from her mother, sitting back down across Jane's thighs. The thought made a tear come loose from Jane's eye and roll down her cheek. 'You shouldn't cry,' China added with an innocent smile. 'Daddy says that you cry too much.' Jane couldn't help the rush of tears as she smiled and pulled China toward her chest, hugging her tightly. After what felt like eternity, she finally let go to see China smiling happily up at her. They sat in silence again, Jane and Liz and China watching the doors intently, Liz stroking Jane's hair, China once again playing with her fingers, and Jane chewing nervously on her bottom lip. Eventually, Laura came back to check up on everything and was kind enough to turn on the television up in the corner of the room, even though a crappy soap opera was on, it still eased spirit's just a little. Despite the fact that they couldn't hear it, Jane could make out that the lead character's husband was in a coma in the hospital, and their sister has just given birth to twins, which really don't belong to her husband, but to the milk man who - Suddenly, Jane got interrupted as a hand was laid on her shoulder, and she turned to see Laura looking down on her. \"What's wrong?\" Jane suddenly didn't like the fact that Laura was standing over her, her hand on her shoulder. \"No, Jane, nothing's wrong, I just wanted to show you something…\" Laura smiled as she held out her hand toward Jane, helping her up from her seat. \"Your friend can come too.\" Laura smiled casually at Liz, who returned with a smile as she rose. 'You want to see a surprise?' Laura signed to Jane, who nodded happily, hoping with all her little heart that it was going to be her daddy. But she was concerned when they didn't go into the room where her daddy was, instead, they made their way to an elevator. As they entered the elevator, Laura turned to everyone with a smile that stretched from ear to ear. \"Alright, now I want you to close your eyes.\" With some confused looks to each other, mostly by Jane and Liz - China whole-heartedly putting her trust into Laura and squeezing her big eyes shut - eventually closed their eyes as well. \"Okay, now Jane, hold onto your friend's hand, and hold onto China's, there, good.\" Laura took China's other hand as the elevator lurched to a stop, a small giggle of embarrassment leaking out of Liz, unable to hold it. Like blind cattle, Laura led the sightless trio out of the elevator and down a hallway that was relatively blank, occasionally looking back to see if anyone was peaking, which no one was. Smiling to herself and waiting until she almost couldn't take it anymore, Laura pushed open the door and pulled the blind people out quickly into an alien world. \"Okay, open your eyes!\" Laura beamed, revealing to the two women that could hear her the fact that they were standing atop the roof of the hospital, the warm night air whispering and flowing around them soothingly. Jane was a little dumbfounded, but shook China's hand gently, finally getting her to peak and return her mommy's confused looks. China, Jane, and Liz turned to Laura as if she was crazy, her face still etched with a smile. \"It's the night sky, so what?\" Liz asked, breaking the awkward silence. Suddenly, they were astonished as Laura's eyeglasses exploded with color and a soft thunder erupted behind them, and they all turned in unison to discover that the sky was alive with explosions of blue, gold, red, green, and white. 'Look at the fireworks mommy!' China signed ecstatically, her eyes wide with excitement, her little face shining. 'They're so pretty!' Immediately, she ran to the edge of the roof, Laura catching her before she was able to touch the railing. Laura laughed at China's humorous scream and lifted her up onto her shoulders, giving her an even more grand view as fireworks exploded in the night sky. Jane sighed shakily as she watched the excitement in China, the way she signed almost too fast for her fingers to catch up to her little mind, and the huge smile splitting her face, reminding Jane of everything. Suddenly, Liz laid her head on Jane's shoulder, her hand snaking loosely around her shoulder as she pulled her toward her, comforting Jane. \"Happy Fourth of July, Jane.\" Liz whispered. Jane smiled and responded beneath her breath. \"Happy Fourth of July…Eddie…\"[Chapter 19] Chapter XIX And Now I Present To You These Two Tragic Miracles - I Shall Call Them Man And Woman \"I'm getting use to it,\" Eddie smiled solidly. \"It's not so bad anymore.\" \"That's good.\" Ray Brown smiled down at him, his arrogant, pathetic eyes that make you just want to kick the crap out of him with a single glance, looking apathetically toward him. It was strange to Eddie, coming back to work where he normally towered above his fellow coworkers, but now he was barely more than half their size. And he felt even more aberrant by the fact that he was wearing a hat, but he didn't really want to show off the wounds on his head. \"That's good.\" Ray repeated, nodding his head as if he needed to reassure himself. \"Well, if you need anything,\" Ray put his hand up to his ear in mimic of a phone. \"Just call me.\" With a slap on the back, Ray went on through the hall, on with his merry, pointless life. \"Bull shit I will,\" Eddie coughed into his hand, covering himself by running his hand over the stubble across his chin. After clearing himself of all bad thoughts about Ray, Eddie pushed his wheelchair through the hallway, stopped by an unexpected voice. \"Hey Eddie,\" The stunning, dark woman that had once so blatantly written ASSHOLE on his ad for an apartment after he was kind enough to give her her earrings back was now smiling happily at him. \"Wh…hey Nina.\" Eddie smiled and nodded in her direction, stopping his advancement down the hall and shifting his bike gloves absently back onto his hands. \"I'm glad to see your doing okay.\" Nina seemed somewhat edgy, as if they were talking about things they shouldn't be talking about. \"Well, thanks.\" Eddie said in an equally embarrassed tone, refusing to connect eyes. \"Uh, it was nice seeing you…again…\" Eddie forced another smile as he quickly went back to pushing himself down the hall. \"You too,\" There was almost a longing in her eyes as he left, he could have sworn it was there. Eddie sighed appreciatively, his office door in sight. As fast as he could, he rolled in and closed the door behind him, relaxing back into his wheelchair as the tensions of the day washed out through his feet. Lazily, he rolled behind his desk and slumped down on top of it, closing his eyes. It was his first day back to work and he was already exhausted from just talking to people and pushing himself down the halls. Suddenly, a pair of hands were at his shoulders and he nearly jumped five feet out of his chair, even though he was forbidden to walk around for at least two more weeks. There was a small laugh as fingers hit specific pressure points in his shoulder blades and immediately sent him into bliss. Only Jane knew those special spots. \"How's work going?\" Jane whispered into his ear, continuing to massage his strained shoulders and back, hitting his favorite spots. \"Terrible,\" He sighed, his eyes rolled up into the back of his head in pure ecstasy. Jane smiled and kissed him on the back of the neck, putting muscle into her massage. Eddie turned to jelly beneath her hands. \"Holy shit that feels good…\" He pushed back his shoulder blades, beckoning more. Jane laughed as she pushed him out from his desk, slipping across his lap as she deeply massaged across his shoulders and down across his chest, knowing all the right places. \"Ah, Jane…\" He whispered warningly as she began kissing him across the neck, her hands edging toward his shirt buttons and fingering them curiously. \"Relax,\" Jane said calmly between kisses, \"I'm just playing.\" She smiled provocatively. \"You've had a hard day at work, you deserve a break.\" \"I agree.\" Eddie finally submitted and allowed her hand to slip beneath the one undone button in his shirt, slowly trailing his chest. Eventually, she gave up kissing him and instead laid her head on his neck, nuzzling it. \"Oh, guess what I bought you?\" Jane asked with a devilish grin, lifting her head and turning behind her for what she had bought him. Eddie raised an eyebrow, then waited to see what she would pull out of the plastic bag he hadn't noticed on top of his desk. How she had carried the bag into his office without him hearing it, he had no idea. Her smile widened as she brought out a pint of Dulce de Leche Caramel Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Eddie threw back his head and laughed, shaking his head in disbelief as she opened it up in front of him, taking her finger and running it through the ice cream, gathering an augment of sticky caramelized dessert. \"Are you trying to tell me something?\" Eddie laughed as she only smiled, bringing it closer to his lips, before allowing his mouth to close over her finger, taking the first bite. Then she dug out another finger-full of golden, gooey ice cream and stuck it into her mouth, leaning over and kissing him deeply. The ice cream from both their mouths mixed openly, becoming a liquid transfusion of love from one enriched adult to another. \"Have you ever thought of why we're together?\" Eddie asked as he broke away from Jane's lips, catching a loose trickle of melted ice cream on his chin with his finger, pushing it back up into his mouth. \"What do you mean?\" Jane asked back, making him take another finger of ice cream just for the hell of it. \"I mean, why - of all the guys in the world - did you choose me?\" Eddie said as she withdrew her finger from his lips, swallowing it down. Jane jutted out her bottom lip in thought, sliding her hand beneath the undone button on his shirt to peruse her husband's chest again. \"I don't know, I suppose…your devilishly handsome looks,\" She smiled, continuing when he laughed lightly and leaned his head back in his chair. \"Your incredible body…but mostly because I wanted to throw you off of that white horse of yours before you got a nosebleed.\" \"Oo.\" Eddie acted as if she'd just hit him. \"Touché.\" \"Naw,\" Jane redeemed herself, \"It's because you showed me the truth about men, even if you did have to step on my feet and prod me in the ass. You showed me that men aren't bulls, or cows, or any other form of quadruped, they're just men.\" Jane smiled and slipped back onto his shoulder, her hand stationary under his shirt, the pint of Haagen-Dazs sitting safely on his desk. Eddie smiled and leaned his head against Jane's, his eyes slowly sliding shut. \"Moo.\"[Chapter 20] Chapter XX Maybe That's Why We Hold On As Hard As We Do. We Can Never Believe That Such A Miracle Could Ever Happen To Us Twice. But It Does. As this, being the last chapter of this particular story, I am very sorry to say that it is coming to close. Your reviews and constant opinions have helped to boost my inditing efforts and excel in something that I normally would not look toward as a part-time activity. Gosh, look at me, I'm getting all mushy…I'm such a sap… But really, you guys have meant so much to me that I wish I could go to all your people's houses and hug each and every one of you…but since I am unable to do that…I would just like to give shout out to those who stuck with my story until the bitter end.

(Can you see it?!?!?!?)) \"Jeez honey, I am soooo sorry,\" Jane objected as she stepped into the apartment, even before Eddie could turn around from the burners on the oven. \"I couldn't get a cab and then the rain slowed me down and…\" She sulked mostly to herself as she hung up her dripping raincoat on the coat rack, removing her shoes and throwing her briefcase on the floor. The weather outside the apartment was absolutely atrocious, the sky was a forbidding dark gray and then rain came down so hard that it seemed as though it could possibly break through the windows. She looked up when no sounds came from Eddie, and had expected that he had fallen out of his chair or something. But he only smiled back at her, one eyebrow raised in incredulity. \"It's okay, China and I have been hanging out making dinner.\" He turned away from Jane, back towards his concealed recipe boiling over the oven. Jane's ambition turned away from apologizing and into coaxing out his forgiveness, not understanding why he was uncommonly mellow about it. She walked silently up behind him in her damp socks, closing her eyes and taking in a delicious scent that was familiar, but unnamed. \"And what is Mr. Connoisseur preparing for this evening's banquet?\" Jane laughed seductively and placed her lips against the smooth skin behind Eddie's jaw, kissing it gently. Eddie laughed and stirred what was on the stove, adding a French accent to his deep voice as though it would make his secret recipe that much more coveted. \"I call it: Macaroni and cheese.\" Jane laughed and patted him lightly on the shoulder, shaking her head at his humor. \"I hear four out of five chefs prefer it…\" Eddie added with a smile, turning to Jane as she walked toward the living room, picking up stray magazines from the countertop as she went. \"Where'd you read that?\" Jane tossed her hair back from her face, smiling up at him. \"Martha Stewart magazine?\" \"No,\" Eddie held in his smile in as he responded. \"The Costco Coupon book.\" Jane threw her head back and laughed, dropping the collected magazines down on the coffee table, only to be found by a tugging hand at her shirt. 'Mommy! Mommy!' China's big eyes met Jane's with a dazzling shine, despite the disgusting weather outside. 'Come see, come see!' China signed ecstatically. China grabbed her by the hand and led her into the back room, the one that had the giant hole in the wall that Eddie had finally gotten around to fixing just before he asked for Jane's hand in marriage, but was now China's personal room. China left Jane at the door as she got down on her belly and stuck her arms under the bed, searching out something. Jane was puzzled, then surprised as there was a meek sound and China pulled out something fuzzy from the bed. 'Look what daddy brought us!' China signed happily, gingerly handing over the fuzzy ball of black and white fur. The little kitten meowed awkwardly and stared up at Jane with huge, green eyes, it's little pink nose shining through her little, round face. It was completely black, except for blotches of white around half of it's face and one of its front paws. 'What are we going to name it?' Jane signed as she handed the kitten back to China, who set it on the floor. They watched it stumble a few times on new legs, before falling over and looking up at them in surprise. 'Daddy says we should name it Sushi…' China seemed puzzled. 'Mommy? What's \"Sushi\"?' 'Well baby, that's the name of our new cat…' Jane smiled as she led China out of the room, the little kitten following haphazardly behind, trying to pounce on China's untied shoelace. \"I see you have added to the family.\" Jane pronounced as she came back out into the living room, watching Eddie as he turned away in almost embarrassment. He had the dishes set out and was just beginning to pour the mac n' cheese into the separate bowls. \"I just thought China needed something to play with…\" Eddie tested, not chancing a look up as he scooped out the gooey orange noodles. \"And you named her Sushi?\" \"You don't like it?\" Eddie seemed crushed. \"No…well…shouldn't cats have names like Mitten or Fluffy?\" She never really had any cats as a child, so she had no clue. \"Come on Jane,\" Eddie snorted with laughter, \"have a little fun!\" He proudly threw the last bit of the mac n' cheese into his dish and threw the serving ladle single-handedly into the sink on the far counter. \"Score!\" He mimicked the screaming of the crowd and put his hands up like field goals, gently bending his head back like a champion. Jane crossed her hands over her chest and tried to look cross, but her placid face kept breaking with a smirk. Eddie turned back to her with an evil smile, \"guess that means you owe me another cheer, Tomcat…\" he popped a loose noodle into his mouth and scrunched up his nose like an angry cat as he chewed. Suddenly, China was jumping up and down in the living room, and when her parents turned their attention towards her, she slapped her hands across her wide, embarrassed smile. 'What's the matter?' Jane signed, taking only one step forward. Her daughter was smiling, so she didn't seem to be in trouble. 'Well…' China was reluctant to explain for fear that they may be mad. 'The kitty was playing with my shoe when she…maid a mess on the carpet…' She smiled broadly and began to laugh hysterically, falling back into the big chair behind her. Eddie sucked in his breath as Jane turned back to him, her hands on her hips and her eyes buried beneath her eyebrows. He smiled and tried to laugh casually, but his smile dropped as she nonchalantly approached him. \"Looks like that cheer's going to have to wait until later, Mojo…\" She placed the tip of her finger against his nose. \"I have to go get some carpet cleaner and a kitty box…\" She smiled and leaned down, kissing his cheek and rising to walk toward the door. \"Which really should be your job…but since you're sick…\" She smiled with new black mail as she walked toward the front door. \"You owe me...big time…\" Just as she pulled on her still-damp coat, China was standing in front of her, her little eyes filled with worry. 'Sushi didn't mean to make a mess.' She tried to cover for the cat. \"She's not in trouble, is she?\" 'Don't worry baby,' Jane stooped and ran her hand over China's hair and looked up to Eddie, smiling once more before getting a goodbye kiss from China on the cheek. As she rose to shift her coat around her shoulders, she signed back without taking her eyes off Eddie's priceless face. 'Daddy's the one that's in trouble…\" And was out the door. *MOO* \"Taxi!\" Jane yelled, waving her arm at the checkered yellow cab driving aimlessly through the water towards her. She stepped back from the curb as it sent up a huge crest of muddy water. The driver was a fat Indian man with a large, bulbous, turban wrap on his head and a gold, ornament, crown sitting on his dashboard. A thick, black beard rested against his chest and his clothes were worn as though they had been thrown on with a pitchfork. \"Hi,\" Jane said automatically, unintentionally stepping back as a waft of putrid stench exited the open door. It was immediately wrestled down by the rain but Jane still shook her head at the intensity. She just wanted to get out of the rain, no matter who with. \"Jane!\" A voice came from behind. She turned from the cab door to see Eddie pushing his wheelchair frantically out of the door to catch her, only his tee shirt and pants keeping him from the pouring rain. \"Eddie! What are you doing?\" She couldn't believe that he was coming out into the weather so ill prepared and vulnerable. \"Lady?\" The taxi driver called out at her from the car with a thick Indian accent, obviously not a man of much patients. \"Just, hold on, please, for one minute.\" Jane pleaded, shaking her hands at him in justification for this awkward moment. The fat cab driver sighed agitatedly and nodded reluctantly, turning back to watch the road dance with raindrops. \"What are you doing out here?\" Jane proclaimed as she began to come toward Eddie, but stopped when Eddie held up his hand. \"Hold on,\" He paused, taking a deep breath and pushed himself up from his wheelchair with extreme agitation, something he was not suppose to do. \"No, Eddie, don't-\" But it was too late, he was already standing awkwardly up from his wheelchair, with the rain pouring off his head and making his shirt and pants stick against him like a second skin. Her eyes couldn't help but trail down the smooth curves of his chest and thighs, sending a slight chill up her spine, but still, she didn't like the look of pain on his face as he stood there. Jane cupped her hands around her mouth and covered her eyes in anxiety, her feet pacing unnervingly on the slick sidewalk as she watched Eddie cringe and sink down onto one knee. \"Jane,\" Eddie blinked the rain away from his eyes, trying to get out what he was about to say, even with the rain pounding against his still-wounded head and causing pain to shoot down through his spine. She didn't understand what was going on, so she just held her breath. There was an awkward moment of silence, and it seemed like the rain has suddenly eased up a bit out of appreciation for the moment. This was a very important time for both of them, and Eddie wanted it to be perfect. \"I want to start our lives over again…the last one didn't do it for me and I want this one to be different. No more bulls, or cows, or quadrupeds with love problems. I just want to be normal.\" He reached back into the pocket on his wheelchair. \"Jane Alden,\" He presented a small, black box from the pocket and opened it up, his fingers shielding its innards from the pouring rain. \"Will you marry me…again?\" Jane couldn't help as a rush of tears burned forward in her eyes and she swallowed the rock in her throat. Watching as Eddie slowly and haphazardly rose to his feet, flinching slightly at the movement. Jane ignored the cab driver's detestable grunts and approached Eddie, looking inside the box to see a two-karat diamond ring sparkly brightly within satin padding. She glanced up to Eddie, who looked down and picked up the ring, slipping it gently onto her finger and pushing it up against the last one that she wore. And all Jane could do was smile through a cascade of tears that rushed warmly down her cheeks and unexpectedly jump into Eddie's arms, through a rush of rich emotions. Eddie stumbled backwards a few steps before catching himself and smiling as she wrapped her legs around his waist for leverage and put her head on his shoulder, whispering her response into his ear. \"Yes…always…\" *MOO* ","Summary":" TITLE : Neophiliactic Bull + Psychotic Cow = True Love AUTHOR : Ananova Crowe ||^_^|| AKA : An Old "}]
