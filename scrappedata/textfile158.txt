And don't tell me that it's nothing, because it's obvious like always. So whatever it is that you did this time, just get over it and apologize already.\" Helena asks a question and gets more than she bargained for. A (long) one-shot. Disclaimer: I do not own Mirrormask, the characters therein, nor Sara Bareilles' music. Cheers! ~/~/~ \" Circus of silence down at our feet Paper cut tigers starting to bleed Hang from your tightrope above the mess Just say you're sorry, no more no less Words you won't use, you don't feel them like I do Show will be over soon It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day I want to walk away too But I want you to say you are sorry I'm not the one who went and made a mistake I want to walk away too But I want you to say you are sorry I used to believe that the storybook's true Now I don't need it, at least not with you So if you see him, the man 'neath the mask Tell him I'm leaving and not looking back Words are no use, you don't need them like I do Show will be over soon...\" \"Say You're Sorry,\" –Sara Bareilles This wouldn't do. It just wouldn't do at all. Surveying the interior of the Big Top, its denizens poised in an array of uncomfortable positions and a wide variety of acts as they rehearsed one last time, Helena couldn't help but frown. Two weren't hard at work. In fact, two weren't doing anything at all, but rather standing as far distant from one another as they could possibly get. There was the first, a lanky juggler, standing pointedly aloof as he ignored the performers surrounding him. The other was a tightrope walker, perched high above on her towered pedestal but making no move to cross the tightly-strung wire. Normally two such entertainers would hardly interact, but inspiration had led her father to the idea of the former tossing objects up to the latter, who would then struggle to cross as she was encumbered with weight, filling her ruffled skirt full to compensate. Helena hadn't really liked the idea at the time, but by now they'd had enough practice for the act to be fluid, the two individuals interacting smoothly. Only now they weren't interacting at all. This was the last day for rehearsals, and the last time before the show was to open. And yet their star act for the newly begun season was suddenly acting standoffish, which made the fiery girl's blood boil. Since her mother had initially fallen ill it had almost been automatic that she take over some of the circus' responsibilities. This included walking the 'team' through its paces, organizing the setup and removal of tents, and making certain that they were always on time and organized, no matter what was going on. Her father still saw to the finances, of course, even as he brainstormed, designed, and directed the show in his endlessly optimistic manner, while managing the prima-donna opinions of the performers with a fatherly hand. But her mother was on permanent light duty, handling the ticket booth and one act only as her contribution to her husband's dream, while Helena took over much of the grunt work. After all, none of them wanted to see a relapse in the future. And if Morris Campbell had to choose between the love of his life and his life-long dream, there really was no doubt which one he would pick. Which was why the two performers' blatant disregard for standard procedure was so infuriating to her: Helena was essentially responsible for them! Especially if something went wrong. And what was worse was in knowing that they knew that the cast were strapped for time, and that this would be their last chance to practice before the audience would roll in and fill the seats. The success of this season rested largely on them , as this first performance would set the stage for local popularity and word-of-mouth publicity. Why couldn't she make them see that? Knocking her wings back irritably (an attachment her father had thrown on to her costume once she'd turned eighteen and had developed too much to use the guise of \"Bambino,\" any longer), Helena marched straight up to the man that had been her friend for almost longer than she could remember. At least four years, although it felt like she'd always known him; no, that they had always known each other. She hadn't been sure at first, but several years worth of confessed dreams coming from him made her wonder, particularly regarding the source of her illustration inspiration. But connection or no, it seemed that only friendship and not memories had traveled with them back into the real world, and then She had come anyway, changing everything anyway. Her arrival had stemmed first with Helena's mother. Right after her surgery, and even later, the doctor had been adamant about Joanne no longer doing acrobatics, particularly as her brain attempted to heal itself of the previous pressure and scar tissue. Nothing involving turning upside was allowed, nor anything that could put her in a situation where she exerted herself and could possibly collapse from the effort. Helena's father's answer was to hire a new act; a female tightrope walker with experience in ballet and mime. She quickly became a fan favorite, boosting circus morale and drawing flocks of audience members to their performances. He'd been a fan of her too. First it had started with the desire to teach the 'new girl' juggling, by way of , \"oh, Helena, is it alright with ye if I help Torre practice? Ye can practice with yer father just this once, right?\" And then it had led to, \"Helena, should I change my outfit? Torre's is such a lovely color, I thought I'd give mine a switch.\" Suddenly, however, it had ended up at, \"Helena, what should I get Torre for her birthday?\" and, \"Helena, which flowers should I pick?\" The two, both older and more street-smart than she, had begun dating, and she couldn't tell when it had begun, and overall, the whole thing was actually quite tiresome. But it had become a constant within their circus \"family,\" the romance of the jack-in-the-box and his porcelain ballerina. Some of the other artists had even begun whispering about an upcoming proposal, gossip Helena tended to hush upon hearing, but her father's reaction lied only in the realization that the two of them performed better when together. Except for today, apparently. And Helena wanted to know why. After all, the show must go on, regardless of their feelings (or even hers) and no truly professional entertainer was ever foolish enough to let their emotions get in the way of their act. Unceremoniously the owner's daughter marched across the sandy oval, snatched at her friend's sleeve and pulled him away, into the shadows of the tent. He struggled and squawked impressively in his usual fashion before eventually settling down enough to glare at her through the eyes of his mask. And then she tore into him. \"Valentine, what is wrong with you two today? And don't tell me that it's nothing, because it's obvious like always. So whatever it is that you did this time, just get over it and apologize already. We only have an hour before curtain—,\" she paused for a moment as Pingo/Bing, their resident mime, and his new tutu-ed partner passed by, nodding cheerfully to her in greeting and carrying on a silent conversation all to themselves. Helena's voice started out lower when she began again, but with no less frustration evident, \"…so whatever is going on between you two has got to stop. Please. \" Ending on a plaintive note, she searched what she could see of his face—a flash of mouth, a glimpse of eye—then waited. Connor \"Valentine\" Haderlie, a nickname that she'd automatically given him and which had stuck before he'd even got the job, sighed heavily and finally lifted the squarish, be-spiked and goateed mask from his face. \"We split, thanks for askin'. And here I was trying to pretend that all was well and to keep my 'cool' in the face of pressure.\" \"'Cool'? You're practically frigid right now, Val,\" she retorted as two emotions warred inside of her: frustration at his blasted timing—by all that was ink-drawn, what horrible timing! —and an odd sort of relief…that she would have to examine later in depth. And then realization hit home and her voice became softer, \"and what do you mean 'split'? You and Torre were getting along fine as of yesterday. What…what happened?\" she swallowed on a dry chunk of concern. \"Nothin'. Nothin' happened, just as it never has,\" he muttered, scrubbing a hand down his face and then itching at the mask band held tightly around his ash blonde hair, \"look, ye know now. May I go, yer Majesty?\" The words were abrupt; a half-hearted attempt at an emotional defense. But they were closer to home than he could have known as another face just like hers came to mind, \"No!\" the single word cameo out harsher than she intended, as the much shorter girl prodded his chest once, then twice, ire bringing her closer to him, \"not until you undo whatever you did, Valentine! I won't have the two of you messing up my— our show just because of your squabbling!\" \" 'My show'? Oh, I see how it is then. Yer more worried about ye and yer Da's silly circus than the wellbeing of yer best frie-!\" \"OUR silly circus! Own up to some responsibility for once!\" \"—and here I am, with my 'eart almost torn out. But no, no, 'Valentine' is always in the wrong, isn't he? Why is that, I wonder?\" he asked the empty air, exasperated, \"'Valentine, don't do this.' 'Valentine, stop messing with that.' 'Connor, maybe it's time ye moved out and got a real job, don't you think?' Crush it all, ye sound like my mother, Helena!\" Furious, she spoke thoughtlessly, angrily, \"well, someone has to be! I mean, you don't take care of yourself-!\" \"I take well enough care of meself!\" \"—and every time you've done something wrong, I'm always the one who nudges you into making things right.\" \"I don't know what yer talking about.\" \"Well, there was that time with those twin acrobats, for one—.\" \"—not my fault.\" \"And then the time you accidentally called my mother an old mango!\" \"—there's a perfectly valid explanation fer that! Which I'm about to get to…\" \"Not to mention just how stubborn you were with apologizing to your tower,\" she finished rashly, then not thinking about what she had said, pointed to the performer that was still standing atop her pole, \"this is just like then! Some stupid argument that has no purpose or explanation. So why don't you just go to her and say you're sorry!\" \"Why?\" he began as a shout, drawing some attention from their \"family\" before dropping his words several octaves until they were nothing more than a gritty growl, his eyebrows dark and furrowed over flashing light eyes. Connor then threw his hands out in desperation, \"why should I apologize when she's the one who broke with me? She said-! …Wait, what was that you said about my tower?\" They both stopped moving like stills in a moving picture reel, realization making their eyes meet. Helena blanked for a second, then, \"…it's nothing. I just-.\" But she never discovered what she 'just' did as Valentine, not her Valentine but the Valentine that she'd come to know, blocked her escaping path, long fingers gripping her upper arm, \"No. No.\" The touch burned on contact, and Helena drew in a sharp breath. Then his face took on an expression and, oh how she wished it hadn't. That she wasn't look at the raw oyster of emotions within his hardened shell. She wished for a moment that all she could see was his mask, which told her how he was 'feeling' or what his opinions were. Not this raw swirl of anger, offense and something…speculative. Curious with epiphany. It spelled out trouble for her in the form of change. Because well, she wasn't sure what she would do if that result did occur… His grip became more certain and less desperate, making her look up into Connor's face, his brows crunched thoughtfully, eyes somewhere off in the middle distance. He swallowed hard and licked dry lips, one arm lifting up to finger the tent's draped fabric, before finally tearing himself away from his vacant view. And back to her. \"What…what was that about my tower?\" \"Nothing.\" Her deadened response only livened him as he turned to more fully grip both of her arms now, pulling Helena into the privacy of the tent's thick folds, a hazy red glow lighting them just enough for her expression to be clearly visible. A half an hour. They only had a half an hour left now , was all the thought that she would allow herself to think through the numb haze that had overtaken her. It was either that or face Valen— Connor . And she didn't know if she could handle the truth—whatever it may be—right now. Abruptly he was crouching low to look her in the eye. Stubbornly, resolutely. As though waiting for something. And in his eyes she had a clear vision of a friend that she had never thought she'd never see again. Connor and Valentine, in one. \"I have told ye many of my dreams over the years, Helena, but never that one. And don' say that I did, because I know I haven't. It's too…personal. So now, I'm going to ask again. Helena…what do ye know about my tower?\" his expression had an almost haunted earnestness that made her fear to lie—he would see it, she knew, and be infinitely disappointed with her. Maybe forever. So there was no other path to choose… \"Only…that you must have been a very important man to have a friend like that.\" The words slipped free in a whisper, dark eyebrows clenched on her own face in…what? Fear? Rejection? She was as afraid of their friendship changing as she was of people intruding on it. But what was it that she was really afraid of? What harm was there in maybe, perhaps revealing to him that they had, quite literally, known each other in another life and another place? Connor had never rejected her, nor ever would—he'd proved that over and over in the past. So what was she afraid of? And why did it clench at her heart and send adrenaline rushing through her? Still, Helena held herself breathless and emotionless as he processed what had been said, face paused in a worried composition. It was like watching the sun rise on a spring morning, hidden from the world's view and clear and unhindered. His face changed in phases, his eyebrows first becoming undone, wrinkles gone as they raised in joy. And across his angled face, a slow-growing smile ached from cheekbone to cheekbone, eyes as small as the dots that she had so loved, and buried in happy creases. Wait. Loved? The question was tossed aside as he whooped gleefully and snatched her up for a whirling, twirling hug, nearly crushing her attached wings in his exuberance. Then, when Valentine had finally stopped, letting her go, he pressed the palms of his hands to her face, cupping her cheeks with hands long and broad. Lengthy enough to dive the tips into her short hair even as he held her there, immobile. \"Ye know. Ye KNOW! Ye were there , weren't ye? Right from the very start, knowing ye. And I am not crazy , by all that's green and gold. Mum was wrong , and I knew that someday I would meet the girl in my dreams and then I did, but ye didn't remember! So I kept telling ye my dreams, hopin' and hopin' that you'd wake up one day and know . Oh, Helena this is wonderful! But how do you…but…?\" \"How…?\" the question remained unarticulated as several thoughts fought to find a place at her mouth and thus none succeeded. Instead she just searched his features, seeking…something. But if he'd been dreaming about her, and she had been dreaming about him…and then there were her drawings? His tower she'd found illustrated on her mother's get-well card. And his 'character,' was one of her many sock puppets. But how much was her creation and how much was a reflection of what already existed? He was older than her—had he created the world, and she just brought it to life? She had so many questions, but the answers were so far away… \"Val- Connor . What I mean to say is…\" \"She broke up with me on account of ye.\" \"What?\" what was he talking about. Then the reason for their initial conversation hit home like a lightning bolt and, dumbfounded, Helena stared. But all Connor did—dressed in wonderful browns and creams and just a hint of Valentine burgundy—was straighten himself in order to more fully look at her, half in wonder as his hands traced the half-moon circles beneath her eyes. He was somber, serious, and utterly focused on every detail of her face now…and was standing by far the closest that he ever had in their years of knowing one another. And in that moment of tension Valentine explained slowly, calmly, and like stairs falling from the sky, suddenly everything made sense, \"Torre broke up with me on account of ye. She pulled me up into her auto and told me outright that I should stop wasting her time and go after what I really wanted. And that ye were eighteen now and it was 'bout time that I stopped using our—yers and my—age difference as an excuse,\" he watched for a response, and when one didn't come, continued, \"she told me to stop talking about my dreams and instead to go after them, Helena. Now, I have to ask again, how do ye know about my tower?\" Helena swallowed quietly and searched for some response—any response. Her mind was in overdrive, her being about to crash. How much could she say before incriminating herself? And what's more…what he was saying…did that he mean that she was the girl of his dreams or the girl just in his dreams? And maybe…what was he trying to say? Valentine was her best friend; her closest ally. She couldn't just… they couldn't just… Suddenly an image came to mind of their \"family\" members whispering. But they always had fallen silent whenever she came around. Helena had always assumed that this had been because she had tried to stifle them in the past; to end the cycle of speculation and whispers. But what if those tall tales—those ideas of engagement and marriage—hadn't been about Connor and Torre, but maybe about something else… someone else…? \"My…my sketches. One day they didn't exist, and the next they did. I started with blank spaces and filled them up, and when I ran out of room I turned them over and began again. You…the real Valentine …he's nothing but a sock puppet. Just a sock puppet. But then there was a princess and she switched places with me, and Mum got sick and the Queen was sick, too, and then there were sphinxes and giants…the really useful book…and the Bobs and Malcolm…\" \"Then ye met me. For years ago ye actually met me ,\" he murmured. The hands holding her face stretched so that his pinkies ran along her jaw, and she so wished that he would let her go. Let her go so that she could look at anything but his direct gaze. Because a mask doesn't burn you when you look at it… \"Now I suppose it's my turn to tell ye a story,\" Valentine finally intoned, a half-smile ever present upon his face. But it was melancholy as the twenty-two year old's gaze turned inward, and almost automatically he brushed a kiss across her hairline in absentminded devotion. In that moment Helena had to remind herself how to breathe, \" A long time ago a boy discovered a world he'd never seen before. It was strange and didn't listen to gravity. And everyone wore masks, and the boy found that he had to wear one as well, to be one of them.\" His expression altered somehow as he continued. Helena couldn't exactly pinpoint how, though, \"Then a man came and took him away from it, and gave the boy to a woman who said that everythin' he remembered wasn't real. So the boy tried to believe what she said, but in the meanwhile he dreamed of where he had been. A world of flying books and bathtubs of fish. Never seeing another being like hisself beyond the masked folk. Until one day, years later, a girl appeared. She made rules of the place and created it so that everythin' had order. And instead of just livin' in the place, she influenced it. For years of 'is life. And they never interacted, the boy and girl. Until one day she, the creator they called her. The maskless one. She talked to 'im and saw 'im. And the next day the boy woke up and wanted to join the circus.\" His eyes bored deep into her soul, \"So tell me this answer, maskless girl, which came first? Yer dreams or mine?\" \"Maybe,\" and the words came out as breaths of stuttering speech, hardly discernable except that they were so close, \"maybe they already existed. And we just…stumbled on them?\" \"It's possible,\" the shadow of a beard on his chin scratched against her forehead as dark strands of her hair caught in his stubble. Then Connor…Valentine breathed her in, just once, before continuing, \"could it explain why I was attracted to such a wee thing like ye upon our first meeting? Because I've never wanted to kiss an underage girl more than I did four years ago, my first time at the circus.\" Her thoughts stuttered to a complete and total halt. He wanted to kiss her. Connor…who was actually Valentine …had wanted to kiss her for four years. \"Hello. Did I dream you a boyfriend?\" \"No! You did not! He's not…He's just a…He's…Oh, he's…\" \"I'm sorry I brought it up.\" And how did she feel about this? Confusion was natural, of course, and shock. But…what about her negative feelings regarding Torre? Could that be construed as…jealousy? At her taking up all of Helena's friend's time , or just at her taking Valentine, period? And then there was the feeling of comfort around him, despite his 'not remembering.' Connor and Valentine had come into her life almost as though they'd always been there…would always be there. And now there they were, his face so close that she could see every nuance. But hope warred to the very top of all the things that he was feeling. Which led to the question, could she give change a chance? Could she set aside her fear that their friendship might becoming…something different? Or maybe different was really more, in this situation? Well, there was only one way to find out. Taking in one deep, brave breath, Helena allowed herself a cheerful, confident smile. A trademark Helena smile. And finally, taking a leap, asked, \"well what about now?\" \"Now,\" he chuckled, dipping his eyes again down to her level so that they were literally eye to eye, \"I do have Torre's instructions to consider, am I correct in saying so? And to just, 'say sorry,' as ye've so eloquently put it, I should make some restitution in order to make things right. Which leads to the question…what exactly does a gentleman do after telling a girl that he's been dreaming about her since she was fourteen?\" \"He gets back into that tent before she murders him for ruining her show.\" An ironic eyebrow met her droll expression, almost as though he was tutting her for her shameful response to his romantic overtures, \"does he now?\" \"And maybe then they can talk afterward…\" \"I think that's a lovely start,\" and then both Connor and Valentine dove in for a short, energetic kiss. His mask knocked against her forehead, and the fragile tulle of her wings were creased beyond repair at her back. They were lost in the surprise of finding each other for a slim moment, until he tore himself away and dragged his 'superior' inside with only ten minutes to spare. And then, and only then, did the woman standing upon her towered tightrope smile. That was more than enough of an apology for her. Let the show begin. ~/~/~ AN: \"Torre\" translates into \"Tower\", according to my Spanish dictionary. But If I've got it wrong, don't blame me—blame Langenscheidt's Universal Dictionary. XD Also, this is a drabble that kind of ran away with me. ^_^; It started out simple—the idea of Valentine's decided lack of apology-related-abilities crossing over to the other side. But it turned sappy somewhere two thirds of the way in. Oh, well. XD In any case, this was inspired by the song, \"Say You're Sorry,\" by Sara Bareilles( http : / www . youtube . com / watch ?v=2T b7x Qluc mU ), particularly as the lyrics includes mention circus details. And the other half of the inspiration came from a drawing I did that matches the beginning of the one-shot.

I own nothing but my own imagination and all that jazz. ~TheAwesomeGeek Stars fall down When you want to go back to the world you have left, but don't know how to get there, what do you do? Helena had the circus, she had her mother, her father, and well… she had 'Valentine'. But it didn't feel right. The circus was her parents dream, not hers. Of course, she loved them and everything, and it was fun, but it wasn't what she wanted to do with her life. And 'Valentine', well, he just wasn't a Valentine. He was sweet, kind, and rather fun at times, but Valentine was so much more. Valentine was sassy, and stubborn, and full of crazy ideas. Helena missed him. Helena didn't want to live a normal life anymore. She had always wanted something else, and she assumed that something was the normal life she had never had. Now she found out it wasn't. After the whole thing with her mother and the dream, she had found somewhere she really felt at home. The Mirrorworld. It was her world, and she wanted to go back. Sadly, she couldn't. It was her parents. She couldn't just leave them without a warning. That, and she didn't know how to get back. So, every day she would go to the circus, perform and smile, talk to 'Valentine' and the others. And at the end of the night she would go back to the trailer, lie in her bed as she made something new for Mirrorworld. That was the thing, there was a lot of rebuilding to do, since most of her drawings had mysteriously burned up that night while she was sleeping on the balcony. Probably just a light bulb that had exploded or something… The same routine, over and over again, day after day, until one day it all happened again. It had been a spectacular show, they drew in more audience every time, and exhausted and happy Helena was walking towards the trailers while telling her father a riddle. They didn't even notice before they heard the shouts, which only made things worse for both of them afterwards. She was lying there in the dressing room, pale and barely breathing. \"Mom!\" \"They said they had gotten all of it!\" Morris, Helena's father, was sitting in the sofa, with his head in his hands like he could make the whole world disappear by keeping it there, while his daughter stood on the other side of the table, shouting and with tears streaming down her face. It just wasn't fair! Not again. \"They thought they did.\" His voice sounded hollow. He sighed and got up, embraced his daughter as she shook, a silent tear running down his cheek. \"But… They removed it! They said they removed it!\" Helena was in shock. She wasn't sure if she wanted to cry, or be mad, or just be empty. \"I know, Bambino, I know.\" \"This… This is all my fault!\" she managed to get out between the sobs. \"I wanted to leave, and now she is sick again. If she dies it's all my fault!\" Her father took her by the shoulders and pushed her away so he could look at her. He looked so serious and so sad, Helena stopped crying for a moment. \"Don't you dare say that. These things happen, and nothing I, you or anyone else has said, could have done anything about it. So there's no point in you blaming yourself.\" Helena could see the tears in his eyes, even though he tried to hold them back. \"Will there be a surgery?\" \"They think it might damage her brain if they took it out.\" Helena just nodded, got up and started to walk towards her room. \"I think I'll go to bed now. Good night dad,\" she said, her voice hollow from exhaustion. It took a while still before she could sleep, and from somewhere seemingly far away in the state between dreams and reality, she heard sobbing. That night was the first night she had dreamt in a long time. ","Summary":" This is a remake of an old fanfiction I had posted on here but never finished.

He only catches himself when the ball comes tumbling down into his hand. \"You know, I was just talking to the woman in the window.\" \"My mother.\" \"The lovely lady in the window.\" He gives her his most charming grin, \"You know, I've always wanted to join a circus.\" \"Great. You'd have made a lousy waiter.\" She jokes, and the two laugh for a while until he finally stops laughing to think for a second. \"What?\" She's quick about a comeback. \"Well, if you can't even walk down a line without crashing.\" He can't resist a small chuckle, thinking back to his first real job. And how he managed to drop a tray just from opening the kitchen door. Real life didn't suit him. Yes, he would like very much to be in a circus. He is juggling. His therapy, he claims, ever since he was a kid. Through juggling, throwing everything in the air, keeping it afloat, he is weightless. He flies. She grabs his attention by including herself, effortlessly, and they spend a few moments grinning at each other, juggling together, before she decides to speak. He catches his flying therapy and gives her his full attention. \"Valentine-\" \"Still calling me that?\" \"Let's go on an adventure!\" \"An adventure? We're going on tonight. Isn't that supposed to be an adventure?\" \"Performance an adventure? That's all an act. It's when you don't have anything planned out that you really have fun.\" \"So what's your big adventure, eh? Magical flying creatures whisking us off up in the sky? Is it involving a journey? Love those, I do.\" \"Pingo has been in this town before. Found this wonderful place with the best meat sandwich he's ever had. And his taste is impeccable.\" \"Meat sandwich. Yes. Adventure time.\" \"But he cannot remember where on Earth it could be.\" \"Right, right. Of course. The usual.\" \"What, you're not excited?\" \"Well that seems a bit vague. Are we just going to try every single sandwich place in the whole bloody town until we fill up to our limit and keel over?\" \"No, no, he knows the name. Or atleast he thinks he does.\" \"And so we adventure.\" \"And so we shall, Mr. Valentine.\" \"You know, giving me that name. Valentine. You're not hinting at anything, are you?\" He smirks, his flirtatious levels at an all time high, and she just smiles back at him. \"Well your given name is a bit drab, isn't it? You need one with a bit of dignity and style , mixed with a bit of romance.\" She's smirking to herself, quoting from some unknown source, and he's a bit bewildered but amused all the same. Circus folk. He loved them. He's laying down on a stack of hay. A stack of hay . This hasn't happened since he was a child. Laying on a haystack, staring at the sky. He feels like he should be in a petting zoo right now rather than a traveling, with some goat nibbling at his hand. He has gotten into routine, for the most part. His new occupation is now his new family, finding empty clearings like the one he is in now, filling it up effortlessly so that even though they were in a different place, it still felt like the same home. Just with hay stacks. Then Helena comes and sits right next to him on his stack of hay. \"Was it like the movies, Valentine?\" \"Was what?\" He supposes now, especially in this mask, he is Valentine, the very important man, not regular whoever from that one town that no one really remembered. Not even him, really. \"Real life.\" She clarifies, and he turns his head to look at her, eyes lit up and with a toothy grin that has him taking off the mask to properly look at her. His grin grows to match hers, \"Do you hear yourself? Real life in a movie . How absolutely ludicrous.\" \"No need to be cruel about it.\" A bitter tone attempts to hide the smile on her face. But he's really looking at her now, so it's a poor disguise. \"its a bit like grass growing.\" He rambles, waving a mask in an attempt to look more intelligible than he was, \"You can't watch it grow. Youll bore yourself to death from the monotony of it all.\" \"That was incredibly unfulfilling.\" \"Such is life.\" \"Just your life probably. I bet I would have been great at it.\" \"Yes. Everyone's lifelong dream. Being great... at growing grass.\" Helena is in her trailer, drawing, when Valentine decides to pop in, unannounced. He figures he might as well go all out, and jumps on the bed, sending a few pens flying. \"Valentine!\" Helena exclaims, but he ignores her annoyance. \"Do you know what day it is?\" \"Who keeps track of that?\" \"The fourteenth of February.\" Valentine continues, grinning at her, \"The day of St. Valentine himself. My birthday.\" \"Really?\" \"Might as well be now.\" \"And so what's the big plan?\" \"You know, the usual. Cake in my honor, gifts in my honor, party in my honor...\" \"Well,\" She hops off of her bed and rummages around her things, \"Here's a cake.\" She hands him a muffin. \"And a gift.\" She writes, 'To Valentine' on the latest sketch she grew and hands it to him. \"And my party?\" \"Well, Valentine, a whole entire show is being put together in your honor. In only a few hours, actually.\" \"Oh really?\" \"Yes. Dozens of performers-brilliant, all of them.\" \"Will it have the amazing Fortuna? I've always liked seeing her perform.\" \"Of course. After all, you are a very important man.\" \"And will I have the lovely Helena accompany me this evening to the show?\" \"Well, that might be asking a bit too much.\" He grins and gets back on his feet, towering over her like the large towering thing he was. \"Even if I put a cherry on top of it?\" \"When you put it like that ...\" She trails off when he kisses her on the cheek. He is smiling now, not grinning, but the smile fades a little when all she does is stare blankly at him. \"Helena?\" He asks, genuinely worried now with how she's frozen emotionally and physically. Then she bursts into laughter. \"Come on,\" She chuckles, nudging him in the chest with her shoulder, \"Go and get ready for your party. I need to get dressed myself.\" \"Right, right. Valentines mustn't be late for their own events.\" \"Yes, yes. You mustn't keep lady Fortuna waiting.\" ","Summary":" They spin, her unintentionally, him to stop her from falling, and pause, lost for a bit.

She won.\" As light returned to the room, Helena slowly removed the Mirrormask. She had looked beautiful in it, Valentine thought. Shiny, and certainly more natural. But it had also made her look rather more intimidating. Where was the logic in that? \"You know, I'm not really sure silver's your color,\" Valentine said, and turned away awkwardly when Helena glared at him. She leaned out the window a little. After that weird flash of darkness, everything outside had turned white. They seemed to be floating high above the clouds-or, more likely, the land beneath them had just been wiped clean. \"Everything's gone,\" Helena said quietly. She walked over to the staircase behind them and sat down heavily. \"She destroyed everything.\" \"Well, except for us,\" Valentine pointed out. \"Us and the tower. That's lucky, eh?\" Helena stared at the ground. Her dark eyes slowly widened, and she leapt to her feet. \"That's more than just lucky, Valentine! We're still here! That means she hasn't destroyed all of my drawings!\" She looked around, those odd eyes looking this way and that. \"I've drawn loads of windows, there must be one somewhere. All we've got to do is find it.\" She started running up the stairs, still clutching the Mirrormask. \"Hold on!\" Valentine said, running after her. \"Even if you could draw the windows, what you really need is a door.\" Helena paused. \"A door?\" \"Maybe that's why the window didn't work, see? Can't exactly crawl through a window when you're going between worlds. No, wouldn't be proper.\" She was staring at him with that face of hers, giving him that weird looked at feeling. Her dark eyes went wide again in what he guessed might be surprise? Or maybe amazement? In any case, she started running back down the stairs towards the front door. \"The front door!\" She yelled, and Valentine followed her back down the stairs. \"Maybe it's connected to the one on the roof-\" She nearly crashed into the front door, stopping herself with the hand that wasn't holding the mask. It had a shade pulled down over the window, and she yanked it up. Sure enough, there was a view of the apartment roof, weirdly vivid when she compared it to the dreamscape around her. \"Valentine, you're a genius!\" she said happily, throwing her arms around the skinny figure that had appeared behind her. \"Oh, well, it comes with the job,\" Valentine said modestly, patting her back. Helena laughed and went up on her tiptoes, kissing him swiftly on the mouth. But her laughter echoed behind her, and she released him so quickly that he almost thought it hadn't happened, but for the lingering tingle on his lips. He stumbled back and fell on his backside, sputtering. Helena had already turned back to the front door, holding the Mirrormask in both hands. She took one final glance at him. \"Goodbye, Valentine. And thank you.\" She opened the door and then slammed it again, and although Valentine couldn't see whatever was through the window, he could hear the Other Helena's voice. \"No! I'm not going back!\" \"This is my world!\" Real Helena said. \"No, I like it here! I just want a real life!\" \"Real life? You couldn't handle real life.\" And she lifted the mask to her face.

But nothing in all the Worlds is more powerful than Creation, and her sister Destruction. Helena did not realize at two, finger-painting with charcoal, that she was invoking a Power which would one day shape her dreams. She did not understand, at seven, that every drawing she made had a life of its own. So when, at fifteen, her Creations led her to another World...she remained blissfully ignorant for a time. But no ignorance lasts forever. Soon it became clear that this World of Light and Shadow was her world, Created from her drawings. Every scribble had hidden meanings, and Helena could sense a connection with every crack in the strange-yet-familiar pavement, every uncloudlike wisp in the sky. She knew, somehow, how to trick a sphinx, how to charm the giants. And no matter where she went in the World of Light and Shadow, she could sense the existence of the MirrorMask, though she searched fruitlessly for its exact location. Nothing in this World could completely surprise her. It did not shock Helena that the Light Queen was her mother who required waking. Nor that the Dark Queen was also her mother, although seeing all the worst things her mother could become was by far more disturbing. But when Helena realized that the Dark Princess was really in her world, yelling at her dad and tearing up her drawings one by one...that horror never completely left. Even after she found the MirrorMask, and sent the Dark Princess back to her rightful place in the World of Light and Shadow, Helena remained acutely aware of what the Dark Princess would have done to her life. And she hated it. It was not unreasonable for her to hate that possibility...after all, it was only through luck and magic that she was not stuck as the Dark Queen's pet. On that count, Helena was sorry. As much as the possibility of the Dark Princess ruining her life was hateful, Helena did not hate the Dark Princess, after all. No more than she hated the Dark Queen, or the sphinxes, or the Shadow itself. In the same way Helena could feel the pavement cracks and unknown paths of the World of Light and Shadow, she knew that they were each playing their Roles, doing what was natural. The World of Light and Shadow was partly her Creation, but Helena knew that there were levels of Creation active which were far beyond her own. As time wore on, and adventure receded into memory, one thing troubled her. At night she lay awake, wondering about the fate of Valentine and the Dark Princess. Did they escape together, in his tower? Did the Dark Queen recapture the Princess? Did she hurt Valentine? The last was most worrisome, because although Valentine had partly betrayed her, she knew somehow that he would not forget her name like he did the others. He came back for her, which he doubtless had never done before. He apologized to his tower. And Helena had a strong suspicion that he even managed to change the future he saw when he bit the Future Fruit. There were only waiters in her world, after all. So when, one normal night at the Big Top, she was tipped and caught by a boy with a face, Helena was very happy indeed. He might not know anything about the other World, and his other Self, but she did. She could not control what happened to Valentine in the World of Light and Shadow, but this world...in this world, things would turn out just fine.

Someone once told me that the scariest dreams are the ones you don't want to wake up from. She rebuilt it, after it had been ravaged by the other girl's anger. He then went on to tell me that he used to have nightmares about baking cakes for hours and then never getting to eat them. It had now been shifted into her trailer, and had grown like a striking black and white ivy with ink faces as flowers blossoming along its run; all the way around the walls of her circus bedroom. He said the cakes had little butterflies on them. Her favourite spot to sit and stare is on her bed, facing a wall filled with what she thinks of as an entertainment district. She hopes he likes it. He never made much sense for very long. I didn't really mind though, no matter how much I tried to pretend to. She purposely didn't ink in any jugglers; she thinks he would prefer to be a novelty act. She enjoyed drawing the All-You-Can-Eat Stand, though. Sometimes things he said come back to me and hit me in the face; things that are usually triggered by things I see. She could stare at that wall for hours. And she does; watching over her creation and willing it to move and prove to her that she's not insane, or stupid, or that it wasn't all a dream.

It starts during the events of the movie but soon moves on to events that occur after the film. Some slight Helena/Valentine or Helena/Val depending on how you want to look at it. Enjoy!- Disclaimer : Haven't, don't, and probably will never own Mirrormask. \" It's over. There's nothing left. She's won.\" It was black. Helena's breath sounded twice as loud as normal as she tried to look around. She'd failed. She didn't think she could fail; after all, this was supposed to be her dream. But here she was—was she anywhere anymore? A sudden chill clutched her stomach. \"Valentine? Valnetine!\" she shouted. She couldn't stand the thought of being alone in this pitch-black nowhere. What if . . . what if he had been destroyed too? \"Helena?\" Valentine answered. Helena almost sobbed with relief but quickly recovered. Valentine was fine. At least he was still there. \"Valentine, where are you?\" \"I . . . somewhere over here. Where are you?\" \"Here.\" Helena crouched down (or at least she thought it was down) and got on her hands and knees. The floor was tilted and she thought she could feel cool, cracked tiles. \"Valentine, keep talking. I'm going to try to make my way over to you.\" It was like a bad game of Marco Polo. She had to climb over what felt like a giant crease in the floor and at one point she hit her head against a pillar but eventually her hand met fabric. At almost the same time she felt something grab her shoulder. All the sudden she was enveloped in the fabric and her face was squished against something warm. She found herself hugging him just as desperately. \"What were you doing all the way over there?\" Valentine asked irritably. Helena felt herself smile. \"Yes, I'm not hurt. Thanks for asking.\" She felt his chest rumble. \"Fine. How are you Helena, on this fine Armageddon? \" \"Fine . . . not really.\" She buried her face further into his shirt. \"We failed.\" Valentine's voice lost all semblance of humor. \"Is it gone? The world? Permanently?\" Valentine whispered in her ear. \"I don't know,\" she whispered back. \"I'm here and you're here. Your tower seems to be here. I've still got the Mirrormask.\" The mask was cool in her hand. \"But I don't know what good it will do without a window.\" \"Right.\" There was again silence. But it wasn't really silence, Helena thought. She could hear Valentine breathing, feel his chest rising and falling. It was almost comforting. Almost. \"So,\" Valentine said. The vibrations from his chest tickled Helena's face. \"I don't suppose that book of yours has anything to say.\" Helena actually laughed. \"Can Valentines read in the dark?\" \"Ah,\" said Valentine, sounding smug. He let go of Helena and she heard a rustling of fabric. Suddenly there was a bright light. Helena's hand flew up towards her eyes. \"Oh, sorry.\" Valentine turned the light to look around the room. \"My poor tower!\" he whined. \"Look what she's done to it!\" It looked like the Princess had taken the tower and crumpled it up into a ball. The walls were making all sorts of odd angles, plaster occasionally cascading down to the floor which was in an equal state of ruin. As Valentine moaned about his damaged tower Helena fished for the Really Useful Book . Finding it, she opened the book to the only remaining page. \" Remember what your mother said.\" \"It says the same thing,\" she told Valentine. \"Just about remembering what my mum said.\" \"Did she say what to do when the world has ended?\" \"No, I don't think so.\" Helena turned the page and looked at the back side. \" Every cloud has a silver lining.\" She read the line out loud. \"Valentine, hand me the flashlight.\" She took it and carefully standing, she crawled towards the nearest window. Leaning on the windowsill, she shined the light over the landscape. It resembled Valentine's tower, wrinkled and bent. As the light flashed over what was left of the world, she saw nothing but dead, brown land; there wasn't even a sky anymore. Valentine joined her at the window. \"Once again, your book proves to be perfect rubbish.\" The book flapped weakly in protest. \"It's been very helpful up till now,\" defended Helena. \"We've got to think positive.\" That's when the batteries in the flashlight started to die. Helena shook the flashlight but the only source of light in the world began to dim. Valentine moved closer and they sank to the floor as the light faded out. They were in the dark once again. \" Stupid book!\" Valentine shouted. \"Valentine.\" \"It's like some sort of bad joke!\" \"There's no use shouting about it!\" Helena shouted back. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" said Valentine, sarcasm dripping from his voice. \"I should just sit calmly and take the end of the world in stride!\" \"That's how you deal with crises, isn't it? 'Onwards and upwards' and all that!\" \"It happens to be a very good motto!\" Helena took a deep breath to shout at him again and stopped short. This was how it all began, wasn't it? Shouting over a stupid argument. Saying things that she later regretted. \"You'll be the death of me.\" \"I wish I was.\" She took another deep breath, this time to calm her anger. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout. I'm just scared I guess.\" There was a pause. Then Valentine whispered, \"Yeah, me too.\" \"What, the being scared or the being sorry?\" \"Maybe . . . possibly a little, teensy bit of both.\" A small smile crept onto Helena's face. \"So it takes the end of the world to get a sort of apology from a Valentine.\" Helena fiddled with the hem of her dress as she continued, \"I really am glad that you came with me. And especially now; I don't know what I'd do if I was alone here.\" \"Yeah, I suppose we've always got each other and all that other sappy nonsense.\" Helena felt a large warm hand take hers. \"Juggling partners to the end, right?\" Valentine's voice was light with forced humor. Helena squeezed his hand. \"To the end. Although I'm still not sure about you being my manager.\" She heard him chuckle. Then a light appeared. The silver band hit the opposite wall and Valentine and Helena scrambled up to look through the window above him. Valentine saw what looked like a very large sliver moon in the sky. Helena saw her . \"The window,\" Helena breathed. She turned excitedly back to Valentine. \"The window I drew on the door! On the roof! She missed it!\" Helena excitedly took the Mirrormask in hand and stared through the window intently. XXXXX Valentine never could see what she saw in the windows. But after finding the Princess' letter he knew something was there, something he could neither see nor hear nor touch. A different world, the one she came from. He had gotten a brief glimpse when he ate the future fruit; to him it appeared to mostly consist of waiters, mean managers, and crashing plates. As Helena held the Mirrormask and looked through the last window in the world, Valentine found himself wishing fervently that for a moment he could see what she was seeing. He listened to Helena's one-sided conversation, a whirlwind in his mind. \"This is my world!\" she told the window. \"Real life? You couldn't handle real life.\" Then she put the mask on. The whole world rippled and waved. A clear ringing sounded and Valentine felt like he was floating in pudding as colors and shapes blurred around him. He had just enough time to start to panic before things started to settle. He had to blink in the sudden light. The world was brighter than he remembered it being in a long time. Glancing out the window he saw a bright blue sky and the land back to normal. Somewhere in the distance was a bright object; the City of Light, probably the palace. He grinned like mad and laughed. \"We did it! We actually did it!\" Valentine lifted his hands in joy. \"We saved the world!\" He turned and saw Helena asleep on the floor. Tossing back his robe, Valentine crouched beside the sleeping figure. He gently shook her shoulder. \"Helena? Wakey, wakey! We have a world-saving to celebrate! And we have your contract with me to iron out.\" Helena stirred, opened her eyes blearily and looked around, becoming more and more confused and upset. When her eyes fell on Valentine, her face went livid. Valentine felt his smile drop like a falling tower. This wasn't Helena. \"NO!\" the Princess screamed, slamming the floor with her fist. \"I don't want to be here!\" Valentine stood and hastily backed as far away from the Princess as he could. His heart was hammering a thousand times per minute. This definitely wasn't Helena. She didn't even look like Helena now that Valentine was really looking at her. The Princess stood up and looked out the window. Stomping her foot, she screamed. \"That girl! That horrid, bloody . . . girl !\" Then she whirled around to face Valentine. \"You! Tell me where I am! Now!\" No, nothing like Helena at all. Valentine found he was rather hating this Princess girl. \"In my tower,\" he said with a frown. \"But we'll be at the Dark Palace very shortly.\" He felt his tower change direction as he said this, making its way hastily to the Dark Lands. \"But I don't want to go home!\" the Princess yelled. \"Must you always shout?\" he asked. \"I didn't want Helena replaced with some—some whiney, spoiled, horrid little girl!\" This was true he realized. As the girl sat down and began to cry pitifully, Valentine left the room, going up the stairs to his own bedroom. He couldn't stand to be anywhere near that Helena-wannabe. He wasn't sure what he had expected the Mirrormask to do; he supposed in some roundabout way he knew Helena had to go back to her own world, but not right that second! All the things he hadn't said floated through his mind: he never apologized, not really and he got the feeling that he probably, well, very likely owed her one. A real one. Not the dance around the words he had given her. The mask didn't even allow for him to say goodbye. Somewhere in the far back of his mind, a small voice whined he had lost yet another juggling partner, but most of his mind was dominated by an emptiness. \"Onwards and upwards,\" he murmured without any real feeling. When he got to his bedroom he immediately walked over to the window and stared out at the passing clouds, wishing he could see a bedroom with a moon mask, a little cuddly sea anemone, and most importantly a girl with short brown hair and laughing eyes. He wouldn't even mind the bunny slippers. XXXX As soon as they were allowed to see her mum, Helena couldn't wait to tell her about the weird dream she had on the night of the surgery. She was bouncing up and down as practically the whole circus crowded into the hospital room, bringing flowers, cards, fruit, and several small juggling acts (though the nurses soon put a stop to that). Eventually things died down and most of the circus people left. After all, Helena's dad had decided to take the circus back on the road and there was much packing to do. Soon there was only Helena, her mum and her dad. Then even her dad left to go talk to the doctor about paperwork and Helena finally got the chance to talk with her mum alone. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Helena held her mother's hand. \"Aw, mum, I've got to tell you about this amazing dream I had.\" \"What a coincidence, I wanted to tell you about a dream I had,\" her mum said, smiling. She looked pale still, but much better than before the surgery. Still, Helena could tell she was tired already and that the nurses would soon shoo all the visitors away. Helena smiled. \"You first.\" Her mum's smile turned almost bashful. \"It was such an odd dream, luv. I was only me for part of it. I also seemed to be some sort of queen, dressed all in white and silver and gold.\" She laughed. \"My hair was long and white too. I must have been a very old queen, hm?\" Helena tried not to let her smile falter under her surprise. \"So, what did your highness do?\" \"Well, you were there. But I'm not sure where exactly there was, or even what it was. You know how places shift and change in dreams?\" Helena nodded. \"It was like that. At one point we were on a bus, and at another point we were in your room, only there was nothing in there but a lamp on the floor and your drawings on the wall. There was also some sort of place with a pool—but that will come later. You were in your jammies,\" her mum said, laughing. \"And I was asking you about something you had lost. You told me you were looking for some sort of mask, a-a mirror mask, I think. Something like that anyway. And I asked you who had it last and all my usual questions. I said something about the dream being very odd and you replied that it was your dream. Then, all the sudden we were by this pool I was telling you about and there was a young man there in a baggy robe and wearing a mask.\" Helena's heart flip flopped. \"What did the mask look like?\" she asked quickly. \"Well, it was sort of beige with a purple or maroon stripe down the middle. I'm not sure, whole area had a hazy color to it. Oh, and there were small spikes on the top,\" her mum declared triumphantly, proud to have remembered such a detail. \"It looked kind of like that spiky thing kids do with their hair these days, with lots of gel. Are you alright, luv? You look a little worried.\" Helena quickly put the smile back in place. \"No, no, mum, I'm fine. Please, continue.\" \"Alright, but there's not much more to tell. I asked you if he was your boyfriend and you got all cute and flustered.\" Helena's mum smiled, obviously greatly amused. \"Then I said that the mask thing you were looking for was probably staring you right in the face. And that was it. Next thing I know, I'm waking up and the surgery is over.\" Nodding, Helena tried to be nonchalant. \"Well, that is a very interesting dream. Fancy, a masked man. Sounds like it should have been my dream after all.\" She and her mum both laughed. True to Helena's predictions the nurses came in to tell Helena that her mum needed her rest. On the way home on the bus, Helena glanced out the window and wished very hard that she would see that masked man staring back. XXXX That night, once she heard the TV turned off and her dad's soft snoring, Helena got out of bed. The clock said it was around 1:48 am. She quickly pulled a sweater over her nightshirt and stuffed her feet into real shoes this time (Valentine's voice echoed in her head: What the hell have you got on your feet? ). Grabbing a flashlight, extra batteries, a blank journal (in case the sphinxes got hungry again), and a small knapsack, she quietly opened her bedroom door and snuck out of the apartment. She reached the ally only to find a dead end. When her dad asked her the next morning why her eyes were so red, Helena simply said she had a rough night sleeping. XXXX Valentine woke up when he heard someone knocking. Jumping out of bed, he ran down the stairs and quickly opened the Tower's front door. He wasn't sure why he felt disappointed when it only turned out to be the mailman. \"Special delivery for a Mr. Valentine,\" the postman's envelope mouth said. \"I'm Valentine.\" The mailman handed over a small envelope with silver ink writing: Valentine, Tower, Lands of Light . \"Special summons from the queen! Very special indeed, sir.\" \"Yes, well, I am a very important man,\" Valentine mumbled distractedly. He was about to open the letter when he found the mailman still in his doorway, curiously trying to see what was inside the envelope. \"Don't you have mail to deliver or something?\" \"Huh? Oh, erm, yes, of course. Good day, sir. As always, a slight gesture of appreciation is always, well, appreciated!\" The mailman held out his hand suggestively. Valentine forced a smile. \"Ah, yes, of course.\" He grabbed the postman's hand, shook it once and said. \"Thanks!\" He then slammed the door in the mailman's face. The Tower quickly flew off and left the disgruntled mailman behind. Inside, Valentine tore open the letter, letting the envelope drop to the floor. \"Royal summons?\" He looked up at nothing in particular. \"Well, Tower, it seems that we've been invited to meet the Queen. What do you think of that, eh?\" The building creaked. \"Um.\" Valentine looked down at the letter again. \"It says you can land right outside the palace.\" He felt the Tower change directions. It didn't even occur to Valentine that maybe he'd want to dress for the occasion or even attempt to straighten his bed hair until he was walking up the palace steps and saw the Prime Minister walking down towards him. \"Ah, Mr. Valentine, welcome, welcome!\" the Prime Minister said, taking Valentine's hand and giving it a friendly shape. \"Absolute pleasure to see you now that the world isn't being plagued by Shadows.\" Valentine opened his mouth to say something but the Prime Minister continued. \"Now, come inside. The Queen wants to see you.\" With that the Prime Minister started up the stairs once more, silver robe shimmering in the sunlight. Valentine followed. They eventually came into a room that was made mostly of windows. It was very tall though not very wide. There were some plants growing along the corners and in the middle was a little silver fountain, a small white table loaded with plates of little cakes, and two white chairs. One was occupied. \"Valentine, good to meet you. Please, have a seat,\" the White Queen said, motioning to the empty chair. Valentine might have run away then and there out of sheer nerves if it hadn't been for those delicious-looking cakes. He sat down. \"I'll just be going now, Your Majesty,\" the Prime Minister said, giving a small smile. \"Alright, luv. If you must.\" The Queen smiled, kissed her finger and turned it towards the Prime Minister in a sort of 'air kiss.' The Prime Minister smiled. Valentine looked awkwardly down at his shoes. Soon he heard the door close and could practically feel the Queen's attention focus on him. \"Please, help yourself to the cakes. I insist,\" she said at last. \"Yes, Your Majesty.\" Oddly enough, the cakes helped. Valentine felt himself relaxing as the sweet icing melted on his tongue. \"I wanted to thank you in person,\" continued the Queen, taking one of the cakes for herself. \"After all, it's not every day that I'm rescued by someone I've never met.\" \"Well, I do my best,\" Valentine said, feeling completely at ease now. He took another two cakes. \"Though, Helena deserves some of the credit too.\" A white cream filled cake paused half way to his mouth. Did he really just say . . .? He hadn't spoken her name since she left. He hadn't even thought it. He made a point not to. Onwards and upwards . The cake finished its journey but somehow it wasn't as sweet as the others. The Queen watched with interest. \"Naturally,\" she said. \"But don't underestimate your own importance, Valentine.\" Valentine could practically hear Helena's laughter at that from where he sat. \"Never do,\" he mumbled. \"I was wondering what you'd like as a reward.\" At that, Valentine met the Queen's eyes. \"Reward? As in, jewels?\" \"Anything you want,\" shrugged the Queen, taking another cake. \"A party, jewels, a feast.\" Her eyes crinkled as she looked at the mostly empty plates on the table. \"Whatever is in my power, I will do.\" \" We'll bath in . . . fish! Eat our own weight in chocolate buttons.\" Her laugh. \" Learn to play the concertina!\" \" Now, I definitely don't need a manager.\" \" Juggling partners to the end, right?\" Her hand squeezing his. \"To the end. Though I'm still not sure about you being my manager.\" \"What about Helena?\" The words were out before he could stop them. He frowned at his own mouth. The Queen looked slightly saddened. \"I wish there was some way I could repay her. But she's in her own world now.\" Valentine's frown deepened. \"Can't you talk to her through the Mirrormask?\" He paused. \"Whatever happened to the Mirrormask anyway?\" \"The Mirrormask is back where it was before the Dark Princess came,\" the Queen answered. Valentine noticed how she evaded actually answering; after all, he was an expert at avoiding certain words and phrases. \"As for using it, it's nothing to be done lightly. The Mirrormask keeps the world in balance. By using it, even a little, that balance is broken.\" \"You mean the world would start ending again?\" A small smile played on the edges of the Queen's lips. \"Not necessarily. The consequence could be as small as opening a door to nowhere. Remember, it was the Dark Princess who was destroying the world.\" Then her look turned serious. \"Is that what you want? To use the Mirrormask?\" \". . . Will I have to go on a dangerous quest to get it?\" XXXX She drew him a window, a special one surrounded by juggling balls, cakes, jewels, and all those things he liked. His tower hovered near one corner and his robe was draped on another. She added a couple of flying fish for good measure. All it needed was his face in it. Helena taped the drawing onto the mirror insider her camper. And she waited. Every day when his face didn't appear, it hurt less and less. But that didn't mean that it didn't hurt at all. After a while when her mom got out of the hospital and the circus started to pick up again, she stopped looking all together. XXXX It took him seventeen and a half tries to get the mask anywhere near his face. Then he set it aside and told himself he would try again in the morning. XXXX She knew it was a dream; it didn't feel nearly as real as her Dream in the MirrorRelm and she wasn't in her pajamas this time. Still, he was there and he seemed real enough, or as real as people can seem when you're in dream. \" You haven't looked through the window even once,\" she accused. A school of fish flew by. \" Well, you left without saying goodbye.\" Helena was going to defend herself but the scene changed and so did he, slightly. Was this the bus to the hospital? \" Is this what I look like in your world?\" he asked. \"Disgusting, I can feel my face moving.\" She couldn't help but smile at that. \"He sounds a bit like you. I ran into—well, he ran into me, actually.\" \" Ah, can't be me then, can it? Valentine's are never clumsy.\" Scene change and Valentine was back to normal. Or was that back to not normal? \" I tried to get back, through the alley,\" she said. She pointed. \"But there wasn't a door there this time.\" \" Well, you didn't draw one, did you?\" Helena thought about that. \"How did you get through to my world in the first place?\" Valentine looked confused. \"I'm not sure, me and . . . what's-his-name just sort of . . . walked there. We were looking for a secret place to practice so no one could steal my ideas.\" The scene changed again. Her bedroom—or was it the Princess' bedroom? \" I drew you a window,\" Helena told him. \" Ah. Yes, well, I've had a bit of trouble using the Mirrormask.\" Helena frowned. \"It doesn't work for you?\" \" It's . . . not that exactly. I just . . . haven't gotten around to actually trying it yet.\" \" Why not? I thought you wanted to see me.\" \" Of course I do! I just didn't want to get—\" Valentine made some odd motion with his hands, \"—sucked into your world, now did I? It's too strange a place, all those moving faces and stationary buildings.\" \" The mask concentrates your desires. It gives you what you need,\" quoted Helena. \" That's all fine and dandy but I don't need to be there , I need you to be here .\" Helena felt surprised and then smiled. \"Why, Valentine, that's the most romantic thing you've said to me all dream,\" she said in a high pitched voice. Valentine smiled. \"Don't expect that too often. If this weren't a dream I wouldn't have said it at all.\" \" Don't tell me: this is your dream?\" \" Of course. How else would I be seeing you?\" Helena decided to leave it. \"So you want me to come back to the . . . dream world.\" \" MirrorRelm is what the queen called it. And yes, it would be much more convenient for you to come back here than for me to go to your strange world.\" \" But you have the Mirrormask.\" \" I'll just give the mask to you.\" And somehow he had it in his hands. \"Here.\" The mask felt more real than Helena herself. But somehow as soon as she touched it she felt more real and everything else started to fade . . . XXXX She woke up earlier than normal. When she glanced over at her alarm clock it told her it was about 4:53 in the morning. She groaned, decided to go back to sleep (she felt half asleep anyway), and tried to lie back down. Something was poking her in the stomach. She took the Mirrormask, stuffed it under her bed grumpily and soon found herself in much more normal dreams. XXXX He couldn't believe he had lost it. True, he wasn't the neatest person in the Lands of Light, but he didn't lose important things. Well, not often. He was currently tearing the sheets off his bed when his strange dream came back to him. She had taken the Mirrormask right before he woke up. But that was a dream! . . . Right? Hadn't Helena called the MirrorRelm a dream when she first came? Valentine walked out onto the Tower's balcony and looked over the lands below. Part of his mind watched the lands grow and change and another part thought deep, philosophical things. It wasn't much of a stretch to think she had physically taken the mask from a dream, was it? After all, hadn't she created this place in the first place? All that deep thought made his brain hurt. So he just watched some monkeybirds instead. XXXX XXXX As Helena got dressed later that morning, she wondered about the dream she had. She didn't remember much except for Valentine—he had definitely been there but she couldn't remember what they had been talking about . . . something important? Stepping out of her trailer, Helena rubbed her eyes. Ug, not enough sleep . She walked around the skeleton of the circus tent, thinking about what had brought that dream about. She hadn't had dreams about the MirrorRelm since she first dreamed it up. Then all the sudden Valentine appears? What brought that about? Then she turned the corner and remembered. Right, him . She had only seen the anti-Valentine once yesterday, but it had been enough. He came to audition and she had seen him passing by while she was practicing. He had given her a little wave and she had given him a little smile. Then he had come over to her and asked directions to her dad's trailer. Catching the last of juggling balls, Helena showed him the way. \"By the way, you were great last night. That was you, right? Juggling during the gorilla scene?\" Helena smiled. \"Maybe. You'll have to join the circus to actually find out who's behind the masks.\" They were at her dad's trailer then so she wished him luck and left and didn't see him again the rest of the day. Seeing him now brought the whole dream back to her. \"Ah, can't be me then, can it? Valentine's are never clumsy.\" The Anti-Valentine smiled at her which made her heart jerk in a weird way. \"Hey,\" he said. \"Uh, you know, I never caught your name.\" Smiling, Helena replied. \"Helena. Rather dull, isn't it?\" \"No! I-I think it's a rather lovely name.\" Nope, definitely wasn't Valentine. \"So, what's your name then?\" \"Val.\" Helena pretended to give it some thought. \"Dignity and style, mixed with a bit of romance . . .\" She smiled. \"I like it. So, got a callback did you?\" Val's expression turned from confused to happy. \"Yeah!\" he said, positively grinning. \"The man in charge of the circus—\" \"My dad.\" Val stared at her for a moment. \"Is there anyone in this circus you're not related to?\" He sounded so much like Valentine when he said that Helena couldn't help but laugh. \"I'm not related to most of them. My mum and dad just run the circus.\" Val's mouth formed an 'o.' Then he nodded and continued, \"Well, the very kind man in charge of the circus said I had some potential.\" \"Good. Glad to hear it.\" Helena saw her dad coming over from behind Val's shoulder. \"Ah, and speaking of my dad.\" Mr. Campbell walked over and patted Val on the back. \"Ah, perfect timing. I was just going to look for Helena and ask her to do a quick practice with you.\" It turned out he could juggle too. He wasn't Valentine. But did she really want him to be? XXXX Helena got back to her trailer rather late. She plopped down on the bed without bothering to change and stared at the drawings on her wall. It seemed static. But was it? She turned her head to look at the mirror with Valentine's window on it. No face appeared. Then Helena narrowed her eyes. She was pretty sure those cakes had been whole when she drew them; she would remember drawing bits out of them, right? Her dream came back to her. Trying to prevent herself from getting too excited, Helena pulled herself forward on the bed and looked underneath. A silver mask reflected her face back at her. XXXX She used the window she had made for him. So she supposed she shouldn't have been surprised to find herself in his tower. Putting the Mirrormask in her shoulder bag, she looked around the room. Suddenly, a door creaked open. \"Oh, um, thanks,\" she told the building, hoping she wasn't making a fool of herself. She walked through the open door and saw Valentine standing on a balcony. He turned, grinned, and then tried to force said grin into a scowl. \"I don't know what kind of time you'd call this,\" he said. \"Running off on me without so much as a goodbye. Leaving me to clean up your mess. Do you have any idea how annoying that Princess girl was? Why, I'm almost tempted to break our contract.\" Helena smiled. \"Missed you too, Valentine.\" -A/N: Tadaa!

Although, it was hard to tell in the Land of Shadows, but when you have lived there all your life you become accustomed to the lighting. Estella was a girl of fifteen sitting in her bedroom awaiting her dinner of ice cream. The bedroom door swung open quietly as a platypus-like creature entered carrying a tray of sweets. \"The Queen is sorry that she cannot dine with you this evening, so you shall be having to eat in your room tonight.\" \"Dearest Grandmama is so kind. Send her my thank yous and my love.\" The girl requested of the creature as he set the platters on the small table near the window. With a nod, he left the girl to her meal. I do not mind eating alone. I prefer to look out the window anyways, She thought to herself, the world is so different outside . As the girl ate her ice cream, the Queen watched her from the door where there were eye-holes placed perfectly for seeing inside. The Queen smiled, knowing her granddaughter was happily doing what she pleased and turned back towards the meeting in the hall. There were creatures of all sizes and features here tonight that have come to pay tribute to the Queen for the safety of their lands in the Land of Shadows. There were rock creatures of the Hills, Swampbark creatures that inhabited the Swamps, and numerous others that held smaller cities and villages in the Land. \"I would like to thank you all for coming today, but I need for you to leave, since I have other matters to tend to today that are important for the Princess and I.\" With a slight nod, the Queen turned away and headed off toward her bed chamber where there was to be a guest awaiting her. The moon was almost full, and like all moons before, the man would come to question the Queen and talk about her granddaughter. She found these talks tiring and often had him leave within the hour because there was no point in letting this man know so much about the Princess. She liked to keep her personal matters secret and to herself. Especially after her . \"Hello, your majesty.\" The man bowed deeply as she entered her chamber. The Queen nodded and sat on her bed while gesturing for the man to sit on the chair opposite her. \"As always, I have come to ask about Estella's health and wellness. Is she behaving properly?\" \"Estella always behaves properly, Eric. You never need to worry about that. She plays with her dolls like a good little girl and has proper manners when speaking and in public as usual,\" The Queen answered dismissively. \"However, this meeting will be about my own conditions Eric.\" \"Yes?\" Eric sat straighter, the worry he felt was clear on his mouth even though his mask kept his face a secret to the world. \"I would prefer that you shall not come around any longer. You have served your purpose well with bearing my Estella, but I no longer need you. I have been patient and have given you fifteen years of life when I should have given you none.\" \"Your majesty, may I ask one more thing–\" \"No, you may not. I shall not have Estella perform the same actions as her mother had all those years ago. She is the daughter that I have longed for and she is the perfect daughter for the role of the Princess. Now, you know what is to be expected of your last task, do you not?\" Eric nodded, and the guards of metal dragged him away by the arms to be executed. The Queen had never liked men, they always had a thirst for power and sought to control women. Eric performed his duty with concieving Estella with her daughter, but once the girl was born her mother disappeared. No one could find her anywhere and so Estella became the new Princess of the Land of Shadows under her grandmother. The Queen looked at herself in the mirror, with her mask of feathers to hide her aging look and her long dress of dark satin. Fifteen years...that was the age when her daughter decided to take the world into her own hands and try to ruin it. She could not let Estella do the same, not for the world's safety, but for her own. Helena was a wonderful daughter while she stayed in the Land of Shadows all those years ago, even if she was not the real daughter of the Queen. Estella was formed from that girl Helena, with her proper speaking and attitude, but with the mind set that she was to always please the Queen.

I loved the film but always thought that Helena/valentine should off happened. I hope you like it. ~Jezz I felt his arms on my shoulders as I spun in panic; he swiftly caught a single ball before it landed on the deadened, trampled grass. I looked up in shock, he had leafy green eyes and ruffled blown-y blonde hair. I felt I knew him, and when he spoke I felt a pang of happiness. I had missed Valentine, as much as it surprised me. My heart hurt and my chest felt tight when I thought about him, it was both a known and unknown feeling. I recognised it from when mum had gone to hospital but I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt this with anyone other than family and even then it wasn't exactly the same. Then Helena spoke to him, then she realised he wasn't the same. When she had made the comment about being a waiter he had laughed, and she thought that it was definitely him but after the laughter had faded he broke her heart with a single word. His eye brows furrowed as he murmured \"what?\" It wasn't him. Her Valentine, he just reminded her of him. She shook her head and momentarily shut her eyes to hold back sad, angry tears that were threatening to spill. \"Never mind,\" she managed to speak, her voice wavering. She turned and strode up the line to her mom and turned her head so others couldn't see the red flush on her cheeks and the sparkling film of sadness in her eyes. Joanne peered surprized at her daughter's reaction to the tall (and rather cute) young man. Why had Helena gotten so upset, she'd heard the little conversation, and other than Helena's strange comment about a waiter, she couldn't see what was wrong. Joanne looked again up to the man who was now walking away, he reminded her of a man she'd once dreamed up for Helena. An imaginary boyfriend, she'd called him. Helena walked hurriedly up to the booth Joanne was in. \"Don't let him stay\" Helena whispered frantically, \"Say no, say he's not what you're looking for, that he's not good enough, that you've got a juggler! Anything! Please!\" Helena's eyes were streaming now and her voice cracking as she pleaded. \"Why dear? You looked happy when you first saw him. Why are you so upset?\" Joanne asked sadly as she waved over another performer to take the booth as she pulled Helena into a tent. \"He just looks like someone I knew, and I can't see him anymore. Please! If you value my sanity, please don't let him come with us!\" \"Who does he remind you of Helena; I've never seen you with a boy.\" Joanne felt her brow crunching in concern at her daughter's pain-filled expression. \"You don't know him, you never got to meat.\" Helena's face was now cast down as the tears fell heavy and fast, dripping onto the dusty, hard mud ground. \"Cuz he don't exist.\" She heard Helena murmur to herself but Joanna still heard it faintly. \"What do you mean 'don't exist'.\" Joanne said. This was ridiculous! How could she be this upset and say that the reason is because some boy looks like someone who doesn't even exist?! \"I met him in a dream! Okay?\" Joanne raised her eyebrows in surprise, she could chance it. Say about the boyfriend she dreamed up and risk looking like a lunatic, but this was Helena, she was basically made up of silly make-believe. \"The boyfriend I dreamed up. That you insisted wasn't your boyfriend.\" She said hesitantly. \"You.\" Helena stopped, \"You were actually there?\" Helena asked surprized, her voice getting higher in pitch with every word. \"I don't know where 'there' is, but I had a dream that I was on a plain bit of white land. A big circle of water was in the middle and your drawings were all over the walls. You and some masked man were there and you started talking to me. That's really it.\" Joanna said strangely, she had no idea what to make of this all. \"MUM!\" Helena said happily. Helena was shocked, she was so sure that it had actually been a dream, but her mum seemed to remember the experience. \"Mum I drew that place, you were there, and I did talk to you!\" Helena tried to squash her hopes down, what if it had been some weird coincidence. That she couldn't go back. She didn't want to get happy for no reason. \"Helena, I'm curious, could you show me the drawings?\" Helena was fast in her reaction; she grabbed onto her mum's forearm and pulled her towards her trailer. When they got inside her mum inspected the wall, the little drawings of black ink that completely covered one side of her trailer. \"Helena, what if that wasn't a dream?\" I hoped with all my heart that it wasn't, but things like that just don't happen. \"Mum I has to be a dream, that only makes sense.\" She said sadly. \"Well Helena, there's a little note written here that says 'Visit any chance you get.' It's signed with a V\" Helena rushed over, and there, on the wall was indeed a note, written in sharp pointy writing. The grin that erupted over her face was uncontrollable and hurt her cheeks with its intensity. She hugged her mum with all the strength she could muster. She had been back from her world for about six months and she missed all of it so intensely. With her arms still wrapped around her mum, her face pressed into her shoulder and her eyes scrunched shut, she laughed with relief. \"Helena.\" Her mum said. She looked up; her mum had a small smile ghosted on her lips. \"When you go back, Make sure he looks after you. I can see how you feel for him. Even if you can't.\" Helena kissed her mum and smiled even harder. \"I'll explain to your father, he'll be happy you can live your dream like he does his. Come back if a couple of days so we know you're okay.\" Helena was so happy she could have cried. Joanna watched as her daughter, beaming with joy, packed a small bag, changed and (after frantically searching the room) grabbed a strange metal mask from under her bed. \"So\" Joanne said. \"How does it work then? How do you get there?\" she asked. Helena kissed her goodbye and just told her to watch. She called for her dad, so Joanne's explanation would be more believable. Then Joanne and Morris watched as their only daughter placed the metal mask over her face and suddenly jolted and slowly melded with the long bedroom mirror; In to her own world. Helena landed in an odd patch of grass, right in the middle of a street. She stood up and brushed herself down before pulling the bag over her shoulder and spinning a full 360 to see where she was. Helena recognised it as close to orbiting giants. She has checked all her locations on her wall after she had woken back in the normal world. Helena slowly made her way in the direction of the queen of light's castle. She wanted to see if she had woken up okay but also to see if she knew where Valentine was. As she made her way up the steps of the castle she hoped she wouldn't have any problems getting inside, the castle was magnificent, better and more detailed than she had drawn it. As she made her way inside she gazed at all the walls, she had imagined it like this but it was far more impressive to actually be there, that was when she saw the queen making her way down the delicate white stairs. \"Um\" Helena said, unsure of how to address a queen. \"Helena! What a welcome surprize, I owe you much for waking me but you had left before I could.\" The queen smiled lightly. \"It was a pleasure, I'm happy you're okay again! Is the realm doing well?\" Helena asked, genuinely interested, after all I was her world. \"It is doing magnificent thanks to you. I also note that more of the light realm is being created and the dark realm being tamed, I think we have you, as our creator, to thank for that.\" The queen seemed to glow with happiness. \"You don't need to thank me, I enjoy it. I was wondering if you might know where Valentine is.\" Helena felt it strange that she had to smother a blush at having to ask the queen that. \"Helena, you are the creator, if anyone knows. It will be you.\" Helena had no idea what to do; she shut her eyes hoping that might help. To her frustration and embarrassment when she opened her eyes she still had little clue as to where he may be. \"I...I don't…I don't know where he is!\" she said with annoyance in her voice, she just wanted to see him! Why couldn't she just DO that?! \"Calm yourself dear, slow your breathing. You've made everything, everything here is yours. Picture it. You know this place; you created this world from nothing. Everything you need to know is inside yourself; you are stronger and more powerful than you know, especially here.\" Helena felt the wisdom of her words, her eyes slid shut as her breathing slowed. She could here millions of words in her head, the whispers teased her ears. Soft voices told her things, told her who she was. She is the queen of dreams; she herself has created a world in which she could live. \"I know where he is.\" Helena heard herself, she sounded so sure but she had no idea why, just like she had no explanation as to why she knew what she knew. \"Thank you!\" Helena almost shouted at the queen of light. \"My pleasure my dear.\" Was all she said before basically pushing her out of the castle wishing her good-luck the entire time. Helena jogged down the dry, cracked stone steps into the courtyard. She started to run, faster and faster through the streets, following her mind like a map. She stopped and bent down; she tried to even her breath to slow her fast beating heart and calm her nerves. Helena pulled her flash light out of her bag and looked up in time to catch his tower floating overhead. Waving the light and jumping up and down in desperation she called his name. Valentine! She shouted in her mind. Please! Just let the tower land! She watched as the tower glided lower and lower towards the ground like a bird as it gracefully landed on its single leg between the buildings. Helena stood expectantly, her arms flopping to her sides and she waited. She heard his heavily accented voice first and she smiles gingerly, \"who the hell do you think you are flagging down my tower! I'm a very important man you know.\" It was as he said the last word he stepped out, it took all her strength not to shout his name, but that did not stop the tears from threating to spill over her lids and cascade down her face. She took a shaky breath as he looked up. \"Helena.\" He said suddenly, she could almost hear the smile in that single word. \"I got your note a bit late. Sorry.\" She said happily, she started to walk slowly towards him as he did the same. They were soon running full force until he swept her off her feet in a tight embrace. \"Hey.\" He murmured into her hair, \"Hey yourself.\" She answered immediately. \"Good to see you. It's been a while.\" He whispered sadly. \"I didn't know if this place still existed. That it wasn't just a dream.\" He put her back on her feet as he grabbed her shoulders and pushed her to arm's length. \"Me? A dream! No one could dream up me! I'm a very important man! I have a tower, you know.\" He smiled at her and winked, she laughed and with it, all the anxious, curdling tight feelings in her chest left and was replaced with just a light feeling of euphoria and just plain and pure happiness. Helena breathed in deep and looked up to the cloudy sky. The foggy, grey swirls of cotton slowly dissipated to leave a magnificent blue sky, pinks and reds and oranges bled into the blue, merging into a beautiful mess. \"I missed you, you giant dolt.\" She said affectionately, he just smiled down at her. Valentine felt if he were any happier he might just explode with it. She had left and he didn't expect her to come back, but he left the note anyway, just so he wouldn't lose hope. That she might notice some day and come back. He felt strange inside, butterflies in his stomach raged at an alarming rate when he saw her. His chest hurt unbearably but he couldn't care less, he felt so complete when he took her within his arms and spun in large circles before just stopping to hold her. When she looked up she had looked so magical, the clouds practically parted at her gaze and the golden sunlight beamed onto her skin. She looked like she was glowing from the inside, her eyes molten gold slowly cooling back to the warm chocolate he adored so much. She had changed while she's been away, she was slightly taller. As much as he tried to not notice it, she had gotten more curves, her hips wider and rounded and her chest bigger and hair longer. Helena shifted while she admired his strong arms on her, she felt fluttery, like she was leaving her body. The world spun on it axis and the ground suddenly started to come closer, and then she was in Valentine's arms. She could see him speaking but everything was muffled, like she was in another room. Then everything settled again, she shook her head and smiled up to Valentine. \"I'm okay, I'm okay.\" She said to him but he still looked concerned. He helped her up, \"what just happened!\" he said frantically, still clutching her arm. \"Really, I have no idea, I'm alright now though.\" He bobbed his head and he relaxed and asked her what she wanted to do now, \"I am, after all, your manager\" he added on the end. She barked a light laugh and they walked across the bridge towards the tower. \"Well. Depends. What's been going on lately.\" She asked. \" Well. \" He copied, \"The dark queen is getting more desperate as the light realm gets stronger, and she and her daughter have been making attacks. Regularly .\" He said in an almost teasing tone. \"Couldn't afford to mess with her at ALL could we now.\" Helena said in an equally teasing tone. He laughed. The tower took off and Helena and Valentine made their way to the window. \"Do you see your room still?\" He asked. \"Only when I want to now, it's strange because I could never do it before.\" He nodded, \" freakyyyy.\" He said in a silly tone, Helena slapped him lightly on the arm and called him and idiot. \"I see you're not wearing those abominable rabbit shoes anymore.\" He commented. Helena laughed, \"I do have them with me, I just thought it might be smarter to wear more durable shoes if I'm going to stay here longer.\" Valentine looked sharply round. \"You are?!\" She nodded and he laughed again and hugged her. They flew over the oddly shaped buildings and numerous sphinxes, at that Valentine did all but growl. They eventually landed near the dark woods, \"You want to do this?\" He asked, \"I could say the same.\" Then they walked out, and surrounded by solders. \"Well, that could off gone better.\" Helena said. They turned to leave when they were confronted with the queen and her daughter, \"well, Helena, Valentine. Why leave so soon. Why not say a while, tell us why the white realm is so strong.\" \"Yeah, sure!\" Helena said. The outburst sudden, but she was running on desperation. \"Fine, be stubborn, I will get it out of you eventually. GUARDS!\" They grabbed them by the arms and tried to tug them away to the dungeons. Helena felt the wave of dizziness fall over her again as she dropped like a stone, the guard's arms holding her off the floor. \"Helena!\" She heard vaguely before she passed out. She felt the shackles tugging painfully around her fragile wrists; she got her feet under her. The cell was damp and dirty, the ceiling dripping green water, she heard a shuffle. Helena looked up, opposite her was Valentine. Chained like she was, blood dripped from behind his mask. \"Valentine! Wake up!\" She whispered as loud and desperately as she could, it was obvious Valentine had fought to get to her. He moved and then his head snapped up and looked around the room. \"Helena! Are you alright, they didn't hurt you?\" He whispered frantically. \"No, no I'm okay. I don't know what happening; I passed out for no reason.\" Helena said with annoyance at herself, Valentine was hurt because of her. \"You said earlier you felt better.\" He said. \"I did, I really don't know, this has never happened before,\" she tugged at the metal bands around her wrists. \"Hang on, we'll get out of here,\" she whispered as she continued to pull at the bands, the blood and sweat from her hands helping her slip them off. Soon she had one hand done and was sliding off the other shackle, Valentine watching her work. She had told him not to try, she'd get his off. Helena stood in front of valentine searching her pockets, she then pulled put a key for her house, and this was her world, so why couldn't this key fit the locks. She leant over to the cuffs and poked the key in, hoping it would work. Surely enough the locks clicked; Leaving Valentine's hands free. \"How'd you do that?\" He asked but she knew he didn't expect an answer right now. She opened the cell door quietly and they sneaked out onto the courtyard. The Queen was stood on the steps and soon they were once again surrounded. \"Helena, here I was thinking you were a good girl. How'd you escape then?\" The queen said smugly, her evil little daughter almost radiating hate. \"With brains you don't possess my dear.\" Valentine sounded; he slipped his arm around Helena's shoulder for protection. The queen gestured to the guards; Valentine and Helena struggled and fought to get back together. The queen shouting and Valentine being dragged away made her feel strange, it was similar to the times before but instead of fainting she just got angry. Unbearably angry, the commotion of the small wittering little guards and the annoying shriek of the queen and the pure need to get back to Valentine was becoming overwhelming and her head threatened to burst. Then she remembered the queen of light, she told her to look inside, everything was there, she created this world. It was hers. Valentine was fighting for all he was worth, there was just too many, it was becoming impossible with the queens rage pressing down on them. He looked over to Helena; she looked strange, calm almost. Her eyes shut; she no longer regarded the queen, which made the queen angry. The shouting at Helena was getting louder and more hateful, the queen storming toward Helena with hatred in each stomp of her boot. The storm clouds were getting thicker and the wind picking up as the rain started, becoming heavier and more violent. Then Helena opened her eyes, the queen a few feet away gasped alongside everyone else. This was why the queen of light regarded her so highly, Helena's eyes glowed a sunlight gold. The brightness was blinding, Helena like an angel but not one of peace. An angel of rage, the elements threw themselves fast and hard towards the queen, she blocked it with her blackness but was struggling. The trees roots tangling themselves with the guard's legs, pulling them into the thick, black mud. Lightning flashed down leaving scorches on the ground. This was what had been trying to unlock itself from Helena. She was the creator; with only good in her mind. What was happening in her world angered her. Valentine stared in awe; the strength of Helena's mind was striking. The queen becoming desperate, she frantically put up shields Helena tore down with force. \"I'm not going to kill you.\" Helena stated, all that was in her voice was pity, \"I need you to balance the world I have made, but I am going to take your powers of darkness. I will leave you with your castle and your daughter but nothing else; no one can be controlled by you any longer.\" Helena's eyes faded back to their chocolate brown as she looked up to Valentine. Helena looked up to him, hoping for some sign he was okay, that he was alive in his Valentine shaped shell. He smiled and walked up to her and whispered in her ear, \"Looks like you're an important woman, where's your tower?\" Helena laughed at the ridiculousness of it. Valentine nodded in the direction of the castle, \"shall we?\" he said in a stupid voice. \"We shall\" Helena replied, they got there soon enough and were leaving through the sky in a flash. Valentine shuffled and Helena looked up. She looked at his face, his now cracked mask and nervous expression. \"Valentine?\" she enquired, \"Yeah?\" he replied almost immediately. \"Have you ever considered taking off your mask?\" she asked hesitantly \"What?! Why on earth would I do that?\" Helena rushed to fix things. \"I'm…I…um not…not now I just mean, I. just… have you thought about it. Ever?\" she stuttered. \"No, not really. Why? Do you want me to?\" He asked gingerly, \"no, no, not if you don't want to. I just wondered.\" He seemed to roll that in his mind for a moment, \"I will, If you want.\" He said a sort of fascination in his voice but also nervousness. Helena nodded, her eyes focused on his cracked mask. He fumbled with the clay edges before slowly, cautiously pulling it down and off. The orange-y paint covered his lower face but his skin was pale and soft. His hair darker than the man at the circus, it was a mousy brown. His eyes were rich blue, like sapphires, Valentine had high cheekbones and was over all very handsome. Valentine waited for some sort of reaction as he pulled the clay off his chin and wiped the last of the paint off onto his white jacket. Helena's eyes were glazed, before she blinked and looked at him with what he could only describe as want. Helena lent forward and Valentine did the same. Their lips brushed lightly which sent sparks down both of them. The kiss became slightly harder and when Valentine ran his tongue along her lower lip Helena shivered. Her hands found the nape of his neck and she pulled at the smaller hairs. Valentine found his hands at her hips as he trailed light circles. When the need of air became too much they rested their foreheads together looking into each other's eyes as they smiles. When the Tower landed in the light realm the got out and lay on the small hill of grass. In the middle of an empty street. The fish swam through the air as they lay next to each other. \"So, I've got nowhere to sleep tonight.\" Helena gestured, \"Well you are the creator you al… oh! You mean, stay at my tower. With me .\" Helena flushed alongside Valentine. \"V…VALENTINE! You dolt! Not like t…that!\" Helena flushed more, her face bright red. Valentine just smiled awkwardly, \" sureeeeee! \" He suggested, \"Valentine! Behave!\" He laughed. When the sun went down he showed me round the tower, \"this is your room.\" He opened the door to a large and luxurious room with and four poster bed made-up with pale blue sheets. Helena nodded, \"I don't want to go to bed quite yet, what do you do for entertainment?\" Valentine showed her to a large living room, the peach carpet covered the floor and against each wall a red fabric couch and a single coffee table. In the corner a television was placed and above that a DVD player. \"Ohhh Valentine I didn't know you were so modern.\" She winked at him; he picked her up and chucked her on the couch, \"you just thought of it, it wasn't like this before!\" She smiled, \"the trampoline is in the next room if you're worried.\" She said cheekily. \"So, what you think of this room for?\" he asked looking around, \"It's basically empty!\" he said surprised. \"Well, lay the blankets and pillows on the floor like a giant bed and I'll mess with the metal box in the corner\" she said sarcastically. He just threw a pillow at her and set up the blankets. When they had finished they lay down under the blankets, snuggled together and watched a movie. Helena thought before she fell asleep on Valentine's chest, that she could ask him the next day what the film was about. She would guess he had no idea, to concentrated on asking silly questions or tickling her or kissing her to actually watch. Thanks for reading! Please R&R; or comment on what you think.

It was silly of her to think of that when she first met him. Yes, he had the same voice, the same height, and the same mannerisms. And, yes, he looked eerily familiar in the mask that she had made for him, but no. He was definitely not Valentine. For one thing, he was a horrible juggler. She couldn't comprehend how someone who generally had excellent reflexes, as evidenced by how easily and quickly he could catch random things thrown at him without any warning, was so helpless when it came to learning how to move an object from one hand to another for longer than two minutes. She had spent hours teaching him, drilling the lessons she had learned from her dad over and over again into this thick head, but nothing ever seemed to stick. Finally, she gave up on the lessons and her dad then took him aside and suggested that perhaps he may be more comfortable working as one of the clowns. He had frowned at those words, but he had also nodded and accepted them. And so he had put white makeup on his thin face and learned how to do the tricks and pratfalls expected of him. And though he wasn't exactly the most skillful of the bunch, he became proficient enough at what he had to do that her dad had let him stay on and keep his job. But, often, she would catch him rehearsing, struggling with the pins and balls he vainly attempted to juggle whenever he had a spare moment. She always felt odd at such times. She wanted to go to him and try to teach him again, yet she also wanted to avoid him and pretend that it was perfectly all right that he didn't know how to juggle. Because he wasn't Valentine. She had to keep reminding herself of that. He was absolutely not Valentine. His name was Jason and he told unfunny jokes about movies that only he had seen, and he never acted like he was an important man or an important anything because he was always nice and polite to everyone, but he was a little too comfortable chatting with girls who came to see the circus, and he never acted goofy or clueless around them, yet he never accepted their invitations for a dinner or a coffee, and he read every chance he got, books that were a little too serious for her taste since they were about subjects like outer space and biology because he used to study some kind of science before he left university, and he was always nice and sweet to her though he never pushed past the boundaries of the casual friendship he had firmly established between them once he learned her age, and he was a little too weird and fussy, but he never treated her like a child, and she was always vaguely confused about how she was supposed to treat him because he was not the person she thought he would be, and why couldn't he just be Valentine? Her head wouldn't be in such a muddle if he could only be Valentine. She took out the Mirrormask from its hiding place inside her dresser one night and she looked at her face reflected on its silvery surface for a long time before she finally put it on. When she started dreaming, she wandered around the city for a while, asking strangers about the boy with the spiky hair who could juggle, and she received several conflicting directions before she finally found him entertaining a small crowd at the bridge where they had once talked about names and how important it was to have a properly romantic one. Ever the showman, he finished off his act with a dazzling display of skill before he extinguished the flaming balls, took a deep bow to appreciative applause, and then finally acknowledged her presence. \"Hello there,\" he said, and though his mask covered his expression, Helena knew that he was beaming. \"Finally thought to pay a visit to old friends? Where are the rabbits?\" She rolled her eyes. \"I didn't think to bring them this time. So, how are you?\" \"Oh, excellent as always.\" He hoisted himself up onto the stone railing of the bridge, sat down, and patted the empty spot beside him. She followed his example and, for several minutes, they merely sat together in silence. \"So, what brings you back?\" he wondered. \"Some Dark Princess has stolen your place in your world again? Can't be the same one as before. I heard that her mum has got her locked up in a Tower of her own. Poor thing can't move without a guard shadowing her. She's gone quite mad, according to stories.\" He sounded like he couldn't care less about the Other Helena's terrible fate. And that was the difference between Valentine and the man who should be Valentine back in the real world. Jason wouldn't talk so casually about something that was actually tragic. Not that Valentine was cruel or hardhearted. It was just that he was a boy, the first boy that she had felt something other than pure friendship for, who was a bit thoughtless and selfish, yes, due to his immaturity, though she knew that he had a good heart somewhere and he could even be counted on to use it from time to time. But, still, he was not Jason. Impulsively, Helena leaned towards Valentine and gave him a brief kiss on the cheek of his mask. He started and almost fell off the railing and into the golden river below, but he righted himself quickly. \"What was that for?\" he demanded in a huff. She smiled. \"Oh, nothing,\" she shrugged. \"You're quite adorable in your own way, you know. I'm glad I got to meet you.\" \"Well, please don't be so glad about it if it means you're going to kiss me and put your hands upon my person whenever you feel like it!\" He scooted away from her. \"You're acting very strange. Are you really Helena?\" He peered at her intently. She cuffed him on the shoulder. \"Of course I am! Now let's go have an adventure and get chased by some sphinxes.\" After a few minutes of teasing, he finally joined her and they did have an adventure, one that made her smile when she woke up the next morning though she could not remember all the details of it clearly. Then she got up, brushed her teeth, took a shower, and put on the nicest clothes she owned that were not dresses. When she went out of her room and went into the kitchen, she saw that her mum and dad were having breakfast with Jason. \"Hello there,\" he greeted her with a smile. \"I was in the neighbourhood.\" She sat across from him and accepted the cup of tea he offered. \"I'm glad you're here. Could we go for a walk afterwards?\" Her parents watched the two of them keenly. Her father had a small frown on his face, but her mother had a knowing smile that she hid by taking a sip of her drink. He took some time to answer her. But, finally, he said, \"Yes. I'd like that.\" ","Summary":" Comparisons Of course, he wasn't Valentine.

Please don't sue-I don't own much. ~/~/~ \" I'm a very important man.\" -Valentine \"You'd have made a terrible waiter.\" The words were out of her mouth before she could hold them back, but still the young girl didn't regret speaking them out loud. They were impulsive, true, but they felt right. And as the man accidentally wrapped around her laughed in agreement, Helena found hilarity burbling up her throat to her lips and along into a spontaneous half-hidden smile. And something about it all drew him to her; she could tell. As he stopped laughing at her comment and continued simply for a the sake of sharing in her humor. But their connection couldn't last forever, and she watched as her words turned behind his eyes like clockwork. Resulting in a single confused expression. \"What?\" \"Never mind. I…long story. I'm Helena,\" Helena responded quietly, eyes still smiling in their upturned corners as she looked up into his taller view. And the young man she'd 'never seen before,' found he couldn't really look away. Even with the interference of color and sound, murmuring voices surrounding them both in cheery waves, he couldn't seem to draw himself away. \"Robby Vance. But my friends call me Va-.\" \"Valentine,\" she finished for him in a quick murmur, nodding. His mouth opened like a fish before it was replaced with an impressed smirk. It didn't last long, however, as he realized where his hand was on her back and the fact that they were both still in the direct line of site of the ticket booth. Immediately his long fingers were off the smooth of her back like it was a hot stove, form falling several feet back. And in the sudden transition he tossed her the ball as though it were a completely natural thing to do. And then she caught it. Brows furrowed, the newly introduced Valentine opened his mouth again to speak, but was interrupted as someone called her name. Helena tossed him a quick nod and dashed off. Leaving several of her juggling balls behind in the wet grass below for the man to hesitantly pick up. ~/~/~ Examining the interior of the circus tent, Vance mused on the irony of fate that had brought him where he was. A life of desperate 'unwantedness,' followed by a short stint of independence. All leading back where he started, so many years ago. It was a distant memory within the juggler's mind, revolving around the concept of light and shadow dwelling simultaneously within the same area. He remembered…weathered stone. A tower high above the clouds. And a mix of fiendish creatures, not all evil although predominantly fierce in appearance. He remembered…glass. A twist and twirl of dancing figures pulling him with them. He'd been…eight when he'd first returned. First returned. Where had that come from? Frowning, Robby pursed his lips into straight queue of thought, long legs drawn up within the tiny space the theater seating afforded him. Propping on bony elbow up on another bony knee so that he could rest his chin in the palm of his long hand. The imagery could only mean one thing: he was a creation of fantasy, a child of either the circus or gypsies. No other situation as fully explained his blurred past. And then it had all changed; a tall, feathery figure handing him off to the dour woman who demanded he call her 'mother'. That was where the memories became clear for him-with the tinkle of glass and silver as she handed over something in payment for him. It had always seemed like simple coinage to Valentine, but his subconscious whispered otherwise. The same subconscious which brought him hazy scenes of music and masks. And truthfully it had always felt like what she had given him was her dreams . But that couldn't be right, could it? Any more than the costumes he recalled could be true beasts or living fairytales. But lately he wasn't so sure. Not with the recent dream that had called him here by name. Not with meeting her as she was now. But she was too young; far younger than he'd had an impression of through their foggy dream-conversations. Ugh! It was all so jumbled in his head. Like pieces of a stained glass shattered and tossed, uncaring, on the ground. Combing both hands through his hair, Valentine allowed himself to indulge in the nervous habit until the untidy strands were even untidier in disorderly little spikes. But when he finally withdrew the two offending limbs he had to fight the desire to jump back in surprise as he found himself not alone. An older fellow sat in a similar pose, bent at the waist with forearms resting on his knees and hands occupied. Although the younger of the two had to do a yet another double-take as realized what with. Crystals. Dozens of crystals caught within the weaving net of gloved fingers, absently but expertly twirled to some inner rhythm. And come to think of it, the man really was humming something. But not loudly enough for Robby to tell what from. And come to think of it, wasn't he an odd looking man, too? Dressed all in dark jeans and what had to be black cowboy boots and a leather jacket. And the thin braid his unmanageable hair had been drawn up into held as much blonde as it did silver, leading to the belief that perhaps he was far older than he appeared. Odder, too, as winged eyebrows and mismatched eyes met Vance's blue ones over a hawkish nose. But the smirk he somehow knew resided just below never appeared. \"Strange, isn't it,\" the regally British voice asked, contrasting Vance's crisp Irishness in a single go. And the youth found himself wanting to be wigged out, annoyed, anything really. But all he could feel was slight trepidation tempered with…trust? Trust, really? For an unknown bloke in a circus tent? For all he knew the man could be one of the performers themselves, pulling a stunt. But unconsciously the rolling vocal tones relaxed him and Robby immediately found himself nodding. \"…very strange,\" the fellow continued quietly, absentmindedly, \"to be reunited. With old faces and old places. Wouldn't you say so?\" Brows bunching at the eery similarity of his words to Valentine's thoughts, Robby turned the frown forming on his face into something resembling an affirmative grin. But not enough, apparently, as his unwilling companion's bittersweet quiet transitioned into a lightly humorous half-smile. Immediately the younger of the two dropped the expression like a bad juggler, shoulders dipping inward as he heaved a heavy sigh. \"Right. Old faces.\" \"You don't remember me, do you?\" That got his attention. Turning fast enough to get whiplash the strawberry blonde was facing his older contemporary in an instant, but the gentleman had already looked away. Gazing at some vague point in the ring as the lights dimmed ever so slightly. Fifteen minutes before curtain, Robby's mind supplied, but the rest of him was primed for an answer. Any answer, really. But apparently his curious visitor wasn't willing to share, pulling air into his lungs like it was his right as he slowly straightened. Then smirked tiredly, motioning towards the center stage with an elegant twirl of hand that made Valentine realize for the first time that his crystals had magically disappeared. But to no pockets that he could see, those decidedly black jeans worn as tightly as they'd seemed from the beginning. \"She's a rare one, wouldn't you say? A Dreamer . They tend to create worlds till they bleed…or go mad. You might actually be familiar with the sensation yourself, if I'm correct,\" an ironic little smirk and a nod were the only concession for the 'boy's ability before he continued, \"Still, like a rose's short blooming, it's something to cherish. Don't you agree?\" He had to be barking mad. Or maybe he was on something. Because Vance hadn't an inkling as to what the gent talking about. Unless he meant… Dodging a glance at the curtains beyond the open arena, Robby's eyes, 'blue as Forget-Me-Nots,' fell on a slim figure in metallic spandex, ballet shoes modified for circus use. She seemed to be searching for something and the young man wondered what until her hazel orbs landed on him, dark lashes brushing along milky white cheeks. And then her gazing ended and his breath went with it, something warm and solid growing in the gap between his rib cage. There was no doubt about it. She was the one. Sixteen years old and off limits to him at his own nineteen lovely annuals. But she knew him; knew and had been searching, the way he had searched all his life. Although maybe what he had been searching for and what he had actually found was entirely different than the answers he'd been seeking? And maybe this end result was better than it would have been, anyway? But she was still too young. In this world anyway. Where had that thought come from? And then even odder words come out from the cruel twist of a mouth standing high above him. Answering words and thoughts left unspoken, \"not so young, I think. It's only forever; not long at all. You can wait a few years before she grows I'm sure. I have. But no longer-now is the time to act.\" What was that supposed to mean? But he wasn't given the chance to press for an answer as the man whirled around like one wearing a cape. Forced to watch as the old juggler held up a single specimen of glass Vance could tell he was about to throw, the young man called out the only question he could think of as he rushed back to the tent entrance. Dodging patrons and children left and right as the need for real honesty nearly choked the Irish man. \"Wait! Who are you?\" \"You can call me… Gareth . Gareth Peverell. I suppose I'll be seeing you again soon, Tobias.\" And then he had dropped the delicate orb, exiting the tent in the wake of billowing white dust clouds and cream-colored feathers. But even those disintegrated amid the rush of a light wind and eager crowds, till nothing was left of the strange man's existence. Reluctantly, so very reluctantly, Robby Vance turned away to retake his place among the sitting viewers. Hands combing yet again through short locks, as though questioning his own sight until reality had once again settled into its proper realm. It wasn't until at the end of the first act, on the edge of his seat in wait for that interesting girl from before to appear, that Robby thought to correct the disappearing man. After all, his name wasn't Tobias. Or was it? ~/~/~ AN: If you can't guess who the \"older gentleman\" is, I really can't help you. ^^; Except perhaps to say that you should take a look at some of the other works of Jim Henson. This honestly started as an innocent little exploration of 'Robby's character and the possibility that he, as Valentine, came to the same world Helena did as a visitor. And maybe that he's been dreaming about her the way she's been dreaming about him. But somehow things developed into…something more. I was just thinking about different ways they could interact and the quote from the movie, \"she wasn't even my real mother. She bought me from a man,\" (loosely paraphrased) came to mind, reminding me of a certain child thief. And then it evolved into a weirdly convoluted, yet not entirely improbable plot. ^^; Hoo boy, I'm just a tad pathetic. But! And this is a strong 'but'…Helena in another world is a Princess. What's not to say Valentine isn't something similar? Perhaps an heir? After all, didn't he say he was a, \"very important man?\" Gareth -gentle (name of one of Arthur's knights), Peverell -piper. Seemed like a fitting name. Mirrormask, Labyrinth, Peter Pan, and Tin Man don't belong to me. So sad.

It was almost two years ago that I first saw them perform. I had just lost my job, I worked for a magazine company that published a bunch of avant-garde stuff and it just ran itself into the ground, so I decided to take a stroll about town. There was a bit of a crowd gathering down by an old empty field, so I had thought to take a look and see what the fuss was about. When I got closer I saw a huge colorful tent and random people in masks running about and keeping everyone in line entertained while they waited. I knew I should've been saving my money, but I was sad and I really just needed it. So I joined the line and silently purchased a ticket, from an older woman, at the booth outside the tent. Then I made my way inside and got a decent seat towards the front. I really enjoyed it all, the laughter, music, and cheers from the crowd were all familiar and welcoming. (I would sometimes perform tricks and play a mime on weekends for tips to help ends meet) But it wasn't until she came out that I really focused on any of the performances. \"Now from darkest Peru Raymondo and Fortuna!\" the Ringmaster called from a mic behind a curtain somewhere. Out rushed a man in billowing robes with a mask that looked like crushed tinfoil, and then came a young girl in tights with a full black and white mask. They juggled random objects that assistants brought out, doubling their speed with each new item. She was so quick and slender and…well…beautiful. Now before you go screaming pedophile and such, I might remind you I was seventeen at the time and only three years older than her, she turned fourteen later that year. They ended the act by juggling some bananas and being chased by someone in a monkey suit. I expected her to reappear in one of the next acts, but she didn't show up again. After the show ended I went back to the ticket booth and loitered. After about thirty minutes the ringmaster passed by and asked me if I needed anything. I honestly didn't know what to say at first and I stumbled over my words introducing myself, and clumsily shook his hand. What was I to say, \"Hello, I've been standing about here for half an hour on the off chance I might meet the young lady you juggled with and tell her I think she's beautiful!\" ? Instead I somehow ended up telling him about my weekend acts and how I'd just lost my job. Mr. Campbell was very kind from the start he asked if I'd like to join them and auditioned me on the spot. I passed and joined the rest of the performers. A few days after that I finally spoke to Helena, actually she spoke to me. I was practicing my contact juggling, making four glass spheres dance about my palm, I became so absorbed in it I didn't notice Helena sneak up behind me and watch until she let out a whistle of approval. I ended up dropping them all and having to scramble after them. It made her laugh, and that made me happy. We got introductions out of the way and we just started talking. We would talk for hours about everything and nothing. I told her about school and the magazine I had worked for, the town I grew up in, etc. and she told me funny stories about the crew, of her drawings, and about how she wanted to move in with her aunt. Helena hated and loved the circus, she would never admit it to herself she loved it no matter how obvious it was, but she would always talk down on it. I understood that she wanted security and all, but I couldn't begin to understand how she could speak so badly about the place. A year went by and I grew close to her and her family. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were both fond of me from that start and took me under their wings. Helena and I became best friends, we were the youngest in the circus and that set us apart from the others a bit. We would just talk, practice, joke, and eat lunches and stuff. It's not like we had many adventures, except that one involving the mob and the cow, but that's another story. I always wanted to tell her how I felt but I wanted to wait until she was at least sixteen so it would be legal and all. Then everything went wrong. One night she and her mom had gotten into a particularly bad row, I had been joking with Mrs. Campbell about how Helena just needed some stern discipline and then she just…collapsed. We hurried and got her onto a cot and called an ambulance. She was put in the hospital, which but a strain on their finances, and Helena went to stay with her Nan, who's town we were luckily stopped in. I couldn't see her at all for weeks. I wanted to do something, anything, tell her it would be okay and hold her and tell her how much I loved her, but I couldn't. I just couldn't drop something like that on her while her mom might be dying. Then Mrs. Campbell had her surgery and got better, things were beginning to look better. We were back on the road and Helena was finally on good terms with her parents. We were all perfectly content and this was the best time for me to confess to her! Then he showed up…Valen McKinnon. He just shows up asking for a job and \"bumps\" into her and suddenly they're all close and cuddly and just together! He can barely even juggle! He's older than me for Christ's sake! Isn't that a bit more pedoish! But I am her best friend nothing more to her, I'm supposed to support her and all. …How does a mime say, \"I love you.\"?

Some are satin, some are steel, some are silk and some are leather, They're the faces of a stranger but we love to try them on. - From 'The Stranger' by Billy Joel Helena didn't think she'd ever been so aware of her heart beating as she was now, looking into the face of the young man who was not quite a stranger. His confused \"What?\" hung in the air between them. Really, though, she'd known from when he'd laughed at her \"You'd have been a lousy waiter\" crack that he wasn't Valentine. She could just imagine Valentine's response: he'd pout his painted lips and glare at her through the tiny eye-holes in his mask, and then in that Irish lilt (why was someone in her imagination Irish, anyway?) he'd protest petulantly, \"I would not make a lousy waiter; I would make a fabulous waiter. I just don't want to .\" But that hadn't happened. That hadn't happened because he wasn't Valentine. Hell, he'd even apologised to her straight out after bumping into her. Still, Helena hoped he'd laughed because he thought she was cute – not cute in a child way, but cute in a... in a... oh, God, why was she so bad at this? She wanted him to like her, basically. He was good-looking (definitely better looking than the horrible boy fake-Helena had been kissing in her dream) and... and... and he reminded her of Valentine . She knew that Valentine only existed in her dream. She'd given up any childish belief that the world she'd created was some alternate reality when she'd awoken to find that only a few hours had passed, not the entire day she'd seen through the windows, and that all the stuff fake-Helena had seemed to do hadn't been done. This meant, quite simply, that the whole thing had just been a dream conjured up by a mind consumed by worry for Joanne Campbell. And it just so happened that in that dream she'd met a cowardly, traitorous, jewel-loving, cake-hogging juggler and tumbled (in a way that would have won the applause of the Campbell Family Circus' illustrious German tumblers themselves) head-over-heels in love with him. She'd spent most of the fortnight since that dream (and she'd never had another one about it) thinking about him. Stupid bloody unrequited love. \"What's your name?\" the not-quite-stranger asked, jolting her from her reverie. Helena supposed he must have given up hope of ever getting an answer to his question of what she'd meant about waiters. \"Helena.\" Although he'd let go of her earlier he was still standing very, very close to her. Her eyes were still fixed on his face. The very fact that he had a face made him seem like a stranger. And he is a stranger, she reminded herself. You have never met him before. \"Mine's Jason,\" said Jason, quickly adding, \"but I'm thinking about changing it. You know, going for something more circus-y. \" \"Yeah,\" Helena said, grinning at him a little wickedly. \"You want something with a bit of dignity and style, mixed with a bit of romance.\" \"Exactly!\" he enthused. Then, with a dramatic hand gesture that was so absolutely, inescapably, heartbreakingly him , he said: \"Like Valentine. \" Helena's heart, which she was so painfully aware of, skipped a beat. How, how, how could he be a stranger when he was so familiar? Jason woke up with a feeling that he'd grown used to: his face wasn't right. He frequently woke up from dreams like this, where some kind of freaky mask was involved. He could only remember snippets, but he'd been dreaming like this for years now. The dreams were an integral part of his life, really, mostly because he tended to turn to dreamland as a solution to his problems. Jason knew he was pretty depressed. Things hadn't been going so well for him in 'real life', so dreams seemed like a nice alternative. His mother had kicked him out gleefully as soon as he was accepted at university. He'd had to stay in a disgusting (and disgustingly over-priced) hotel until term had started. Then he'd made the fatal mistake of thinking things were going his way, because his name had been drawn out of a hat, making him the head first-year, in charge of looking after their accommodation, or 'the Tower' as it was affectionately known. Of course, he'd just ended up arguing with every other student there until eventually the whole Tower was against him. And Jason was terrible at apologising. In short, Jason was miserable. This time, though, his dream had inspired a solution: a circus. Among the few things Jason remembered clearly about his dreams were that he called himself Valentine in them (he did not know why), he wore a weird striped mask, and he was a professional juggler. Jason really could juggle, actually. He could juggle well. Sure, he'd mostly only learned because it drove his mother round the bend when he juggled the groceries, but that wasn't important. So why not give in and just do as he'd always wanted: why not run away and join the circus? It was nearly the summer holidays anyway, so he'd be dropping out right at the end of the year. It was decided. As he pulled clothes carelessly out so he could get dressed, he remembered, sort of fondly, that in his most recent dream there'd been a girl . A pretty girl. She'd been brave and funny, too, if he recalled. And she'd had bunny slippers. Yep, bunny slippers. Maybe Jason was funny in the head. Meeting girl by bumping into her? Cliché much, Jason? And then,when he really saw her, he had to catch himself before he told her that he'd seen her in a dream. She was smiling at him in total delight. It was definitely her, the dream girl. Do not mention dreams, Jason, this is not a bloody Disney movie. He did apologise to her, though. It felt like doing nothing at all. Somehow, without really knowing this stranger at all, he felt that she deserved an apology from him. Funny, that, because he hardly ever apologised, especially not for something as trivial as bumping into someone. He told her, with his best 'charming smile' firmly in place, that he wanted to join the circus. It had taken him two weeks to find this place and, now he'd seen her here, he was positive that this was the circus for him. She made some joke about waiters. Laugh, laugh, you idiot! And laugh he did. He laughed for quite a while before he realised he had no idea what she was talking about. \"What?\" he asked, but then, as her deep brown eyes looked up at him in a slightly pained way (what had he said?), a little voice piped up at the back of his mind: \"Wasn't there something about being a waiter in that dream? Something to do with fruit?\" Oh, good God, I am cracking up. Quick, say something else before she realises you're a nutcase who thinks he's been dreaming about her! He asked her what her name was. She said it was Helena. And that sounded familiar, which it shouldn't have done because she was a stranger. He did not know her at all. Maybe, said the voice in his head, which seemed to have an opinion about everything, this is what it's like to properly have feelings for a girl – especially a girl who might just actually like you. It's not like you'd really know what that's like. It was worth considering that, at nineteen, Jason had not ever had a proper girlfriend. Girls tended either to reject him immediately or give him a try for a week or so, then realise he was a total loser who loved the sound of his own voice, was incredibly greedy and an out-and-out coward who regularly made a fool of himself and who liked juggling of all things, and then they'd ditch him quicker than you could say 'concertina'. So maybe, just maybe, it was a natural thing (that Jason just happened not to have any prior experience of) to feel this way about a pretty stranger. But then he mentioned the name 'Valentine' and he could see something snap inside her. He wasn't great with emotions, but he thought he saw both pain and hope splash across her features simultaneously. She had such a... mobile face. It was gorgeous. \"So what is it you want to do in the circus, Valentine?\" she asked him suddenly. \"I'm a juggler,\" he replied without missing a beat. She muttered something very softly which sounded to him, although he wasn't sure, like: \"Of course you are.\" She raised her voice and said, \"Look, Valentine, I really need to get back to amusing these poor punters in the ticket queue, but I'd like to... I'd like to see you juggle before your audition, if that's OK. Meet me behind the big top after the show?\" Goal! \"I'll be waiting,\" he told her in the sexiest tone he could manage. He placed the juggling ball he was still holding in her hand. Oh yes, this one he'd get to like him. Helena and Valentine. Oh... how weird... he'd just thought of himself as Valentine. It transpired that Valentine – Jason, he's Jason, Helena reminded herself harshly – was not waiting. Helena was left standing behind the big top, awkwardly shuffling her feet, until he eventually emerged, carrying an enormous bag of doughnuts. His lips were coated in sugar, which he licked off sheepishly when he saw the expression on her face. Helena was furious, not just because he'd made her wait, but because these flashes of how very much like her Valentine he was were starting to become some kind of torture, \"I didn't mean to take so long...\" he told her. She was just about to sigh and tell him that she understood that after seeing the food he couldn't help himself, but suddenly he said those words again: \"I'm sorry.\" This time the apology cut her like a knife. Oh, God, Valentine... He did not miss the flash of hurt that passed across her face. What could he do? He wasn't equipped to deal with this sort of thing, so he did the only thing he could think of: he put the bag of doughnuts down and scooped up in their place the juggling balls she'd placed on the ground for them. He tossed them into the air. Helena could have cried, and she was not a girl who really approved of crying. She'd cried about her mum's brain tumour, obviously. She'd cried in the dream when he'd handed her over to the Dark Queen. Both times she'd cried because it had seemed like her whole world was falling apart. That's what it felt like now. In his juggling she saw all her adventures with Valentine, all her feelings about the stupid, arrogant git, and all the things she'd never said. All at once, this stranger threw a ball at her. She took it easily and joined in with his juggling. Without any verbal agreement they both set up an enchanting pattern of flying balls, just as they had when Valentine had broken the spell of the Dark Queen. They juggled in silence for some time, covertly studying each other. Jason couldn't get away from the fact that she was still a girl, several years his junior, but that didn't do anything to ease the dryness of his throat as he watched her juggle. Helena broke the silence. \"Valentine, if I tell you something weird, will you think I'm crazy?\" \"Yes, I expect so.\" She swallowed, too nervous of what she was going to say to respond to this. \"Valentine ...I... I had a dream once... and... well... you were kind of... in it.\" Jason, or Valentine, or whoever he thought he was, dropped the ball he'd just caught. \"Butterfingers,\" Helena said weakly. Jason had bent to retrieve the ball, and he stayed down for a long moment, looking at the ground. Helena could not see his face. He rose. Painted across his features was a look of mingled apprehension and resolve. This was a gamble, but the prize, if he won, would be worth it. \"Why shouldn't you dream about me?\" he said softly, almost – but not quite – tentatively. \"I am, after all, a Very Important Man.\" The air was knocked out of him as Helena collided with him, her arms locking around his neck ad her tear-stained face burrowing into his shirt. \"You are Valentine! I thought... I thought you were some kind of stranger...\" \"I had a dream about you, too,\" he said, stroking her back and casually allowing the smell of her hair to wash over him. \"That's great,\" she whispered into his shoulder, and he could tell she was holding back sobs. \"So... same dreams... that's...\" he faltered. She looked up at him, with her big brown eyes so full of joy and... and something more , and she said, quite calmly, \"You don't remember it all, do you?\" Valentine (for he was now sure, as was she, that he was Valentine) grinned sheepishly. \"Eh... not per se, no...\" \"It's OK,\" she said, smiling broadly. He'd seen her smile like that before. Not just when he'd bumped into her beside the queue, but before that. Her hair had been all styled up, she'd had a black dress, and she'd been grinning down at him from the top of some steps... \"It's OK, Valentine,\" she continued, taking his hands in her own petite ones. \"As long as I know you're you, I know how to get your memories back.\" He thought she was going to kiss him then, but she turned away from him. She was, at least, still holding his hand. \"Come on!\" she said over her shoulder, tugging on his hand. She could have laughed out loud in sheer delight when he paused to pick up his bag of doughnuts. She led him to her trailer. The knowledge of what to do was with her, just as it had been when she was dreaming. She opened the door and stepped inside, turning to invite Valentine in. He was wavering in front of the doorway, but he hadn't dropped her hand. \"How likely is it,\" he asked, \"that your parents will kill me if they find me in here?\" Helena shrugged. \"I'm just going to show you round, that isn't a crime. And besides,\" she added, \"I don't intend for them to find you.\" He followed her inside. The walls of Helena's trailer were pasted with drawings. He leant in closer to examine them. Sphinxes. Giants. Two queens. Then... him . It was him. All of this was familiar, so very familiar. A psychologist could have explained that Helena's drawings were acting as visual triggers, stimulating his subconscious memory to recall every last detail of his dreams. All he felt though, were the parts of his dreams – years of dreams more than Helena's one – that had slipped away upon his waking rising slowly, as though through dark water. And, would you look at that, he had hogged that cake. And... \"Please say something,\" Helena begged the young blond man who'd just sunk down onto her unmade bed. He turned to look at her tortuously slowly. \"I betrayed you,\" he moaned. She sat down beside him, but he flinched away. \"I gave you up to the Dark Queen for a hatful of rubies. I'd forgotten that. I probably didn't want to remember. How can you even look at me after I did that?\" Helena took his hand tenderly. \"But you came back. That's what matters. And now you've come back to me again.\" It was now or never. She drew in a deep breath and twisted round so she was kneeling beside him on the bed. She reached out her hand that wasn't in his and touched his cheek. Gently, she turned his head so he was facing her. Closing her eyes, she leant in and pressed her lips to his. He met her halfway. Her hands moved to his hair and his to round her waist. No, this wasn't one of the crazed, messy snogs people Valentine had known at university went on about, but there'd be time for those in a few years. This kiss in itself was magical enough for him now. And as for Helena, her first kiss was what few people outside of dreams would ever be able to claim it to be: perfect. At last they separated, and Helena rested her head blissfully against his shoulder. They breathed each other in. \"OK,\" she said, breaking the silence, \"now you've got to tell me how you ended up in the world I created.\" He leant back on the bed, resting slightly on one elbow, holding Helena to him. \"I don't know exactly, but – your mother, she was the Dark Queen?\" He snapped into the subject change suddenly in the way his quick mind was always able to do. Helena marvelled at him and squeezed him a little bit tighter. \"And the Queen of the Light. Most of the people I know turned up there. But you I didn't know. And no one else remembered anything. What's with that?\" Without releasing Helena from his embrace, Valentine stretched up and plucked down one of her marionettes. It was him. Helena blushed a bit, but he didn't mock her. Instead, he said, \"I think most of your characters were just based on your circus-folk, but when you made Valentine... ooh, well, there just wasn't anyone around brilliant enough to be him.\" She swatted his arm cheekily, and then kissed it. He grinned and dangled the marionette in front of her nose. \"Your world needed someone to fill a role,\" he went on. \"And, by some divine coincidence, across the Irish Sea was a sad boy who needed a role to fill. \"Do you remember me telling you about my mother? You didn't create my dream mother; I did. She's just like my real mother: uncaring, cruel; but in my dreams – do you remember? – she bought me from someone else . That's every miserable child's dream, isn't it, to find out that the parent or parents you loathe aren't really your parents? \"So you see, I was a very miserable boy. I needed a world to move into, a world where I could juggle without being slapped, where I could hide my face behind a mask, where I could get away from the reality I couldn't bear. In my dreams I had no memories outside of the ones I made in my dreams. Of course,\" he finished with a hint of wry amusement, \"I still had a mother who hated me, but your world did give me some escape.\" He wasn't looking at Helena, so the second kiss caught him totally unawares. He was pushed into the pillow, Helena's hands lovingly massaging his scalp. \"I'm so, so sorry you had to go through that,\" she said when they pulled apart breathlessly. \"Maybe what you said is right, maybe that is how it worked – it sounds like about the most sensible explanation that there can be for this crazy stuff. But to be honest, I don't care . I'm just glad that you were there, in my dream world. What matters is that we met, and that you're here now, with me.\" He smiled at her and she smiled at him. \"I know you'll get through the audition, Valentine,\" Helena assured him, lying down completely against his chest. He ran the fingers of one of his very talented hands through her short, soft hair. \"We were a great juggling duo, weren't we?\" he mused. \"The best.\" A pause. \"Helena,\" Valentine began a little awkwardly, starting to sit up. A shadow had passed across his face, and she could not quite read his expression, as though his mask were back on. \"I... I... I...\" Helena recognised this and smiled faintly. She wasn't sure what he wanted to apologise for, but it was funny to watch him struggle to get the words out. The words that came, though, were not what she expected. He looked her straight in the eye and told her, nervously but totally sincerely, \"Helena, I love you.\" Helena's breath caught. \"I love you too. I love you too, you cowardly, cake-hogging...\" Helena never got to finish her rant, Valentine having found a novel way of shutting her up: his lips crashed down onto hers and he drew her close. They poured themselves into the kiss, knowing full well they were not strangers. They were Helena and Valentine, just as they always should have been, and just as they always would be: together.

It had been three or four months since the White Queen had awoken, and she had promptly taken care of several big problems, the most prominent being the Dark Queen and her wretched daughter. Valentine wasn't sure if the Shadowlands even still existed, but he couldn't say he really cared. At the moment, the most important thing occupying his brain was learning this new trick: The High-Wire. It was difficult, death defying, and, if he didn't die while doing it, impressive beyond any of the other tricks he (Or anyone else in his world, for that matter) knew. From a bystander's point-of-view, you could say it was his way of avenging Bing, it could be to show his extraordinary balance (No doubt passed down through generations of Valentines), it could come in handy the next time he had to pass over a ravine on only a three inch thick rope. But really, if you knew him properly, you'd find out it was just to impress a lady. Helena had not returned since defeating her anti-form, but that certainly didn't cause him to lose hope. He knew she would be back sooner or later, and besides, she had saved the world. He had all the time in the world now to practice this trick. And it would impress her, and she would be jealous, and he would become something so much more in her eyes. With that thought fueling him, he took a deep breath and stepped off his tower, spreading his arms for balance. It was going fine so far, of course. He wasn't a very important man for nothing! This would be easy! Soon he would be doing all kinds of things: Juggling, cartwheeling, dancing... A few steps later, he fell and nearly broke his leg. Luckily his bones were made of steel. If they weren't, they were certainly stronger than everyone else's. A few more weeks passed. Valentine got further and further along the rope before he fell every time he tried, and was getting into the good habit of catching himself. He nearly forgot about Helena, but every time he looked up at that cord he remembered. He remembered why he was even doing this, why he was putting himself through this, why he was making a fool of himself. It was all for her. She'd love it. She'd love him. He worked harder, harder, growing distracted over time. He failed to catch himself on several occasions, spraining his wrists, skinning his knees, rolling his ankles, and on one occasion cracking his mask. It had to glue it back together and, while he was waiting for it to dry, tried to practice without it, which was both mortifying and bizarre, so he put it back on. He had no idea how Helena had gotten around without one. Speaking of her, where was she? She had not abandoned him, had she? No, of course not, that was out of the question! She hadn't forgotten about him, and she hadn't abandoned him, and she would come back soon, and he would take her mask-shopping! She would be back! She had to come back! He wished for her on those funny little dandelion fluffs, and on the stars, and on other kids' birthday cakes, but it didn't seem to help. Another month passed, and she remained absent, chose not to show her unmasked face. He grew hopeless, too much so to practice his trick. Heck, if she wasn't coming back, what was the point? So he remained isolated in his tower, brooding, feeling quite angry at the world, and often looked out his window at the sky, wondering if she was looking at him this very moment. He sometimes imagined that he could picture her face up in the stars, making out her eyes and her nose and her lips, likening himself to those great astronomers she had once talked about. Finally he tried again, desperate for something to take his mind off of her. He climbed up to the top of his tower and took a deep breath, poised and ready. He couldn't remember when he had last done this, but he was fairly sure he remembered. He was a Valentine, after all... He was wrong, it turned out. He didn't like to admit it, but he had to, as he plummeted hazardously towards the ground, landing on his feet but crumpling down to his stomach afterwards, breathing raggedly. And then he sighed, and to his humiliation he could feel his eyes burning behind his mask, his lashes the last remaining barricade against the tears waiting to fall. From somewhere in the distance he could hear somebody running towards him, and did his best to buck up. He was a man, and men didn't cry over stupid things like falling from a building and grievously injuring themselves! \"Valentine! Valentine, what in the world do you think you're doing?!\" He was being turned over, and then he felt something under his head. The first thing he saw was a bright light, and then a hazy figure. When it came into view a few minutes later, he saw that it was her. It was Helena. A surge of joy shocked through his veins, and he immediately stood up. She followed suit. \"Took you bloody well long enough, y'know!\" he said, a cross between relief, hysteria, and annoyance creeping into his voice. She screwed up her expression into one of apology. \"I'm sorry, Valentine, but I've been busy,\" she told him. \"The circus has been especially popular lately, and we've had to train tons of newbies... Anyway, what were you doing up there? You could have killed yourself!\" He didn't reply, taking a moment to just look at her. She hadn't changed since last time he saw her, but her hair did seem a little longer. She was wearing a sequin-covered leotard and black leggings, looking like she'd just come from a practice. He shook his head, returning to the present. \"I was practicing!\" he explained. \"And by the by, I've been worried sick about you! Leaving and not showing up for five months isn't exactly friendly!\" She laughed, which annoyed him slightly. He was on the verge of an emotional breakdown, and she was laughing at him? What had Helena turned into? But the next moment found him breathless, all other emotion drained from his being besides surprise. She took one step forward and grabbed him round the torso, pulling him into a tight embrace. \"I'd never abandon you, you know that,\" she said, nuzzling her cheek against his chest. \"I missed you.\" Without hesitating any longer (Because, really, who knew when he'd get to see her again?), he threw his arms around her shoulders and crushed her in a bear hug, burying his masked face into her warm neck. \"I missed you, too.\" \"By the way...\" she said, pushing away to look at him again, \"that's a very impressive trick. I just learned it for the circus back home!\" A/N: Just an updated version. :B I submitted on my DA in December of 2008, and I could have sworn I had already uploaded it here, but I guess I was mistaken, haha... -Skella ","Summary":" Valentine rubbed his hands triumphantly, admiring his handiwork. \"Well, Tower,\" he said, patting "},{"Movie":"MirrorMask","Title":"Parted","Author":"Rokuko Kaminari Blaze","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5575820","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hiya peoples I made this a long time ago. almost immediately after watching MirrorMask.

Fandom: MirrorMask/Labyrinth . I know, I know. I'm crazy. Rating: PG Characters/Pairing: Helena/Valentine/Alt!Valentine, Jareth Summary: And then there was the girl who was such a freak that the circus ran away to join her. Helena's back in her own world, having visions and mislaying her pencil. Part One \"Anyone seen my pencil?\" The request is made. It falls on deaf ears. There is hubbub and havoc backstage this early afternoon, and no one can quite spare the time to listen. Though Helena has her own chores to attend to, her continuing inability to find a pencil is downright bothersome. \"I want to draw,\" she says, to no one in particular, and no one in particular answers her. She frowns, dark eyebrows drawing down over dark eyes, and feels the tide of wanting surge up in her. There's something in the offing, waiting in the wings. Only it feels more like a someone. But she'll have to wait. \"Pencil?\" she tries again, looking about her at the circus family, crowding her on one side and passing her by, jumbling up against the wall in the brightest kaleidoscope, a broken fall of colors. No one says nothing. Very probably no one heard. Jason— sneaky devil, going around looking like someone he wasn't, she wouldn't put it past him to have appropriated all pencils in the vicinity as an awkward sort of joke— offers her a pen. She turns it down. \"Thanks, but no thanks. I'd rather be able to rub it out if I feel like it, not leave it indelibly for all to see.\" Rub what out, she doesn't say, and he doesn't ask. But she's polite, and his smile is hopeful and kind. \"You're sure? It's quite a good pen, I think. Very pointy on the pointy end, and not so much on the other, which I'm told is the fashion in pens these days.\" He has a go at balancing it on the tip of one finger. He's been taking lessons from Helena's father, but his natural clumsiness continues to get in the way. The pen wibbles, wobbles, topples, and he snatches at it with the other hand, misses, bats it away like it was an interfering insect, and stands crimsoned. Helena laughs. He takes encouragement. \"You haven't called me Valentine in nearly a month now,\" he says. \"I haven't needed to,\" says Helena. She does need something, though, whatever the something is. It takes shape in her head, a vague sort of shape but a shape nonetheless. It's the urge to draw, to create, countered now with a lingering fear that her creation will come to life and eat them all. She'll be careful not to draw something with too many teeth and talons, just on the off chance. She can't draw anything now, though, not without she finds a pencil first. She looks in her mother's desk in the caravan, all the drawers. She checks behind people's ears in case anyone's been note-making, and sticks her hand in people's pockets. She even asks a few members of the audience, promising to give it back by the end of the day. There are no pencils to be had. The urge does not abate. By evening, when she takes her curtain call beside her parents, the continued absence seems to turn sinister. Sleep comes uneasily, with the desire to draw still itching under her fingernails and in her ears, and though it disturbs her, it bothers her far more that the shapes might be gone when she wakes. But the morning comes, and the ideas are clearer, if anything. Jason, shoveling in the wake of the elephants, takes a break, steaming slightly, and comes to stand by her. She takes a half step away, but when he smiles on her genially she manages to respond. \"Find one yet?\" She shakes her head. \"Still looking.\" \"Rather sudden, this urge to draw something?\" He hints around for an explanation. He alone, out of the members of the circus, thinks this is unusual. He alone is too new to know that to Helena, pencil and paper is an absolute must. \"Comes on strong, does it?\" \"Moderately,\" she says, though this is in no way true. But he already thinks she's a bit weird— hints dropped, here and there, small lies and blatant truths, and the fact that she kept calling him Valentine when he first joined up, and also roars of unbridled laughter when it turned out he was, after all, very, very bad at juggling— and as much as Helena dislikes misrepresentation, she doesn't want to frighten him off altogether. It's best to reveal herself little by little, she thinks— though she doesn't admit the thought to herself, not outright— and let him get used to her. Then there was the girl who was such a freak that the circus ran away to join her . Right. \"I like drawing.\" \"But not with pens.\" \"No, not since— well.\" She smiles at him, to make him forget that the sentence was going somewhere. There's no good place for that sentence to go. Not while she's trying to be honest with him. He obliges and moves on. \"I always wondered what would happen if drawings were able to come to life, like in children's stories,\" he says brightly. Helena jumps, just a little. \"I'll have to tell you some time,\" she says. \"Um?\" says Jason, vaguely, and curious. \"But not now,\" says Helena. The itch makes her fingers curl, and she fists her hands together and decides to believe, today, that she is strong. She dreams, that night, that there's an owl in the tree outside the caravan. Or maybe it's not a dream, maybe it's an actual owl. It's hard to tell while she's sleeping; the lines of things get messed up, like a charcoal drawing with a careless artist, all smudge and bleed-over. But it doesn't sound like an actual owl. It's speaking, for one thing. Not in English. The words are strange, some other language, some other meanings to syllables that seem half-familiar. The eyes of the owl— which she can't see, but she knows this anyway, that a dreamer's insistence on certainty in impossible situations— are refracting the light of the stars, half-hollow, milky shallow bowls with pits of blackness floating in them. The owl, she thinks, may be related in some convoluted way to the sphinxes that she recalls from the old lady's house, in that other world where once she was. And the advice then was Don't let them see that you're afraid. But the owl looks at her through the window, and with a voice full of innocence it insinuates— somehow, she's not clear on this point— that if she would do it the favor of promising to obey, then it would bow and be her slave. Would give her everything she asks, and more. But the lack of clarity can only mean that she's waking up, to a muzzy sort of headache and an aching sort of vagueness, a sense of loss. She's irritable for the day. She sets into the feeling of it early on, when her father tells her to eat breakfast. Something in Helena goes click, and this Voice comes out, the Voice of Irritability, a Voice that she hasn't heard since the other Helena took over her life and started macking on random boys in Helena's bedroom, without Helena's permission. Her father stands back. Helena covers her mouth, but it's too late, and the pattern is set. \"Oh, I wish I could just go back to sleep,\" she says, miserably, but her father doesn't hear, and her mother isn't there. Jason, eyes bright, comes up to her with something he's found on the circus grounds, some random object left behind by the crowds of the night before. \"Look,\" he says, and that's not the end of the sentence, but she holds out a hand. \"Let me just— stop you there. I'm really not in the mood for it.\" \"But it's—\" It's something shiny, it winks between his fingers when the sun hits it just right. Helena shakes her head. This is entirely the wrong day for something shiny. Jason develops a look of disappointment, but shrugs manfully and closes his fingers over the object a bit more tightly. The shine is cut off abruptly, his fingers an eclipse. \"D'you think I should put it in the lost and found?\" \"Oh, put yourself in the lost and found,\" says the Voice of Irritability, and Helena runs away before it can make her say anything else. She still can't find any pencils. The picture in her head is taking shape, grasping at clarity, and she can't get it out. She gets her wish, in the end, and goes to bed early. Still she tosses and turns for what seems like hours; but when the moon is blotted out abruptly by a curtain of clouds, she doesn't know it. The darkness wraps around her, and in it the voice of the owl echoes, asking her cautiously who. \"Who what,\" says Helena, the Voice still clinging desperately to her, claws digging deep. \"Just who do you think you are?\" says the owl, but it sounds like a man, a man with a deep and deliberate voice, slow and insulting, stress on the words like color, like dressing, dripping into the cracks of the nonexistent conversation and demanding that she explain herself. But Helena is sleeping, so she puts her hands on her hips and answers without fear. \"I draw worlds, and have them come to life,\" she says. \"That's enough for you to be getting on with, now, isn't it?\" There's a pregnant pause, which gives birth to a slow laugh, ancient as time. \"I've given you a vision,\" says the owl. \"And what have you done with it? Helena.\" She doesn't stop to wonder how he knows her name. This is a dream, which means she's the most important person in it. Everyone knows who she is. \"I can't find a pencil,\" she says. \"And I don't want to use a pen.\" \"Oh, really?\" The voice is arch. Helena fidgets. \"I'm afraid,\" she says, simply. \"Excuses,\" says the owl, and she can see him shaking his head. \"Such a pity.\" She's about to argue, but she wakes up instead. Awake, eyes still closed, the vision is clear, the owl is still there. Soundless, now, but eyes alert, watching her, and if she concentrates she can see it breathing. In, and slowly out, and slowly in, steady as a heartbeat, as a distant drum, soundless as the monster under the bed. She wanders a bit, the next day. She wanders past the main tent, past the caravans lined up around the backward curve of it. It's raining, drearily, as though even the weather can't manage much enthusiasm. She wanders through the ticket counter (deserted) and ducks under the tent set up for the Bearded Lady to work her whiles. The Bearded Lady has been demanding her own tent for a while now, but only recently has Helena's father acquiesced. The Bearded Lady is a diva. She wanders past Jason, who is raking out the horse pens. He stands still when he sees her, and puts both hands on top of the rake, just watching her. She feels ashamed. \"Hi,\" she says. \"Hi,\" he responds, and his caution is almost painful. But entirely, entirely deserved. So she stands for a moment, and looks at him; and he leans on the rake, and looks at her. \"Sorry,\" she says, finally, and surfs the wake of his smile as she hurries away. She wanders into the Miscellaneous Tent, and is passing the box of Lost and Found items (a handkerchief, an umbrella, a handful of muddy stuffed animals, someone's jacket, a fountain pen, a picked-over wallet, and an incongruous set of barbells) when the gleam of something silver catches her eye. She wheels, marches back to it, and rummages about in the box. The gleam of something silver is an owl, small enough to fit in the palm of her hand but still oddly large for an apparently pointless piece of statuary. There's nothing to indicate that it was a pendant or piece of jewelry, nothing to indicate its purpose at all. There's no mud on it, and she wonders if it was like that, or if Jason wiped it off after he found it. It has the look of keeping itself clean. It's a silver version of the picture in her head. She watches it, closely, to see what it does; and draws the fountain pen out of the box. There's paper in a drawer. She seats herself at one of the picnic tables outside, under the high-arched, open tent set up for eating purposes. The stack of paper is thick enough that, when she begins to draw, the rough and uneven wood makes no difference in the smoothness of the line. The fountain pen is easy, draws quick and sure as an Old-West gunfighter, and she has a moment of guilt for not holding out for the pencil after all. The surge of fear is beaten down, though, by a moment of practicality. It's too late, anyhow. She draws a series of straight lines, aimlessly, and sets to connecting them. Under her careful hand, it takes shape and form. Becomes a hallway, down which one might walk, only to be confronted with sets of stairways, straight and wide or narrow and curved, going this way and that and leading nowhere in particular. She draws like she's setting out to confuse someone, as though this paper is a maze in which she can trap her enemies. She shades it in, adds dimension. Frowns and concentrates and creates. The wind comes up, sure and certain-handed, and whips away the top page, sending the roomful of stairways tumbling through the air. Helena yelps and starts from the wooden bench; but the paper is gone from sight in an instant. There's no catching it. She subsides back into her seat. \"I gave you a vision,\" she says to the paper, thoughtfully, \"and— what have you done with it? Helena. What have you done with it, Helena?\" The silver owl is heavy, and holds the paper down. She draws. The vision in her head, and the silver version here in front of her, combine in every particular; she puts them onto the paper, gives them reality in pen, the shallow shining eyes, watching her as she watches them. The white face, flat and round, and the curve of the beak that looks almost conciliatory. She puts a fine point on it, for catching mice. As she draws, the owl on the paper looks at her. It does not blink, and maybe doesn't really move at all, but she's nonetheless certain that it's watching her now. She sits in the gaze of the pen-and-ink owl and the silver owl and she wonders just how much watching she can take. It's a creeping sort of feeling, but exciting too, the feeling of riding a bicycle down a steep hill but believing that the brakes could fail at any moment. Exhilarating— that's the word for what she's feeling, and there's no reason for it, but she feels it all the same. She smudges the ink, just a little, and the paper jumps sideways as the wind comes up again. It whips some dust from the circus grounds into her eyes and she closes them, turning her head to one side, hardly able to breathe with the sudden force of it. When she opens her eyes, the world isn't there. Instead, there's space, and for a blind white moment she thinks of a story told to her: In the beginning there was the page. But the light fades and shapes grow, shadows wrap themselves into their proper mimicries, and stairs are built where once there was nothing. She knows this— she drew it, moments ago. But it seems a very long time indeed, and there is dust on her fingertips along with the ink. The owl is there, too, and it flutters about her head before it settles almost awkwardly down a few feet from her, perched on the edges of a steep set of stairs that leads to nowhere. It shuffles a step or two, unruffling its feathers, and twists its head to one side uncomfortably. It's looking at her the way it looked at her from the flat white stretch of the paper, and what once was ink is now bodied and real. The eyes are no less shallow for that. Helena takes a breath to speak, but the world skips sideways for just the smallest of seconds, a tiny jet bead of time, and the owl has grown, has thrown off its shape, has taken on a new. There stands a man, tall and sleek, with narrow shoulders and narrowed eyes, piercing and shallow as the owl's. Helena raises her hand. She's still holding the pen, and in the air she writes as he speaks. \"Well, well,\" he says, and with each breath and each syllable something about him rounds out and becomes more real, and there's a definite quirk at the edge of his mouth, like he knows something she doesn't— which is likely true. \"Look who's here.\" She swallows, and bites her lip, and concentrates. Writes his name in the air, signs it for him, knows his name and names him all at once. Jareth , she writes, and it's the truth. ","Summary":" Title: Then There Was The Girl (1/?) Fandom: MirrorMask/Labyrinth . I know, I know. I'm crazy. Rati"},{"Movie":"MirrorMask","Title":"Onwards and Upwards","Author":"EE's Skysong","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5571685","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: \"Had you known him long?\" \"Who?\" (An: This is just my own take on Valentine's past (AKA an explanation of why he was so down on himself in my other fic, \"With Whom to Dance\") and an extrapolation on the co-dreaming touched on in the film... oh, by the way, I realized after the fact that I named Val's girlfriend after the girl from Labyrinth, but that was a coincidence, I assure you.) He didn't love her, not really. He liked to run his fingers through her hair, yes, he liked kissing her (especially when she did that thing with the tongue), yes, but did she bore him? Very yes. Just like everyone else. And he had honestly thought she knew this as well. Obviously, he couldn't bore her—he was Valentine , after all—but he figured he had made it quite clear that he was not taking this relationship at all seriously. A jar of face cream smashed on the wall three inches from his head. Apparently not. At least Sarah's stage of throwing things appeared to be over. She was kneeling now, and shaking, and crying, and going on about all sorts of things that made him feel horrible. It was just a kiss! Valentine thought, although he wasn't quite stupid enough to say it out loud. (Valentines had a crazy amount of business sense, but not much when it came to people. But it wasn't a good idea to further enrage Sarah when she still had an arsenal of makeup at her disposal.) \"You're an awful, awful man,\" said Sarah, wiping her eyes and looking up at him. The pain in her eyes wrenched at his heart, but still not enough to make him feel bad. It was only a kiss, his stubborn mind repeated. Nothing to get so upset over . Valentine shrugged a little, still backed up against the wall, just in case her fury blazed up again. \"I am who I am,\" he replied. \"I'm Valentine.\" Her lips twitched. \"Yes, and that's exactly the problem, isn't it?\" She sniffled, and that wrenched at his heart a little more. He needed to get out of here, or he'd start feeling—ugh— guilty . There was no point in feeling bad about things; one had to accept what was and move on, hopefully forgetting about what had happened as you did. Sarah hugged herself. She was shaking again. \"It wouldn't be so bad,\" she mumbled, \"if you'd just apologize…\" She looked up at him again and held his gaze with her own. Oh, dear. He really had to leave. \"But you won't, will you?\" She affected his lilt, only her voice was far more bitter than he could ever manage: \" Valentines never apologize.\" Ouch. That was uncalled for, even though it was true. Wounded, he mumbled, \"It was just a kiss.\" Sarah stared at him for a moment, as though she absolutely couldn't believe he'd said that, and then she laughed. \" Just a kiss, was it? Just a kiss, when we've been dating for over a year? Just a kiss, when you hardly ever kiss me ?\" Her voice cracked a little on that last word. \"Well, when you put it that way…\" His voice was light, nervous, and that seemed to offend her. \"Get out,\" she said, standing up. \"Get out. Go back to that damn flat of yours, and don't bother coming back.\" \"But—my things—\" Sarah put her hands on her hips. \"That's the way it'll always be with you, won't it, Valentine? You, you, you. What will you get out of it? What profit's there to be made? You make it seems like there's so much more to you, but there's not.\" She swiped the back of her hand across her face; she was crying again. \"Just go. I'll bring your stuff when I can look you in the eye again.\" She pointed at the door. There was no arguing with those tears. He hated when girls cried. It always seemed so low of them. Valentine sighed and walked away. O-o-O-o-O Usually, sitting on his bed in his tower made him feel like thinking his own thoughts—like writing. But now all he could think about was the encounter with Sarah. This was not normal. Girls were girls, and feelings were feelings, and he'd never gotten the one confused with the other. So he knew he wasn't thinking like this because of… sentimentality. It wasn't his stuff, either. Stuff was stuff. He probably wasn't going to get it back, so there was nothing to do but wonder how he was going to replace it. It wasn't that big of a deal, anyway. Out of sight, out of mind was always a strategy that worked for him. So then… what? Was he honestly still feeling bad because of those tears of hers? He'd made girls cry before—admittedly, they hadn't been girls he knew so well, but still. It wasn't anything new. No, it wasn't the tears. It was what she had said. \"You're an awful, awful man.\" Was that true? Were Valentines awful? They were wonderful, of course, but what was wonderful wasn't always good. Well. Who said he wanted to be good, anyway? Good was boring, and Valentines were anything but. Valentines were fascinating. Valentines were marvelous. Valentines were… were... were hated by their mothers. Hadn't his mum said the same thing when he moved out? \"You'll never make anything of yourself, you know, lad, dreaming the way you do. Your father would be ashamed of you.\" She hadn't called him that world— awful —but the disgust in her eyes had certainly implied it. And what right had she, anyway? She hadn't even been his real mum. His birth mother had died years ago. Valentine rolled over on his stomach and propped his head on his arms. This was not at all like him. Valentines did not brood. Valentines moved on. \"Onwards and upwards,\" said Valentine, nodding. So why was he still thinking about it? Valentine looked at his dresser, and then he got a grand idea. He would call Bing. Bing always made him feel better. O-o-O-o-O Bing was certainly a man after Valentine's own heart. \"So you broke up with Sarah? Eh, she was a drag anyway.\" \"It wasn't exactly a breakup. Things were broken, though.\" \"Not you, I'd hope.\" There was a loud thump and a curse from the other end of the line as Bing fudged up his juggling. \"So what was her problem?\" \"I may have kissed another girl, and she may have caught me,\" Valentine mumbled. \"You know, nothing big.\" Bing whistled. \"That is something most girls frown upon, mate. Why'd you do it?\" Why? Valentine had never stopped to consider a why. Why s required looking back, and that was not something Valentine was fond of doing. The girl—he hadn't bothered to catch her name—had been pretty and interested; it seemed like a fun way to waste a little time. He hadn't meant to hurt anyone. He was just bored, and when he was bored, it got him into trouble. \"Because she was there, I guess.\" There was a long pause from the other side of the line. Bing was thinking. Oh, dear. When thinking didn't get Bing into a mess, it made him dreadfully uninteresting. \"Well… that was mean,\" said Bing. \"Did you at least apologize?\" Valentine had to stare at the phone for a moment. He thought Bing knew better than to ask such a silly question. Bing, after all, knew him better than most people. But, he supposed, Bing was just an ordinary person, not like himself, and therefore he could be just as stupid as everyone else sometimes. \"Of course I didn't!\" There was another pause. \"I like Sarah,\" said Bing quietly. \"I thought you did too.\" Valentine blinked, absolutely flabbergasted. Of course he liked Sarah. He liked Sarah just fine (although maybe not as much anymore now that she had thrown things at him). But liking wasn't enough to keep him interested—very little was, unless it involved money or juggling. Bing seemed to sense his surprise, and he sighed. \"So what are you guys going to do?\" \"Well, we've already broken up, so-\" \"About the business, you nitwit.\" Now Bing sounded a bit more normal. Like Valentine, he shared a love of all things commercial. \"I thought we were going to run it together, but if Sarah's not speaking to you...\" Valentine, as usual, hadn't thought that far ahead, and, as usual, he didn't let that bother him. \"You guys can still take over. I'll find my own work for now, and when Sarah cools off, I'll join you.\" \"Where will you work?\" Valentine huffed. Why was everyone so concerned with the future and the past? The now was all that mattered; the past couldn't be changed, and, if one were a talented Valentine and knew how to improvise, the future would fall into place, like near the end of a jigsaw. Yes, he had only a Liberal Arts degree to his name, but he would figure something out. The bookshop the three of them had wanted to buy had been a nice idea, but apparently it wasn't the right fit for him now. \"Onwards and upwards, mate,\" Valentine replied. Now it was Bing's turn to huff. He recognized Valentine's trademark sendoff and knew nothing would make him extend the conversation. \"All right, bye. Take care of yourself.\" Valentine hung up, shaking his head at the silliness of that statement. Who else was there to take care of? O-o-O-o-O When Valentine woke up in the maskworld (as he thought of it), he wasn't the least bit confused by his new attire or dismayed that he couldn't seem to get the mask off. No more constant queries of \"What were you thinking, Valentine?\"—it was right there, written all over his face, and if the other person was too dim to figure it out, well, that was their problem. Valentine was very good at adapting to new situations; after a few days in the maskworld, he forgot there was any other life at all. He had even found someone who reminded him very much of Bing—or, at least, the man would have if Valentine had any recollections of Bing. All in all, a very good life. And he certainly didn't want to do anything to mess it up. He was a very important man here, after all. And then he saw the girl. He couldn't help but be dreadfully curious about how she had gotten her mask off. He had tried—Valentines were handsome, and he rather missed the sight of his face—but instead he ended up with his hands full of duplicate masks, all babbling at him about the best way to con his neighbors out of their pocket money or new juggling tricks. Much too weird. The world only needed one Valentine, after all. But when he saw her strut down the street with her nose in the air and her arms crossed, her sneer suggesting she owned the place and her black eyes flashing, his first instinct was to ask her how she'd managed it. Valentines should know everything, after all—or at least where to find out. As he got closer, he realized she had to be from the Dark Lands. He'd never been, but he'd seen a picture of the Queen of Shadows, and this girl had hair just like hers... although the queen at least had a normal face. He didn't approach her directly; the Dark Lands were quite dodgy. Best to be cautious, see if she sent shadows first and asked questions later. But she still spotted him while he was several feet away and whirled on him. \"Where is the palace?\" Ooh, she was sharpish. Almost a girl after his own heart—except she was too scary. Those black eyes and that shifty face—ooh! Like a scary story. \"It's, uh, that way,\" said Valentine, pointing. He was quite eager to be rid of her company now that he had it. \"Giant shiny paperweight. You can't miss it.\" \"I won't.\" She linked arms with him. \"You'll be taking me there.\" Oh, boy. This was definitely a bad deal. Her grip on his arm was iron-tight, and her smile dared him to protest. \"Okay, good idea,\" he said, trying to sound bright. From the way her sneer lengthened, he knew it hadn't worked. He led her down the high street as quickly as possible, avoiding meeting her creepy eyes. They were like proper eyes, only shinier… and somehow emptier. She was making him think too much—wasn't that why he had cheated on Sarah? …who was Sarah? Valentine shook himself. \"Onwards and upwards,\" he muttered, trying to dislodge the strange thought. Thank goodness the palace wasn't too far from here. O-o-O-o-O It wasn't turning out to be such a good dream after all. Here he was with all of the things he could ever want in life: jewels, a hat, fish to bathe in... and all he could think about was Helena and his tower. He wanted his tower even more than usual. What was the point of having all this pretty stuff if he didn't have a tower to put it in? So frivolous. That didn't mean he was going to apologize or anything like that, but he still missed it. And Helena... damn every thought he had of her. Why did she stick in his mind so? He had no memories of his parents beyond a vague feeling of betrayal, and the only other thing of a girl he could remember was a name—Sarah, or maybe Sandy... something with an S , anyway. So why did he remember Helena? He remembered her face, and her name, and the way her face was shifty and disgusting and still somehow quite lovely. What was the good of betraying somebody if you couldn't forget them afterward? If you didn't forget, it left you with all those disgusting guilty feelings, and it turned all your pretty things to ash that blew away in the wind. That girl! Oh, she made him feel so… she made him feel , and wasn't that bad enough? He was not supposed to second-guess his actions because he was not supposed to remember them afterwards. Valentines did not work like that. Valentines charmed and juggled and made money, but they did not feel—at least, not anything that lasted for more than a moment or two. And especially nothing as irritating as guilt. After all, he had no coping strategies for guilt. When he was lonely, there was always a willing girl. When he was sad, there was always money to be made. But guilt… Well… maybe he'd go and see her. Just a quick visit. He was a clever boy: surely he'd find a way into the dark palace without anyone noticing! O-o-O-o-O When he woke up, he was vaguely aware that he'd changed. It was an odd way to feel: he'd only been asleep, after all, and, as he was already perfect, there was nothing that needed changing. But he felt like he'd gone to bed with socks on and woken up with galoshes—something weird like that. Half-awake, he stumbled over to the mirror and took a good look at himself. He half-expected to see a mask—but that was just in his dream. Even Valentines didn't have dreams that turned out to be true. Letting out a deep breath, he studied himself in the mirror. Nope. Nothing had changed. He was still as perfect as ever—and yet he couldn't shake that feeling of difference. He remembered, suddenly, that he was no longer welcome at Sarah's house, which meant that he would no longer be welcome at their business establishment. A sudden pang of loss struck him—which made absolutely no sense, as Valentines never regretted. Valentines never had anything to regret! Shaking his head at his own foolishness, Valentine got dressed and decided to go for a walk. Perhaps an idea would strike him—that was what he had always done during his brief stint in college, when the drudgery of daily exercises and a schedule that had to be kept chipped his inspiration down to nothing. Someone had taped a poster to his door, a poster for a circus. Valentine looked at it for a moment before tearing it off the door. He didn't want a destination, but it couldn't hurt to stop over, could it…? (So… ending might be a little abrupt, but there's nowhere I could go that I haven't already.)

He had a day named after him. Helena may have rolled her eyes at that but she knew it too. She knew it so well, she decided to do something to prove it to him. Helena/Valentine. Implied Helena/Anti-Valentine. Songfic. Genre: Romance/Humor Rated: T for suggestive themes and language A/N: After watching Mirrormask for the umpteenth time yesterday, I finally decided on writing a story on it. Certainly took me long enough. Yes, I know Valentine's Day was eons back but this plot bunny was practically gnawing on my head so just read it for some fun. 'Valentine' belongs to Kina Grannis. Valentine watched, somewhat hypnotized at the spectacle of golden balls expertly launched from his left hand and landing into his right. Juggling was always his special talent. The merest hint of a smile appeared on his lips as he remembered someone else who possessed such a talent. Of course, she was nowhere as good as he! No one could out-juggle Valentines. Now, with a much more obvious smirk of pure smugness on his face, he quickened his juggling pace. Valentines were considered the most graceful jugglers in all of the Mirror Realm she created. Next to being very important men with nary an apologetic bone in their arrogant bodies. Still mesmerized by the perfect cycle the golden orbs created as he juggled them, Valentine found his thoughts derailing to the memories of a certain girl. No, not girl. Well, not anymore. She was a woman now. It had been over three years since they-well mostly she -woke up the White Queen and rescued the Mirror Realm from being plunged into endless shadows. Three years since he led the Princess of Shadows back to her rightful kingdom, the Land of Shadows. She may have expressed enormous reluctance and fought him off on numerous occasions but he managed to somehow wrestle the wildcat of a princess back to her mother. The Shadow Queen had been gracious enough to give him another batch of 'as many jewels as he could carry' and he put a lot of it to good use. For instance, he had purchased a new set of glittering crystal juggling balls. He wouldn't dare admit it but those balls weren't exactly meant for his skillful juggling hands. They were meant for her . If he weren't a Valentine, he'd confess it long ago that he missed her desperately. It became an almost addiction for him to stare into windows leading to her world just to see her improper-yet exquisite-face. For those torturous three years, he had to watch her grow up. And how she had grown up! Her mousy brown hair was no longer short and unkempt. It was a luscious chestnut brown and cascaded way past her shoulders. Her face grew womanly and defined with fuller lips, prominent cheekbones and darker eyes. Her body grew voluptuous in all the right places but was still slender. All in all, she had matured into a very beautiful young woman. Valentine had been in awe once when he saw her enter her room in nothing more than a red lacy camisole and matching shorts. He had blushed pink and turned away; Valentines weren't lecherous. However, temptation had hooked and reeled him in and he dared another peek. She was primping at her vanity, brushing her now longer, wavier locks. He had just stood there, gaping and embarrassingly, feeling rather uncomfortable down below. His tower didn't let him live it down for two weeks after he left hurriedly for the bathroom after watching Helena stand up, stretch and head to bed. Oh, did he there one day confess he was deeply, passionately, undoubtedly in love with her? Sometimes, he wondered if he ever did, it would be of any use. His juggling abruptly stopped as his mind was flooded with a much more bitter memory. One he wished would be erased from his brain forever. His once reminiscing smile soured into a vengeful frown. Of course, how could he not remember the boy ? The boy referred to that awful, improper-faced doppelganger of his. It sickened him how in her world there was a spitting image of him! Valentines were absolute perfection; there wasn't supposed to be clones of them. However, unfortunately, he had seen this horrible clone of his. Helena had invited him into her trailer and Valentine noted him with as much disgust as a jealous third party could note him with. His name was Vincent and he was as alike as Valentine as two peas in a pod. They were the same height, same build, had the same hair, eyes, face and even the same Irish accent. It was plain revolting to the masked juggler. Especially when he observed, with a jarring blow to his heart, Helena laughing so happily with him. Valentine had sneered with distaste; that idiotic twin of his must have told her a humorous anecdote. Probably an anecdote he himself could have made her laugh like that with. He tormented himself, watching them with sheer concentration. Watching Vincent sling his arm around her shoulders, nuzzling his face against her neck and letting Helena rest against his shoulder. Watching the bastard kiss her lovingly, gently on her beautiful red lips. \"Stupid maskless copycat!\" Valentine silently cursed. He then plopped down onto the windowsill of his tower and looked out. It was a brilliant starry night. He immediately turned away from the twinkling stars when he was reminded of Helena's twinkling eyes. He mused bitterly over Vincent and Helena, all the while fiddling with the golden balls in his hands. Maybe that's why she doesn't visit me much nowadays. She's too busy entertaining her new boyfriend! Boyfriend, the word struck excruciatingly through his frame and he shuddered. She was happy. So happy that she had forgotten him. Well, fine! Let her forget him! He did not care! Another thing about Valentines; they were so full of bullshit. He sighed and decided to entertain himself with looking wistfully out the window again. He was so entranced with the beauteous night sky that he did not hear someone enter his chambers or detected the delicious aroma of fresh baking and the lovely scent of dreamy lilacs. It wasn't until he heard someone clearing her throat that he turned. And stared in bewilderment. Helena. Standing there just a few feet away from him with a parcel in her hands. The parcel emitted a most glorious aroma of chocolate and spices. She put it down gently on the floor. Valentine also noticed she had a strange instrument slung around her shoulder. He had seen her play it before and sing when he looked through the windows. Apparently, it was a gee-tar or something like that. She stood there, smiling at him demurely. If he wasn't so in awe of her presence, he would've turned away in a huff. She deserved that after leaving him for so long. But, he'd be lying if he did actually have the heart to do that. So, he just sat there and stared at her. Waiting for an icebreaker, a conversation starter. Strangely, all she did was sling the gee-tar around so it was at her front and he watched as her slender fingers strummed the weird-looking translucent strings. Valentine sat entranced as Helena, his Helena, began to sing. Love, It's a special day, We should celebrate, And appreciate, That you, She smiled, winking even to him. He just sat there, mouth agape. Her voice was magnificent . And me, Found something pretty neat, And I know some say this day is arbitrary, Wait, what day was today? Valentine's eyes traveled across the room before landing onto the calendar Helena had introduced into the Mirror Realm. 14th February blared back at him. But it's a good excuse, put our love to use, Baby, I know what to do, Baby, I…I will love you, I'll love you, I'll love you, Even though it was clearly not obvious since he wore his mask, under it Valentine was positively gleeful. She…had just said she loved him. She had! But then, what of Vincent? He wanted to interrupt to question her but her smile tamed him from doing so. Her song almost had him under a hypnotic spell of some sort. Love, I don't need those things, I don't need no ring, I don't need anything, Valentine felt slightly embarrassed at her words; she was nowhere near as materialistic as he was. Still, he hoped to God she would like the crystal balls he purchased for her. She should! Those things cost half his jewel haul! But you, with me, Cause in your company, I feel happy, oh so happy and complete, As much as he tried to hide it, a smile blossomed on his face. He was trying so hard to look unmoved as he was angry at her sudden disappearance for three years and getting his doppelganger for a boyfriend. However, to hear her sing like that with the loveliest smile on her face was too much. Admittedly, he always found her improper face prettiest when those mobile lips of hers curved into a smile. Yeah, it's a good excuse, Put our love to use, Baby, I know what to do, Baby, I…I will love you, I'll love you, I'll love you, At this point, she stopped playing for a while and stooped down to pick up her parcel. Valentine tried his best to not look directly at her cleavage as she bent down. She was wearing a lovely spaghetti strap top in the exact same shade of red as his shirt with a pair of comfortable denim jeans. Such apparel drew attention to her slender body. He blushed and distracted himself by looking at his hands. She then approached him, a most loving smile on her face. Her chocolate eyes twinkled more beautifully than the stars above as she presented him the parcel. Valentine wasted no time. He tore it open and lifted the lid. His mouth hung open. It was a cake. Homemade but impressive! The strong scent of honey and cinnamon permeated the room as he lifted the cake out. It was thickly and amateurishly frosted in dark chocolate and had the most whimsical marzipan bee on the top. Below the bee were the words, in cursive white chocolate frosting, 'Be my Valentine.' So won't you be my honey bee? Giving me kisses all the time, Be mine, Be my Valentine, He just stared, stone still at the cake. He was in disbelief, grateful, confused and suspicious all in one. He looked up as she sang. The lyrics rang in his ears. So won't you be my honey bee? Giving me sweet kisses all the time, Be mine, Be my Valentine, Ohhh, Oh woah, be my Valentine… The minute she stopped, she practically dove into his arms and rested her head against his chest. The sheer scent of her lilac perfume caused him to go weak in the knees slightly. He eagerly returned the hug. She was here! Here with him! In his arms, not Vincent's! Ha! Valentine never felt more victorious. \"I'm sorry,\" He looked down, a little surprised by her muffled apology and she pulled away from him, looking very ashamed. \"I'm…sorry for well…abandoning you.\" Valentine found himself folding his arms; oh he remembered. He was angry at her for leaving him for three years with some other boy . \"Well you should be! What do you call leaving your manager here all alone for three bloody years? And going off in your world snogging a boy that, sickeningly, looks exactly like me despite his disgusting, maskless face, while your juggling associate and supposedly best friend is waiting for you?\" \"Valentine…\" \"And having the nerve to come back here…\" \"Valentine…\" \"Singing some bloody song and giving me a bloody cake…\" \"Valentine…\" \"Thinking it will make it up to me in some way…\" \"VALENTINE!\" \"Oh don't you go interrupting…Mmph!\" His raging tirade was- thankfully -ended when Helena grabbed him by his shirt lapels and mashed their lips together in a most passionate kiss. Valentine's eyes widened beneath his mask before he melted into the kiss. He slid his arms around her and simply went with the smooth flow of the lip lock. He heard her moan slightly, making pride and affection swell up in his chest. He was pretty sure that idiotic twin of his couldn't kiss her like this so ballocks to him! The minute she pulled away, leaving him dazed and somewhat bereft, she had a most teasing dazzle to her smile. \"Shut up so I can explain, ok?\" She directed him to sit down. He did so, still enjoying the aftershocks of such a powerful kiss. \"Now, when I came back into the Real World, I realized my mom was the only one whom knew about my dream since she had the very same one. So, I confided in her about this world, the mask and yes, even you. Mom was very supportive and said I could come back whenever I wanted to. But, unfortunately, I couldn't come back very soon. Miraculously, after Mom got better, it was as if a spot of good luck struck the circus and business boomed tremendously. I was needed almost every night and Dad was even looking for some new circus acts. Which brings me to…\" At this point, she took a moment to inhale before continuing to say the name that Valentine dreaded the most. \"Vincent.\" \"Oh yes, my squishy-faced clone,\" Valentine muttered, his voice dripping sarcasm. Helena playfully punched him. \"Hey, he's a nice guy alright?\" Valentine glared through his mask before sourly adding. \"So nice that you are so fond of him to the point of snogging him huh?\" Helena rolled her eyes, sighing. \"Ok, firstly, Vincent and I have never 'snogged'. We have only cordially kissed. Once.\" Valentine listened intently though he tried his best to look aloof. \"Secondly, I realized he just wasn't the one. I….broke up with him a week before.\" Valentine did not say a word though inside, he was on cloud nine. \"And lastly, I realized the only reason I was with him was because…because…he…he reminded me of someone I really missed and loved.\" Valentine's heart was standing before the brink of a heavenly abyss. \"W…Who is this…person?\" Helena twiddled with her fingers and in a sing-song, flirtatious voice hinted, \"Well, for one thing, he's a very important man…well, he thinks he is.\" Valentine couldn't repress a smile at that one. \"He's got a magnificent tower.\" The smile grew. \"He's stubborn, annoying, arrogant, cocky, witty, condescending, selfish, looks upon me with disgust and contempt and is full of himself.\" The smile grew to the point of his face starting to ache. The degrading description just washed over him like a gentle summer's breeze. \"He's also there for me when I need him. Especially when I needed him most,\" Her voice was nothing more than a small whisper now. \"He may have sold me out to the Shadow Queen for an armful of pathetic rubies but he came back. He always does. He's also an excellent juggler and ten times funnier than all the jesters in the world combined. I've always hoped we could one day bathe in fish, eat our weight in chocolate buttons and play the concertina.\" Valentine was currently treading on the highest level of heaven now at hearing her describe her mystery man with such longing. Helena smirked; she knew that masked marauder knew her perfect man from a mile away. \"I miss him so much. Sometimes, I wish I could tell him how I feel…and hopefully…he might feel the same way too,\" Valentine immediately sling his arm around her shoulder after her last word and dipped his head so he could whisper huskily into her ear. \"He does, my juggling associate. Believe me, he does.\" Helena smiled as a sigh of content left her. She turned and embraced him, not wanting to let go. \"Happy Valentine's Day…my honey bee,\" She teasingly kissed him on the corner of his lips. Valentine smirked before nuzzling his face against hair. See, he was a very important man after all! He had his own very special day named after him! \"Now, Helena…since I'm you honey bee…what about those sweet kisses?\" A/N: And finito! Hopefully, this delights your day.

Beautiful intricate clocks lined the wall, including the dark blue one that had swung inward to let me into this strange place. Soft mechanical ticks pounded at my ears, somehow getting louder for every second that passed. Nine clunky cylinders lined the wall with a tenth sitting right in the middle of the room. I leaned over the closest one, intent on opening it and seeing what was inside, when the panels on top shuddered. Suddenly, all the tops slowly opened like giant metal flowers blooming in the sun. Dolls with masks for faces and arms draped in golden cloth rose up like jack-in-the-boxes and smiled at me. Fear trickled down my spine as they began to sing some sort of lullaby and, joints creaking, reached out their hands toward me. Why do birds suddenly appear Every time you are near? I backed away, trying to find the dark blue clock that was the door out of this crazy place. Before I could reach the door, the dolls straightened up, flinging sparkly gold dust into the air and suddenly...I didn't want to leave anymore. Just like me, they long to be Close to you. Gentle hands stroked my hair, caressing it in a way that my mother never had. Their soft touches were filled with so much love that my heart nearly burst. Feeling ashamed that it had taken sixteen years for me to feel this kind of all-enveloping love, I began to cry again. I tried to wipe my tears away with the edge of my nightgown, but I couldn't. There were too many. Why do stars fall down from the sky Every time you walk by? The dolls cooed and gently wiped away my tears for me, slowly and carefully untangling all the knots and snarls in my hair at the same time. Relaxing into their calming touch, I closed my eyes and let them do what they wanted to me. Once my eyes were fully shut, they began to delicately trace and color in my eyelids. Without even looking in a mirror, I was willing to bet that they had done an amazing job, yet another thing my mother had never managed to do. She always laid the makeup on too thick or too thin, always in too much of a hurry to really focus on me for more than a few seconds at a time. Just like me, they long to be Close to you. Finishing up with my eyes, they slid a fresh layer of lip gloss over my lips with all the precision of a team of surgeons. Pulling my hands closer to themselves, they painted a thin coat of a deep black polish, blowing over them to help the paint dry quicker and prevent smudges. On the day that you were born The angels got together And decided to create a dream come true, Examining my new nails happily, my eyes widened as the doll from the center of the room lifted a gorgeous long black gown out of her cylinder. She passed it to the other dolls and, together, they gently tugged the dress onto me, careful not to mess up my new nails and hair. So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And starlight in your eyes of blue. It fit perfectly, hugging my body warmly without suffocating me to death in its embrace. As if it had been handmade by people who actually cared about making me look...beautiful. That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around. Heat pooled in the corners of my eyes and my breath snagged in my throat. I knew that these dolls were just lifeless objects, only animated to dress me as the Dark Queen saw fit. But right now...right now I didn't care about that. In less than eight minutes they had shown me more love and caring than anyone had ever showed me before in my life. I loved them. Just like me, they long to be Close to you. Dry sobs wracked my body and the dolls cooed at me again, gently caressing my arms, hair, and back in an effort to calm me down. Embracing their touches, I swallowed my tears and smiled at them. Maybe the Dark Queen had been right about one thing after all. Just like me (just like me) They long to be Maybe, by making the outside happy, you could make the inside happy too. The dolls smiled back at me and, after placing light kisses on my forehead, pointed towards the door. I bowed low, like a Princess should, and thanked each of them in turn. Close to you Close to you. Walking carefully measured steps out of the room, I held back my tears. I truly loved those dolls and it nearly broke my heart in two to leave them so soon. Another thought struck me and my heart almost curled in on itself and died from sadness right then. If I fixed this world and left the Dark Queen's palace for my own world I would never see them again. I would go back to living in an emotional void, where I went without human contact for days and the only people I did see did not love me as much as those lifeless dolls did. My resolve to wake the White Queen and save the world weakened and crumbled away. If I could feel that kind of love every day, even if it was only coming from soulless animatronic machines, I would gladly let the world burn. Just like me, they long to be Close...to...you ","Summary":" A Pretty Frock And A Happy Smile I do not own anything, except for my spell check *laughs* but plea"},{"Movie":"Frankenweenie","Title":"Victor's Foul Play","Author":"McCRINGLEBERRY1957","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12956927","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is based off a deleted/alternate scene. With a few modifications. Frankenweenie and its canon characters belong to Disney and Tim Burton. O.C's: Me CHAPTER 1:Outcast in the Outfield Saturday In a baseball field of a local park, a coach was gathering the players in a huddle. The coach named Ben, white and enthusiastic, clear his throat to get their attention. \"Alright. Since there's more participants than intended, we'll try and change positions every inning. Understood ?\". The \"players\" in general were actually young teenagers. Large in diversity and numbers, they all chanted, \"Yes sir!\". Coach Ben: For the 1st inning, Toshiaki will pitch. The japanese teen shouted \"Yes\" and praised in his native tongue. Coach: Nassor will be umpire. A slightly tired/unimpressed middle eastern teen that resemble Boris Karloff nodded before saying, \"It shall be done.\" Coach: Bob will guard 1st base. \"Cool.\", said an obese Caucasian with a Capri-Sun in his hand. He thought cheerfully, \"Good thing the restrooms are over there.\" Coach: Scott will guard 2nd. An Italian teen with a cowlick hairstyle yawned and then gave a thumbs up saying, \"Can do, Boss!\". Coach: Mara, you'll be at 3rd. A tall, silent russian girl with big eyes and long blonde hair nodded and said, \"I shall do so.\" Coach: And finally, Victor will...wait a minute. Where's Victor? The other teens looked around until they spotted a young boy with a stout bull terrier at his side. Coach snickered. \"Enthusiastic as always. Well Victor, you're up to bat.\", said the coach, pointing at home plate. Victor didn't look impressed. If anything far from it. He was angry at the coach, and for good reason. Coach Ben was Victor's father and he (ben) was concerned about his son's antisocial solitude. So he and his wife Susan agreed on having Victor play baseball to make friends. Victor knew, because he overheard them at that time. And the thing is, they're right. Despite being super smart and a part time filmmaker (one of his hobbies), he liked to keep his Inner circle small. He did have several friends, but his closest one was his bull terrier/dachshund mix, Sparky. He could've pretended to be sick or injured, but he was too honest. So he inhaled annoyingly and made his way to home base. Even though he swallowed his pride, he still felt annoyed. As he walked to the home plate, he could've sworn he heard Toshiaki and/or Bob snickering behind his back. \"Ok. Everybody else, disperse\". Ben said to the other participants. While the other players move out of the clearing, Sparky walked to the nearest bleachers to watch Victor play. Suddenly, he heard a chirp and a flutter. He turns to his left to see a Secretary bird approached him. The dog and the bird smiled and touched noses. Then they spoke to each other. Sparky: Hi Ders. Ders: Sparks. Sparky: Where have you been? I thought you'd be with Penryck at the meeting earlier. Ders: I overslept. I forgot Pen was coming today. Where is he anyway? I don't see him on the field. Sparky: He and the others are Benchwarmers. Ders: Bummer. Sparky: Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be on the field next. Ders: O.K. Look, the game's starting. Btw, your girlfriend's coming Sparky: Where? Sparky turns to see a girl walking towards the bleachers. She was partially goth. She had a black dress, striped stockings/socks, a sombre appearance, and twin ponytails. Walking in front her was a black poodle. The poodle sat near the bottom seat (next to sparky) while the girl just stood by the bleacher. Sparky and the poodle met eyes for a moment. Sparky: Persephone. You're looking wonderful today Persephone: Thank you. Is that Victor about to bat? Sparky: Yeah. How's Elsa doing? She sure looks interested. Persephone: (smirking) in the game or Victor? While the two dogs were chatting, Ders walks off to find his owner/friend while Elsa observed the game. Victor positioned himself with an unsatisfied face. As soon as the whistle blew, Toshiaki became alert. With precision, he threw the ball. Upon seeing the ball soar, Sparky ran off the bleachers, instinct taking over. Sparky: Gotta get ball. Gotta get ball. Gotta get ball. Victor was about to hit the ball when a fat blur jumped across his face and grabbed it. It took a second to find out that the blur was sparky. Victor: what the? Aw sparky! Elsa couldn't help but giggle at the incident. The other players, however, were outright laughing. Bob and Toshiaki were pointing while holding their sides. Scott was on the ground, dying from laughter. Even Mara (who's usually quiet) was laughing for once. Aside from a slightly unfazed Victor, Nassor just cleared his throat. Ben then walked over to his son. Victor: Oh well, guess i should take him home. Ben (holding a leash out) Not at all. Just fix him to bleachers. Victor: Hmph! (snatches the leash) Come on, boy. As victor walked sparky to the bleachers, Ben called scott. Ben: Substitution, Scott. take a breather. Pen, you're up. An Afro-American with curly hair and developing sideburns heard and answered. Penryck: Nice! Coming coach. Wish me luck Ders. Ders, sitting on top of the benchwarmer booth, flapped in anticipation. 2 hours later Sparky watches Victor talking to Penryck on his cellphone. Pen: Listen Vic. I know you're not a big sports fan. Neither am I. But if we can just pull through, it'll be over before you know it. Victor: I just wanted to focus on my science project. Is that too much to ask? Pen: Your dad just wants you to make more friends. Since ever,you've just been used to having Sparkles, Me and Ders around. Don't worry, you're not alone. I used to be solitary too, but after I became open minded, my perspective changed in a big way. I know you love Sparkles like a brother, but he's not going to be around your whole life. I'm just saying. Victor: I know. And that's what worries me. Anyway I gotta do some studying. See you Monday. Penryck: OK. Bye. Victor placed his phone on his bed as Sparky came over. Victor scratched his friend's head before getting up and walking to his desk. Opening a science textbook, he flipped through the pages until he stopped on a particular page: CHAPTER 8 Lightning and the effect of life around it. Victor: Until then, you'll always be here for me. Author Notes: I always thought the baseball scene should have a little more depth. Anyway, this is only chapter 1 of a 3 part story. Before i dismiss myself, here are a few notes; I decided to age up the characters a bit (to add a little bit of drama) and give them some background to diverse. Scott, Penryck and Ders are my O.C.'s. More will be coming soon. I translated the communication of animals to english, from their P.O.V. Weird Girl's name is Mara (in case you were wondering/asking). IDK what Year this story takes place in. so if you have any suggestions, feel free to pm me or leave a comment. And finally, like i said before, I don't own Any of the Canon. Thank you for your time.

I am sitting on the ground with my owner, Victor, close by. I am in an unusual place. Victor is sitting on a bench, sharing the bench with several other humans. Off of the bench in front of me, is a patch of orangeish/brown dirt with four white spots. One human is in the center of the patch of dirt. This human is throwing a ball to another human standing behind one of the white spots. For some reason, in between the human throwing the ball and the human catching the ball is a third human with a long stick that does not look like a natural tree branch. It looks synthetic, like it was shaped for a certain purpose. The human with the stick walks away from the white spot, handing the stick to Victor. Victor is the most important human to me right now. He likes to throw balls and other objects for me to catch. Maybe he will do that now. I would love it if he did. Chasing flying objects is what I was made for. The thrower throws the ball and Victor swings the stick towards it. The thrower throws the ball a second time, and Victor swings again. The thrower throws the ball a third time. Victor swings the stick a third time. CRACK! Victor has launched the ball into the air using his stick higher and faster than ever before! I instantly take off in its direction. I only get a few feet when I see the ball is now merely a dot in the sky. I keep running, and when I get past the patch of dirt, the ball is no longer in sight. But the ball has traveled in a perfectly straight line. I joyfully continue. If I keep going straight, I will find the ball. I have never failed to retrieve anything Victor has thrown to me, and I don't want to let Victor down now. I am now running across a hard gray surface. I hear the sound of an engine close by. But I filter it out. I need to keep moving. I must retrieve the ball Victor wants me to catch before something or someone else does. If I fail to do so, what will Victor think of me? I don't know and I don't want to find out. BOOM! I am hit in the side by something very hard and very heavy. I feel more pain than I have ever felt in my entire life-but it only lasts a fraction of a heartbeat. Suddenly, I am draped in a white blanket. Where am I?! Metal components have been inserted into my neck. I feel something round press against my back several times. I feel worthless right now. I was supposed to catch the ball Victor launched into the air with his stick, and I have failed. Victor must be so disappointed in me. Maybe Victor will tell me to go away and never return. If he does, I don't blame him. Then I hear Victor's voice say, \"Sorry, boy.\". Why is he saying sorry? He has not failed me. I have failed him. I patiently wait for Victor to pull back the blanket. The sooner he does so, the better. Pull back the blanket. See how I have let you down. Berate me, chastise me, do with me what you will. Get it over with. Victor lifts the blanket and tosses it aside. He joyfully proclaims, \"Sparky! I can't believe it! You're alive!\" I jump up and run around, trying to figure out where I am. I am in Victor's attic. I cannot understand what Victor is saying, or why Victor takes me up here so often, or why he does not even seem to notice that I failed to catch the ball that he launched skyward with his stick. But I can understand one thing-Victor has never been so happy. Victor is someone I can always trust, who will always be happy to see me. Even though I failed to catch the ball. I will always repay his loyalty with mine. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Frankenweenie belongs to The Walt Disney Company.

Summary: The kids are assigned a project to bring a fruit. Why that is, I have no clue. ((Cute Toshiaki x Nassor. Hints at Elsa x Victor and Edgar x Weird Girl)) A.N. I ship these two so hard they're too precious to live. \"This has got to be one of the most obscure assignments I've ever had to do.\" Victor said to his friend, Elsa. She giggled a bit and adjusted the awkward bag of apples in her arms. The two dark haired eleven-year-olds were heading to school carrying a bag of fruits each. There was a group project the class was starting today and it included bringing a fruit of their choice. Victor didn't really see the point yet, but Edgar seemed to like it. The hunchbacked boy had brought kiwis. He wasn't really supposd to bring them for the project, seeing as his mother had bought them for school lunches. However, she never said he couldn't bring them. Paired with Weird Girl, who had decided on bringing kumquats, Edgar thought the two would compliment each other well. The fruits that is, not each other of course. The mis-matched child shook his head, expelling those thoughts from his mind. The class sat waiting for the bell to ring. Most were talking and being loud as their teacher hadn't come yet. All of them were excited to begin the project, whatever it may be. One Japanese boy seemed quite nervous about something. He clutched the brown paper bag in front of him anxiously while swinging his short, chubby legs back and forth since his feet didn't touch the ground. However, when a tall Egyptian boy entered holding a matching paper bag to his, Toshiaki tensed, but quickly relaxed. \"Toshiaki,\" the tall boy said, \"there is no need to be nervous. You knew I was coming.\" Toshiaki narrowed his eyes as they exchanged bags. They had been adamant about getting each other fruits for their assignment. Neither of them really knew why, but when they both shared an idea, it didn't seem like a bad one. \"I wasn't nervous, jerk.\" Toshiaki retorted \"I just wanted to know what you brought me.\" The smaller boy opened the bag impatiently while the taller boy, Nassor, smirked a bit at Toshi's constant anxiousness. Duplicating his friend's actions, the Egyptian opened his bag the reveal the fruit selected for him. Starfruits. Interesting. He looked over at the Japanese boy, and was slightly surprised by his reaction to the fruit he had selected. Toshiaki's mouth had opened a bit at the fruit selection. It was two ripe dragon fruits. \"It's because I'm Japanese, isn't it.\" Toshiaki said heatedly, \"Racist! You got me dragons since I'm Asian!\" The smaller boy started trying to attack Nassor with his hands, to which the tall one simply extended his long arms to bring Toshi into a restricting embrace. \"Calm yourself Toshiaki\" he said in his deep voice, \"I got the dragon fruit because they reminded me of you. Not because you're Asian, but because they're unique, fiery, and spikey, but I know they're soft on the inside.\" He poked Toshi's fluffy cheek when he said the last part. Toshi squirmed. \"Ok,\" he said, blushing, \"Sorry I overreacted.\" The Asian began to redden even morse as he realized his position on Nassor's lap, in his arms. He looked up at the larger boy's, hesitated for a minute, then kissed nose. \"Thanks...\" he said, pausing before he continued, \"You're nice.\" \"You're cute.\" Nassor responded. \"Shut up!\" Nassor simply smiled at his tiny Asian's adorable temper.

Thursday, October 5th I lost my job today. I am no longer a teacher at New Holland Elementary. I wish I knew why I lost my job, but I don't. Today would be 100% bad news had it not been for one of my students. That student is Victor Frankenstein. He said goodbye to me as I loaded my personal things into the trunk of my car. We talked for a minute or two, and then I left. When you're a public school teacher, you meet a lot of different students over the years. There are angels and there are monsters, and there are all kinds of variations in between. There are slackers and there are overachievers. There are hardworking students who succeed, and there are hardworking students who fail because, sadly, their best is not good enough. But I never in my wildest dreams imagined that one of my students would have enough respect for me to say goodbye to me on my last day, when neither he nor I knew it would be my last day. I am so glad Victor surprised me as I left. It helped me see that my days at New Holland Elementary were not in vain. Monday, October 16th Today is the anniversary of Marie Antoinette's execution at the guillotine. If I could trade places with Marie Antoinette right now, I would. My life has no meaning or value. No one would miss me if I died right now. An uncertain future life can be scarier than a guaranteed death. I wonder if Victor or Elsa or any of my students would understand how I feel, but I sincerely hope they don't, not when they're so young. One thing's for sure-I do not want to work in Human Resources. In Human Resources, you have to fire people sometimes. I do not wish the misery I am going through right now on anyone. I have sent out job applications and cover letters to other schools. I have also sent out cover letters to some scientific companies in the area, hoping maybe I can get a job as a lab technician if I never get the chance to teach again. I have been very busy, but I have no way to know when or even if I will get a phone call from any of the schools or companies I contacted. At least when you have a job, you have clues as to whether you are succeeding or failing. When you're unemployed, it's like you're steering a boat in total darkness, with no landmarks or stars or compass. I am so glad I am single and alone right now. At least the only one suffering because I lost my job is me. Wednesday, October 25th If I was still teaching at New Holland Elementary, I would be evaluating the science fair projects of Victor Frankenstein, Elsa Van Helsing, and all the other students. But I'm not. So I'm stuck at home. I guess I'll never see what Victor's science fair project is. I've heard rumors that I've been replaced by a gym teacher. For some reason I feel Victor would not like that. I have not gotten any phone calls for job interviews. Maybe I'm not meant to teach. Maybe my reputation has been permanently tarnished. Maybe I will be unemployed forever and ever. Maybe I'll end up starving to death. If that's the case, maybe I should die now and get it over with. I don't want to waste space in a cemetery. I'll leave a note requesting that I be cremated and my ashes scattered. Save the cemetery space for people who have value, unlike me. Save the tombstones for people who deserve to be remembered. I spend my days at the library, reading newspapers in search of Help Wanted ads. Then I go home and write up letters to potential future employers, mailing those letters at the library's mailbox. I go to the library every single day now that I am unemployed. Dutch Day is coming up soon. I don't feel like going. I don't feel that I deserve to have any fun. I am doing everything I can think of to save money. When I go to the supermarket, I only buy solid food that doesn't need to be cooked or refrigerated. The only liquid I drink is water from the tap or drinking fountains. I can't remember the last time I used the stove or turned on the television or radio. All the electricity I use is for lighting the room when I type up cover letters. I still want to die, but I can't bring myself to do myself in. Not yet. I want to do something really kind to make up for my failure as a teacher before the blood in my veins runs out of momentum. I also want to fill out my income tax forms so somebody else doesn't have to. I wonder who will get my tax refunds when I die. Maybe I'll give what's left of my savings to a local hospital or the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army sounds more appealing to me. Whoever is ringing the bell will certainly get the surprise of his or her life when they see how much money I put in. Or I could also spend every last penny on Christmas gifts. Christmas is just two months away. I could buy a Christmas gift for all of my students. I could even mail them right now, with a note requesting that they open the gifts immediately. Unexpected rewards are better than expected rewards. My message to the world right now is this: Give me employment or give me death.

Victor pursued his scientific interests boldly, but tried not to go overboard. He built a paper airplane from three sheets of paper. The first sheet was the fuselage. The second and third sheets were wing extensions. The finished plane was 27 inches wide. Victor built the plane on his lunch break. But he did not launch it in the classroom. He placed it in his locker for the remainder of the school day. Finally, the school day ended. Time for a test flight. Victor punched a hole in the front of the plane, where the cockpit would be if the plane was real. He threaded a string through the hole, and tied the string to the rear fender of his bicycle. Then he took off. Victor was an experienced rider, and it did not take long for him to reach full speed. He kept pedaling until the airplane was roughly two stories off the ground. Then he cut the string. The plane soared upward for a second or two, then leveled off. It flew perfectly level for about six seconds, then it started to dive. That was the pattern the plane followed for he rest of the flight. It descended, but it descended smoothly and gracefully. That grace did not last long. Victor's airplane reached the end of its flight when it hit a mailbox. That was the bad news. The good news was that the plane was intact. And it covered more ground than it could ever cover in a classroom. Tomorrow, Victor would try the plane on a bike path through the forest where there were no trees or mailboxes. And he would use a longer string and pedal faster. Maybe one day Victor could make a paper airplane that would soar 100 feet into the air. But not today. Victor had to go home, finish his homework and eat dinner. The sooner summer vacation arrived, the better. The End. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Frankenweenie belongs to The Walt Disney Company.

This idea came to me about fifteen seconds after watching the movie the first time a few months ago but I put it off until now because I didn't think it would work out all that well. Bringing things back from the dead was risky business. In fact, after the whole deal with Dutch Day eight years previously, Victor Frankenstein had outright refused to bring anything back to life with his method. Occasionally he would charge his dog, Sparky, but for the most part he just left electricity alone. This vow had been strengthened by his last promise to his sick mother before she died, and when his father was killed in a car crash just a year earlier. When he was thirteen, Victor began to date his neighbor, classmate, and kindred spirit Elsa van Helsing. They had been brought together after he and Sparky saved her from the burning windmill, and later even more so when her poodle Persephone and Sparky began to show interest in one another. It seemed almost obvious that they would wind up together. And they did. Six years later, at the age of 19, they were still together, and Victor was considering how to propose so that they could go to college together 'the proper way.' Halloween night, it was storming violently outside. Wind slapped the house from all sides, rain pelting the windows so hard that the young couple was afraid they would fall through. The pair was relaxing on the couch, Elsa leaning into Victor, watching a black-and-white horror movie. \"I'm worried about Persephone.\" Elsa suddenly stated. The announcement was so unexpected that Victor took a moment to think up of how to reply. \"Is she sick?\" He asked, pressing pause on the movie to look at his girlfriend worriedly. \"Yeah. And she's getting up there in years . . .\" Victor knew exactly where she was getting with this and had to swallow down the lump that was forming in his throat. \"Els, you know I promised Mom and Dad that I wouldn't -\" \"I know, I know.\" Elsa sighed, returning to her previous position. Victor rubbed her arm, thinking, not even considering pressing play. Of course, he'd known that his lover's beloved poodle was fully mortal, and that when Death decided to rear his ugly head none were safe (besides maybe Sparky). But he'd promised. He couldn't just go back on a promise that important. Then his mind wandered to how Sparky would handle the death of his mate, and Victor's resolve weakened. He knew his dog would not want to live without Persephone. Maybe it was time to finally let the mutt go. \"You can press play now, Victor. I feel better.\" Except he didn't. The young science major sighed, turning the horror movie back on, but unable to concentrate on the monster that was shuffling its way across the screen. An Hour Later... Ring, ring, ring. Victor was startled out of his sleep by the ringing phone. He propped himself up on his elbows as he brought the small cellular to his ear. \"Hello?\" \"Victor?\" Oh, no, that tone of her voice... \"Elsa, what's wrong?!\" \"It's Persephone. I found her. She's...\" Elsa's voice faded, and Victor completely understood. \"Oh... want me to come over?\" \"Please. I know you made your promise, but please. Bring her back. It's not fair that you can have Sparky the rest of your life and I can't have my dog. Sparky would be happier with her too...\" Victor bit his lip through the entirety of her speech, feeling like he might cry himself. \"Sparky would be happier with Persephone, wouldn't he? And I know it's not fair. And I know you want her back. I can't fix one, but the other two...\" A pause on the other end. \"Oh, no, Victor, I didn't mean it like that...\" \"No. It would be better.\" He was already heaving himself out of bed and making his way up to the attic where Sparky slept. \"Victor. You can't put Sparky down.\" \"I'm not practicing euthanasia. I'm just cutting off his electricity. He's charging right now, so it shouldn't take too long.\" \"Don't! You shouldn't have to lose your dog just because I lost mine! You need him!\" \"He's not my only friend anymore.\" Victor bit back tears, finally realizing what he had been denying. \"I have you and Edgar.\" \"But you still need him! All the trouble you went through to have him back... does that mean nothing to you?\" \"Elsa. Calm down. I had to lose him eventually, didn't I? I have to learn how to let go.\" \"How are you so calm about this?\" I'm not. \"I don't know. I guess I have to be.\" He reluctantly powered down the device the loyal dog was hooked up to, making a run for his bedroom before he went back and turned it back on. Several beats of silence on the other end. \"Maybe we can bury them together.\" Victor returned to beneath his blankets, shaking. \"I bet they'd like that.\" \"Can we keep talking? I don't think I can sleep tonight.\" \"I don't think I can either.\" \"I love you, Vic.\" \"I love you too, Els.\" A Few Days Later... It was Wednesday when Sparky breathed his last, a fairly relieving yet devastating moment as Persephone was starting to be beyond the help of Elsa's perfume collection. A soft drizzle accompanied the gray morning as the young couple made their way up a hill in the pet cemetery, carrying their beloved dogs in the same shoebox between them. \"Here's to the cutest dog couple to ever walk this earth.\" Elsa mumbled as she helped her boyfriend set the shoebox in the hole Edgar had dug earlier that day. \"May they forever rest in peace.\" Victor added quietly. \"And forever rest together.\" The pale young man was a little startled when her soft hand joined his, as he wasn't expecting any affections today. She rested her head on his shoulder, obviously trying hard not to cry. The two held hands in silence, looking down in the hole at the blank box top before Victor picked up the nearby shovel and began to put the dirt back where it had come from. He was finally letting go. But at least he didn't have to do it alone. ","Summary":" Felt like taking a break from Gravity Falls stuffs to write out something Frankenweenie.

She always did this when she was nervous. She would juggle carefully, as if she were juggling grenades instead of balls. Of course, she was by her caravan. She knew it would only get her in trouble, but it was the only place she felt truly calm. Ever since she had come back home, she had become braver. Well, and she dazed off back into the 'alternate world' memories often, too. It had almost become a bad habit. She'd be thinking of her anti self, the sphinxes, Mrs. Bagwell and her odd ramblings, the gryphon, and of course, Valentine. Her drawings sometimes even consisted of the memories. She often wondered how the White Queen was doing, if the princess was behaving, and if the Dark Queen was well, staying…dark? Helena didn't know what to think of her. No matter what though, she couldn't shake the nervousness. The bloody nervousness wasn't because it was the opening night, oh no. That's what endless rehearsals were for. It was because her mind always liked to travel back to that night, the night the cancer finally took over her mum. Even though her father assured her the doctors had \"gotten all of it\", it still scared Helena. She always thought that maybe there would still be some left, somewhere. Well, that wasn't the only thing that was bothering her. Helena had heard two men in the troupe talking about a man walking around in a rectangular mask and who wore a long white robe, with tons of things stuffed in the pockets. He had asked everyone if they had seen or heard about a \"lost juggling associate, a close friend.\" Helena knew it had to be him, it just had to be. Valentine. Something bothered her, though. She was torn between believing it was all just a bloody dream, or that it had really happened. It all seemed impossible, but possible at the same time. \"That doesn't even make any sense...\" Helena mumbled to herself. Even her own thoughts were frustrating her now. \"Two minutes until show time, love!\" Her mum called to her. Helena jumped at this, and she missed a ball, which threw off her whole routine. She sighed and tossed the other two on the ground. It made her mind bounce back. \"Butterfingers!\" She had mused to Valentine. Of course he had to be the one to wake her up. He really was an important man. Helena snapped back to reality, cursing at herself for getting lost in daydreams again, and she ran as fast as she could towards the building. She couldn't be late on the opening show now could she? She burst through the back of the tent, gasping for breath. Her father had just announced the first act. \"I thought we had lost you there, dear!\" Helena's mum whispered to her as she caught up with her breath again. Helena smirked, and her mum tapped her on the nose. \"Hey bambino, think fast!\" Her father called to her. Helena glanced at him and her father tossed one of the torches to her. It wasn't lit yet, but she caught it flawlessly, and tossed it back with ease. Her dad winked at her, mouthed Good job and Helena smiled. \"Alright then, it's only a minute until our round! Places!\" Her mum called. Helena put a black and red mask on her face. The red half resembled violent, brilliant red and orange flames, while the black part looked like sooty ashes, as if a dragon was breathing on her mask. Helena walked up to the front of the opening and stood by her father, mother, and three other performers. Pingo, the mime, came over and nodded at Helena's dad, who handed him the torches. Pingo took all of the torches and lit them, handing them carefully back to Helena, her mum, and her dad. He did one of his odd clown hand movements, and Helena laughed. Helena was a bit nervous, and she sighed deeply. Her mother gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze as she was anxiously waiting for the cue. Helena closed her eyes, and thought back to the day the contractor had offered them a 'marvelous deal', as her father had called it. They now had a huge arena to perform their shows in, which could hold much more people, and meant bigger, more amazing performances. Well, it also meant that more people would want to join the circus, but Helena was glad that the family circus was doing well. A few of the people she trained had been total ditzes, but the rest were actually pretty talented, if Helena were to say so herself. They were even going to get animals in soon and possibly go all around Britain. Her thoughts were immediately cut off whenever the stage went pitch black. \"The dragons! They're here!\" One of the performers already on stage called. Her father whistled quietly, and rushed out of the tent, blowing flames at the audience, which resulted in several shrills. A loud roaring filled the auditorium, as if a large dragon really was there. Helena had secretly thought the whole effect was pretty amazing, but she'd never admit it. Joanee, her mum, ran out as her father growled at the other performers. Helena was up after that, and she exhaled deeply. Morris, her father, tapped her on the shoulder and gave her a reassuring smile. Helena smiled back, and rushed onto the stage, also 'breathing fire' at the audience. The whole room lit up in a second with brilliant orange and red flames that licked at the audience. More shrills echoed through the air. \"You dare mess with us Firebreathers, humans?\" Helena shouted at the performers without torches, while baring her teeth at them, like she was a dangerous lion. She crouched low and seemed to almost creep towards them, threateningly. \"Then I guess we'll have to devour you…bones and all.\" The gryphon flashed through Helena's mind for a split second as her dad said this, and all of them blew fire at the performers. They ran offstage with their clothes set aflame. (Even though it kinda made Helena sick, the other performers were protected by a special solution, which prevented them from getting burned.) Suddenly, three other performers dropped down from the ceiling, with marvelous wings attached to their harnesses. They were wearing dragon like masks, and had awful \"claws\" on their fingernails. The dragons swooped down, and swiped at the 'Firebreathers.' \"REAL dragons!\" Helena shouted, and they tried to run away. Her father drew a long sword, and pretended to 'slay' the dragons. The dragons shouted in pain, collapsed and sprawled out in pain. Fake blood squelched from their wounds. The effect seemed convincing enough, because the audience was going crazy at this point. Whenever they were all slain, everybody got up and bowed, and they all blew fire into the air, lighting the entire building in a marvelous rain of fire. The audience went insane, and all Helena could hear were shouts of joy and claps. She smiled, took a bow with the rest, and ran off towards backstage. She looked back for only a second. It made her freeze dead in her tracks. There he was, right in the front row. Valentine. … \"Love, you look like you're going to pass out!\" Her mum said to her as soon as she finally walked in. \"I…I'm fine mum. When does the show end?\" Helena's heart was racing, and she could barely think straight. How in the world had Valentine gotten back here? He certainly didn't do it whenever she left. No, that couldn't have been possible. Could it? It couldn't be. It had to be. She confused herself again. \"Are you listening, Helena? I said the show would be over in about ten minutes. What are you so worried about?\" Her mum almost looked concerned, as if Helena was going to keel over too. \"No, I just saw somebody I recognized in the crowd…\" Helena sat down, and her mum sat beside her, stroking her hair softly. She didn't mention much just because she didn't want her mum to think she was absolutely barking mad. \"It wasn't one of those…bullies, was it?\" Joanne carefully asked her daughter. Helena almost tensed up. Recently, there had been a group of kids that would tease Helena and bump into her while she would entertain the people waiting for tickets. They'd pick up her juggling balls just before the show started, and throw them far away, so Helena would have to scramble for them in order to make it to the stage in time. They'd also tease her and call her names. She usually just shrugged it off, but it had eventually gotten to her. One of the attendants tried to get them to stop and to go away, but the bullies only laughed and called him a freak. Although, they hadn't come back ever since the huge weight lifting performer had scared them off. He had cracked his knuckles loudly at them, and grabbed the leader boy, Logan, by his shirt. Helena stared in shock and a bit of a \"ha ha you-got-what-was-coming-to-you\" look. Logan looked basically sick, and the weight lifter, Louis, promised Logan that he'd smash his face in if he or any other of his rats bothered Helena again. After they had run off in fear, not daring to look back, Louis patted Helena on the head and gave her a friendly smile. \"Don't let 'em get to ya, mate! Follow yer dreams, and don't let anyone steer ya away from 'em.\" Louis told her before walking back into the stage. \"Helena, please…you're zoning out again. I don't like it when you do that…\" Joanne whispered to Helena, almost in a harsh voice. Helena blinked a couple times, and sighed. She really did hate this new habit. \"I'm sorry mum…and no, it wasn't one of the bullies. It was just a friend.\" \"Oh! A friend, you say? Well, go hang out with them after the show. It makes me happy whenever you talk about friends.\" Joanne told her with a smile. \"Well, would you look at that? The show's over. I'll tell your dad about what's going on. Go off and find your buddy, Helena. I don't want you to miss them!\" Her mum called to her as she ran over to help pack things away. Helena scrambled to get up, and she ran out of the complex. There were still tons of people mingling around, and some scrambling for their cars. Helena looked around desperately, searching for Valentine. There was only one thing on her mind, though. She had to know. It just didn't make any sense. How in the bloody hell did he get here…? _[Chapter 2] Helena managed to push her way through the crowd of people, and began to become annoyed at what seemed to be the growing swarm of people. Her eyes darted around frantically, her heart raced, and her mind wouldn't operate clearly. He wouldn't leave her bloody thoughts, and she almost hated it. It'd been almost four months since she'd last seen his face, and he was slipping away from her memory. She hated that too. Gathering up all the courage she could muster, she called out his name, practically pleading for a responce. \"Valentine!\" She called out. People looked at her for a few seconds, as if she had a few screws loose, and continued walking. Nothing. Zilch. No response. Please, please, please... She thought to herself. She felt the same way she did whenever the hospital had called her dad about her mum. Absolutely nervous, unable to think, and basically in tears. Helena decided that she officially hated Valentines now. He'd caused her all of this frenzy in her mind for nothing! He didn't even respond to her yet. Useless man! Helena began to almost get angry at herself for thinking that she would finally be able to see him again, to be able to juggle with him at least one more time, and for even letting him enter her thoughts. She had begun to practically storm back into the building. Well, she was until she heard somebody running towards her. She turned around in an instant, hoping to not get slammed into by a little kid. That never felt good. Her heart stopped. The voices of the crowds seemed to slip away, her thoughts were quelled, and her eyes watered up. He really was here. Physically there. She didn't have to believe in what seemed like fairy tales anymore. He smiled that fox smile of his at her. \"Helena...it really is you.\" He said, almost hysterical. He began to laugh out loud while Helena was practically crying of happiness. She wasn't even offended that he was laughing, for she knew it wasn't at her. The tears slid down her face quietly, and she began to laugh along with him. It was hard not to, since he was practically howling. Suddenly, he swooped her off of the ground and twirled her around, like a groom with his bride. Everything seemed to meld together, like it had whenever she placed the MirrorMask over her face. Helena could barely breathe, and she basically stumbled a bit whenever he finally set her down. They looked at each other, and Helena exhaled softly. Conversation almost seemed awkward. \"Valentine...I can't believe it's you.\" Helena finally managed to push out of herself. Why had she never felt like this before? She had thought of herself as fearless, independant, and courageous. Now she was jumpy, estactic, and more afraid than she had ever been in her entire life. \"Well, of course it is! There's no other man quite as handsome as I.\" Helena laughed at his narcissism, but she also found it cute. Something nagged at her mind, though. She had to know everything that had been going on. Maybe it would finally make her stop zoning out. \"I'm so happy to see you again, Valentine. I must ask about the...other world, though. What all has happened?\" He seemed to ponder the question for a moment, and he looked around. He stared at some of the people, who gave him odd looks and seemed to whisper about him. Valentine wasn't exactly...normal. He wore a mask, had a partly purple beard, a purple line running down his face, and a huge coat that practically dragged behind him. The circus show was over, but the rides were open for the night hours. Helena's family was even able to rent a few non-cheesy rides for after the shows, which Helena found to be pretty...well, awesome. Quite a few families stayed behind to ride the rides and have a good time, to Helena's surprise. The smell of carnival food was in the air, and Helena knew Valentine well enough that that's exactly what he wanted. Maybe food really was the pathway to a man's heart. Helena laughed to herself as she thought of this, and shook her head, almost angry at herself for getting all \"lovey dovey\". \"If you buy me a morsel of some of this amazing smelling food, I think I may be able to share some of my secrets.\" He flashed his fox smile again. \"Oh, fine Valentine. I don't even have to buy it, since I perform in the circus.\" She stuck her tongue out at him. \"That's completely fine with me. I want a...funnel cake. That sounds absolutely delightful.\" He ran off toward the vendor, and Helena chuckled, dashing after him. ... \"This is even better than that weird mask lady's cakes!\" Valentine was practically in heaven. He licked his fingers and swiped up some of the leftover sugar from the funnel cake. He licked that off of his fingers, too. Helena had to pry the plate form him so he wouldn't try and eat it. \"Anyway, you were going to share the \"secrets\" of the other world with me. That's the whole reason I got that funnel cake for you, you know,\" Helena said to him. He nodded and suggested they find a place to sit. A lonesome metal bench did the job. Valentine stroked his beard for a second and sighed. A lot really had happened after Helena had left, but it was worth the trouble to tell her. He knew she wasn't a dull girl, and that she'd listen to him. \"Alright. Well, first off, the White Queen woke up, obviously. The whole town practically threw a party, and they wanted to exile the Dark Queen and her wretched daughter. Whitey did not approve of this, and instead, they refined the borders between the Shadowlands and the Lightlands, and hired teachers and other people to help keep the princess under control. After the MirrorMask had shown up again, they placed it in a glass case within Whitey's quarters. It's protected by guards all the time. A real pain to get, if you ask me. Anyway, they erected a statue of you in the Lightlands. It's magnificent, really. They carved it out of our finest metals and scraps from abandoned buildings. They even painted it. It looks exactly like you...\" Valentine's voice dwindled away, and he wouldn't say anymore. That must be how he got here. He got the MirrorMask, somehow. Maybe he worked for the White queen, er well, \"Whitey\" as Valentine called her. A statue for me? I have to thank them somehow. Draw new buildings or something. Helena was lost in her thoughts again. Valentine snapped his fingers at her, and she immediately shot up, going a bit wide eyed and embarrassed that she let herself slip in front of Valentine. \"I'm sorry! I must've gotten lost in my big head again. So the Lightlands are doing well?\" Valentine nodded and stared up at the sky, and Helena looked up with him. It was a clear night, and every star seemed to be out. The moon seemed enormous and was practically shining down on them. It was...almost romantic. \"You have those twinkly things too, and a moon!\" He seemed almost astonished. \"The twinkly things are called stars here.\" Helena told him, trying not to offend him. He didn't seem to mind the comment. A cold breeze passed by, and Helena shivered. She was still in her leotard, which wasn't the best windbreaker. The wind wouldn't stop nagging at them, and she continued to shiver, holding her shoulders, and her teeth began to chatter. Valentine glanced at her, and noticed how cold she was. He felt awfully rude for not noticing it before. His heart skipped for a second. thmp thmp... He took off his coat and draped it softly over her shoulders. She pulled it close to her, as if it were a baby blanket. \"Thank you...\" She said softly, and she closed her eyes, sighing in relief. She hadn't realized how much the performance had tired her out, how much her thoughts tired her out, and how much Valentine had tired her out. Her head dropped suddenly, but she didn't wake up. She had already fallen asleep, and Valentine caught her just before she basically fell off the bench. His heart skipped again. thmp thmp... What exactly was this strange feeling he felt? It was...warm. Welcoming. It made his face turn a little hot and it made his chest get tight. Made the air almost hard to suck in. He'd never really felt anything like it, and he enjoyed it. It also scared him. It was enough to drive him insane, really. He picked her up carefully, but he didn't really know where to go. Suddenly, a woman that looked a bit like Helena ran up to him. \"Oh! Hello! You must be Helena's friend. I'm Joanne, her mum...oh. I see my little girl must've fallen asleep...where did she get that coat...? Thank you for talking to her, you see, she doesn't have very many friends. It makes me happy that she finally found one. I'll take her from you...\" Joanne carefully took Helena, holding her like she would a baby. Helena nuzzled into her mum's neck almost automatically. Joanne looked at Valentine, and back at Helena. She noticed that Helena had a very long coat draped over her. It seemed large enough to fit the young man. Joanne's face lit up, and she smiled at him. \"Thank you for giving her your jacket, erm...\" \"Valentine.\" He said with an awkward smile. \"Well then, thank you, Mr. Valentine.\" Joanne winked at Valentine. Before Valentine could say anything, she walked off back toward the building. Valentine scratched his head, and sighed. He almost didn't want to let go of Helena. He wanted to hold her forever. Er, well, at least until he got hungry again. Those cakes really were delicious. He shook the thoughts of food from his head. He'd waited for this day for what seemed like ages. Something bothered him though. How could Helena have no friends? She was kind, silly, and she could juggle well. Those were the perfect qualities of a friend in Valentine's book. It bothered him. She deserved to have friends. Well, he never had a friend before either. It actually felt really good to have somebody close. He never wanted to leave again. He wasn't going to. He didn't really care if it \"upset\" things in the other world. Although, he had become successful. Hundreds of people came to see his act, for he had gathered a miniature troupe and had performed for the townspeople. He always held his performances by Helena's statue, and he wouldn't do them anywhere else. He didn't know why, but he just felt...attracted to the place. As if it were made for him. Well, he was a very important man, after all. He stood there, and stared up at the sky again. A shooting star wizzed by, and Valentine automatically wished upon it, like his troupe member, Marcon, had told him. Marcon was obsessed with the stars, and he would blabber on about them. Valentine never really listened, for he'd be too distracted by food or by Helena. Well, he did feel a little bad for taking the MirrorMask without Whitey's permission, but he had to. He couldn't wait any longer. He knew she wouldn't be back since she didn't have the MirrorMask. He sighed, and rubbed his head. He'd been thinking too much and had given himself a headache. He walked off, but he realized that he didn't have anywhere to stay. He slapped his hand to his forehead, and ran towards the building that Joanne had walked off to. \"Hey! Is anybody in here?\" Valentine shouted at the building, expecting it to rise up. Helena's voice rang in his head. Buildings don't leave you where I come from. \"Oh! Mr. Valentine! Why are you here?\" It was Joanne again. She crossed her arms and looked at him. Her hair was down, and she was simply dressed in sleep pants and a long baggy sweatshirt. Valentine wrung his hands together nervously and sighed. \"I...don't really have anywhere to stay. I was wondering if I could stay here...?\" His voice dwindled away again, for he feared the answer. He hated asking favors ever since he had been kicked out of his mum's house. \"Why of course, Mr. Valentine. I'll set up a little bed for you. Helena's sleeping in here tonight, anyway. The whole family is. We have a lunch show tomorrow, anyway. If you'll hold on a second?\" Joanne ran back into the building, leaving Valentine alone with his thoughts. Before he knew it, Joanne came back and she ushered him into a room. They wished each other a good night, and she shut his door. It really was a huge building. Valentine imagined that it would have wings in the other world. It'd be a magnificent tower. He flopped onto the bed and sighed, pulling his mask off and examining it slightly. Even though he hated taking it off, he couldn't have it cracking, now could he? Valentine placed it on the floor next to him, and immediately fell asleep.[Chapter 3] Valentine roused himself from the clutches of sleep early the next morning, stretching his arms out wide and yawning. He smacked his lips a few times, and reached for his mask, putting it on carefully. He could hear Helena talking with somebody else. \"Alright, so you've got your eighteen groups of elements, right? Study them. Be sure to know how many valence electrons they have and all that. I know you have trouble with this, so I want to make sure you've got it down. I'll see you later, Helena.\" Helena thanked the woman and Valentine could hear her footsteps echoing down the hallway if he listened closely. He crept quietly out of the bed, practically tiptoeing outside. Helena was basically just out there, facing away from him and sitting at a table and chewing on a pencil. He crept up behind her and he heard her mumbling about electrons and all that with a notebook and a science book sprawled out in front of her. He never really liked science. Too many parts to it. If he were to describe it, he'd call it annoying and useless, just like sphinxes. He tapped Helena on the back, and she practically shot up into the air, even screaming a tiny bit. She turned around sharply, as if a mass murderer were behind her. \"Oh! Valentine…you scared the daylights out of me. Wait a second. Why are you here?\" \"Whoa, wait! Before you blow a gasket on me, your mum let me stay here. I had nowhere to go, and I wasn't about to go sleep in an ally. I'm an important man. Important men don't sleep in allies.\" Helena laughed at his remark, and it made him smile a tiny bit. He'd been hoping she would laugh. He glanced at her fingernails and noticed that they were still black from whenever she'd been…transformed. A small pang of guilt crept up on him for just a split second, but he shook it from his head. Onwards and upwards. She didn't seem too upset with him about it now anyway. She seemed almost skeptical, though. \"Are you sure…? Huh. Mum must've been all zoned out on her medication again…\" Helena sighed. Her mum had started taking meds so that she could successfully recover after she finally got out of the hospital, and so that pain wouldn't creep up on her during performances. They really didn't need another repeat of whenever the cancer struck. Helena blushed and started laughing. She knew what her mother would think. \"What? What's so funny?\" Valentine was almost appalled. Nobody had said a joke or anything, and there Helena was, howling like a crazy hyena. Tears were coming to her eyes. She brushed them away and glanced at him, smiling again. \"You know, my mum is going to think that we had sex or something.\" Valentine practically jumped away from Helena at this point as if she were a big black puddle of shadows. \"That's nasty!\" He practically shouted. \"I forgot how sick your mind was.\" He crossed his arms, appalled yet again that she would claim such a thing. Although, he did have to admit, it was kinda funny. \"Oops…speak of the devil…\" Helena muttered just as her mum walked in. She stared at Valentine for a second, and snapped her fingers. \"Oh! Mr. Valentine! Why in the world are you here?\" Helena mouthed 'I told you so' to Valentine. \"Wait! You invited me here. I told you I had nowhere to stay, remember?\" Valentine wrung his hands nervously again. Joanne glanced at Helena to Valentine and narrowed her eyes. \"If you did anything to my little girl, I swear…\" She looked as if she were about to stab Valentine in the throat. He didn't like that. He swallowed real hard. \"Mum, it's okay. I promise he didn't do anything to me.\" Joanne glanced at Helena and exhaled. She knew she could trust her daughter, but she eyed Valentine mysteriously. Suddenly, she gasped and went wide eyed. \"Wait a second! You're…that man! Oh, what was his name…oh! Thomas! He looks just like you!\" Valentine was appalled. A man that looked just like him? What in the hell was this? Thomas? What a bloody awful name Valentine thought to himself. He glanced at Helena, and she was biting her lip. She almost looked like she was going to cry. \"Thomas, why are you wearing that mask?\" Joanne was most utterly confused now, and a headache threatened at the back of her head. She tossed her hands into the air and walked out of the room. She went somewhere downstairs and Valentine could hear her feet echoing again. He crossed his arms. Helena got up suddenly and Valentine noticed that she was still in her pajamas. The ones he had first met her in. She grabbed him suddenly by his shirt and he gasped. \"Listen to me Valentine. Thomas is downstairs. My mum is probably talking to him now. If he comes up here and sees you, I can assure you that you'll be a very questioned and confused man. He's basically the anti you, just like how the anti me was destroying the world. I have a bad feeling about this. No matter what the cost, he cannot see you!\" She let go of him and placed her hands over her eyes. She exhaled deeply and looked around. Nobody was yelling or coming up the stairs. Maybe, just maybe…we might be in luck Helena thought to herself. Of course, Thomas walked in just as she thought that. \"What the…?\" Thomas was appalled. He practically fainted. Valentine did the same thing. They looked at each other in fear. Helena stayed close to Valentine and hatched a plan. She almost reached into her pocket to pull out the Very Useful book, but she stopped herself before she could. She smiled at Thomas, something she seldom did. \"Listen! Thomas, don't freak out! This is all part of a new act! We're doing doppelgangers of certain people. The only way we can tell the difference is by making them masks and accessories and using different outfits. So please understand. I know it's odd.\" She bit her lip tightly and she could taste blood. \"…well, alright then. I guess that's kinda cool. I'll see you around, Helena…\" Thomas walked off, rubbing his forehead and mumbling. Helena exhaled and thanked the gods that Thomas wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. \"Well, that went better than expected!\" Helena smiled. She was happy it worked. Nothing could really go wrong now. Suddenly, her ears rang sharply. It had been similar to the sound of whenever she had put the MirrorMask on. She collapsed to her knees and clenched her teeth tightly. Something was very very wrong. Pain raged inside her head, and Helena wanted to scream. Valentine knelt down and tried asking her what was wrong, but she couldn't hear anything. Voices overlapped each other in almost a haunting harmony. Everything turned to black and she felt herself hit the cold floor. Helena…Helena…Helena… Standing in front of her was the anti Helena. They looked each other in the eyes. Anti was in a beautiful dress, a choker around her neck, decorated with beautiful diamonds, long laced armbands that went up to her shoulders, and an elegant necklace touched her neck. Her hair was up high, like the Dark Queen's. Helena walked toward her anti self until she reached what seemed like a glass wall separating them. Helena put her hand to the glass. Her anti self exploded into thousands of tiny pieces as if she were glass itself. Helena screamed as this happened, and shielded herself from the pieces as she backed away instinctively. Her feet neared the edge of what seemed like a cliff, and she fell down into an abyss that never seemed to end. Darkness wrapped itself around her arms and her body, clutched at her, and pulled her deep into dark depths. She was drowning. She'd never felt so suffocated, so claustrophobic. Suddenly, Valentine was there. Helena reached up towards him, screaming. \"Help me, please!\" She screamed, practically sobbing. She was almost enveloped in the darkness now. Valentine smiled at her and exploded into thousands of tiny shards, just as the princess did. Except this time, his blood rained down on Helena. She didn't even have a chance to scream.[Chapter 4] Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what in the hell just happened, she's on the floor and there's blood coming out of her, oh my god, what do I do? Valentine paced back and forth, spewing curses under his breath. Why would she just randomly fall to the floor? If this is what her people thought was funny, it definitely wasn't funny to him, not at all. \"Ah, I know! I have to check and see if she's breathing!\" Valentine practically burst out loud. He kneeled down and stared at her until he saw her body heaving slightly. He exhaled and stood up again, stroking his beard in deep thought. What the hell am I going to do…? Valentine didn't really know what exactly he was planning, but he grabbed a knife from the drawer and planned to poke Helena's skin with it, in order to scare her awake. It seemed like a pretty good idea to him. He always woke up when somebody scared him. He pulls up her shirt a little, and pokes her with the tip of the knife. She immediately sits up and screams. Valentine screams back and drops the knife onto the floor. He can hear a pounding of feet coming up the stairs. Another scream echoes throughout the building. Valentine feels a fist colliding with his face, and it doesn't feel that great. \"Mum! What are you doing?\" Helena shouts. Joanne stares at Helena, sees the knife and the blood dripping from her daughter's nose and her mouth, and she slaps Valentine across the face. Valentine whimpers in pain and backs into a corner while Helena struggles to get up, her knees still weak from randomly passing out. \"Mum! Stop it! Valentine didn't do anything!\" Helena grabs onto her mum and tries to pull her away from Valentine. Joanne rips her arm away from Helena and grabs Helena's shoulders roughly, looking extremely angry. \"Helena! How can you say he didn't do anything? Explain the knife! Explain the blood on your face! I bet he tried to knock you out and rape you!\" Joanne shouts, tears streaming down her face. Helena didn't even notice the knife until now. She stared at Valentine, complete rage filling her mind at how stupid he could be sometimes. \"Mum, let me explain-\" Joanne slaps her daughter across the face and Helena stares at her in awe, shocked that her mother would ever do such a thing. Helena cries tears of rage and storms up to her room, slamming the door shut. Joanne stares at Valentine, eyes filled with scorn. \"Listen, you…I want you out of here right now. I don't care if you have nowhere to go, you don't deserve to be anywhere except for in hell!\" Valentine scrambles to get up and Joanne pushes him out of the door. \"Don't ever come back here. If I ever see your face again, I'll call the cops and you'll spend the rest of your sorry days in jail.\" Valentine winces at the sudden slam of the door and he walks off towards the main road. It's cold outside, and he realizes he doesn't even have his jacket. He doesn't care though. Nothing seems important anymore. I just lost the only person I love and I don't have anywhere to go. No warmth, no food, no other human beings. Why must I be so stupid sometimes? Valentine hangs his head down and follows where the speeding monsters are going, since they all seem to be flocking somewhere. He doesn't care where he ends up anymore. \"I'd rather be dead…\" Valentine mutters to himself as he feels cold tears streaming down his face. He falls to his knees and starts sobbing, regretting ever coming to Helena's world. ... \"I don't care, mum! You wouldn't listen to me and you forced my only friend away from me! I hate you! I don't want to see you ever again!\" Helena pushes her mother out of her room and slams the door shut, locking it tight. She ignores her mum's pounds at her door and the shouts of her name. Helena rips one of her old drawings off of her wall and tears it into pieces, throwing it onto the ground and stomping on it as hard as she can. She grabs whatever she can and throws it across the room in rage, even breaking one of her favorite CDs. She doesn't care though, until a few minutes later, and she regrets acting upon her feelings of hatred. Helena stares at herself in the mirror and looks at the dried blood that had run down her face and had pooled up on her chin. Helena suddenly smashes the mirror, and the face staring back at her cracks in half. Helena sees herself on the one side, and her Anti self laughing on the other. It's a wicked laugh that echoes in Helena's brain and won't leave her alone. \"Stop it!\" Helena screams, and she claps her hands to her ears, closing her eyes and shaking her head. When she opens them up again, her anti self has faded from the mirror, and Helena hits herself in the temples as hard as she can, trying not to cry from the sudden pain. \"You stupid, stupid girl…stop imagining these stupid things…\" Helena mutters to herself. She sees a piece of the mirror on the floor and picks it up, pricking her finger with it. She watches the blood slide down her finger, and presses the piece of mirror slightly to her wrist. She immediately tosses it away, shaking her head. There's no way I could ever do…that… Helena thinks to herself. Helena scratches the blood off of her face, its strong scent filling the air. She collapses onto her bed and curls up as tightly as she can. She notices Valentine's coat hanging off of the edge of her bed, and she pulls it off, staring at it. She carefully wraps it around her body. Helena can smell faint traces of funnel cake, and she starts to cry softly, missing the masked man already. She wraps it tighter against herself, but hears the soft sound of crinkling paper. She pulls it off slowly and searches his pockets, pulling out a dead rose and a crumpled piece of paper. She unfolds it, and gasps. It's a love letter. Dear Helena, I've wanted to tell you for a long time ever since you left this world that I've had these strange feelings. The only occur when I think about you, but I don't know what they are. I want to talk to you about them, but I don't know…I think I- Helena struggles to read the rest, since it's covered in black ink, but there is a small legible bit at the bottom. I've never felt this way about anything or anyone else. A part of me hopes you feel the same. Sincerely, Your friend, With love, Valentine This isn't just a love letter… Helena thought to herself. \"…it's a love letter to me.\" Helena says slowly, as if she's going to fall apart if she says it any louder. She stops breathing for just a second. Nobody has ever said they loved me before besides my parents. I don't even know if I love him. Can I love anybody? What exactly is love? I…I don't know… Thoughts bombard Helena's head, like a fleet of bullets. \"I want to love him back, but how? How do I love somebody? Is it just an expression? I…\" Helena shuts up and starts crying again. She hates being confused, and she hates not knowing the answer even worse. She wishes she could consult the Very Useful book, but- Wait. She can. There's one page left. Helena jumps out of the bed and ransacks her drawers until she finds it. It's a bit beat up, and she can barely read the cover anymore. Her thumb rests on the edge of the book and she carefully opens it up. She stares at the page, dumbfounded. Of course, it was so obvious. ... Valentine stares through a restaurant window, the smell of food tainting his thoughts. He carefully opens the door, and hears a bell jingle. The shop is very busy, and it's filled with people. He stares at the food by the window, and he's very tempted. Instinctively, he tries to search his pockets, but he remembers leaving his coat at home. He's starving; it's been hours since he last ate. He can barely go thirty minutes without eating something small. His heart beats fast, and he slowly edges towards the window, making sure nobody is paying too much attention to him. He knows he shouldn't be doing this, hell, he shouldn't even be thinking it, but he's so desperate. Without thinking, he snatches a cake and runs out of the shop, running as fast as he can down the street. \"THIEF!\" He hears footsteps thudding behind him, and he runs as fast as he can. He turns down an alley, trying to lose the men, when he suddenly rams into a big burly man. The cake smashes all over the man, and the man punches Valentine in the gut. Valentine's eyes go wide, and he tastes a bit of blood in his mouth as he collapses to the ground. He groans in pain and he hears hate filled voices around him. \"That's him! That's the man who stole one of my cakes,\" cries a woman. Valentine feels his hands being chained together and two men pick him up. They drag him to a roaring monster and shove him into the back of it. Valentine tries to struggle away, but they slam the door before he can escape. \"I'm getting' real sick of just arresting hoodlums, Jim. I want real action, not some deadbeat trying to steal a god damned cake…\" one of them growls as they settle into the second seat. The driver gets in, laughing, and nods. \"I know what you mean Ed, but it can't be helped. We have a duty, to stop crime. No matter how big or small, it's our job bud.\" Valentine feels himself passing out from the pain of getting punched in the stomach. Everything turns to blackness and the voices in the car fade. ... When Valentine awakens again, he sees himself trapped behind bars. He grabs them and starts rattling them as fast as he can. \"Help! Somebody please! I'm trapped! Help,\" Valentine shouts as loud as he can. A fat man practically waddles up to the cell and slams a stick against Valentine's fingers, which causes him to shout in pain. \"You better knock it off boy, or next time I'll smack ya over the head until you bleed!\" The fat man walks away and Valentine slumps down onto the uncomfortable bed, trying to forget about his fingers going numb. The moon is shining through a barred window, and Valentine can slightly see how dirty the place is. It disgusts him, and he pulls a thin blanket over himself, trying to sleep, thinking that this is all a dream and that he'll be back in his own world, performing for crowds and having fun, laughing his worries away. Deep down though, he knows this is all reality and he can't escape from his problems this time. ","Summary":" Helena was nervous, very nervous. She always did this when she was nervous. She would juggle carefu"},{"Movie":"Frankenweenie","Title":"Into The Doghouse","Author":"Lord Candycane","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10476343","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Sparky I was running as fast as my little legs could take. The giant wooden dog house with the large fan was in front of me. And behind my, was an amass of two-leggers carrying fire. The big fat two-legger was leading them. I didn't like him. Neither did my master. My master was in there. So was the cat-like creature with the giant wings. I hesitated. Then I remember that my love is in there as well So I surge forward. The giant doghouse is in front of me now. I turn back and try to warn the two-leggers of the danger. But instead, I feel a rope tighten around my neck. A tall two-legger has me on a leash, and it hurts. The big fat two-legger tells something at me, but I don't listen. Suddenly, the giant doghouse is on fire. The fat two-legger has set it on fire. How stupid of him. Now my master and my love are trapped inside. They will surely not make it out. I yelp in fear, and suddenly, I break the lease around my neck. And I race inside. I don't care that there is fire around me. I don't care that I may die. What I do care about is getting my master to safety. Before I know it, I'm at the top of the doghouse. And I see my master, and, on top of him, the cat monster. I have to do something. The cat creature is about to strike. So I run over and bite the cat creature on the arm. The creature hisses and flies up into the air, taking me with it. He sets me on one of the fans, but I keep a hold on his arm. He pulls back, and I struggle to restrain him. Finally, my grip loosens and he frees himself and flies to the top of the fan. I race after him. I have to keep him away from my owner. The cat creature turns around and tries to swipe at me. He misses and I bark at him, trying to intimidate him. He flies into the air and lunges, trying to knock me over. He nicks my nose, and I yelp, but I strike back, biting him. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see my master bring my love and her owner to safety. Now I re-focus on the cat creature that lunges once more. He misses, and I bark. He grabs me, and I bite him. He flies off and I snarl at him. At that point, I slip and start sliding to my master. He catches me. However, I hear a hiss and I see the cat creature flying towards us. He knocks my master over and the two drop back into the doghouse. I yelp once more in horror. The doghouse is burning fast, and I need to get down there quickly to save my master. I race back inside and down the steps. I dodge the sizzling fire that burnt through the doghouse quickly. I have to find my master. There he is. He is lying next to the cat creature. They are both knocked out. Quickly, I take my owner and drag him out of harm's way. Soon, we are both outside and out of danger. The two-leggers and my love are there. They clasp their hands together, I think to mean that they are happy I'm happy to. My owner finally awakens and smiles, relieved. I hop around, glad that everything is over. And then I feel a pain in my tail. Something is pulling me back into the burning doghouse. The entrance is blocked by fire. I am released and turn to see what has pulled me back inside. It is the cat creature. I bark at it, once more trying to intimidate it. It swings its arm at me and misses. I run forward. If I can get a good bite in, he'll be too distracted or injured while I get away. Instead, I get struck across the snout, and I fly into the wall. The cat creature is stronger than I believed. I look up fearfully as the cat creature flies forward. I bark in a last ditch attempt to scare him off, but he continues forward. I back up as he spreads his wings, revealing his full size and wingspan. Just as he is inches away from me, the creature stops and shrieks. I then see a wooden stick has run him through. It's a grizzly sight. The cat creature hangs his head low and gives one final breath as its life leaves him, but my relief gets cut short as the doghouse collapses. There is no escaping. I am crushed down by the full weight of it. And then, darkness.[Chapter 2] Mr. Whiskers Hatred. Hatred and agony. That was what I was feeling. In my arms, a puffy black dog was struggling in my iron grip as I flew to the giant wooden doghouse. I didn't even know why I chose there of all places. I had to get somewhere. The moment I burst through the giant door and dropped the dog on the ground, I lunged, ready to tear her throat out. I despised dogs. Especially her and that white chubby dog that lived around the corner. \"No!\" I pause for a moment, hearing the voice. At that moment, a small two-legger with black hair takes the dog in her arms. I stair at her. She looks nothing like the girl I knew so well. She looks the exact opposite. She isn't my owner. I hate her, too. I land on all fours and start following her as she starts to run up the steps, still clutching the black dog. The dog barks at me, but I continue on. I will kill both of them. \"Stay away from us!\" The girl shouts, but I continue after her. Soon we are at the top of the stairs. And then, we are all on the balcony of the doghouse. I spread my large wings and take off after her, striking her head. The two-legger loses her balance and falls, clutching to the edge of the roof for dear life. By now, a whole mob of two-leggers are at the bottom of the doghouse. One of them sets it on fire. I hate them. I will kill them all. I see a little two-legger pass through the window and towards the girl and the dog. He is trying to save them. I will not allow it. I fly up to him and knock him over. Pinning him down, I start clawing and biting. Then I feel a pain in my arm. It is the white dog I despise so much. He is here to protect his master, it appears. I fly up to the large wooden fans with him still gripping my arm. I pry my arm free and take flight with the dog running up after him. The fool. Once he is standing on the windmill with limited balance he will stand no chance. I lunge at him several, missing. At one point I manage to grab him, but he bites me and I let go. We hiss and bark at each other until the white dog inevitably loses balance and slides down the fan. The little two-legger grabs him. I am so angry. I fly down to them, ready to kill them both. However, I only manage to grab the two-legged boy. We fall, and I let go, ready for him to fall to his death. Then I will go after the dog. But he grabs my arm. I panic. We both crash into the doghouse. I am dazed, and I lose consciousness. I soon awaken, and I see that the little two-legger and the dog are gone. I glance outside and see they are both outside with the mob. I could escape so easily. But the sight of that dog increases my fury tenfold. I fly back out and grab his tail, dragging him back inside so we can continue are battle. He barks at me and I swipe at him. He charges, but I'm ready for him. Striking him across the snout, I send him tumbling into a wall. He cowers against the wall as I approach. Now I am the one in charge. I hiss slowly as I approach, savouring his fear. I will kill him slowly, painfully. I forget that the doghouse is on fire and will soon collapse. All I want is that dog dead. I spread my wings and prepare to engulf him, but just at that moment, I feel a stabbing pain in my back. It pierces my chest. I screech in agony. And then, darkness. ","Summary":" Sparky I was running as fast as my little legs could take. The giant wooden dog house with the larg"},{"Movie":"Frankenweenie","Title":"Dark Little Flower","Author":"Maddening Dreams","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10880031","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I sat in the front seat of my father's car with my hands on my lap, my back straight and my head held high with a stern glare right on my face. My father had the same expression on his face grasping the steering wheel ever so tightly his jaw clenched. The air was tense filled with anger and confusion from me. I looked over at my father and gave a small sigh letting my shoulders fall and my head slightly drooping. \"I still don't understand why I have to leave…\" My father gave a small frustrated sigh but giving a small sad frown. \"No school wanted to take you in dear. Kept saying your record is very well known for your… \"creative arts\". So you will be living with aunt and uncle to go to New Holland High till I can find a school that will take you in. Don't worry, you have your cousin Victor. Do you remember him dear?\" I gave a small shrug. Its been a many years since I have even seen my beloved cousin. I gave a small smile though, I still call him when given the chance, telling me his crazy adventure with Sparky and the other undead pets. \"Yeah, we still talk.\" \"Good, maybe he can help you make some new friends and make you right at home. Won't that be nice?\" \"Yeah I guess… it would be nice to have friends…\" My father glanced at me at the corner of his eye and gave a small smile. I smiled back but drop my gaze back at my hands \"And if you behave you may get a new kitten.\" My head shot up in surprise. I once had a cat who been with me been since birth but she died when I turned thirteen, now sixteen almost seventeen old Junior in highschool still no pet. Which theres not much to complain its hard to get a new pet when you are practically raised with a loyal pet at your side since birth. But since I started high school again I'm basically a loner with people always picking on me, I wouldn't mind a new companion. \"Really?\" I asked softly. \"As long as you behave yourself young lady. If you can stay in the school for at least a full semester with no calls from the principal, teachers or you aunt and uncle then yes you may have a new pet. Deal?\" \"Deal.\" I replied with no hesitation. Father nod as well not taking his eyes off the road. I just hope my life in my new home is better than my last. ~New Holland~ \"Dear is the guest room ready for Iris?\" Susan Frankenstein asked her husband Ben Frankenstein. \"Yep, everything is prepared for when she arrives. I can't believe it's been ten years since we've seen her. I wonder how much has changed.\" Ben said with a thoughtful look. \"We'll see when she gets here dear. Victor was so excited to hear that she was coming, I'm so glad that he still talks to her even after all these years. Your brother said that Lavender has been ignoring her own sister! That just so sad.\" Susan said with a small frown. Ben wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulder and gave a small frown as well. \"They have been having their ups and downs for years dear. From what Lewis said Lavender only cares about social life instead of her own sister. Heck Lavender went far enough saying she has no sister all.\" Susan gave a small gasp. \"Then why doesn't he send Lavender here instead? Maybe we can straighten her out.\" \"That's what I said. But Lewis said that Iris couldn't get into any school since her… little incident from last year happen. So he saw it fit better for Iris to come here instead. Hoping a new environment might do her some good too, maybe even open her up a little bit make some friends. Don't worry he said he will deal with Lavender when he returns home.\" Susan and Ben said nothing else but stared at the comfortable guest room that will used by their niece. They had cleaned it out wanting Iris to place her own nicknacks inside to make her feel right home hopefully. Victor had even helped out by placing out some gifts he always wanted to give her but never given the chance (or had the money to do it). Most of the gifts are paintings of ballerinas in dark forest either dancing around or giving a certain pose. Others were either paintings of Norse, Egyptian, Greek or Roman Gods. There is even a little book shelf on the side of the wall filled with horror, science fiction, syfy, drama and mystery genre of books. Lewis Frankenstein said they will bring some things that Iris wanted to bring so she she has something to do if she had the free time. They had agreed to it wondering what their niece will bring. \"Is the guest room ready?\" A slight deep voice asked. The couple turned and smiled at their son, Victor. Victor didn't really change much the only thing that really change was his height. He wore a loose button of shirt and a pair of black pants. Right beside him was Sparky looking rather old but happily wagging his stitched tail. \"Yep and Iris should be here any minute. Are you excited to see her again?\" Victor gave a small smile. \"Yeah. I sometimes forget we're cousins. Feels like we're siblings or best friends since we get each other.\" Sparky gave a bark at Victor making him chuckle. \"Other than you Sparks.\" Sparky gave a happy bark. The family gave a small laugh enjoying the moment they were having. `*Knock* Knock* The family perked at this with Sparky barking and running in circles. \"I got it!\" Victor said happily. Victor ran out of the hallway to the door with his mother giggling and his father shaking his head with a smile on his face. When Victor hit the last step of the staircase step he fixed his hair and shirt trying to look presentable to his uncle and cousin. When he got near the door he open it to see a man that looked exactly identical like his father but with a five o'clock shadow some silver going in his slick black hair from age. The man smiled at seeing Victor and his eyes wide with surprise. \"Victor?\" Victor can only smile at his Uncle Lewis with a small nod. Lewis gave a small laugh and open his arms embracing his nephew. \"Oh you have grown so much since the last time I saw you!\" Lewis pulled back seeing that Victor was giving small smile. \"It's good to see you too Uncle Lewis. How are you?\" \"So far alright so far my boy. How have you been?\" \"I've been good.\" \"Hello Lewis.\" Both Victor and Lewis turn to see Ben and Susan with warm smiles on their faces as well. \"Well isn't it my brother and his lovely wife how are you two?\" \"We're just fine Lewis. Now wheres my favorite niece at?\" Susan asked with excitement in her voice looking over her brother-in-law's body. Lewis couldn't help but chuckle slightly happy to see that his brother's family is excited to have Iris in their home. \"She fell asleep in the car. I didn't have the heart to wake her just yet…\" Lewis looked over to see his daughter's head leaning on the window sleeping ever so peacefully. A hand grasped his shoulder giving a small squeeze, Lewis glanced at the hand and to see who it was connected to. Only to see Victor give a warm smile. \"Don't worry Uncle. We'll take care of her, some of my friends are excited to see her. I'll try to help her in anyway possible.\" Lewis looked back to his daughter and sighed. \"I know you will be there for her my boy. I just worry for her.\" Lewis walked away from his nephew to wake his young daughter up. When he got near the door he looked at his daughter once more time. She has long blood red hair that went down to her bum making her pale skin even more pale and her hair even more red. Her round face flawless yet so tired looking with slight bags under her narrowed eyes. She was slightly thin with a pear shape body, not a sick or stress thin but a healthy thin. Lewis couldn't help but chuckle at his daughter's choice of clothing. She wore a long sleeve shirt, the toros part being black and purple stripes while the sleeves being purple that had been rolled up to her shirt tucked in black waist shorts with black suspenders on. She wore purple tights with black wide fit lace up wedge shoes, or whatever his daughter called it. On her hands she wore fingerless gloves with silver rings around her fingers. He shook his head and lightly tapped the glass to wake her. Iris gave a small groan but looked up and blinked several times glancing around noticing she was in the car and no one in the drivers seat. Looking up at the window her father looked down at her with a small smile. He looked at hers eyes, her beautiful blue eyes the reason why they named her Iris in the first place. She glanced around for another second and realize they were at her cousins home. Her father stepped away from the door as she plunged it right open forgetting she was wearing a seatbelt she tried to get out of the car only to be forced back in. \"You forgot your seatbelt, dear.\" Lewis said with a smirk. Her daughter gave a small cough and tried her best not to give her father the finger. \"No? Really? I haven't notice.\" Iris said rather sarcastically. Her father chuckled and helped out of the car removing the seat belt first. As she finally got out of the car she was grabbed in a tight loving hug by her aunt. \"Oh my lord! Iris you have grown so beautiful! And you grew out your hair! Oh my you look so much like your mother.\" Iris blinked several times in slight shock of what just happen. She soon smiled ever so softly and embrace her aunt as well. \"Hello Aunty Susan. I'm alright thank you. And you?\" \"Oh well enough. Just excited to have another girl in the house.\" Susan replied with much joy in her tone. Iris just gave a small chuckle at this. \"Well isn't it lil Iris. How about a hug for Uncle Ben?\" She turned around to see her father's twin. Rolling her eyes she hug the man as well. \"Hello to you too Uncle Ben. How are you?\" She asked as she pulled back from the embrace \"I'm well dear. And you?\" \"I've been okay.\" Ben gave nod, but knowingly she was giving half the truth to him but let it go knowing his niece hasn't been her best. \"Can I get a hug from my favorite cousin?\" Iris' eyes widen in surprise by the sound of the voice. Whipping her head around she notice Victor. Without a second thought she practically threw herself at him wrapping her arms around his neck, without realizing she even threw her own weight on him in surprise he fell backwards. \"Ow… hello to you too Iris.\" Victor said with a wince. Iris didn't say anything, only wincing herself she used her hand to protect Victors head from the driveway. \"Hey… okay not one of my best ideas in the world.\" Iris hissed out slowly removing herself from her cousin and rolled over in her back. Without a warning Sparky decided to join in on the family welcoming giving slobbery kisses all over her face. The young teen gave a small giggle. \"Sparky! I miss you too sweetie but please stop licking my face!\" Iris sat up looking at Sparky. She gave a warm smile but soon dropped when she got a better look at the dog. Lewis starred eye wide of Sparky in shock. He had heard the tale from his brother and daughter what happen to the poor dog but seeing for real was a bit of a shocker. The family held their breath wondering how the relative would react. \"You know, when you said you brought Sparky back I didn't think you made him looking like a stuff animal dog with so many patches.\" Iris said rather bluntly getting a good look at Sparky with curious eyes. Lewis moved forward to get a better look at the old dog as well. Sparky gave bark getting some attention. Lewis couldn't help but chuckle. \"Can't help but agree with you dear. But it still Sparky.\" Lewis said with a smile. Victor let out his breath that he had been holding in since Sparky appeared. Even though he told his cousin he really didn't know how she would react to it in person. Lewis and Iris didn't find it frighten or disturbing at all, they would have wanted to do the same as well if there love ones had passed away. Lavender is another story though, she would have freaked out and would have said so many unkindly things about it. Victor stood up from the ground and helped Iris up to her feet as well making Sparky fall from her lap. She brushed herself off making sure no dirt was shown on her black shorts. Glancing around finally she got a good view around the neighborhood. Everything looked rather nice, green lawns, rose bushes almost on every lawn, well except for the one next door only to have more various flowers and bushes. Everything look rather friendly, almost 1950 styles in New Holland. She couldn't help but smile seeing how she like old and new things in life, being in a new home might not be so bad after all. \"Is there anything you need to bring in the house dear?\" Susan asked after some time of silence. Iris gave a small nod and went to the car and opening the trunk. In the back was some boxes of clothes, books, 3 different guitar cases, a banjo case, some records, a big 80's stereo and a record player. Grabbing the boxes first she placed them on the sidewalk then her beloved beatbox, record player and guitars. She could tell her her aunt and uncle were rather surprised by this, having such older music unlike most teens they would just be carrying a Ipod of a sort to hold their music. Iris is one of those teens but rather like old fashion as well. \"Now where on earth did you get a stereo at?\" Susan ask as she bent down to grab one of the boxes. \"One of my friends families has a whole collection of these things. He gave me one for my birthday because he knows how much I love these things.\" Iris said easily with sad smile. \"You know Jason still wants to talk to you. So does Mia and Jax.\" Lewis said softly to his daughter. Iris gave a small nod. Victor stared at his cousin, remembering those three name are some of the closest friends she has. But three? She had a little bit more friends from what he could remember. He let it go when he notice she looked rather sad of hearing the names. Victor picked up the boxes filled with clothes knowing his cousin won't anyone near her \"precious babies\". \"I'll show you to your room if you like.\" Victor said with a small grin. Iris glanced up holding her stereo in her hands, glancing over at her father trying to see if it was okay. If it was really happening. Lewis gave a small nod to the house with a look with much pain to see his daughter leaving him. Iris gave a small nod and walked over to Victor and followed him in the house. No, her new home. Authors Note: Hello! My first Frankenweenie fanfic! I really love Tim Burton movies and this one was cute not to do a fanfic on! I really don't know how you guys will feel about an OC being in Frankenweenie but I read Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and saw that Victor had a cousin and that they were close (I am not doing incest people just no) and I just thought this story up. I might not work on this much because I am currently working on another fanfic How to train your Mage on HTTYD. So that has my most attention right now but I have had this on my computer for a while now and well I'm just going to post this if you guys like it great I will work on it a bit more. If you don't well okay. Review and Fave.[Chapter 2] Rated T for Iris's swearing. It took a few hours but Iris was now settled in. Lewis had helped her unpack but after an hour he left with much sorrow to leave his youngest daughter behind. Iris didn't say much more after he left she stayed in her room just looking around feeling nothing but nervousness for the next few weeks to come. Just thinking about going to a new school with people she had never met slightly frighten her but also relieved knowing no one knows her. Its rather confusing but she didn't bother much of it. \"Seems like someone is thinking rather hard.\" A soft said breaking out from her trance. Iris gave a small chuckle. \"Yeah… its just so… odd I guess. Living in a new home that not in a city without my dad and sister… It just feels…\" Iris trailed off not knowing what to say to her cousin. Victor gazed at her, with a small sad smile. \"It might be better here. The place is quite, way to quite I might say. Not much has happen since the whole bringing the dead to life and all. Maybe you can change that.\" Iris gave a small smirk at thought of bring hell into the quiet town but shook her head. \"Sorry Victor, promise my dad I'll behave while I'm here. Besides I think your neighbor is already suspicious of me.\" Victor chuckled, she was right earlier Burgermeister and Elsa had come over to see what all the \"ruckus\" was all about. They had met Iris who didn't really know how to react to them. Elsa seem pretty nice and all but her uncle… Iris can already tell that he didn't like her. Victor sat on his cousin bed and gave a small grin at her. \"Yeah, that's the Mayor of the town. He wants to know everything going on to make sure everything is… perfect I guess.\" Iris shook her head at this. \"So seeing a china doll with blood red hair going to ruin that certain perfection?\" Iris asked with a grin. Victor gave a laugh. \"You? A china doll? If anything you would punch someone for even calling you that.\" Iris laughed as well knowing that is true. Leaning against her cousin she still had her grin on pale pink lips. They both sat there in silence, it wasn't awkward or uncomfortable. It felt relaxing. \"Are you excited for school tomorrow?\" Victor asked softly. Iris gave a small shrug. \"I don't know what to feel Victor. I feel happy that no one knows of me but also nervous what people will think of me or just avoid me because… my little hobbies.\" \"Hey, your hobbies aren't a bother here. People might surprise you, besides there a bunch of us that does a different thing. Heck I brought my dog back to life, so your hobby might not even be a bother to anyone.\" Iris looked up at her cousin looking him the eye to see if he was speaking the truth. Seeing he was sincere she smiled. \"Yeah, maybe you're right. I'm just nervous is all. Soooo what are the kids like? Any female dogs or butt heads I should worry about?\" Victor just shook his head at his cousins choice of words. Victor knows that his cousin has colorful language that can make even a sailor blush but since she is in a home with an aunt who really hates cursing and an uncle who will hit you with a newspaper for saying such words. \"Well… To be honest I have no clue. The only people who I usually see and hang out are Elsa, Edgar, Toshiaki, Bob, Weird girl and Nassor.\" Victor listed out the names of kids who joined him bring the dead back to life, well minus Elsa (who was only singing at the time when everything went to hell) and Bob who only made sea monkey be huge and vicious little monsters. Iris just gave a small nod at the name thinking on what to do. \"Who do you mostly hang out with?\" Iris asked looking up at her cousin. \"Elsa and Edgar.\" Victor answered. Iris looked at her cousin in shock. She may not ask about his friendships with people because they way he spoke of the other names on the phone she simply assumed that they are all friends only to be proven wrong. \"May ask why not hang out with the others?\" \"Toshiaski and I can get along at time but he is very competitive and likes to beat me at what he calls \"my own game\". It just gets annoying to be honest.\" Victor said sheepishly. Iris merely shrug wanting him to continue. \"Bob… he's a nice you might get along with him. He's agreeable to everything so its hard to keep a conversation in a debate of certain things. He's nice but you know I get when I'm in a conversation so I don't really hang out with him much. But I do help him a lot with his studies so I guess you can say we are good acceptance.\" \"Soo he's a sweetie that gets mostly B's and C's in class mostly into fun and not really in brainy kinda stuff like you?\" Iris asked. Victor chuckled how easily his cousin can pick stuff up. \"Yep that pretty much sums it up. Okay um WeirdGirl.\" \"Doesn't the poor dear have an actual name Victor? That nickname seems rather rude and impolite.\" \"Sorry… its been stuck to her for years when she still had…. Mr. Whiskers.\" Victor shudder at the name of hybrid cat that once almost killed him, Elsa and Sparky. Iris grimaced remembering the story of the poor cat. \"What's her name?\" Iris asked trying to bring out of those haunted nightmare. \"It's Anne Chambers. Yeah her name is Anne. I just… I want to be friends with her because I know what it feels like to lose your best friend. But she… she sometimes scares me Iris. Her cat supposedly saw the future from its poo and it almost killed. Anne distance herself from a lot of people because she blames herself there were times she felt so lonely I found her in the park crying being picked on. Edgar, Elsa and I try to help her but she can see Elsa and I still have bad memories of her cat so she ran. I just… I just know what I can for her.\" Victor spoke all this like it was a confession in church for a priest to hear. Iris looked at her cousin with slight concern. She thought for a moment and smile. \"Maybe I can help her,\" Iris began turning to her cousin once more, \"I know what she is going through if theres another person who's going through it maybe she will bond with me more easily. Besides I don't know her sins thats well so it might be good to meet someone who knows nothing.\" \"But Iris, you do know. I told you remember?\" Victor asked confusingly. Iris rolled her eyes. \"Cuz, you told me what happen. But I wasn't there to see it first hand to feel any experience you went through. So I pretty much don't know how it felt or look like. I only heard it from your side of the story. So I really don't know what happen Victor.\" Iris pointed out like it was the most obvious thing in the world. Victor just looked at his cousin in surprise. In a surprising way she was right, she wasn't there to experience what happen with the animals coming to life or somehow changing them into mutated monsters. Iris didn't see the horrors that haunted peoples dream for many nights. \"You're right.\" Victor said in awe looking at his cousin in surprise. Iris gave a smug little look crossing her arms over her chest. \"Just because I'm not a genius like you my beloved cousin doesn't mean I'm smart in my own way.\" Victor rolled his eyes and shoved her off the bed making her burst in fits of hysterical giggles. Victor join in the laughter as well and Sparky jumping around barking at the two. After they had calm down Iris laid comfortably on the floor smiling at nothing. They both seem at peace for a bit, Sparky laid his head on Iris' stomach just relaxing like the cousins. \"Sooo what's Nassor guy about?\" Iris asked breaking the silence. Victor thought for a moment and gave this very odd look. \"He's… dark. He pretty much doom and gloom in life.\" \"Victor, that makes no sense dear.\" Iris voice held much confusion. \"What do you mean?\" Victor asked. \"Why does the kid see things like that? Give more explanation hun.\" Victor put more thought in Nassor, he never really talk to the kid. Only Toshiaki ever talk to him and at rare time Bob and Edgar that would talk to him. \"I don't know. You will need to ask Edgar or Toshiaki or meet him yourself. The guy just doesn't really get along with people.\" \"Huh a tough nut?\" Iris asked. \"Well, now that I think about it, yes.\" Silence met them once again. \"So you like anyone?\" Iris asked with much mischief in her tone. Victor gave a small groan, giving a small kick at her foot to shut up her giggles. xxx Iris sighed, today was the day for a new school. She is currently two weeks behind on school since no school would let her regester back home thankfully Victor would catch her up on any class work that she would need to do. She gave a small snort hating the idea of being behind on class work. \"Iris breakfast is ready!\" Susan Frankenstein yelled out. \"Coming!\" The teen walked down stairs thinking what to bring with her to school. \"Iris you look lovely!\" Susan gushed seeing her niece. Iris looked confuse and looked at her outfit. She wore a winter blue loose top that shows a bit of shoulders. It was neatly tucked into an ash color waist skirt with a strange black texture running around it, at the hem the skirt white lace pattern and around her waist where the belt wrapped around her was another white lace pattern, she also wore black short underneath. She wore stripe soft silver and with a very light wax white color that look more like a yellow tights. Her choice of color clothing was very soft that match ever so well but also strange since her hair is bright red. \"I guess…\" Iris said with much doubt. She would usually wore black waist shorts with suspenders but her aunt told her to make a good impression so she took out one of her rare skirts she forgot she had. Iris gave another sigh and sat down eating her aunts homemade waffles. Iris would usually enjoy her aunts cooking but today she just felt nervous about everything. Susan must have notice because she sat next to her niece gently pushing the red loose hairs behind Iris's ears. \"Don't be nervous sweetie. Victor will be right at your side just smile politely and do your best.\" \"What if they heard what happen back at home?\" Iris asked softly feeling dread at the thought of that. Susan smiled sadly at her niece. \"Sweet heart no one knows about it except your uncle, your cousin and I. If anyone gives you any trouble just go to the teacher and if they don't do anything then come to your uncle, your cousin or I because I promise I will bring hell onto them.\" Susan said sweetly but with a determin voice. Iris stared at her aunt in shock, she had never heard her aunt Susan curse. Iris gave a small grin at her aunt and nodded. \"Good now finish up Victor is going to drive you to school.\" \"Hey where is he anyways?\" Iris asked as she began to eat. \"He's in the backyard playing a bit with Sparky. He has been ready for a while just waiting on you dear. Iris don't shovel your food down! You're not going to be late!\" Susan scolded when her niece started to panic and began to eat quickly. \"Sorry Aunt Susan. Just freaking out.\" \"Well I can see that but it doesn't mean you should shovel it down.\" Iris just sighed and finished breakfast. After she was finish she went back upstairs and got her wedge shoes on she wore yesterday. After that she went to the bathroom and started to apply some makeup. Most black eyeliner with coral green eye shadow (its pretty much a blue green thats almost a pastel or neon color depending how you see it) and frost blue lipstick. Again it was strange but it somehow fit her perfectly. It wasn't a lot and it wasn't dark so it didn't make her look like a clown. The eyeshadow and eyeliner made her light blue eyes pop. The blue lipstick… eh she just likes the color. \"Looks like you are bring hell to school in a different way.\" Iris looked up to see Victor giving her one of his sleepy like grins. Iris tilted her head in confusion. \"What do you mean?\" Iris asked. Victor chuckled and pointed at her choice of clothing. \"Everyone at schools tries to look professional and try not to show a lot of color. You my dear cousin have a lot of rather interesting colors that clash together in a very interesting way.\" Most girls would start freaking out and feeling nervous but Iris looked rather shock and annoyed. \"Wow thats just stupid. Why do they do that?\" Iris asked giving this very screwed look just thinking of boring colors. \"To prove they are better than everyone else? I don't know cuz. You, Anne and sometimes Elsa will be the only ones who will be only wearing such bright colors. I just like my black jeans and suspenders so stop giving me that look!\" Iris had given him a pointed look seeing he was wearing black shiny shoes, black jeans with suspenders and a white button up top. \"Fine… But any of those jerks say one god damn word I will personally give them hell.\" Iris promised. Victor smiled at his cousins threat/promise knowing she will go with it at the end. When it was time to go Iris had her book back dangling on her back with her big buckley teal headphones that connected to her walkman, thats right she has a freaking A WALKMAN PEOPLE! (AN: if you have no clue what thats is go on google and look it up… god I feel so old knowing this stuff and I turned 18 just like 2 weeks ago!) When they got outside Iris was surprise to see Victor get in a 1959 blue mercedes (I'm not a car person so I want talk about it so much). She shrugged it off getting in the car. \"You ready?\" Victor asked his cousin as he back out in the driveway. Iris gave a unladylike snort. \"Fuck no.\" Iris smirked making Victor chuckle at his cousin's choice of words. \"Well to bad then. We are off.\" Iris gave a small laugh. When they got at the school Iris was cursing like a sailor under her breath. This is most likely time she would be nervous. \"Iris calm down. If people see you cursing out like no tomorrow they will think you're a delinquent.\" \"Well fuck! This utter bull shit if you ask me! I mean come they can't just judge me for swearing like a fucking sailor!\" Iris whispered. Victor rolled his eyes but frown seeing his cousin was freaking out. He placed a hand on her head calming brushing her hair out of her face. Iris head whipped to his direction \"Iris, calm down alright? I'll be here for you so no worries. Besides remember what my mom said. She will give anyone hell if they hurt you.\" Victor said slowly like talking to a five year old. Iris seemed to calm down and took a shaky breath and said, \"Alright. Lets bring some hell to this school.\" AN: A new chapter! Took a little longer but I had finals to do so dory for those who have an interest in the story that it took too long! Oh since I'm not that great at explaining outfits (I need to be there in person to actually explain something) I have a drawing I did and the ling is on my page if you wish to get the visual look. And to my first reviewer coteusher: (I apologies I'm not really good with spanish and I sometimes don't trust translator for english to spanish because it sometimes messes it up for me, again I apologies) I'm glad you love the story and since you wanted an update I am dedicating this chapter to you! Hope you enjoy this chapter! Fave, Review and all that good stuff![Chapter 3] To say the least, Iris was not happy. Right when she got out of the car students who had taken notice of her would roll their eyes at the girl's clothing. Someone had actually openly scoffed at her seeing someone so… different. Iris had ignored them perfectly fine only listening to her music and following Victor. Someone even said something to Iris, when she saw a cruel look and a twitch of smirk on the persons face Iris just gave them a blank look her eyes avoiding all emotion. When doing so the person was surprise, Iris pulled her headphones back waiting for the person to say something, it was pathetic to say something when a person couldn't hear it. Victor had came back to her side grabbing his cousins wrist, dragging her away from the person. When they got to the office Iris got her schedule and everything else that will be needed. She gave a small grin when she saw she had a music class but groan when she saw she has Chemistry… well better than having anatomy. Iris continue to walk down the locker filled halls looking at the numbers closely trying to find her own. Iris made sure to keep her headphones down to make sure anyone wanted to speak to her or have the balls to go up to her face and make a crude comment. When she had found her locker she realized it was next to a blonde girl and a very tall dark hair boy. Iris gave a small shrug and ignoring Victor's worried look. Iris ignored the others that surrounded her mostly determined to unlock her- her locker. After five tries Iris got angry and punched her locker. \"Jiminy Cricket just open already you stupid thing!\" \"Wow, you didn't curse!\" \"Victor…\" \"Yes?\" \"Shut up.\" He just gave a chuckle. In return Iris stuck out her tongue at him. He gave me a look that said 'very mature of you,' and in return Iris flipped him off and continue to mess with her locker. And finally it open. \"Oh thank baby Jesus it finally open!\" Victor laughed at his cousin while she put her things away not even noticing her locker neighbors have been watching her the entire time. One looking at her with curiosity while the other looked at her much annoyance. \"Yeesh, who ever had this locker last does not know the meaning of cleanliness…\" She muttered while picking some trash the was left behind. Dropping her bag on the floor she continue to clean the ripped and wadded up papers. After she made sure she had it all the trash the redhead went to a trash can that was near the corner and threw everything away. Dusting her hands off she grabbed her bag off the floor and putting everything away. \"What do you have first Iris?\" Victor asked after sometime of silence. \"I have english first, chem second, guitar third, Geometry fourth, lunch, World History fifth, and then….\" Iris stood up straight looking rather confuse. \"What is my last period?\" She question. Victor chuckled at his cousin once again seeing complete confusion on the redhead features. Her nose wrinkled in distaste not remembering her schedule perfectly. \"Iris, I only asked for first period not the others.\" Victor chuckled out again. Iris gave a him a look of annoyance. \"Yes but then you would ask about my other classes that I have after each one. I only wish to get it out of the way now before I forget. Now then…. What the hell do have for 6th?\" She muttered grabbing her stacks of paper she be needing to sign for the office. Looking over her schedule she gave a groan. Victor looked at her confusion. \"I have gym…. GYM! Of all the classes I had to get gym!\" Victor looked confuse at this. His cousin has always enjoyed sports like baseball, tennis, football and basketball. Heck she even enjoys kickboxing, and has a brown belt in karate. \"I thought you enjoyed gym?\" Victor asked. Iris gave a small huff, glaring at the paper as if had done something wrong to her. \"No, in matter of fact I hate school gyms. The teacher are turd nuggets and students complain way too much if things don't go their way. There is no such thing as good sportsmanship in school unless there are jocks with a good heart and know when to back down.\" Iris started rather bluntly. Victor stared at his cousin for the longest moment and finally said, \"Turd nuggets? Really?\" Iris couldn't help but laugh. Her two locker neighbors seemed surprised by her bluntness and her laughter. Her laugh turned a few heads, some of them scoffed at annoyance while other seemed rather curious of the red head. After a few seconds of laughing Iris just smiled kindly at her cousin. \"Victor dear, never say such things again. It sounds weird coming from you.\" \"Whatever you say Iris.\" The redhead merrily grin at her dark haired cousin. Grabbing her books she will be needing for her first two periods she shut her locker closed tight making sure no ones would dare try to take her stuff. After making sure everything is in place she grabbed her cousin's sleeve and giving a tug. \"Ready.\" Victor rolled his eyes at his cousin's childish behavior. Slowly the two began to walk once again going to their first periods. Victor, being the kind cousin he is, showed Iris were her class was first but also pointed out were her other classes were just incase he couldn't meet up with her during passing period. Iris made mental notes were to go and which hall would be quicker for which class to go to. She began mumbling to herself, saying things which mark which hall is which and were certain rooms are at. Students who passed by her gave her odd looks as though she was insane. Victor gave them glares which startled them knowing that the male Frankenstein never cared what people thought of him or his friends but to see him sending glares because they thought something was wrong with the new redhead student was just baffling to them all. Iris paid no attention this, she just continue to mumble to herself looking at the details in the halls hoping it will help her not to get lost. \"Victor!\" A raspy voice yelled out making Iris jump a little but in surprise. She blinked several times realizing that there are other people around her. Looking up she saw Victor waving at someone. \"Hello Edgar, how are you?\" Victor asked. Iris looked over to who his cousin was waving at. To say the least she was surprise to see a boy around her age with a hunch body, very long fingers and some other features that seemed off about him. Iris blinked several times, even though he seemed odd to Iris he looked… adorable. \"Oh good. Good. Just hearing people talk again. Heard that we now have a new \"Strange Girl\" with red hair. Which I do believe is your cousin right there.\" Edgar pointed at Iris with one his long index finger. Iris tilted her head giving a mock pout. \"Ahh people here are so nice, already judging me by my looks. Well woopidoo they can go to hell for all I care.\" Iris said rather boredly not caring for the glares she was getting she just gave them a blank dead look that rather frighten them. Edgar looked at the redhead with surprise. When Victor told him about his cousin he did not expect her to be so… well blunt. Most girl usually held their tongue well except for Elsa. \"Any who, yes I am the new student. Iris is my name, nice to meet you.\" Iris stuck out her hand waiting for Edgar to shake it. The said boy looked surprised, when new people meet him they usually avoid him for how he looks. Slowly he brought his hand up and grasped her giving a gentle shake. Iris smiled brightly at him. \"I'm Edgar.\" The hunch teen introduced himself. Iris let go first and began to look around the halls once more trying to remember every little detail. \"Uh Victor, is your cousin alright?\" Edgar ask seeing that Iris began to mumble to herself while looking at everything blankly. Victor looked at his cousin then back at Edgar. \"Yeah, she's fine. She's trying to remember the details of halls. Don't worry about it.\" Edgar gave a hesitant nod and began to talk to Victor as they walked to Iris' class. When they got to class they spoke with english teacher named Ms. Norris. Ms. Norris gave a syllabus for the class and told her where she will be seated, which happen to be the back of the class near the window. Most students would be happy about such a thing but Iris did not. She rather be in a shady part of the classroom where the sun will not hit her and distract her at the corner of her eye. But she sucked it up and sat at the desk waving goodbye to her cousin. The english teacher caught her up explaining they are reading Macbeth already but mostly giving a quick history on Shakespeare before they can actually read it. The redhead only nod getting out one of her notebooks that she brought with her opening up to a fresh page ready to take notes. Iris sat idly around ignoring the students who enter the room. Getting bored she began to make random doodles on her paper, not being an drawing artist most of her drawings were mostly little stick people with musical notes around them. \"Good morning class.\" Iris paused her doodling and glanced up watching the teacher up front. Finally noticing her surroundings the classroom was filled up with students. Iris blinked realizing she had spaced out when the bell had rung. Sitting up Iris waited for the teacher to continue to talk. \"Now I would like to introduce Iris Frankenstein who will be in our class. Iris would you like to introduce yourself?\" Ms. Norris looked over to Iris who gave a blank stare. Students turned to look at the redhead and broke out in whisper when they heard the name Frankenstein. Iris ignored them and slowly stand from her seat. \"Hello.\" Everyone went silent when she began to speak. Iris took a breath and slowly let it out. \"I am Iris Frankenstein cousin of Victor Frankenstein. I'm a musician mostly play guitar then any other instrument. I'm easy to talk to if you want to get to know me.\" Iris shrugged. \"I rather have people to talk to me then just judge me on my image so please keep the comments to yourself.\" Iris stated rather bluntly not caring if it sounded rude. The redhead looking around and was surprise to see a long blonde hair girl wearing a white sundress with pink belt wrapped around her slim waist. What caught most of Iris' attention was the girl's eyes, how big and wide they are with curiosity and wonder but also with a hint fear. Iris tilted her head and smiled softly at the girl. The blonde girl seemed rather surprised by this but smiled shyly in return. \"Sooo any questions?\" Iris asked rather boredly. One hand went up by a girl. Iris nod her head to her giving her permission to ask something. \"Is your hair naturally red?\" The girl asked rather snootily like. Iris gave her annoyed look. \"Uh yeah, its actually is my natural hair color.\" Another hand went up by a boy this time. And without given permission he asked his question. \"Why are you dressed like you're about to go to a circus?\" Snickers went out through the room. Iris gave him an unimpressed looked. \"Why are you dressed like you're going to a funeral? Got a date with a corpse?\" Iris asked calmly looking at the boy with a blank look. Some snickered at this, other well in shock. The teacher looked rather uncomfortable what has been said but kept quiet slightly curious of the colorful student. Iris looked around waiting for other questions but was surprised to see it was the blonde who raised her hand. Iris gave a nod at her. \"What kind of music do you play?\" She asked softly actually curious of the girl. Iris couldn't help but smile at the idea of talking about music. \"I play rock, alternative at times, sometimes techno and country and on rare times classical.\" Iris looked somewhat daze now wanting to listen or play something, either one she wanted to do it, now. \"Will you being playing outside of class?\" She asked with much interest. Iris thought about it and nodded. \"I was going to bring one of my guitars today so I will have my entertainment but I was told not to by my cousin. Said something about getting to know the school…\" Iris waved her hand in the air trying to remember the reason Victor gave her but couldn't remember. The blonde girl's eyes seem to grow wider with a flash of nervousness but disappeared quickly as it came. \"I would like to hear you play…\" Iris just smiled brightly at this. \"Well since the lady ask I will play.\" Iris gave a small nod. Iris had forgotten about the other classmates. They stared at her as though she was the most strangest person they have ever met other than weird girl who was actually talking the first time in class in God knows how long. Ms. Norris beamed with happiness to see Anne actually speaking and interacting with the student. Ever since the whole ordeal with the pets coming to life or becoming creatures Anne had kept mostly to herself since then. Always being picked on with no friend in the world to be with, now hopefully that will change. \"Well since that is out of the way we will being doing more research on Shakespeare…\" After an hour of class Iris packed up her stuff and looked at her schedule. Chemistry with Ms. Stacey. Shrugging she grabbed her things and was about to leave the classroom only to turn around to see the blonde student. Iris blinked several times in surprise. \"Hello.\" Iris said quite shyly. \"Hello Iris. My name is Anne Chambers, its nice to meet you.\" Anne said rather politely. Iris smiled at the girl feel a welcoming air from the blonde unlike the other students in her class. Anne gave a wistful smile at the new girl. \"Well its nice to meet you Anne.\" Iris said cheerfully with a grin. Anne gave a kind smile that look it hadn't been seen in some time. Iris looked at the girl, so this was the infamous \"Weird Girl\". So far, Iris liked the girl. The blonde seem rather polite wanting a chance to get to know the new girl. \"Who do you have next?\" Anne asked. \"Chem with this Stacey person.\" Iris muttered looking down at her schedule once more. Anne smiled even more. \"I have that class next as well. Would you like to walk with me there? I could show you the way.\" Anne offered. Iris looked at her with slight curiosity. She very much wanted to go with the blonde and get to know her. So far the blonde didn't seem like a distant person who wanted to avoid people it look more like she needed a friend. Iris looked up at the door, not seeing her cousin anywhere. \"Yeah I would like that.\" Iris turned back to Anne with a grin. Anne smiled back. And with that the two girls left the classroom not noticing that stairs they were earning. It was a beginning of weird but strangely, beautiful friendship. AN: Hello readers!

It was June 13th, the day of the graduation ceremony for New Holland High School. It should have been a sunny day, but the sky was filled with gray clouds instead. It should have been a happy day, but for Elsa Van Helsing, it was a sad day. First, she would be starting college in the fall and had no idea what she would major in. Second, she would really miss Victor while she was away at college. Third, the graduation ceremony that was supposed to be a reward seemed more like a punishment to Elsa Van Helsing. She was the class valedictorian, which meant she would have to make a valedictorian speech. And she was no more comfortable performing in public than she had been as the Little Dutch Girl years ago. She had written a speech, and practiced it before a mirror and before her parents and uncle multiple times. But no practice session would be the same as delivering the speech in the New Holland Theater in front of thousands of people. Now it was her big day, and Elsa was nervous. No, nervous would be an understatement. Petrified would be a more appropriate word to describe Elsa right now. Elsa did not get very much sleep. She looked at the clock on her nightstand. It was 5:01 AM. She wished there was a way out. Any way out. She should have done something to get out of this sooner. Maybe if she failed to turn in one homework assignment or gotten an exam answer wrong on purpose, she wouldn't be in this mess. She couldn't pretend to be sick. She was no good at pretending to be anything or anyone. Maybe she could get in some kind of trouble and get barred from attending the graduation ceremony. No, she was too afraid to make her uncle angry to do so. And she didn't want to hurt her uncle's chances of being reelected mayor. Maybe the weather would get so bad that the graduation ceremony would have to be cancelled and everyone would get their diplomas in the mail. There could be a tornado or a flash flood. Either of those disasters would do the trick. Maybe a sinkhole would open up underneath the house in such a way that she would be killed, but her parents and uncle would live. That would be quite a headline in the local newspaper. NEW HOLLAND HIGH VALEDICTORIAN DIES ON EVE OF HER GRADUATION. She climbed back in bed and pretended to be asleep. 5:30 AM. 6:00 AM. 6:30 AM. 7:00 AM. \"Good morning, Elsa!\", said Mr. Burgermeister. \"Or, should I say, Good Morning, New Holland High Valedictorian!\" \"Thank you,\" Elsa replied. She tried to sound happy, but if you listened closely, it would be all too clear she was not. This is only the beginning.[Chapter 2] Elsa crawled out of bed and headed downstairs to eat breakfast. She had plenty of time. The graduation ceremony would not begin until 10:30 AM. She was pleased to see a poster reading \"Congratulations, Elsa!\" in the kitchen. Not only was there a poster, but there was food set out for her as well. Specifically, there was a bowl of Cheerios with mint cookies on top of the bowl. Which meant she would have to eat the cookies first, and then the Cheerios. She did that, and she also ate an apple and drank a glass of milk. Now to get ready. Normally Elsa brushed her teeth for two minutes, but today, she brushed them for almost five. If her valedictorian speech did not go well, as least her teeth would be white. She brushed her hair and proceeded to get dressed. Her graduation cap and gown were both black. She also wore a blue honor sash for being summa cum laude, and a medal for being valedictorian. When she turned to look at herself in the mirror, the reality of what was about to come sank in. She began to tremble. Her hands felt cold as ice. Her mouth felt like cotton balls. Elsa's mother knocked. \"May I come in?\" \"Yes,\" answered Elsa. The door opened. \"Elsa, you look so beautiful and accomplished! But don't get in the car just yet. Your father wants to take pictures first.\" Pictures. Good idea. Posing for pictures for a single photographer could get tedious, but it sounded a lot better than making a valedictorian speech. Hey, maybe her father would get so focused on taking pictures they would lose track of time, rush to the auditorium, arrive too late and she would be barred from attending the graduation ceremony. As she posed for pictures, she wondered, If I am so nervous, how does Victor feel? Is he as nervous as me right now? She thought about asking if she could walk next door to talk to Victor, but decided not to. Her hopes of missing her graduation ceremony were dashed when she heard her mother say, \"Time to go,\" and she looked and saw the clock read 9:50 AM. They all hopped in the car. Her parents sat in the back, and Elsa and her uncle sat up front. Halfway through the trip, ther had to stop at a railroad crossing. There was hope! Maybe the train would abruptly stop on the track, and it would be so long there would be no way around it. That would make for a more humorous newspaper headline. NEW HOLLAND VALEDICTORIAN MISSES GRADUATION CEREMONY DUE TO TRAIN. But Elsa's hopes were dashed. The train disappeared. And before she knew it, she was being dropped off in front of the auditorium. \"Remember to make me proud,\" her uncle said sternly. \"You've got plenty of time,\" her father chimed in more cheerfully. \"Congratulations. Have fun!\" Elsa hopped out of the car, thinking in response to her father's words, I wish I could. Stay tuned for the next chapter...[Chapter 3] Elsa walked up the steps, through the door, and into the meeting room where the graduates were waiting before the procession started. She had to find Victor. Victor was the only person who could help her. Victor was the only person who she could confide in. She wished she could have told her parents or her uncle how she really felt, but feared that doing so would only upset them. She rushed through the crowd of graduates, past Nassor, Toshiaki, and Weird Girl. The longer she looked, the more desperate she became. Finally, she found Victor. Victor appeared to be everything Elsa was not. He was calm, composed, and upbeat. Also, he was wearing the same blue summa cum laude sash Elsa was wearing. \"Hi, Elsa!\" he enthusiastically proclaimed. \"How are you doing?\" asked Elsa. \"I'm eager to get my high school diploma so I can begin the pre-vetrinary program at Penn State,\" was Victor's answer. \"I wish I shared your enthusiasm, but I'm scared to death right now,\" Elsa admitted. \"What if I really mess up my valedictorian speech? Will they not give me my diploma? And what will my uncle think?\" \"They won't withhold your diploma unless you say any bad words in your valedictorian speech,\" Victor reassured her. \"Have you gotten the chance to practice your speech?\" \"Yes, dozens of times, but only for three people. This is different. I'll be speaking to thousands of people. This is even worse than when I was the Dutch Day singer.\" \"When I started playing baseball, I was pretty nervous too. But I got past it by breathing deeply and imagining a movie in my mind of what the baseball would see if it got knocked out of the park. That helped a lot.\" \"Thanks. I'll try that. I hope that helps.\". Elsa left Victor and went to take her place in line. She found taking deep breaths helped a little, but not enough. She needed to visualize something pleasant, but what? The music began to play. The procession started. Elsa took her seat. She breathed as deeply as she could through her nose so as not to make too much noise. She struggled to visualize something pleasant, but she could not do so. Could she ever do so? The principal began speaking. Elsa would be making her speech shortly-or would she? Maybe at some point, the principal would announce that there had been a mistake, that Elsa Van Helsing was not really the valedictorian and someone else was. Maybe that someone would be Victor. Victor would do better at this than she would. That pleasant thought entertained her until she heard the words, \"Ladies and gentlemen, I now present the New Holland High School Valedictorian, Elsa Van Helsing!\" Elsa gulped. This is it. It's too late to escape now. She stood up, walked on stage, and approached the podium. When she stepped up to the podium, she looked around for something, anything that would give her a pleasant visual image. Then, amazingly, miraculously, she saw Victor's face in the crowd, even though it was so far away. That was all she needed. As she began by thanking all her teachers, she imagined herself and Victor walking down a spiral staircase. But it was no ordinary spiral staircase. It was the spiral staircase leading down to the main hall of a royal castle. Victor was wearing a spiffy military-like uniform and Elsa was wearing a long sparkling gown with a necklace and a tiara. She proceeded to thank her parents, imagining Victor's parents as the King and Queen of the castle. When they got close enough, Victor bowed and Elsa curtsied. She closed by reading off a famous quote, imagining her and Victor dancing to beautiful music. Now she was calmer than she had been all day. And then her speech was over. Elsa shook hands with the principal, was handed her diploma, and returned to her seat. The ceremony ended, and Elsa returned home with her family. She posed for more pictures and opened several gifts. Now she was truly, genuinely happy. And finally, it was time to go to bed. Elsa slept soundly. When she woke up the next morning, she realized she learned something wonderful at her graduation ceremony. What we visualize in our minds can be more amazing than what we see with our eyes. The End.

How on Earth did she ever get suckered in by a pettifogger like Edgar?\" Duchess follows his gaze to her oldest and dearest friend. \"She's lonely, Thomas,\" she says softly, remembering how she felt before he entered her life. \"She's only ever had the kittens and myself for company.\" \"A woman like that ought to have men calling from around the block.\" \"She used to, when I was real little, just a kitten myself. But every one of them eventually broke her heart. She gave up trying to find what we have.\" \"What about that lawyer friend of hers?\" \"Georges?\" Duchess' long, fluffy white swishes. \"Oh, she'd never look at him that way. They're just friends.\" \"Friends,\" Thomas says, suggestively waggling the ginger fur above his green eyes, \"can always grow into something more.\" \"Yes, but not with Georges. She knows him too well to ever let him close.\" \"What does that mean?\" Thomas asks. He sits down and curls his tail around his rear haunches, still watching Madame but not with an expression that's almost a frown. He never realized the old girl was so lonely. \"He's out with a new and younger woman every night, or so I've heard her lament.\" \"Maybe he just hasn't found the right one. You know, I was a bachelor for the longest time. I still would be if you and the kittens hadn't come along.\" \"Purrhaps,\" Duchess replies, her soft breath hovering near a purr. \"I admit I had quite well given up myself.\" \"And you thought I was a cad - \" \"Were you not?\" Thomas holds a paw up to the white fur on his chest, but before he can act out any further, he sees the way Duchess is watching him knowingly and relents. \"Yes. Yeah, I was. Very much so. But you were worth changing my ways for. There's bound to be a guy out there somewhere who thinks the same of your Madame.\" \"I'm afraid not. They came and went far too often when I was young, sometimes waltzing out of our lives two or three during a week.\" Thomas' jaw goes slack at that fact. His eyes widen a little as they return to Madame's figure. The old woman still makes a pretty picture, but it's hard to imagine her having so many suitors in a single week. \"You know, sometimes it's the female who's not cut out for the long relationships.\" \"Sometimes,\" Duchess acknowledges, \"but I doubt that's the case with Madame.\" She sighs softly. \"She's just so lonely. I wish I could do something to cheer her, something that would keep her from feeling quite so lonely.\" \"Of course you can,\" Thomas returns. Duchess blinks at him in surprise. \"What?\" she questions. \"Just watch.\" Thomas sashays from around the far corner of the table where they've been watching Madame and approaches her on cool, calm feet. He prowls around her ankles, circling her a few times before leaning in closer and rubbing himself against the old girl's stockinged feet. He pushes against her thin ankles, purring loudly, until he's rewarded with gentle laughter and a bright, wide smile. He looks back at Duchess and winks just before Madame picks him up. \"Oh, you are a cad, aren't you?\" she chuckles, scratching the spot underneath his chin that always itches. She carries him over to the piano and lets him jump down from her arms onto the smooth, black surface. Her wrinkled hands don't feel old or leathery at all as they stroke him in long pets over his head and down his arching back. His purr grows in volume and depth. He bats his head against her palms, bringing more laughter and strokes. \"What's wrong?\" Madame puzzles over him. \"Did you think I needed cheering?\" Madame glances over at where Duchess is only now padding up to them and winks. \"You can't sneak up an old woman. I know you two have been watching me. Whatever for?\" She clucks her tongue at herself. \"As though you can answer me in my language. Heaven knows I've spent years enough with you Aristocats to know that, with all the things you do learn, you'll never be able to pronounce English.\" She frowns down at him. \"If only I could learn Catinese!\" She throws her regal head back and laughs as though she's made a joke. Thomas looks down at Duchess and gives her the feline equivalent of a shrug, rolling his muscular shoulders while Madame is not looking. Duchess leaps on to the piano next to Thomas and gently pushes her furry head against Madame's other hand. \"Ah, yes, you two, my dear girl.\" Madame beams at them and strokes them both in unison. \"I know you've been watching me. What? Are you afraid the old woman's lonely? Never! Not with you cheerful lot in my life!\" The kittens suddenly race through the parlor, Berlioz and Toulouse close on Marie's little, white tail. \"KITTENS!\" Duchess mewls out at them. She springs elegantly from the top of the piano and chases after them, intent on reminding them of their manners. Madame watches them go as Thomas watches the sight in her fading, old eyes turn wistful. \"I'm not lonely,\" she tells him, \"no matter what she might have told you.\" She laughs again, her lips lifting into another grin. \"Don't think I don't know you two talk about me, as all you felines talk about all us humans! But, really, you needn't worry about me.\" Thomas peers closer into her eyes as she continues rubbing his fur. \"Truly, you need not. I'm not at all lonely. Our little family there,\" she tells him, indicating Duchess and the three kittens she's now bathing, \"are all the accompaniment I need, but I did used to wonder what would become of them after I pass. You see, I may not be lonely, but I also do not wish to leave them lonely. That is the true reason why I succumbed to that cad, Edgar's, charm. But now that you're here, I need not worry about them, had I?\" she asks, briskly and fondly scratching his head until he purrs. \"I have Georges to make certain my will is fulfilled and you to make certain their lives are full.\" She leans down and kisses Thomas' forehead, her breath making his ears twitch. She smiles into his eyes as though they're sharing a secret. \"I know you'll do a fantastic job of keeping them happy and safe after I'm gone, and that's all I can ever really ask for. Thank you, Thomas,\" she says and resumes petting him as Duchess prepares her kittens for their morning practice. Thomas purrs, leaning into her hand's embrace. His eyes meet hers again. They stare into each other's gaze for a long time. Then he winks as though to tell her not to worry and assure her that he does indeed have this, this being watching over their family for the rest of his life and, as she said, making certain they're safe and happy. Nothing could make him happier himself than spending the rest of his days making certain Duchess and their kittens are happy, loved, and safe, although he does hope Madame will not be leaving them any time soon. He'll miss the old girl when she goes to wherever the souls of humans go when their bodies become cold and stiff. He wonders, not for the first time, if it's the same place cats go to that great Milk Saucer in the Sky, but surely he'll see her again somewhere up there. Surely they'll all be together again somewhere when they've outlived the usefulness of their bodies, not, he assures himself, watching the rest of their family, that that time is coming any time soon. For just a second, he feels tiredness in the fingers stroking his fur. Quickly, he rubs against them, drawing Madame's mind back away from the inevitable. He looks up at her and winks again, wishing that he could tell her in her own language that she's right. She has no need to worry for he will always take care of their family. Duchess and their kittens will never again be lonely while he still lives, and neither, he vows, bumping his head harder against her palm, will this elegant, old lady who's as much a mother to his beloved Duchess as any mother can be to a child. Madame throws her head back and laughs, the beautiful sound resonating like music throughout the room. \"Oh, you are a cad, aren't you?\" she teases. Thomas denies nothing. He only purrs, looks over at Duchess, and winks again. He'll keep his ladies, and his sons too, happy for as long as they're in his life, and that, in turn, will keep him happy for the rest of his own days.

The cats were in a drugged sleep inside their basket. Said basket rested gently in the cab attached to the bike and as for the bike, it kept backfiring causing the hat on Edgar's head to keep comically shooting up in the air off his head only to land square in place every time. (Hey its physics pure and simple, don't judge me. I just narrate; stop looking at me like that). He had made a mistake out of concern when he neared the police station for he maneuvered as quickly as he could away from the place only to find himself going down the steps towards the subway. He quickly got back out of there somehow. (Don't ask me man, its just pure authentic action and no, I don't have the time to explain it all.) Across bridges and down streets, until he was going down countryside roads, Edgar kept going. He didn't know where to leave them, he was simply determined to leave them far from London so that they had no hope of returning. His path took him by an old windmill that slowly turned in the night air. Large stacks of gathered hay dotted the landscape. Under a large barrow, rested a large St. Bernard. The one thing that was notable was his ears because one had slowly perked up. The rumbling and backfiring of Edgar's movements had reached him. Now fully alert, he rose and BWUMP! \"MMPH!\" he snorted shaking his head in annoyance at bumping his head. \"Hey Lafayette! Where are you?\" he called putting his head down on something that was in a haystack. \"Lafayette!\" No response that he was aware of. \"Lafayette!\" \"Well I'm right here!\" yelled the poor Basset hound whose ear the other had stepped on without thinking so that he could not pull himself off the ground to respond. It was always like this with the poor guy trailing after the larger dog. They were what appeared to be strays at first glance, but in fact they lived on the farm and had made a living out of listening. Well, at least one of them was always listening. \"Listen! Wheels approaching.\" The Bernard stepped off Lafayette's ear and began walking for the gate. \"Oh Napoleon,\" groaned Lafayette fully emerging from the haystack where he had been resting comfortably, \"we done bit six whole tires today! Chased four motor cars and bicycle and scooter!\" \"Hush yer mouth!\" snapped Napoleon. They shared, possessed rather, an antagonistic relationship together. Lafayette was always the receiver of lesser things, always given orders, always this, always that, but never in charge or permitted to lead. The St. Bernard lifted up his right ear and cocked his head towards the noise. \"It's a motorcycle. Two-cylinder, chain drive, one squeaky wheel on the front its sounds like.\" They began trotting down to the wooden gate which was open. \"Now you go for the tires,\" instructed Napoleon, \"and I'll go right for the seat of the problem.\" \"How come you always grab the tender part for yerself?\" groaned Lafayette turning his head to look at Napoleon and causing himself to trip over his long floppy right ear. \"Cause I outrank ya that's why,\" Napoleon gruffly replied, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"Now stop beatin' your gums and sound the attack!\" Woof! Woof-woof-woof! Woof! Woof! Woo-woo-woo-woof! Woof! Napoleon grimaced in annoyance. \"That's mess call !\" \"Heh-heh! Made a mess of it, huh?\" chuckled Lafayette. \"You can be replaced ya know?\" continued Napoleon grumpily. \"Okay let's charge. Who-ooft!\" Napoleon stepped on the hound's tail stopping him so he fell flat out in front of the fence. \"Wait a minute. I'm the leader. I'll decide when we go.\" He paused for a moment. \"Here we go. CHARGE! \" He leapt over Napoleon down the road with the hound charging after him joyfully. Bu-bu-bum-ba-bum! (Insert the bugle sounds for charge or something of that nature. Hey don't look at me. I didn't write this silly story. I just read the script. Stop criticizing me.) Down the road the dogs ran howling and baying. Edgar, needless to say, freaked out at the sight of the two dogs on the bridge. He promptly swerved out of control and went down the side of the hill losing the basket with the cats in it as the bike went bumpity bumpity down into the drink. The dogs promptly ran after him into the water. (Okay this is where it gets interesting. Just…bear with me okay. The writer obviously had a very overactive imagination.) Edgar promptly drove out of the water on the underside of the bridge, the circle, with the dogs running after him. (I know it's against the laws of gravity.) And then did so a second time. (Sound effects time.) Vroom! Ruff, ruff, runwaywhat-goomph! Vroom! Grruff! Gruff! RRRRGGUUUPHTT! (They wrote it, not me. Guess I don't speak dog.) With a watery roar Edgar went up the other side of the hill and caught up to twenty feet of air and landed with a tremendous Brash! before continuing along with a Put! Put! of the bike. The side car was full of water, and two things that weren't the basket full of the cats. Edgar looked over to be sure everything was all right…well obviously it wasn't all right because angry eyes stared back at him from the hat he had lifted up. Edgar gave a yelp of alarm and was instantly fully standing on the handle bars, rump completely exposed for biting. Which Napoleon promptly did, exposing Edgar's unsophisticated boxers. \"Yeow! Nicedoggydogbenice! Heelrolloverplaydeadaauugghhh!\" (A rather crude, crude mind you, translation of Edgar's rushed babbling as he was spinning like crazy cause the handle bars on the bike were loose so he kept spinning in circles. What do these people do for a living? Its beyond me. Yes, I am rolling my eyes.) The last part was because both dogs bit him at the same time getting spun around with Edgar. Except, Lafayette had grabbed a coat tail instead of the \"tender part\" and his grip slipped. (More sound effects.) Fwipt! Crash! Pssswheeettt! BNNNNN! (Again, bear with me guys. Sigh. This job is so tough.) Lafayette went into a tree only to be rocketed right back at Edgar who had seized his umbrella and was still standing on the handle bars, with the bike still impossibly still going forward, while beating the tar out of Napoleon desperately. Lafayette collided with Edgar's rump sending him with a \"YEOW!\" off the bike while the hound joined his partner in crime in the side car as the airborne Edgar braked his unbelievable flight with his umbrella. (Tough umbrella, that, to hold a man's weight.) Napoleon took the driver's seat with joy while Lafayette reclined joyfully in the cab. He chuckled. \"This sure beats runnin' Napoleon!\" He was still laughing when he noticed the same thing that the other did: they were running straight towards a tree! BWOCK! The connection between cab and bike was severed with Lafayette going left, Napoleon right. Lafayette steered his one-wheeled craft around and went in the opposite direction back towards his partner. (Steered. Yeah, I don't get it either. But, hey, I couldn't possibly begin to do that. Probably because I'm not a dog.) Edgar's umbrella (yes, he was still aloft somehow, drifting slowly down) gave out and flipped upward so he suddenly plunged down and landed miraculously on the bike with Napoleon. Both sides suddenly gave a start as they realized they were charging on a collision course with the other. Napoleon leapt into Edgar's arms and Edgar clung to him. But both ended up swinging past the other only for Lafayette to arrest his course and turn about thanks to having grasped Edgar's pink, and exceedingly strong, suspenders and hanging on. The two collided as the suspenders snapped the hound, cab and all, back towards the bike. (Rather snappy those suspenders. But seriously though, I would have thought the jokes were over by now. Guess the writers had a lot of time.) The vehicles (vehicles?) approached the windmill and Edgar leapt up and clung to one of the blades but Napoleon quickly leapt after him and got another good bite in, and held on. All this time (for reasons that never make sense, guess it was supposed to be silly) the bike and cab with Lafayette kept racing in circles around the mill. Edgar kept hanging on while Napoleon skidded to a halt on the ground having ripped off another chunk of the butler's pants. BWANG! The bike ran him over, hat and all. Needless to say, the Bernard watched it continue onwards with shock. (Why would he do that? Don't know. Never been run over before.) Lafayette was observing all of this when the next blade hooked him by the collar and carried him after Edgar. (Pure accident of course, but who's really looking?) And the cab also proceeded to run over Napoleon. (Funny, and the guy deserved it. Sir, put down the tomato, I am entitled to my opinion even if I am reading your script.) Needless to say, Edgar noted the hound's presence and quickly leapt from the blade he was on and the dog right after him. Somehow Edgar still had his umbrella with him and it was open again while Lafayette caught the butler's legs and began spiraling in a circle downward. Napoleon ran in a circle down below pushing the cab around seeking to catch the butler. Edgar didn't fall; rather his shoes did, for Lafayette slid down and the shoes came off with the hand leaving Edgar's feet bare and devoid of covering and dog. Napoleon gave a start when he realized that the human was not in the cab but quickly noticed Lafayette eagerly pointing. Neither dog failed to notice the umbrella give out (again) and Edgar somehow landing atop the motorcycle (again). The chase was on! \"Step on the gas Napoleon!\" Lafayette eagerly called back, emphatically gesturing for more speed. \"I got 'er wide open!\" called back his partner leaning down behind the cab and goosing it hard with his feet. They caught up and Lafayette reached out and caught the bike but Napoleon attempted to straighten his course with just one wheel and the bike leaned to one side. All of this caused the hound to be comically stretched like an accordion between the two. Zrrrrriiiiinnnkkkkk! (insert trumpet sound effects for the hanging on.) Edgar noticed and, with a nasty smile) proceeded to step on the hound's hands. He fell back into the cab but quickly shook life back into his hands with a frustrated growl determined to try again. No need to bother. The butler's bike swerved just right and his right foot wound up planted on the cab but then his legs split like a wishbone so that he was \"running\" on his hands on the ground with no umbrella looking absolutely ridiculous. Lafayette smiled at the opportunity to have the \"tender part\" and rolled up a pant leg. (Insert whatever crunchy sound effects you want here, I'm tired of reading this thing.) The dog promptly began chomping the leg like a prime piece of chicken. (Can't describe the man's face here. Use your imagination.) \"DOOOWWW!\" yelped the butler somehow leaping back on to the bike. (Amazing what pain makes you capable of.) The pursuers and the pursued split in their paths and the cab with both dogs ran into a fence, sending both headlong into the mud of the pig pen. BBBBWEEEE! SPLAT! SPLAT! Edgar laughed at that heedless of just where he was headed. KKKRRROOOOMMM! Headlong and through the other side of the windmill. Needless to say, the man moved it a good ten to fifteen feet from its original place. (Math is not my strong suit. Sorry. Best guess.) With that, Edgar sped off into the night minus his original cargo. All he wanted now was to get home. (Would want the same as him after an experience like that . Good night everybody! Phew!)

I think the one I like in particular is the one he has with Marie. Seeing as he is her dad now, I wanted to do something with that. I own nothing. The Aristocats belong to Disney. I don't own the cover image either. Enjoy the story! Rain splattered loudly against the window panes, accompanied by loud thunder. Lightning flashed, casting shadows of the trees outside and furniture across the luxuriously decorated room through the window. Many at this time were asleep, undisturbed by the storm raging outside their dimmed houses. For those still awake, a few just laid in bed or at their desks, watching or remaining unfazed by the weather. But for some... \"Eek,\" cried out a white kitten, charging under the blanket in her bed after a particularly loud clap of thunder and bright flash of lightning. For anyone in the room at that moment, all they could see in the bed was a little, quivering lump under the soft, pink blanket. For the person in the room at the moment, they decided to come closer and check up on the shivering kitten. \"Marie,\" he called out, his voice in a hushed whisper as to not frighten her more. The lump stopped shivering for a moment before a head popped out from underneath. \"Dad,\" she replied, wincing and ducking back under at the next sound of thunder rumbling. O'Malley paused for a moment, thinking about what to do at a moment like this. Softly he climbed into the bed and gently lifted up the blanket off of her. He then slowly curled around her, taking her crying form in-between his forelegs. She stiffened as his tongue began to lick off the tears falling down her cheeks, before giving a loud cry and turning to his chest and burying her face in his fur. \"Shh Marie, shh. It's okay, it's okay, I've got you,\" he murmured quietly. \"I-I'm sorry,\" she panted out between shudders. \"I-I'm not usually s-so s-s-scared during storms. Just ever since E-E-Edgar threw us out and it began raining, I've been so frightened of them. I-I keep thinking he'll come back to take us and I'll be alone and I-I... I just- eek,\" she screamed when thunder rumbled again and she pressed herself even closer to him, cries renewed full force. His head came to rest on her back and a purr emerged from his throat, soon surrounding her shivering body with the soothing warmth and calming vibrations. Slowly, her cries and shudders lessened and she slumped against him tiredly. A tiny purr of her own came up as he began to lick the tears off her face. \"Easy Marie, shh. It's okay. I understand where this fear is coming from, but know that it will never ever happen again. Not while I'm here. You'll always stay safe here, with me, your mother, your brothers, Madame, Roquefort, Scat Cat and the gang, Fru Fru, everyone. As long as they're here, you won't be alone. I promise you you're safe.\" Her face turned up to look at him and they stared at each other for a moment before she stood up and turned around before settling into a ball right between his forelegs. As her head came to rest against him, he swore he could hear a tiny whisper of \"thank you\" come up before she fell into sleep once more. The storm gave one last rumble of thunder and crack of lightning, but she simply nuzzled against him. \"Goodnight Marie,\" he softly whispered into her ear, before setting down his head right beside her. As the rain started to die outside, the two cats slept peacefully beside each other for the rest of the night. Am I the only one who thinks the entire conflict of the film might have left some negative effects on the kittens? I'm sure it might have taken at least a few days to relax back at home after what Edgar did and tried to do to them. Though I'm sure O'Malley and the others would've eagerly stepped up to help them out. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the story. Please leave a review and feel free tp check out my other stories.

I've had a bad case of writer block, and just different things going on in life in general. But I'm back! And there will be many more stories to come! This story makes place a few mouths before the movie. I've always thought it was interesting that Toulouse had an interest in painting instead of music, yet in the film he does show that he knows how to play piano like Berlioz. So, this is a little something I came up with that could explain all that. Music was a familiar friend to the Bonfamille Mansion, especially for one Adelaide Bonfamille. From the outside, many of the people who passed by the impressive house assumed that it was the Madame herself who created the lovely tunes that were so pleasant to the ears; but little did they know that it was not the elderly French aristocrat, but in fact, her talented and beloved family of aristocats. But on this day, the music that emerged from the mansion was not so lovely at all. In no way was it a bad sound, but that's all it was really, just sound. Music has passion, emotion, and creativeness laced into it; these notes that were coming from the grand piano lacked all the elements that a piece needed to be called music. Sound and notes were nothing until a musician came along and embraced them in their soul and poured them back out with all their heart. It was clear that the young musician did not take in and feel the sound that had the potential to become something more, and thus, what had been produced was empty and unhappy. It was based upon this knowledge that Duchess entered the elegant room to find her young tabby kitten, Toulouse perched on top of the tall piano bench attempting to play, what should have been a happy, upbeat tune. With a smooth and graceful motion, the snow-white cat leapt upon the bench and sat next to her son, curling her soft tail around her paws in a most feline lady-like manner. She smiled down at the small kitten as he continued to paw away at the keys; not quite sure if he had heard her approach or not. \"Hello, Toulouse. Getting in some extra practice, are we? That's good darling, very good!\" She praised with a voice like silk. At the sound of her voice, Toulouse stopped playing and looked up at his mother. \"Oh, hi Mama.\" He said quietly as he removed his paws from the ivory and sat down on the bench. Duchess studied her kitten for a moment, his little whiskers drooped as he frowned and his face was downcast, bright green eyes, that were usually so lively, were now filled with sadness. It was clear that something was troubling her little one, but she was unsure of what it could be. \"Is everything alright, my love?\" He looked up slowly, surprise present in his eyes now as well. \"Well…umm…\" he hesitated, unsure of what to say. He looked down again, his paws turned towards each other in nervousness, and what appeared to be guilt. She was concerned, Duchess didn't ever want her kittens to feel embarrassed or nervous to talk to her about their problems. Out of the three of them, Toulouse was the one who tried to act the toughest. Duchess was doing her best to raise them to be a lovely lady and dashing gentlemen, but at such young ages, it proved difficult. Especially since Toulouse had this recent desire to be an ally cat. But, no matter what, she wanted to make sure that all three of them knew that they could always come to her for anything. \"Toulouse, darling, you can tell me. What is it that troubles you?\" He looked up into the face of his mother, more relaxed but still hesitant. He swallowed before speaking. \"Well, umm…Mama I just…I just don't think I'm…that I'm very…well, good at the piano.\" Duchess was slightly surprised by this, but she hid it well. When it came to their lessons, Marie followed in her footsteps, and discovered she had a voice made for singing; while Berlioz and Toulouse practiced the fine art of music on the piano. Out of her two sons, it was Berlioz who excelled and picked up the skills the quickest. But, by no means did she ever believe that Toulouse was inferior, far from it; she loved to hear how differently they played, and then how they would come together to create something new. \"I think you play beautifully, my dear. It takes time and many lessons to become a master pianist. Everyone has to start somewhere, but with patience and lots of practice, you'll get there one day.\" She smiled down at him, hoping that she helped to lift his spirits. He lowered his head. \"Yeah…practice.\" He said slowly, his voice sad as if the very mention of the word was worse than being sent to bed early after misbehaving. This hadn't gone unnoticed by his mother. \"Don't you like to practice, Toulouse?\" His little head shot up, the nervousness and uncertainty returning to his eyes once again. \"Uh…well, I…. umm…\" he stuttered, trying to find the right words. Feeling defeated, he lowered his head once again and closing his eyes he whispered, \"No…not really, Mama…\" That's when she put it all together. That's when she understood what had been bothering him. But before she could answer, little eyes, shining with unshed tears peered up at her. \"You're-you're not mad…are you, Mama?\" That just about broke her heart. \"Oh, darling, of course not!\" she gently assured. She came closer and wrapped her tail around him for comfort, and as he snuggled against her forelegs, she licked the top of his head lovingly. \"I could never be mad over something like that.\" She smiled as she heard and felt him purr against her leg. \"Thanks, Mama.\" He said with a smile of his own. Duchess was pleased to see that her kitten was happy again, his apparent fear of her anger at his confession having been proven false was a huge relief for him. But she couldn't help her lingering curiosity as to how this whole situation came about in the first place. \"Do tell me though, my love; why is it that you do not enjoy practicing anymore? I always thought you liked the piano.\" \"Well…\" he looked up at her. \"I did at first, but not as much as Berlioz. And I do like practicing with him sometimes, like when we play together, that's fun. But, it's sometimes also not fun too…\" Her smile grew at his improper sentence. Normally, she would have corrected him, but she decided to let it go for now. She listened to the rest of what he had to say, slowly nodding as it all became clear. \"I understand.\" She replied once he finished his explanation. \"You do?\" \"Of course. Toulouse, everyone is different, we all have our likes and dislikes. It's what makes us unique. We all have talents as well that make us unique.\" He tilted his head at the use of this new word. \"What's a talent?\" \"A talent is a skill for doing something.\" She clarified. \"There are many, many talents in the world; some have the same talents while others have different ones. A talent is also something that you enjoy doing and practicing. No matter how skilled someone already is, they practice to improve because it is what they love.\" \"Oh!\" He nodded in understanding. \"So…it's like how Berlioz loves to play piano and how Marie loves to sing. They love to do it, and they're good at it?\" \"Very good, that is correct. Those are their talents and those are the things that they enjoy doing the most.\" Toulouse grinned, proud of himself for learning a new word and understanding exactly what it meant so quickly. However, a new thought began to turn in his mind, causing him to slowly lose his smile once again. \"Mama, if the piano isn't my talent, then what is?\" \"Well,\" she began thoughtfully with a tilt of her head. \"That's something you'll have to discover for yourself, darling.\" \"But…But how will I know when I find it if it's the right one? What if I never find it? What if I don't have any talents at all?!\" Duchess could feel his fear and concern in her own heart. There was a time, long ago, when she was just a kitten that the same worries filled her as well. Not knowing what it was that made you special, made you unique, made you who you are in this world. She understood his situation all too well. A warm, gentle smile appeared on her face as she took in the sight of her young son. \"Now, now, Toulouse, do not fret. Everyone has a talent and one day you'll find yours. It just takes time, you'll see, and once you've found it you'll know, because you'll feel it, and it will be the best feeling you'll ever have.\" Words once said to her in her youth, had just been passed down to her own child. Her only hope was that they would brighten his spirits and encourage him to search until he found what he was looking for. \"Wow…\" he was awestruck, eyes shining with new-found determination. He piped up excitedly with a sudden thought. \"Mama, can my talent be to become an ally cat?!\" To show his enthusiasm, he leapt down from the bench, orange fur raised high upon his back with a croaky sounding meow. Spittle flying from his mouth as he attempted to hiss in an intimidating manner. Duchess, unable to suppress a giggle each time he did this display, hopped down from the seat as well. \"Why don't we save that one for more of a hobby?\" she said with a smile. Toulouse licked his lips before smiling up at her in return. \"Yes, Mama.\" I hope you enjoyed! Please leave a review and chapter two will be up soon! :) ","Summary":" So, its been a while.

His tail flicks back and forth rather nervously as he surveys the Paris skyline. Yes, this dashing cat is none other than Thomas O'Malley, the king of the alley. True to what the male cat has said, today is a very big day for him. It's February 14th, Valentine's Day, and Thomas is nervous. Contrary to popular belief, even big, bad alley cats can get scared. Just don't tell Toulouse that. The young orange kitten would surely be heartbroken if he found out his role model gets scared. However, Thomas has good reason to be worried. It is, after all, his first Valentine's Day with Duchess, and he wants to make sure everything goes right. \"Duchess should be waking up right about now,\" Thomas whispers into the morning air, his nerves starting to get the best of him as he thinks of his new mate and wife. They had officially gotten married in November; that was the day that Thomas O'Malley has considered the sole rival of the best day of his life. The other contender is the day he met Duchess and the kittens in the first place. Duchess awakens from her slumber, her sapphire colored eyes opening slightly before being blinded by the sun. She blinks a few times before turning to look down at the three kittens sleeping by her side. Marie, ever the little princess, has her paws propped up on Berlioz's back, much to the ebony kitten's disapproval. She has the most adorable expression on her face, her dreams no doubt filled with happy dreams and love. Toulouse, on the other hand, sleeps the exact opposite of Marie. Snores escape the orange kitten's mouth as he continues dreaming, and Duchess is almost certain she hears soft hisses coming from her oldest son's mouth. \" He must be having one of his alley cat dreams again,\" Duchess thinks to herself as a smile crosses her lips. Berlioz twitches in his sleep, small amounts of drool slipping out of his mouth every once in a while, and it makes Duchess chuckle. She loves to watch her kittens sleep; they all look so peaceful and like little angels. Granted, the she-cat always believes her children look like angels, but even more so when they are sleeping contentedly by each other's sides. It's then that Duchess realizes that something is missing. Glancing over her shoulder, Duchess notices that Thomas is not behind her like he so often is when they wake up. Her new mate is always sleeping behind her, often times wrapping a paw around her waist, pulling the white furred aristocat into his arms. Yet, there is not the familiar warmth of his white and orange fur behind her, none of his unique scent that smells like a mixture of the alley and Madame's kitchen downstairs. \"Thomas?\" Duchess softly calls out, searching the room for her husband. After a few seconds, she still doesn't get a response. Duchess gently detaches herself from beside the kittens, making sure Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse do not wake up alarmed as to where their mother is going. \"Thomas?\" Duchess tries again, looking across the small room with wide eyes, fear starting to creep into her heart. What if he's left me like the kitten's birth father? No, that's a horrible thought. Thomas wouldn't do that; he's not like that. He loves me; he loves all of us. It's then that a piece of paper on the floor catches Duchess' eye. She quietly pads over to it, not sure what she's expecting to find. Upon reaching the piece of paper, Duchess notices it's a note from Thomas. Now, to any human, the note would just look like a bunch of haphazardly placed cat paws that had been dipped in red and gold paint. To a cat, however, the paws made a note that spelled out actual words. Good morning, Duchess. Don't wake the kittens up just yet, baby. I have a surprise waiting for you on the roof. I promise you'll love it. Love ya, -Thomas Duchess smiles at this, wondering what her roguishly handsome mate could have in store for her. She tosses one last look back at the sleeping kittens, checking to make sure they are all still safe and sound before she heads for the roof. If Thomas O'Malley has a surprise, Duchess is sure he is going to go all out for her. Not five minutes later, Duchess has reached the top of the roof, a smile on her face as she approaches where she assumes Thomas is waiting for her. Orange and white fur is nowhere in sight, but Duchess knows that Thomas is probably just playing a trick on her. It seems to be one of his favorite ways to pull a grand romantic gesture out without Duchess getting too suspicious beforehand. Rose petals softly begin to fall around Duchess' head, and she softly laughs and sighs as one falls behind her left ear. The petals keep falling for a few more seconds, and blue eyes soon look up to meet amber ones. \"Hi, baby,\" Thomas smiles at his mate, slowly coming down from the tree branch above Duchess' head. \"Good morning, Thomas. What's all of this for?\" Duchess asks, moving over to Thomas and nuzzling her head against his chest once he is out of the tree. \"Happy Valentine's Day, Duchess,\" Thomas whispers in her ear, giving her cheek a quick loving lick. \"I did all of this to show you how much I love you,\" he continues, beginning to lead her towards another section of the roof. Duchess lets out a small gasp when she sees what all Thomas has in store for her. \"So, what do you think?\" the orange tom inquires, hoping his wife likes what he has planned. \"Thomas, everything looks beautiful, darling,\" Duchess happily sighs, a slight blush coming over her cheeks. A blue and red blanket has been spread across the roof, big enough for Duchess and Thomas to recline comfortably on together. Two bowls of milk sit on the blanket, extra cream in them, just the way Duchess and the kittens like it. Roses are placed near one bowl, along with a satin pink bow and matching diamond collar sitting beside the red roses. For his first Valentine's Day with Duchess, Thomas has certainly gone above and beyond everything the she-cat could ever imagine. \"I'm glad you like it, Duchess. Now, shall we, my love?\" he smiles, taking one of her paws as they walk along the roof tiles. \"You are a shameless flatterer, Thomas O'Malley,\" Duchess tells him, sitting down behind the milk bowl she has deduced is hers. \"Baby, come on. Don't say that,\" Thomas remarks, his amber eyes looking slightly ashamed. \"I haven't even started that phase yet,\" he laughs, which makes Duchess softly cuff him over the ear with her paw. \"And what might you mean by that, Thomas?\" Duchess giggles, not knowing what her alley cat has in store for her. \"You'll see soon enough, Duchess. For now, let's just drink our milk and enjoy the sunrise,\" he answers, turning his head to look at the pink sky as the sun begins to rise over the Paris skyline. About half an hour later, all of the milk is gone, and Thomas has come over to lie beside Duchess. She lays her head on Thomas' shoulder, purring contentedly when he licks the side of her face to clean the milk off of her whiskers. Duchess then proceeds to give Thomas' cheek a lick as well, making the orange tom purr unexpectedly as his amber eyes begin to close. He would not trade this moment with his mate for anything. \"Thomas,\" Duchess speaks up, her voice snapping her mate out of his daze. \"Yes, Duchess?\" he responds, looking her in her sparkling blue eyes. \"Would you mind helping me with my bow?\" she sweetly asks, gently holding the pink satin bow between her paws as she hands it to Thomas. \"Of course, darling,\" Thomas smiles, gently wrapping the bow around Duchess' left ear. \"There, now. You look even more perfect than usual,\" he compliments, which makes Duchess smile so wide at him. \"Is this some of your shameless flattery now?\" \"Well, yes and no. Would you like to hear the rest of what I was going to say?\" A nod comes as his answer, and Thomas feels his heart soar; at the same time a lump starts to form in his throat. \"Duchess, you are the most amazing cat I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. I, uh, well, I wanted to make this Valentine's Day special for you, since it's our first one together. I guess, what I'm saying is….\" Thomas starts off, nervously starting to run his words together, a trait Duchess has identified with his uneasiness. \"Keep going, my love. You're doing splendidly,\" she encourages, wanting to hear the rest of what Thomas has to say to her. \"Oh, really? You're serious?\" \"Very serious, Thomas.\" \"All right then, baby. I love you, Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse with all my heart and soul. There. I said it. The four of you are the most amazing things that have ever happened to me. I find myself thanking that mean ol' Edgar from time to time because without him kidnapping ya, I never would have gotten the chance to meet you and your lovely kittens,\" Thomas reveals, his amber eyes locking onto Duchess, filled to the brim with love for her. \" Our kittens. And, you are one of the most amazing things that has ever happened to me, too. Oh, Thomas. You are so sweet. Yes, I am glad to have been kidnapped if it means I met you,\" Duchess smiles, nuzzling her head under O'Malley's neck. \"Yeah. And, Duchess, there are so many things I love about you, that I can't possibly keep a list of them all. Something new gets added every day. But, let me count the top ways that I love you,\" he sweetly whispers into his mate's ear. \"Firstly, you are an absolutely fantastic mother to your kittens; I mean our kittens. I've never seen a mother so devoted to her kittens before, and it makes me proud to be your mate and the new father to Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz. Let's see, number two has got to be your sparkling sapphire eyes. They can light up any dark day, baby. I would gladly get lost in a storm with you if it meant your eyes could light the way home. Thirdly, your smile is just one of the best I've ever seen. Sometimes when you smile at me, I wonder what it is that you see in me, a dirty old alley cat who's been in his fair share of fights and narrow escapes. And, the last one I'll mention is your singing voice. Man, when I hear you and Marie singing when Berlioz plays the piano, I find myself wondering if I married an angel and was blessed with another one as my daughter. You see, Duchess, if I was to continue the list of how much I love you, I would run out of numbers before I even came close to the end of the list,\" he smiles, his green eyes filling with a few tears. \"Oh, Thomas. That was beautiful, my love. I am so happy to have you in my life,\" Duchess admits to her mate, moving her lips closer to his face. \"But, did you really mean all of those things?\" she blushes, never being one to compliment herself or see the best in herself. \"Every word, baby. I meant everything I said, Duchess.\" \"I have something to tell you, Thomas.\" \"What is it, Duchess?\" Thomas asks in concern, wondering why she is suddenly changing the subject. Duchess leans in closer, whispering to Thomas. A smile crosses over the ginger tom's face as he hangs on to every word his mate and true love is whispering. \"What are they saying?\" a young kitten speaks up from his hiding place on the roof, shoving his brother out of the way. \"I wouldn't know, Berlioz. Your talking is drowning out all of their talking!\" Toulouse talks back, shoving Berlioz off of his back. \"Both of you shut it! You're going to get us caught,\" Marie hisses at her brothers. They could be so annoying, especially when trying to sneak around. \"Mama and Daddy think we're still asleep, remember? We have to be quiet,\" the only female kitten continues to tell her brothers, trying to creep a little closer without her parents noticing her presence. Not that she likes being nosy, but Marie is a big fan of romance, especially that between her mother and new father. From the first moment they saw him, Marie knew that she and her mother were both going to like Thomas O'Malley, though in a little bit differently. Duchess would love him as a husband and Marie would love him as a father. Yet, the little kitten loves her father and wishes her future husband acts in a very similar manner to Thomas. \"Are you serious, Duchess?\" Thomas asks, his mouth hanging open at the thought of what his mate has just told him. \"I'm quite serious, Thomas,\" Duchess smiles back at her love, her blue eyes sparkling as she looks at him with love. \"Then that means…\" \"I'm expecting your kittens, Thomas O'Malley.\" That sentence makes Thomas leap in the air with joy. Literally, he jumps about five feet in the air before returning to the ground and nuzzling his mate's face. \"Duchess, baby, you have just made me the happiest cat in Paris,\" he reveals, his yellow eyes filling up with tears. \"No, scratch that. I'm the happiest cat in the world,\" Thomas amends, licking Duchess' cheek as he stares into her blue eyes. \"I'm glad you're excited, Thomas,\" Duchess remarks, starting for the edge of the roof to head back into the room the kittens should be asleep in. \"Well, let's go wake up our little valentines,\" she continues. \"Wait just a minute, Duchess. Let the kids sleep,\" Thomas remarks, which makes Marie breathe a sigh of relief. If Duchess had gone into the bedroom and realized the kittens weren't there… Marie would rather not think of the result of that scenario. \"Why, Thomas? We had family plans for today.\" \" 'Cause, baby, I want more time with you before they wake up. How does a walk past the Eifel Tower sound?\" \"I'd say it sounds purrfect, my love. Besides, you're right. The children will be okay while we're gone. After all, how much trouble can they get in to while they're asleep?\" Little do the two cats know that their kittens are waiting on the roof, watching the whole scene. With that, Duchess and Thomas walk towards the edge of the roof before using the trees to reach the sidewalk with ease. \"How romantic,\" Marie happily says, her heart soaring at seeing her mother and father so happy. \"Yeah, whatever. Let's just go back inside,\" Berlioz says, not wanting to admit he actually doesn't mind his mother and father's affection for one another.

Aristocats is a really beautiful movie, so I hate to see it so underrated in the Fanfiction world. :[ All I need is you by my side *Ding Dong, Ding Dong* The clock eventually struck nine o' clock and Madame Adelaide sighed in relief. It was finally bed time. They had been padding around Paris all day—trying to prove to Thomas (Duchess's new mate and the male cat of the family), that he was safe and sound and no longer had to worry about doing things on his own. He had been promoted to life on a cushion, and at the same time, he was unlocked from his cage of worry. He hadn't been willing to let go of his befriended family, especially Duchess. They had all become something to him, and all he consulted was to spend his life with them—and become a father figure to Duchess's kittens. Madame Adelaide ran her discerning, ravishing fingers over Thomas's head, forcing a slight purr to slip out of his throat. The cat-lover smiled brightly. \"I'm glad you've adjusted to this family, Thomas,\" she gladly shared. \"A male cat is all we need in our household.\" Suddenly, the madame felt a slight tug on the rear of her lavender-coloured dress, stressing two little kittens—ginger and black—who were Duchess's male kittens. They pulled their faces, revealing a rather jealous emotion that tensed up their inside. What about them? Didn't she want them, too? Duchess shot both of her kittens a glare. A short act of discipline and display of disappointment. The scolding mother wore a look: Can you be any ruder? Before the boys could react, they were scooped up by the madame, who released her bright smile again. She tickled them each on the nose; chuckling as they both sneezed afterwards. \"And of course, we need you kittens, too! How can we not?\" Another wave of jealousy came from Marie. She rapidly galloped up to the madame's feet, pouncing into her arms and nuzzling her chest. With all three kittens in her arms, Madame Adelaide rocked them gently—knowing they slept quicker that way. Duchess sauntered up to her new husband, nuzzling up to him and affection and wearing a big smile that showed him she was happy to be with him. Small purrs slipped both of their throat. Thomas hadn't regretted even once to saving them from that pesky servant. In fact, his bravery resulted in a new home and family—one that he loved to bits. Bursting his cloud of thoughts, Duchess stuffed her soft and furry head under her mate's chin, mumbling something afterwards. \"Hm?\" Was Thomas's word that displayed some confusion. \"What did you say, Fluffy?\" He had nicknamed her Fluffy—such an affectionate name! \"You know I love you, right?\" she said with some concern. \"Why, of course!\" Thomas exclaimed, pulling away from her in surprise. \"I love you, too!\" Duchess nodded slowly. \"Oh... It's just...\" Thomas hurried her a little. \"C'mon, Fluffy,\" he hurried. \"What's bothering you?\" \"Before we were captured, it seemed as if I didn't want you to live with us,\" she replied. \"I seemed... rude. It was bothering me that I 'pushed' you out of the door when we were bidding our goodbyes before you saved us.\" Thomas hesitated. She was really sweet for thinking that. But it was quite offensive as to what she had done. That didn't matter anymore, though. She had owed him by becoming his mate and living with them. He had forgiven her long ago. And he knew she didn't mean to do such a thing. \"Oh, Duchess,\" he started. \"I have forgiven you a long time ago. And it's not like you meant to do it. You have apologised to me by allowing me to become your mate and live with you!\" Duchess smiled slightly. \"You really are a sweet cat,\" she complimented, blushing. She found herself putting her head down since she was so shy. Thomas shook his head and used his finger tip to bring her chin up. \"And you are a sweet Duchess,\" he replied back with the same gentleness and softness. \"But, you don't have to be shy of your mate.\" \"I don't want to sleep yet,\" Duchess said quietly after a few moments of silents. Both of them gazed at the minimised moon, tucked in a large blue sky, congested and layered with blankets of stars. \"Me neither,\" Thomas agreed, erecting onto his paws. \"Let's go on a walk.\" Duchess and Thomas strolled through the beautiful city, Paris, in complete love and happiness. The two felines couldn't help but beam at each other—Thomas especially. They skipped through many restaurants; meals catching their eyes and other cats that remained in baskets underneath the tables. Duchess sighed. \"My, that does look quite satisfying,\" she told Thomas. \"Satisfying? What do you mean?\" It seemed the alley cat was getting the wrong idea. Duchess chuckled, still blushing. \"Oh, no, Thomas!\" She exclaimed through laughs. \"I mean the croissants! The last time I had one was a few moons ago.\" She instantly added. \"But I see what you mean. I... Um... I wouldn't mind being so passionate with you.\" Thomas flushed with embarrassment. \"Uhh... You really think that—\" \"Why, of course! You're my mate, now. You shouldn't feel so embarrassed!\" Duchess scolded playfully, referencing her words from Thomas's previous sentence. \"And, the kittens are asleep, it's night and we're away from home!\" Thomas shrugged. \"Well, let's get lost in the night.\" Duchess liked the sound of that. Of course, it was her second time—but only in ages. It was the first time in moons that she had exchanged her innocence for a daredevil game such as breeding. And she was sure this one would be passionate and full of love—not extreme and forced upon her like the previous time. Quickly, the parents treaded into the silent and humid forest—which consumed slumbering animals, and the best place for them to get away. Duchess slipped into the bush and watched Thomas struggle in. \"This is your first time?\" Duchess inquired. She gasped once she realised this question was quite personal. \"I'm sorry... I—\" \"No, it isn't.\" Thomas interrupted sadly. Duchess winced. \"Oh,\" she worded. \"I'm sorry for asking something so personal. I'm not being a good mate right now, am I...?\" Thomas shook his head. \"Duchess, darling, you need to stop apologising,\" he said solemnly. \"It's fine to have a bit of curiosity. And, as my mate, you should know everything about.\" Both felines exchanged a warm smile. Madame Adelaide gently swatted the last kitten into her long fingers, holding it up in front of her profile and planting a small kiss on its forehead as if it was her child. Marie blinked, a tiny meow rippled from her throat - triggering her eyes to finally close. \"...And goodnight to you, Marie.\" She placed the kitten in the small kitty-basket with her siblings, pulling the beautiful, red curtains that embroidered the outing of the basket. The old woman looked up out of the window a few inches away from her large king-sized bed, her eyes sparkling to the sound of the glistening stars that symbolised the burning night sky. Another warm smile was drawn across her face. \"I really hope Thomas fits in here at home,\" she told herself. \"Perhaps we'd even have a second generation!\" She chuckled at that. Closing the white curtains that concealed the bedroom for the night, the madame lifted the bottom of her blue night gown, stepping into the bed with her eyes barely opened. She placed her sleep mask over her eyes, sighing in relief as the long day had ended. The sound of mewing cats had transitioned into snoring ones, and soon her own snoring could be heard. \"Marie! Toulouse!\" Berlioz bellowed, loud enough for his slumbering siblings enough to hear, though not so loud that the madame would hear. Marie jerked her eyes open, clearly annoyed that she was disturbed from her slumber. \"Hey, just because I'm the last one to be put to bed, doesn't mean I'm the one who's less sleepy!\" she ranted. Toulouse woke up in a shock, awaiting speech from his twin brother. After what seemed to be a long journey, the kittens were finally atop of the attic window, observing the rolling stars and the intense moon. Finally, Berlioz began his speech. \"I heard the madame say that... there was going to be a second generation!\" he exclaimed, watching as his wo admired siblings sat here with wide eyes. \"I don't know what that means but—\" \"You fool!\" Marie interrupted Toulouse, hitting her paw on the top of his head. \"It means that Thomas and Momma will have kittens!\" \" Kittens? \" Toulouse and Berlioz repeated confusedly in unison. \"Yes, like us!\" Marie seemed to be overjoyed at the news. She stuck out her chest and beamed. \"I'd be a great older sister...\" The ginger and black male kittens looked at each other in what seemed to be confused expressions. \"But... what if... if... we don't get any attention anymore?\" Marie spat in laughter. \"Of course we'll get attention! We always get attention. Besides, what could be better than having little siblings?\" Toulouse added. \"I guess it can be a lot of fun... I can teach them how to paint!\" \"-And play the grand piano!\" Berlioz added excitedly. \"No, that's boring. They should be taught how to sing... with me as their teacher.\" \"Shut up, Marie!\" Berlioz instructed, leaping onto his twin sister, triggering several growls and snarls to ripple from both of their throats. Marie extended a claw, attempting to scratch her brother. \"Kittens!\" it was a familiar voice. Berlioz was held by his nape, and gently placed on the roof. He looked up and blinked. \"Thomas?\" Duchess threw all three kittens a rather disappointed look. \"Shouldn't you be asleep?\" \"Yeah, but well! We found out you're having kittens!\" Marie exclaimed elatedly. Duchess and Thomas looked at each other chuckling, allowing the kittens to sink in disappointment. \"Oh, keep dreaming, Marie,\" Duchess replied, still chuckling. Both adult cats barged the youngster's by their rear. \"Off to bed now, you three.\" It only took a second before Toulouse noticed that Duchess and Thomas beamed at each other...

At least, no one that I've met, anyway. So I had to change that. I tried to make things as fitting as possible, so I hope you enjoy. Make sure to review! Cheers! ~Ice. Magic Carpets and Sapphires The name \"Bonfamille\" was one that was particularly revered in Paris. You could ask anyone who knew their way around those of higher status, and it was a rare chance that they would not have even heard of Madam Adeline Bonfamille, a formal, elegant woman well into her seventies who owned one of the grandest mansions in all of France, and perhaps the largest fortune. Madam Bonfamille had one daughter by the name of Aimée, and a true treasure she was. An arrival late in Madam's life, she was still young, not quite twenty five, and to many she was one of the most beautiful women in all of Paris. She was a pale, slender figure with a head of long, blonde hair and deep blue eyes. Aimée was not all for show however, and was a rather intelligent woman. She could not be fooled easily, and though many men were desperate for her hand, she would take none of them. As she kindly told them each time, she wanted a man who appreciated her for who she was, not by what she looked like. She had learnt her lesson from the first time she had loved. Aimée had been married a few years ago, and the result of it was three children, all triplets who were just turning five. Sadly the father had left Aimée before they were even a year old, and she had been raising them in her mother's estate ever since. It was a tale she didn't care to retell often, and so far, she hadn't needed to. But she was happy, and that was all that really mattered to her. Aimée loved her children dearly. She had two boys, Toulouse and Berlioz, and a daughter, Marie. Madam also loved them, and she enjoyed having children to run around the large mansion. It filled the emptiness one always felt when in that house alone. It was a warm morning on the fifteenth of July, 1910, when Madam, Aimée, and the children returned home to the mansion with a parcel. Aimée had no idea what was in it, but Madam certainly did, and she wasn't any closer to telling her at the present moment. The butler, Edgar Balthazar, pulled the carriage to a stop, and walked around to help Madam out, then Aimée, who was on the other side. 'Thank you, Edgar,' they both said graciously, and the man gave a small bow. 'Madam, may I take your parcel?' he asked. 'Madam, it really is much too heavy for you, Madam.' Aimée had noted a long time ago that he tended to use the term 'Madam' in almost every sentence when addressing the older woman. Secretly she found it rather amusing. 'Now, tut tut, Edgar,' Madam said, shaking her head and walking to the front door. 'Don't fuss over me.' Marie had already come to Aimée's side, but Toulouse and Berlioz were playing with the horse, running in, around and behind her hooves. 'Berlioz, come back here,' Aimée said, a small smile tugging on the corners of her lips. 'You as well, Toulouse.' 'Come along, Aimée, children,' Madam called as she disappeared through the doorway. 'Come along.' She looked back around the frame of the door at Edgar, who had just positioned himself outside of it. 'Oh, and Edgar, I'm expecting my attorney, Georges Hautecourt. You'll remember him, of course.' With that, she went back inside. 'Of course, Madam,' Edgar said, even though she couldn't possibly have heard him. Aimée however, was there long enough to. 'How could anyone forget him?' He looked mildly amused at the thought. Aimée did remember what had happened last time. The butler's attempts to assist Georges had been nothing but disastrous. 'Come, children,' Aimée said, ushering them inside. 'Let us meet Madam up in the study.' The popping sound of a car exhaust on the street below made Madam and Aimée look up from the books they were reading. 'That would be him now,' Madam said. Aimée crossed the room to the window. 'It is indeed,' she said. 'Poor Edgar will certainly get some entertainment this time.' Madam gave a quiet laugh. 'Oh, Aimée . . .' There was the sound of commotion on the staircase just outside the door that went on for quite some time, and Aimée laughed softly at the endless possibilities that were crossing her mind. With a small smile, Madam set her book aside and lifted a pink feather boa she had sitting across the back of her chair, before draping it over her arms. She then lifted another silvery coloured one out of a cupboard on the other side of the room, and gave it to Aimée. Giving her mother a smile, she also wove it about her arms. Madam looked into a full-length mirror that was sitting nearby, and swayed her arms a little, causing the feathers to flutter from the movement. It looked lovely with her dress. 'There now, Aimée,' she said, carefully touching her hands to her hair and pushing back the stray wisps. 'We both must look our best for Georges.' She pinched her daughter's cheek with a little smile. 'He's our oldest and dearest friend, you know.' 'And a wonderful man, truly,' Aimée added, gently running her fingers over the feathery mass wrapped around her. There was a knock on the set of double doors. At Madam's 'Come in!' they were pushed open, and, breathing heavily, Edgar slumped against one of them. His clothes were distinctly ruffled, and by the look of it, his suspenders had snapped. Aimée's thought has confirmed when his trousers promptly dropped around his ankles. Hastily pulling them up, Edgar said, 'Announcing . . . Monsieur . . . Georges Hautecourt.' He took another deep breath, and looked quite as though he would like to sit down. Inside hobbled a frail looking old man with a shock of white hair and a walking stick. His legs constantly trembled, and he obviously struggled to walk properly. Aimée knew him for his eccentricities, but also knew he was a very good lawyer. 'Oh, my goodness, Edgar, I know Georges,' Madam said, smiling as the butler attempted to fix himself up. 'Adelaide, my – my dear,' Georges cried, walking straight over to Aimée. 'So good to see you, Georges,' Madam said, watching the old man, who kissed Aimée's hand, obviously under the false impression that she was her mother. 'Ah, still the softest hands in all of Paris, eh?' he said, as Aimée put her fingertips to her lips and giggled slightly. 'You're a shameless flatterer, Georges,' Madam said, laughing. The sound of a record started up as Berlioz started playing with the record player, turning the handle with one hand and riffling through some records with the other. The familiar sound of Habanera rang clear as day throughout the room. 'Adelaide, that's – that's music -' Georges squeezed his eyes tight, listening. '- it's from \"Carmen\", isn't it?' 'That's right,' Madam said, nodding and reaching up to tuck back some of the flyaway strands of hair on Aimée's head. 'It was my favourite rove.' 'Yes, yes, it was the night of your grand premier that we first met, remember?' Madam had formerly been a well-known opera singer, which was one of the reasons she owned such a vast fortune. 'Oh, indeed I do,' Madam said, nodding again and going along with the old man. 'And how we celebrated your success,' he said. 'Champagne, dancing the night away . . . do-do, do, do, do-do, do, do . . .' He hummed along with the tune, dancing in a rather peculiar manner. Both Madam and Aimée swayed along with it, and Georges charged in and caught Madam in a partner dance. It was an amusing sight, because he was so much shorter than her. Berlioz was watching the record spin around and around, putting his hand on the disk but lifting it up just before it got caught under the needle. It was constantly going so fast, that in the end his hand got caught and zipped beneath the arm, halting the record and making it play off-tune. Madam laughed slightly, and sank down onto the grand, velvet-lined wooden seat behind her. 'Just in time,' she said, sounding a little out of breath. 'Ah, Georges, we're just a pair of sentimental, old fools.' Georges was still dancing around with his walking stick, humming: 'ra, ta-ta, te, tum . . .' Madam laughed. 'Now, Georges, do be serious. I've asked you to come here on a very important legal matter.' Georges perked up at the mention of this as Aimée sat on the seat beside her mother. 'Oh, splendid, splendid!' he cried. 'Who d'you want me to sue, eh?' He made his way around the desk in a rather awkward fashion. 'Oh, come now, Georges,' Madam said, a little sterner this time. 'I don't wish you to sue anyone; I simply want to make my will.' She ended this on more of a smiling note, looking at the old man as he sat down in the chair behind the desk and fished a pair of spectacles from inside his coat. 'A will, eh? A will . . .' He also pulled a pen from his coat, and took a clean sheet of paper from off the desk. He finally set the pen to the paper, and looked up. 'Now, then. Who are the beneficiaries?' ' . . . as you know, I have only one daughter, Aimée here, and she has three children of her own . . .' Madam Bomfamille's voice carried up the pipe from the study into the room where Edgar stayed, and he was listening to the conversation as he ironed the coat he had tried so hard to look after. That man really was a senile, old fool. ' . . . naturally, I want them to be always well cared for. Certainly, no one can do this better than my faithful servant, Edgar.' Edgar paused, and lifted the iron away from the coat, listening intently. If this was going where he thought it was . . . 'Edgar?' Georges cried, sounding slightly surprised. Edgar sat down the iron and walked over to the pipe, putting his ear right up against it, so not to miss a single word. 'Adelaide, you mean to say you're leaving a vast fortune to Edgar? Everything you possess? Stocks and bonds? This - this mansion? Your country chateau? Art, treasures, jewels and -' Realisation dawned upon him, and Edgar began to jig out of excitement. Things were finally going right at last . . . 'Oh, no, no, Georges,' Madam said, 'to my daughter and her children, of course.' Edgar froze, and a sinking feeling flowed through him. Oh dear . . . 'To all descendants?' Georges said, asking for confirmation. 'Yes, Georges,' Madam said. Edgar sat down on the bed, feeling horribly disappointed. 'I simply wish that I have Aimée inherit first,' Madam said, 'then her children, and if they produce heirs of their own, their children. If however, this doesn't happen for whatever reason, my entire estate will revert to Edgar.' 'It's not fair,' Edgar said indignantly, standing up abruptly and smacking his head on the pipe. 'I mean, each of them will live to about eighty, I can't wait , and there are four of them – that makes . . .' He tried to count it up on his fingers but ended up giving up. 'But anyway, that's much longer than I'd ever live.' He picked up the pair of trousers he had just mended, and clutched them to his chest. 'I'll be gone,' he said in despair. After a moment's thought, it hit him. 'No, oh no . . . they'll be gone. I'll think of a way.' He started to pull his trousers on. 'Why, there are millions of reasons why I should! All of them dollars. Millions .' He gave himself a firm nod. 'Those inheritors have got to go.' With one, final effort, he tried to pull on his trousers and tore them straight down the middle. Three children sprinted up the path towards the mansion late that afternoon, hustling to get to the door first. 'Wait for me, wait for me!' black haired Berlioz shouted, hurrying to catch up with his brother, who was in the lead. 'Me first, me first!' little, blonde Marie cried as they all turned and ran up the steps. The red headed boy, Toulouse, tried to run through the doorway first, but Berlioz stepped on his heel and all three of them piled up in the doorway. 'Why should you be first?' Toulouse asked his sister indignantly. 'Because I'm a lady , that's why,' Marie huffed, her hair slipping out of the braid it had been woven into. 'Aha, you're not a lady,' Toulouse said as Marie climbed off the pile-up first. 'You're nothin' but a sister,' Berlioz said, grabbing her by the hem of her dress and pulling her back. Marie made a noise that said she was very put-off as she slid backwards into the doorway, and Berlioz hopped over her. She sniffed haughtily as both of her brothers took off. ' I'll show you if I'm a lady or not.' With that, she got up with a squeal and chased after them, all the way up into the piano parlouir upstairs. The three of them fought and roughhoused, and when Marie tackled Berlioz, he said, 'Hey, fight fair, Marie.' 'Females never fight fair!' Toulouse announced, balancing atop a chair and waving about a candlestick. He dropped it, and it landed on Marie's head, splitting in two. 'Ouch, now that hurt!' Marie shouted. 'Mamma, mamma!' 'Marie, darling, you must stop that,' Aimée said as she came through the doorway, smiling, but shaking her head at her daughter. 'It is really not ladylike. And Berlioz,' she said as he shook bits of wax out of his hair, 'such behaviour is most unbecoming to a lovely gentleman.' 'Well, she started it,' Berlioz huffed. 'Ladies do not start fights,' Marie said, primping herself and closing her eyes, 'but they can finish them.' She shot her brother a sharp look. Berlioz poked his tongue at her. 'Berlioz, don't be rude,' Aimée said. 'We were just practicing fighting,' Berlioz said innocently. Aimée just shook her head, smiling a little and straightening Marie's braid. 'Aristocrats do not practise fighting and things like that; it's just horrible! ' 'But someday,' Toulouse said, jumping down from the chair, 'we might meet a tough guy in the streets.' He punched the air for extra effect. Aimée laughed a little. 'Now that will do. It's time we concerned ourselves with self-improvement. Now, you want to grow up to be lovely, charming ladies and gentlemen – Toulouse, you go and start on with your painting.' 'Yes, mamma,' Toulouse said meekly. He punched the air a few more times on the way to his easel on the other side of the room. 'Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint before we start our music lesson?' Marie asked as Toulouse began squirting tubes of paint onto a palette and mixing them. 'Please?' Aimée gave a nod of consent. 'Well, yes my love, but you must be very quiet.' Doing his best to look professional, Toulouse put his brush in the big, messy glob of paint on the palette and began smearing it on to the canvas. It looked like a collection of blobs at first, but over time it came to resemble something that looked remotely like a face. He gave it a green and orange background, and for the final touches, splattered some red in the middle of the face. 'It's Edgar!' Marie cried, making the connection. 'Old picklepuss Edgar!' Berlioz added. Aimée couldn't help herself. She laughed a little, and made vain attempts to stifle it in her hand. '\"Old Picklepuss\"? Now, now, Berlioz,' she said, trying to be stern as her son was almost rolling around on the floor in laughter, 'that is not kind. You know Edgar is so fond of all of us, and takes very good care of us.' In the kitchen, Edgar was preparing the food to be sent out for that night's meal. The cook had left not two minutes earlier, and he already had the bottle of sleeping pills clutched tightly in his hand, and was uncapping it. He tipped almost the entire bottle into a bowl and crushed them up into a fine powder, before tipping it into both Aimée's and the children's bowls of soup. 'Oh, Edgar, you sly old fox,' he said to himself. He stirred them up and added a bit of cream to disguise the taste, and was just lifting the spoon to his lips to test it before he stopped himself. 'Oops, oh dear,' he muttered, pushing the spoon away with his other hand. 'Slip of the hand and off to dreamland.' He went back to stirring the soups. 'I say,' he said after a moment's thought, 'that's not at all bad – slip of the hand, dreamland . . .' Aimée looked up as the door to the piano parlour opened, and Edgar stepped inside. 'Good evening, Ms Bonfamille,' he said politely, addressing Aimée. 'Dinner is served, if you would like to come down to the dining room.' The children could not have gotten out the door any faster. Within moments of Edgar announcing that, Toulouse had abandoned his painting, Berlioz, who was playing the piano, cut off mid-song, and Marie instantly stopped singing. They ran out the door and disappeared instantly. With a soft laugh, Aimée gave a polite nod to Edgar, and followed them. They met Madam down in the dining room, and were greeted by steaming bowls of hot soup, ready to be eaten. Dinner was a pleasant affair, as it always was, and the soup was quite nice. By the end of it however, the children were clearly quite tired, and Aimée herself was feeling rather dull and fuzzy in the mind. 'I, I think I'm going to go to bed,' Marie said quietly. 'Good night, Mamma. Good night, Madam.' She slid off her seat and left the room. 'I think they are all tired,' Aimée said, laughing quietly as Toulouse and Berlioz yawned rather audibly. 'I think I shall put them to bed, Madam.' 'I believe you should, too,' Madam said with a smile. With a quiet, 'Come along, children,' Aimée took her sons by the hands and led them upstairs to the room that the triplets shared, before tucking them both into bed. Deciding that she too, would benefit from a sleep, Aimée then crossed the hall, but didn't really have the time to consider changing into a nightdress before she collapsed into her own bed, falling asleep almost instantly. It was nearing midnight when Edgar cautiously crept out of the house, Aimée Bonfamille held in his arms as he looked around to ensure no one was nearby. Feeling satisfied at that, he walked over to his motorcycle parked nearby, and slid her into the sidecar. He then returned inside, where he had left the children, all curled together right on the doormat. They hopefully wouldn't take up much space, and would all fit. Sure enough, that sidecar must have been built for the largest of people, so he managed to fit them all in without difficulty. None of them woke up, as they were still heavily drugged from the medication. He got onto the motorbike and started it up, driving out onto the half-lit, cobblestone streets of Paris. He narrowly avoided driving straight past the police station, and had to turn around and take a different path. He was far too nervous about this – too many things could go wrong. It was several hours before he was out driving through the countryside, aiming to get as far away as possible. They couldn't be able to find their way back to Paris before they hopefully died from a lack of nourishment, or something just as grim. Though when he heard barking, Edgar panicked a little. Dogs loved to chase motorbikes, and he doubted he would be an exception in any case. The barking drew steadily closer, and before Edgar knew it, he had two dogs on his tail, running as fast as he drove. When one of them took a leap and latched onto his back, Edgar veered violently, driving straight down to a riverbank. The sidecar snapped off, and the Bonfamilles all tumbled out, getting lost among the long grass and reeds. But Edgar didn't have time to retrieve them – here would have to do. Desperately needing to get away from the dogs, he drove off. Aimée awoke to the sound of thunder rather abruptly. She looked up, blinking as lightning struck somewhere and temporarily made everything go rather bright. 'Oh!' she cried, as she realised something. She wasn't in the mansion at all. She was outside, in a place she didn't know. 'Children, where are you?' she cried, getting unsteadily to her feet and looking around. 'Answer me! Berlioz? Toulouse, Marie, where are you?' 'Here I am, Mamma,' came Marie's tiny voice as she crawled out from between some reeds. Aimée hurried forward and drew her close. 'Marie, darling. Are – are you alright?' 'I – I guess I had a nightmare and fell out of bed,' she murmured sleepily, apparently unable to see properly just yet. 'Now, now, Marie, darling, don't be frightened -' Aimée started, but she was cut off by someone calling out. 'Mamma, Mamma!' 'That's Berlioz!' Marie said. 'Over here, darling, Berlioz, here we are!' Aimée called, looking around, starting down into the river. 'And don't worry, everything is going to be alright . . .' Cold and shivering, Berlioz started dragging himself towards the shore, out of the water. 'I'm coming, Mamma,' he said, his voice pitifully quiet and afraid. He paused as he looked at something Aimée couldn't quite see. Then there was a loud croaking, and Berlioz screamed, dashing up out of the water and over to his mother. 'Oh, darling,' Aimée murmured, laughing slightly. 'That's only a little frog, my love.' 'But he had a mouth like a hippolotamus,' Berlioz insisted. He reeled backwards as he heard more frogs croaking in the distance, and Marie giggled. Berlioz glared at her. 'Oh, what's so funny?' 'Now, darlings, just stay here,' Aimée said, before any fighting could start, 'and I'll go look for Toulouse.' She walked away, looking around and calling her son's name. She hadn't gotten very far before she had Marie calling her back again, insisting that he had been there the entire time. 'Oh, thank goodness,' Aimée murmured, drawing her son into a hug. 'Are you alright?' 'I was having a funny dream,' Toulouse said quietly. 'Edgar was in it.' He stopped and frowned. 'And we were all riding and bouncing along . . .' He paused as he heard frogs croaking. ' Frogs? Uh oh. It wasn't a dream. Edgar did this to us.' 'Edgar?' Aimée asked, feeling slightly shocked at her son's accusations. 'Oh, no, no, darling, why that . . . why that's ridiculous.' Berlioz grinned. 'Yeah. Maybe you fell on your head, Toulouse.' Lighting flashed again, and Marie backed up, straight into Aimée. 'Mamma, I'm afraid. I wanna go home.' 'Oh, now, darling, don't be frightened -' Aimée started soothingly, but a crash of thunder incredibly close to them made her cut off and scream a little. 'Oh, okay now, get under the bridge, all of us.' Aimée ushered her children under the stone bridge nearby as rain started falling heavily. 'What's gonna happen to us?' Toulouse asked, sounding forlorn. 'I just don't know,' Aimée murmured. 'It does look hopeless, doesn't it?' 'I wish we were home with Madam right now.' 'Oh, poor Madam,' Aimée said quietly, sitting down in the grass beneath the bridge and drawing all of her children into a hug. 'She'll be so worried when she finds us gone . . .' The sound of thunder woke Adelaide Bonfamille that night, and she rose, her mind on her daughter and grandchildren. 'Oh my gracious,' she murmured. She had the most horrible dream about them. 'Thank goodness it was only a dream.' She left her bedroom and walked down the hallway. She knew how much the children hated thunderstorms. 'Now, now, my darlings,' she said as she pushed open the door to the children's bedroom, 'don't be frightened, the storm will soon pass -' She broke off suddenly as she took in the empty beds before her. 'Oh no,' she said faintly. 'They're gone.' She hurried out and went into Aimée's room. Upon seeing her daughter's also empty bed, the panic fully began to set in. 'Aimée!' she cried. 'Children! Aimée! Where are you?' The next morning when Roquefort the paper boy arrived, a good friend of the Bonfamilles, Adelaide informed him in despair of their disappearance. The seventeen year old all but dropped the papers on Adelaide's doorstep and took off almost immediately to search. Adelaide however, feared it would all be in vain. The storm had cleared up when Aimée awoke the next morning, and when it wasn't dark, she came to realise that the bank was really a lovely place. The children were still asleep beneath the bridge, so she stepped out into the sunshine, not caring in the slightest that she was still a little damp, and most likely looked a mess. What caught her by surprise though, was when she heard singing. A man singing, to be precise. ' . . . I'm Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley . . .' There, walking along the other side of the river, was a handsome, red haired man wearing a checked shirt with his hands in his trouser pockets. 'I've got that wanderlust, gotta walk the scene. Gotta kick up highway dust, feel the grass that's green.' He reached the bridge and turned onto it, coming closer to Aimée. 'Gotta strut them city streets . . .' He suddenly looked down over the edge of the bridge and spotted Aimée. A grin crossed his features. 'Showin' off my eclat, yeah! Tellin' my friends of the social elite, or some cute gal I happen to meet, that I'm Abraham de Lacy Guiseppe Case Thomas O'Malley, O'Malley the \"alley cat\"!' He stepped lightly off the bridge and plucked a blossom from a tree just beside Aimée, and put it in her hair. Aimée laughed lightly. 'Why, monsieur, your name seems to cover all of Europe.' 'Of course,' the man said. 'I'm the only man of my kind.' 'And certainly not a cat,' Aimée said amusedly. 'I'm king of the highway, prince of the boulevard, duke of the avant-garde - the world is my backyard. So if you're goin' my way, that's the road you wanna seek. Calcutta to Rome or home sweet home - in Paris, magnifique, you all.' Aimée quirked a smile, and suddenly feeling a little self-conscious, worked to straighten her hair. 'I only got myself and this big old world, but I sip that cup of life with my fingers curled. I don't worry what road to take, I don't have to think of that. Whatever I take is the road I make. It's the road of life, make no mistake for me. Yeah, Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley. O'Malley the \"alley cat\"!' He gave her a nod. 'That's right, and I'm very proud of that. Yeah!' Aimée laughed, and clapped her hands together. 'Bravo! Very good – you are a great talent!' 'Oh, thank you,' Thomas said modestly, but she could see laughter twinkling behind his eyes. 'And what might your name be?' 'My name is Aimée,' she said. 'Aimée,' he repeated. 'Beautiful. Love it. And those eyes . . .' He leaned forward a little, still smiling at her. 'Why, your eyes are like sapphires, sparkling so bright,' he said, straightening up and giving her a nod. An obvious flirt, but for once Aimée didn't mind. 'They make the morning radiant , and light.' He started walking around her, his hands clasped behind his back. 'Oh, c'est tres jolie, monsieur,' Aimée said. 'Very poetic. But it is not quite Shakespeare.' ''Course not,' he said. 'That's pure O'Malley, baby. Right off the cuff, yeah. I got a million of 'em.' 'Oh, no more, please,' Aimée said. 'I really am in a great deal of trouble.' 'Trouble?' Thomas repeated. 'Helping beautiful dame – uh, damsels in distress is my specialty. Now what's the hang-up, Your Ladyship?' 'Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris,' Aimée said. 'So if you would be just so kind and show me the way?' 'Show you the way?' Thomas said, grinning broadly. 'Perish the thought. We shall fly to Paris on a magic carpet, side by side.' He gestured out towards the sky, leaning his head in toward hers. 'With the stars as our guide.' Just behind him, Aimée could see that Marie had woken, and was approaching O'Malley with a look of interest and excitement. 'Just we two,' Thomas finished. 'Ooh, that would be wonderful ,' Marie said sweetly, looking up at O'Malley. He stiffened a little and turned to look at her in slight shock. 'Three?' Then Berlioz appeared and hurried to stand beside his sister. 'Four?' Finally Toulouse joined the group. ' Five?' 'Oh, yes, monsieur O'Malley, these are my children.' 'Oh, how sweet,' he said, but his smile then seemed slightly forced. 'Do you really have a magic carpet?' Berlioz asked eagerly. 'And are we really gonna ride on it?' Marie finished. 'Now, now, Marie,' Aimée said with a little smile. 'Mamma,' Marie asked, 'do I have sparkling sapphire eyes that dazzle too?' She shot a childish smile at Thomas. 'Oh, did I say that?' he asked, suddenly looking rather embarrassed. 'Yes,' Aimée said, rather enjoying this. 'Right off your cuff.' 'And you said we're gonna ride on your magic carpet,' Berlioz said pointedly. 'Well, now, uh . . . well I meant, you see, I -' He looked at Aimée imploringly. 'No poetry to cover this situation, monsieur O'Malley?' she asked teasingly. 'Well, what I had in mind was kind of a sports model, baby,' he said. 'You know, one of those -' 'Perhaps a magic carpet built for two?' 'I wouldn't take up much room,' Marie said sweetly. Aimée sighed. 'I understand perfectly, monsieur O'Malley. Well . . . come along darlings.' She gestured out to her children, and they started to follow her. As he passed him, Toulouse said, 'I'm a tough guy too.' He punched at the air again in demonstration. 'Hey there,' Thomas said, starting to grin a little again. 'You're comin' on. I bet you're a real tiger in your neighbourhood.' 'Yeah,' Toulouse said. 'That's cuz I practise all the time.' 'Now, now, Toulouse, come along, dear,' Aimée called. They had just reached the top of the slight hill where the bridge ended. 'Yes, mamma,' Toulouse said, turning back around to follow her. 'See ya 'round, tiger,' Thomas called after him. Aimée did feel a rather unpleasant sense of disappointment. She really had been hoping he would be of some help . . . They were walking away when he called after them. 'Hey, hey, wait up there.' Aimée turned, hope flaring up in her chest. 'Yes, monsieur O'Malley?' 'Now, look, kids,' he said, leaning down to them. 'If I said magic carpet, then magic carpet it's gonna be. And it's gonna stop for passengers right . . .' He turned to look at the dirt road around them, before walking away a little and drawing an X in the dirt with his boot. 'Here.' 'Oh boy, we're gonna fly after all,' Berlioz said excitedly. 'Another flight into the fantasy, monsieur O'Malley?' Aimée asked, smiling a little. 'No, no, no, baby,' he said, shaking his head. 'Now you just hide over there, and you leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley.' He jumped and grabbed a thick branch on the tree above them, before hauling himself up in among the leaves. 'Quick, mum, get in here,' Toulouse said, dragging her to a clump of long grass. 'But, children -' 'Hurry up, mamma, hurry,' the three of them insisted, and next thing Aimée knew, she was hiding amongst the grass with her children. A cattle truck was puttering down the road towards them, which was possibly the only vehicle that ever used this road. The man driving it didn't look friendly in the slightest. Aimée could see Thomas up in the tree, watching it as though it were his prey. 'One magic carpet comin' up,' he called down to them, a grin more than evident on his face. Aimée wondered with dread what he had in mind. 'That's a magic carpet?' she whispered faintly, right before Thomas leapt off the branch with the grace of a cat, straight onto the bonnet of the truck. 'Sacre bleu!' Aimée heard the driver scream, as Thomas bounced off the truck and dove into the long grass on the other side of the road, tumbling down the slope and disappearing from sight. The truck swerved violently and coughed to a stop as the man evidently stamped on the brakes. 'Sapristi!' he shouted, waving his fist at the air around him as he walked over to restart the car. 'Stupid man! Brainless lunatic!' As he busied himself with winding the car up again, Thomas strolled back up the hill, just out of his sight. 'All right, step lively!' he said quietly, his eyes twinkling with amusement. 'All aboard for Paris!' The children scrambled into the back, but Aimée approached him, feeling more than a little worried. 'Why, Mister O'Malley, you could have lost your life,' she murmured. Thomas waved her off, but he seemed pleased at the concern she was showing. 'So I got a few to spare,' he said lightly. 'It's nothin'.' 'How can we ever thank you?' she asked as she climbed up into the back of the truck. 'My pleasure, entirely,' he said with a modest nod. With a loud splutter, the truck started, beginning its trip once again, albeit very loudly. 'Aloha,' Thomas called over the noise, so they could just hear him. 'Auf weidersehen. Bon soir. Saranora. And all those goodbye things, baby.' Marie leaned towards the edge of the truck and waved. 'Sayonara, Mister – oh!' Marie tumbled over the edge of the truck and into the dirt. Some of the cows jerked violently at the noise she made, and Aimée let out a cry of panic as the truck started gathering speed. 'Marie! Marie!' In an instant Thomas was running forward and scooping her up, now already chasing the truck. With a gigantic leap he managed to deposit the girl on the back of the truck, but ended up desperately hanging on to the back in an attempt to keep himself up. 'Oh, Marie, are you alright?' Aimée asked. Marie gave a little nod. 'Yes, mamma.' With a bit of a groan, Thomas hauled himself up so his head rose up high enough to see them. 'Haven't we met before?' he asked jokingly. 'And I'm so very glad we did,' Aimée said with a small smile. 'Thank you, Mister O'Malley for saving my life,' Marie said sweetly. 'No trouble at all, little princess,' he said, finally pulling himself onto the truck. 'And when we get to Paris, I'll show you the time of your life.' 'Oh, I'm so sorry,' Aimée said a little sadly, 'but, well, we just couldn't.' The children looked at her, rather upset. 'You see,' she continued, 'my mother will be so worried about us.' 'Well, people don't usually worry too much about their kids, especially when they're all grown up,' Thomas said in an attempt to reassure her. 'Oh no,' Aimée said, shaking her head. 'You just don't understand. She loves us very much.' She looked out into the distance, watching trees and fields shrink as they drove past. 'Poor Madam, in that big mansion, all alone. In all our days, in tender ways, her love for us was shown. And so, you see, we can't leave her alone. She'd always say that we're the greatest treasure she could have. Because with us she never felt alone.' 'Oh, Roquefort, I've been so worried about you,' Frou-Frou said. She stepped away from the horse she was grooming and came over to him. 'Did you have any luck at all?' He shook his head sadly. 'Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou. And I've searched all morning.' 'I know,' the stable girl said softly, 'and poor Madam still hasn't slept a wink either.' 'Oh, it's a sad day for all of us,' he said quietly. The sound of joyous humming drew steadily closer to the door, and both under the impression that they really shouldn't be in the stables with the horses just then, dove behind the nearest haystack. 'Morning, my pretty steeds,' Edgar called out to the horses as he marched on in with a bucket in hand. He patted the nearest one on the head, before hesitating and hissing, 'Can you keep a secret?' He laughed to himself. 'Of course you can.' He set the bucket down and pulled a newspaper out of his pocket. 'I've some news straight from the horse's mouth, if you'll pardon the expression, of course.' Both Roquefort and Frou-Frou frowned and looked at each other. 'Look,' he said to the horse, holding up the paper as it unravelled. ' I've made the headlines.' Mysterious Kidnapper Abducts Family. He read out the title rather proudly. He chuckled. 'Oh, aren't you proud of me?' So, he's the kidnapper, Roquefort thought. Anger settled in the bottom of his chest, and it took all of his self-control not to react, and stay hidden. Judging by her expression, Frou-Frou was struggling to do the same. 'The police say it was a \"professional, masterful job\",' Edgar continued, puffing out his chest. '\"The work of a genius\". Not bad, eh, old girl?' he said to the horse, smacking it on the rump with the now rolled up newspaper. The horse whinnied, startled and alarmed, and chuckling, Edgar walked out. The truck puttered through the countryside, and looking out over the view, Thomas said suddenly, 'Anyone for breakfast?' 'What breakfast?' Toulouse asked excitedly. 'Where is it?' Marie said. 'Right under that magic carpet,' Thomas said, gesturing to a tarp that Aimée knew was covering a few tins of cream from the cows around them. 'But now we have to cook up a little spell. You know.' The children looked at each other excitedly. 'Ready?' They all nodded. 'Alright. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose.' They all did just that. 'And tickle your chin.' Once again, they did as he said. 'Then you close your eyes, and cross your heart . . . then presto, breakfast, al la carte!' He lifted up the tarp quickly, and the lid came off one of the pails, revealing the cream inside. 'Hooray!' Marie cheered. 'We did it!' said Toulouse. 'Look, mamma, look!' Berlioz cried. The three of them were more than eager to scoop the cream out of the tin with their hands. 'Why, Mister O'Malley, you are amazing,' Aimée said, even though she felt a little guilty they were stealing this man's cream. 'True,' Thomas said with a little more than a modest nod. 'True.' There was a sudden cry of 'Sapristi!' and the truck slammed to a stop suddenly. 'Sacre bleu!' Suddenly alarmed, the five of them rushed to get out of the truck, already running off as the driver's voice sounded after them. 'Thieves! Robbers! Mangy tramps!' They hurried over a railway track and into a wooden building. 'Oh,' said Aimée, feeling horrified as she watched the truck drive away. 'What a horrible, horrible man!' 'Well, some people are like that, Aimée,' Thomas said. 'I've learned to live with them.' 'I'll show him,' Toulouse said grumpily, punching the air in the direction of the quickly disappearing cattle truck. 'Hey, cool it, you little tiger,' Thomas said. 'That guy's dynamite.' 'But he called us tramps!' Toulouse said indignantly. 'Oh, I'll be so glad when we get back home,' Aimée said, shaking her head. 'Well, that's a long way off, so we better get movin',' Thomas said. The children ran over to the railway track, which extended over the water and over the land on the other side. 'Gee whiz,' Toulouse said. 'Look at that bridge. Come on, let's play train.' The three of them got into a line on the track. 'Now, be careful, children,' Aimée called. 'Marie's the caboose,' Toulouse said. Marie gave him a look. 'All aboard!' Then the three of them were shuffling along, with Toulouse making train noises as the front. Aimée and Thomas followed behind. Toulouse was still making train noises. 'Woo, woo!' HONK, HONK! The five of them looked up in alarm as they saw a train charging down the track toward them. 'Oh no!' Aimée cried. 'Alright now, don't panic,' Thomas said quickly, and the five of them swung down the wooden support beams onto the framework below the train. It was a terrifying moment as that heavy piece of machinery thundered over them. When it finally passed, Aimée and Thomas looked up through the track to see the train already disappearing in the distance. There was a splashing noise from a long way below, and a strangled cry of, 'Mamma!' Marie was floundering about in the fast-moving current below, struggling to stay above the water. 'Marie!' Aimée shouted, leaning over the edge of a beam. 'Keep your head up, Marie!' Thomas shouted. 'Here I come!' Before Aimée could register what was going on, he had leapt off the track supports and dove into the water. It was a long, horrible few seconds before he surfaced and paddled over to Marie, grabbing her by the arm and swimming over to a floating log. Aimée herself was already climbing down the supports, Toulouse and Berlioz following quickly behind, and running along the rocks beside the river, hurrying to catch up to them. Thomas scrabbled to hold onto both Marie and the log, losing grip occasionally and punting the bit of wood a few feet away from him before being able to grab it again. Aimée had overtaken them now, and was making her way across a branch that hung over the river. 'Thomas!' she called. 'Thomas, up here!' Moments before the log was swept past her, he got enough of a grip on Marie to toss her up to Aimée, who staggered slightly on the sudden weight and nearly fell in for herself. Toulouse and Berlioz had only just finished climbing down the train track and were now hurrying to catch up to them as Aimée set a cold and shivering Marie down on the ground. 'Gee, Marie,' Aimée heard Toulouse say as she took off after Thomas. 'Why did'ja have to fall off the bridge?' 'Thomas!' Aimée called, hurrying along the edge of the river. 'Oh, Thomas, take care!' 'I'm alright, honey, don't worry!' he called back, still attempting to successfully cling to the log as it rushed further and further away from her. 'I'll see ya downstream!' Then he disappeared behind a clump of trees that were hanging over the water. Floundering around in water was something O'Malley hated the most. He couldn't swim. Not that it was a fact that he went around openly admitting, but it was true. He bobbed and struggled with the log when the sound of girlish laughter filled his ears. He quite pointedly ignored it, before grabbing an opportunity to leap off the log and grab onto a willow branch. Keeping a firm hold on it, he started with great, frog-like movements in an attempt to reach the shore. 'Sir, sir!' someone suddenly called out. Sparing a look up, O'Malley saw two women standing on the shore; one in a pink bonnet, one in a blue. Pink Bonnet was the one talking to him. 'You are most fortunate we happened along,' she said, her accent distinctly British. 'Yes,' Blue Bonnet said. 'We are here to help you. We're professional swimmers, you know.' 'Oh, no,' O'Malley groaned. 'Back off, girls, I'm doing fine!' But the bonnet-heads were navigating their way over to him, over rocks and through reeds, until they were quite happily wading out into the water where he was. They didn't seem to care at all that they were getting their dresses wet. 'First, you must gain self-confidence by striking out on your own,' Blue Bonnet said. 'Go away!' O'Malley insisted. 'I'm tryi'na get to shore!' But they quite promptly ignored him. 'You will never learn to swim properly with that willow branch in your hands,' Pink Bonnet said. 'Indeed,' Blue Bonnet agreed. O'Malley was just starting to back up onto some rocks, and was hoping to be able to push himself towards shore. 'Snip, snip, here we go.' 'Don't do that!' O'Malley yelped, and with that, he tumbled further downstream, floundering and falling further beneath the water. 'You're doing splendidly ,' Blue Bonnet said. 'And don't worry about form,' Pink Bonnet added, 'it will come later.' They both weren't bothered in the slightest that O'Malley was very close to drowning. He heard the final comment of 'He takes to water like a fish, doesn't he?' before he went under. In a desperate attempt to surface again, O'Malley grabbed what felt like the hems of the women's dresses, and he heard muffled squawking above, plus some violent movement. At that, he lost his grip and began sinking to the bottom. Abigail and Amelia, both in fits of laughter, began to trail off as they realised that the man had not resurfaced. 'Amelia,' Abigail said, suddenly looking rather worried. 'You don't suppose . . . ?' 'Oh yes,' Amelia replied. 'Yes I do.' They looked at each other before Amelia said, 'Bottoms up!' That was it. He was done for. This was the end of Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley, the \"alley cat\". Ironically, he was drowning. Nicknames were really rotten luck sometimes. Then he felt two sets of hands grab him by either arm and haul him to the surface. Coughing and spluttering, O'Malley found air once again. Slinging his arms over their shoulders, the Bonnet sisters began bringing him to shore. 'You really did quite well for a beginner,' Blue Bonnet told him. But what couldn't have been a more welcome face was Aimée, standing on the shore, looking relieved to see him. 'Oh, Thomas,' she said, hurrying forward to help the ladies deposit him on the ground. 'Thank goodness you're safe.' 'Keep practising,' Blue Bonnet said, smiling and tapping him under the chin. 'And toodlie-pip!' Pink Bonnet finished. O'Malley shook himself free of water and got to his feet, more than disgruntled. Toulouse walked forward. 'Could I help you, Mr O'Malley, huh?' O'Malley just coughed in response, before saying, 'Help? I've had all of the help I can take.' 'Thank you so much for helping Mr O'Malley,' Aimée said, going over to the Bonnet sisters who were just walking away, sopping dresses and all. 'Of course, my dear,' Pink Bonnet said. 'But first, introductions.' Grumbling, O'Malley busied himself with wringing out his shirt. 'Yes,' Blue Bonnet added. 'We British like to keep things proper.' Toulouse and Berlioz looked up at them, slightly shocked at their incessant giggling. 'Now, I am Amelia Gabble,' Pink Bonnet said, 'and this is my sister -' 'Miss Abigail Gabble,' Blue Bonnet finished. 'We're twin sisters.' 'You might say we're related.' They both started laughing again, as though this were a joke they shared often. 'How nice,' Aimée said, laughing with them. 'I never would have guessed.' 'We on holiday,' Abigail said, once they had all finished up their giggling session. 'For a walking tour of France,' her sister added. 'And swimming some of the way.' 'On water, of course.' And, as could be expected, they started laughing again. Aimée however, seemed to be enjoying their company. 'Thomas,' she said, coming up to him as he continued to dry himself out. 'This is Amelia and Abigail Gabble.' 'Yeah, honey,' O'Malley said irritably, 'get those two lifeguards outta here.' 'Now, now, Thomas,' Aimée said, shaking her head a little. 'Okay, okay, baby,' O'Malley muttered. 'Hiya, chicks,' he called over to the bonnet heads. They both burst into giggles again. He just scowled a little. 'We're not chickens,' Abigail, finally said. 'We're ladies.' She said it as though it were quite obvious. ' No ,' O'Malley said, his voice that of mock surprise. 'I thought you were swans.' Aimée looked at him disapprovingly and he immediately regretted that, though the Gabbles didn't seem to mind. 'Oh, flatterer,' Amelia said, putting a hand over her heart. 'Your husband is very charming, and very handsome,' Abigail told Aimée. O'Malley, who was now shaking himself out a bit more, paused. 'Well, you see, I – I'm not exactly her husband,' he put in, after getting over that momentary shock. 'Exactly?' Amelia posed questioningly. 'You either are, or you aren't.' 'Alright,' he said. 'I'm not.' 'Oh?' the sisters said in unison, suddenly looking quite unimpressed by him. They immediately began muttering amongst themselves. 'It's scandalous.' 'He's nothing but a cad.' 'Absolutely, possibly a reprobate.' 'A roue. His eyes are too close together.' 'Shifty, too.' Berlioz came and stood beside him, and O'Malley smirked at him, quite amused by these women's apparent observations. 'And look at that crooked smile.' 'His chin is very weak, too.' 'Obviously a philanderer who trifles with unsuspecting women's hearts.' 'How romantic,' Marie sighed. 'Please, please, let me explain,' Aimée said. 'Thomas is a dear friend of ours. He's just helping us to get to -' 'C'mon, Aimée, come on,' O'Malley muttered, standing by her side and cutting her off. 'Let's get out of here.' He looked up at the Gabble sisters. 'Well, girls, see ya' 'round!' He started walking away. 'We're on our way to Paris.' 'Oh, how nice,' he heard Abigail say. 'We're going to Paris ourselves.' 'Why don't you join us?' Amelia asked. He whirled around. 'I think that's a splendid idea,' Aimée said, smiling pleasantly. 'Oh no . . .' O'Malley muttered. 'When we get to Paris you must meet Uncle Waldo,' Amelia said to the group. 'Waldo?' O'Malley asked incredulously. 'Yes, he's our uncle,' Amelia said again. 'We are to meet Uncle Waldo at Le Petit Café,' Abigail said. 'Le Petit Café,' Aimée repeated. 'Oh, that's that famous restaurant. Ah, c'est magnifique.' It was dark by the time they finally arrived in Paris, and the cobblestone streets were lit up by street lanterns. They were a not far from the café when Abigail said, 'Why – why it's Uncle Waldo!' She pointed to a drunk looking man further up the street wearing a battered top hat and swaying about, using a lamp post to stay upright. He let out a cry of surprise when he looked their way and saw the Gabble sisters. 'Ah! Abigail! Amelia! Ahaha, my two favourite nooses!' 'Uncle Waldo.' Amelia tutted but had a smile on her face. 'I do believe you've been drinking.' 'Girls, it's outrageous,' Uncle Waldo said indignantly. 'Why, you would not believe what they're trying to do to your poor old Uncle Waldo. Look – look at this.' He pointed to the menu on the wall. ' Prime country goose a la provencale, stuffed with chestnuts and basted in white wine.' He hiccupped. 'Basted?' Thomas muttered. 'He's been marinated in it.' 'Ah, yes, Uncle Waldo, he -' Amelia started laughing a little as she tried to explain this to Aimée. 'When he is drunk, he thinks he's a goose.' 'Oh,' Aimée said, smiling in amusement. 'Ah.' 'Dreadful,' Waldo said. 'Being British, I would have preferred . . . sherry.' Both he and the Gabble sisters started laughing at this. He let out a loud cry of 'Sherry!' before falling over and landing on his backside. 'Oh, Uncle Waldo, you're just too much,' Amelia said through laughter. 'You mean he's had too much,' Abigail said in response. There was more laughter. 'Abigail,' Amelia whispered, 'we'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.' 'Why, I say there, now,' Waldo said drunkenly, 'what's all the whis-whispering about, huh?' The sisters tried to shush him, but he continued, 'Now, now, now, now, girls, girls! Don't shush your old Uncle Waldo. Why you'll – you'll wake up the whole neighbourhood!' He was shouting now, and they still attempted to quiet him down. 'Whoopee! Neighbourhood!' 'Oh, Uncle Waldo,' Abigail hissed, grinning broadly. 'Yes, I think we'd better be going,' Amelia said though laugher. They both looped one of their uncle's arms around each of their necks, and walked away laughing and tittering with their drunken relative. 'You know somethin'?' Thomas asked as the rest of them watched them walk away. 'I like Uncle Waldo.' Aimée started laughing again. 'Especially when he's marinated.' Several hours later, they were still walking through Paris, so tired that little Marie was actually on Thomas' shoulders. 'But Thomas,' Aimée murmured, speaking for the first time in a while. 'Madam will be so worried. Are you sure we can't get home tonight?' 'Mamma, I'm tired,' Marie said. 'Me too,' Berlioz added, 'and my feet hurt.' 'Look, baby, it's late and the kids are bushed,' Thomas said quietly. 'I'll bet we walked a hundred miles,' Toulouse said pitifully. 'I'll bet it's more than a thousand,' Berlioz said, sitting down right where he was standing. 'Now, now, darlings, cheer up,' Aimée said. 'Mr O'Malley knows a place where we can stay tonight.' The children all perked up at this. 'How much farther is it, Mr O'Malley?' Toulouse asked. Thomas laughed. 'Keep your head up, tiger,' he said. 'It's just beyond that next street lamp.' Sure enough, they rounded a corner and came out before an old, beaten down house, falling apart at all of the hinges. 'Well, there it is,' Thomas said. 'My own penthouse pad.' Suddenly the sound of a trumpet rang out, clear as day, immediately followed by a variety of other instruments. 'Uh, oh,' Thomas said, suddenly looking rather pleased. 'It looks like Scat Cat and his gang are here.' 'Friends of yours?' Aimée asked, starting to think that these \"cat\" titles were something shared around Thomas and all of his friends. 'Uh huh,' Thomas said. 'Yeah. They're old buddies and they're real swingers.' 'Swingers?' Aimée posed. 'What's a swinger?' 'You know,' Thomas said. 'Uh, not exactly your type, Aimée. Maybe we'd better find another place, huh?' 'Oh no, no, no,' she said, smiling a little. 'I would like to see your pad, and meet your Scat Cat.' 'Well, okay,' Thomas said with a shrug. He pushed open the front door. 'Hey, Scat Cat!' he shouted. 'Blow some of that sweet stuff my way!' 'Well, looky here!' someone called back, from a long way upstairs. 'Big man O'Malley is back in his alley!' 'C'mon,' Thomas said, to them, and led the four of them up several flights of worn down stairs up into a large bedroom. There was a collection of strangely dressed men in there, all with an instrument of some sort. 'Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat!' Thomas called, throwing his hands up in the air and grinning at his friends. They all greeted him enthusiastically, and from what Aimée could tell, they were all from different nations. But Thomas led Aimée straight over to a wide man wearing a black and red bowler hat, saying, 'Aimée, this is the greatest cat of 'em all.' 'Oh, I am delighted to meet you, monsieur Scat Cat,' Aimée said with a smile, trying out the strange nickname. He took her hand and kissed it. 'Likewise, Ms Aimée. You are too much.' 'You are so charming,' she said. 'And your music is so – so different . But so exciting .' To put it lightly, Aimée had not really heard jazz music before. But she enjoyed it immensely. It almost – dared she say it – put classical tunes to shame. 'It isn't Beethoven, Mamma,' Berlioz said, starting to dance to the music, 'but it sure bounces.' 'Say,' Scat Cat said with a chuckle. 'This kid knows where it's at!' Then the music began to overtake everything. 'How 'bout you and me, Aimée?' Thomas asked, offering his hand to her. 'Yes,' she agreed with a smile. 'Let's swing it, Thomas.' 'Now you're talkin' like us,' Thomas said, grinning. The night passed in a whirl of jazz and dancing, and Aimée had never had so much fun in her life. But before she knew it, the band of musicians had left, taking their music with them. So she put the children to sleep in the grand bed that had been taking up a large portion of the room, and climbed out of a window on the roof, meeting Thomas who was sitting just beside the chimney. She wasn't fazed at all by the height or the slope, and he seemed surprised to see her joining him. 'I'll bet they're on that magic carpet right now,' Thomas murmured, looking down into the room at the sleeping children. 'They could hardly keep their eyes open,' Aimée said, smiling a little. 'Ah, such an exciting day.' 'It sure was,' Thomas answered. 'And what a finale.' 'Thomas, your friends are really delightful. I just love them.' 'Well, they're kinda rough, you know, around the edges, but if you're ever in a jam, wham, they're right there.' 'And wham, when we needed you, you were right there,' she said softly. 'That was just a lucky break for me, baby,' he replied. 'Thank you so much for offering us your home,' she said. 'I mean, your pad . It's very nice.' 'Well now, wait a minute,' he said, seeming rather surprised. 'You know, this is the low-rent district, remember?' 'No, no, no, I like it.' At his disbelieving look, she continued, 'Well, uh - well, all it needs is a little tidying up and, well, maybe a little feminine touch.' 'Well, if you're applying for the job . . .' He trailed off, looking at her with such an intensity that Aimée started to feel a little self-conscious once again. 'Boy, your eyes are like sapphires,' he murmured. 'Gee . . . that's pretty corny though, huh?' 'No, not at all,' she replied quietly. 'Any woman would like it.' Then she realised how that sounded and desperately tried to cover. 'Oh, I, I mean, even little Marie.' 'Yeah,' he said, dropping his gaze a little. 'All those little kids, Aimée, I love 'em.' 'And they are very fond of you,' she replied, starting to feel relieved she had navigated out of those waters successfully enough. 'You know . . .' Thomas said. After a moment's pause, he carefully took her hand in his. Aimée blushed a little at the initial contact, but didn't pull away. 'They need – well, you know, a sort – a sort of a – well, a father around.' Aimée suddenly realised what he was saying. 'Oh, Thomas,' she murmured. 'Thomas, that would be wonderful.' And she was not only saying it because it was true, but because it was what her heart was telling her. 'Oh, darling,' she said quietly. 'If – if only I could.' 'But why can't you?' he asked insistently, squeezing her hand a little. 'Because of Madam,' Aimée replied. 'I – I could never leave her.' She shook her head sadly. 'But – but Madam is – well, she's just another parent. You're just her heir.' 'Oh, no, no, we mean far more to her than that,' Aimée said, as Thomas' arm slipped around her shoulders. 'Sorry, my dear. We just have to go home tomorrow.' 'Yeah,' Thomas said, but his voice had a dejected tone to it. 'Well . . . I guess you know best. And I'm gonna miss you, baby. Huh, and those kids. Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.' 'Oh, Thomas,' Aimée murmured. She took his other hand and looked him straight in the eyes. 'I really am sorry.' 'I know you are, baby,' he said. 'And I am, too.' He leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss against her lips. Aimée didn't know what to do – she hadn't expected this, but her arms reacted before her head did, circling themselves around his neck and drawing him closer. He finally broke away and murmured, 'Goodnight, Aimée.' Aimée slipped out of his hold and got to her feet. 'Goodnight, Thomas,' she whispered, before walking back along the roof to the window. The sun shone brightly over Paris the next morning, lighting the streets and everything else it could touch. Aimée, Thomas and the children were now walking into the richer districts, and Thomas took it all in wide eyed. ' Hey ,' he said. ' Wow. What a classy neighbourhood. Dig these fancy wigwams.' 'Wigwams?' Aimée asked. 'Are you sure we're on the right street?' he continued. She suddenly realised what he was saying. 'Yes,' she said with an excited nod. 'Yes, let's hurry, we're almost home!' Roquefort, who had been stopping in to see Madam in light of late events, saw them approach through the window. 'Aimée. Kids. Hallelujah!' he cried, peering out of one of the windows. 'They're back!' He started hurrying toward the front door before a thought struck him. 'Oh no,' he murmured. ' Edgar .' The butler himself was lounging in the parlour, smoking a cigar with a glass of wine in his hand. Reacting immediately, Roquefort quietly eased the door shut and turned the lock, before dragging a chair in front of it to block the handles. The three children were now running to the front door, letting out cries of 'Hooray, we're home!' They reached the door and Toulouse yanked on the handle, but the door didn't open. They all smacked into it. 'It's locked,' Berlioz said. 'Come on,' Marie said. 'Let's all start calling. Madam! Madam!' Edgar was just taking a sip of wine when he heard it. The children. 'It can't be them,' he hissed, looking around. He got up and ran to the door, but it wouldn't budge. He jimmied and rattled it, but nothing happened. Roquefort banged at the front window. 'Don't come in!' he cried. But his warning fell on deaf ears. The children didn't hear him. Aimée and Thomas stood at the front gate, both rather sad as they realised they would now be parting. 'I don't know what to say,' Aimée murmured. 'I only wish that I -' 'Maybe just a . . . short, sweet goodbye would be easiest,' Thomas said heavily. Aimée gave a small nod, and stood on tiptoe to give him a kiss. 'I'll never forget you, Thomas O'Malley,' she said, turning towards the house. 'Bye.' 'So long, baby,' Thomas said as she walked away. The front door opened just as Aimée approached it, and she and the children walked inside. 'Aimée,' Edgar said, smiling at her. 'Where ever have you been?' Then before she knew it, Aimée had a burlap sack over her head and her hands held firmly behind her back. Aimée cried out and struggled, but that only earned her a sharp kick to the shins. 'You came back,' Edgar growled as she let out a yelp of pain, her voice apparently muffled by the sack. 'It just isn't fair,' he muttered. 'Edgar!' someone called from a fair distance away. Or perhaps it was just the sack. Aimée didn't know. 'Edgar, come quickly!' Madam . 'Coming, Madam!' Edgar called, hurrying Aimée forward so quickly that she stumbled a number of times. She could hear from the whimpering next to her that the children were still there. There was the sound of a door opening, and Aimée was shoved roughly into a cooler room, before the door shut with a click behind her. 'I'll take care of you later,' Edgar muttered. Wrenching the sack off her head, Aimée looked around. They were in the pantry. All three of her children were standing close by her skirts, looking afraid. 'Oh, Edgar, they're back. I heard them!' Madam said as she hurried down the stairs. 'Hurry, hurry, let them in.' Edgar ran to the door and opened it. 'Aimée! Children! Come here, my darlings!' Madam said, walking outside. 'Where are you? Come on.' 'Ah, allow me, Madam,' Edgar insisted, stepping outside. 'Aimée! Children! Toulouse! Berlioz! Marie!' 'His name is O'what?' Roquefort asked, pressing his ear up against the locked pantry door. He had no key, and couldn't open it, and it was quite soundproof, so he struggled to hear. 'His name is O'Malley! O'Malley!' Aimée said desperately. 'Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey!' Marie added. 'Oh, never mind,' Aimée said. 'Run! Move! Go get him!' 'Yes, yes, I'm on my way!' Roquefort said, already hurrying out the door. He had no idea where Madam was, and doubted she would ever believe him if he pinned the blame on her loyal butler. So this O'Malley guy sounded like the best help he was going to get. 'Oh, it's no use, Edgar,' Madam said, shaking her head sadly. 'I'm afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady. I was so sure that I heard them . . .' She walked away, back upstairs. 'I'm so sorry, Madam,' Edgar said. But a broad smile spread across his face all the same. Now, he had a truck to call. Roquefort hurried down the street, chasing after the man that Aimée sought. He saw a ginger figure disappearing around the street corner, and hastened after him. 'Mr O'Malley!' he shouted. He rounded the same corner and jumped in front of the man who was walking along dejectedly. 'Hey, stop! ' O'Malley looked at him in surprise. 'Aimée . . .' Roquefort gasped. 'Children . . . in trouble . . . butler did it . . .' His eyes widened as he took in what Roquefort said. 'Look,' he said quickly. 'You get Scat Cat and his gang, okay? I'm gonna need help. Move! 'Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you and you won't have a bit of trouble!' he shouted, already turning and running back the way he came. Minutes later Roquefort found himself rushing through the poorer areas of Paris, looking around wildly for this \"Scat Cat\". 'No trouble, he said,' he muttered. 'Well that's easy for uh, what's-his-name to say.' He turned, and was greeted instantly by a maliciously grinning face. Roquefort jumped in surprise and backed up. But then there was another. And another. Soon he was completely surrounded. 'What's a little swinger like you doin' on our side of town?' one in a red and black bowler hat asked. 'Oh, please,' Roquefort begged, breathing heavily. 'I was sent here for help! By one of you lot!' 'This is outrageous, this is crazy!' Bowler Hat said, a wicked smile spreading across his face. The lot of them started laughing as Roquefort shrunk back. 'B-but honest!' he insisted. 'He told me just to mention his name!' 'So, start mentioning names,' one man with a heavy Russian accent said. Then Roquefort was stumped. The name had actually slipped from his mind. 'Wait a minute, fellas,' he said. 'D-don't rush me. His name is O'Toole.' 'I don't dig him,' Bowler Hat said. 'Strike one.' ' Ohh . . . O'Brian!' 'Strike two.' 'Oh boy. You do believe me, don't you?' 'Keep talkin',' a man with an English accent said. 'How about O . . . Grady?' 'Paperboy, you just struck out,' Bowler Hat said. 'Any last words?' Roquefort trembled in fear, and he suddenly remembered who had gotten him into this mess in the first place. 'Oh, why did I listen to that O'Malley?' 'O'Malley?' Top Hat cried, an actual smile finally visible on his face. He must have been Scat Cat. The rest of them also voiced the name, just as surprised. 'Hold it, guys,' Scat Cat said. 'This little guy's on the level!' 'O'Malley needs help,' Roquefort said stoutly. 'Aimée and the children are in trouble!' The men all exchanged a look. 'Come on, cats,' Scat Cat said. 'We gotta split!' Then they all suddenly took off, running out of the alley. 'Hey, wait for me!' Roquefort cried. 'You don't know the way!' O'Malley looked into one of the windows of the Bonfamille mansion to see the butler on the phone, Aimée gripped firmly in one hand by the hair, and the children all roped together and bound to his wrist. There were gags in all of their mouths. The butler then hung up, and dashed out the back towards the horse stables, dragging Aimée and the kids with him. 'Now, you pests,' the butler said once he was inside. O'Malley watched what was going on through a shattered window. 'You're going to travel first class. In your own private compartment.' He wrenched open the lid of a trunk, and shoved Aimée inside, before unroping the children and piling them on top. He then shut it and slapped a padlock on it. 'All the way to Timbuktu. And this time, you'll never come back.' Pure anger settled in the bottom of O'Malley's chest, and he slipped into the stables unnoticed, ready to give that butler what he deserved. 'Oh, we've got to hurry,' the butler said, now pushing the trunk towards the doors. 'The baggage truck will be here any moment, now.' It was then that O'Malley dove on him with an almighty yell. He wrestled the man before diving forward and slamming the doors shut, making sure they were both bolted. The butler growled and ran forward as O'Malley focused on the trunk, before yanking it back open again. Then they both wrestled over the trunk for a minute, before the butler grabbed a wicked looking machinery blade and started swiping at him. O'Malley shoved a ladder at him, and after losing his first weapon, the butler resorted to a pitchfork. He chased after the other man with it, stabbing viciously before hurling it. Twang. It stuck into the wooden wall, two of the points sitting on either side of O'Malley's neck. The butler ran across the room, yanked the door back open, and gasped in shock as he saw what was coming. He quickly closed it again, but it burst open as Scat Cat and his gang charged in, yelling something intelligible. The paperboy – Roquefort, he thought his name was, from what Aimée had told him – hurried over. 'Over there, they're in the trunk!' O'Malley said, pointing as he struggled to remove the pitchfork. The fighting on the other side of the stables was deafeningly loud. Roquefort knelt down and put his ear to the lock, trying to open it. O'Malley finally forced the pitchfork away, and was about to go help his friends when Roquefort suddenly yelled: ' QUIET! ' Instantly there was silence. Everyone had paused in what they were doing, but the moment he had opened the lock, the fighting resumed. O'Malley rushed over and flipped off the lid of the trunk. He pulled the children out, and helped to remove their gags, saying, 'Everybody, outta here, fast!' But before he could help Aimée out, the butler ran forward and slammed the lid shut. 'You are going to Timbuktu,' he growled, swinging about a club he had somehow acquired, 'if it's the last thing I do!' Then someone yanked on a rope, releasing a bale of hay that had been strung up, right above the butler. It tumbled down and smacked him on the head, and he barely had time to recover from that before various objects were tossed down on him from above, some getting him stuck to a point where he couldn't move. When he fell off the trunk from overbalancing, O'Malley opened it again and pulled Aimée out, finally removing that sack from her head and giving her a brief embrace. Seconds after that happened, the butler had been shoved into the trunk and the padlock put back on it. It was shoved out the door just as the baggage truck arrived. 'Well, Mac, this must be the trunk, eh?' one of the drivers said as the two of them got out, walking around to the trunk. 'Yup. And she goes all the way to Timbuktu.' With some grunting and apparent effort, they lifted up the trunk and tossed it into the truck. Then it was gone. 'Yeah!' Toulouse yelled, punching the air in the direction that they left. 'Take that, Edgar!' It was a pleasant night when the attorney Georges Hautecourt was called back to the Bonfamille manor. Up in the study, a small family was sitting on the sofa. Well, the soon-to-be family. Aimée knew that Thomas wasn't quite related to them just yet, but that was to change soon. 'Now,' Madam said from behind the camera. 'A little closer together.' They all shuffled and did just that. 'Good,' Madam said. 'Look, Georges,' she said, turning to the man behind the desk. 'What do you think?' 'Very good, very good,' he said nodding earnestly. 'But I think we should get on with the will.' 'Yes, yes, of course, but, you know what to do,' Madam said, draping the black cloth over her head. 'Very well – scratch one butler.' Aimée looked over at Thomas, who had actually, rather remarkably, been forced into a bowtie for the photograph. They both smiled, and exchanged a look of knowing when they heard what Madam said next. 'You know Georges, if only Edgar had known about the will, I'm sure he never would have left.' Oh, Edgar hadn't left. Willingly, of course. 'Aimée, it's wonderful to have you all back,' she said fondly, taking a comb and sweeping forward to tame the ginger hair on Thomas' head. 'And I think this young man is very handsome.' 'I think so, too, Madam,' Aimée said. 'And I'm not letting you take him off me,' she added jokingly. ' I'm his fiancée. You're the mother-in-law.' Madam laughed. 'I know, dear, I know. And of course we're going to keep him in the family. We need a man around the house.' 'And Georges,' she added, 'we must be sure to provide for their future little ones.' Thomas blinked rather rapidly at that statement, gulping rather audibly. Aimée nearly laughed, and just smiled at him knowingly. He finally seemed to recover from that shock, and she leaned her head into his shoulder as he smiled back at her. 'Of course,' Georges said. 'The more, the merrier.' 'Now, don't move,' Madam said, finally starting to take the photograph. 'And smile. Say cheese!' The children went right ahead and said that, while Aimée and Thomas just smiled. 'Thank you,' Madam said. 'Now, children, run along downstairs. There's a surprise for you.' With those words being enough to spur them, the children were out the door faster than Aimée could count them. 'I really do love those kids, baby,' Thomas said, taking her hand and lacing their fingers. 'I know you do,' Aimée replied. 'I know you do.' 'I wouldn't mind some more, you know,' he added. 'I mean -' 'Thomas,' Aimée said, laughing. They both walked out the door and down the hallway. 'It's quite alright. It was a rather forward statement, after all.' 'Yeah,' Thomas said. He turned to her. 'Those eyes still look like sapphires to me,' he said. 'Would it change?' Aimée asked. He shook his head. 'Never. Never ever.' And with a little smile, he dipped his head down to kiss her once again, just like that time on the roof of his old home. 'In fact,' he murmured, 'sapphires dull in comparison.'

Then, pausing to let the substance of her words sink in, he turned to her and asked \"What?\" She put a finger to her mouth to stifle her mirth, but it shone apple bright in her eyes. \"Inside joke,\" she clarified, and he nodded, obviously still not quite getting it. \"I was a waiter!\" he cried, astounded. \"I was a terrible waiter! I got fired. Oh--\" and his voice dropped low. \"Best not tell your lovely mother that.\" \"I'll let you break that news to her. During your interview?\" He tossed the ball into the air, let it make a break for the beetle black sky before snatching it back down thoughtfully. \"I think I'll really try it. I mean, you would think with so much experience juggling knives and fire and other dangerous things,\" he glanced at her subtly, to see if she was impressed, but she gave no indication, \"It would be easy enough to juggle trays and meal orders, but it's just not the life for me. This, now...\" And with a glance around the crowd, his eye caught at the attractive woman in the ticket booth, shooting a disapproving look in his direction, and he seemed suddenly to realise that he had been talking too much and too fast, taking up this unknown girl's time for too little reason. He really wouldn't like to get kicked out of the circus before he got a chance to join it. With a deferential bow, he stretched his long arms to the ground, to find the missing red and black orbs and hold them out to her. \"I'm terrible sorry, I knock you over and talk your ear right off, and while you're on the job.\" She did not reach for them, sensing perhaps the finality that move would bring to the conversation. \"Without even introducing yourself,\" she corrected. \"Without even that. I don't seem to selling myself much as a juggler, dropping my manners everywhere. I'm--\" \"Let me guess,\" she interrupted, putting a finger to a temple. \"Val?\" \"Not even close. I guess you're not the fortune teller I thought you were.\" Her brow creased, as if she was actually surprised at her guess missing the mark. \"Or are you?\" He asked in a headlong rush of breath, hoping not to have offended her more. \"It's okay, really, I'm told I'm hard to read.\" \"You're a very important man...\" she muttered, just audible. Then, louder, \"Makes sense, I suppose. I'm not called Dark Princess in this world either.\" He gave her a look. He turned to take in the red and gold of the crowd, the milling bodies and faces, the neon green glow and stale popcorn smell, and then he gave her the same look again. The balls rolled and shone in his hand, and he picked one out to toss to her. She caught it and automatically threw it back. Another dropped out of the air in her direction, and she caught it and it, too, flew from her hand. Soon they had set an easy rhythm between them, and the hum and soft thwap set up a steady tempo for the fiddle and the voices to work to. \"Sean\" He said, finishing his sentence of earlier. \"I'm Helena,\" she replied. _____________ More to this later, though it'll be more a series of vignettes, I guess, than a full plot. Sorry if there seem to be confusing phrasing or missing words... it's intentional, actually. I've been reading a lot of Ray Bradbury, if that explains it.[Chapter 2] Their juggling act progressed quickly, they worked naturally together. Their friendship, too. It was as if she had accepted that they should be friends before she had even met him. She would say the oddest things on occasion. When he asked \"are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" expecting a reply of \"curry,\" instead he would get one about wheels on shoes. In between juggling and the work he did manning the ticket booth or sweeping the remains of a show from the aisles, they would lie on the floor of her trailer, and he would hand her pencils while she drew. She was dedicated to the drawing. It spanned her walls and in corners even the floor. Out of costume there were always graphite smudges on her cheeks and her fingers were black as pitch. She tried to explain it to him once. \"I've got to make it interesting for them, of course\" At the time he was too busy smirking at a particularly bad smudge on the side of her nose.[Chapter 3] \"What's this?\" It was light, and spiky, and shaped rather like a half-dish. \"It's your mask!\" \"I'm not sure I'll be able to see through these holes.\" Nevertheless, he put the mask on and his vision seemed to open up in front of him, to sharpen and deepen. She gathered cream makeup in white and grey, and started to cover the lower half of his face with it. A thick stripe vertically across his lips which had the sweet, numbing tang of aloe to it. When she was done, greasy fingertips still resting against his chin, she looked at him and said \"I miss you.\" He wanted to ask what she meant, but in the moment she looked so sad that he couldn't say a thing, only lean forward to kiss her swiftly, on the lips. \"Nerves\", he said, as if that were a sensible explanation. Then, only thinking of a better one after the fact, he added it in hopes that she wouldn't notice. \"For luck.\" \"For luck\" she nodded. (And it seemed her sorrow had been scared off… so at whatever cost to his pride, he deemed the act worth it.) She wiped the grey on her fingers and lips onto a towel stained already with red and orange and green.[Chapter 4] Her own mask was heavy. Bits of glass reflected only the blueish light of the backstage, except when he thought he caught his own reflection in it, like a ghost. He felt as pale as the costume he wore. In the dark, with her body wrapped in black tatters, she looked like nothing more than a floating, mirrored face. \"Okay, then,\" She said, \"Here we go!\" The curtain swept aside, taking his stomach with it. The spotlights, at least, were bright enough to hide the expressions in the audience. Her mask shone shattered and ice white in the glare, and it set off a feeling of familiarity… the same he had felt when he first bumped into her. The same he felt lying on her floor talking among crayons and coal and white lines on black and black lines on white. He focused on it, the light and the feeling, and followed as she swept into the ring like a bird.[Chapter 5] \"May I ask you a question?\" \"Yes?\" \"Why Valentine?\" She had been calling him by another name almost since they first met. Valentine , sometimes Her Valentine . Sometimes she would sing to him, \"My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine.\" At first it would slip out, but when he didn't object, she started to use it regularly. He trusted it was an inside joke… one of many. He never minded, but he often wondered. \"You remind me of someone I knew.\" \"Ah,\" he said. \"Ah.\" And, in a bit, \"I was hoping it was because you liked me.\" \"I do like you,\" she said, rather obviously. He smiled his sideways smile to match her own straight one. \"But I'm no Valentine.\" \"Only you are! Sort of... I've been trying to say…\" She took his hand, picked up an eye pencil from the dressing table beside him, and started to draw as she told him. \"I once had a dream,\" she said, laying down soft lines. In between marks of the pencil, her breath brushed his fingertips. \"And in the dream, I met a man named Valentine, who wore a mask.\" She added the mask, lightly smudging a grey line down his palm with her finger. \"A very important man. He helped me on a quest, but sold me out to the dark queen for an armful of rubies.\" \"Some man,\" he interrupted. \"Hush.\" her brow creased as she sketched a mouth, a spiky chin. \"But he came back, and he saved me.\" The eyes came last, two small dots. \"I loved him, and I miss him,\" she kissed the drawing on his palm, and looked up. \"And he was you.\" His mask had been on, still, so he took it off. \"Would I sell you for an armful of rubies?\" \"You might, but you would always come back.\" He considered this, weighing the mask in one hand against the drawing in another. \"You're a rather strange girl.\" he said. \"I am.\" ","Summary":" \"You'd have made a terrible waiter.\" The boy, the young man with the spiky hair and the familiar "},{"Movie":"Aristocats","Title":"Berlioz's Trick or Treat Adventure","Author":"VivianLovesCats","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10038801","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Berlioz's Trick or Treat Adventure Chapter 1 The Boring morning Good morning sport said Thomas o Mali your mother is going to the vet for a checkup so I'm in charge for a while.

She heard him grunt in reply, at least she knew he wasnstill there. Theyncame to a stop in front of the last window. Helena could see thenprincess, her dark twin, twirling and laughing on the apartment roof.nAnger boiled up inside her, how dare she steal her life, her home! 'Valentine!nGive me the mask!' she called urgently, there was no answer. Confused,nHelena turned to face him. He was just stood there, looking at her. 'Valentinenplease!' Valentinenremained where he was, the mirrormask in his hand, he averted herngaze and shifted his weight from one foot to another. 'Erm,nHelena, can I come with you?' Helenanblinked, they were running out of time, but she answered him in ancalm voice, the answer she both wanted to say and what he wanted tonhear. 'Yes,nif you want.' Theneffect was electric, she could have sworn he physically glowed. 'Younsure? Really?! I can juggle? You'll let me stay? We'll do what richnpeople do?' Helenangiggled, despite herself. 'Yes,nof course! But only if you give me the mask Valentine!' Hensmiled and tossed it to her. She caught it, looked at the princess. 'HerenI come....Valentine! Hold on!' Shenfelt Valentine grab her upper arm as she placed the silver mask onnher face. Thendarkness pulled her into the window. Her ears could hear Valentine'snfrightened yelps, and the princess' angry cry of 'Nooooooo! You can'tnmake me go baaaaaacccckkkkkk!', but all her eyes could see was anwarped sense of blacklight..... -------------------------------------- 'Helena?nHelena sweetie, wake up' Helena'sneyes opened reluctantly to see the image of her father swim intonview. He smiled and patted her arm. 'Comenon sleepy head, what are you doing up here?' Helenansat up. The princess was nowhere to be seen, but neither wasnValentine. Standingnup Helena felt her dad's coat on her shoulders. He was talking butnshe wasn't really listening, where was he? Had it been a dream? Shenlooked around her, but all she could see was the skyline of the city,npanic seeped through her as she began to think it had all been andream..... No.nNo dream is that realistic, and people like Valentine did not justnwander into your subconscious without a good reason. He had to benreal, but he wasn't there. Why wasn't he there? 'Arenyou alright honey?' 'Hmmm?nOh, fine dad fine, I'm just....' 'Didnyou lose something Helena?' Morris asked kindly. Helenanlooked at him in surprise. Losing Valentine was, well, not good. 'Sortnof I guess.' 'Don'tnworry love, it'll turn up...' Helenanbit her lip, taking a final look of the roof she followed her father.nShe suddenly wished Valentine had kept a tighter grip on her arm. Wherenis he? Willnwe ever find out? Oh come on, would I do that to you?[Chapter 2] So,nwhere oh where could Valentine have gone? Ok, I'mntaking several liberties with this, but please let me know if anybodynappears out of character. Thanks! Helenantossed the balls in the air, watching the circles of colour. Valentinenhad never showed up. It had been a whole year. She never really gavenup, not really, she still half expected him to pop up out of nowherenand crack a sarcastic joke. Butnshe had met Vernon. At first she had thought it was Valentine, butnher hopes were swiftly and cruelly dashed after he didn't understandnher quip about being a waiter. It was odd... he looked to much likenValentine. Helena had learnt quickly that, though they looked alike,nthey were as different as day and night. Vernon was nice,ndown-to-Earth and considerate where Valentine was sardonic, selfishnand downright rude. She liked Vernon a lot, in a goofy brother-sisternkind of way. Herntrailer was still covered in drawings, a lot of them of the maskednjuggler. Helena promised herself she only drew them to keep him alivenin her memory, if it had only been a dream, she didn't want tonforget. Anhand shot out of nowhere and caught one of the juggling balls.nLaughing, Helena saw Vernon step into view and they juggled for anwhile outside the big-top tent. The show didn't start until tonight,nthey were practicing. 'Pennynfor your thoughts?' He asked cheerfully. 'Yeah,nif I did actually have a penny for every time I heard that, I'd be anmillionaire.' she replied. Vernonnlaughed but stopped juggling, he looked at her questioningly. 'Seriously,nwhat's up kid?' Helenanshrugged her shoulders and smiled; a little to brightly. 'Nothing,nwhy would you think somethings wrong?' 'Becausenwhen you're upset, you juggle by yourself, frown and mutter things.'nHe checked off each of these things on his fingers in a list. 'Oh,nwhat do I mutter?' 'Littlenthings, but you say the word 'Valentine' a lot, are you seeingnsomeone behind my back?' he added jokingly. Helenanshoved him, giggling. 'Don't flatter yourself.' 'Okay,nokay, I know when I'm not wanted.' he mocked a huff, then turned andnsmiled at her. Helenanfelt a check in her breathing, why did they have to be so bloodynsimilar?! 'Wantnto go into town tomorrow? You can mope and I can run around in anpanic, trying to get a birthday card behind you back.' asked Vernon. Helenanbit back the 'I don't mope' and said 'Sure, but you pay for the busntickets.' 'Deal.'nhe said, then winked at her and walked away. Helenanresumed her juggling. She couldn't imagine the other guynpaying for a bus ticket. In fact, she never recalled him paying fornanything. 'Bugger' she breathed, as she dropped a ball, ' Ha, henwas an important man wasn't he? I don't expect VIPs to do anythingnthe hard way....' Vernon?nValentine? Who can tell? Hopenyou're enjoying it so far....chapter 3 will be up soon.[Chapter 3] Hellonagain. I would have updated sooner but my English coursework took upnall my time. Sorry. Ifnyou're reading this chapter, thanks for sticking with me. Helenanand Vernon sauntered through the busy town center, trying to navigatentheir way through the battleground of shoppers and passers by. Vernonnthrew a sweet wrapper in the bin and began his traditional musings onnoutings like this. Helena hated this. It just reminded her ofnValentine, not that there was anything wrong with this...it just madenher feel guilty that she lost him. Likenlosing a life long companion and a soul mate....while attempting tonrescue little girls.... Helena bit her lip, she really didn't make any body'snlife easier did she?... Whatnthe hell have you got on your feet?! Remembering his incredulous question caused her lips tontremble. For a moment she didn't know whether to laugh or cry, butnshe opted for the former and let out a stifled chuckle. Vernon wasn'tnreally listening. 'Younknow, if I get a Saturday job, I think I could get a flat and staynwith the circus full-time...' Againstnher better judgment, Helena decided to roll with it. 'Youncould always be a waiter.' Vernonnlooked scandalised. 'No,nI don't want to be a waiter!' Shennearly dropped her bag. Helena spun round to look at him, eyes widenin suprise. 'Whatndid you say?' Vernonnlooked at her uncertainly. 'Insaid I don't think waitering is really for me. Why, what did younthink I'd said?' Helenanwas confused, she was sure she had heard him right. 'Inthought you said you didn't want to be a waiter.' 'Well,nI don't. What is it with you and waiters anyway?, you said somethingnlike this the first time we met.' 'Oh....Inhad a...friend once. He was terrified of becoming a waiter. You justnremind me of him slightly that's all.' Vernonnnodded understandingly, but still regarded her with an odd look onnhis face. Anpassing mother and child snapped them both to reality. Vernon clappednhis hands together and smiled brightly. 'Well,nI've got to go take care of something, just mosey round and I'll meetnyou by MacDonald's okay?' Shennodded, glad for the change of subject. Vernon turned and strode downna side street, leaving Helena on her own. Shrugging she began tontrudge down the road, nearly crashing into an elderly couple. 'Sorry'nshe muttered. Whatnhad just happened? She had got the two mixed up again. STUPID!nValentine wasn't even here, how could she get the two wrong? Helenanwalked along the busy street with no real aim in mind. Just thinkingnabout MacDonald's made her feel sick, but she knew Vernon told her tonmeet him there as a way of a birthday present. It was a nice thought,nbut she really wasn't hungry. Ansound reached her ears. 'Whatndo you mean 10%? Listen, I'm the manager here, and what I say goesnalright? No I can't come down to discuss it with you, I'm a verynimportant man. Well that's just you're opinion...' Helenanfrowned and walked towards the source of the noise. It was ansarcastic Irish voice, it sounded like Vernon. 'Allnthe money I can carry? I've had that offer before my friend, itndoesn't agree with me.' Helenanstopped dead in her tracks. That wasn't Vernon.....Could it be?... 'WellnI'll find a new partner. You weren't a very good juggling associatenanyway...' Shenuttered a small scream, clapping her hands over her mouth she begannwalking at a faster pace, following the voice she felt her heart missnseveral beats.... Valentine! Helenanwas running now, dodging several people she hurtled toward a a redntelephone box. Thenman inside had his back to her. His blond hair spiked up in annunusual fashion. Helena stood like a statue as she studied thenover-large white coat with dark trousers. There was no mistake thisntime. Trying to control her breathing she saw him put the phone down. Henturned around. (Gigglesnwith fangirly pleasure) What amnI going to do with these two? Nextnupdate includes Valentine's explanation, Helena struggling to regainncomposure and a very confused Vernon.... See younthere![Chapter 4] Again,nsorry for the delay. Henturned around. Itntook Helena a full 10 seconds to resume breathing. Her heart seemednto stop and she felt a shiver run down her spine as he turned hisnwide, shocked hazel eyes on her. Valentinengaped stupidly. Absentmindedly he raised his hand to touch the masknhe remembered wasn't there. Thisnwas weird, he thought. Searching the entire country to find someonenwho was in the first city you started in. Thentwo of them stood as still as statues, then Valentine opened the doornof the telephone box and stood opposite her. Saynsomething! Helena implored herself silently, Hello, How are you?nAnything for God's sake! Itnwas Valentine who broke the silence. 'Helena?'nhe asked uncertainly. Thenknot within Helena's chest fell out of her. It was as if she'd fallenninto her dream again, she studied his now mask-less face. It was verynsimilar to Vernon's, yet subtly different, Vernon's eyes were open,ntrusting and Valentine's were slightly shrewd and aware. 'Valentine?nI-Is that you?' she asked back, taking a small step towards him. Pleasepleaseplease saynit's you...... Thenyoung man let out a bark of laughter, rushing toward her he pickednher up and spun her around in an all-consuming hug, Helena gasped,ntaken by surprise. 'Helena!nFantastic! It's you Helena!' He shouted, joy resonating in his voice. 'Ofncourse it's me!'she giggled, tears scalding her eyes. 'Put me downnyou Leprechaun!' Hentwirled her for a while then put her down, pulling away he studiednher. 'You'vengrown a few inches, you're a little thinner but I still don't likenyour choice of footwear.' Helenansmiled and looked down at her trainers. Well, bunny slippers were anbit strange. She glanced back up at him. 'Yesnwell...where's your mask?' 'Why?nDo you think I need it?' he pouted, pulling the square mask from hisnsleeve. Helena stopped him. 'No,nyou're fine....' Thensilence descended once more . Valentine shuffled his feet in angesture that was so like him Helena felt a little dizzy. 'Wherenhave you been Valentine?' she asked, astonished at the quiet littlentremble in her own voice. He returned the mask to the recesses of hisncoat. 'Inthink I must have let go of you're hand at the wrong time. I ended upnin a skip.' Helenanlaughed. Valentine looked very affronted as he brushed his handnthrough his blond hair, continuing his story. 'Anyway,nI tried to find you but someone told me the circus had moved on. Carento explain that one for me little girl?' 'Oh,nthat. Yeah, my dad moved us up to Sheffield for a few months, but wencame back because we did better business here.' 'Oh,nOk...Where was I? Oh yes, so I looked in the phone book to try andnfind a circus. I ended up with something called the Sirk Doo Soley.nStupid name for a circus if you ask me.' 'Cirquendu Soleil' Helena corrected him. 'Yeah,nanyway I stayed with them for a while. Until I had enough money tonstart my own juggling...but...' He gestured at the telephone box 'Itndidn't go that well....' Henclapped his hands together. 'It doesn't matter though! I've found younnow! Now I can stay with you!' Helenannodded and began to hug him, but she stopped, gasping. 'Vernon!'nshe cried, Valentinencocked his head to the side. 'No...Valentinenremember?' Helenanblinked and backed away hurriedly. Vernon! She'd forgotten all aboutnhim! 'Valentine,nI'm so sorry, I've got to meet someone!' Valentinensmiled and jogged after her as she rushed down the road. 'OK,nI'll come with you, who is it?' 'Vernon.nA boy from the circus.' Valentinenstopped, Helena fell back and stared at him. 'Who?'ndemanded Valentine. 'Anboy from the circus, a very good friend of mine. I said I'd meet him.nWhy? Have you got a problem with that?' 'Me?nNo, no, no, I just....erm....will I like him?' 'Well,nI do. So there's no reason why you shouldn't' Helena mutterednawkwardly. 'Besides, he's a lot like you.' 'Really?nHow much like me? I bet you he doesn't have my wit, my charm, myndevilishly good looks?' Morenthen you'll ever know you arrogant coward... 'I really can't tell the difference.' said Helenanmeekly. Bwahaha!nI decided to cut this chapter and the next chapter in two. Makes mynlife easier. Seenya next time people! Next chapter has Valentine and Vernon meeting.[Chapter 5] Hi again folks! I'm sorry it feels like it's been forever but I hope you all had a great Halloween! Oh, and air cookies to anyone who can spot the 'Van Helsing' reference! xD! Vernon glanced up and saw Helena rushing towards him. One look told him that she was very, very worried. Uh-oh.... When she reached him he tried to ask her what was wrong. 'Helena?' he attempted. She gasped and studied him. 'Vernon?! Oh, um...hi, I hope you don't mind, I've brought a friend...' 'Um, sure, who is it?' Helena didn't answer and glanced behind her. Vernon followed her gaze, only to start as he saw the guy with her. He looked exactly like him. Hair, eyes, height, teeth, everything! For a long moment all three of them stood there; Vernon looking at Valentine, Valentine looking at Vernon, Helena looking at both of them. Both men sported a look of stunned confusion. 'Erm, hi?' Vernon ventured, pushing out his hand for a handshake in a futile effort to cover his bewilderment. 'I'm Vernon.' The young man shook it cautiously, 'I'm Valentine.' Vernon's gaze rested on Helena, silently pleading her for some sort of explanation. She shrugged, what could she say? Valentine scratched his head in confusion. 'Helena, this is very weird.' he told her stupidly. Vernon raised an eyebrow. 'What? You mean the fact you're my clone?' Helena cleared her throat, the two guys looked at her doubtfully. 'This is going to take some explaining...' she faltered. 'So...' mused Vernon, prodding a soggy scrap of bread left from the burger, 'You're my twin, a fantastical version of me from a world which you', he nodded at Helena 'created.' 'I like that word, fantastical... ' repeated Valentine, totally at ease in the awkward situation. 'Erm, yes, kind of.' Helena said rubbing her forehead wearily. 'But, I don't understand...' Vernon began. 'I told you he didn't have my brains.' Valentine commented, half to Helena, half to himself. Vernon rolled his eyes, he was really beginning to dislike this Valentine. 'But, how can Valentine exist if you'd never see me before that time we met in the circus tent?' Helena was at a loss. Valentine was confused. Vernon was a tad agitated. Great, I'm a rebound for an imaginary jester... For a while none of them spoke. Helena glanced at Valentine. He was picking his teeth, but he stopped and shared a reassuring smile with her. Vernon saw the smile between the two of them. He was actually OK with it. He had never seen anything other than a kid sister in Helena anyway, but seeing his mirror image look at her with a bit more than friendship in his eyes was downright creepy. It was like fancying your cousin, and that, he was certain, was dodgy territory. Glancing at his watch he saw their afternoon was up. 'Helena? We'd better get going.' Both Valentine and Helena started and looked at Vernon, almost as if they had forgotten he was there. 'Oh, OK, look, Vernon, I'm so sorry about...you know, this.' she began pathetically. 'Hey,' he smiled 'I'm sorry your birthday treat ended up with a conversation about existence and the whole -windmills-of -your-mind- bonanza.' 'Birthday?' Valentine asked. He was ignored. 'See you tomorrow Helena.' Vernon said. 'Your not coming back with us?' she asked. 'Not today, my Dad wanted me to sort out the attic this evening.' It was a lame excuse really, but, in all honesty, he wanted to have a bit of a lie down. 'Oh, well, I'll see you tomorrow.' Helena said, hugging him. 'Thanks for the trip.' Vernon smiled at her, glanced at Valentine with a bemused expression, then gave a curt nod and left. Helena breathed out, slowly. 'That was embarrassing.' She told Valentine. A thought hit her. 'Where are you staying anyway?' 'Hmm? Oh, I er, hadn't thought...'he admitted. Helena rolled her eyes in exasperation. She was overjoyed to have him back, and she certainly didn't want him gone again. But she had assumed he had a plan, it didn't have to be Wellington at Waterloo but some kind of plan would have been nice. 'You can stay in my trailer, but we'll have to be sneaky, two Vernon's is going to cause confusion if your seen. Valentine nodded and laughed slightly. 'Right. I'll do my best.' Helena smiled slightly. Valentine studied her face surreptitiously. He hated to admit it (she still looked odd without the mask) but the way her mouth made that little crescent moon shape when she was happy was quite...nice really. He clapped his hands together. 'First things first though, what did the clone mean by birthday?' Sorry, had to leave it there (damn writer's block). I want to give a shout out to my reviewers, such lovely people! I'm sorry I kept you waiting....Next chapter includes a HelenaxValentine moment, questions about the tower and pepperoni pizza. See you then![Chapter 6] Merry Christmas everybody! Things have been crazy here, I turned 16 and saw Phantom of the Opera in London! (Irrelevant I know, but now I can totally die happy xD) Now the Festive season's here I can finally get off my lazy arse and start writing again...*Tries to eat mince pie and swallows pen instead...* Helena ushered Valentine into her trailer, after double-checking no-one saw her. He stood in the center and surveyed his new surroundings before sitting on the bed. Helena watched in a half amused blur as he bounced slightly on her bed, testing it. Valentine turned and smiled at her, then lay back on the bed with a huge sigh of contentment. 'Beats the skip!' he told her happily. Helena laughed and sat on the floor next to him. For a while they were silent, each contemplating the situation. Valentine reached inside his huge white coat and drew out his mask, jamming it onto his face. 'That's better.' he breathed, as if he were sliding into a hot bubble bath. Helena felt a small warm sensation spread in her chest; now he was Valentine. His mask blocked out his eyes, and therefore much of his expression, but somehow she felt that he was much more 'him' with it on. He caught her staring at him. She hazarded a guess that he was frowning. 'What?' he said, 'You'd feel naked without your clothes wouldn't you? I feel exposed without it.' 'I wasn't-' Helena protested, but he had bounced up and was now inspecting her drawings. Helena felt a little embarrassed. She wanted to hear his opinion but suddenly she thought her sketches were crude. Anxiously she bit her lip, he turned around and smiled brightly. 'These are great! You really drew these?' They spent at least ten minuets discussing Helena's artwork, which places were what and who was who. It was like looking up old friends. Valentine uncovered a sketch of himself, a detailed portrait that she had obviously spent several painstaking hours doing. Every thing was correct, even down to the creases in his coat. In his portrait he was juggling. The ghost of a smile forming on his lips, like someone trapped in a beautiful dream. He felt himself blush, guilty at having seen something private. Hastily he stashed it into his coat before she saw, his breathing hitched in his throat. 'Oh, your tower...' came Helena's voice sadly. Valentine started and came back to Earth. Helena was holding a drawing of his tower. 'What will happen to your tower if you're here?' she asked. Valentine cleared his throat, trying to cover up the fact he was an art thief. 'I dunno, nothing probably. Ooooh, what's that?' Helena followed his gaze and saw a small glint on the floor. Valentine walked over and picked it up, Helena recognized it as a fake jewel that must've fallen off her circus costume. Typical Valentine, lover of all shiny things. 'D'you like it?' she asked, giggling inwardly. 'It's pretty', he purred. 'Keep it.' 'Thanks!' he said, stuffing it inside his robe, Helena wondered how many times he must have lost things. Valentine smiled at her and sat on the bed again. 'Yeah, so, the tower. I think it'll probably just stay where we left it, or it could go flying off again...' Helena studied him, sorry that she was the reason he was so far from home. 'I'm sorry Valentine, I lost the Mirrormask, we can't get back.' Valentine's head jerked up and he set about rapidly patting his coat like he did when he thought he'd lost the Princess' note. Helena frowned as he pulled out a silver object and flung it to her. 'It was in the skip with me, I'd forgotten I had it.' It was the Mirrormask. Dumbly Helena turned it over in her hand, incredulous at what she was seeing. He had kept it? For a while both didn't say a word, then Valentine rubbed his stomach thoughtfully. 'Got anything to eat?' he asked genially. 'Um, sure' Helena said, coming out of her pseudo-trance. 'Stay here, I'll get us something...' She got out of the trailer after telling Valentine where the nearest bathroom was and suchlike. It all seemed so unreal, yet so familiar. He was back. Thirty minuets later, both Valentine and Helena were sat on the floor of her trailer munching through slices of Pepperoni pizza. Helena yawned, a warm muzzy feeling in her stomach. 'When is your birthday anyway?' Valentine asked suddenly. Helena turned to look at him. 'A few days away, Saturday. Why?' Valentine shrugged, 'You never mentioned it -you know- last time.' 'Well to be honest Valentine, we were a little busy last time, and it wasn't that important.' Valentine was quiet for a while. Of course it was important, it was her birthday! He thoughtfully chewed this, what was it called, pizza? It was certainly very tasty, better than whatever he'd eaten back home.... Helena closed her eyes contentedly and Valentine felt a hot jump in his stomach...or maybe it was the pizza. Maybe he should do something for her, for her birthday. Something better than a bloody fast food meal anyway, maybe a proper party or something. Valentine reached down for a slice of pizza. And found his hand clutched round something very definitely non-pizza shape. He looked down sharply to find his hand holding Helena's. They had both reached for the pizza at the same time, and ended up holding hands. Valentine's breath hitched and Helena gasped. How very awkward. Valentine snatched his hand back as though she were a spider or something nasty. Helena's face went very red as Valentine cleared his throat. 'So...' he said 'what's Pepperoni?' Helena stared at him, incredulous, then found herself giggling. Valentine laughed along with her, it was a good release for the tension. He suddenly wished he'd said something cooler, more....suave. Now he felt completely idiotic. Helena shivered as a cold breeze blew in through the window. Valentine put his arm around her, shocked by his own ease with her. She lay her drak head against his shoulder, and he felt his blush intensify behind his mask. Valentine blinked, starting out of his doze. 'Helena?' he called softly. She was asleep on his shoulder, they were in the same position they had been after the whole 'Pizza thing.' the last slice of which was lying soggy, cold and forgotten in the cardboard box. Helena's breathing was light and slow, Valentine smiled slightly and picked her up. She was lighter than he was expecting and he carried her across the trailer and lay her down on her bed. He pulled the cover up and tugged it over her, well, he didn't want her to catch a chill now did he? Helena mumbled something in her sleep and settled into a more comfortable position. A lock of her brown hair fell in front of her eyes, which Valentine brushed aside lightly. A flare of tenderness made his face feel hot. A sudden idea came into his brain. He straightened up. It was a brilliant idea, why had he not thought of it before. 'I'm a genius' he whispered to himself, rooting around for the Mirrormask. Holding it up he strode to the circular mirror on Helena's dressing table, he just hoped it would still work. 'Ok, three...two...one...go.' he instructed himself, staring intently at the mirror. He slammed the Mirrormask onto his face. A gentle rush of wind, and he was gone. Like a thief in the night. Hope that was alright for you my friends. Valentine has gone to develop his 'oh so brilliant' plan. He's had a bit of a brain wave, I only hope it's a sensible one. See you next time; where we will see our two favourite characters.....dancing? ","Summary":" Hello,nyes, I know I've got other fanfics on the go but I had to write onenfor Mirrormask! It's suc"},{"Movie":"Aristocats","Title":"Family Matters","Author":"I'mADisgrace","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12992042","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Tom?\" Duchess asked softly, \"Can you please say something?\" The man in question looked up to her, his expression one of disbelief, \"Sorry?\", She sighed, \"I said, can you please say something? You're making me nervous\" The redhead coughed and sat up, adjusting his waistcoat, \"Yeah, I'm sorry, it's just a shock\" he replied. \"Do you think I'm not shocked?\" Duchess frowned, holding her own arms across her body tightly, \"Of course!\" Tom answered quickly, standing and joining her on the lounge seat. He placed an arm around her shoulders and pulled her in closer, \"It's shocking news, very shocking news\", \"But you are happy about it, aren't you?\" the blonde added, panic slipping through her usual sophisticated resolve, \"Yes!\" Tom yelped, \"Of course! I mean- it's happy news! Shocking , but happy news\", She sighed in relief, and turned her body towards him, hugging him tightly, \"I'm so glad you think so\" \"Of course\" he nodded, holding her in return. Tom's eyes were still bulging from their sockets however, their focus over Duchess' shoulder and on the letter from the doctor that lay on the table before them. A letter which confirmed that at the age of forty-seven, she was two, nearly three months pregnant in fact. It was 1923, and despite having been married for eleven years, Duchess and Thomas O'Malley had at no point even considered having children. The triplets were enough, even now that they were grown and spent very little time at home between them. They were as good as Tom's own anyway. No, instead they spent their life together travelling and performing the normal social niceties expected of a high-class family in Paris. Duchess was a well-liked socialite, both beautiful and talented. And Tom, despite being an American, had come to be appreciated too. Being a Yank was bad enough, but being Duchess' second husband had made it all the more difficult, especially being five years her junior. Many of her colleagues had been very reserved about the idea of her marrying again, and many of them who had known her first husband had been set on comparing Tom to him in every aspect. The redhead had easily won them over one by one however. He was charming, handsome and trying his very best to culture himself. Even his wit had its place amongst their conversation. Duchess was extremely proud. It was impossible to tell how the news of her pregnancy would be taken however, and not just by their fellow society members. \"We need to tell the children\" Duchess said, quickly pulling away from her husband, worry once again coming to her expression, \"Already?\" Tom replied, blushing, \"Well we can't keep it from them\" she answered, raising her eyebrows at him. \"No, I suppose not\" he said biting his lip, \"So when are you going to tell them?\" Duchess blinked, as though she had not heard him, \"We need to all sit down together and talk it through\" -So, she had heard him, she was just choosing to ignore his choice of words. \"Well it'll be difficult to get them together right now\" the redhead said with a frown, It was true, these days the triplets each had very busy schedules, even if it wasn't always entirely clear what it was that they were all doing. \"Well I can send someone to find Marie at the salon, and Toulouse will be at the studio\" Duchess then winced, \"Finding Berlioz is the real problem\", Tom mimicked her expression, Berlioz was always the most difficult to track down these days, and he was also the one of the three of them who spent the least amount of time at home -apart from when he slept in until midday of course. That was to say, more often than not, he arrived home in the early hours of the morning, slept until 1 or 2 in the afternoon, and was then gone again by 6. \"I'll go and find him\" Tom said with a nod, standing from the lounge chair, \"Are you sure?\" his wife asked, watching as he collected his suit jacket and pulled it on. He shrugged, adjusting his cuffs, \"I've got a good idea of where he'll be\" \"Well don't be long\" Duchess said standing too, folding her hands in front of herself, Tom looked to the blonde and her concerned expression, \"I won't be\" he said with a gentle smile. He then took a step back towards her, and placing his hand on her arm, planted a gentle kiss against her mouth, The man felt her lips form a soft smile against his own, and after one more reassuring squeeze of her forearm, he finally turned away and headed from the room. 0o0o0 Tom truly did have a good idea of where he would be able to find Berlioz, mostly because he knew something that Duchess didn't, He didn't like lying to his wife, but he honestly believed that on this occasion, it was for her own good. For a long time, Berlioz was considered the most talented of Duchess' children, Not by her of course, she considered each of her children to be equals. It was society on the other hand that did not. Berlioz was handsome, charming and a talented musician. He had so much promise, in composing, playing, and as a potential husband to some lucky girl of course. The moment he had dropped out of music college however, that had all changed, Every offer had dried up. He was still handsome of course, even if he wasn't always the best put together. And he was still charming too, even if he was so aloof that most people didn't get to experience it. It was the music that had changed, Berlioz had said that he simply wanted more freedom, and Tom had a good idea as to why, It was down to Louis Crothers, or 'Uncle Scat Cat' as the children better knew him. Berlioz had started to spend a lot of time with Louis from the age of 13, playing piano for him and his friends. Now at 19, it seemed like that was nightly event. In fact, it was apparently all that he did. Tom hadn't told Duchess for a number of reasons, partly because Louis' clientele were famous for being, well, infamous. But mostly because over the years, Duchess had developed a slight distaste for Louis. She had liked him well enough on their first meeting, all those years ago, back in 1910, during ' the incident' . But since, one very particular thing had coloured her impression, He'd gotten exceedingly drunk at their wedding, and as Tom's best man, had weaved a very long, mostly false yarn about 'the incident'. A yarn that, with a lack for a better word, had made Duchess sound 'loose' as she put it, in regards to the way she had 'thrown herself' at Tom, Since, although the damage had been repaired both by time, and clarification of exactly what had happened, the woman was still weary of Louis. Tom was certain she'd be horrified if she knew about Berlioz's coming and goings with him, and now with the new news of her pregnancy, he was sure that it was not the time to tell her. Although, he still had his doubts, especially as he wandered through the club's front door, Tom winced as he made his way down the short corridor, his hands going deep into his trouser pockets as he shrugged his shoulders up close to his ears. He'd forgotten just how dark it was in there, even in the mid-afternoon, The thick doors and heavy curtains that lined the place left it feeling very closed in, and they acted in muffling the music that played daily too, The melodic, if not slightly disjointed piano music greeted him beyond the final door, as if acting as a testament to that fact. It wasn't exactly recognisable as any one song, 'jaunty' was probably the best way to describe the tune if anything, Tom wasn't surprised by the uncertainty of the music however, especially when he saw that the pianist was so distracted. Berlioz was sharing his piano stool with a very pretty blonde, while an equally attractive brunette sat on top of the instrument, He was looking between the two of them with a huge smile on his face, and a lit cigarette held between two of his fingers that were stumbling absently over the keys. A couple of intoxicated teens sat at a table a few feet away, singing poorly to the music, and making Berlioz and his female company laugh even more. The young man continued to play the melody with one hand as the other placed the cigarette between his lips and he took a long drag of the tobacco, with something else undoubtedly mixed into the blend as well, Tom sighed, placing his hands on his hips, and licking his lips to talk, \"Berlioz?\", The ravenette in question faltered on the next key and he tensed his shoulders, his head receding into his neck. \"Here\" he whispered, passing the cigarette to the blonde girl, before turning on the bench quickly and standing to greet Tom with an overly enthusiastic smile, \"Tom\" he said brightly, stifling a single cough, \"Everything okay?\" he asked, approaching his stepfather. \"This should be tied\" he replied, pointing at Berlioz's tie when he got close enough, The strip of red silk was draped around his collar, far from serving its purpose, \"Oh-\" the young man said looking to it, \"-sorry\", he set about tying it into a half Windsor, luckily without much trouble, \"You won't-\" he paused, looking up to Tom and appealing to him with a nervous expression, \"You won't tell mother about the cigarette, will you?\", \"I'll do you one better, I won't tell her about the girls either\" he replied, folding his arms. Berlioz winced as he fixed the knot of his tie a little too tightly, and definitely too far down from his collar, \"Thank you\" he nodded. He then pulled one hand through his unwashed hair, scooping it way from his eyes, and vaguely leaving it in the shape of a smart coif, \"Is everything okay ?\" he then repeated, \"You don't usually- you never come to see me here\", \"Oui oui, been a while since we've seen you in 'Chateau de Scat', O'Malley\" Berlioz laughed nervously, while Tom stifled a groan. Louis Crothers, the 'Scat Cat' himself had emerged from the curtains, a broad grin on his face as he approached them, He was a stout older aged man these days, rather than a stout middle-aged man. His back hair was filled with greys, but it was mostly covered by his signature bowler hat anyway. \"Louis\" Tom sighed, begrudgingly smiling and accepting the incoming hug, \"Thomas! How are you?\" Louis replied, squeezing the taller man in a tight gripped embrace, The redhead winced as an ache was set into his ribs, but smiled reassuringly as he pulled away, easily slipping his hands back into his pockets, \"I'm well thank you Louis, and yourself?\" \"Only 'well'?\" he chuckled, sitting himself at a table with a bit of a wheeze, \"I'm more than well, you sound like you need a drink\" he added. The 'Scat Cat' then lifted his hand to a man stood at the partially concealed bar by the far wall, and the man began to stack glasses on a tray to bring over to them, \"Oh no, no, I can't stay Louis, I just came to collect Berlioz\" Tom said, shaking his head. \"Our boy Berlioz, of course!\" he replied, he then gestured to the table he was sat at, \"Both of you, join me\" They did as the man said, albeit rather begrudgingly by Tom, and then watched as the barman deposited three cylindrical glasses and a partial bottle of the red wine between them. \"Here we are\" Louis said, pulling the cork out of the bottleneck, \"Wine Berlioz?\" The young man went to answer, but was quickly cut off by his stepfather, \"No thank you Louis, we really can't stay, like I said\" \"Just a quick one Tom\", the man said with a shrug, pouring a very healthy serving of wine, and passing the glass to Berlioz who smiled his thanks, \"I want to make a toast\" old Scat added, pouring a second glass. Tom rolled his eyes but accepted it, finding from the scent that the wine was at least of a much higher quality than he had been expecting. \"A toast-\" Louis said, raising his own glass, which had by far the greatest amount of wine in,\"-A toast to the talented Berlioz, our boy Berlioz and his musical prowess\" Tom didn't appreciate the term 'our boy Berlioz', not from Louis at least. It likely came from a place of jealousy, but he didn't like to think about that. Berlioz blushed at the toast but said nothing once more, his expression disappearing behind his glass a moment later as he drank a large gulp of wine. His stepfather made short work of his own drink, mostly because he didn't want to hang around for long. Once he was done, he placed the glass on the table, slapped his legs and then stood up, regarding Berlioz and Louis with a look, \"Right, we really need to go\" he said, placing his hands on his hips, \"Already? It's only been a minute Tom\" He shrugged his shoulders, \"Sorry Louis, I said we couldn't hang around for long. Come on Berlioz\" The ravenette looked a little disappointed, but nodded and stood, \"See you later Uncle Louis\" he said, joining his stepfather, \"Yeah, yeah, see you soon kid\" Louis replied, looking equally disheartened. Tom and Berlioz nodded to one another, and started towards the exit, only making it a few steps before the 'Scat Cat' demanded their attention again, \"Don't forget you hat Berlioz\" They turned towards him just as the brunette atop the piano tossed the hat in question to Louis. In turn, he threw it to Berlioz who caught it, \"Oh, thank you\" he nodded, placing it on his head, It was a clean black bowler hat, the 'bowl' and rim of which were separated by a red satin ribbon. Tom stared at the hat, before quirking a curious and confused eyebrow at his stepson, The young man blushed in response, before answering his unspoken question quietly: \"It's just something I'm trying out\" 0o0o0 \"Berlioz!\" Marie said with a huge beam as he entered the foyer of the house, Tom closing the door behind them, \"Hello Marie\" he responded with a smile, accepting the hug she was offering him, \"I thought it was odd getting called home myself, but if you're home too it must mean trouble\" the blonde laughed as they pulled away, \"What?\" her brother asked, quirking his brow. She rolled her eyes at him, \"You know what I mean\" she hitched the spaghetti string of her bag up higher onto her shoulder, \"It must be a serious family meeting if we're all home at the same time\", \"All of us?\" Berlioz asked, looking over to Tom who was watching them from the doorway, The redhead shrugged in response, choosing to not give anything away, \"Afternoon Marie\" he added. The young woman's smile grew and she approached her stepfather, embracing him in a hug too and kissing him on the cheek, \"Good afternoon\" she nodded, pulling away, \"So, are we in trouble?\" she asked with a laugh, Tom rolled his eyes at her and shook his head, \"Come on\" he said, leading the way through to the lounge. Duchess was waiting for them as they entered, still sat on the couch, but she stood as soon as her children came into view, and she quickly went to accept hugs from them both. \"Is everything okay?\" Marie asked, as she and Duchess went back to the longue chair together, their hands joined even as they sat, as her mother seemed resistant to let go. \"Oh, yes. Yes, everything's fine\" she replied, nodding, She then looked to Tom who was stood on the opposite side of the room. He was meandering around by the fireplace, his arms folded and a serious expression on his face, Berlioz meanwhile, was helping himself to a glass of port from the drinks table, \"I thought Toulouse was going to be here too?\" he asked, placing the crystal stopper back into the decanter and raising his drink to his lips, Tom looked across to his wife, his expression asking a similar question. \"He wasn't at the studio\" Duchess replied, \"Toulouse? Not at the studio?\" Marie asked, almost laughing, \"Where else would he be?\" \"No one's sure\" she answered, \"But I'm certain he'll be along soon\" she then let out an awkward cough, \"In the meantime-\" Tom's eyes widened, was she really planning on telling them the news already? The woman was cut off before she could begin however, as the longue door swung open again, this time revealing Toulouse, He looked only marginally more tidy than usual, his outfit sporting half as much paint splatter is it normally would. But the most drastic thing about his appearance, was the massive grin he was wearing, \"Guess who just got their first, full , gallery show?\" he asked, looking between the members of his family, Tom and Duchess shared a look of disbelief, before quickly replacing their worry with expressions of jubilation- their news could wait for now.[Chapter 2] \"What do you think of this?\" Marie asked, lifting a tweed material from the tailor's cart, Toulouse grimaced at the sample, what did he think? Well, it was green he supposed, or mostly green. It was a sort of olive green, interwoven with bold lines of orange thread; if he was being honest, it just looked brown , and not a nice shade of brown either, \"No\" he replied, shaking his head. The blonde frowned and turned back to the collection of fabrics, \"You're making this awfully difficult you know\" \"You're the one who wanted to take me out shopping\" he replied, perching against the table behind him- the tailor working at it gave the young man a sour expression as the surface shifted under his weight, but he said nothing, \"I just want my brother to look nice for his art opening\" Marie answered, \"Is that too much to ask?\" \"I'll just wear my suit\" he said with a sigh. His sister pivoted on the spot and gave him an unconvinced look, \"Your suit doesn't fit you\" The redhead grumbled, but said nothing, knowing that she was in fact correct, \"I know you don't like shopping, but just indulge me, would you?\" Toulouse's sigh became a kind of groaning sound as it rumbled up from the base of his throat, \"But I don't like any of this stuff, why do I need a waistcoat anyway?\" \"Several reasons\" the blonde replied, \"Number one, it will make you look sophisticated, number two, your suit -the one that doesn't fit you- doesn't have a matching waistcoat, and number three, if you won't let me buy you a new shirt, we'll have to find some way of covering all of the paint stains on the clothes you already own\" Her brother was still mostly unconvinced, he didn't see the problem with the clothes he already had, and as such, he didn't see the problem of wearing them to his art opening either. \"Fine, how about a compromise?\" he suggested, standing and approaching her, Marie turned to him again, an eyebrow arched, \"Go on\", \"I let you buy me a new shirt, and instead of buying a new suit, we'll come back and get the trousers from my old suit tailored. No waistcoat. How's that?\", She thought for a moment, \"Fine, but you can't just wear a pair of trousers and a shirt\" Toulouse sighed once again, \"What do you suggest?\" \"A tie\" she answered, smiling. \"No!\" he said quickly, \"I hate ties!\" \"Oh come on! I'll find one that suits you, I promise!\" Marie begged going over to her brother and taking his arm, squeezing it tightly, He looked down at her bright blue eyes, and eager, sweet smile- his sister was one of the only people who could convince him to do anything that he didn't want to do. \"Okay, okay!\" he nodded, shaking her off, \"But only if I really, really like it\", \"You will\" she replied with a beam, \"Promise!\" she added brightly, pitching up and placing a kiss on his cheek. An hour later Toulouse and Marie were back at the tailor's shop after a brief trip to collect his old suit. The redhead was stood in front of three tall mirrors, wincing as the man from earlier crouched in front of him, measuring his inseam. Meanwhile, his sister had wondered off somewhere behind him, hot on her task to pick out a tie. \"So how did it happen?\" she asked, briefly coming into view in the reflection in front him before then disappearing again, \"How did what happen?\" Toulouse replied, looking down at the tailor briefly, as he tried to remain as still as possible, \"How did you get the gallery show?\" the blonde said, \"You've been trying for years\" Although it had not been all that long since Toulouse had gotten his own studio space for painting, there had also been absolutely no interest in his work during that time. Unlike his brother, he had chosen not to go to school for his particular 'talent', which was probably for the best. It was common knowledge that Toulouse's work was an acquired taste, He described it as expressionism, cubism, impressionism, symbolism, surrealism, even art nouveau on occasion, but no one really had any idea what he was talking about. \"It's only been two years\" Toulouse grumbled, coughing to clear his throat, \"A man came to the studio, someone who I met at a gallery opening a few months ago, he liked my work and offered me a space for an exhibition\" he shrugged, earning another glare from the tailor as he shifted on his aching feet, \"That's all\" he added quietly. \"Well I think it's about damn time\" Marie said warmly, stepping up behind him and smiling at him through the reflection, \"Your work is brilliant\" Marie was also Toulouse's most verbal supporter. He smiled at his sister, \"Thank you\" he nodded, \" Bien entendu \" she said with a shrug, she then looked down to the man who was placing the final pin her brother's trousers, \"These look much better\" she nodded, \"Yeah, I suppose they do\" he nodded, albeit begrudgingly, \"Chosen une putain tie for me then?\" The tailor made a sound of disgust at his use of profanity, and Toulouse realised that swearing in English would probably have been a better idea, Marie rolled her eyes at him, \"Yes, yes I have chosen you a tie, and I swear , you'll like it\" 0o0o0 The next day Marie collected Toulouse's newly tailored trousers on the way to his studio loft. Tonight was the night of the gallery opening, and he'd decided to prepare for it away from home to save their mother from making too much of a fuss over him- Marie would be bad enough anyway. She let herself into the studio as she normally would, straining with the three garment bags she had slung over her other arm. Luckily, Toulouse had heard her coming and intercepted her in the doorway, quickly taking the bags from her arm, before realising just how much she had brought with her, \"What's all of this? You were meant to be picking up my trousers!\" \" These are your trousers\" Marie insisted, tapping the top bag, \"And that's my dress for tonight\", \"And this?\" he added, indicating the final, much older looking garment bag, \"That's mine too\" she shrugged, hoping that her brother wouldn't notice the gentle blush that was blooming under her makeup. \"Okay\" the redhead nodded, none the wiser \"Come on, we better start getting ready\" he added, going to hand her clothes back, \"Oh, wait!\" she insisted, reaching into her handbag, \"Take this too\" she said, placing a small, folded paper bag on top of what he already held, \"What's this?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow, \"Your tie\" she laughed, hauling her garment bags back into her arms, \"Now go, get changed. I'll use the bedroom\" she said, heading for the side of the studio that contained the cot, therefore making it a 'bedroom' (in the very loosest interpretation of the word). The loft was essentially one large room, but with the help of some hung fabrics, and massive canvas', Toulouse had split the place into two smaller spaces. One for painting which was the bigger of the two: it was filled by two work tables, half a dozen easels and stacks of finished paintings. While the other part of the loft was tucked out of the way by a small window, it had a small uncomfortable cot, a tall mirror, and little else. Marie stepped into the bedroom space and laid her garment bags over the cot, before going over to the window and drawing the curtain across it. She went back to the bags, and unzipped the top one, revealing her ankle length, silver and pink beaded dress- she smiled fondly at it. It didn't take long for the woman to get changed, having gotten used to dressing in a hurry. Once she was happy with her appearance, she then regarded the second garment bag. Marie would admit that she had lied to Toulouse. At first, she absolutely had not intended to, when she agreed to dropping the idea of a waistcoat, she really had meant it, but on returning home that night and opening her wardrobe, an idea had struck her. It seemed like a wonderful idea, truly. But then, arriving at the loft, she had actively lied to him, that was also true, and yet it also wasn't . The second garment bag was for her, it was so she could dress Toulouse. She picked up the bag and draped it over her arm, heading back into the open space of the studio, Toulouse was stood in front of another, much more warped and dirtier mirror, tucking the bottom of his brand new, pristine white shirt, into the waistband of his perfectly fitting trousers. \"That's so much better\" the blonde said with a sigh, He turned to regard her, \"Not what I expected\" he said, pointing to his collar, A pale blue, untied bowtie lay draped about it, Marie laughed and approached him, hanging the old garment bag up on an easel as she went, \"Do you like it?\" she asked, reaching out to tie it for him, \"Yes actually\" \"Well don't sound so surprised!\" she teased, tightening it so it sat below his Adam's apple. Toulouse smiled softly, \"Thank you\" he said, nodding, Marie shook her head in response however and winced, \"Don't thank me, at least not yet\" \"Why not?\" her brother replied, blinking at her, \"Because I'm about to do something I said I wouldn't\" the blonde answered, biting her lip. She couldn't help the smile that began to spread across her face as she half skipped, half ran over to the garment bag, unzipping it in one smooth movement and pulling out the piece of clothing from within, brandishing it across her body to display it for him. \"A waistcoat?\" Toulouse asked with a sigh, \"But we agreed!\" \"I know, I know!\" she whined, \"But just try it on, please?\" The redhead stared at her for a long moment, and the sad but hopeful expression she was wearing, \"Oh, fine, but it does not mean I'll wear it!\" \"That's fine, just see what you think\" she replied, shaking her head and handing it to him, Her brother took the garment, feeling its soft texture in his hand- the back panel was silk as most waistcoats were, but he couldn't place the fabric that the front was composed of, \"What is this?\" he asked, rubbing his thumbs into it, watching as the colour changed slightly with the movement of the small, soft bristles. \"Suede\" Marie answered, perching on the edge of one of his tables after she had checked it was clean, \"Suede? I didn't even know they made waistcoats out of suede\" he said, threading it onto his arms and up to his shoulders, \"It is nice though\" he added quietly, Marie beamed, \"You like it?\" she asked, watching as he fastened each of the buttons and turned to regard himself in the mirror. Toulouse smiled begrudgingly and nodded, \"Yeah- yes. It's unique, I think\" he said, pulling it down to make sure it covered the waistband of his trousers, The piece was a sort of burnt sienna colour, not quite the orange red of his hair, but just as warm. His sister stood abruptly and rushed over to him, \"I was hoping you'd like it\" she said, going to wipe down the front of the waistcoat. She then took in a deep breath to steady herself and smiled at him, \"You look like father\" The redhead shrugged and looked past her to the mirror again, adjusting his bowtie a little, \"I guess I do look quite a bit like Tom\", The coincidence that he bore resemblance to their stepfather had escaped nobody's notice over the years, it had caused a few passing comments and jokes, but otherwise had been chalked up to a very obscure coincidence. \"No, I mean you look like father \" she repeated, tears inexplicably forming in the corners of her eyes, Toulouse's jaw dropped a little and he gave her and then himself a dumbfounded look, \"I- I guess I do a little\" Marie dropped her eyes and smiled at his outfit instead, \"This is his\" she added, putting her hands on his shoulders. \"What?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow, \"Hmm? Oh-\" the blonde looked him in the eye once more, \"-the waistcoat. The waistcoat was fathers. After we couldn't find anything at les boutiques , I thought this might do nicely. I found it in one of the trunks in the attic a few weeks ago\" Toulouse frowned and shook his head, \"Marie-\" She quickly interrupted him however, \"-I found some old photos of him wearing it too, do you want to see?\", she asked, turning away and reaching into her bag which she had stuffed a few of the images into. \"I can't wear this Marie\" he said, putting his hands to the last button, preparing to unfasten it, \"What?\" she asked, looking back to him, bringing the photos up to her chest, \"Why not? You said you liked it\", \"Because-\" he sighed trying to find the words, \"-Because it's not mine, it's father's waistcoat, and he-\" \"-And he would want you to wear it\" Marie said, cutting him off again. \"He was a military man Marie, and I'm an artist, they're hardly compatible\" Toulouse replied, frowning as he spoke, She looked devastated by his words, \"He was also a husband, and a father, and he would be so proud of you\" the blonde said, now sounding desperate, \"You need to wear the waistcoat Toulouse, it's perfect\", The redhead slipped his hands into his trouser pockets and looked down, away from her pleading expression, \"I don't know\", \"Please\" Marie said softly, then letting out a small, unamused laugh, \"I- I like to think that if he was still here, that that's what he would be wearing to your gallery opening. So if you wear it, it's a little like having him there\" her eyes were focused on the ground now. She was trying her very best not to cry, especially in front of Toulouse. \"Okay\" he said with a nod, \"I'll wear it\" The blonde released a shaky breath which became a delighted laugh, \"Thank you, thank you\" she nodded, throwing her arms about her brother and nestling her head into his chest, He stumbled back a little, but embraced her in return, \"I'll wear it\" he repeated, \"But if it gets stained, I accept absolutely no fault\", \"No\" Marie giggled, pulling away from him, \"Of course not\" she nodded, putting one hand to her cheek, and collecting the dampness from around her eyes before it could fall, \"So- will Berlioz be there tonight?\" 0o0o0 Berlioz stared thoughtfully at the painting before him. At least to the untrained eye, his gaze may have seemed thoughtful, but Thomas knew the reality; it was seven o'clock in the evening, and the young man was very, very hungover. \"This is very impressive\" Duchess said from his side, raising her champagne flute full of water to her mouth and taking a sip, \"Hmm?\" Tom replied, \"Oh, yeah\" he agreed, nodding obediently, \"I had no idea Toulouse had so many pieces in the studio, there must be about three or four dozen here, and the size of some of them\" she went on, shaking her head, \"I couldn't have imagined\" \"There are a lot\" the redhead replied coughing awkwardly, his tone then dropped and he stooped a little to make sure that only his wife heard his next words, \"Although, I think it would be fair to say that I understand next to none of them, how about you?\", Duchess smiled brightly, \"Oh, absolutely not\" she laughed. Thomas laughed too, but quickly lifted his drink to hide his amused expression as Toulouse entered the room, a broad smile on his face, \"I am very proud though\" she added, watching as her son went over to his brother, who looked entirely exhausted by his bright demeanour, but was at least trying to share the sentiment, \"I know you are\" he nodded, \"I am too you know\" \"Yes\" she nodded, looking up to him with a sentimental sort of smile, \"I know you are\", Tom could only return the look for a moment before it waned however, \"We should tell them soon\" he stated softly, once again making sure that they wouldn't be overheard, \"It might start to show\" \"Not tonight\" she said quickly, panicking, \"We can't do it tonight\", \"No, of course not\" Thomas replied, \"It's Toulouse's night\" he agreed, \"But, we don't want them to think we're keeping it from them\", \"Soon\" Duchess replied, promise in her words, \"I'll figure out the right time, and the right place\" she assured him, \"That's all that matter's\" the redhead nodded, taking up one of her hands, and bringing it to his mouth, \"I want you to be happy\" he said, his lips moving against her knuckles as he spoke, His wife blushed softly and nodded, \"Well I am, I'm very happy\" she nodded. \"Mother, Thomas!\" Marie then chirped, all but bounding over to the two of them, \"Marie\" Duchess responded, smiling at her daughter, \"You look beautiful darling\" she added, as they exchanged kisses to one another's cheeks, \"So do you\" she beamed, \"Evening Tom\" she added, offering him a hand, \"Good evening Marie\" he nodded, pecking one of her knuckles with a kiss, She then shuffled in between them, taking her mother's arm in her own, \"What do you think of Toulouse tonight?\" she asked eagerly, \"I'm very proud of him\" Duchess answered, \"As I am of all of you\", \"Of course\" the young woman nodded, hardly stifling the roll of her eyes, \"But I meant his outfit\", The elder looked her son over once more, one eyebrow raised, \"He looks very handsome\" she said with a nod, \"I take it you dressed him?\" \"Mmm hmm\" Marie nodded, a gentle giggle bubbling in her chest, \"It looks- it looks a little familiar?\" Duchess then suggested, tilting her head, as if seeking out a new angle, Her daughter beamed proudly, squeezing her arm a little more tightly, \" Father \" she whispered simply. The breath caught in her throat for a moment as she observed her son, her gaze latching to the warm coloured, suede waistcoat, \"Of course\" she nodded, fond memories of the garment coming to mind, \"It's perfect\" she then added, before pressing a soft kiss into her daughter's hair.

Small, white and Black. Shy and not too fond of strangers. Very carrying yet timid. Beau; Second youngest of Duchess and O'Malley's new litter. Sassy, loud, hopeless romantic, and can be annoying at times. White and orange. Mathieu; Eldest of the second litter. All brown. Smart, Brave, Adventurous, and has a big heart (The year is 1911, Madame has passed away. A new housekeeper named Lucille has taken over Edgar's job. Duchess and O'Malley have just had a new litter.) Intro \"Aren't they just gorgeous?\" Duchess asked O'Malley, as she looked upon her brand new litter of kittens. She motioned her head at her new daughter. \"She looks like you.\" O'Malley smiled and whispered into Duchess' ear \"Just beautiful. Beau-tiful. Beau- I mean Beautiful.\" \"No, no, no I like Beau. Her name shall be Beau. But what about him?\" She stared at her new son. \"Why, I can't think of anything!\" O'Malley pondered for a while. No names crossed his mind. \"Malley-Mark-Mathieu!\" He thought out loud. \"I love it.\" She whispered, \"Well, I guess two works. I was expecting more I guess. Ummm, maybe you should check up on Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz. Tell them, they can see the new ones in the morning. I'm quite tired. Maybe I should just get some rest.\" She nuzzled against O'Malley. He walked out of the room almost skipping. \"Love that cat,\" She thought to herself. The cat door closed shut. \"THOMAS! THOMAS! THOMAS!\" Was the sound that made Thomas O'Malley run down stairs as right as he was about to tuck in Marie. (Who were now 11) \"Thoughts rushed in and out of his head. \"Did something happen with a kitten? Is one of them missing? Is she in pain or maybe she's sick?\" He ran down the stairs nearly slipping on a fake mouse \"Duchess? Babe? Hon?\" He called out as he walked down the basement stairs. \"Another one.\" She remarked. \"Another one.\" \"Hunh?\" He mumbled. He stared down at her bed. A small black and white bundle of fur was all curled up next to Duchess. \"Leá\" She said.\"Her name is Leá\" Leá squirmed herself in between both of Duchess' paws.[Chapter 2] Chapter One (Seven weeks later) Beau slowly crawled into her newfound hiding couch cushions were perfect for hide and seek. Her brother would never find her here. \"Ready or not here I come!\" Mathieu yelled from the parlor. He raced to one of sofas, bumping into Berlioz on his way. Berlioz held Mathieu by his tail. \"Outta my way! I'm need to find Beau! She cannot win 3 days in a row!\"He exclaimed. \"Wait- I'm sorry for bumping into you. Now please let me go.\" \"I have an idea. How about we just quit this game. It's dangerous.\" Berlioz said releasing his tail. \"Whdya mean? Just leave Beau in the couch cushions? No! I finally found her!\" Mathieu yelled pointing in her direction. He ignored Berlioz's advice and pounced on top of the couch. He lifted part of the cushion up and saw Beau's tail. He swiped at it and said \"GOTCHA!\" Beau popped her head out. \"BERLIOZ?! WHY'D YOU GIVE MY SPOT AWAY?!\" Beau screamed. She hopped off the couch and trotted into the main room. \"Mama, mama, Mathieu scratched my tail! Look!\" She whined. She pointed to her tail which had a small red scratch on the side. \"Beau, you should really stop playing that game! It's very dangerous!\" Duchess proclaimed. \"Sorry mama.\" Beau whimpered. \"Now where's Leá?\" Duchess questioned while cleaning herself off. \"She's with Father and Marie having a music lesson. Berlioz said he will be joining shortly. Don't you remember?\" Beau asked. \"I can't seem to remember anything nowadays...\" Duchess exclaimed, \"I think I need a nap- I'll be right back- tell Berlioz he's incharge for now.\" \"Okay Mama.\" Beau replied. She walked downstairs to the dining room to take a quick glimpse of the city. Carriages and cars were roaming on the streets, but one particular car caught her sight. It seemed to be driving to the Mansion. \"What's going on?\" She thought to herself. The car drove out of her sight, and Beau was bored again. Her thoughts returned to the street. Uncle Scat Cat was chasing after a mouse with his friends (as usual), A young couple was window shopping (a common sight), and more carriages and cars passed. KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK Beau went to the window outside the door to see who it , the housekeeper came to the door. She opened it and a middle aged woman in all black was there. \"Is this the Bonfamille residence?\" The mysterious lady asked with a scowl. \"Yes it is...\" Lucille answered a little taken back by the lady's anger in her voice. Beau slowly eyed her from a distance. She was tall and skinny- a little too skinny- it almost seemed as if she had the diameter of a twig. \"My name is Agatha. I'm moving soon, and someone said there was a sale here.\" She replied peeking her head in to see the grand staircase. \"Well, I'm sorry but, this house is not for sale-\" Lucille informed. \"Not the house! The cats! I'm moving to New York City and I need a few traveling companions.\" Agatha remarked with a slight smirk. \"Well, the cats are simply not for sale! They belong to this house.\" She said. \"I need to see your papers.\" She demanded, \"If these cats are your's you can keep them-if not, they belong to me.\" \"Ruckus!\" Lucille argued and shut the door, and muttered words that even a dog with the best ears couldn't hear. Beau ran into the kitchen where Toulouse was eating his daily snack. \"Did ya hear that?!\" Beau interrupted. \"Fut?\" Toulouse gurgled with food still in his mouth. \"Where gonna be sold!\" She informed him, \"To a scary witch lady! She's was wearing all-black and wants to take us away from this house!\" \"Are thoo thoor?\" He chewed. \"I'm postive sure! Times ten! I over heard them! Her name is Agatha- and we're gonna be kidnapped!\" She cried. Toulouse finished his food then spoke. \"I don't always believe you Beau, but if you want I can inform the others.\" He moaned. He marched off, almost certain Beau and Leá were pulling a prank on him. He headed into the main room where he found Marie, O'Malley, Berlioz, and Leá finishing up Leá's music lesson \"So Fa Mi Re Do!\" Leá sang. Marie and O'Malley started clapping while Berlioz finished up the last few notes of the song. \"Magnifique!\" Marie exclaimed, clapping her hands rapidly. \"Bravo!\" Toulouse commented from the corner of the room. \"Toulouse!\" Leá yelled running over to her eldest brother to give him a hug. \"Did you like my singing?\" She said releasing her grasp. \"It was better then Madame singing opera!\" Toulouse claimed. \"Who's Madame?\" Leá questioned. Toulouse stared at his father. \"You didn't tell them?\" He asked. O'Malley looked at the floor. ","Summary":" New Characters; Leá; Youngest kitten. Small, white and Black.

Normally she slept in on Saturday mornings. But not today. It was 5:45 AM, and Elsa had big plans. Two weeks ago, Elsa noticed that Victor was paying more attention to her than usual in science class, a class that was now taught by a gym teacher. Was Victor really attracted to her? Or was it because Mr. Rzykruski was gone? Then at lunch, Victor asked Elsa if she would marry him, presenting her with a fake but nevertheless pretty ring. \"I can't marry you right now!\" Elsa laughed. \"I'm only nine. I'll have to wait at least nine years!\" \"Well, how about the next closest thing?\" Victor asked, not giving up easily. \"What do you mean?\" \"We pretend to get married. Think of it as a dress rehearsal.\" \"I don't know. My uncle might not like this idea.\" \"You don't have to ask his permission, and neither do I. We can walk to the New Holland Church early in the morning on a Saturday while your uncle and my parents are asleep. No one else will be there but us. And we won't be breaking any laws. The only way we would be breaking the law is if we asked for a marriage license and lied about our ages to get it.\" \"This upcoming Saturday is too soon. How about next Saturday?\" \"Excellent. See you there,\" Victor said with a smile. Elsa now had something more pleasant to look forward to than the monotony of elementary school. But she had to surpress her joy for the time being. Even though they were in a quiet part of the cafeteria, she hoped no one overheard them. She wanted to pull this off without anyone finding out. As she walked home from school, her mind was in overdrive. She needed to buy a dress, and she needed to practice sneaking in and out if she could. The possibility of failure worried her, but the possibility of success and the desire for Victor's affection excited her. Keep reading to see if she succeeds...[Chapter 2] Elsa sprinted home, full of excitement. She raced to her room and counted her money. She had $105.12. There was more money in her bank account, but she didmnot want to take any money out of it if she could avoid it. Now all the money she had made selling lemonade and doing basic chores was about to pay off. Next, she pulled out a map of New Holland. There was a shopping center within walking distance of New Holland Elementary. She would make a stop there tomorrow during the lunchtime recess period. If there was an outfit she could afford, great. If not, maybe she could sell some toys or personal items she no longer wanted for extra money. She stuffed a few in a paper bag that she no longer needed or wanted. She spent the rest of the afternoon completing her work, and then it was time for dinner. \"What's that shiny metal object on your finger?\" asked her uncle. \"It's just a cheap fake ring,\" Elsa replied. \"Victor gave it to me.\" \"How charming,\" her uncle remarked. \"I just hope your relationship doesn't progress too much too soon.\" The next day, Elsa ate her lunch and took off in record time. She headed for the department store at the shopping center and, to her astonishment, found a white dress she adored for only $11.50.. It had a wide skirt, and came with a headpiece, a veil, and white slippers. Apparently it was meant for some occasion called a first communion. She purchased the dress and raced back to school. Finding the dress and buying it was easy. Getting it back home without anyone noticing-especially her uncle-would be harder. The dress came in an elegant white box. She saw a discarded paper bag from the grocery store nearby, and placed the box inside. Boy, was she lucky. She carried the bag like it was a regular grocery bag. Now she could return to school without drawing a lot of attention to herself. She placed the box in her locker, and finished off her school day. Then she realized she had another problem. Her uncle would certainly notice her carrying this huge grocery bag home. How could she take her dress home without her uncle finding out? Elsa's question will be answered in the next chapter...[Chapter 3] Elsa could not bring the dress home in her box. She could not think of a lie to explain why she was carrying a grocery bag. And what if she dropped the bag or her uncle peeked inside? Maybe she could wear her white dress underneath the outfit she usually wore to school. She snuck into the girls' room to see if that idea would be plausible. It wasn't. The dress was too long. She went back to her locker, frantically searching through it to find something, anything that might provide a solution. There was nothing. It looked like she would need to bring everything home over the course of several trips. She could place the headpiece and veil in her lunchbox and bring that home today, and then bring her white shoes home in the lunchbox tomorrow. After doing that, she decided she needed to ask Victor for help. Her opportunity came at that day's lunch period. \"Victor, will you be carrying home anything big in the next week or two?\" asked Elsa. \"On Friday, I'll be carrying home a bicycle pedal generator I built in a cardboard box,\" answered Victor. \"Why do you ask?\" Chapter 4 is next...[Chapter 4] That following Saturday morning, Elsa got up earlier than she had ever had before. She tiptoed down the stairs, without using a flashlight. Her breathing was done through her nose. It was quieter that way. She peeked into the backyard. There was a brown paper bag by the left side of the fence. Her package had arrived. One week later, she got up early again. First, she removed her ponytails. Her hair looked more grown-up that way. Then she brushed her hair. Finally, she put on her white dress, shoes, and headpiece. Once again, she walked down the stairs in the dark. Her heart was pounding. Were all brides as nervous on their wedding day as she was right now? She reached the front door and turned the knob. She opened the front door. The sun was just beginning to rise. And there were no clouds in the sky. Perfect. She opened the screen door and closed the front door. Then she let go of the screen door. BANG! Oh, no! Had anyone heard her? Her heartbeat now sounded like a muffled jackhammer. She waited a minute. Then two minutes. She took a long, deep breath to calm herself and continued on. Be still, fluttering heart. Be still. When she reached the church, the sun had completely risen. She walked up the steps, and tripped and fell on her dress before reaching the top of the stairway. She stood up and carefully examined her dress. Thankfully, it was neither dirty nor torn. A glance at her reflection off of the glass in front of the church's signage made her gasp. She had done a great job getting all dressed up in total darkness. Her hair was perfectly combed and her headpiece was perfectly straight. She was more than ready now. She eagerly flung open the door. And there was Victor at the altar. She had seen Victor wearing a gray sport coat and red tie in church before, but today, he looked even more handsome. He was in a jet-black tuxedo, and he looked like he could be an orchestra conductor. \"You look beautiful,\" Victor complimented. \"Thank you,\" Elsa answered. Victor turned around, switching on a record player to play Richard Wagner's \"Bridal Chorus.\". Elsa waltzed down the aisle. Victor pretended to be the minister for a few minutes. Then they exchanged vows. They also exchanged rings, fake rings of course. They did everything but kiss. Victor put on another record, and they started to dance. \"Victor?\" \"Elsa?!\" Astonished, Victor and Elsa froze in their tracks. Victor's mother and father were at the front door of the church, along with Elsa's uncle. \"H-how did you find us?\". Elsa stammered. \"Sparky and Persephone led the way,\" answered Victor's mother. And then Sparky and Persephone entered the church. Sparky was in a perfect straight line with Victor, and Persephone was in a perfect straight line with Elsa. All that's left is the conclusion...[Chapter 5] Victor and Elsa could have been grounded. Victor and Elsa could have been ordered to return their nice clothes to the department store for full refunds. Victor and Elsa could have lost their allowances. Victor and Elsa could have been ordered to do extra chores. But they both received an even worse punishment. They had to pose for pictures from both Victor's dad and Elsa's uncle. For what seemed like hours. First at the altar. Then outside the church. Followed by a romantic garden. Looking directly into the sun. And that was just the pictures of just the two of them. Then there were solo pictures. And pictures of Victor with Sparky. And pictures of Elsa with Persephone. And pictures of all four of them. The End. Please review and let me know what you think!

It was Friday, March 12th, and Elsa Van Helsing was on her way home from her job as an archivist for the New Holland Historical Society. Normally, when Elsa headed home from work, her weekends were quiet and uneventful. She would read books she had checked out from the local library and play with Persephone. But this weekend was no ordinary weekend. Tomorrow, she would be marrying the man of her dreams, Victor Frankenstein. Her emotions about the wedding ceremony were very strong, and she was not good at hiding them. They alternated between pure joy and absolute terror, rarely finding any balance in between. She would have felt pure joy 100% of the time after accepting Victor's proposal last December if she knew that it would just be a simple ceremony with just her, Victor, her parents, her uncle, and Victor's parents. However, her uncle was still the mayor and he was determined to give Elsa a wedding fit for royalty whether she liked it or not. And Elsa's words advising restraint had no power over her uncle. The ceremony was to be held tomorrow at 2 pm at the Trinity Lutheran Church, with hundreds of guests. She would be wearing a long poufy dress with a veil and a tiara. The reception would have a cake three feet in diameter and three feet tall. It would be just as bad as Dutch Day. And she imagined Victor would be just as nervous as she was. No, it wouldn't be as bad as Dutch Day. Dutch Day was for her uncle's enjoyment along with the town's. Tomorrow's ceremony and party would be mainly for her and Victor. Victor would forgive her if she messed up-hopefully. But what about the guests? There were hundreds of guests and only one Victor. She did not want to be remembered for the wrong reasons. She took a long deep breath to calm herself. Then she opened the door. She wished that her emotional state could be consistent at least, instead of her feelings swinging from joy to fear like a clock's pendulum. Now it was time to wash up for dinner with her parents and her uncle. To be continued...[Chapter 2] \"So, Elsa, do you have any last-minute requests for tomorrow?\" asked Uncle Burgermeister. \"No, I think you have everything covered,\" Elsa replied. Everything that you want, instead of what I want. \"Here's the final guest list for tomorrow,\" said Elsa's mother, handing her a typewritten list of names with multiple pages. All the names were people she had not heard of. All of them were total strangers to her. All except one. Mr. Rzykruski. Victor would certainly be glad to see him. He often said while he liked and respected all his teachers, Mr. Rzykruski would always be his favorite. She wondered what his life had been like since he got fired from New Holland Elementary. Now both she and Victor would get to find out. Maybe that would make the wedding reception more pleasant for her. She continued through the list and encountered just three other familiar names. Nassor. Toshiaki. Weird Girl. Maybe it would be worth it to talk with them. For the first time in a long time, Elsa began to feel more relaxed. That feeling lasted for several minutes. She finished her dinner, said goodnight to everyone, and went upstairs to her room. As she took a shower, dried off, and changed into her nightgown, a scary idea popped into her mind. What if the electricity goes out, and all four of us oversleep and miss the ceremony? She did not, I repeat, DID NOT want that to happen. There was no one in the world like Victor Frankenstein, and she had no desire to betray him, even accidentally. If she lost Victor, she would probably die alone. So she tried to think of something to ensure she would wake up in time. She couldn't. Heading downstairs to the family bookshelf in the living room, she flipped through books to find a solution. She had not one, not two, but three alarm clocks set to go off simultaneously at 10:00 AM. Two were plugged into a wall outlet, and the third was battery-powered. And she had no way of knowing how much energy was left in the batteries. Finally, she thought of something. Normally, she slept with the drapes closed. Tonight, she would sleep with the drapes open. If the power grid failed and the batteries failed, the sun would not fail. It was a beautiful night outside. There were plenty of stars and the moon was full. But she could not enjoy the night sky for long. She had to go to sleep. The words \"Go to sleep\" sound so easy, so simple for most of us. Elsa Van Helsing was not most of us. Nor would she ever be. Elsa's mind was racing like a rocket engine with an inexhaustible fuel supply. Asking Elsa to relax at this point would be like walking up to a tornado and asking it to disappear. She realized that tonight would be the last night she ever slept in this bed. Ever. Tomorrow, her life would be changed forever. But was she ready for that? What if I trip and fall as I walk down the aisle? What if it rains tomorrow? What if I get so sick tomorrow morning that I can't even get out of bed? What if I step on Victor's feet when we dance at the reception? What if I mess up my vows? Her vows would be a simple \"I do\", but she had read somewhere that your choice of words comprised only seven percent of your speech. The other 93 percent consisted of tone of voice and body language. What if the minister heard the nervousness that was sure to be in her voice, or saw something in her body language that he did not like, and interpreted Elsa's response as insincere? Would the minister give Elsa a second chance? Or a third? Or would he give up and refuse to pronounce them husband and wife? That was Elsa's greatest fear. She dreaded saying \"I do\" only to hear the words, \"No you don't. You don't want to marry Victor. I can see it on your face and I can hear it in your voice. You have wasted my time and the time of everyone you invited. You're a disgrace to my congregation and to this entire town. Get out of my church, and don't ever come back.\" If that happened, Elsa would welcome death more than she ever had before. Her heart was now fluttering faster than the wings of a hummingbird. There was no way she could fall asleep now. But she had to fall asleep. She did not want to faint from exhaustion in front of everyone. She thought about leaving the house and going for a short walk. She then decided not to, not wanting to wake anyone up. In the preceding weeks, Elsa had wondered if she would be an adequate wife for Victor. And she also wondered if she could handle being the center of attention for so many hours. Now Elsa had an even bigger question. Could she even fall asleep? Chapter 3 is coming soon.[Chapter 3] Elsa closed her eyes. She wanted her brain to shut down. But it could not. Her brain did not have a power switch for her to flip. So many things that were so easy for others to control were so hard for Elsa. Everyone else always seemed to be able to control the volume and speed of their voice effortlessly. But not Elsa. Everyone else always seemed to be able to keep all their negative emotions contained inside their bodies. But not Elsa. Elsa's emotions were impossible for her to hide. What if the minister really did see something on her face or hear something in her voice that caused him to disregard her vows? Would Victor turn against her? Or would he rush to her defense? What would her uncle think? What would her parents think? What would all the guests think? Elsa could not take it anymore. She needed to fall asleep, and soon. She decided to work off her nervous energy, and hopefully she would fall asleep from exhaustion. So she elevated both her legs and kicked them back and forth. It was enjoyable-at first. But after several minutes, her feet began to feel like pins were inside them. The area around her stomach began to feel painful as well. Then pain spread through her whole legs. Eventually, Elsa wore herself and stopped. But the strategy worked. Elsa fell fast asleep. Please stay with me for Chapter 4...[Chapter 4] \"Do you, Victor Frankenstein, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?\" \"I do.\" \"And do you, Elsa Van Helsing, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?\" \"By the power vested in me by the State Of Pennsylvania, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You-\" WHOOOOOSH! A geyser of oil shot from the ground, directly between Elsa and Victor. The oil hit the church ceiling and began raining to the ground, splattering Elsa's wedding gown, Victor's tuxedo, the minister's robe, and all of the guests. Everyone began running for the exit. When the church was emptied, it appeared the danger was over. It wasn't. The ground began to shake violently. Large cracks started to appear in the ground. Everyone panicked, not knowing which way to run. And then sinkholes began to open up in the ground. Victor! Where was Victor? She looked to her left and saw Mr. Rzykruski. For a split second. Before he fell into a sinkhole. She looked to her right and saw Victor's parents off in the distance. Elsa ran towards them, but then they too disappeared into a sinkhole. Now Elsa was completely and utterly terrified. Then the worst happened. The once level horizon shot upwards and tilted at a dramatic angle. Elsa was falling, falling down an endless chasm, falling toward certain death. For a long time, Elsa could see nothing but gray soil all around her. Then she saw an orangish yellow glow at the bottom. It was lava! Instead of an instant death from hitting the hard ground, Elsa was going to slowly be melted alive! \"NOOOOOOOOOO!\" Elsa cried, so loudly you could hear her over a jet engine. But then Elsa's environment changed again. She was no longer falling. She looked around to find herself still safely in bed. It was only a nightmare. But it seemed real. Too real. Her uncle and parents rushed in. Elsa reassured everyone she was all right and apologized over and over again. When Elsa had her bedroom to herself again, she found that now she was more apprehensive than she had ever been in her entire life. More apprehensive than she was before performing as the Little Dutch Girl. More apprehensive than she was making the valedictorian speech at her high school graduation. But it was still dark out. There was nothing she could do but wait. She wanted to go back to sleep, but was now afraid to. She had woken everyone up prematurely and probably scared them out of their minds. Not something that she wanted to repeat. She looked at the clock and wished it would spin. Better yet, she wished that she would mentally black out, and when she came to her senses, the wedding ceremony and reception would be over, and she and Victor would be on their way to London for their honeymoon. Elsa wondered if she was the only bride more excited about her honeymoon than about her wedding ceremony and reception. But sadly, there was nothing she could do but wait for the sun to rise and hope for the best. This story is still under construction...[Chapter 5] Elsa had to get back to sleep. What if she fell asleep walking down the aisle? Or in the middle of dancing at the reception? She needed to get back into a pleasant mindframe somehow. But how? Looking around her room, she tried to find something that would help her. And she did. It was a jar of perfume next to notebook paper. And there was a pencil nearby. She opened the perfume bottle and took a sniff. Then she sketched in grayscale what she imagined her wedding day portrait would look like. Victor was completed first, followed by her. After Elsa finished her drawing, she climbed into bed and quickly fell asleep. She dreamed again. This time, her dream was more pleasant. She dreamed that she had magical powers. Specifically, she had the power to form objects out of chocolate. First, she thought of a chocolate bunny, and one appeared in her right hand. She then started making larger items. A small chocolate tree came next, followed by a chocolate house. She was in the middle of building a chocolate castle when she woke up. It was early in the morning. 8:15 AM. Elsa now felt wonderful. Ecstatic. She felt like she had infinite energy, as if she had slept for a hundred years. Elsa made herself breakfast. When she finished, she patiently waited for her uncle and parents to wake up. At 10:00 AM, her parents and uncle awoke. All four of them took showers and proceeded to get dressed. Elsa began to hum the wedding tune she would soon be hearing as she got ready. First she put on her white satin bridal slippers, both of which featured bows over the segment covering her toes. Then she put on her gown. It was an elegant gown with a wide skirt that almost touched the ground-almost. The gown also featured long sleeves, diamonds and elaboratey detailed lace. Now to comb her hair. That was a normally quick task. However, there was one segment of hair that refused to stay down, a curl in a mass of straight hair. So she went to ask her mother for help. But she did not wish to sound too negative. \"How do I look?\" Elsa asked her mother, who was wearing a long royal blue dress. \"Absolutely astonishingly beautiful,\" her mother answered. \"Even with this?\" Elsa pointed to the errant strands of hair. \"Not everything can be perfect,\" her mother responded. They returned to Elsa's room, and her mother crowned Elsa with the tiara and the diamond-studded veil, which completely concealed the curl. Elsa gasped in amazement. Was this real or was she dreaming? She pinched herself. This was real. Her pleasant dream last night had put in her in an amazingly upbeat mood in reality. She began to twirl in her dress until her uncle sternly said, \"Hold it!\" A camera flash. From her father's camera. Elsa posed for multiple pictures by herself. Then with her mother. Then her uncle. Then her father. Eventually, Elsa said, \"How many more pictures do we have to take? I don't want to be late for my own wedding.\" Her father chuckled and answered, \"A bride is expected to be late for her wedding.\" Elsa frowned, but her frown was barely visible, she was so happy. \"Just twelve.\" After those twelve photos were taken, they all climbed into the limousine and headed for the church. Everything that happened afterwards was like a wonderful dream-only real. Elsa's father walked her down the aisle. The minister spoke his sermon. Victor said, \"I do.\" Elsa also said, \"I do.\". And she never sounded happier or more sincere in her entire life when she said those two words. Victor and Elsa exchanged rings. Then they kissed. They turned to face the crowd, and then walked down the aisle, out of the church, past the guests showering them with rice, and into the limo for the reception. At the reception, not only did they eat cake and dance the night away, they reconnected with old friends. Weird Girl had become a psychoanalyst, and was in the process of writing a book on dream interpretation. Toshiaki and Nassor had started their own Japanese sushi restaurant. Mr. Rzykruski had been working for the past several years as an science exhibit curator for the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. Then the reception ended, and Victor and Elsa returned to Victor's house. \"Thank you for giving me the greatest and happiest day of my life,\" said Elsa. \"My goal is to make tomorrow even greater and happier for you,\" answered Victor. Tomorrow would be the day they left for London, their first full day as Victor and Elsa Frankenstein. The End. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: \"Frankenweenie\" belongs to The Walt Disney Company. It was Friday, March 12th, and El"},{"Movie":"Frankenweenie","Title":"Until The End","Author":"familyisimportant","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9959822","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Sparky sat on the bench with the baseball team. He watched his brother Victor step up to bat. Sparky Frankenstein looked almost exactly like his brother. The only difference was their hair styles and eye colors. Victor had his hair cut short; his green eyes were serious, like the rest of him. Sparky's eyes were gold, and sparked with life and mischief. His bangs were tucked behind his right ear. The rest of his hair was cut short, like his brother's. Their parents once told him the spark in his eyes was what led them to call their youngest by three minutes 'Sparky'. \"Come on, bro, we need a home run.\" he whispered under his breath. He leapt up and cheered louder and more excitedly when his brother hit the ball, sending it out of the park. The ball team's coach looked over at the twelve-year-old boy. \"Spark, go get it.\" Sparky nodded as he ran towards the ball. \"Right.\" he said over his shoulder. When he crossed paths with his brother, they high-fived each other. Sparky knelt in the middle of the road, and scooped the baseball up. He did not hear the car coming behind him, he was too busy thinking about the excellent hit his brother did, just as he started to straighten up, he noticed the car. It was too late to get out-of-the-way. He gave a cry as the car hit him. Victor stopped when he heard his brother's shout, and turned in the direction of his voice. He wished he didn't. Sparky lay lifeless in the middle of the road. Victor ran towards his twin. 'Please be okay.' he chanted to himself. When he got to the sidewalk, it was painfully clear he was not okay. He might never be okay again. He gave a cry of \"NO!\" and ran to Sparky's side. \"Spark, wake up. You have to wake up!\" he whimpered, patting his face. Sparky had a deep, long gash on his forehead, and cuts on his cheeks. \"Victor!\" he looks up at his father's voice. \"He needs help!\" Victor called back as his brother stirred in his arms. He was already fumbling in his coat pocket for his handkerchief and pressing it to his brother's forehead when Sparky's eyes flickered open. \"Victor?\" he managed to gasp out, breaking into a fit of coughing. Victor's grip tightened around his brother. \"Yes, it's me, Spark. Don't; don't talk, just save your strength.\" Sparky shook his head weakly. \"I'm sorry, brother.\" he gasped as a shudder ran down his frame, then he was still, his eyes slipped shut for ever. He would never see again. \"Sparky! Don't go!\" he screamed out, shaking his brother's shoulder. He felt his mom and dad put one hand on each of his shoulders. \"He's gone son.\" his mom told him gently. Victor shook his head, but he knew his mom was right. Then, he noticed Sparky's bangs had fallen over his right eye. He gently brushed them back behind his ear, and began to cry. The next day at school, the new science teacher looked over the class with disgust. They did not even try. Only Victor seemed interested in the lessons. He looked at Victor, his eyes softened. Like all the others in New Holland, he had heard of the death of Victor's beloved younger twin brother, Sparky. He knew exactly what he was going to try to teach the class that day. Even though he was really trying to pound it into their skulls for Victor, who was sadly drawing his twin's face in his notebook. When he mentioned electricity-if the concentration was high enough-could give life, the boy perked right up. That night Victor moved quietly, purposely, towards a particular grave in the grave yard. He removed a large form from the coffin, and gently put it in a sack. He carried his precious bundle to his house, and into the attic. He sewed some parts of the bundle, and gave it a brotherly hug. \"Everything is going to be okay.\" He whispered, as the thunder started. He hosted his brother's form through the roof, and after a few minutes, lowered it again. He put his scope to his brother's chest, and did not hear anything. He threw the scope to the side and held his brother's hand as he sobbed into his still chest. \"I'm sorry, brother.\" he said then froze when he felt Sparky's chest rise, he groaned as his hand tightened around Victor's.[Chapter 2] Victor's eyes grew wide with a nervous hope. \"Sparky?\" he whispered, gently removing the sheets from his brother's face with his free hand, the second still in his brother's grip. Sparky's eyes flickered, and then opened. It did not take them long to focus on his sibling. \"Victor?\" he gasped out, then gave a dry cough. \"Stay here, I'll get you some water.\" Victor ran to do so, not noticing his brother sit up and look around. He did not understand- why was he at the house? He remembered the accident all too well. He had knelt to get the baseball, and as he started to stand up, when he saw the car. He felt a flash of burning pain. He woke to his brother cradling him, then nothing. He did not even know how he could come to be sitting on a metal slab in the attic. Wait a minute. Nothing, when he lost consciousness for the second time, he didn't feel anything. It was as if he died and came back. Then, he took a good look around. The metal bed he was sitting on was surrounded by metal objects. Something told him his brother was behind this. Then Victor returned and quietly handed Sparky a cup of water. He took the cup from Victor, and drank gratefully. If they were going to talk, he at least wanted to get rid of the dryness in his throat. When he was done, he put the empty cup next to him and looked at his brother. \"Victor, did you,\" he gestured to the room, then himself. Victor looked down, and nodded. \"Yeah.\" Sparky reached out his left arm to try to comfort his twin, when it fell off. He stared at his arm, at Victor, then back at his arm. He started to chuckle, which turned into a snicker then a full out laugh. Victor looked up with a mixture of surprise and hope in his eyes. \"Come over here so I can try to hug you without losing my right arm too!\" He said teasingly. Victor practically ran over to him. They nearly crushed each other in the embrace. Then, Victor picked the arm up, and gently started to sew it back onto his brother as he watched. \"I need to show you how to do this in case it happens when I'm not here.\" he murmured, then added \"I missed you, Spark.\" \"I missed you too, Vic.\" Downstairs, Victor's father went over to his wife and placed his arm over her shoulder as she cried. He was as upset as she was. When Sparky had died in the road, he was screaming internally as loud as Victor was. After all, he had lost his son. He needed to be strong, for Victor. Nether he or Victor's mom knew of the reunion going on right above their heads.[Chapter 3] The next day, Victor went up to the attic. He would have to get to school soon. \"I wish I can come with you,\" Sparky murmured. That was one thing he missed, going places with his brother. Victor gave his bro a quick hug. \"I know, Spark. But I don't want anyone to know about you. They might not understand.\" He let go, holding his brother's shoulders. \"What are you going to do while I am in school?\" Sparky shrugged his shoulders. \"Don't know. I might just relax in the yard. Don't worry, Vic, I doubt anyone will see me. I cannot stay in the attic all the time, I'll go crazy!\" he stuck out his tongue and drew circles near his ear with his finger, making Victor laugh. \"Alright, just be careful, bro.\" Sparky bounced the baseball against the wall of the house. \"Hey, Spark.\" he leapt up a good three feet, dropping the ball. He turned, and his face felt warm. There, smiling at him from across the gate, was Persephone Van Helsing, Elsa's sister. \"Hey, hey, Persephone, what are you doing?\" then he realized, she did not know. \"I have not seen you in a while.\" he murmured, looking down, hoping she did not see the flush on his cheeks. She gave him a warm smile. \"I just got back today. I didn't tell my sister. I wanted it to be a surprize.\" then, her cheerful behaviour became worried. \"Are you okay? You're hurt.\" Sparky fumbled around in his head for an escus. \"Um yeah, I err, got into an argument with a car. I was allowed out of the hospital yesterday, so,\" God, why did he always feel uncomfortable talking to her? She winced and nodded her head in understanding. \"Ouch.\" During their conversation, Sparky had got closer to the fence. They continued to talk, and Persephone's hand absently touched Sparky's. There was a bolt of electricity and both tweens were sent flying to separate ends of their yards. \"Are you okay?\" Sparky yelped as he rushed back to see Persephone getting to her feet. \"Yeah, I'm okay, are you?\" he nodded his head. He did not think he could answer out loud without laughing. Persephone's hair was sticking straight up, a bolt of it had turned white. She noticed the time, and gave a yelp. \"I better get inside. They will be home soon.\" he watched as she ran inside, and turned to go in himself. \"Sparky?\" he turned with a small gulp. Just as he feared, Egor. He turned back to his house, and ran inside.[Chapter 4] Footsteps were coming slowly up the stairs. Sparky carefully lifted the nearest thing, a pan, and hid behind the attic door. He gave a sigh of relief and lowered it. Victor looked around when Sparky cried out, \"What are you trying to do,give me a heart attack?!\" Victor turned around at his brother's voice. \"Sparky, what are you doing with that frying pan?\" he asked, staring at the pan his brother still held in his hand. Sparky looked blankly at the frying pan. Then, he thew it aside, laughing nervously. \"Oh, that. Well, ah, you see-\" Victor looked at him, \"Just spit it out, Spark.\" he said, deadpan. Sparky took a deep breath.\"I-thought-you-were-Egor-comming-to-look-for-me.-So-I-had-the-pan-to-defend-myself.\"after the rush, Sparky gasped for breath as Victor stared at him. \"Why would Egor come after you?\" Sparky told him of meeting Persephone in her yard, how she did not know what happened. \"After our conversation , she went inside. I started to come in through the back, when Egor spotted me. I ran inside, and thought you were him. Sorry about that.\" he added, looking at his shoes. Victor did not know if he should be mad at his brother, or try to comfort him. He decided on the second choice. He placed a hand on Sparky's shoulder. \"Sparky,\" he began. Before he could finish, their mom called for him. The two brothers traded terrified looks, and Victor rushed down the steps. Elsa smiled at her sister as they ate. When she returned from school to her uncle's house, she did not expect to se Persephone sitting quietly on the couch. Finally, said sister broke the silence. \"I saw Sparky today.\" she said softly, her face blushing as she stared at her food. She did not see the effect that simple fact had on the rest of her family. Elsa dropped her fork as their uncle choked on a piece of steak. Elsa bit the inside of her tongue. She could not, will not, tell her sister that her crush was ran over and killed two days before. Her uncle had no such qualms. \"Impossible,he's dead!\" he snapped at her. Elsa faceplamed. Her uncle did not care for the Frankenstine family,and did not improve of their friendships with their sons. She stole a glance at Persephone. Her face was pale, her hands clutched the table. \"No,\" she whispered. Then she gave her uncle a furious glare. \"No, you're lying!\" she leapt up, and ran up the stairs to the bedroom she shared with her sister. Elsa shook her head and without a word went to comfort her. Their room had two beds, one empty the other containing the sobbing form of her sister. She reached over and placed a hand on her shoulder. \"He is lying Elsa, I know I saw Spark.\" This was not going the way Elsa thought it would. \"Are you sure it was him?\" \"Yes.\" Persephone whispered, her hand touching the other in the same brushing motion as when she touched Sparky's.[Chapter 5] This is not a update, more of a notice. All my OLD multi chapter stories will be rewritten. Mainly due to how they now make me cringe a little. ","Summary":" Sparky sat on the bench with the baseball team.

This chapter is hopefully shorter than the ones after it. The Right Place Chapter One Everything was incredibly comfortable for the Aristocats as they lived in the Bonfamille house with the madame but even though Thomas was treated to these comforts, he most enjoyed being with Duchess and the kittens who were becoming less and less kitten like every day. He had been with this family for about four months now and the children were each going their own ways. He admired how Duchess would always take note of their lessons and be able to guide them in artistic pursuits. He adored Duchess and she had told him that she would like to have a litter of his offspring but he hadn't given her that yet. He was a little nervous about the kittens that he was becoming a fatherly figure to. They must have had a father. \"Are you thinking of something, Thomas, dear?\" Duchess asked and Thomas blinked in surprise before feeling Duchess rub herself against his body with a loving purr. \"The kittens are growing older, aren't they?\" Thomas asked as it looked as if Toulouse and Berlioz were play fighting with Marie directing her attention elsewhere. \"I was thinking of -\" \"Yes,\" Duchess sighed, \"It would be nice to have some babies that are ours .\" \"Ours,\" Thomas choked before they heard a window open and he turned away, \"Uh, I have to go check that out,\" he said and Duchess shook her head. \"Don't be silly, the Madame is just having some company round, that's all the noises are,\" she tried to tell him and Thomas nodded to her. \"You really are just like the children sometimes, Thomas, adventurous and playful with quite an imagination,\" she said affectionately. Thomas hopped off the sofa and went to where the noise had come from. He was surprised to see a calico male cat standing in the middle of the floor. His fur was neatly groomed and his nail beds seemed to be taken care of by some expensive French salon. He definitely did seem to be someone regarded as high class which made Thomas feel a little badly about himself. \"Hi, who are you?\" he asked with a tilt of his head as he looked at the three different fur patterns and how each one looked like one of the kittens. Was this? \"I am looking for Duchess,\" the cat told him and Thomas stared at him. \"I am her husband, just returned home. I'm here to see our kittens because I've just returned to Paris. I have been separated from them too long.\" \"And I'll bet that you'll be separated from them again,\" Thomas said. \"I'm with Duchess now,\" he said before hearing someone enter the room and he heard Duchess gasp as she took in the two of them. \"Duke?\" she asked as she looked at the calico and Thomas took a step back in shock. He turned to Duchess, no, she wouldn't go back with this guy, would she?[Chapter 2] Chapter Two Thomas sized up his rival. Duke and Duchess, it was like a set of names that was tailor made for each other, one of those high class couples that you would hear people praise. The cat did seem to be high profile and Thomas was a traveler, someone who had made his own life and a regular alley cat that had somehow found his way into these riches. \"So, you appear to be slumming it,\" Duke commented as he gave Thomas a cold look as if he were some cat found eating out of the trash can. \"I doubt that he's a purebred. You can't honestly be attracted to him.\" Duchess pushed her head against Thomas's and wrapped her tail around his lovingly. \"I'm sorry, Duke. Thomas has given me what I want. He's got a great character and he's a hard worker. He adores the children as well, treats them as his own.\" Duchess nuzzled Thomas and the ginger cat felt a little more stable because of this action. \"You know you are more worthy,\" he told her and Duchess hesitated, she shook her head. \"The status in your cla-\" \"It's not the status in class that matters,\" Thomas finally argued. He looked in the direction to where the kittens were. \"You left your family. You never should leave your family,\" he argued and then looked between them. \"And you shouldn't have anything between mixed breeding or otherwise you are insulting your own children.\" \"Left my family?\" Duke laughed, \"I was moved by my owner. I'm not some trash cat like you,\" he said and Thomas felt his anger boiling up. He looked to Duchess who was about to argue but shook his head. \"I'm not going to stand in the way of your reunion,\" he said and Duchess looked at him quickly. She didn't understand how he could be acting like this but Thomas jumped onto the window ledge and took a last look at his mate before jumping out and Duchess ran over. \"Thomas,\" she tried to call to him. \"Duke means nothing to me. You're the one that matters,\" she saw him run and turned to Duke. \"You should go see the kittens. Thomas is right. You did leave us and that wasn't your fault but I moved on from you. I fell in love with someone who is incredibly worthy of me,\" she said before sighing and led Duke to where the kittens were. … …. Thomas had absolutely no idea as to where he had run, he hadn't been thinking and usually he would know enough about the landmarks that he didn't have to worry about getting lost. He knew everywhere and everyone. He sighed as he tried to bow his head and curl up by the side. He shivered in the cold before trying to make sense of the different colors of the buildings. Maybe this was a place where humans gathered to shop and buy things. That meant that he had to be aware and keep his senses sharp. Who knew how those humans would react seeing a stray cat. Was that what he was now? A stray who had been tossed aside by the home and family that he had believed that he had found. Would Duke now take his place? Thomas sulked as he felt his tail bat the pavement. Duke probably deserved that high fancy lifestyle where Thomas had always worried a little that he was an imposter and would be found out. He could smell something, a strange aroma that made him hungry but it didn't smell of any food that he'd ever had. He licked his lips as he tried to think about what it was. He didn't realize that he was passing by different colored lights that didn't look normal. Humans decorated their buildings in strange ways anyway. He finally found the scent and then froze. There were dogs in the building, dogs were unpredictable and he could count four. Escape was probably the best for right now. However, before he could leave, a man came over to him and the dogs looked at him, watching him closely. \"It's a cat this time,\" he said and Thomas froze as the man grabbed him and picked him up. \"I was hoping for another dog but a cat will do fine.\" Thomas felt that he couldn't fight back against this man, something was stopping him and paralyzing his body and it didn't feel safe but then anything that led him to feel that he couldn't move wasn't safe. He tried to meow but as the man touched his throat he felt that he couldn't meow any longer and the man moved him over to the fireplace. At least there was warmth there. He wouldn't be burned alive, right? He felt his body get placed on the ground and the man gently stroked him. He put his hands over Thomas's forehead and the cat started to feel woozy. He fell down onto his paws in front of the fire and then felt his face start to itch. He felt himself growing, maybe to the size of a tiger. Were they turning him into a wild cat? He had to fight against this. He reached out a paw and his eyes widened as he realized that it wasn't a leg with a paw anymore, it was a human arm with a hand on the edge of it. His heart quickened but he felt that he couldn't get up. The next few moments were of agony and finally he lost himself to sleep. … … \"Here,\" Thomas heard as he woke up and saw the man before him holding out a human shirt and pants and Thomas stared at him confused. Why was he being given these items? \"Put these on,\" he told him and Thomas reached out to take the items with his mouth but his face felt different. \"Use your hands,\" he told him and as Thomas reached out he could see the human hand and he tried to stand on all fours but he could only sit up. His body felt different, it felt worse than he had ever felt before and he looked at his back paws. These were human legs, human feet. What had happened to him? \"Put these on,\" the man told him and Thomas took a deep breath in before taking the clothes, putting them on the way he had seen humans wearing them. \"I call this a balance of the animal species,\" he smiled before directing his attention to the dogs. \"Those used to be men who would experiment on other animals but their minds have been wiped,\" he told Thomas. \"I'd be happy to wipe your mind.\" \"No,\" Thomas whispered, his face felt different especially as he spoke. \"It's fine. I'm okay.\" \"You seem scared, that will change eventually,\" the man said and led Thomas to a mirror once he was changed. He felt a little dizzy as he stood on his two back legs. He froze, his eyes widening as he saw that he was one of those humans. He seemed to be good looking but that didn't matter, good looking humans were only good looking at a fraction of a cat. \"I have to get home, I have to get to my family,\" he panicked and the man raised an eyebrow. \"You should have brought them. I doubt that they'll recognize you,\" he said and Thomas nodded quickly. He took the shoes that he was offered and looked around. \"You'll change me back, right, right?\" he asked and the man laughed. \"Now why would I waste my skills and do a silly thing like that. If your family matter so much to you, bring them here. I'll make sure that you're well cared for,\" he said and Thomas's stomach lurched. Duchess was far more likely to choose Duke, the cat, over him in this freakish form. He had lost her. She would never be content with a human. End of Chapter Two Thank you for reading[Chapter 3] Chapter Three Human? He was one of those no-good humans, those cat enslavers? Thomas tried to take deep breaths and come to terms with what had happened to him that night but as he let his body rest against the wall and the deep breaths cause his chest to rise and fall, he realized that as crazy as the night had been, it had left him with a very unsettled feelings and a dangerous new life. He was a human whereas the love of his life was a gorgeous white cat. People and animals went together as well as ducks and horses. There was still Duke to contend with as well. He had to forget about that problem for right now. Duke was a cat and he needed to show that he wasn't a threat. He took a few deep breaths in before looking at himself in a window reflection. It was horrific to see the person moving in unison with him but this was what he had to work with right now. \"Calm down, calm down, you're going to be okay, it's going to be okay,\" Thomas attempted to tell himself although he was extremely scared about this whole thing. It was torture and it was even worse that nobody would believe him. Duke would use his not being there to replace him with the new family. He had done his best for Duchess and for the kittens as well. He couldn't let someone else take their place. He looked around before hearing the sound of music and realized where he was. This was familiar ground for him, territory in which he had once tried to claim a place. This was the place where scat cat hung out so it was a safe environment. With a deep breath in, Thomas followed the music and then put a hand to the building. Everything looked so much bigger through the eyes of a cat and now he was about four or five times the height of a cat…or was he bigger. He took a deep breath in before finding the way in that he always used. He looked at the hole, it was a little small for someone of his size but he wanted to check out the music. These were his best friends, extremely important felines in his life. They would recognize him and help him, right? Thomas looked to an abandoned gate and went in, he went up the steps to where the music was coming from and smiled. It was good to hear it again, calming. If he was with these cats then he could do anything. He put a hand to the wall and let his back rest there. He could hear meowing from inside and he froze. His eyes widened as he realized that he couldn't even make out the words that the meows were making. He could make out the tone but it was as if he had forgotten his natural language. He felt a pain in his heart as he realized that fact. As he stood there, he opened the door and caught the other cats staring at him before some hid under the instruments. He stayed very calmly as they watched one another. He knew to them that he was considered a human, someone who they would either fight or run from but these cats were more of a second family to him than any others he had encountered – his first family was with Duchess. \"Hi,\" he said as he knelt down, moving very slowly as to not scare any of them. The world looked so different through the eyes of a human. His friends looked so different when they were looked at through the eyes of a human. He hadn't wanted to hurt them. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered as he looked down. \"I don't know what happened to me. I really do apologize to you guys, you should know that I never wanted any of this to happen.\" Thomas stayed that way for a while and closed his eyes feeling completely helpless. He could hear movements from the cats and hoped he wasn't scaring his friends any more than usual. He felt one of the cats move towards him and sniff his hand and his arm before looking at him with great confusion. He opened his eyes and saw Scat Cat there with a little distrust in his eyes. He mewed at him before putting his paws on Thomas's shoulders and sniffed him a little bit, staring into his eyes. He tilted his head to the side as if figuring something out. \"I don't even know what happened,\" Thomas said and the other cats started to get closer to him as Scat Cat meowed that it was okay. \"I was led somewhere and there were dogs and they turned me into this,\" he gestured and Scat Cat nodded along. Thomas laughed. \"Cats are always so much smarter than humans,\" he told him and then heard Scat Cat meow in a way that sounded like his name. \"You guys can't really blame me. I'm terrified by this, I never meant to be made human. Why would I? I've got Duchess and the kittens to think about,\" he said looking as if he was giving up but Scat Cat came closer to him and rubbed his cheek against Thomas's chest whilst purring. Maybe he could find some help from his friends. Afterall, all that Thomas wanted was really to be a cat. ….. ….. \"Oh, Thomas\" Duchess said as she sat by the window looking up at the moon and the stars. She had spent many a night looking out upon the world with Thomas sitting right beside her. Maybe she was supposed to fall for somebody like Duke but Duke was too self-invested, at least Thomas was kind and giving and adventurous. She looked down. \"I do hope nothing has happened to you.\" \"He's a street cat,\" Duke laughed as he tried to nuzzle up to Duchess but she pulled away. 'He doesn't belong cooped up in a house, he's a roamer, travels from place to place, don't tell me that I noticed that before you did.\" \"Cats change, Duke\" Duchess told him as she jumped down from where she had been staring out at the street below her. \"I know that Thomas has and I know that I have as well. You broke my heart when you left me with the kittens to protect all by myself,\" she told him. She sighed slightly. \"It's nice to see you again but things can't be the way that they were before. Thomas is waiting for me.\" \"How can he be waiting for you when you don't have a clue where he is,\" Duke said before rolling his eyes. \"And how can you blame me for leaving, it was my human who left. I didn't leave. Why would I want to leave my kittens?\" he asked and Duchess sighed. \"I am glad that you have come back to see them but I've moved on. I choose Thomas and I'll choose him again and again no matter how many times that you ask me. I do wonder where he is and I hope that he's doing okay. He can take care of himself but I worry,\" Duchess admitted. Duke sighed, \"Did you ever worry about me?\" he asked her and Duchess turned back to him. \"Of course but that was a long time ago,\" she said before sighing, \"I will always be happy to see you, Duke, even if I no longer love you. I do not need to be in love with you to have a good friendship but Thomas is the one in my heart and it's him that I choose.\" \"Then I hope he proves you right with his abilities on those streets,\" Duke said and Duchess felt a little bit of a bite to those words. She shook her head. Male cats were hard to read no matter what pedigree they were of. End of Chapter Three Thank you for reading, reviews are appreciated ","Summary":" AN: So, this fic is going to be a little bit outside of the box because I was trying to think of so"},{"Movie":"Aristocats","Title":"Thomas O'Malley, Right Off the Cuff","Author":"AuroraRose1959","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11241479","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Marie, my little one, you are going to be as beautiful as your mother. Isn't she, Duchess?\" Smiling, Duchess looked up across the open carriage at her little girl. Marie was such a pretty child. She'd inherited her own pale blonde curls and blue eyes, though Duchess rather thought Marie would turn out far more beautiful than she was. The girl preened at the praise; she was rather spoiled by their benefactress, but Duchess could hardly be angry about that. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille unfailing kindness toward her and her three children still amazed her even after all these years. \"Careful, Toulouse!\" Madame's cry directed her attention toward her young son. Toulouse had begged to be allowed to sit in the driver's seat with Edgar, Madame's longsuffering butler, and was now practically standing in his seat. As he nearly toppled over into Edgar, Duchess reached out reflexively, but he simply plopped back down in his seat, looking like a model little gentleman aside from an impish grin. Madame chuckled. \"You're making it very difficult for Edgar!\" \"Toulouse, you must stay in your seat or you will have to come back here with us,\" Duchess said with calm firmness. \"Oh, he's no trouble at all, Mademoiselle.\" Edgar smiled down at the boy. \"Whoa, Frou-frou, whoa. Steady, girl.\" He reigned the horse in as they pulled up at the house. Berlioz, the youngest of the three triplets, bounded out of the carriage and over to the horse. As he petted her muzzle, he solemnly said, \"Thank you for the ride, Frou-frou.\" Duchess beamed at her son as she helped Marie down. His siblings often teased him for it, but Berlioz's sweet spirit truly warmed her heart. Of course, immediately the boy initiated the typical poking and pushing and sticking out of tongues he engaged in with Toulouse. Duchess sighed. If her children could go fifteen minutes without some kind of scuffle she considered it a relief. \"Ah, Madame, allow me to assist you.\" Edgar handed Madame down from the carriage. \"May, I take your parcel? It really is much too heavy for you.\" \"Now, tut-tut, Edgar, don't fuss over me. Duchess, children, come along inside.\" As they all walked leisurely up the walk to the immaculate mansion, Madame's tone became business-like. \"Now Edgar, I'm expecting my attorney, Georges Hautecourt-you remember him, of course.\" \"Of course, Madame. How could anyone forget him?\" Remembering Georges' last visit which ended with Edgar chasing him down the street to inform him that his pants had quite fallen down to his knees, Duchess exchanged glances with the butler and suppressed a laugh. She quickly grew somber again when she looked behind at her children and noticed two very fashionably dressed ladies on the other side of the street, staring at her with open disdain. Blushing, Duchess ushered her children inside, thankful that at age six they were still young enough to be oblivious to such things. oooooooooo Madame had wanted the children to begin their education as soon as possible, but Duchess had insisted that they be tutored at home rather than sent to a school. They spent their mornings with a tutor who taught them all of their basic academic lessons, and their evenings after dinner with Duchess supervising their various artistic endeavors. She and Madame had agreed that there was no need for private lessons for any of them in such subjects unless they showed a particular inclination toward them. So with the basic skills she had in sketching, and the more expert knowledge she had in music, Duchess worked with each of her three children on whatever artistic endeavors they wished each day. Berlioz had been practicing piano industriously for nearly a year now. He had always been drawn the instrument, telling his mother that he was going to be as good as her someday. Marie had tried out anything and everything for a little while, but nothing held her attention. Duchess had finally at least convinced her to practice singing, and the precocious girl complied once she realized the attentions she received from Madame by giving her little impromptu concerts. Toulouse had been as stubborn about Duchess's nightly lessons as he was about his academic lessons until about a month ago when, in a last desperate effort to find something he'd enjoy, Duchess had set up an easel and some paints for him. The boy had initially merely enjoyed making messes, but Duchess noticed with approval that he soon was making a focused effort to actually create likenesses of whatever struck his fancy. That evening, lessons were particularly lively. For the past week, Duchess had Berlioz working on an accompaniment piece to a song for Marie to sing, and that particular practice had resulted in many a sour note and a few fights-Marie insisted that \"ladies do not start fights, but they can finish them,\" and Duchess was secretly inclined to agree with her. Toulouse had showed her the painting he'd been keeping hidden from her for several days, and it turned out to be a rather unflattering portrait of Edgar. Duchess had had so much fun with the three of them that she often nearly forgot she was supposed to be keeping order, training her children to be proper ladies and gentlemen. As their evening lessons drew to a close, Edgar entered the room with the tea tray. \"Good evening, Mademoiselle, children.\" He set the tray down at the small table in the corner of the room. \"Earl grey tea tonight-your favorite, Mademoiselle.\" \"Oh, how thoughtful! Thank you, Edgar.\" Duchess sat and took a long sip of her tea, her children following her example. \"Sleep well-I mean, drink. Drink well, of course.\" Edgar gave a slight bow before retreating out into the hallway. Concerned by his strange behavior, Duchess watched him go, taking another quiet sip of her tea and pretending she didn't notice her children gulping at theirs. She'd corrected them enough for one day. Sometimes she wanted to just allow them to be- oooooooooo Duchess woke up in the dead of night by the side of a small stream, utterly alone.[Chapter 2] \"Berlioz? Toulouse, Marie, where are you?\" \"Here I am, Mama,\" came Marie's plaintive voice from about twenty feet away. Relief flooded through Duchess as her eyes adjusted to the darkness and she saw her daughter slowly sit up and rub her eyes. She rushed over to her and scooped the child up into her arms. \"Marie, darling, are you all right?\" The little girl looked confused for a moment before replying, \"I guess I had a nightmare and fell out of bed.\" Suddenly, they heard frightened cries of \"Mama! Mama!\" coming from the stream. Letting Marie down, Duchess hurried toward the sound, frantic eyes searching for her son. \"Berlioz! Berlioz, I'm right here! Don't worry, everything is going to be all right!\" \"I'm coming, Mama.\" Berlioz rose up from the grasses bordering the stream several feet away from her. \"I\"m c-cold and I'm wet.\" Duchess held her son in a tight embrace before leading him by the hand over to where Marie stood. \"Now, children, darlings, just stay here while I go and look for Toulouse.\" Marie yelled out, \"Toulouse!\" as Duchess scanned the area for her oldest. Berlioz joined her, and the two siblings called out their brother's name. \"Hey, what's all the yelling about?\" \"Oh, thank goodness,\" Duchess breathed. She went over to a small bridge, where the voice had come from, and quickly noticed Toulouse's shockingly orange hair, contrasting sharply with the stones of the bridge. As she knelt down beside him, he told her thoughtfully, \"I was having a funny dream. Edgar was in it, and we were all riding and bouncing along-\" He seemed to notice his surroundings for the first time. \"Oh, it wasn't a dream. Edgar brought us out here.\" Duchess barely had time to register Toulouse's words when a loud crash of thunder had all three children clinging to her long skirts. Seeing no other shelter, she quickly ushered them under the bridge. It was a bit cramped, but they all fit, and no sooner had they all settled themselves than rain starting pouring all around them. Duchess arranged herself to block her children from the worst of it. \"What's going to happen to us?\" For a moment, Duchess's fears nearly overcame her. What was going to happen? She had no idea where they were or how they got there. All she knew was that she and her children had been drugged, and she couldn't let herself think about that or she might start remembering why she knew what it felt like to have been drugged. She took a deep breath. If she'd been by herself, she might have allowed herself to break down, but she didn't have that luxury. She had three children who needed her to appear calm so that they wouldn't be too afraid. She swallowed hard before forcing a smile. \"Well, darlings, as long as this storm holds out, we're going to stay right here. Now you go to sleep, and then in the morning we'll head home.\" How they were to get home, she had no idea. The children, satisfied that there was nothing to worry about for the time being, soon fell asleep, but Duchess remained anxiously awake until just before dawn. ooooo Thomas O'Malley wandered the country lane, his shirt sleeves rolled up and his jacket tossed carelessly over his shoulder. With no particular direction in mind, he lazily ambled along, singing snatches of pub songs. He'd spent the past two days in some quaint little French town, doing various odd jobs for various people, and they'd paid him far better than he'd expected. If he was careful, he could make the money last a month, maybe a month and a half. So he was in no particular hurry to reach the next town. As he neared a small bridge that arched over a stream, he saw a young woman kneeling at the water's edge, sipping water from her cupped hands. Thomas watched, mesmerized, as she unpinned her hair and shook out pale curls so long that they brushed her hips. After running her fingers through it, she deftly coiled her hair back up and was pinning it back in place when some sound or instinct caused her to turn toward Thomas. Startled, she shot up to her feet, her hair tumbling to her waist again. \"Sorry, miss!\" Thomas said amicably. \"Didn't mean to scare you.\" \"Oh, that's - that's quite all right.\" She blushed but quickly collected herself. \"You merely startled me.\" Thomas stepped off the road and walked toward her, appreciating that the closer he got to her, the more he noticed how beautiful she was. \"Well, I do apologize all the same. My name is Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley, and I am at your service!\" he declared with a flourish of his cap. Just as he'd intended, the young woman seemed intrigued. \"Your name seems to cover all Europe,\" she observed. \"I am the only man of my kind,\" he grinned. \"And what might your name be?\" She arched a brow but answered, \"Duchess.\" \"Duchess - beautiful.\" He took a step closer, gazing deeply into her blue eyes with his best smolder. \"And those eyes…Why, your eyes are like sapphires, sparkling so bright, they make the morning radiant -\" what rhymed with bright? - \"and light,\" he finished. Duchess's mouth twitched at the corners, suppressing a smile. \"Very poetic. But not quite Shakespeare.\" As if she hadn't loved it! \"Of course it's not Shakespeare. That's pure O'Malley, right off the cuff.\" He smiled down at her. \"I got a million of them.\" \"No more, please,\" Duchess said firmly. \"I really am in a great deal of trouble and I haven't the time for this.\" She went back to work pinning up her hair. \"Trouble?\" Thomas furrowed his brow in a show of concern. He was certain by her calm demeanor there was no real trouble, but it couldn't hurt to act sympathetic. \"Why, I could never leave a beautiful lady such as you in distress. What's the problem?\" Glancing at him as if to gauge his reaction, she replied after a slight hesitation, \"Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris. But I am afraid I'm not sure where I am. So if you would be so kind as to show me the way?\" Suddenly, Thomas knew where he was headed after all. \" Show you the way? Perish the thought! We shall fly to Paris together on a magic carpet, side by side!\" He held out his hand to her, waiting expectantly for her to take it. \"Just the two of us.\" A small voice from behind him said, \"Oh, that would be wonderful!\" He whirled around to see a small girl, looking up at him excitedly. He looked back at Duchess, thoroughly confused. Then back at the girl. It was impossible not to see the resemblance. Looking back at Duchess, he questioned, \"Three?\" When he looked back at girl, she no longer stood alone. Two small boys stood at her side, all looking up at him eagerly.\"Four? Five?!\"[Chapter 3] \"Yes, Monsieur O'Malley, these are my children.\" Duchess was accustomed to shocked stares when people realized that she had three children, but usually it was because she was so young, with no wedding band adorning her left hand. She suspected, though, that this O'Malley character's reaction had more to do with her having children at all. The dramatic difference between the way he looked at her now and the way he had flirtatiously gazed into her eyes mere moments ago was almost comical. Almost. \"Oh.\" He faltered for just a moment. \"How sweet.\" \"Do you really have a magic carpet?\" Toulouse asked skeptically. \"And are we really going to ride it?\" Marie practically squealed. Duchess sighed. This man had failed to sweep her off her feet but had inadvertently swept up the children in his ridiculousness. And now she would have to be the one to fix this mess. \"Marie -\" \"Mama, do I have sparkling sapphire eyes, too?\" Marie looked at her hopefully. O'Malley rubbed at the back of his neck. \"Oooh, did I say that?\" \"Yes. Right off your cuff.\" Duchess had meant to make that sound more biting, but she heard an undercurrent of sadness creep into her tone and could only hope he hadn't noticed it. The last thing she wanted was for this philanderer to think she was disappointed about any of this. \"And you said we were going to ride on your magic carpet,\" Toulouse reminded him. \"Well, uh, now - you see, what I meant was, uh -\" \"No poetry to cover this situation, Monsieur O'Malley?\" At Duchess' remark, he at least had the decency to look somewhat embarrassed. But he immediately shook that off and said, \"Well, see, what I had in mind was something a little more private, like, uh -\" \"A magic carpet built for two?\" Duchess finished. \"I wouldn't take up much room,\" Marie said plaintively. Duchess smiled humorlessly at her daughter's innocent observation. But this man was clearly not going to help her and she was tired of him wasting her time. \"I understand perfectly, Monsieur O'Malley.\" Sweeping past him, she motioned for her children to follow her. \"Come along, darlings.\" They were nearly at the road when Duchess noticed Toulouse was not with her. She looked back to see him talking indistinctly to O'Malley. He had his little fists up and was pretending to punch at the man, and O'Malley was laughing and showing him to hold his fists higher. Duchess would have smiled were she not so upset with the man. \"Toulouse,\" she called out. \"Come along, dear.\" Her son's shoulders drooped but he obediently ran to her. O'Malley called out after him, \"See you around, kid!\" As if he had any intention of ever seeing them again. Duchess bit her tongue in irritation and continued to walk toward the road. She faltered when she actually reached it, not wanting to go in the wrong direction and have to deal with O'Malley's snide comments. But just before she had to make a decision, her thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice. \"Hey! Hey, hold up there!\" She and the children turned to see O'Malley jogging toward them. When he reached them, she arched an eyebrow and asked tartly, \"Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?\" He glanced at her warily but turned his attention to the children and smiled. \"Now look, kids. If I said magic carpet, magic carpet it's gonna be.\" \"Oh boy!\" Toulouse was practically jumping up and down. \"We're gonna fly after all!\" Duchess's eyebrow shot up even higher. \"Another flight into fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?\" He looked at her guiltily, but squared his shoulders and said, \"No. But I am gonna walk with you until I can get you a ride to Paris.\" He stepped onto the road and motioned toward the left. \"Come on. Paris is this way.\" ooooo As much as Duchess had tried to hide it, Thomas could see how relieved she was when he'd announced he was accompanying them. He'd felt awful when he realized what a scoundrel he was, just letting a girl like that off on her own, not even knowing where she was going. So what if she had kids? Sure, his hopes of spending a romantic night with a beautiful woman just went out the window. But he wasn't heartless. As they walked along the road, the kids chattering about a frog they saw or fighting who got to lead the way at the front of the group, Thomas couldn't help but notice how pensive Duchess was. She kept an eye on her kids, scolding them gently if made too much mischief, but otherwise she seemed entirely lost in thought. \"So,\" he began, careful to keep as casual an air as possible, \"What's a girl like you doing way out here?\" Duchess cast a worried glance at her children before replying softly, \"I'm not sure.\" Taken aback, Thomas was about to question further when she continued, \"The last thing any of us remember is sitting together at home. In Paris . . . Wait, what day is it?\" she asked sharply. \"Tuesday. The sixteenth.\" Thomas watched her face carefully as she thought. \"It was just last night, then,\" she mused. His alarm growing, Thomas nonetheless kept up his usual mask of indifference. Whatever the hell was going on here, Duchess was obviously determined to keep the kids from realizing there was anything to worry about, and he would follow her lead. He made sure the three were still preoccupied with Follow-the-Leader. \"Sounds like you came here by car,\" he mentioned lightly. \"We're a good sixty miles from Paris.\" Duchess' eyes widened, but before she could say anything, Thomas held a hand up to motion her to quiet. There was a rumbling sound coming from behind them. He grinned. \"Speaking of cars . . .\" ","Summary":" \"Marie, my little one, you are going to be as beautiful as your mother.

I mean it baby, I only just saw the first movie a couple of days ago but found myself laughing my ass off at just about everything! Anyway, the only thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that Vanessa turned out to be a fembot! (I mean come on! There chemistry was so perfectly groovy baby!) So anyway, I came up with what I hope will be this brilliant idea about continuing the story after part three, but having Vanessa be a human and be there all along, so yeah I hope you enjoy it! Vanessa looked down at the pregnancy test. She couldn't believe it! It tested positive! The only thing to do now was to tell her husband Austin about it, and that was perfect since tonight he was taking her out for their anniversary dinner. As soon as she opened the door Mystery the family beagle started rushing towards her wagging his tail and trying to jump on top of her. She had just assumed that it was because he was hungry until he started humping her leg. \"Ah! Oh my God that is so disgusting! I thought Austin was supposed to get you fixed!\" she yelled when suddenly Doug ran inside the room and grabbed ahold of his collar and pulled him away from her. \"Thank you.\" She told him. \"You're welcome Mrs. Powers, pretty horny puppy that you got there.\" He said. \"Yep, he's Austin's alright.\" She agreed when Doug realized what she was holding inside her hand. \"Isn't that one of those pregnancy test things?\" he questioned as he raised his pinkie up to his lower lip. \"Yep, and it tested positive.\" She answered with a nod. \"Holy shit! You've really got a bun in the oven!? Wait until I tell mini me, he always wanted to be an uncle!\" he exclaimed. \"Please for the love of God keep your voice down! Austin doesn't know yet and I want to tell him at dinner.\" She snapped inside a whisper while leaning her head in towards his so that he would be able to hear her. \"Tell me what baby?\" Austin asked as he strutted inside the room as Vanessa quickly gasped and hid her results behind her back. \"That_ that_ that I thought you were going to get that animal of yours fixed!\" she exclaimed. \"Listen baby, his name might be Mystery but that doesn't mean that I don't want him to know what that thing hanging there below him is used for.\" He said as Vanessa rolled her eyes at him before she left the room. \"Wait Vanessa! I just don't want to rob him of his manhood that's all!\" he cried before he looked down at his dog. \"Let me guess you tried to hump her leg again didn't you you naughty animal?\" he questioned with a wag of his finger down at him as Mystery just sat down and looked up at him with a whimper and slightly cocking his head over to the side. \"Listen Dougie, me and my wife are going out so could you please take care of feeding him?\" Austin asked. \"Alright sure you sly dog you!\" his brother exclaimed with a slap on the back just as Austin was about to turn around and walk away. Then he suddenly stopped and turned around to face him. \"What in the world are you talking about?\" he asked him. \"The fact that you are going to be a da_da_dad_daddy O'.\" Doug said stuttering over his own words before he grinned and clicked his tongue upon his teeth while using his thumbs and pointer fingers like guns and pointing them at him. \"Oh I see, groovy baby!\" he cried before bumping his fists together with his and with a chuckle he turned around and left the room. \"I don't have a clue what just happened.\" He said to himself once Doug was out of earshot. … .. \"Austin, I have something to tell you.\" Vanessa began after she took a sip of her drink. \"Well go ahead and tell me baby, I'm all ears.\" Austin said with a grin as he took a sip of his own drink. \"I'm pregnant.\" She said as he spat it back out again. \"What!?\" he cried. \"Austin, you're going to be a father.\" She told him as she flashed him a warm smile. \"No freakin way!\" he yelled. \"Wait a tick, I meant no freak,.. no freakin way.\" He said as his wife noticed that he seemed fairly confused. \"Vanessa, this is a fanfiction, and it's rated T why can't I say the word?\" he asked her. \"Because the author of this story thought it would be rather funny to bleep the words out like they do in the actual movies. \"Oh.\" He began simply before he quickly leapt to his feet. \"Well look out world, I'm getting ready to be a daddy!\" he shouted as he started dancing out of the restaurant with the funky music in the background playing as a bunch of women started following him and copying his moves. Later that night Vanessa arrived back at home with a deep and heavy sad sigh. \"Vanessa, you're back early.\" Doug said as he got up from the couch along with mini me before they turned to look at her. \"What's wrong?\" Doug asked her as mini me looked at her sympathetically. \"I told Austin.\" She began. \"And once again he treated it like it was some big joke. I don't know why I ever let myself think that he could take things seriously for a change.\" She said before she turned away towards the bedroom just as Austin walked through the front door. \"What's wrong? Why are you guys looking at me like that?\" he asked noticing his brother's and nephew's icy cold glares inside his direction. \"Honestly brother,\" Doug began as he folded his arms. \"You have got to stop being such a swinger, it's ruining your marriage.\" He said. \"What are you talking about? I am a swinger, it's who I am.\" His brother answered. \"Yeah but you're about to become a father, and if you love Vanessa and want to keep her and your child then you should probably start thinking about giving that up. I mean I used to be evil, but when I found out that you and I were really brothers I gave it up, and things are really going well for me.\" He told him as Austin breathed a heavy sad sigh.

Enter Hollywood talent Scout, Scott Evil: No one could have worn his father's \"genes\" better. He was more vicious than Simon Cowell and Christina Aguilera put together in the same room. Dr. Evil, after siding with his brother, Austin Powers, left him his lair, where Scott carried out Dr. Evil's unfinished plans to take over the world- and kill…Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery… \"You know what I'm going to do for you?\" Scott said, petting Mr. Bigglesworth. \"Mister Mustafa, was it? And Goldmember?\" \"Yesh,\" Goldmember muttered quietly. \"Yesh.\" He was wearing shades, and gold underwear that said \"Justin.\" Mustafa had on a tutu. \"Please,\" Mustafa inquired. \"I would very much- l-like to know…what you think of my choreographed performance.\" He wore a look of great hope and anticipation on his face. \"Yeah, the reenactment of Justin Beiber from an awkward Arabian guy and some Swedish weirdo doesn't really do it for me,\" Scott said. \"But…I'm from Holland…\" Goldmember corrected. \"I know that's veird,\" he repeated, over and over again, moving his head from side to side. \"So- you're saying,\" Mustafa said slowly, \"You didn't like it?\" \"Listen,\" Scott began, \"You guys suck. You have no talent.\" \"Ouch, that hurts,\" Goldmember said. \"You guys are old. Nobody wants to see old people listen to young people music. I mean- what the hell is that? You can't sing, you sure as hell can't dance, and you look like a bunch of assholes. Number 2 could do a better job than both of you, and he's named after a turd.\" \"It's true,\" Number 2 said. \"I am.\" Scott made a hand gesture as if to say, \"See?\" While Mustafa and Goldmember nodded. \"But the turd doesn't fall far from the asshole,\" Mustafa quoted philosophically. Scott ignored him. \"Look- I'm not saying this because I care. You really suck. And what's with Justin on the back of your underwear? That's so…homo.\" \"He's the Justin of today, not the Timberlake of the 90's,\" Goldmember squeaked, defending himself. \"Who cares?\" Scott said. \"I hate Justin Beiber. I like death metal, understand? Death. Metal. Not this crap.\" Mustafa and Goldmember looked down, ashamed. \"But here's what I'm going to do for you,\" Scott said. \"I'm going to save myself from the horror I just witnessed…and you're going to save yourselves…from your miserable lives.\" The last part of the sentence striked an eerie resemblance to Dr. Evil, as Scott placed a pinky up to the corner of his mouth. \"Mother,\" he commanded. \" YES!\" Frau said, making everyone in the room jump. \"The button,\" he whispered. Frau looked confused. \"The button,\" Scott said again. \"The- the button,\" he repeated a little louder so Frau could hear him, glancing at Goldmember and Mustafa. \"What…what button?\" Mustafa asked, catching on to Scott's fleeting glance and looking to Goldmember for an answer, who shook his head. \"Oh, that button…\" Goldmember said wide-eyed, as Frau finally found it. Frau pushed it, and the metal flooring separated to reveal a tank of sharks with lasers attached to their heads. Goldmember and Mustafa were plunged into the water, heads bobbing up for air. \"A round of applause for these gentlemen,\" Scott said. \"Now, tell me- tell me. Who thought it sucked? Let's see a show of….hands?\" He pointed at the drowning Mustafa and Goldmember, whose hands were sticking out, just above the water. \"Mua-hahahaha!\" Scott laughed as they drowned. \"Mua-hahahaha!\" The rest of Scott's henchmen joined in, even Frau. \"Mu-hahahahahahaha! Mu-hahahahahahaha!\" \"I'm here for the party!\" A loud, Scottish voice rung out. \"Fat Bastard,\" Scott said, as if he couldn't fathom how his performance would top Goldmember's and Mustafa's. \"Yeah, but don't send your sharks on meh. I've got enough skin left tuh make 'em pyook.\" \"What is it you're here for?\" Scott said. \"The talent show!\" He said undoubtedly. \"Ya didn't think I'd pass up this chance, did ya? The media doesn't like fat people, and now that I'm skinny…\" \"No, dumbass, what can you do?\" Scott was more specific. \"Oh, aye!\" Fat Bastard said. \"I can fart rainbows of songs! They come at me when I'm on the shitter. It's the strangest thing. Last week it was the Statefarm jingle. Would ya a little sneak peak, a preview?\" His eyebrows raised in amusement and he smiled. He began to blow ass, and sure enough, it was as he'd said. Everyone groaned and made faces of disgust. \"And that's just the half of it,\" Fat Bastard said proudly. \"The smell really came into it's own.\" He took a whiff. \"Really- matured, you know?\" \"Number two, can you open a window?\" Scott asked. Mustafa was still drowning. \"Mom…Scott began, shaking his head. \"Just close the tank.\" They could still hear Mustafa's fists beating against the metal. Meanwhile, back at Austin's pad… Time: 10:30 pm Location: Austin's Pad, California \"Hello, you handsome dog, you!\" Austin Powers stood full-frontal nude in the mirror, grooming the hair on his chest with a fine-tooth comb. He barked savagely at his reflection, showing both his teeth and his approval of himself, and then chuckling. The room had a 60's look to it, with wild colors everywhere, floral decorations and lava lamps. There was a knock at the door. \"The door is open , baby, come on in,\" Austin said, pleased. Dr. Evil, hunched over, walked in awkwardly. \"Um, do you think you could…?\" \"Oh, don't be intimidated, man,\" Austin said to Dr. Evil. \"We're brothers! I'm sure you sword wields as much power as mine does.\" \"Riiiight…\" Dr. Evil said. \"It would be good if we didn't see each other naked- yeah. We're kind of in modern times, here. No organic food, no Burning Man, no colony of nudists…That sort of thing.\" Austin Powers threw on some clothes- black slacks and his usual blue blouse with white ruffles underneath. \"Yeah, about that nightclub, not gonna be able to make it.\" Dr. Evil said. \"Don't tell me you're chickening out on me?\" Austin looked at him in disbelief, and then reached for his silver male medallion. Dr. Evil shrugged, looking like a turtle in a shell. \"Well… I'm just starting to get used to normal society. I don't think an evil doctor would be welcome in a night club.\" \"You've got to be kidding me, baby! Nightclubs are for sinners, saints posing as sinners, cynics, critics, Catholics, swingers, sluts and tom-peepers, sleepers, and scads of serious thrill-seekers.\" He threw his head from side to side after each person of description, and after, was out of breath. \"Evil never sleeps there!\" \"I don't know,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Listen, baby, if you're worried about being handsome- Austin said as he fixed his collar in the mirror- you don't have to.\" \"Well, I always thought my nose was big, you know, just…\" and Dr. Evil put his fingers up to indicate \"just a little.\" \"No, man! Look at your shiny, bald head. It's brilliant, baby!\" Austin gave Dr. Evil's head a noogie and kissed the top of it. Dr. Evil pursed his lips and looked in his peripheral vision at Austin. \"You really think so?\" \"Plenty of chicks dig those bald men who shave their heads because of a mid-life crisis and invest in motorcycles. And yours is natural! Be proud, baby, be very proud!\" \"I guess you're right,\" Dr. Evil clapped his hands together giddily and smiled. \"Damn right, I am!\" Austin Powers said with a wink. \"A little leather and you have a little mojo. Don't forget your mojo, baby. That's important.\" \"How do I look?\" Dr. Evil had on his grey suit, and a black leather vest. He held a pinky questioningly to the corner of his mouth. He looked like Dr. Evil in a grey suit with a black leather vest. \"Smashing, baby!\" Austin exclaimed. Just then, a familiar tone played on Austin's laptop. It was Bazzle. \"Hello, Austin!\" He said in his Brittish accent. \"Ehem. Dr. Evil.\" Dr. Evil sat awkwardly on the edge of Austin's bed, shifting his eyes from side to side with his hands in his lap, his lips pursed. \"I'm sure this is weird, since I'm usually your subject of conversation, yeah,\" Dr. Evil admitted. \"Oh, spit it out, Bazzle!\" Austin shouted in annoyance. Bazzle cleared his throat again and replied, \"Right. I've received intelligence that Scott Evil's whereabouts have been sighted at the up-and-coming Nighthawk Club in downtown Los Angeles. We need you to…wait…is Dr. Evil ok with this?\" Bazzle asked uncertainly. Austin's head darted toward Dr. Evil. \"Yes, yes, I'm fine,\" Dr. Evil muttered, putting a hand up. \"I'm used to betraying my own blood-line.\" Austin darted his head back toward Bazzle on the computer screen, and he continued. \"Austin, we need you to apprehend Scott's henchmen. We're not up to speed on what he's planning, but we do know it's urgent.\" \"I'm your man, Bazzle.\" \"Oh, and Austin- you're going to need Mini-Me. This club stands a secret to most of Los Angeles. There's a bouncer behind a thick door who needs to know the password. Mini-Me will have to crawl through a hole in the side of a wall and open the door for you to gain entry. How you take out the bouncer is up to you.\" \"I'm on it,\" Austin assured him. \"Right. To my shag-mobile!\" Mini-Me had on some funky shades, a top hat, a suit and a jeweled cane. \"You look positively dapper, you gorgeous, wicked munchkin of the west!\" Austin laughed. He picked up Mini-Me by the head, and kissed him on both cheeks while his tiny legs kicked about. They'd parallel-parked Austin's car and stood at the neon entrance of the Nighthawk. Mini-Me smiled. \"You know what you have to do, right?\" Austin Powers asked him. Mini-Me nodded and ducked down, proceeding to go into the tiny hole, where the bouncer stood on the other side of the alley. He got stuck halfway through. Austin took his shoe and lurched it at Mini-Me. \"What are you doing?\" Dr. Evil asked him. \" Little- bugger's- got- to go- through!\" Austin said, continuing to shove Mini-Me. \"Daddy loves you,\" Dr. Evil called down to Mini-Me, a hand cupped to his mouth so that he could hear. \"Eeeeeeee!\" Mini-Me cried. \"Eeeeeeeeeeeee!\" \"It's a good thing he's doing,\" Dr. Evil convinced himself aloud, while Austin continued to boot him. He flailed around on the other side, arms thrashing up and down. \"I'll go distract the bouncer. Excuse me,\" he called out. \"I don't know if you've noticed, perhaps, but this young lady has been standing in line for an hour.\" He pointed to the nearest person, who happened to be a tall man with a handle-bar mustache. \"Oh,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Oops….\" Austin finally managed to get Mini-Me into the hole in the wall, when suddenly, Dr. Evil shouted. Austin rushed up to the entrance to see what was going on. \"And I'm a fricken evil genius. Did you honestly think your wits could match mine?\" The man with the mustache was bound and gagged. \"No, but my muscles can kick your ass,\" A larger man shouted. \"Have you any idea how moronic that sounds?\" Dr. Evil asked him. \"Honestly.\" \"Judo-chop!\" Austin Powers cried, and hit him in the nose. He ducked down and dodged a hit from the man just in time. The crowd gasped. \"Dr. Evil! Do something! We need to get inside, now!\" Dr. evil, looking around and not seeing how he possibly could be of any help, poked the bouncer in the eyes with his two fingers. \"Oooww!\" The bouncer cried, stumbling backward. Mini-Me flung the door open, and just as it was about to close, mooned the men waiting in line. He had bruise marks on both butt-cheeks. Austin made an \"ouch\" face, and after came the guilt and realization that it was because of his own doing. Austin, Dr. Evil, and Mini-Me slipped through the door to the Nighthawk.

I make no money off of this. It just makes me tingly and gleeful. I hope it does you as well. Warning: This story contains the spanking of a young adult, but don't worry, the brat had it coming. Still, if this is not your thing please don't read. Author's Note: This is a silly little fluff piece written for my friend Jenna [spankingfemfatale]. Reeling In Scott Evil The room was tense as all of Dr. Evil's minions watched as Austin Powers aimed his pistol at their leader's heart. \"Take your shot, Austin!\" Foxie called out, walking up beside Austin and striking a pose. Frau Farbisinna clutched her heart in fear for her lover. \"Everybody else, drop your guns cuz Foxie Cleopatra's in the house! Bam!\" \"Oh dear,\" Dr. Evil muttered as he slightly paced side to side, looking for an exit that wasn't there, pinky held up to his mouth. \"I've got you know, Dr. Evil,\" Austin smirked as he cocked the gun. \"You've threatened the world for the last time!\" \"Austin, what do you think you're doing?\" Austin's father Nigel said as he entered the room. \"Finishing this for good, Daddy.\" Austin tried to hold the gun steady, but couldn't keep his hand from shaking. Somehow, finally having his nemesis ready to die was quite unnerving. \"No Austin, I have to protect my son....both of them.\" All eyes in the room shot to Nigel in confusion. \"What are you talking about, Dad?\" said Austin in slight irritation. \"You're brothers, Austin. Your Mum died in a car explosion, I found you alive outside of the car. There was no sign of your brother, I thought he'd died too. I later learned a Belguim couple walking by had found and raised him. I'd of taken him back, but they turned him so daaaamn Evil,\" Nigel said with contempt as Dr. Evil shuddered happily at the remark, almost beaming proudly. \"....course, Belguim DOES share a border with the Dutch\" Nigel made sure to glare at Goldmember. \"Brothers?\" Dr. Evil said quietly, and Nigel nodded. \"Well, you know Mr. Powers, I'll have to wait for all the evidence to come in.....OH, DADDY!!\" he cried, hopping as he ran to hug his new found father with Austin quickly joining them, both sons hooting in fits of laughter. All three embraced in a family hug as Mini-me joined them. Strangely, the shock of learning they were brothers was absent in both Austin and Dr. Evil. Somehow, they always seemed to know deep down about their brotherly bond. Dr. Evil smiled and laughed, overjoyed at the warm embrace, at the fact that he had a brother and at being reunited with Mini-me. Scott watched from a distance, grinding his teeth in disgust until he could take no more. \"Oh come ON! First I'm not evil enough for you, and now you're gonna turn good?...now that I'm finally going evil?!\" Scott yelled. \"I hate you all! I hate you, and you, and you....\" he said, pointing at his father, Austin and Nigel. \"...and I especially hate YOU!\" He saved a special sneer for Mini-me. Mini-me of course threw his hands up in the air and shrugged his shoulders, forever mocking Scott playfully. \"Oh, but Scotty, we have a complete family now!\" Dr. Evil ventured. \"You'll pay. You'll all pay!\" Scott screamed, turning to run, Mini-me happily waving goodbye. Dr. Evil started after him, but just then Goldmember made his presence known. \"Not sho fasht, shmarty pants! You might not want to deshtroy zhe world now, but I shtillll DOOOOOOOO!\" Goldmember sang out as he stood next to the doomsday machine, and everyone stopped to stare. \"Operation Preperation H will go on ash planned. I'm going to flood de eeeeeaaaarth, ahh ha haaaaa!\" Foxie ran to Goldmember, quickly subduing him. \"I got this sugar, you go get your boy!\" Scott turned to run, flailing his legs and arms both effeminately and manically as he tried to make his escape. \"Scott? Scotty?? Come back here...\" he turned to the others, \"..I'd like to point out that no one else in my gene pool runs like a girl.\" Scott was nearly at the door when his mother, Frau Farbisinna, stepped in front of it and folded her arms. She fixed him with a firm glare, and Scott skidded to a halt, not sure what to do next. With Scott frozen, scheming his next move, Dr. Evil snuck up behind him and grabbed him by the arm. \"There we go, Scotty, a good family hug will work it all out,\" he said, spinning him around to face his grandpa and uncle with a pat on his shoulder, \"evil won't seem so important then.\" Scott stomped his dad's foot and wrenched himself free. Acting on instinct, Scott reached down and grabbed a gun dropped by one of his dad's henchmen, brandishing it randomly around the room as Dr. Evil hopped around the room, cursing. \"Ha! Look who's 'Quasi-Evil' now! This plan is going down, and I'm taking the money. I'll start my own evil empire,\" he said before breaking into his evil laugh, fixing the gun on his dad's chest. Dr. Evil and Austin shared a look before Dr. Evil approached his son, hands raised in surrender. \"Now now, Scott, we wouldn't want to hurt Daddy, would we?\" \"Judo CHOP!\" Austin yelled as he knocked Scott to the ground. Before Scott could recover, his father had him firmly by the ear. \"You know, Scotty, Daddy doesn't like getting his foot stomped or having a gun pointed at him,\" he said as he led his son to his chair while Scott flailed and whimpered. \"I think someone is long overdue for a spanking.\" \"Oh, spaaanky spaaaanky!\" Austin laughed before meowing, causing the room to break out in bursts of laughter. \"No, you can't! I'm not a child anymore! Mom, make him stop!\" Scott looked at his mom the best he could while being pulled over his dad's lap, wrestling to get away, but Frau Farbissina merely smiled and nodded her approval to Dr. Evil as he secured their son in place over his knees. The spanking was started immediately, and Scott wasted no time in yelping and kicking indignantly at the firm swats landing on his upturned little bottom. \"Aw, little naughty boy getting shpanked by his fasshar, ha ha ha.\" Goldmember bounced from foot to foot in delight, laughing as Foxie kept him otherwise subdued. \"I'll get you, you Dutch FREAK!\" Scott bellowed, twitching at each spank now, legs still kicking. \"I'll get all of you for this!\" \"Dr. Evil, can I paint his yoohoo gold? I don't think he'sh going to turn good!\" \"No, you Dutch bastard, he's my son! How about some SHHH time! Need a little SHHH!\" \"What about his bottom, then? Not quite my calling card, but it'll dooooo.\" Goldmember sang out. \"Unless you want to be next, I suggest you leave my grandson alone!\" Nigel fixed Goldmember with a glare as he made a point of putting his hands on his belt. Goldmember noticably shrunk at the warning, eyeing Nigel suspiciously and keeping quiet. \"I expect better of you, Scotty, especially since we so recently became close.\" Dr. Evil said as he focused on his son's sit spots, making Scott's yelps change into cries of pain. \"You have no right! OW! You were never here for me! OW! You always put me down! OOWW! You Don't Care! OOOWW!\" Scott yelled, grabbing his dad's leg, trying to squirm away. \"I Do care, Scotty. Otherwise I would have let you go. I know I haven't been the best dad, but I'm trying.\" Scott's only response was to lower his head. Dr. Evil kept spanking, focusing on Scott's sit spots and thighs. Soon Scott started sniffing, indicating he was softly crying. \"Do you think you can try to be good again, Scott?\" \"Yes,\" Scott said hesitantly. \"Ok, but don't think you won't end up right back here if you step out of line again.\" Dr. Evil said as he stood Scott up and pulled him into a hug. Scott buried his face into his dad's chest in embarrassment, but almost immediately the rest of his family had surrounded him in a big hug. Austin looked over his shoulder at Foxie, \"Maybe we can have a little spanky spanky later, baby?\" Foxie rolled her eyes and laughed.

Dr. Evil is not mine. Contains references to the movie JFK. Please see the endnotes when you see a random number shoved into the text. Austin Powers and the Magic Bullet: a Fictitious and Ridiculous Account of John F. Kennedy's Assassination In October of 1963, Dr. Evil was in the middle of his final year in Evil Medical School. In order to pay off his tuition, he worked as a physicist in the Department of Defense of the United States, for before he decided to become an evil doctor, he had studied to be a physicist—an evil physicist. Now it was simply a way to pay the bills. 1 Dr. Evil worked with a team of (evil) engineers and (evil) physicists to create what they dubbed the \"magic bullet.\" This \"magic bullet\" ran on magnetic power rather than electrical power in order to defy gravity. Its shell was made of a newly discovered alloy, Evilium, that was lighter than titanium and slightly harder than diamond. It was to be remote-controlled with a rather cumbersome control box similar in appearance to a video game console. There's more to the \"magic bullet's\" construction than that, but the technical explanation that I could have given you would be incomprehensible to any reader who has not passed second-year college physics with flying rainbow colors (which is why it is useless to even begin to explain it here). In theory, the \"magic bullet\" could not miss. Dr. Evil and his team of evil physicists and evil engineers conspired to murder John F. Kennedy, for he had cut funds to science in order to pour money into the war in Vietnam. Thirty-seven years in the future (autumn 2000), Austin Powers was sent back in time to November 1963 to stop the assassination from occurring so that Al Gore could be elected President of the United States instead of George W. Bush. 2 For if Bush were elected, he reasoned, he would make JFK's same mistake of cutting funds to education and sending the money to some war. (No such war had yet occurred, but with oil growing scarce, it was only a matter of time before the US decided to bomb the Middle East.) The time machine in MI6's 3 main building sent Austin to downtown Dallas, Texas on the morning of November 22, 1963. Austin's mission was to seize control of the \"magic bullet\" and foil the assassination attempt. At 12:00 PM, after careful observation of downtown 1963 Dallas's shops (and disappointment on not finding a pair of bell-bottomed pants he had wanted to buy), Austin set out to uncover the details of the assassination plot. The day's parade was just beginning; Austin didn't have much time to get to Dealy Plaza, where the assassination took— would take—place. The assassination would occur over a course of five seconds at 12:30 PM. Luckily, it wasn't far. It was 12:20 PM when Austin reached the overpass. He was out of breath from sprinting like a track star through the streets. He had arrived earlier than planned, so he decided to buy a Coke. Little did he know that the conspirators would arrive just as he left to satisfy his thirst. While Austin was buying his Coke, Dr. Evil stationed himself on the overpass, a place where the \"magic bullet\" would have a clear shot at the president. Plus, it was a wonderful day and there was a magnificent view of the landscape. When Austin was in line at a drug store waiting for his Coke, he momentarily had a light conversation about the weather with the customer in front of him, a well-dressed young man who mentioned that he worked at a book depository nearby and was on his lunch break. The young man was generous enough to buy Austin's Coke for him. They parted when they left the store. Austin casually glanced at his futuristic MI6-issue millenium wristwatch to find to his horror that it was 12:28 PM. He had exactly two minutes to get back to the overpass and foil the assassination. He tossed his Coke into the nearest trashbin and again sprinted on tiptoe like the aforementioned track star. He didn't dare look at his watch when he reached the overpass, for he immediately saw that Dr. Evil had been the mastermind behind the \"magic bullet\" whose legendary trajectory he had so often studied: it entered Kennedy's back, left Kennedy through the front of his throat, entered Senator Conolly's shoulder, shattered Conolly's wrist and then buried itself in Conolly's thigh before JFK's fatal headshot was fired. Austin tackled Dr. Evil to the ground just as the \"magic bullet\" had risen to life and begun its path through the air toward the limousine carrying the President. In a struggle that lasted seconds, Austin had begun wildly pressing buttons on the remote control, which—to Austin's terror—sent the \"magic bullet\" careening out of control as it paved its trajectory that would be recorded in history books from that day forward. In another split second, Dr. Evil had revealed his backup plan: he whipped a loaded revolver from his pocket and fired once in Kennedy's direction before pinching a pressure point behind Austin's neck (effectively knocking him out), jumping into his conveniently parked getaway car, and speeding away. By the time Austin rose to consciousness, it was too late to do or say anything other than return to the present. The President had been murdered, and an arrest had been made. Armed with the knowledge of the true JFK conspiracy testament—and his hard-learned lesson that it is impossible to reconfigure history (for the inevitable will always inevitably happen)—he returned to 2000.

The people listen to physicists because although they have no idea what the physicists are talking about, they still agree with whatever physicists say—their reasoning is that if someone is that wicked smart, they must be right. 2 It is a little-known fact that Austin was fond of American history and politics. 3 The Bristish version of the FBI.

I just heard the songn\"You who I cradled in my arms\" and thought \"Hmmm…. Soundsnlike something Frau would have sung to Scott as a baby.\" MUAHAHA!! \"Waaaaaah!!!nWaaah!!!\" FraunFarbissina woke up, groaning. Newborn Scott had woken up again! \"Gottnin Himmel, when is that kid gonna sleep nights?\" she thought as shendragged herself over to the bassinet and lifted him out. \"Shhh,nScott, be quiet, Mommy's here, Mommy's got you.\" she whisperednin German. Scott quieted down just slightly and stared up at hisnmother, who was by now getting a bottle out of the refrigerator. \"IsnScotty hungry? Does he want to eat? Scotty does! Scotty does!\" Withnthat, she began feeding him and softly singing. You who I cradled in my arms, you Asking as little as you can. Little snip of a little man. I know I'd give my life for you. Scottnwas Frau's love child with Dr. Evil, an evil doctor who ran an evilnorganization. Also in the organization were Mustafa and Number2, Dr.nEvil's henchmen. There was also an army of other henchmen whonseemed to serve no purpose. Recently, Dr. Evil had been frozen, justna few days before Frau realized she was \"late.\" By now, thenfather of her child was orbiting the Earth in a giant \"Big BoynBurger\" mascot. So, Frau had to go through her pregnancy bynherself. She was quite pissed about this. I mean, she had to do thenwhole Lamaze thing sans boyfriend. Finally, she went into labor. Itntook about 16 hours, but eventually her son was born. Everythingnseemed all right, until suddenly, Little Scott's heart rate racednout of control. The doctors frantically worked over him, but everyonenwas sure that the baby would die. Scott's heart did stop, actually,nbut the doctors gave him an electric shock to bring him back to lifenand slowed his heart with medication. It had been a close call. Toonclose. Frau held Scott and, crying, promised that she would never letnanything happen to him, even if the cost was her own life. You didn't ask me to be born, you Why should you learn of war or pain? To make sure you're not hurt again I swear I'll give my life for you. \"Scottnlooks just like Herr Doktor,\" Frau thought as she gazed down at hernsleeping infant. He had Dr. Evil's pale skin, his face, his nose,nhe even put his finger to his lip when he laughed. There were somendifferences. Scott had no scar, he had his mother's huge, darkneyes, and unlike Dr. Evil, Scott actually had hair. Herr Doktor. Frauncouldn't bear to think of him. He had been her true love, and nownhe was gone. Scott would never know his father, unless at some pointnhe came back, and what were the odds of that? Normally, Frau wasnextremely tough, seeming hard as a rock, but now she wept, knowingnthat she would never love another man. I've tasted love beyond all fear. And you should know it's love that brought you here. Alsonon Frau's mind was the issue of what to tell Scott about hisnparentage. Sooner or later, he would want to know. Number2 had toldnher that she should tell Scott that he was the result of annexperiment to artificially create an heir for Dr. Evil. But whatnchild wants to know that he's \"artificial?\" Besides, didn'tnthat mean she couldn't call herself his mother anymore? But then,nif she told him the truth, it might hurt him. Besides which, he mightnbe ostracized because he was born out of wedlock. She never couldntell if people still did that. Then, as if it fell from the unusuallynbright stars, an idea came to her. She would tell him nothing!nInstead, she would end it all tonight. And in one perfect night, When the stars burned like new, I knew what I must do. Fraunwent to her bureau and picked up the photo of her parents, CommandernMienherr Farbissina and Fraulein Farbissina. Everybody in her familynwas named after a title. Aside from them, she had eight siblingsnnamed Duke, Princess, King, Detektiv, President, First Lady, Queen,nand Mem Sahib. She picked up the photo and began talking to it. \"Fromnthis picture I keep, you, my parents look out, and your smiles shownno scorn.\" Frau stopped, thinking that she must be going crazy.nHere she was, quoting Miss Saigon , some musical Herr Doktornhad named a laser beam after. The sooner she got this overwith, thenbetter. She bid a final goodbye to her sleeping child, and left thenroom. I'll give you a million things I'll never own.

The night was young, and the starsnwere bright.

Then by my side the proof I see. His Little One. Gods of the Sun Bring him to Me!! Thisnwas it. It was now or never. She had to jump. She just had to. Then,nin the distance, a voice shouted. \"FRAU!!!nNO!!!!\" Fraunturned around and saw Number 2 panting. Scott had woken up again andncried, waking Number 2. The executive had gone into the room to seenwhat was the matter and found that Frau was nowhere to be seen. Henhad heard hurried footsteps in the direction of the roof. Henfollowed the noises and found Frau, just in time to stop her fromnending her life. \"Frau! You can't do this!

The air seemed heavier. My body felt magnetized, like I was being drawn down to the floor. Valentine said he would visit. He had left out when, but my mind hadn't processed that fact because I was stuck on how he declined to stay without hesitation. I walked over and closed my curtains. The moonlight peeked through the slits in the fabric, highlighting a pillow resting on my bed. Taking the invitation, I laid down, counting my slowing breaths. Mum woke me up, and I didn't fight getting up. I moved like my body was suspended in maple syrup. Confused, I couldn't figure it out. I felt energized enough; but I saw my arms blurred as I moved, out of focus as I saw each and every placement they went through as they swung by my side. I decided to ignore it, my lack of sleep probably to blame. Breakfast dragged along equally, and I didn't even notice I was halfway through the bus ride to school. At school I followed along a lot better, and found myself more engaged in my classes once I forgot about what happened at home. During lunch is when something weird entered my consciousness. I became more aware of a figure in my peripheral vision. They were very familiar, although I never looked him straight in the face while I was eating. When I was walking out the door, I finally caught a glimpse of him. He was seated at a square table, two other people flanking each side. They were all laughing, enjoying some witty comment the darker haired guy had said. His teeth flashed in a huge smile, and he lightly grabbed the back of his neck, next to this strawberry-blond hair, which I noted was short and gelled upwards. I gasped loud enough that a few girls sitting at a table near me looked up, eyebrows raised in question. Silently spinning around, I took off out the door, clenching my jaw that had embarrassingly dropped open for a second when I saw him. Stopped at a locker a few rows down, my mind braked as paused to comprehend what I at least thought I saw. The same Valentine doppelganger that I saw one day during class, while the real Valentine sat in my closet, was sitting in my cafeteria. Laughing. That day I was sure I had made a mistake. I turned around; still close enough to the lunchroom to see through the open door. And there he was. A strange pale leather jacket, brown pants; it was nowhere near as odd looking as Valentine's robe and slacks combination. However, there was something even more disturbing then his outfit, and the fact that he was still sitting at the table. He was actually staring back at me. His friends were still occupied with their food, but he was staring blankly at me. Hunched over the table, he sat absolutely still. Terrified, I backed up into the lockers, and ran down the hall. It wasn't until I was on the bus again that I had to do something. My options were limited, and my theories on how this was even possible kept jumping around my head. Was it possible that Valentine found a way in to my school from the City of Light? Or was there more then one Valentine? The idea scared me. Did this person even know they were my Valentine? I was silent through dinner, but my parents didn't mind. Aunt Nan was over, and she kept them busy with the drab details of her week. Moving my potatoes around, I waited a few minutes before I asked to be excused. My dad gave me a funny look but continued listening to Nan's stories. Upstairs, I cradled Valentine's puppet in my left hand. I wondered if there was some way to contact him, to ask him what was going on. I cautiously started focusing my thoughts, narrowing it down to chanting \"Valentine, where are you?\" in my head, while I closed my eyes, visualizing him. After a few minutes, I opened one eye. The room was silent, the sun quietly sinking in my window. I let out a defeated sigh. Telepathy was out. In that case, I'd have to get over shock of seeing Valentine's double and actually go up to him to find out what was going on. I fell asleep to worrisome images of what the conversation was going to be like. Math class started as dreary and uninteresting as the rain that pounded against the window outside. Mrs. Tweedy was drawing the equation for slope on the board, as I twiddled my thumbs in terror. How could ask him for the information about him and Valentine without looking like a complete idiot? What if he had no idea who I was talking about, and it all just a coincidence? The bell rang vigorously, and I strode last out the door into the writhing mass of bodies in the hallway. Over at my locker, a group of younger boys grouped around another, holding some video game in his hands. When I brushed passed them, they looked at me with irritated expressions. I reluctantly shuffled through the lunch line, snapping my neck around to see if he was here. Sure enough, he was seated at the same table. Oddly, he sat alone, eating a sandwich. As I paid and exited the line, I pretended to be looking for absent friends. I flitted glances from around the room, back to him. He wasn't facing me, and I swung a wide girth around him, opting for a small two-seater table along the wall opposite of him. I guess I put my tray down harder then I thought, because I saw him look up out of the corner of my eye. Gnawing on a pear, I faked trying to look bored. He went from looking absentminded to smug in an instant, gazing over at me. My blood boiled. He stood up lazily, like he was getting up to leave, when he paused. I felt my arms stiffen, and he slid his tray onto my table. I probably looked like as if I was shocked by a cattle prod. He kept a steady stare on me as I pulled my head up to look at him. \"Hi there. I noticed you have a blueberry muffin. I was wondering if you would like to trade me for a chocolate mousse. If that's alright.\" Was he kidding? \"Uh, um, sure. Why?\" I pushed my muffin over to him tentatively. He picked up his mousse and placed it on my tray, next to my arm. \"I'm allergic to chocolate. I grabbed it by accident.\" He smiled softly. \"Oh.\" I replied flatly. I wasn't expecting this at all. Not only did my conversation starter I had stored disappear altogether, I had no idea where this was headed. After a short silence, he coughed. \"So, um, my name is Terry…\" He trailed off, leaving an expectant pause. \"Helena.\" I said, quieter then I thought. It took me a second to realize he was trying to introduce himself. \"Ah. So, is lunch always this frightening?\" My eyes grew enormous. \"Oh! Oh no. No. It's the food. Are you new here?\" \"My second week. Yes, I'm quite appalled at the food here too. Very suspicious.\" He chuckled. \"Where are you from?\" I blurted out, so fast he flinched. \"About 30 miles north. Parent's job relocated. What about you?\" He gestured in my direction. \"My parents run the Campbell Circus, by the beach.\" His face lit up immediately. Just like Valentine. \"Really? Always loved the circus. What's your special talent?\" \"I just juggle, nothing really spectacular.\" This time he radiated pure excitement. \"Fascinating! How often do you perform?\" \"Oh, it's every weekend. In the evening. I train during the week.\" I abruptly stopped talking for a minute. I felt I had just told my life story to someone I wasn't even sure was the person I thought I knew. He leaned back, drinking in the circus information. He picked up my muffin, and tossed it around, between his palms. Then he snatched it and took a quick bite. \"Juggling is one of my hobbies.\" He remarked. I could only gawk at him more. \"I don't have food on my face, do I?\" He put down the muffin, suddenly wiping his jaw with his hands. \"N-No...\" I stuttered. Then I tried to reason with myself. Why was I afraid? Was I afraid he was some normal version of Valentine? Why would I be scared of that? Moving my tray I started to get up. It was almost time for my next class, but the clock was not what I was concerned about. Terry, as he called himself, looked up at me in surprise. \"Where are you going?\" He asked. \"I'm going to be late. For Literature class.\" I stopped staring at him and began to amble away. \"Oh..\" Terry's face looked a bit disappointed. I quickly made myself turn around and walk into the hallway. Later, as I sat on the smelly bus once again, I took out my black markers and scribbled shapes into my notebook. There was something about that Terry that made him different from Valentine. He had the same self-focused, self-absorbed aspect, but at the same time very curious. His eyes were the same sun-lit hazel. Then it suddenly came to me. When Terry stood up, he seemed almost my height. Just a smidge taller. But he was shorter then Valentine. \"That's weird.\" I spoke quietly to myself.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two Valentine woke up, yawning as he used his feet to feel for a steady surface. He'd fallen asleep in someone's junk room again, and he didn't want to put his feet down on a rake, like he did last time. He still had a bruise where the handle had hit him on the arm. He coughed as dust swirled around him, and he peered out a scummy window. It was definitely morning, the townsfolk were out and about. \"Wonderful.\" He muttered to himself. Out on the street, he negotiated around the busy shoppers and sellers, looking for a certain alleyway. He found the red carpeting hanging from the wall, and he started strolling down the dim, narrow alley. Further down, the path led upwards, over a hill, where a burgundy-bricked tower lay still, like an old tree. The tower had no reason to move anywhere; the occupants were quite happy to stay in the same place. Valentine slowly approached the door, sighing as he gave the triangular door-knocker a good three thumps on the heavy wooden door. \"Who IS it?\" A soprano voice wafted around in the air like a wayward kite. \"It's me, Auntie Kit, Valentine.\" He drew out the sentence in an impatient tone. \"Oh Valentine! I was wondering where you were!\" A husky lady opened the door. Her blue and orange octagonal mask barely covered her face, and her wild, brown curly hair was pushed back in all different directions. Gauzy orange cloth was wrapped around her torso, covering some shabby brown pants and a ragged brown shirt. \"I was worried you'd forgotten. The tea and cakes are ready!\" He hunched over and staggered into the petite opening of the door. \"You really ought to fix this door.\" He remarked. Auntie Kit ignored him. Valentine sat down at a small rectangular and dusty green table, laden with all kinds of pastries. The tea sat in a large lavender pot, steam rising from the top. \"Smells exquisite, Auntie.\" \"Tastes even better, my dear.\" She exclaimed happily. He sat down and immediately poured himself a cup of the tea, then shoved the nearest cake into his mouth. \"Now dear, I didn't teach you to eat like an animal.\" She said. \"Sorry Auntie Kit…\" Valentine apologized halfheartedly. \"So tell me, where have you been these past days?\" He paused. \"Just out practicing me art, looking for a fiddler…\" \"Now you couldn't have been out all those days just looking for a fiddler…\" Valentine paused again. \"You probably wouldn't believe me if I tried to tell you.\" Auntie Kit sat and waited, a patient smile creeping over her lips. He sighed deeply. \"Fine. You know when Torrey went missing a few weeks ago? Mum got all upset, said he had gone to find better job?\" \"Yes, your poor Mum. She just couldn't figure out why he wouldn't want to continue creating that wonderful music for the Queen.\" She held her hands together tightly. \"Well, I found where he'd run off to. I went there me self.\" \"To where, dear?\" \"Auntie, have you ever wondered if there's more out there than the City of Light, The Dark Palace?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Auntie Kit, there is somewhere beyond this place. Where people don't wear masks, where the cities are enormous, lights everywhere, people without masks everywhere, they wear strange clothes, ride in strange carriages. Most of them look like us, only…only more boring. Well, except my friend Helena…\" \"Oh my. How do they know how people are feeling without their masks?\" \"That's what I said. But Helena and the others are able to make, \"faces\", if you will. They're able to communicate quite clearly.\" \"Helena you say?\" Valentine stopped. He forgot he hadn't mentioned her before. \"She's....a friend I met in the other world. I met her...while I was looking for Torrey.\" His voice wavered slightly. \"Valentine,\" Auntie Kit's voice sharpened with suspicion, \"how were you able to travel to this....other world?\" A heart-pounding silence filled the room, and Valentine's loud gulp of air echoed around the kitchen. He suddenly gripped the table tight, and got to his feet. \"Deary...\" \"Fine fine...\" He took a shallow breath. \" When the White Queen fell asleep, and the shadows came, I went to help. Everybody was looking for some sort of charm. I... went looking for it at the Orbitning Giants, I went to the Dark Palace..\" \"Oh yes! I remember now. Weren't they looking for a princess?\" She interrupted. \"Yes, Auntie, but nevermind that, I found the charm! It was some sort of Mirrormask. It can transport you to the world Torrey went off to! Aren't you listening to me?\" She was very still, one arm raised to her mouth, fingers curled around her chin. It was as if she knew something and yet had a million questions to ask. \"I think I've hear of that Mirrormask somewhere..\" \"What?\" \"That mask. Something about it wasn't right.\" \"Like what?\" Valentine's voice was full of skepticism. \"Where is the mask now?\" Auntie Kit worried. \"What? I have it.\" She stared at him gravely. \"Dear, please promise me something. When you go back to that other world to get Torrey, be careful.\" \"Promise.\" He said with a warm smile.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three Politely as I could, I gave my thanks to Auntie Kit, and squeezed out the irritatingly cramped front door. I swear, I don't know what that woman was thinking; putting in a door she could scarcely fit through herself. Sometimes it was hard imagining her as my mother's sister. Course, I hadn't seen me mother in years, so maybe they did look alike now… I wandered back down the path, a few minutes until I was back at the end of the alley I had come down from. The streets were nearly deserted as I came out by a long stretch of shops. The sun had sunk very low, casting a ruddy orange glow through the street. Shuffling, I roamed through the empty street, staring up at the melting sky. The stars began to come out, glittering faintly. They were dimmer then they had been the previous nights, but still as stunning as they were the night after the White Queen had woken up. I shook my head as my thoughts shifted towards old memories. I needed to concentrate at the situation at hand. \"Torrey… what're you doing?\" I whispered to the vacant plaza I walked into. My brother was not known for pulling stunts like this. He was the good boy, mum's favorite; the good brother. He had a respectable job he didn't have to be ashamed of, good looks, a bigger tower…. That stopped my jealous brooding. If he was gone, what was going to happen to the tower? His tower was probably furious. Not a good thing. Torrey didn't even leave a note or anything. The only way I had found out he had somehow made it to Helena's world was the strange phenomenon that Helena said she experienced, the first time I met her. She looked into windows and saw herself, only it wasn't her, it was the Dark Princess. She had stolen the mirrormask in order to escape, and took over Helena's life on the other side. Only it was happening to me, minus the evil girl. Except, it wasn't the windows that let me see what Torrey was doing. It was something much more dreadful and…disgusting. I let out a annoyed sigh as I approached the mask shop, knowing the batty old nag inside was waiting for me with a boring, unnecessarily long story. As soon as I opened the door, a menacing looking sphinx stared back at me from atop the front desk. Its' dull purple face didn't look happy to see me at all. \"Hello there…\" I mumbled nervously. The sphinx snarled at me, and hopped away. \"Valentine, dear, is that you? Have I got a story for you today!\" The owner cheerfully cried out. \"Fantastic…\" I replied, rolling my eyes as I stepped into the tea room. Cynthia, as I previously learned she called herself, came into the room and chattered absent-mindedly on the couch, thinking I was actually listening. Looking around the room, I waited a few seconds before I decided to interrupt her. \"Cynthia, do you mind if I use your restroom? Moving her head, she abruptly ceased her story telling. \"Oh! Of course deary. Right over there to the left.\" She said in her warbly voice. I already knew where the washroom was, but she nevertheless told me each time I came to use it. My feet slowly edged into the room, and I closed the door behind me, so she assumed I was not listening and wouldn't keep talking. Reluctantly, I leaned down against the window by the toilet. Muffins, the laziest sphinx I had ever seen, was once again, curled up in the toilet bowl. Weird little creature. \"Out you go. Shoo. I need some, quality time, with your bed.\" I wasn't afraid of Muffins, he was always too tired to even growl, let alone maul me. His beady little eyes winced, and he scrambled out of the bowl in one jump. He slinked over to the sink, dripping a trail of water along the floor, and climbed inside there instead. \"Bloody thing…\" I muttered to him. Peering into the bowl, the water that was left at the bottom reflected at first only my face. Concentrating, a scene began to become visible in the pool. I could see Torrey, walking around, maskless. From his hair to his chin, he was my complete double. The only thing different about him was his height. For his age, he was on the short side. Probably the only good thing that separated me from him. He was walking in a crowded hallway, filled with younger kids filing past him . One day I had come searching for Torrey at the mask shop, and when I went into the bathroom, I had stumbled accidentally onto this window to Helena's world. I knew he was in Helena's world from the time I was first able to see him in this toilet window. No masks at all, the strange clothes on everyone. It was a few views later that I also saw Helena. She had been alone, slowly walking through a door and stood still by a long table, as the other kids around her were eating. Torrey had sat down at another table before she had entered the room, and was making friends with two other guys seated around him. He was cracking jokes, and they all laughed heartily. Helena's usually animated face was vacant as she gazed at him, with the exception of her very large, very shocked eyes. A thought had entered my mind, and I instantly knew what was going on. She thought Torrey was myself. And I wasn't supposed to be there. Because as far as I knew, and I think she knew too, I was not coming back. Not because I didn't want to, I knew I couldn't because I was too attached. All I wanted to do was be with her. But I saw the consequences of leaving this world, and staying in her world longer then you were allowed. The world fell apart. Violently. The time before, it shook apart, but I know it wasn't just the Princess's fault. Our world did not react well to elements coming and going from it. I didn't want to be responsible for that. Yet I couldn't allow Torrey to let it happen either. Once our world fell, everyone in it would be gone. I'd be gone, Torrey would be gone, Auntie Kit, Cynthia. And Helena. I didn't know what would happen to her, but I would never see her again. I had to bring Torrey back before it was too late. \"How….\" I answered my thoughts aloud. Muffins looked up, irritated at my voice. I stared back, and he finally went back to sleep. Glancing back at the bowl, I went back to spying on Torrey. He was sitting in another room, at a desk, with other kids sitting around him, in identical desks. A tall, lanky looking man with a grey mustache and no hair on his head was talking, tossing his hands around sluggishly. During these glimpses, I cannot hear any sound, but what he was talking about must have been boring, because Torrey was nodding off. I saw Helena again, but she was seated farther back, by a window. She was not nodding off. Alert and very concerned looking, she looked like she was about to go to pieces. I felt helpless, and I could not stand seeing her like that. I pushed off the ground away from the bowl, and stood up quickly. I had to go get him.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four Her fingers held her notebooks firmly in her arm, while she scurried down the hallway to her next class. Helena tried to slow down to delay her entrance, but to no avail. She was just going to have to deal with. The door swung wide as she tried to saunter normally into class. It worked, until she went to sneak a quick look around the classroom. A few minutes later teacher walked in after her, but she took no notice. Terry , seated in the middle, was already staring with deep concentration at Helena. Hardly fooling him, she pretended to disregard him and took her seat by the window. Terry was becoming increasingly annoying. While Mr. Lokin droned on with his lesson of the day, Helena leaned her head on her right fist, too absorbed in thought to listen. Suddenly, she heard the whisking of paper sliding against a desk, and something lightly touched her elbow. Looking down, it was a folded piece of notebook paper. She carefully picked it up and opened it. Scribbled in messy cursive, a short sentence framed the top of paper. \"So, how are you doing today?\" Helena craned her head down, and read it again. She knew it was from Terry. No one else in this class talked to her. \"Why in the world is he talking to me?\" she thought. The casualness of the note stunned her. Wasn't it obvious to from the rudeness she expressed in their last conversation that she didn't want to talk to him? Annoyed, she crumpled the paper into a small ball and tossed it under her desk. Soon another folded letter flew across the room and landed on her desk. This time she turned her head and shot him a nasty look. He was smiling like an idiot. \"Knock it off.\" Helena mouthed silently to him, her brows furrowed in frustration. Terry bent down, jotted down something on a slip of paper, folded it, and flicked it her way. It landed with the same accuracy as the others did, by her clenched fist, resting on the surface of the table. \"Angry I suppose then? What did I do?\" read the letter. Fed up, she flipped the paper over, and forcefully carved the words \"First off, your going to get us in trouble, second…\"Helena hesitated. Thinking of letting her theory run out on the paper for just a moment, she decided against it. \"…Second, you are getting on my nerves, don't you have anyone else to bother?\" She then flicked the note back to him, however missing his desk. Terry was quickly able to catch it in his hand before it made it to the floor. Opening it, she saw him smirk, and then write down a response on the same side. The note skittered across her desk once again. The first line said, \"I seriously doubt that.\" The second line said \"Come to think of it, I don't believe I do have anyone else to bother…besides, this is fun!\" \"He's just bothering me for his own entertainment!\" She thought to herself furiously. This time, she smashed the paper together and threw it at him, not caring whether or not it made it to his desk. The crinkled paper lightly bounced off Terry's head, making him recoil with surprise. The amused look on his face vanished as he picked the paper up, looking at her now with unease. Helena gazed blankly towards the teacher, while he slouched down in his chair. The bell rang, and the students around them scrambled out of their seats and proceeded out the door. She got up and followed them, vaguely aware that Terry was only a few steps behind her. Once she was out in the hall, she hastily walked to her locker, and began to open it. Suddenly Terry ambled over behind her. \"Look, I didn't mean to make you mad, I was only trying to make conversation…\" He trailed off. She swung around to face him vehemently, her eyes throwing imaginary daggers at him. He flinched. \"Ah! What the…Why is it you have such a problem with me? I'm just talkin'…\" \"Where's…your…tower?\" She slowly hissed at him, interrupting the middle of his sentence. Terry paused, baffled. \"What?\" She stepped towards him, now right next to his face. \"I said, where's your tower?\" she murmured. Her eyes were now glaring into his hazel ones, waiting for an answer. \"I….\" He stepped back, not expecting her intense movement. Then he straightened up, and closed his mouth tightly. His face was still confused. Helena then twisted around, and marched down the hall towards her last class, leaving Terry in the hallway alone, scratching his head. \"Who are you…\"He whispered to himself. Instead of drawing, Helena took out notebook and began her math homework in the waning light of her window. It was distracting work, and she started to relax, her mind off the previous events at school. By the time it was finished, the moon had already risen, and she could hear her parents causally talking over the quiet din of the TV. in their room. Yawning loudly, she shuffled over to her bed and submerged into a quiet sleep. Meanwhile, Torrey was wandering to through the black streets to the apartment he shared with his dark-haired friend from school, Adrien. Adrien's parents had separated when he was 10, his father went to live somewhere in Asia, leaving him with his mother until she died in a car crash when he was 16. He now lived by himself in his three bedroom flat, and had a job to put him through school, with occasional checkups from a Child Welfare Services agent named Rufus. Torrey met him while he wandered around town, and had stopped in to explore the school during lunch hour, and they became good friends. He was glad Adrien had accepted him so easily; he had grown tired of camping in a condemned office building near the wharf. The customs were strange, but he was happy to have some companionship while he explored this new world. \"Hey mate, what's up? Lasagna?\" Adrien greeted him as he came in the door, pointing to a plastic dish full of oozing pasta and tomato sauce. \"Um, no thanks, I already ate.\" He lied, as he eyed the food. The food, it turned out, was the only thing people here had trouble making. Not like palace food. Torrey gave a weak smile, and headed upstairs towards his small and sparsely furnished room. He hadn't brought many things with him when he used the mirrormask, but he would find a way to live without some of his luxuries. After all, he thought, this world has plenty of opportunities He had already sold most of his possessions he did bring for money to pay Adrien rent, so he could spend more time looking for a job that stood out to him. He already was beginning to grasp how the society here worked, the reason for this thing called \"school\" he had learned was mandatory for everyone his age. Apparently what was considered normal behavior for kids was not to go exploring about unattended by some blathering adult. It was just this Helena character. She had thoroughly frightened him today. Was he hearing things when she had mentioned a tower? Surely he was mistaken. Nobody else suspected he wasn't of this world Yes, she was cute and spunky, that was why she had attracted his attention. But was she insane? She was ignoring him, acting as if he had the plague. Yet, for what reason? Was it she somehow knew about the other world? That was preposterous. Nobody knew. He decided that she was just a deranged, pretty girl who had no idea what she was talking about. Torrey rocked back and forth on his heels, admiring the view from his lone window. Sighing, he took up his mandolin, and plucked a simple, slow melody.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five I was being enveloped in a heavy mist, and time itself felt like was being dragged along the ground. Walking slowly, I navigated with my hands outstretched, afraid I was going to bump into something in this strange, empty space. It went on forever, and I tried calling out, but it seemed to be devoid of anything. I couldn't really even figure out how I was able to walk, as it seemed there was no floor. The air was stagnant, and I began to feel the humidity spike, and the air warmed up rapidly. Sweating, the heat clung to my skin, and I found it harder and harder to breathe. The mist seemed thicker, and I realized it was smoke. The heat soon became overwhelming. My head swirled, and my thoughts didn't make any sense anymore. What was this? Why was I here? Again I tried calling out for help, for someone, anyone…I wasn't going to make it much longer…. Unexpectedly, I felt a coolness across my forehead, and soon it extinguished the heat and the smoke around me. I gasped loudly for air, thankful to breathe again. Everything went dark, but I was aware of myself. My vision gradually came back, and I made out the end of my bed, while the moon was gleaming bright through my window. However, I soon made out a figure sitting on the right side of me, staring me down. The room was very hazy, and I thought I saw smoke winding along my walls and up over my blanket. Maybe I was dreaming, maybe my room had been on fire. Or my room had been that blank void. Everything still was jumbled, and I wasn't sure if any of this was real or not. The figure on the bed came into view, even though I couldn't open my eyes all the way. It was Valentine. His mask was off, and his makeup was already washed off, unusual for him. Or was it Terry? \"Terry!?\" I asked with alarm. My voice was still weak, so it barely came out of my mouth at all. \"Terry?…I believe the name you're looking for is Valentine.\" \"Valentine!\" I tried to sound excited, but I still couldn't trust what I was seeing or hearing. Smoke started to whirl around him, and the heat came back for a minute. The refreshing feeling returned as his arm reached up and touched my forehead. \"Do you feel any better? Your not looking so good.\" He questioned me, his voice dropping low with anxiety. \"Yeah, thank you for making the fire go away,\" was all I could think of to say. His face soured. \"So are you here, or are you not? I'm not even sure I'm in my room…\" \"Hmm. Helena…I'm afraid I'm not…here.\" I frowned. I really wanted him to be here. This dream was annoying the hell out of me. \"You need to get some rest. I'm sure if you sleep you'll feel better.\" He mumbled quietly. I felt his hand touch the side of my cheek, and he smoothed a lock of hair that was in my eyes. I smiled, but I instantly felt exhausted. Closing my eyes, I struggled to say goodbye. \"Why don't you stay? I don't want this to be over yet.\" I incoherently muttered. \"Sleep.\" He insisted. I finally shut my eyes, and allowed the haze to float over me as I fell asleep. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- He got off her bed, assured that she was too worn out to try and fight off sleep. Valentine carefully slipped the damp washcloth from her head, and walked to the bathroom with it. Turning the tap, he let it soak in cold water before turning it back off and returning back to Helena's room, gently placing it back on her forehead. \"That should do it.\" He said quietly, so she wouldn't wake up again. After making the decision to come back and find Torrey, Valentine reluctantly picked the mirrormask out of his pocket, and used to return to Helena's world, preparing himself by changing clothes and removing his mask beforehand. This time it had plopped himself down in front of her bed, but she hadn't stirred from the sound of him dropping on the floor. It was dark, night time. She was supposed to be sleeping. Peering over her quilt, he noticed she was talking in her sleep, and sweating profusely. He tiptoed to her side, touching her forehead with the back of his hand, pulling it away in shock as he felt a burning sensation. She was very sick, and her breaths were becoming increasingly deep and raspy. Racing to the bathroom, he snatched a blue rag that was folded over a towel rack and ran it under some cold water. He then went to her bedroom and laid it on her forehead. That was when she had woken up, and in a confused manner, attempted to talk to him. She had called him Terry, and for a minute Valentine thought she had said Torrey. That spooked him, but it was Terry, and he thought maybe she was referring to someone else. To comfort her, he corrected her, as the way she said Terry sounded like she was afraid of this person. She had seemed delighted when he mentioned himself. Valentine was puzzled, however, by the fire she had mentioned to him. She was on fire? It must be the fever, he thought. It was raging out of control. Hopefully the wet rag was helping. Although, he didn't mind that it was messing with her train of thought, making it seem like she was just dreaming. It would be better if she thought he was just a figment of her imagination, because he could not stay very long. He'd come back later, to check on her one last time, but his priority was to go get Torrey and bring him back to his world, before anything else happened, to Helena or anyone else. Standing back, he watched her, listening to her breathing become slower and more even as she slept. Satisfied, he moved closer to the window, and unlatched it. \"Goodbye.\" He whispered hoarsely, and plummeted out the window.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six Plodding along the boardwalk, Torrey looked up towards the gulls that were crying above him. They screeched as they lazily darted up and around the grey swells beyond the beach. The sky was overcast, but the air was still warm. Since it was the weekend, he learned he didn't need to go to the school, so he had decided to go out and explore the southern side of town. Adrien could not come with him, saying he had a date with a girl from class, but he was the one who suggested the southern part, giving him directions to the beach. Torrey didn't mind, he didn't understand the complicated relationships that the boys here had with girls anyway, so he didn't ask about it. He was admiring the churning water when a large red object caught his eye. He turned his head, and the red object became instantly familiar. It was a bright, shining circus tent, further down the boardwalk. Excitedly, he trotted towards it with a big smile draped across his face. As he neared it, he could smell the popcorn, and a line of people weaved in and out around the main tent, leading all the way out to the path. \"Excuse me,\" he asked, poking a short, white-haired man with a tweed jacket on the shoulder. \"…but where does this line go to?\" The old man glanced at him amiably, his cloudy blue eyes squinting. \"Why, this is for the Campbell Circus. Been coming to see it for years. Best circus I've ever seen…\" \"Would you happen to know at what time it is starting? This evening?\" he gazed past the line, towards the far side of the main tent. A throng of clowns and masked people were striding in and out of a slit in the tent material. \"Oh, they start about eight o'clock every night, never late. You getting a ticket, lad?\" \"Not right now, but I'll get one soon enough.\" He began to move around the man. \"You might want to hurry, you only have about forty-five minutes until they start!\" His call faded, as Torrey walked past the line, around the outer edge of the circus grounds. He casually went past the ticket booth, hiding behind a white horse that was being led to the area where the trailers were kept. As he neared the other entryway, the person leading the horse turned off the right, and he snuck quietly to the tent. Jumping behind a trash bin, a black and white painted clown suddenly emerged from the tent flap. When she was gone, he slipped into the main tent. Inside, the dim lights cast a dull, orange light on the scene unfolding within. Masked people dressed in a dazzling array of colors swept before him, and he heard the sounds of violins and accordions. Some were talking amongst themselves, twirling juggling balls and batons in their hands. One man was lighting and relighting a long stick, which he then playfully plunked into his mouth and quickly pulled out again. Torrey saw a pile of masks and scarves next to a wooden barrel, and he promptly grabbed out a small white mask, decorated with curling plaster whiskers around the edges and painted with orange and red dots. He also found a shimmering blue-knotted scarf, and tied it around his head. Pretending to be cleaning a rusty birdcage that was sitting in a stark area of the tent, the activity began to pick up, and the atmosphere buzzed with noise and energy. No one seemed to notice him. \"Laaaadies and gentlemaaaan, boooooys and girrrrrrls, are you ready to be thrilled to the very cores of your souls?\" A great rumbling voice vibrated in the air, and an even bigger noise responded as he heard the crowd roar. He made his way to a small hole cut in the tent's cloth, and he saw a scrawny man wearing a silver top hat and a ruby red mask open his arms out to the audience as they cheered. \"Then please put your hands together, for the lovely, Joanne of the Spanish Web!\" The audience exploded, as a woman in a glittering indigo leotard walked out of the far right side, and strode up to the ringmaster. Then he ran off, and she grasped a long rope hanging down from the ceiling, and climbed up. Torrey looked her over carefully, but she was far older and taller then Helena. She had the same grace that Helena had, he noticed, but it was definitely not her. Perhaps, he thought, Helena was dressed as a clown or something. Standing back from his peephole, he looked about the tent. There were fewer people scurrying around him, and it appeared most of the performers were huddled on the opposite side, where Joanne had made her entrance into the ring. Adjusting the curly mask on his face, he slowly moved closer to the other performers, but remained against the outer edge of the tent. He was glad he had decided to wear his normal clothing out, as the others were dressed in a fashion similar to him, which he thought was strange. In his head, he wondered if they too led the double life, being from the land of Light and Dark, but living in this strange world. As he scanned the other performers, some having light-hearted conversations with others, he saw a recognizable figure. They were short, wearing a shiny, dark green leotard, with a simple black eyemask over their face. Wispy, brown hair stuck out under the mask's string. \"Yeah, I was just telling him, he doesn't need the rubber chicken, he's pretty good all by himself, if he would just lay off the horrible ventriloquist act, he'd be fine.\" Helena's soft voice said, loud enough for him to hear. The people standing next to her laughed with gusto. \"I think May has had enough of that, I heard she threw out that chicken yesterday.\" A squat man in a heavy yellow mask exclaimed, and shook his head. \"Poor Henry, I think he was attached to that thing. Wouldn't talk about it.\" Another person, a gangly woman in a violet eyemask chuckled, and patted the squat man on the shoulder. They all laughed lightly. \"Oh, that's me. Can you hand me those juggling pins?\" Helena said, thanking them as she rushed out the parted curtains next to the group. The booming staccato voice was unintelligible the closer Torrey walked to where the people were standing. He faced away from the performers and peeked through a slit in the curtains. She was set across from the ringmaster, who was now dressed in white overcoat, and had taken off his hat. They were juggling white pins back and forth to each other, her smile astounding in the muted spotlights of the tent. \"Wow…\" he muttered as he stared at them. They were perfectly in sync, not missing a beat. Soon the orchestra, which he noted was a few notches out of tune, stopped, the audience applauded and she darted back to the entrance. When she appeared out in front of him, the large group of performers applauded her as well, and some gave her a few hugs. Visibly exhausted, she trotted over to a small water cooler. She took a large gulp from one of the little cups that were stacked on it, her eyes closed in relief. He took a few steps closer to her. When she opened her eyes, she stepped back in surprise. Coughing, she covered her mouth. \"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, so startled me!\" She looked up at him, first with a friendly smile, which turned into a suspicious glare. \"Excuse me, but I believe that's Henry's mask, and you're not Henry.\" Her eyebrows furrowed. Torrey raised up his arm, and slid the mask off his face. Helena's eyes widened, and she gasped. \"What are YOU doing here?\" She growled ferociously. \"You said you worked at the circus, so I thought I'd drop by.\" Torrey grinned slyly. She shoved him, and walked over to a steamer trunk, where all the masks lay in a heap. \"You're lucky that was my last act. Now get out of here.\" She hissed, her back turned as she took off her eyemask. \"Well, I actually came here to ask you a few things…\" He said courteously. She ignored him, throwing miscellaneous scarves and articles of clothing that had fallen on the floor back into the streamer trunk. \"How did you know about my tower?\" He demanded. Helena stood up stick straight. Pivoting around to stare at him, he didn't move. \"You looked like someone I knew…tell me your real name.\" \"It's Torrey actually. Not very creative, I'm afraid.\" Her face was unreadable. She then turned around, and walked out the back entrance, towards the trailers, finding her small one tucked behind her parents' trailer. Terry ran after her, hands shoved into his pants' pockets. \"Wait!\" he yelled. Helena ran up the stairs into her trailer, and he followed her. She heard the door slam, and turned around to face him. \"Do you know a Valentine?\" She asked forcefully, in the darkness, the only light the bright neon ones coming from the lights outside. \"He's my brother.\" He said quietly. They both were silent as the revelation sat in the air, stagnant. With a sigh, Terry broke the calm. \"So, how do you know him?\" \"I created him. And I suppose along the way, I created you too.\" She said breathlessly, and sat down on her bed. Terry's face contorted, confused. \"Created?\" He asked. \"I drew the City of Light and the City of Dark. And Valentine, well…he's a wooden marionette I made. They were all just… in my head.\" \"Not anymore…\" He muttered softly. Walking over to her, he sat down next to her on the bed. \"How did you get here? Why did you come?\" \"I used this mirrormask…\" He pulled an inky blue, shiny vinyl mask out of his pocket. \"It was boring in that world, so I thought maybe the mask would take me somewhere more…interesting. My old job was just dull as anything…\" \"What did you do there?\" she said. \"I used to play this,\" he pulled his mandolin off the cord strapped to his back, \" for the Queen of Light's orchestra. But I find the \"school\" thing much more fun. Especially since most of the lessons are incredibly easy, and you seem to have such a hard time learning anything.\" He giggled. \"I am NOT stupid, in fact I think you got most of the answers wrong on the last test we had in Mathematics.\" \"You keep telling yourself that…\" Torrey replied smugly. She glared at him. \"Why are you in here anyway?\" \"Well…\" he took a breath, \"I think we got off on the wrong foot, and I was hoping we could patch things up. Be friends.\" Gazing at his face, she couldn't help but notice the same twinkling glow that she had also seen in Valentine's. \"You and him are so very much alike… and yet different.\" She whispered. \"Hmm.\" He exhaled noisily. \"You are somethin' else.\" He paused, and then suddenly, he leaned in, and kissed her on the mouth. Her eyes were still open, caught off guard. Baffled by the familiarity of the intense pressure and pleasure that she felt when she kissed Valentine, she immediately pulled away, knowing that it wasn't him. \"What? What happened?\" A confused Torrey asked. He tried leaning close to her again, but she held her palm up. \"No. Please. You need to leave.\" She said, distraught. \"But why?\" He got up, but was persistent. \"This isn't right. Now go.\" She was now pushing him out the door of the trailer. Once he was outside, Helena slammed the door in his face. Stunned and a little angry, Torrey walked away, saying things under his breath. Inside, Helena was coiled up on her bed, hugging her knees, shaking her head. She was unsure what to think.[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven The air was crisp, and Valentine counted the puffs of white vapor that floated into the air as he breathed in and out. Even though the end of spring was coming, the nights were still tinged with cold winds. His shadow stretched out before him as he walked down the zigzagging maze of concrete walls. The sky was hardly visible above him, and it was devoid of stars. Valentine sighed quietly as he looked up at the dismal sight. This world wasn't nearly as colorful or interesting as the Land of Light and Dark, it was no wonder Helena had started drawing it. A sharp breeze picked up, and scattered some newspapers down towards the end of the alley, and it gave him goose bumps on the back of his neck. Without warning, the scuffling of footsteps echoed off the barren walls. In a terrified moment, he had clumsily sprung behind a small trashcan. Panting hard, he peeked around the side. All he saw was the menacing black shadows that awaited him at the end of the path. Relieved, he let out an intense lungful of air and laid his head back against the hard stone. Valentines were not known for their bravery. The sound of footsteps faintly reverberated around the alley again, and this time he slid out of his hiding place, and strode nervously to the end of the alleyway. The hum of cars along became louder, and he saw that it led out to a somewhat busy street, flanked with narrow sidewalks. Feeling more at ease, he stepped out into the open, watching as yellow taxis and shiny cars zoomed past him in the dim lights of the city. \"Scuse' me.\" A gruff voice grumbled as a heavy-set man walked around him. Valentine turned his head as he suspiciously gazed after him. Looking around, he saw two shorter figures leisurely strolling in his direction. He twisted around, his back to the strangers as they got nearer. \"Yeah, I'm going with Ashley, who are you going with?\" One of the figures asked in a mellow tone. \"Umm…ahh…this girl…you may know her, Helena? Her family runs the circus by the beach.\" Valentines' head snapped towards the two, his ears recognizing the unsure boy's response. His eyes narrowed, and he slowly began to follow them. \"Helena Campbell? Sure. Yeah she's…interesting. She's in one of my classes. But Helena's been acting kind of strange lately.\" \"…. Really? Well…. she is sort of strange.\" Torrey gave a smug chuckle. \"If she's so strange, why are you taking her to the dance then?\" \"Haven't you noticed, Adrien? She's totally hot! Of course I'm taking her.\" Now Valentine clenched his fists with a frightening ferocity, and moved behind them, being careful to keep a long enough distance between him and the two boys. He was relieved to have finally found him, but that feeling was soon overwhelmed by his intense anger. How dare Torrey talk about Helena like that! \"Whatever man…\" The other boy muttered. He didn't say it like he was disagreeing, but he sounded uninterested. There was a short silence as the boys neared an Italian restaurant. \"Well, I'll probably be back late. Don't wait up.\" The boy named Adrien said. \"See you,\" Torrey replied in a semi-disappointed tone. Torrey continued walking down the sidewalk, towards some residential neighborhoods. Valentine saw his chance to spring into action quickly getting away. As his brother continued towards some tall hedges, he ran and grabbed his shoulders, jerking him around to a shaded spot on the other side of the bushes. \"Waahhhh! Ahh! Please! Please don't hurt me!\" Torrey wailed pathetically as Valentine held him face to face with him. His brother's face was twisted, waiting for some inevitable punch in the face, while squeezing his eyes shut. \"Oh hush, you ninny. It's me. Open your eyes.\" Slowly, Torrey peeked open one eye, then the other. Than he bent over, gasping in relief. \"Valentine! Fancy meeting you here! What are you tryin' to do, kill me?\" His voice became louder as he said the words \" kill me\". \"You! You got some nerve, y'know that? I've been lookin' everywhere for you, and you're not even supposed to be here!\" Valentine vented in anger. He pointed a lone, accusing finger at him. \" What the hell are you doing here?\" He asked, in such a fierce tone that his brother sported a slightly scared expression on his face. \"…. What, you thought I was going to waste my talents in that city for the rest of my life?\" \" You could'a gone anywhere, anywhere!\" Valentine moaned. \" Why did you have to come here!\" He paused for a minute. \" Maybe a better question is how…did you get here.\" Then he crossed his arms across his chest. A familiar smugness came over Torrey's face. \" Well how did YOU get here?\" The two brothers stood in the moonlight, staring each other down. \" Fine.\" Valentine gave in. Reaching into his robe pocket, he took out the silver Mirrormask. It glittered in the pale light. \"Oh, that's a pretty one.\" Torrey said with mostly genuine fascination. He pulled out a smaller indigo colored one that gleamed with a liquid-type quality. \" I've heard of the Mirrormasks. Way back. Mum used to tell me stories about them.\" \" Okaaaaay. Well how did you get that one?\" Valentine asked. Torrey folded his arms, his expression an impatient one. \"Oh alright! When the Dark Princess went missing, this was what all the trouble was about. It was a…gift they gave me.\" He then waved his hand towards Torrey to give him his Mirrormask story. \" I was near the borderlands on a walk, and this bizarre little man, er..maybe he was a bird…he was all shiny, with black feathers. He said he was selling some things, watches, scraps of metal…and then he pulled this out. He didn't seem to know what it was, or was for, so he just gave it to me, for free. I knew it was a Mirrormask, so I used it to escape that dreary town and it brought me here.\" \" You took something from a complete stranger? How stupid can you be?\" Valentine stopped and shook his head in annoyance. \" Torrey…ya can't stay here…\" \"Why not? I've got a lot of good things going for me here. Why should I leave? And how do you know Helena?\" He replied defiantly. \" Because—…\" The last question caught Valentine off guard. \" I…. well she kind of made the City, she traveled to it to save the White Queen. I met her in the City,\" he said in a hurried tone. \"You stay away from her,\" he threatened. \" Look, you can't be here. You're putting me, you, and Helena in danger.\" \"What danger? I don't see any danger,\" Torrey scoffed. He slowly began placing himself between the street and Valentine. \" You have to believe me, it doesn't seem like it now but sooner or later something bad is going to happen,\" Valentine pleaded with him. There was a long pause, and Torrey scrunched his face up like he was thinking hard. Suddenly, he stepped backwards. \" Ahh, y'know what? I rather stay here,\" he concluded. He then raised one arm, and without warning, he was gone, as a rumbling monstrous machine roared past. Racing out to the street, Valentine saw Torrey waving and smiling, as he gripped an outer railing of a city transit bus, than climbed onto its roof as it rounded a bend in the road. \"No! Torrey! Get back here!\" Valentine shouted, to no avail. His brother vanished into the shadow of the night. He groaned in frustration in the middle of the empty road, hands holding his head. \" That little…\" he started to say through clenched teeth. Valentine just shook his head, and looked down the road towards the dim lights of the city. ","Summary":" Chapter One I cringed. The air seemed heavier.

Welcome to the first ever Frankenweenie Truth or Dare! All: YAY! Zinka17: I've never done one of these before, but I've read a bunch of them and I absolutely LOVE them! I've been wanting to do my own for awhile now, and since the Frankenweenie category didn't have any, I decided to go ahead and post my own. Edgar: No one cares about the boring reasons behind this! Just get on with it! Elsa: Edgar! *elbows him* Be nice! Edgar: Ow! Why'd you do that? Elsa: Because you're being rude! Edgar: Oh yeah? Well you're being ugly! Toshiaki: Ooh! Burn! Nassor: *facepalm* Bob: Well, this is turning out well. Zinka17: *sighs* Edgar, if you weren't my favorite character, I'd slap you so hard! Edgar: I'd like to see you try! Zinka17: *starts to hit him but then stops* Okay, everyone just be nice to each other now! I'm trying to explain the rules to the readers! Elsa: Sorry. Zinka17: You are forgiven Elsa. Anyway, sorry about that readers. So you probably already know how to do these Truth or Dare games, but in case you don't, you just send in truths and/or dares for the characters and watch the chaos that happens! Edgar: I LOVE chaos! Victor: We all know that Edgar. Edgar: No one asked you! Zinka17: HUSH! So as I was saying, you send in truths, dares, or even just comments, like if you wanna talk to a character or something. I may not use every single truth and dare, but I'm likely to use most of them. Just don't submit anything too inappropriate. This is rated T, so keep it PG-13 please. :) Edgar: So, what exactly can they NOT dare us to do? Zinka17: I can't really think of any specific thing right now. Once they send in the reviews, I'll decide whether they're appropriate or not. Elsa: Sounds like fun! Zinka17: Yeah, I'm super excited to be doing this! I'll try to update at least once a week, but I can't always promise that. Part of it will depend on you guys, the readers. I don't wanna have any super short chapters, so I need enough people to be interested in this story. You can submit as many truths and dares as you want per chapter. Just try not to overwhelm me with TOO many at once. Edgar: Are we almost done with this stupid intro? Zinka17: YES! Now shut up! Elsa: Seriously Edgar, quit being a brat. Edgar: I'm not being a- Zinka17: Here are the characters you can submit truths and dares for... Victor Elsa Edgar Bob Toshiaki Nassor Weird Girl Zinka17: I may add more characters later if anyone really wants me to, but I think most of us are mainly interested in the kids. And the animals can't talk so... Edgar: But you're the one writing this so you can make whatever you want happen. Zinka17: True... Well anyway that pretty much sums it up for this chapter. I'll start writing the next one as soon as I get some reviews. :) Edgar: Hurry up and start submitting your truths and dares everyone! I'm ready to get this party started! Zinka17: *rolls eyes* Well thanks for reading and we'll see you next chapter! All: Bye![Chapter 2] Zinka17: Hello everyone, and welcome to the first official chapter of Truth or Dare: Frankenweenie Style! Edgar: Finally! We had to wait forever! Zinka17: Ignoring him... Anyway, the first truths are from Dino64. Elsa: What are your real feelings for Victor? Elsa & Victor: *blushing deep red* Edgar: *smiles and rubs hands together eagerly* Ooh, this is already getting good! Elsa: Uh w-well, Victor and I are really great friends. Victor: Yeah, and we're just- Zinka17: Victor, this question is for Elsa, so you be quiet! Edgar: Go ahead Elsa. Tell everyone how you love Victor! Elsa: I don't love him! We're just really close friends! Edgar: Sure you are. *smirks* Zinka17: Next question! Toshiaki: Why are you and Victor enemies? Toshiaki: Well, we actually friends now, but I used to be his enemy because I jealous of him. He way smarter than me and he always win science fair at school. Zinka17: Wow Toshi, it takes courage to admit that you're jealous of someone! I'm proud of you. Toshiaki: Did you just call me Toshi? Nassor: Why are you so serious? Edgar: Yeah, why are you so serious? Zinka17: Edgar, we don't need an echo! Nassor: I wasn't always serious. I used to be cheerful and friendly, but after Colossus died I became depressed. He was my best friend and I loved him so much. *sniffs* And I was so happy when I brought him back to life. I thought we would be together again, but then he got stepped on by Shelley! *cries* Zinka17: Aw, don't cry Nassor! *hugs him* Edgar: It's all your fault Toshiaki! Toshiaki: How it my fault? Edgar: If you had been more careful and moved that Miracle Grow, Shelley wouldn't have become so huge and she wouldn't have killed Colossus! Toshiaki: Okay first of all, Shelley a boy, not girl! And second, I didn't know that stupid Miracle Grow there right next to him! Edgar: Haha Shelley is a girl name! Toshiaki: No it can be boy name too! It because he had shell on his back! Zinka17: Shut up both of you! None of us want to hear arguing right now! And Edgar, stop blaming Toshiaki! It wasn't his fault. Toshiaki: *points to Edgar* Ha! In your face! Zinka17: Toshiaki, shut it. *rubs Nassor's back* Are you okay now Nassor? Nassor: *sniffles* Yeah, I'm good now. *pulls away* Zinka17: Alright, the next question is from Saphirabrightscale. Weird Girl: What's your real name? Weird Girl: Harriet. Edgar: *goofy smile* That's a really pretty name! Weird Girl: *looks down shyly* Thank you. Zinka17: *mumbles* Someone has a crush. Edgar: What did you say? Zinka17: Nothing! Edgar: Hm... Zinka17: Okay the next one is from my friend smurfsandharrypotterrock12, and it's the first dare! Edgar: Alright! Finally a dare! Zinka17: *laughs* Yeah, and it's for you Edgar! Edgar: *smiles excitedly* Really? What is it? Edgar: I dare you to kiss Elsa. Elsa, Edgar, Victor & Weird Girl: WHAT?! Edgar: No way! I am NOT kissing her! Elsa: Yeah, and I'm not kissing him either! Zinka17: Sorry, but you have to. It's what the dare says. Edgar: Well can't you say this one is too inappropriate? Elsa: Yes! Please! Zinka17: Nope! Now get smooching! *pushes them together* Elsa: Oh alright! Let's just get it over with! *kisses Edgar on the lips for 3 seconds* Victor & Weird Girl: *eyes twitch* Elsa: YUCK! Edgar: I think I'm gonna be sick! Zinka17: Oh come on now. I'm sure it wasn't that bad! Edgar: It was! I'm gonna brush my teeth 10 times a day for a month! Elsa: Same here! And now I'll probably have nightmares for a year! Zinka17: You guys are overreacting. Victor: *clenches fists and mutters angrily* Zinka17: What's wrong Victor? Victor: Nothing! Toshiaki: *whispers in my ear* I think he jealous 'cause Elsa kiss Edgar. Zinka17: Ah, so that must be why Weird Girl is acting mad too... *points to Weird Girl* Weird Girl: *frowning and growling* Zinka17: Okay then... Moving on! The next one is from Guest. When was the last time you peed yourself? Zinka17: They didn't ask any specific person, so I'll just have Edgar answer it. Edgar: What? Why me?! First you make me kiss Elsa- Elsa: Ugh, don't bring it up! Edgar: And now you're gonna make me answer this? Zinka17: Yeah! Edgar: But why? There are 6 other people in here to choose from. Zinka17: Because you keep being a brat! Now answer the question! Edgar: *mumbles* A couple weeks ago. Bob: We can't hear you! Edgar: I said a couple weeks ago! Zinka17: What exactly happened? Edgar: Do I really have to share that? All: YES! Edgar: Fine! I was walking home from school when all of a sudden I had to pee really bad. I was too far away from the school and too far away from my house, so I walked faster. I finally got to my house 7 minutes later, but as soon as I got to the front door it was too late. I had already peed in my pants. All: *laughing hysterically* Edgar: *blushes* Okay it's not that funny! Nassor: It's hilarious! Zinka17: It's good to see you happy again Nassor! Nassor: Yeah, it feels good too. Zinka17: The next dare was requested from both atomiclollipopsand Dellie. Nassor: I dare you to kiss Toshiaki. Nassor & Toshiaki: *instantly stop laughing* Toshiaki: You joking, right? Zinka17: No. That's what the dare says. Toshiaki: I not kissing anyone, especially a guy! Nassor: Yes, this is outrageous! I'm not gay! Zinka17: You don't have to be gay to do a stupid dare! Now just do it! Toshiaki: Man, I did not sign up for this crap. Edgar: Come on Nassor, kiss your boyfriend! Nassor: *blushes* He is NOT my boyfriend! *looks at me* Can I just kiss him on the cheek? Zinka17: Sure. The dare didn't specify how you had to kiss him. Nassor: Oh thank God! *gives Toshiaki a quick peck on the cheek* Toshiaki: Ew! *wipes face off with hand* Nassor: *wipes mouth off* Believe me, I didn't enjoy it anymore than you did. Zinka17: Next up is Pumpkinpie13. Victor: What's the worst thing you've done that your parents don't know about? Victor: *starts calming down* Well, one time I stole a candy bar. Or at least attempted to. Zinka17: You , steal something? That's hard to believe. You're always such a good kid. Victor: I didn't want to! Edgar made me! Edgar: That's a lie! I didn't make him! I just kept bugging him about it. He didn't have to listen to me. Zinka17: Why don't you tell us the whole story Victor? Victor: Okay. So a few months ago Edgar and I went to Walmart to get some supplies for a school project. When we were in line at the checkout... ~Flashback~ Edgar: *whispers* Hey Victor, I dare you to steal a candy bar! Victor: Are you crazy? No way! I'd never steal anything! Edgar: Why? You afraid you'll get caught? Victor: Yes, and it's wrong. My parents raised me to be a good kid, and I plan to stay that way. Edgar: Aw come on! Don't listen to your parents all the time! They can't control you forever! One day you're gonna grow up and you don't want them telling you how to live, do you? Victor: Well, no, but- Edgar: Just take a candy bar! It's only one! Victor: *sighs* If you want one so bad I'll just buy it for you. Edgar: No! The whole point of this is to teach you how to be rebellious! You'll never grow up if you're always a perfect angel. Victor: Oh fine! If it'll get you to shut up! But I'm never doing anything like this again! *grabs candy bar and sticks it in his pocket* Edgar: It's our turn to put our stuff on the conveyor belt now. Victor: Okay. *puts items on conveyor belt* ~End of Flashback~ Victor: And like an idiot, I left the candy bar sticking out of my pocket, so when we started walking out the door the alarm went off and two security guards saw me. Edgar: Yeah, you should have seen it! It was so funny! Victor was laughing all nervously and then said the stupidest thing! \"Oh, I don't know how that got there!\" The guards snatched the candy bar away and then pushed Victor out the door. Victor: I was lucky they didn't call my parents, otherwise I would've been busted! Zinka17: Well, that was an interesting story. Next dare! Toshiaki: I dare you to start dancing to Gangnam Style in the middle of class. Toshiaki: What? But I don't even know that dance! Zinka17: Well then you better learn it! Since they requested that you do it in class, we'll have to wait until you have school again, then we'll record it happening and we'll all watch the video next chapter. :) Toshiaki: Well at least I have some time to learn it. Zinka17: Yeah, but not long. After this chapter is over, we'll teach you how to do it. Toshiaki: Whatever. Zinka17: Next ones are from ninaspringfield1134. Toshiaki & Nassor: Who do you like? Nassor: *suspiciously* Why did she ask both of us that question at the same time? Toshiaki: Yeah... Zinka17: *trying to hold back laughter* Um, I think what she was really asking is if you two like each other! Toshiaki & Nassor: NO! Zinka17: Well then who do you like? Toshiaki: I don't like anyone right now! No cute or pretty girls. Zinka17, Elsa & Weird Girl: *crossing arms* Humph! Toshiaki: *laughing nervously* No offense to you three! Zinka17: *walks towards Nassor so that he backs up against the wall* So, what about you Nassor? *smiling* Who do you like? Nassor: *blushing* Uh... Zinka17: Is it anyone in this room? Huh? Nassor: Well, I... Edgar: Oh c'mon Nassor! We all know you like Zinka! Zinka17: *smiling* Really? HE DOES?! *puts hands on Nassor's shoulder and shakes him gently* Is it true Nassor? Nassor: Uuhhh... *faints* Zinka17: Well, I guess he'll just have to tell us later. So wait are you serious Edgar? Does he really like me? Edgar: Yeah, he has a bunch of pictures of you in his room and he's always daydreaming about you in class and drawing pictures of you! Victor: Yeah he's been in love with you for quite a while now! Zinka17: *smiling dreamily* I can't believe it! I've had a crush on him ever since I saw Frankenweenie! *sighs* I can't wait until he wakes up! Elsa: *clears throat* Um, the next truth or dare? Zinka17: Oh yeah! Sorry. Bob: I dare you to sit on a couch for a minute. Bob: Uh, okay? *sits on couch* Zinka17: What kind of dare is that?! Victor: Yeah really. Edgar: Well it's sure easy for him! All Bob ever does is sit on couches! Zinka17: *elbows Edgar* Hey! Be nice! He can't help it if he's a little, well, overweight. Edgar: A little? He looks like a giant pumpkin! Zinka17: *slaps Edgar* Shut up! Edgar: Ow! That really hurt you crazy b- Elsa: Edgar! Don't talk to Zinka like that! Zinka17: *glaring at Edgar* What were you about to call me Edgar? Edgar: I was going to call you a, a... *whispers* Shoot what else starts with the letter B? Zinka17: What was that? Edgar: Nothing! I was just going to call you a butterfly! Yeah! Victor: Seriously Edgar, that's the best you could come up with? Edgar: *shrugs* Zinka17: *sighs* Whatever. I know what you were really gonna call me, but I'll let it go. For now. Edgar: Uh oh... Zinka17: Oh hey, it's been a minute! Bob can get off the couch now. Bob: Aw, but it's so comfy! Edgar: I'm sure it is fatty. Zinka17: EDGAR! Edgar: What? Zinka17: The last dare is from The Disney Dreamer. Victor: I dare you to kiss Elsa on the lips. Victor: *smiling* R-really? That's the dare? Zinka17: Yep. Victor: YES! Thank you The Disney Dreamer! *pulls Elsa over and kisses her* Elsa: *blushing but enjoying the kiss just as much as Victor* Edgar: Yuck! Zinka17: Hey, at least you're not kissing her again. Edgar: Yeah, but it's still nasty! I hate watching people kiss. Zinka17: Yeah, I do too. I'm breaking them up now! *pulls Victor and Elsa away from each other* Victor: Aw. Elsa: *smiles* Hey, you're a good kisser Victor. Victor: *blushing like mad* Uh, t-thank you Elsa. Hehe. Zinka17: Well that's it for this chapter! Keep on sending in truths and dares! All: Bye![Chapter 3] Zinka17: Welcome back everyone! We have a lot of great truths and dares, but before we start getting to those, we have a video we'd like to show you. Toshiaki: No! Please don't show! It so embarrassing! Zinka17: I have to show it. I already promised I would last chapter. Toshiaki: Then go back and rewrite it! Zinka17: That wouldn't be fair to the people who already read it. Now just cooperate Toshi. It's not that bad. Toshiaki: Why you keep calling me Toshi? Zinka17: Okay let's get the projector pulled down and upload this video to the computer. Edgar: I can't wait to watch this again! Toshiaki: *crosses arms* I can. Zinka17: Almost ready... Toshiaki: Just shoot me now. Zinka17: It's ready! Edgar: Yes! Zinka17: Everything in italics is the video. *hits play on the video* Mr. Rzykruski: Now class, today we will be learning about rock formations. When lava... Edgar: *whispers* You ready Toshiaki? Toshiaki: No. Edgar: Good! Turn the song on and get dancing! Toshiaki: *sighs* I going to be in so much trouble! *hits play on iPod* *Gangnam Style plays loudly* Mr. Rzykruski: Who on Earth turned on that blasted music?! Toshiaki: *gets out of seat and starts dancing* Students: *laughing* Mr. Rzykruski: Mr. Toshiaki! Turn off that horrid music and sit down right now! Toshiaki: *ignores him and keeps dancing* Mr. Rzykruski: Alright, I'm calling the principal! Toshiaki: *still dancing* No! Please don't! I don't even want to dance, but I have to! I got dared to! Mr. Rzykruski: That's ridiculous! You don't have to do some stupid dare when I'm telling you to stop! If you don't quit this instant, I'll call the principal and he'll personally escort you to his office! Toshiaki: I can't stop until song over! Mr. Rzykruski: *dialing number on phone* Toshiaki: No! Principal: *enters classroom* Alright, come with me young man! Edgar: *laughs* That was fast! Toshiaki: *turns off music and reluctantly follows principal* I hate you all! Zinka17: *turns video off* Toshiaki: I never want to see that video again! I still in trouble for that! I have to go to detention every day for 2 weeks! And it all your fault Pumpkinpie13! Zinka17: Oh Toshiaki, quit complaining! One day you'll look back at this and laugh about it! You can show it to your kids and grandkids! Toshiaki: I ignoring you! Zinka17: Fine with me. Our first dares are from X. Victor: I dare you to tell us what you really think of Elsa or else I'll send a hitman to shoot her... through the heart... twice! Victor: NO! Don't you EVER hurt Elsa or else I'll do the same to you! Zinka17: Don't worry Victor. I wouldn't allow any harm to come to any of you. Sometimes our reviewers can be a little... crazy. But you just have to deal with it. Now answer the question! Victor: Aw man... I-I love you Elsa! There I said it! *runs into another room and slams the door* Elsa: *speechless* Zinka17: Well, I'm glad he finally admitted it! Edgar: I knew it! I knew he liked her! Zinka17: Shut up! X has another dare, and it's very similar to this one. Elsa: I dare you to tell us how you really feel about Victor or else I will pay someone to kidnap Sparky. *evil smile* Oh yeah... I went there. Sparky: *whimpers and hides behind Zinka17* Zinka17: *pets Sparky* It's okay Sparky! No one will hurt you! Persephone: *nods, barks and growls angrily* Zinka17: Besides, Persephone will attack anyone who tries! Won't you girl? *pets Persephone* Persephone: Bark! Zinka17: Okay Elsa. Elsa: *nervously* Okay what? Zinka17: Answer the question! Elsa: I-I love you too Victor! Oh my God! What did I just say?! Victor: *opens door and peaks out* Do you really mean it Elsa? Elsa: *blushes* Yes. Victor: *smiles and pumps fist in the air* YES! SHE LOVES ME! *starts dancing around randomly* All: *staring at him* Victor: *blushes* Oh, uh... Hehe. Sorry about that. *sits down* Zinka17: *sighs* Love makes you do strange things. Okay we have a comment from Saphirabrightscale. Weird Girl: Thank you for answering my question. And Harriet is a nice name. Weird Girl: You're welcome! And thank you! Zinka17: Hey Bob? Bob: Yeah? Zinka17: Remember in the last chapter when you were dared to sit on the couch for a minute and we all thought that was a strange dare because it was so simple? Bob: Yeah... Zinka17: Well ninaspringfield said she forgot to add that you were supposed to do it upside down. Bob: Oh. Zinka17: So go ahead! Bob: But that's impossible! I can't stay balanced on my head! Zinka17: Well you have to try! Bob: Alright! *goes over to couch and attempts to sit upside down, but falls* See? I can't do it! Zinka17: Well then just keep trying and falling for a minute and we'll call it good! Bob: Fine! *tries again and falls* Zinka17: *frowns* Our next dare is from Guest. Elsa: What's wrong? Zinka17: Nothing! Elsa: Well what's the dare? Toshiaki: I dare you to kiss Nassor on the lips. Toshiaki: WHAT?! NOT AGAIN! Elsa: Oh... I see why you're upset Zinka. But you didn't seem to care the last time. Zinka17: That's because Nassor only had to kiss him on the cheek. But now... Nevermind! Just get it done Toshiaki! Toshiaki: Wait! I don't want to kiss him, and you don't want me to kiss him either, so why don't we just forget about dare? Zinka17: We can't. Now just do it! Elsa: Uh oh. Nassor's still unconscious. Toshiaki: Oh yeah! Well I guess I can't do dare! Zinka17: *smiles* I just got an idea! Elsa & Toshiaki: What? Zinka17: It's perfect! I won't be jealous and Nassor will wake up! Hopefully... Toshiaki: What you talking about? Zinka17: I'll kiss him first to wake him up, then once he's awake you can still kiss him. Toshiaki: No! I don't want to kiss him! This plan no good for me! Only you! Elsa: Seems like a good plan. Let's try it out! Zinka17: Okay! *goes over to Nassor and kisses him on the lips* Nassor: *eyes flutter open, then close, then open wide* Zinka17: *stops kissing him* You're awake! Nassor: *smiles* Y-you kissed me! Zinka17: Yeah. I did it to wake you up because Toshiaki has to kiss you. Nassor: *smile fades* What? Again? But I don't want him to kiss me! Zinka17: Well last time it was only on the cheek, but now he has to kiss you on the lips. That's why I kissed you first so I wouldn't be jealous! *covers mouth with hands* Why did I just say that? Nassor: You mean... you like me? Zinka17: Yes but we don't have time to talk about it right now! Toshiaki, hurry up and kiss him so we can get on with the rest of the truths and dares! Toshiaki: *frowns and stomps over to Nassor* Nassor: Oh why? Toshiaki: I don't like it either! *kisses Nassor on the lips for one second* There it over! *wipes mouth off* Nassor: *runs over to sink and brushes teeth* Edgar: Hey! Where'd that sink come from all of a sudden? It wasn't there when I had to kiss Elsa! Zinka17: In random stories like these, strange things happen. I can do things with magic, like transport us places or make things appear or disappear. However, I didn't make that sink appear, so I have no idea how it got here. Toshiaki: I next in line to brush my teeth! *takes a toothbrush out of his pocket* Zinka17: Oh boy. Another one! Edgar: Another what? Zinka17: Some dude named Spencer dares Nassor to kiss Toshiaki on the lips- Nassor & Toshiaki: NO! Zinka17: I wasn't finished yet! As I was going to say before I was so rudely interrupted, I won't make them do it again since they just did. Next person is Jason. Edgar: I dare you to kiss Weird Girl on the cheek. Edgar: Aw, why can't I kiss her on the lips? Zinka17: Hey, at least you get to kiss her at all. Edgar: Yeah, you're right. But someone better dare me to kiss her on the lips next chapter! Weird Girl: I agree. Edgar: *smiles goofily and kisses Weird Girl's cheek* Zinka17: Aw, aren't they adorable? Toshiaki: No. Kissing make me sick! Zinka17: Toshiaki, someday you'll find a girl who you really like and then you won't think kissing is gross. Toshiaki: No way! I could never like anyone! Zinka17: *sighs* Boys. Okay we have a comment from my friend smurfsandharrypotterrock12. THANK YOU FOR USING MY DARE! Zinka17: No problem! It was funny to watch. Edgar: Wait a minute... Isn't she the one who made me and Elsa kiss? Zinka17: Yep. Edgar: And she's your friend? I'M GONNA KILL HER! Zinka17: *grabs Edgar* Hey! No violence! You're not allowed to hurt our reviewers! They make this story possible! Edgar: *calms down* Okay, I'll spare her this time, but if she makes me do anything else I don't like... Zinka17: Ignore his threats. He can't do anything to hurt anyone. Okay our next dares are from Dino64. *laughs* Edgar, I think you may just hate this person a little more than smurfsandharrypotterrock12. Edgar: Why? Zinka17: Because of their dares! Edgar: What are they?! Edgar: I dare you to lick Bob's armpits. Edgar: Hell no! I'm not doing that! Toshiaki: Ooh! He said H-E double hockey sticks! Zinka17: *laughs* It's okay. Mild cuss words like hell and damn are fine. Really, since this is rated T, any cuss word can be allowed, but I don't want to offend any of our readers, so just keep the language PG. And yes you will do it Edgar! Edgar: But that's disgusting! Zinka17: I agree, but you were dared to, so get going! Edgar: Aw man I really will throw up after this! *walks over to Bob who is successfully sitting upside down* Victor: Whoa! How long have you been like that Bob? Bob: A few minutes now. Zinka17: You only had to do it for a minute you know. Bob: I know, but it's actually really comfortable! I didn't think I could do it but I was wrong! Edgar: Yeah yeah just get down so I can get this stupid dare done! Bob: I'm sorry you have to do this Edgar. *lifts armpit up to reveal a huge wet spot* Edgar: *gags* Oh God! Your armpit is drenched in sweat! Bob: *laughs nervously* Uh, yeah. Sorry. Edgar: Okay I'm gonna do it and get it over with! *licks Bob's armpit* Oh man... I'm gonna- Zinka17: Don't throw up on the floor! *waves hand above the floor and a trashcan appears* Edgar: *runs over to trashcan and throws up in it* Zinka17: Poor Edgar. He's sick now and this next dare is really gonna make him mad. Edgar: *looks up while holding onto the trashcan* Why? What is it? Weird Girl: I dare you to kiss Victor on the lips. Edgar: NO! Victor: *sighs angrily* Okay. *kisses Weird Girl* Elsa: I'm gonna find that Dino64 and rip their- Zinka17: Elsa! Elsa: Hehe. Just kidding! Zinka17: Besides, you got to kiss him already. Elsa: Yeah you're right. *sighs dreamily* And it was great! It was the happiest moment of my life! Victor: Mine too. Elsa: Oh! You're done. Victor: Yeah... Edgar: After I brush my teeth I'm gonna go to Dino64's house and- Zinka17: *glares at Edgar* Edgar: And give them a big hug! Hehe. Zinka17: Could you all stop threatening our reviewers? You all agreed to do this Truth or Dare game. You signed contracts! Edgar: Yeah well I wish I hadn't! I didn't know people could be so cruel! *brushes teeth* Zinka17: Well get used to it. I'm sure a lot more people are gonna send in dares that you won't like. Next up is Toshiaki's favorite person, Pumpkinpie13. Toshiaki: Oh yeah I don't like her. She made me dance Gangnam Style! Elsa: How did you come up with your hairstyle? (Just curious.) Elsa: I've had this hairstyle ever since my hair was long enough to be put up. I don't really know why I chose it. I guess I just wanted something that was different from everybody else. Once I tried it, I loved it, and I've kept it ever since then. Bob: I dare you to wear skinny jeans. (Yes, I know. I'm evil. xD) Bob: You sure are! I can't fit into skinny jeans! I'll rip them! Zinka17: Well you gotta try to put them on. Here. *tosses Bob a pair of brand new skinny jeans* Go in the other room to change and then come back so we can see. Bob: Oh alright. *goes into the other room* A few minutes later... Bob: *comes out walking with legs straight out* Oh. My. GOD! These are so painful to walk in! Please let me take them off! Zinka17: Uh, it looks like you ripped them in the back. Bob: I know! I told you that would happen! Zinka17: *laughs* Okay you can take them off now! Bob: *walks quickly back into the other room* Zinka17: Poor Bob. Our next reviewer is finalefighter6. Victor: Would you do anything for Elsa? Victor: Of course I would! I love her! *blushes* Elsa: Aw, that's so sweet Victor! I love you too! *hugs Victor* Zinka17: They're just so freakin' cute! Edgar: *makes gagging noise* Zinka17: Oh shut up Edgar. *reads the next dare* *gasps* No! Edgar: What? Zinka17: I don't want Edgar to do that! Edgar: You don't want me to do what? Edgar: I dare you to punch Nassor in the face. :3 Nassor: What?! Zinka17: And they even put some kind of smiley face afterwards! How mean! Edgar: I don't mind this dare! Not that I have anything against you Nassor it's just, well, now I get to take my anger out on someone! Nassor: But- Edgar: Don't worry. It won't hurt that much. Well actually I don't know. *laughs and raises fist up* Zinka17: *grabs Edgar's hand* Wait! Maybe I should say this dare is too violent. Edgar: No! It's fine! It's just a punch in the face! It's not that bad! Nassor: I agree with Zinka! Please don't let him punch me! Zinka17: Oh dear I don't know what to do! *paces around and talks quietly to self* Hm, if I let Edgar punch him I'll feel really guilty and bad for poor Nassor. But it'll also be a great excuse to kiss him again! Yes! It's perfect! *normal voice* Okay Edgar, you can punch him. Edgar: Yes! Nassor: What? But I thought you loved me Zinka! Zinka17: I do! That's why I'm letting him punch you! Nassor: But that doesn't make any sense! Zinka17: You'll understand in a minute! Now go ahead Edgar. Edgar: *punches Nassor really hard in the face* Nassor: OW! *holds face* Ow that really hurt. Zinka17: *runs over to Nassor and kisses him on the cheek where Edgar punched him* Nassor: Thanks for the kiss, but I'm still mad that you let him punch me! Zinka17: I did it because I thought it would be a great excuse to give you a kiss! Since you're hurt, it'll make you feel better. Nassor: Well you could have given me a kiss anyway without him punching me! Then I would have felt even better! Zinka17: Yeah... Oh well next comment is from The Disney Dreamer. Victor, you are so very welcome. ;) Victor: Uh... what? Zinka17: Don't you remember? She's the one who dared you to kiss Elsa! Victor: Oh yeah! Of course! Zinka17: We now have a very long and detailed comment from Registered2Comment. *instafave* I love this kind of random hilarity and fun with characters. Zinka17: I do too! That's why I decided to do this. All the other Truth or Dares I've read have been very successful, and now I see that mine is too! I've gotten a ton of reviews already! Huzzah for Victor/Elsa and Weird Girl/Edgar! X3 Victor, Elsa, Weird Girl & Edgar: *blush* Awesome, awesome, awesome. So much smooching going on! *rofl* Edgar's bein' a right impertinent little pain in the rear... Edgar: Hey! Zinka17: It's true. Edgar: It is not! LOL at his pants-peeing story... Of course it was recent for him, ahaha. And he's such a bad influence on poor wise Victor. xD Edgar: Alright enough teasing me about my accident! Victor: Well Edgar you had it coming. You keep getting on everyones' nerves. Edgar: But I- *pouts and shuts up* Everyone's in-character, though, which is great to see. Makes it a lot more fun. And why does WG look so much like a Harriet? I've seen several different ideas for what her name could be, and some seemed quite fitting, but I think Harriet trumps them all... think I'll adopt that as headcanon. Zinka17: Glad you like the name! I thought for a long time on a name with no luck, so I looked up a list of female names online and Harriet was the first thing that caught my eye, so I went with it. The only other name I've heard used for her was Marie, but that didn't quite sound like her to me. Lmao at Toshiaki's Gangnam Style learnings as they teach him how to do it. Zinka17: Oh yeah we had a lot of fun with that! We had Toshi watch the music video 7 times before he could finally do the dance. Toshiaki: It was pure torture! And so embarrassing as they all sit there laughing at me! And Bob on the couch... oh, poor Bob! Zinka17: Haha, well as you saw in this chapter, that was actually a mistake. He was meant to be upside down while on the couch, which I thought was much more amusing. AND, someone else who loves Nassor? Excellent. OMG. He is too utterly adorable. *wants so much to hug him* Buuut, the poor thing's unconscious again...:'/.' Zinka17: Oh well he's awake now, so feel free to hug him! *snaps fingers and Registered2Comment is standing in the room* Registered2Comment: Whoa. That was cool! I didn't think I'd actually get to come here! Zinka17: Yep! You're the first reviewer to be here! Registered2Comment: *looks at Nassor* Oh my gosh! Is that really him standing over there? Zinka17: It sure is! Go ahead and hug him! Registered2Comment: *runs over to Nassor and hugs him really tightly* You are just so freaking adorable! Nassor: Help. Me! I can't breathe! Registered2Comment: *lets go* Whoops! Sorry. Hehe. I guess I just got a little carried away. I still can't believe I just saw you in person and hugged you! Zinka17: Yeah, he's pretty huggable huh? Well it was nice to meet you and I hope you come back here again sometime! Registered2Comment: I really enjoyed it! Thanks for bringing me here! Zinka17: No problem! *snaps fingers and Registered2Comment is gone* Okay next up is Guest again and they- Hm... I'm a little confused about their question. Edgar: What'd they say? Zinka17: These are their exact words. Since I don't know what they're asking I can't really re-word it. Oh oh please have a truth if they would GIGO Hotel Transylvania. Please. Zinka17: Maybe they're asking if you guys want to go to Hotel Transylvania. I don't know. Well Guest, if you can please be a little clearer next time that would be great. Just review again and hopefully by the next chapter we can have an answer for you. Okay they have another question. This time it's a truth for Elsa. Elsa: Do you like black veil brides? PS: They are awesome and super sexy. Elsa: Uh, sure, I guess. I never really thought about it before. Brides are always supposed to wear a white dress though. Zinka17: Could you guys who are reviewing anonymously as Guest please do me a favor and write a different name? 3 different reviews for this chapter have been left by Guest and I'm not sure if you're all different people or if you're the same person. If you're just one person and you want to keep the name, that's fine, but please put all of your truths and dares in the same review instead of posting multiple ones. It makes it easier for me when I'm writing this. Alright the next comment and dare is from SJK09. OMG I was reading Nassor's truth and right when I read \"serious\", (I was listening to G-Dragon- Crayon) and G-Dragon was like \"Why so serious?\" I was like O.O Zinka17: Okay... I've never heard of G-Dragon but what a funny coincidence! I dare Toshiaki and Nassor to kiss on the lips for at least ten seconds. Yes, I know it's cruel. MWAHAHAHA! Nassor: Oh come on not again! Why do so many people keep wanting us to kiss?! Zinka17: Well a lot of people like the Nassor/Toshiaki pairing. There are at least 3 stories about you guys being in a relationship. The only one I've read all the way through is 'Stop That' by GaaLee-girl-13. It's hilarious! I've read it twice! Nassor: You what?! You like me but yet you find stories like that amusing? Zinka17: *shrugs shoulders* Just start kissing! Toshiaki: *sighs* Now I going to have to brush my teeth AGAIN! *kisses Nassor for 10 seconds* Yuck! *runs over to sink and brushes teeth* Nassor: I'm right behind you! *gets out toothbrush* Zinka17: Next is SamApeace. Weird Girl: Why do you have big eyes? Weird Girl: I keep my eyes wide open all the time, so they look bigger than they really are. Everyone: What is your biggest, deepest, darkest secret? Zinka17: Ooh this should be interesting! Let's start with Bob. Bob: Okay... Well sometimes I watch rated R movies when my parents aren't home. Zinka17: What kind? Bob: Scary movies. Zinka17: Oh okay. It sucks. I'm 16 and I'm still not allowed to watch R rated movies, but most of my friends have been allowed to ever since they were little kids! Okay next is Toshiaki. Toshiaki: Sometimes I cuss at Mr. Rzykruski or the principal in Japanese, but I tell them I saying \"Nice day today.\" Zinka17: Haha that's really funny! Okay Elsa you're up. Elsa: Sometimes I wish my uncle would go away forever so I wouldn't have to see him anymore. He's so rude and grouchy! Zinka17: He is, but he loves you. You know that right? Elsa: Yeah, I guess. Zinka17: Edgar, you're next. Edgar: I steal money from my parents. Zinka17: You little brat! *laughs* Do you get away with it? Edgar: Yeah! I always tell them my little cousin steals it when he comes over and they believe me! They always yell at him and tell my aunt, and then she yells at him. He cries and says that he didn't steal it, so she spanks him. Zinka17: Edgar! That's hella mean! I can't believe you would be such a bully to your cousin! Edgar: Ah who cares he's just a little kid! Zinka17: How old is he? Edgar: 6. Zinka17: Well if I ever hear about you doing that again I'm gonna personally kick your ass and tell your aunt the truth. Edgar: Ah whatever. Zinka17: Okay next is Weird Girl. Weird Girl: I've always had a thing for strange guys. I guess it's because I'm very strange myself. That's why I like Edgar so much. Edgar: I don't know whether to be happy or insulted. Weird Girl: Oh no please don't take offense! I just meant because... well... Edgar: I'm just kidding! I know I'm weird. Zinka17: Nassor you're next. Nassor: I cried myself to sleep every night for 2 months after Colossus died. I even bought a stuffed hamster toy and slept with it. I was 11 and a half years old too. Edgar: *bursts out laughing* Zinka17: *glares at Edgar* Edgar: *stops laughing* Zinka17: Aw Nassor, I'm so sorry sweetie. *hugs him* I used to have 2 hamsters named Rosie and Sophia. I got them when I was in 4th grade and Rosie died at the end of 5th grade, and Sophia at the beginning of 6th grade. I've also had several other pets who died. The most recent was my guinea pig, Kevin. He was such a sweetheart. *smiles sadly* But I still have a female guinea pig named Penny, and two female cats named Beauty and Spot. Okay sorry about that long pet story I'm sure none of you guys cared about hearing. Elsa: Oh no it's fine! I'm really sorry about your pets. Zinka17: Oh well it's all in the past now. The last person to tell us their biggest secret is Victor. Victor: Well, this is kinda embarrassing and I hope you guys don't think I'm a creep, but I used to constantly stalk Elsa at school and even sometimes after school. I live right next to her so it was pretty easy. Elsa: Well, uh... I don't know what to say. Victor: *laughs nervously and rubs the back of his neck* I stopped doing it a year ago though! Elsa: *smiles and shakes head* Zinka17: The last reviewer for this chapter is iluvBrickMcArther, who was so kind as to leave me a comment on deviantART. By the way, in case you guys didn't know, I'm going to start drawing a bunch of scenes from this story and posting them on there! I've already started one of Elsa and Edgar kissing. I was hoping to have it posted a couple days ago but I keep having to start over because it's really hard and I keep messing up. I'll get it soon though and have the link to it posted in the next chapter of this story. But in the meantime you're free to check out my other artwork I have posted. My username is the same as on here. Really cute and funny! I can't wait for more! Toshiaki: I dare you to kiss Victor on the lips! But this is seriously hilarious! Toshiaki: Are you kidding me? Why I have to keep kissing guys! Victor: Yeah seriously. They must think you're gay. Zinka17: *laughing* Well whether you're gay or not get kissing! Victor: *frowns* Toshiaki: *kisses Victor on the lips* Now I have to brush my teeth for the third time! Victor: Gotta get my toothbrush too. Yuck! *wipes mouth off* Zinka17: Well this was a long chapter! Over 4,500 words! Thanks to you awesome reviewers, this story is extremely popular. Keep on sending in those truths and dares and we'll see you next chapter![Chapter 4] Zinka17: Sorry it's taken me so long to update! I'm working on several other stories too. Plus I'm drawing pictures for a lot of the dares from this and posting them to deviantART. I don't have any posted yet, but I finished drawing the first one so now I just have to edit it on my computer. I have a TON of pictures to draw for this story and I need to get caught up with all the new dares being submitted, so it'll probably be awhile before the next chapter is posted. But just keep checking deviantART for new drawings. Edgar: *sighs loudly in boredom and drums fingers across a table* Zinka17: *glares at Edgar* Okay first up is CityCat. A Frankenweenie-style Truth or Dare, is it? What an exciting idea to play around with Tim Burton's curious characters! I have a few ideas of my own, so I'll start with our favorite character... E: What are your parents like? (You know how everyone seems to have an adult in their life except for him?) Edgar: Why'd you call me E? Elsa's name starts with E too, so it could have been very confusing. Zinka17: Oh hush Edgar! She said 'he' so we obviously know she was talking about you. Now answer the question! Edgar: My parents are kinda strict. They yell at me a lot for goofing off and they never let me have any fun! Toshiaki: Are they hunchbacks like you? Edgar: No! Victor: Have you ever thought of reanimating anything else after Sparky? (Because why should his dog live while other kids must suffer their pets' deaths?) Victor: Well, I understand that other people are upset about their dead pets, but I think it would cause too much trouble if I brought every single pet back to life. Just look at what happened when Edgar, Bob, Nassor, Toshiaki and Weird Girl brought those animals back! They became evil and destroyed the city! Especially Shelley. Toshiaki: Hey! He can't help it he grow so big! Elsa: I dare you to dress like Katy Perry for a whole day. (Cotton candy blue wig and all!) Elsa: Um, okay. That's kind of an unusual request, but I like Katy Perry a lot so I don't mind. Zinka17: *is suddenly holding a Katy Perry outfit in her hands* Here you go Elsa! Just go into the back room and put it on, then come right back! Elsa: *takes clothes and eyes go wide* Uh, isn't this outfit a little... revealing? Zinka17: Oh come on Elsa! You just have to wear it for today. Besides, it'll be interesting to wear something different for a change. *whispers* And I think Victor will like it! Elsa: Oh alright. *goes into back room* A few minutes later... Elsa: *comes back out wearing a blue wig, cupcake bra, and blue jean short shorts* *blushes* I feel so exposed! Victor: *eyes go wide and tongue hangs out of mouth* Y-you look great Elsa! Elsa: *blushes even more* Thanks. I feel so weird though! Zinka17: I hope that outfit is okay CityCat. I just went with the first one I saw on Google Images that had a blue wig. I'm pretty sure that's the outfit used in California Gurls. Bob: I dare you to complete a marathon. (Save cancer patients and burn calories!) Bob: What?! But I hate running! Zinka17: You and me both. Bob: I literally can't run! I get so out of breath! Zinka17: Hey, at least it's for a good cause. *magically transports everyone to a marathon* Oh good we're just in time! Now go! *pushes Bob to the start line* Bob: Oh why did I ever agree to do this stupid Truth or Dare? Zinka17: And the rest of us can just relax and watch him suffer! Announcer: On your mark, get set, go! Bob: *starts running as fast as he can and breathes heavily* Zinka17: Yeah! Go Bob! A few hours later... Bob: *comes in 26th place, panting* Whew! I. Did. It! I'm. Finally. Done! Zinka17: Yeah and you did great! Bob: No. I didn't. I. Came. In. Last. Place! Zinka17: Well you did your best. Let's get back to the Truth or Dare room! *transports everyone back* Toshiaki: Given the opportunity, would you move back to your home country and why? Toshiaki: That kind of a hard decision. I miss Japan and my friends and family who live there, but I also have lot of friends here now too, so if I moved back, it would be kind of hard. I think I prefer to stay here. I always visit Japan once a year anyway. Nassor: I dare you to go to Disneyland and get the autographs of every princess in the park! Nassor: Are you kidding me? That'll be so embarrassing! Zinka17: It'll be hilarious! Let's go! Bob: Yay! Disneyland! Zinka17: We're not staying for rides though. We're just gonna let Nassor get the autographs of all the princesses. Bob: Aw. Zinka17: *transports everyone to Disneyland* Nassor: Alright let's just get this over with. I need a piece of paper. Zinka17: I made this just for you Nassor! *hands him a pink piece of paper in the shape of a heart with fancy white lacing around it* Nassor: No! I refuse to have them autograph this! This'll just make it worse! Zinka17: Quit complaining and get their autographs! You'll look back on this one day and laugh about it. Nassor: *clenches fists and snatches the paper* Zinka17: Look! *points to someone walking a ways off* There's Rapunzel! Hurry and get her autograph before she gets away! Nassor: *grumbles under his breath as he runs after Rapunzel* Wait! Stop! Rapunzel: *stops walking and turns around* Well hello there cutie! I didn't know you were coming here today! Zinka17: (A/N: Since this story has a lot of magic in it and the Frankenweenie characters are supposed to be real anyways, I decided that I might as well have all the princesses be the real ones too instead of people in costumes. My theory is that they don't live in Disneyland, but go there to visit sometimes. And since Frankenweenie is a Disney movie, I'm assuming all the princesses already know Nassor.) Nassor: *blushes* Uh, c-could you autograph this please? *holds up paper* Rapunzel: *puts a hand up to her mouth to stifle her giggling* Sure! *takes paper and pen* What for though? You already know me personally. Nassor: It was a dare. I have to get all of the princesses' autographs. Rapunzel: *smiles and hands back paper* Good luck then! It'll be hard finding everyone. But I did see Snow White just a few minutes ago. She was heading in that direction! *points to a castle a ways off* Nassor: Come on! Let's go! All: *follow him* A few hours later back in the Truth or Dare room... Nassor: Finally! I'm done! That took forever and it was so embarrassing! Zinka17: Well you got something accomplished that most people don't! (A/N: By the way, sorry if you were looking forward to all of the princesses' reactions, but it would take too long. There's Rapunzel, Snow White, Pocahontas, Belle, Cinderella, Tiana, Aurora, Jasmine, Ariel and Mulan. That's 10 princesses and this chapter is already extremely long.) Okay, CityCat still has a bit to say. The review portion of the review- I see you haven't updated in awhile. Are you planning to write out chapter 2 soon? Zinka17: Well as you know this is now actually chapter 3, but you said it was okay if I waited to add your review since I had already completed the 2nd chapter by the time you posted it. And yes, it takes me awhile to update as I said before, but I will try to update as often as I can. Your characterization is pretty spot-on if I do say so myself. Zinka17: Why thank you! I try my best to keep everyone in character, but I actually think I'm terrible at it! I've never really been good with that sort of thing. It's one of the things I don't like about my writing style. Love your interpretation of Toshiaki's dialect; it's just so fun to read out loud. Zinka17: Haha I enjoy writing it too. I wanted to make him sound like he does in the movie as much as possible, and I know English is his 2nd language, so I try to write his dialogue as accurately to that as I can. One question though: Why is Edgar so obnoxious and rude? It's clear he's an attention-addict, but I always thought he'd be the more socially awkward type (like the original Igor from Young Frankenstein). Zinka17: Yeah... Sorry about that. Like I said it's kinda hard for me to keep everyone completely in character 100% of the time. And for some reason I just always thought of Edgar as being kind of rude and annoying. I guess it was because of the way he acted in the movie. Like when he practically told , not asked Victor to be his science partner. That aside, please keep writing and I'm looking forward to later installments of Frankenweenie Truth-or-Dare! With love, encouragement, and gourmet peppermint bark, -CityCat Zinka17: Thanks! I love peppermint! *grabs a piece to eat* Edgar: Can I have some? Zinka17: NO! MY PEPPERMINT! Nassor: Can I have some? Zinka17: Of course you can sweetie! *hands him a piece* Edgar: Aw come on! Just because you like him he gets peppermint? Zinka17: No... *hands peppermint to everyone except Edgar* It's just that you're being extremely annoying. Edgar: But- Zinka17: I'm just kidding! Here. *hands peppermint to Edgar* Edgar: *smiles toothy grin and eyes get wide* Peppermint! It's so minty! Zinka17: *laughs* That it is Edgar. That it is. Next up is SamApeace. I had no idea that Victor liked looking and following Elsa. That's one good deep dark secret. Victor: *slinks down in seat and covers face with a big book* Elsa: *smiles* It's okay Victor. I think it's really cute that you did that. Victor: *laughs nervously* Really? Elsa: *nods* And Toshiaki teach me how to say some cussing words in Japanese. I know how to say some in Spanish and Chinese. Toshiaki: Uh, well I don't think that very appropriate for this story. But you can go to Google Translate. It show you the Japanese characters and English pronunciation. Zinka17: Haha I know some in Spanish too. Only because my Spanish teacher sort of taught it to us on accident. Next we have finalefighter6. I am back and this is a truth towards everyone. What's your favorite movie? Zinka17: To make it easy, I'll just have you all go in the order of where you're sitting, starting with Elsa. Elsa: I like Coraline. She's different like me, and I like movies that are kind of strange. Victor: Marley & Me. I know it's kinda sad, but it's funny too. And of course I love dogs. *pets Sparky behind the ears* Sparky: Bark! *wags tail happily* Edgar: Igor is my favorite for obvious reasons. Weird Girl: Cinderella. I've always loved movies about princesses and she's my favorite one! Zinka17: And you got to meet her today too! Toshiaki: I like Godzilla. He so cool! Nassor: The Avengers is the best in my opinion. Zinka17: *smirks* Yes, I could tell by your Thor underwear! Nassor: *gasps and pulls pants up* Bob: I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. How I wish I could go there! Edgar: I can see why. Zinka17: *elbows Edgar* And in case anyone wants to know, my favorite is Men in Black 3. But Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is a close 2nd. Persephone: Bark! Zinka17: You're right Persephone! Why should you and Sparky be left out? After all, I can understand you, so I'll just translate for everyone. Victor: Wait, why can't Elsa and I understand our own dogs, but you can? Zinka17: I have power that no one else has. I'm the author after all. Okay Sparky, what's your favorite movie? By the way, their translation, which is italicized, just sounds like barking to everyone else. Sparky: 101 Dalmatians. Zinka17: And you Persephone? Persephone: Lady and the Tramp. Zinka17: How fitting! You and Sparky have a dare that has to do with Lady and the Tramp later on. Sparky & Persephone: What is it? Zinka17: You'll just have to wait and see! Next up is ninaspringfield1134. Sorry to cause you pain Bob. I just love sitting upside down with the blood rushing to your head... Could you hear the blood rushing to your head? *demonic voice* It's fun to use that voice. *normal voice* Bob: *backs up with eyes widened in fear* She's scaring me! Zinka17: She's just messing with you Bob. Next is X. I'm back! I hope Victor and Elsa enjoyed their little dares. *smiles* Ah, young love... How adorable... *smile fades*... How overrated... *frowns*... HOW SICKENING. I have a few dares! Victor: (Elsa can't hear the dare) Elsa: What?! Why?! Zinka17: Just go in the other room until I call you back out Elsa. Elsa: *frowns and walks away* Victor: Break up with Elsa. *evil smile* Or else I will have someone kidnap her. Victor: NO! HOW COULD YOU?! YOU'RE EVIL! Zinka17: Yeah, I'm starting to agree with Victor. Sorry Victor, but you have to do it. Victor: *tears in eyes* But it's not fair! She won't know that I don't mean it! She'll hate me forever! Zinka17: *smiles* Wait a minute... You're not technically dating Elsa in the first place, so you can't break up with her. All you said was that you loved her, but you never once said she was your girlfriend. There. Problem solved. Victor: Oh my gosh thank you Zinka! You're the best! *hugs Zinka really tightly* Zinka17: Victor! I like. To breathe! Victor: Sorry! *lets go* Zinka17: I'll go get Elsa now. *goes into the other room and comes back with Elsa* Elsa: So what was the dare? Zinka17: We can't tell you. Sorry. Elsa: Aw man. Zinka17: Don't worry it's nothing that affects you. Elsa: I guess that's okay then. Edgar: I dare you to NOT kiss Weird Girl for an entire chapter. Edgar: NO! Oh the horror! Zinka17: It's just one chapter. You'll live. Edgar: No I won't! Zinka17: Drama queen. Nassor: Kiss Weird Girl. Nassor: *sighs* If I have to. *kisses Weird Girl* Edgar: *sees red* Zinka17: Okay next is... Oh wait a minute. We have a little message from X. P.S. Failure to complete the dares I give will result in an even worse dare in the next chapter! Victor: *gasps* Zinka17: Don't worry Victor. You couldn't have done the dare because as I already explained, it was impossible. Just relax. Victor: *takes a deep breathe and calms down* Zinka17: Next is a comment from SJK09. Thanks for using my dare. Ha, they probably hate me now. x) Nassor & Toshiaki: YES WE DO! Zinka17: Hey! It's not nice to say you hate the reviewers. You can have a strong dislike for them though, but hate is just too cruel. Next reviewer is iluvBrickMcArther. OMG! Thank you for using my dare! Ok. Truth for Toshiaki... Why do you give people such evil looks all the time? (Toshi, please don't punch me for the last dare. You are really adorable and I wish I could hug you...) Toshiaki: Why I give people evil look? I don't really know. It just way I naturally look. I so used to it I don't even realize I doing it. Sorry if I creep you out. And about the dare... I did not like kissing Victor, but since you say I adorable I guess it okay. Zinka17: Wish granted iluvBrickMcArther! *transports her to the room* iluvBrickMcArther: *gasps* TOSHI! *runs over and hugs him tightly* Toshiaki: AH! SOMEONE. HELP. ME! iluvBrickMcArther: *lets go* I'm sorry if I hurt you, but I can't help it! You're just too cute! Toshiaki: *takes deep breath* It okay. I forgive you. *narrows eyes* As long as you don't make me do more dares I don't like. iluvBrickMcArther: Hehe. I'm not making any promises... Zinka17: Don't mind him. You can submit whatever kind of dare you like! As long as it's appropriate. iluvBrickMcArther: I'll keep that in mind. Bye Toshi! Toshiaki: Why everyone keep calling me that? Zinka17: It's your new nickname now. Well thank you for joining us today iluvBrickMcArther. I hope you come here again sometime. iluvBrickMcArther: Bye everyone! *in quieter voice* Bye Toshiaki! Toshiaki: *grabs my arm* I'm scared! Zinka17: *laughs and snaps fingers making iluvBrickMcArtherdisappear* Don't worry Toshiaki. I think she probably likes Nassor more anyway. On deviantART her username is nassorluver. She even made a group for him, which I joined of course. Nassor: *blank stare* I hope she doesn't come here too often then... Zinka17: Don't worry Nassor. She's nice! Nassor: Yes, but what if she tries to hug me next? Zinka17: Oh she has something else to say. And Zinka you are awesome! :) Zinka17: Aw, thank you! I really am touched. Our next reviewer is Love Master. *reads dare* Oh my... Edgar: What is it? Zinka17: It's just that the dare is a little... disturbing. Edgar: Well who's it for? Zinka17: Nassor. Nassor: Let me see! *reads dare and blushes as eyes go wide* Edgar: What is it? Nassor: I dare you to kiss Zinka on the neck for 5 minutes. Since you and Zinka been kissing a lot, I thought you needed some kissing tips. *smirks* Edgar: *bursts out laughing* Oh this'll be good! I'm getting a camera! Zinka17 & Nassor: NO! Edgar: Okay! Geez, calm down! Zinka17: Just do it and get it over with Nassor. Nassor: *hesitantly walks over to Zinka* 5 minutes later... Edgar: *laughing hysterically* Oh man that was so funny! Zinka17 & Nassor: *blushing deep red* NO IT WASN'T! Edgar: I took a picture! *shows Victor and Bob* Victor & Bob: *trying to stifle their laughing* Zinka17: Give me that camera! *snatches camera, throws it on the ground and stomps on it hard several times* There! Now it's broken. Edgar: That was my brand new digital camera! My parents are gonna kill me! Zinka17: Don't worry I'll just make a new one appear. *makes new digital camera appear out of thin air* Edgar: Thanks. *frowns* I guess. Zinka17: Next is a comment from lightsisawesome90. Elsa: Black Veil Brides is a guy band. Elsa: Oops! Sorry, but I've never heard of them before. I feel like a complete idiot now. Zinka17: Don't feel bad Elsa. I've never heard of them either. I would've said the same thing. Okay next is Saphirabrightscale. I feel so sorry for Toshiaki and Nassor. Toshiaki & Nassor: Thank you! But I have a question for Elsa: Have you ever thought of yourself as a cat person? Elsa: I'm more of a dog person, but I still like cats a lot. Persephone: If she ever got a cat I would chase it! Zinka17: Haha, well I am a cat person, so I hope you don't ever try to chase my cats Persephone. Next is Pumpkinpie13. Lol! Sorry Toshiaki! xD Toshiaki: *crosses arms* Hmph! Zinka17: He'll forgive you soon enough. Thanks for answering all my questions and dares! Zinka17: No problem! That's what we're here for. (Sorry to Bob too!) Bob: *smiles* Ah, it's okay. I did look pretty funny in those skinny jeans, huh? I've got more. Victor: Are you related to Victor from Corpse Bride? Victor: No, but I can see why you would think that. We do look very similar, and we even have the same first name. Zinka17: But your last names are different. Victor: Yeah. Zinka17: You know who else looks very similar? Victoria's dad and Mayor Bergermeister. Elsa: I never really thought of that. I should have my uncle watch Corpse Bride soon so he can see the resemblance. And Edgar: I dare you to go to the mayor's house and replace the giant painting he has of himself with a picture of Tarzan. xDD (The mayor is Elsa's uncle.) Edgar: Finally! A dare I actually like! Elsa: Just don't get caught Edgar! My uncle will be furious if he sees you. Edgar: Aw, that old grouch doesn't scare me. Now all I need is a- Zinka17: Picture of Tarzan? Right here! *hands picture to Edgar* Edgar: Yes! I can't wait to put this up! Zinka17: *smirks* I doubt you'll be thinking that for long. Edgar: Just transport me to his house! Zinka17: Fine. *snaps fingers and Edgar is gone* Elsa: How are we supposed to see him do the dare? Zinka17: I've put some cameras in the mayor's house. Just let me pull the projector down and we'll see what's going on over there. *pulls down projector* Once again, everything in italics is the video. Well it's not really a video since it's live, but you know what I mean. Edgar: *hides behind a bush in the Mayor's yard, watching him as he waters his flowers* Good! His back is turned! Now I can go in the house. *walks quietly into the mayor's house and goes down the hallway until he sees a huge portrait of him hanging on the wall* Toshiaki: I bet he will get caught! Nassor: I think he can pull it off. The mayor is in his yard, not even paying attention. Toshiaki: Okay. How about a $10 bet then? Nassor: Deal. *shakes Toshiaki's hand* Zinka17: I don't think you're gonna win the bet Nassor. Nassor: Oh please. *waves hand dismissively* Edgar: *takes portrait down and replaces it with Tarzan picture* Now what should I do with this ugly painting? Mr. Bergermeister: Just what exactly do you think you're doing young man? Edgar: *turns around slowly and smiles nervously* Oh, h-hi mayor! I was just leaving! *starts to run* Mr. Bergermeister: *grabs Edgar* Oh no you don't! I'm going to have a little talk with your parents about this! Edgar: Uh oh... Nassor: Darn it! Toshiaki: *smiles and holds out hand* Pay up. Nassor: *grumbles and digs in pocket for money* Zinka17: Well I guess I'd better help Edgar. *snaps fingers and Edgar appears back in the room* Mr. Bergermeister: What the- Where'd he go? Edgar: That's right! I showed you old man! Zinka17: Uh, I'm the one who brought you back here Edgar! And you got caught, so you didn't really show him. Edgar: Ah whatever! At least I put the painting up! Elsa: Yeah, but it's not staying up there for long. Look! *points to projector* Mr. Bergermeister: *takes Tarzan picture down and rips it in two, then puts the portrait of himself back on the wall* Darn kids! Edgar: Hey! That Tarzan picture looked way better than that stupid self-portrait! Zinka17: Our next reviewer is Jackie. Nassor: I dare you to make out with Toshiaki for 30 minutes. (evil smile, grins and laughs) That's a dare and you can't back out. Nassor & Toshiaki: *eyes widen in horror* Nassor: N-no! Please don't make us do that! Anything but that! Please! I'll wear a pink dress and dance like a ballerina! I'll play the guitar very badly and sing off-key! Just don't make me do this dare! Toshiaki: Yes! Ditto what he said! Zinka17: *sighs* Look, I don't like it anymore than you do, but you all agreed to do this Truth or Dare and you knew that people could dare you to do whatever they want. Nassor: But this is so wrong! I don't like it! Zinka17: Look Nassor, just go into the back room so you don't have to do it in front of everyone. Nassor: But- Zinka17: No buts! Now go! Nassor: *seethes with rage and starts to walk away* Zinka17: You too Toshiaki. Toshiaki: *grumbles and follows Nassor* Elsa: I feel so bad for those two. Zinka17: Oh well they'll get over it. I hope... In the back room... Toshiaki: You know, they can't see us in here. Nassor: *smiles as he's hit with realization* You're right. And if they can't see us, they won't know what we're doing or not doing. Toshiaki: So we can just sit here and do nothing! Nassor: Yes! It's perfect! Toshiaki: But we're going to be in here for awhile. Nassor: *sighs* Yes. Such boredom. Back in the main room... Elsa: Are we gonna wait until the 30 minutes is up before we continue on with the Truth or Dare? Zinka17: Yes, because the next reviewer has a question for Toshiaki. So we'll just have to wait patiently. Edgar: But it'll be so boring! Zinka17: Well... We could have a party. All: YES! Zinka17: Okay then. I'll make the food first. Any suggestions? Bob: Pizza! Victor: Tacos! Elsa: Um... Strawberry cheesecake? Zinka17: Those are great ideas! *waves hands around as food starts to appear* Edgar: What about entertainment? Zinka17: I'm getting to that. *makes the last of the food appear and then plays loud, upbeat music* Edgar: Yeah! Now it's a party! *starts dancing* Zinka17: *rolls eyes and smiles in amusement* Okay, now the final touch. *turns the main lights off and makes lights of different colors and patterns appear* Okay, everything's set. Have fun! Bob: Alright! Food! *runs over to the food table and gets some of everything* Edgar: This party is so awesome! Zinka17: Thanks! I'm glad you're all having fun. In the back room... Nassor: Do you hear that? Toshiaki: Yeah. It sound like music! Nassor: I'm going to crack the door open and peek out. *walks quietly over to the door and cracks it open, looking out into the main room* Toshiaki: What going on out there? Nassor: I'll be darned! They're having a party while we're in here being bored! How could Zinka allow this? Toshiaki: *crosses arms and frowns* Well I going to complain about this when we go back out there! 30 minutes later... Zinka17: Okay everyone, time's up! Edgar: Aw, but I was still dancing! Zinka17: Don't worry, we'll have other parties. But we have to get Nassor and Toshiaki so we can get finished with the Truth or Dare. We still have a LOT of reviews to go through this chapter! Edgar: Oh alright. I'll go get them for you if you want! Zinka17: That'd be great! Thanks Edgar! Edgar: *smiles mischievously and goes to the back room, opening the door* You guys can come out now! Toshiaki: Finally! It about time! Nassor: Yes we were so bored in here! Edgar: You guys didn't enjoy kissing? *chuckles* Toshiaki: Very funny! Nassor: Let's just get out of here. Edgar, Nassor & Toshiaki: *walk into the main room* Zinka17: Hey guys! It was kinda lonely out here without you two. Toshiaki: How come you have party without us? Zinka17: How did you know? Nassor: You can't seriously expect that we wouldn't be able to hear that loud music! Toshiaki: Why you not wait for us? Zinka17: I'm really sorry guys, but we would've had to wait for 30 minutes! We would've been so bored, and we couldn't move on with the reviews because the next comment and question is for you, Toshiaki. Besides, we'll have other parties. Toshiaki: Oh fine! What is the next question? Zinka17: This is from AnotherGuest. I don't see what the big fuss is about Nassor. I think Toshiaki's the cute one. Nassor: *crosses arms* Hmph! Toshiaki: Ha! *points to Nassor* In your face! Which reminds me, I have a truth for him. I know you aren't interested in any girl, but do you have a type at least? (A cute Asian girl maybe?) Toshiaki: Uh... I don't really have a type. I could like any kind of girl. But I did have a crush on this girl back in Japan. *sighs dreamily* She so pretty! I miss her. Zinka17: Aw, Toshiaki likes someone! *hugs him* Toshiaki: Ah! Help me! Zinka17: *lets go* Our next reviewer is Whiteling. LOL at a few of the dares. Ok I'll give it a go. I got 2 truths for the whole gang. How did you all meet? Victor: We all met at school. Bob: Yeah, we've had the same class together for a few years now, so we've all gotten to know each other really well. Your most embarrassing moment? Zinka17: Okay, let's just go in the same order as you did earlier. Elsa: One time I was at the dog park with Persephone and she had to do her business, so I turned around to give her some privacy when all of a sudden I heard someone yelling nearby. I turned around and realized that she had been peeing on someone's foot! It was a really angry old man, so I apologized and backed up quickly, ready to get the heck out of there before he started scolding me. But I accidentally tripped over a rock and fell on my back. As if that wasn't bad enough, I landed on a pile of fresh dog poop. So I had to walk home with my new dress ruined and people pointing at me and laughing. Victor: In class a few weeks ago, Mr. Rzykruski- Zinka17: Sorry to interrupt you Victor, but I think we need to stop for a minute and explain to the readers why Mr. Rzykruski is your teacher again. We never mentioned it and since they saw him in the video of Toshiaki dancing to Gangnam Style I figured I should explain. Well anyway students were complaining because the gym teacher didn't know anything about science and they all really like Mr. Rzykruski, so they finally hired him back. Okay you can continue now Victor: Victor: So I was in class and Mr. Rzykruski asked for a volunteer because we were doing a lab. He asked me to get some glass beakers from the back of the room and bring them to the front so he could pour some chemicals in them. I went to go pick them up, but I didn't realize that my shoes were untied, so I tripped and dropped the beakers on the floor. I was already embarrassed because I fell flat on my face, and worried because I knew that Mr. Rzykruski would be mad at me for breaking his equipment. It got even worse because as I was getting up, I noticed that a piece of glass was stuck in my hand. It wasn't a super tiny piece either and my hand was bleeding, so I started crying. It was so embarrassing because Edgar was laughing at me the most and he called me a baby! *glares at Edgar* Edgar: Well it was hilarious! Victor: You wouldn't think so if it happened to you! Zinka17: Well Victor, maybe it'll make you feel better to hear Edgar's embarrassing story! Edgar: *blushes* Do I really have to share it? I already told you guys about my accident! Isn't that good enough? Zinka17: Not if something even more embarrassing happened to you. We wanna hear it! Edgar: *grumbles in anger* Oh alright! When I was in 3rd grade we went on a field trip to Six Flags. Toshiaki: Oh I remember that! That was fun! Edgar: Yeah well not for me! I went on Medusa right after I ate, and when we went down the huge drop, I got sick and threw up. It landed on the people in front of me and they were NOT happy! Then I was screaming the whole time because my stomach hurt and the ride was so fast and made me feel even sicker! Zinka17: Aw, poor Edgar! Although that is a pretty funny story. I went to Six Flags for a band field trip last Spring and all my friends went on Medusa, but I'm terrified of roller coasters and that one is the scariest! I was actually gonna go on one of those big wooden roller coasters even though I was afraid, but I had just eaten so I was afraid I would throw up if I went. That's why I wanted to go on it before I ate, but I was with my best friend, her brother and their mom, and my friend's brother has arthritis so he was in a wheelchair, and we had to get special reservations for certain times on the rides. It was lunchtime and we would've had to wait awhile to eat if we rode first, so I ended up not riding it while my friends did. So I didn't ride any roller coasters the whole trip! Oh well. We're going to Disneyland this spring, so I'll try to ride at least one. Oh wow I am extremely sorry! I didn't mean to rant that long. I guess I just got a little carried away because Edgar had a similar experience as me. Alright next! Weird Girl: Last year we had a school play and my teacher cast me as \"The Stalker\" because my eyes are so big and always open. She figured I stalk people in real life anyway, which I guess is kinda true, but it was still embarrassing because I had to wear a shirt that said \"Stalker\" in big letters. It was even worse because in the play, Edgar was the guy I was stalking the most, and back then he didn't know that I liked him, so I would always get really nervous during those scenes. And when the real play actually happened, I forgot some of my lines and the teacher scolded me afterwards. Zinka17: I hate it when I forget my lines! I've never actually been in a real school play, but we've had small ones in our classroom before. Next! Toshiaki: When I lived in Japan several years ago, we had a presentation to do in class. I was only in kindergarten so it was a simple assignment. You see, in Japan, everyone's name mean something. Our assignment was to tell everyone what our name was and what it meant. My crush's name was Emi, which means \"beautiful blessing\" or \"beautiful picture\". It definitely suits her. *sighs dreamily* Zinka17: Uh, Toshi? *waves hand in front of his face* Toshiaki: Oh! Sorry! Anyway, it was her turn to go up and I already knew what her name meant. I was at my desk sitting with my elbows up on the desk and my face resting on my hands, smiling at Emi. After she say what her name mean, I said, \"I can see why your parents named you that.\" I didn't mean to say it out loud, but I did and everyone stared at me. I could feel my face getting so warm. I just wanted to crawl under my desk and not look at anybody. And since then I could never talk to Emi without being really nervous. Zinka17: Aw, that's so adorable! I'm glad you're here with us, but I'm sorry you had to leave Japan because you obviously miss her. Toshiaki: Yeah. Oh well. She probably have boyfriend by now anyway. Zinka17: (A/N I think I may just have to make Emi an OC and write a story about her and Toshiaki... What do you guys think?) Victor: So what does your name mean Toshiaki? Toshiaki: It can mean 3 different things: \"bright and alert\", \"bright and clever\", or \"bright and happy\". Victor: So it pretty much means you're smart. Toshiaki: Yep! Bob: I always knew you were smart, but I had no idea that's what your name actually meant! Toshiaki: *smiles and nods proudly* Zinka17: Nassor, you're next. Nassor: *blushes* All of the guys in here already know this, but about a month ago I had a sleepover. Edgar: Oh I know where this is going! Nassor: So I invited Victor, Bob, Toshiaki and Edgar. My room was clean, but there were certain things in there that I had intended to hide because I didn't want them to see. Especially Edgar. Zinka17: What exactly did you have in there? Edgar: Pictures of you all over his walls! Zinka17: *smiles* Oh yeah! You told me about that recently. Nassor: *blushes* They are not ALL OVER my walls! There's maybe 2 or 3. Edgar: Liar! There's like over 20 of them! Zinka17: 20? *looks at Nassor* Really? Nassor: I- *faints* Victor: Not again! Zinka17: Oh dear. *kisses Nassor on the lips until his eyes open* Nassor: *smiles nervously* Sorry, I didn't mean to faint again. Zinka17: I think it's adorable that you keep fainting because you're embarrassed! But you need to continue with the story. Nassor: *rubs the back of his neck* Right. Well I forgot to take the pictures down before they came over, and Edgar noticed them as soon as he came in my room. He teased me about it and I told him to never tell anyone. He promised too! Edgar: I had my fingers crossed behind my back though. Nassor: *glares at Edgar* And then everybody else arrived. They teased me about it too, but I figured I could trust them . Anyway, after that, they saw something else that I would've preferred they hadn't. My stuffed hamster toy. Edgar spotted it first, so he grabbed it and started throwing it around. I yelled at him to stop because it was very special to me, and he asked why. I told him it reminded me of Colossus. So he started teasing me even more. Zinka17: Edgar! You brat! Apologize to Nassor right now! Edgar: Why? It was just a little fun! Zinka17: Apologize or else I'll show everyone the picture of you sleeping! It's a very embarrassing picture and I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone else to see it. Edgar: What picture?! Zinka17: *gets camera out and shows picture to Edgar* Edgar: Okay I'll apologize! Just don't show anyone that picture! Zinka17: Deal! *winks at readers* Edgar: *doesn't notice* I'm sorry I teased you about your obsession with hamsters and Zinka! Nassor: I will not accept that apology! Edgar: FINE! I'M SORRY I WAS BEING A BRAT! Nassor: I'll accept that. Zinka17: Okay Bob, you're the last one. Bob: This is actually something all of you know about. But you don't know the whole story. Remember when I fell down that manhole? Weird Girl: Of course! Mr. Whiskers predicted it would happen. Bob: *rolls eyes* Well, I stayed in there for about 20 minutes before someone finally came to get me out. But there was a little problem. I was stuck. Several people tried pulling me out, but I was too heavy, so they eventually had to get a crane to pick me up. It was so humiliating! The news came out and recorded it too, so everyone saw me on TV! Zinka17: Wow! I'll have to find the clip online sometime. Bob: NO! Zinka17: I'm just kidding! Well maybe. Anyway, Whitelinghas some dares. Now for the dares. (cackles like a witch)... Bob: Take a bite out of a jalapeño pepper. Bob: Aw man! My mouth will be on fire! Zinka17: Well you can drink some water right afterwards. *hands Bob a pepper* Bob: *takes bite* OH MY GOD! HOT HOT HOT! *drinks entire bottle of water* My mouth is STILL on fire! Zinka17: That's a strong pepper! *hands another bottle of water to Bob* Bob: *guzzles down bottle* Ah, that's better. Toshiaki: Walk with a book and a cup of water on your head. Toshiaki: Aw that's easy! Zinka17: Have you done it before? Toshiaki: No, but anyone can do that! Zinka17: I guess we'll see. *places a hardback book on top of Toshiaki's head followed by a full glass of water* Okay, start walking. Toshiaki: No problem. *takes 3 steps and the water spills all over the place and the book and cup both fall to the floor* Zinka17: Easy huh? Toshiaki: *frowns* Just get me a towel! Zinka17: Ask nicely! Toshiaki: Can I please have a towel? Zinka17: *hands towel to Toshiaki* Nassor: Let a lizard or squirrel run down your pants. Nassor: What?! Zinka17: I like this dare! Now which one do you choose Nassor? A lizard or squirrel? Nassor: *sighs in annoyance* A squirrel. Zinka17: One squirrel coming up! *snaps fingers and a random squirrel comes running through the room and right over to Nassor* Nassor: *eyes widen as the squirrel runs up his right pant leg* That tickles! *laughs* Zinka17: See? It's not so bad is it? Nassor: No! It's actually- OUCH! It bit me! *shakes leg several times until the squirrel falls out and runs away* You stupid rodent! Zinka17: Hey, you know you're insulting Colossus when you say that, right? Nassor: I didn't mean anything against other rodents! It was just a- Oh nevermind! Zinka17: The next reviewer is Registered2Comment. Aha, that was crazy awesome! I didn't realize my remarks (and ME!) would actually literally make it into the story! 8D Eeeeehehee! Oh, and you can just call me Reg or Reggie. (Short for Regina- and the name of this account, it just so happens. xD) I really am sorry for squeezing you too tightly, Nass... I hate seeing you get hurt so much... It's just... YOU ARE SO BLODDY ADORABLE, I can't stand it! Nassor: *blank stare* I don't really know how to respond to that. *ahem* Okay, I apologize for the outburst, too. Don't worry, I won't ever dare you to do anything that involves smooching Toshiaki again. Enough torture is enough. ;) Nassor & Toshiaki: THANK YOU! I nearly cried when you got punched. (Why, why, why?! Senseless violence against the lovable!) ;_; Nassor: See? She agrees with me! Zinka17: I'm sorry Nassor! *hugs him* And when you confessed your pain over losing Colossus- I FEEL YOU, MAN. I've lost so many dogs and all kinds of animals, and it always hurts so much, no matter what kind they are. My sweet, smart, loving betta fish passed away a little over a month ago, and I still cry sometimes when I think about him and look at where his house was. ;; I MISS YOU, KARL. And my old hamster, Mrs. White... and the mice (Petruccio, Sucrose, Ben)... And all the many, many others (dogs, fishies, birds, bunnies, reptiles, amphibians, bugs) that I've had in the past! D'X You can never replace them, but sometimes another animal can help ease the loss... Whoops, don't wanna break down in a review of a humorous story... Zinka17: It's okay. I understand just how you feel. Like I mentioned earlier, I've had a lot of pets die over the years. They become part of your family and it feels like your kid dies when one of them leaves you. At least that's how it is for me. I always call my cats and guinea pig my daughters. Anyways, that last session was most entertaining (and revealing... and cruel... and at times extremely gross. xD) Yeah, I dunno why Harriet works so well. Marie was another possibility I considered, but it's much more common, and she just looks more like a Harriet... anyhoo. Toshiaki's secret was great. Poor him, with all the guy-kissing... xD I think CityCat's upcoming question and dares are particularly great. Toshiaki's voice is spot-on... and I think what we're witnessing kind of IS Edgar's form of awkwardness. XD; So now I see exactly how this works... We can make you guys do or say anything... hoo, boy. Well, I'll give the kisses a rest for awhile. OH WAIT, EXCEPT FOR ONE. Pheh, might as well get it done... Edgar, I \"dare\" you to snog Harriet! ;D Edgar: Yes! Thank you! *starts to walk over to Weird Girl* Zinka17: *stops him* Wait! You can't kiss her for an entire chapter, remember? Edgar: *frowns* Oh yeah. 'Cause of stupid X! Zinka17: Now now Edgar, don't call reviewers stupid. You can kiss Weird Girl after the chapter is over. Edgar: Uugghhh! Fine! I'd like the rest of you to answer truthfully a question that plagues so many of us bronies and Pegasisters... Who is best pony?! And if you really don't know, then I'm afraid I'll have to dare y'all to... *is overcome with wickedness* Play a game of strip poker. Guess I'll save my other thoughts. x} That should be good for now... Zinka17: Hm... I've never seen My Little Pony. Have you guys? All: *shake heads and say no* Zinka17: Well you can't say who your favorite character is if you don't know any of the characters. And um... I think strip poker is a little inappropriate for a T rated story... Besides, I'm not entirely sure how it's played. I get the basic idea but... Anyway, I'm sorry. Please don't be angry! I promise I'll make it up to you somehow! Next is red-eyedgal. HIYA GUYS! So Toshiaki made a comment that he doesn't like any girls right now because there's no pretty ones around... or something along that line. So Toshiaki, what's your type of girl? *wink wink* 333 lol Toshiaki: Well now you know I like a girl named Emi, but she in Japan and I probably never see her again. I mean, maybe I will since I visit once a year, but I don't know. Zinka17: *smiles* Toshiaki: What you smiling about? Zinka17: Oh, nothing. I was just thinking of a story I'm probably going to write. Toshiaki: Okay... Zinka17: The next dare is from Another Guest. All right, I'm going to post a dare: I dare the whole cast to sing and dance to \"What I Was Born To Do\" from Bring it On the musical. Edgar: Wait now, sing what from what?! Zinka17: I don't know. I've never heard of that song or movie, but it's easy to look up a video on YouTube. Edgar: Aw come on! I don't do singing! And I can't stand musicals! Zinka17: Edgar, please shut up. *goes on YouTube and looks for a video* Um, there aren't any videos of the actual scene, so I can't really have them do the dance, but they can still sing it! Edgar: No! Zinka17: Come on. You guys have to memorize the song. 1 hour later... Zinka17: Everyone ready? Edgar: No. Zinka17: Okay, sing! Weird Girl: I was in the stands Rooting for our team When I saw the Buccaneer's cheer for the first time Standing on their hands Every move extreme I looked around, do these people see what I see? These Truman girls were super-human girls And when they started to fly, I knew That I would find a way to be up there one day ' Cause in that moment I finally knew what I was born to do All: Go, go, go Campbell, go Campbell, go Campbell, go, go, go Campbell, GO! Weird Girl: Believed I was gonna be a cheerleader Like the Buccaneer's in front of me So I stumbled 'til I tumbled then I made the team Now my life is every adolescents favorite dream Slow-motion down the hall All: Hey! Weird Girl: As kids all stop and stare I feel like I'm part of it all for the first time And if I ever fall All: No! Weird Girl: I know my squad is there ' Cause I've got the Buccaneer's here behind me All: These Truman girls are super human girls And there is nothing that they can't do Nothing that they can't do And beyond all the squads They're semi-demi-gods And when our powers combined We do what we were born to do Hey, Ready? OKAY! Edgar: My name is Skylar I rep the Buc's with pride I'm probably too cool for you so friend request denied All: Oh! Victor: I'm Kylar, from Tyler, my real name is Ines But Skylar said to change it and I do what Skylar says! Elsa: My name is Brigitte, I rock the parrot head It's hot in here and kinda smells like someone wet the bed All: Gross! Nassor: What's up, my name is Steven, I'm so handsome it hurts Don't need an umbrella, I stand under miniskirts All: What! Nassor: Yeah, I'm a bouncer, don't care what the haters say How many dudes can say they pick up girls all day? Love you... Weird Girl: Love you more Toshiaki: Oh yay, cheerleader try-outs are tonight, pick me Bob: No, pick me. Even mocking cheerleaders cannot hide the emptiness in my soul Weird Girl: Hey You never met me face-to-face If you think cheerleaders are a waste of space We work and we fight and train and hustle We get mani/pedi's but we're made of muscle We got one shot that we work all year for We got more balls that the team we cheer for Nationals is getting closer by the minute All: Last year, we took bronze, this year we're gonna win it! Bring it! Weird Girl: Counting down the days All: Hey! Weird Girl: Making new routines All: Hey! Weird Girl: Drawing out a tumbling pass for the first time All: Whoa Weird Girl: Calling on a play All: Hey! Here behind the scenes All: Hey! Weird Girl: I look around, do these people see what I see? All: I see these Truman girls are super-human girls We've got the spirit and we'll see it through We've got the spirit and we'll see it through We gladly pay our dues with every sprain and bruise Weird Girl: Because we're doing what we're born to do All: Doing what we're born to do Doing what we're born to do Weird Girl: Doing what we're born to do There is so much more to do I can see it in my mind, this moment's mine When we win first place, we'll know how bright we shine We will move like parts of a finely tuned design Not a wasted throw, not a tie across the line All: This moment's mine This moment's mine Weird Girl: We will leave it on the floor All: We will leave it on the floor We will leave it on, leave it on Weird Girl: 'Cause this is why we were born All: Go, go, go go! Weird Girl: Oh! All: T-R-U-M-A-N, Truman High! Weird Girl: There is no second place, you're either flying or falling All: Go, go, let's go! Weird Girl: Oh! All: T-R-U-M-A-N, Truman High! Weird Girl: C'mon pick up the pace, I hear destiny callin' All: Go, go, let's go! Weird Girl: Oh! All: These Truman girls T-R-U-M-A-N, Truman High! Weird Girl: You cannot be afraid to fall down and work through this Oh! ' Cause this is what we're born to do so let's do it! Zinka17: *claps* Great job everyone! Edgar: Oh thank GOD that's over! That's the most annoying song ever! I hate musicals so much! Zinka17: I'm not really a fan of them either but you guys did a great performance. I was trying not to laugh when guys had to sing girl parts! And when Nassor had his solo! Nassor: *blushes* Why did you give me that part? Zinka17: Well hey, the part about you being handsome is true. I hope you liked the song now have a review from sunnettle12199. Alright! I got a TRUTH to ask Nassor and Toshiaki... W-what type of people or things would interest you deeply? Toshiaki: *sighs* How many times we have to go over this? I don't have a type! Zinka17: Calm down Toshi! She said you can talk about things too, not just people. Toshiaki: Oh, well I like playing video games. Zinka17: Hey, so do I! Nassor: Well, as far as people go, as you know, I like Zinka. As far as things go, uh, I guess I like animals. Zinka17: Me too! I love animals so much! Especially cats. And Zinka17, I have become a fan of these chapters you make! :D Keep going! C/x Zinka17: I sure will! And thanks! Our next reviewer is Seeing Spirits. Elsa: Are you related to Dr. Van Helsing from Dracula? Elsa: Um... Not that I know of. We just happen to have the same last name. Victor: Can you reanimate my babysitter's cat Sherman? Victor: Sorry, but it's too much hassle to keep bringing animals back to life. It causes trouble and I don't wanna be responsible for it. I'm sorry about your babysitter's cat though. Edgar: Eat a live fish. Edgar: Ew! That's disgusting! I'm not Smeagol from Lord of the Rings! Zinka17: Funny you should use that reference Edgar because I LOVE Lord of the Rings! I've recently become obsessed with it. And anyway, you have to do the dare! *makes a cod fish appear* Edgar: Oh man, I'm gonna puke after this! *eats the fish* *gags and twitches* Zinka17: Go to the trashcan please! Edgar: *puts hands over his mouth, sprints to the trashcan and throws up* Zinka17: Poor Edgar. Nassor: Send me a love note to my locker that Zinka17 makes appear. Nassor: W-what? But I'm with Zinka! Zinka17: It's okay Nassor. Just do it to make her happy. Nassor: Okay if you say so. *gets out a piece of paper and writes \"I love you Seeing Spirits ~Nassor\" on it* Zinka17: Okay I'll take that. *scribbles something on it real quick and makes it vanish* Nassor: What did you write on it? Zinka17: Oh, nothing. *smiles mischievously* At Seeing Spirits' school... Seeing Spirits: *opens locker* OH MY GOSH IT'S HERE! *unfolds paper and reads* I love you Seeing Spirits ~Nassor *frowns* P.S. If you try to steal my boyfriend, I'll hunt you down and beat you up! ~Zinka17 Back in the Truth or Dare room... Toshiaki: Can you teach me Japanese? Toshiaki: Uh, well I guess I could but it kinda hard to teach someone the entire language. It would be better if you got a program or professional teacher to teach it to you. Bob: Jump down the manhole you fell down. Bob: What?! After what happened last time?! Zinka17: C'mon! *transports everyone to the manhole* Get going Bob! Bob: *grumbles and jumps down the manhole* Yeah, I'm stuck. Zinka17: Could we get a crane over here please? 20 minutes later in the Truth or Dare room... AAAAANNND... hmm. I guess I'll talk to Sparky using an animal talker. Sparky: Leave Mayor Van Helsing a little \"present\". *grins wickedly* Sparky: *wags his tail* HECK YEAH! Now we're having some fun! Elsa: Oh, just to let you know, my uncle's last name is Bergermeister, not Van Helsing. His sister is my mom, so her last name was changed to Van Helsing when she married my dad. Zinka17: I'll transport Sparky to his house and we'll watch him on the projector, just like we did with Edgar earlier. And don't worry Sparky, I'll zap you back here before the mayor can catch you. Sparky: Sounds good to me! Zinka17: *transports Sparky to Mayor Bergermeister's house* Sparky: *walks over to a bunch of flowers in the yard* This looks like a good spot!*does his business* Mr. Bergermeister: *walks over to flowers* Now to water my beautiful- AH! YOU! YOU'VE RUINED MY FLOWERS! I'm gonna get you you mangy beast! Sparky: Oh no you won't!*disappears* Mr. Bergermeister: What the- Why does everyone keep disappearing? *grumbles and goes over to the flowers* Damn dogs! Zinka17: Haha, great job Sparky! Sparky: It was nothing, really. Zinka17: Next is Anonymous. Victor: I dare you to bark like a dog every time you hear a loud noise. ;) LMAO Dis so funny! :D Victor: Uh, okay? Zinka17: *bangs pots and pans together* Victor: Bark! Zinka17: *laughs* The next reviewer is Shinigamilover2. I'll be nice with my dares. Victor: I dare you to dress up like Eric Draven from 'The Crow' and that includes the face makeup and take a picture of you in the costume and show it to your parents. (This dare is to honor the memory of Brandon Lee. R.I.P.) Victor: Who's Eric Draven and Brandon Lee? And what's The Crow? Zinka17: I don't know, but I'll just look up a picture of the costume online and get you a matching one to wear. Victor: I hope it's nothing weird. Zinka17: *smirks* Oh it's weird alright. Come look at the picture. Victor: What?! I don't wanna wear that! Zinka17: Oh come on you'll look great! *poofs up a costume for Victor to wear* Here! Go get changed and come right back. Victor: *sighs* A few minutes later... Victor: *comes back out wearing a black leather shirt, pants, boots, and cape with a long black wig and white face paint with black lips and eyeliner* I look ridiculous. Zinka17: After I take a picture you can take the costume off. *takes picture* Okay it's done. Victor: Yes! Thank you! *runs into the back room to take costume off* Zinka17: *yells* But you're not done yet! You still have to show the picture to your parents when you get back! Victor: Okay! *comes back a few minutes later looking normal* *grabs picture* I hope they don't freak out. Zinka17: Well I guess we'll just have to wait and see. *transports Victor to his house* Victor: Hey, Mom and Dad? I wanna show you something. Well I don't really want to but- *hands them the picture* Mrs. Frankenstein: Oh. Oh my! Where on Earth did you get this outfit? Victor: Uh, well that's kind of a long story. Let's just say a friend of mine told me to dress up that way without my consent and made me show you a picture of it. Mr. Frankenstein: Well it sure looks... interesting. Victor: Yeah. Well I gotta go now. Bye! *disappears* Mrs. Frankenstein: Where'd he go? Mr. Frankenstein: He just vanished! Victor: *back in the Truth or Dare room* Well, they didn't freak out! Zinka17: They did after you vanished into thin air right before their eyes. Victor: Well that's your fault, not mine. Victor: I dare you to sing a song of my choice in front of everyone, including Elsa. I choose... 'No Reflection' by Marilyn Manson. Victor: What's with people daring us to sing songs we've never heard of? Zinka17: How are they supposed to know what songs you know and don't know? Victor: I don't wanna have to memorize another song! Zinka17: Well too bad, 'cause you are! 1 hour later... Zinka17: You ready Victor? Victor: I guess so. Zinka17: Okay then. Sing! Victor: Oh, ah ah ah ah Oh, ah ah ah ah, oh Oh, ah ah ah ah Oh, ah ah ah ah, oh Oh, ah ah ah ah Oh, ah ah ah ah, oh Crushing, cheating, changing Am I deaf or dead? Is this constricting construction Or just streets with rusty signs Of something violent coming?

Victor: Thanks. I guess. All: What's your favorite scary movie? Zinka17: Have any of you guys even seen a scary movie? Besides Bob that is. I know he watches rated R movies. Edgar: Well, can it be scary kid movies? Like ours for example. Zinka17: That's fine. Or you could say which scary rated R movies you want to see. Either way. Elsa: Well, my favorite movie is Coraline, so it's my favorite scary movie too. Victor: I've always wanted to see It. Elsa: You mean that movie with the creepy clown? Victor: Yeah. Elsa: *shudders* Not me. Edgar: I like Gremlins. Bob: Those things remind me of the sea monkeys! Weird Girl: I like The Corpse Bride a lot. Toshiaki: I want to see Paranormal Activity. Nassor: I've always wanted to see Child's Play. Zinka17: Hey, me too! Bob: I like Monster House. Zinka17: Okay we have a comment from sunnettle12199. Dx Give us the next chapter soon. Please... Zinka17: And that was written almost a month ago. Now I feel really guilty for not updating sooner! Well the chapter is here now. Our next reviewer is Golden Rose. Weird Girl (Harriet): Don't talk for 1 hour! My name is also Harriet! Weird Girl: But if I don't talk how can I- Zinka17: Hush! Your 1 hour starts now! Weird Girl: *frowns* Zinka17: Don't worry. If you have to answer a question before then you can just write it down. Next up is Guest. Victor: What is your opinion of each character here? Victor: Edgar is my best friend, even if he can be a little creepy and bratty sometimes. Edgar: Hey! Victor: Elsa I love very much. Elsa: Aw! Victor: Weird Girl I think is... weird. No offense. Weird Girl: *rolls eyes* Victor: Toshiaki is smart. Almost as smart as me! Toshiaki: Well, I not that smart! Victor: Bob is really nice. Bob: Thanks! I try to be. Victor: And Nassor used to really creep me out, but he's cool now. Nassor: *gasps and fakes hurt* Well I never! Victor: I'm sorry! I didn't mean- Nassor: Oh it's fine. I am kind of intimidating. Zinka17: No you're not! *kisses Nassor on the cheek* Nassor: *smiles* Thanks. Elsa: What was your first reaction when you first saw the white stripes in Persephone's hair? Elsa: It didn't really bother me, but I wondered how on Earth they got there. I eventually learned that it was because she got electrocuted by Sparky, but until then, I was puzzled. I actually think they look better on her. Persephone: Yeah, but it hurt when I got them! Zinka17: *smiles* Our next reviewer is one of my favorite authors, flowerpower71! I still can't believe she's actually reading one of my stories. She has a story similar to this, but it's for The Smurfs and it's just questions, not dares. If any of you are Smurfs fans, I highly recommend reading it and her other stories. I just watched Frankenweenie for the first time today (didn't get to see it when it was out in theaters) so obviously I HAD to search for fanfics. XD Nassor: I dare you to take Zinka out on a date to any fancy restaurant of her choosing and then a romantic moonlight walk after. (Or a movie after. Her choice.) ;3 Nassor: *blushes* So, uh, where do you want to go. Zinka17: *smiles* Let's just go to that restaurant that's in Downtown New Holland. What's it called again? Nassor: New Holland Bistro. Zinka17: Sounds good to me! Let's go! *grabs Nassor's arm and runs off with him* Elsa: Bye! Have fun on your date! 1 hour later at the New Holland Bistro... Zinka17: Oh Nassor, I'm having so much fun. I know you were dared to do this but still. You're the sweetest boyfriend! Nassor: Anything for you my darling. I'll start taking you on dates all the time, whether I'm dared to or not. Zinka17: So, are you ready to go? Nassor: Yes. Have you decided if you'd prefer the movie or the walk? Zinka17: The walk! I go to movies all the time, so I want to do something different for a change. Besides, I can take us to the beach! Nassor: Really? I-I've never been to the beach before. Zinka17: You haven't?! Oh man we have to go now! *grabs Nassor's arm and drags him off again* At the beach... Zinka17: *holds Nassor's hand as they walk along the shore* Isn't the beach beautiful at nighttime? Nassor: *stops walking and cups Zinka's face in his hands* Not as beautiful as you. Zinka17: *smiles* Aw, Nassor! I love you! *kisses him* 30 minutes later back in the Truth or Dare room... Victor: Look! They're back! Elsa: Did you have fun? Zinka17: We sure did! This was the best night of my life. Nassor: Yes, and I went to the beach for the first time. Edgar: *gasps* You've never been to the beach before?! What is wrong with you?! Zinka17: Well we can all go again tomorrow morning. How does that sound? All: YES! Zinka17: Great! But for now we must continue with the chapter. Toshi: (Yes I'm calling you Toshi. Deal with it!) Was Shelley your pet turtle or did you randomly dig up a random turtle from the cemetery? Odd questions I know but it was never specified in the movie. *nervous laugh* Toshiaki: He was my pet. That why I was so sad when he died a second time. *sighs in depression* Victor: Sorry Toshiaki, but electrocuting him was the only way to save the town. Toshiaki: I know. I just miss him so much. Weird Girl: My deepest apologies for Mr. Whiskers. :'( But um... What in the world possessed you to actually TOUCH his crap?! And then carry it around in your pocket?! Weird Girl: Well a long time ago, I never would've even thought of doing that, but then I started noticing weird things when I went to clean the litter box. Not to be gross, but his poop was in the shape of different letters. I thought that was weird enough, but then when strange things started happening to people around town, I realized that the letters were their first initial. I put two and two together and knew that my precious Mr. Whiskers had been gifted with psychic abilities. I just had to warn the people ahead of time, so I showed them the omen and offered to let them keep it, but none of them ever did. I never actually touched it with my bare hands though. I picked it up with a napkin. Zinka17: Well then... Next dare! Victor: I dare you to serenade Elsa. XD Any song of your choice but it has to be romantic. Victor: Why do I have to keep singing?! Zinka17: Hey, at least this time you get to pick which song you want, so you can do one you already memorize instead of having to learn one. Plus, you're singing it for Elsa. Victor: Yeah, I guess you're right. Hm... I choose Fly Love by Jamie Foxx. Zinka17: That's one of my favorite songs! My little brother watches Rio practically every day, so I hear it all the time. Plus I have it on my iPod. Anyway, I need to take you to a proper place to do a serenade. *snaps fingers and everyone is outside with a full moon shining* *everyone is standing outside of a two story building, except for Elsa who is on the balcony looking down at everyone* Elsa: What the- Victor: So... I'm just supposed to sing to her from down here on the ground while she admires me? Zinka17: That's pretty much it. Victor: And all of you are going to watch? Zinka17: Of course! Victor: Okay... So are you gonna play the instrumental version of the song while I sing over it? Zinka17: Well I could do that, but I think it would be more romantic if you played the guitar. Victor: But I don't know how to play the guitar, or any musical instrument for that matter. Zinka17: Not a problem. I'll just use my magic to give you excellent guitar-playing skills. Victor: Really? That'd be awesome! Zinka17: *waves hands at Victor, making a blue glow surround him for a few seconds* Victor: D-did it work? Zinka17: Play and find out! Victor: *strums a few notes on the guitar* It worked! This is awesome! Zinka17: Good! Now play the song and sing for your dear Elsa. Victor: *whistles, then starts playing the guitar* Wasn't really thinking Wasn't looking Wasn't searching for an answer In the moonlight When I saw your face Saw you looking at me Saw you peeking out From under moon beams Through the palm trees Swaying in the breeze I know I'm feeling so much more Than ever before And so I'm giving more to you Than I thought I could do Don't know how it happened Don't know why But you don't really need a reason When the stars shine Just to fall in love Made to love each other Made to be together For a lifetime In the sunshine Flying in the sky I know I'm feeling so much more Than ever before And so I'm giving more to you Than I thought I could do *whistles* Oh *whistles* Now I know love is real So when sky high As the angels try Letting you and I Fly love All: *applauding* Elsa: Victor, that was so beautiful! And even though you were dared to do it, I know you meant it. Victor: *blushing* You're welcome Elsa. Anything for you. Zinka17: They are so freaking CUTE together! I can't stand it! Well, back to the Truth or Dare room. *transports everyone back* Victor: That was so much fun! I love playing the guitar! Zinka17: Too bad, 'cause now I'm taking your power away. *takes Victor's guitar-playing ability away* Victor: What?! No! Why?! Zinka17: It was just so you could do the serenade properly! If you want to learn a musical instrument, you need to do it the hard way. With lots and lots of practice! That's how I learned how to play the flute. Victor: But you've been playing for 7 years! I can't wait that long to be good at the guitar! Zinka17: It won't take you 7 years! That's just how long I've been playing for, but I knew how to play it quite a bit during the first year. You just have to practice a lot to get good. Victor: Oh alright. Edgar: I dare you to dance the tango with Weird Girl. Edgar: But I'm no good at dancing! Zinka17: You did nothing but dance at the party earlier! Edgar: Well yeah but that was different! That was just random dancing. I don't know how to dance the tango. Zinka17: Just try your best. Edgar: *sighs* Okay. *looks at Weird Girl* Do you know how to dance the tango? Weird Girl: *shakes head no* Edgar: Oh well. I guess we'll just have to wing it. Zinka17: You know, you can talk now Weird Girl. It's been over an hour. Weird Girl: Oh thank goodness! Zinka17: We need some music! *claps hands and tango music starts playing* Edgar: *grabs Weird Girl's hands and dips her down, almost dropping her* Whoa! I'm sorry! *laughs nervously and walks forward a few times, then turns around and walks the other way, surprisingly keeping in sync with Weird Girl's feet* A few minutes later... Edgar: Well, that was actually really fun! I didn't think I could do it, but I did! Weird Girl: You were great Edgar! Bob: Do you have a deep fear of sea monkeys now after the events of the movie? Bob: Yes! I hate those demonic little creatures! They're so evil! Toshiaki: Hey Bob... Bob: What? *turns towards Toshiaki who is holding a fake sea monkey* AH! *runs away* Toshiaki: *laughing hysterically* It just a plastic toy! Bob: *stops running and looks back* Oh, uh, I knew that! Hehe. Toshiaki: *raises eyebrows* Sure. Sparky and Persephone: I dare you two to reenact the spaghetti scene from Lady and the Tramp. And that's all. Please update soon! :D Persephone: So this is the dare you were talking about earli er! Zinka17: Yep! So, I need to get some props set up for you two. *makes a table with a white and red plaid tablecloth suddenly appear with breadsticks and a candle on top of it* Now for the main thing! *makes a plate of spaghetti with several meatballs on it appear* Okay, do your thing! Sparky & Persephone: *sit down at the table and each start slurping up noodles until they get to a noodle that they both happen to be chewing on at the same time* *keep chewing on noodle until their faces touch* Persephone: *looks away shyly and smiles* Sparky: *rolls the last meatball towards Persephone* Sparky & Persephone: *smile lovingly at each other* Sparky: *waits for a few seconds to see if Persephone will make a move* *when she doesn't, he eats the meatball in one bite* Zinka17: Sparky! That wasn't in the script! Sparky: *whimpers* Sorry, but it looked so good and she wasn't eating it! Zinka17: *sighs* She wasn't supposed to! In Lady and the Tramp, no one ends up eating the meatball. At least, they don't show it happening. So you were both supposed to just leave it. Sparky: Oops. Zinka17: *sighs* Nevermind. Our next reviewer is TheMaskedHunter. Victor: I dare you to act like a werewolf for 5 minutes. Victor: Okay. That's easy. *goes outside and sits under the full moon, then howls loudly* 5 minutes later... Victor: See, I told you it was easy. Zinka17: Yep. Next is Corpsebridelover. Victor: Get on a high sugar rush. :) Victor: Um, you guys may want to leave the room for awhile. Bob: Why? Victor: Because when I get on a sugar rush, I get VERY hyper and violent. Zinka17: I'm sure it's not that bad. *hands Victor 10 chocolate bars, 5 cans of soda and an entire 2-layer chocolate cake* If that doesn't give you a sugar rush I don't know what will. Victor: *eats everything in 5 seconds* *eyes go wide and he starts jumping around everywhere, knocking stuff over and breaking things* Toshiaki: AH! *runs as Victor bounces towards him, but he's too late* *falls down holding his left arm* OW! I think my arm broken! Zinka17: Let me see! *rushes over to Toshiaki* Can you move it? Toshiaki: *lifts arm up and moves it back and forth a few times* Yes, but it hurt so bad! Zinka17: Well, at least it's not broken. I think all of us should step outside until Victor's sugar rush wears off. All: *go outside* 45 minutes later... Victor: *holding head* Aw man, what happened? Zinka17: You were on a sugar rush. Victor: Oh, that explains why you were all outside. Hehe, sorry for all the damage I caused. Zinka17: Ah, don't worry about it. I can clean it up instantly with my magic. The next reviewer is anonononononymous. Toshiaki: I dare you to kiss Elsa. Full on the lips. Toshiaki: Well, it not Emi, but hey, at least I not kissing a guy for once! Elsa: Yeah yeah, just get it over with! Toshiaki: *kisses Elsa* Zinka17: Alright, next is MnMsareyummy. Victor: I dare you to run across the street yelling \"I'm a scientist\" at the top of your lungs while wearing nothing but your underwear and a lab coat. Victor: What?! Okay first of all, that's embarrassing as heck. And second of all, it's nighttime! People will be sleeping and they'll get mad at me for waking them up. Plus it'll be freezing! Elsa: Hey, I had to wear this bra and short shorts outfit when we were out there earlier, so you can do it. Victor: Oh fine. *strips down to his underwear and puts a lab coat on* All: *laughing at him* Victor: *face is beet red* Stop it! I'm already very self conscious! Zinka17: Then hurry and start running! The sooner you start, the sooner you can finish and put your clothes back on. Victor: I know! *goes outside and runs down the street* I'M A SCIENTIST! I'M A SCIENTIST! Mr. Bergermeister: *opens door and frowns* So, it's Victor Frankenstein, huh? That kid has gotten on my last nerve! First his weird friend comes and replaces my self portrait with a picture of Tarzan, then his dog comes and poops on my flowers, and now he's woken me up! This is the last straw! I'm calling his parents! *gets out phone and starts to dial, but then it vanishes into thin air and leaves black soot all over his face* AGH! *goes back inside and slams door closed* Victor: *comes back in the Truth or Dare room* Whew! I'm done! Thanks for making the phone disappear Zinka. *puts clothes back on* Zinka17: No problem. The next dares are from RandomEnigma. Victor: I dare you to kiss Weird Girl on the cheek. Victor: *sighs* People sure have been daring me a lot lately. *kisses Weird Girl's cheek* Elsa: I dare you to kiss Weird Girl on the lips for 3 seconds. Elsa & Weird Girl: *eyes go wide* (Well, as much wider as Weird Girl's eyes can go anyway) Elsa: I feared this would happen. *sighs and kisses Weird Girl for 3 seconds* Elsa & Weird Girl: *wipe mouths off* Toshiaki: I dare you to burst into a crowded room and loudly yell BANZAI! Toshiaki: Aw man! That so embarrassing! Where I even supposed to go? Zinka17: I'll find somewhere for you. Hm... Let me think. Where is a place that's always crowded, even at this time of the night? Um... Maybe a bowling alley? Toshiaki: Okay. Let's just hurry and go so I can get it over with! Zinka17: I don't think it's as bad as Victor's dare when he had to go running down the street yelling in his underwear. Victor: Why did you have to bring that up? Zinka17: *shrugs shoulders and transports Toshiaki to a bowling alley* Toshiaki: *looks around for a minute before taking a deep breath and running around the room* BONZAI! BONZAI! 5 minutes later... Toshiaki: Uh, Zinka? I still here! You can bring me back now! Zinka17: Oh, fine. *brings Toshiaki back* Toshiaki: Thank goodness that over! Everyone was staring at me! Zinka17: That was kinda the point. Nassor: I dare you to wear a 'Mexican' style mustache for 24 hours. Nassor: What?! Zinka17: That'll look hilarious on you! *makes a fake mustache appear and places it on Nassor's face* *bursts out laughing* Nassor: I'm sure it's not that funny! Victor: Oh it is! Nassor: Can I please see a mirror? Zinka17: Sure! There's one over there. *points to the other end of the room* Nassor: *goes over to mirror and takes a look* Oh my! This makes me look awful! And I have to keep it on until this time tomorrow night! Zinka17: You'll live. Bob: I dare you to do 10 push ups. Bob: Are you trying to kill me? I can't even do one! Zinka17: Just try your best Bob. Bob: *groans and gets in a push up position* 10 minutes later... Toshiaki: He still hasn't even done 1 yet! Zinka17: *sighs* Okay Bob you can get up now. It's obvious you can't do it. Bob: THANK YOU! My arms are killing me! Edgar: I dare you to compliment Elsa 10 times. Edgar: Aw what? I don't wanna compliment her! She's the wrong girl! I should be complimenting my dear sweet Harriet! Zinka17: Just do it Edgar. Just because you say it doesn't mean you actually mean it. Edgar: Alright alright! *turns towards Elsa* You're smart, you're pretty, you're kind, you're amazing, you're funny, you're wonderful, you're honest, you're a great friend, you're talented and you have a great singing voice. Elsa: *jaw dropped to the ground* Edgar: Whew glad that's over! Toshiaki: *whispers to Zinka* I have a feeling he meant all of that. Zinka17: *giggles* Weird Girl: I dare you to kiss Edgar, be it on the cheek or lips, your choice. Edgar: YES! *rushes over to Weird Girl* Zinka17: NO EDGAR! You keep forgetting! You can't kiss her at all during this chapter! Edgar: DARN IT! *grabs a random hat and stomps it on the ground* Zinka17: Temper tantrum! (For the record, I dared Elsa to kiss Weird Girl to \"balance\" out all the M on M kissing.) Elsa: *sarcastic tone* Well that's comforting. Zinka17: Alright, this chapter is already over 14,000 words, and keep in mind that after it's written I have to go back and re-read it so I can edit it and fix typos, so I'm gonna have to use the last 3 reviews in the next chapter. I'm really sorry to Anony-mouse007, Simbasson, and Lordturrets, but your reviews will be the first ones of the next chapter. It's just that I worked on this chapter literally ALL DAY yesterday and I still didn't get to finish it. That's just too much writing. And I really wanted to update today since you've all had to wait for so long. Plus, if I didn't do it today, I probably wouldn't be able to again for awhile because I don't have internet at home, but I'm going somewhere where I'll have internet access today. Please don't be angry with me for not using your reviews! I hope you understand. Elsa: I'm sure they'll understand just fine. We don't wanna overwork our wonderful author now do we? Zinka17: Haha. Oh, I also wanted to let everyone know that you can submit questions for me as well. I don't wanna do any dares because I know how cruel you people can be! LOL But I'll gladly answer any questions. And from now on I'll just assume that if you have a truth for everyone that I'm included, so I'll be answering it. Well thank you to everyone who's been reading and reviewing and we'll see you next chapter![Chapter 5] Mina: (A/N: Ok guys, this is important! Apparently we're not allowed to write interactive fics on here, so instead of putting your Truth/Dares in a review, please PM them to me! If you don't have an account, then…make one, because there's not really any other way. It's not that hard, and it's free, so...yeah! Sign up for an account. Ok, let's start.) Hey guys, and welcome to another chapter of Truth or Dare: Frankenweenie style! So…as you can see, I'm not Zinka. Edgar: No, really ? Mina: Shut up. Anway. I'm assuming y'all got her note. If you didn't, well, basically, Zinka was really stressed out from writing this fic, since she always got so many reviews (not that that's a bad thing! Just try to keep your reviews short, please.), because she wanted to work on other stories/deviantART drawings, and because she isn't as obsessed with Frankenweenie as before. So I'm here to take her place. Now, without further ado…our first reviewer is Anony-mouse007! Nassor: I dare you to dance like a ballerina in front of 10 people. Nassor: *sighs* If I must… Mina: Wait! We need three more people! Nassor: Oh, goodness… Random people in New Holland: *appear* Classical Music: *plays* Nassor: *leaps gracefully across room and performs a pirouette* Audience: *tentative applause* Random people: *are transported back to where they were originally* Toshiaki: I dare you to smell Bob's arm pits then smell Edgar's feet. Mina: Lovely. Toshiaki: Oh, gross! Why are Bob's armpits always so sweaty? Edgar: At least you don't have to lick them! *shudders* Toshiaki: *smells Bob's armpits, then smells Edgar's feet* Ugh, I'm going to be sick. What did you step in, Edgar? Edgar: I may or may not have accidentally stepped in Sparky's poop on the way here… Sparky: You say that like it's my fault. Mina: You wiped it off before you came in, right? O.O Edgar: Yeah. Mina: Oh, good. Next one's from Simbasson. Victor I dare you to dance to party rock in front of your parents Victor: In front of my parents? Wait, but I don't know how to— *is transported back home* …dance. Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein: *are sitting peacefully on the couch watching a movie that is nowhere near as strange as this fanfic* Mr. Frankenstein: *pauses movie and turns around* Hey, Victor! Mrs. Frankenstein: Oh, hi dear! Back so soon? Victor: Uhh…hi Mom, hi Dad… \"Party Rock Anthem\": *plays* Mrs. Frankenstein: o.0 Where's that music coming from? Victor: *tries to dance* Mrs. Frankenstein: Um, Victor? Victor: Yes? Mrs. Frankenstein: What are you doing? Victor: Dancing. Mrs. Frankenstein: That's, um, nice… Victor: *is transported back to Truth or Dare room* Mr. Frankenstein: Uh…where'd he go? Edgar I dare you to start breakdancing at an awkward moment Edgar:… All:… Edgar: *breakdances* Mina: That works. Toshie (sorry I can't spell your name.) Toshiaki: It's Toshiaki. I dare you to lick the floor 10 times Toshiaki: Ok then…*crouches down* Ew, the floor's all dirty! Mina: Um, yeah, I didn't get a chance to clean it yet. Toshiaki: I seriously going to throw up after this. *licks floor 10 times* *runs to sink* Bob I dare you to dance the tango with victor Bob: Okaaay? Tango music: *plays* Bob: *dances with Victor, and finishes off with a dip* Mina: Bravo. Next, a dare for Elsa… Elsa I dare you to act likes bunny Elsa: *hops around and eats random carrot* Weird girl (I love your name:) Weird Girl: Thank you! I dare you to do a staring contest with Nassor. Weird Girl: Easy. *stares* Nassor: *stares back*… *1 Minute Later* Nassor: Ow… must…not…blink…! Nassor's eyes: *are red and watering* Weird Girl's eyes: *are fine* Mina: Ok, you can stop now. Weird Girl wins. Nassor: *closes his eyes* Oh my eyes… All I dare you to dance to hamster dance :D Hamster Dance Song: *plays* All: *dance in fast motion* All truth what is your favorite animal, color, and sonic character? Mina: Ok, hold on. Do you guys know what Sonic is? Toshiaki: Just me…my favorite character is Tails. Oh, and my favorite animal is a turtle, and I like the color green. Mina: Oh, okay…I guess the rest of you can just state your favorite animal and color. Victor: I like dogs, but…my favorite color? Hm, I actually haven't really thought of that before. Maybe green, since it reminds me of nature. *high fives Toshiaki* Elsa: My favorite animal is a dog, and my favorite color is purple. Edgar: I don't have a favorite animal, but I do really like animals like bats, lizards, rats, and snakes. My favorite color would be…orange! Not a lot of people like orange… Weird Girl: I like cats and pastel colors, especially pink and yellow. Bob: My favorite animals are pandas, since they like to eat. And I like blue. Nassor: A hamster, and the color black. Mina: I like all animals, actually. And my favorite color is purple. This is the best fanfic EVER good luck to all of you;) TMH Mina: Thank you. Next up, Lordturrets! Weird girl I am so sorry about what happed to mr whiskers. I know how it feels to lose a pet. I had a dog named Roxie. she was the love of my life. the best dog ever in my point of view. she was their when I got bullied, hurt from friends and lonely. she was taken away from me by my parents. they claimed she was aggressive but she was really just overprotective over me. they took her to the pound and it ripped my heart in half. She was a pointer pit bull mix and very playful. Whenever I think about her I feel this fiery rage where my heart used to be. I have clawed holes in solid wood with anger. I promised her I would be their for her and I broke my promise. Now she is in a pound. I miss her so much. This may sound weird but every year on the day she left me I howl to the moon for her and remember when her and I would sit up on a hill and I would talk to her. But just remember mr whiskers remembers you just as I remember Roxie. ;) E B Weird Girl: Aww, thanks! I'm sorry about Roxie. Apparently, I'm more of a cat person, but Roxie sounds just as lovable as Mr. Whiskers. Mina: Next, Shinigamilover2. First of all, thank you guys so much for using my dares and one truth! I've got some new ones for ya! Mina: Cool, let's hear them. Oh, and Victor,'The Crow' is a movie about a guy who is resurrected from the dead to get revenge against the men who killed him and his girlfriend when they were to be married on Halloween night. Victor: Oh. Well, that sounds interesting…and violent… Victor: I dare you to dance to 'Dragula' by Rob Zombie in front of everyone in JUST your underwear Victor: Aw, what? Why do people like seeing me in my underwear? Nassor: Well, at least you don't have to take your underwear off … All: *shudder* Victor: *sighs* Fine. But I don't know how to dance! Elsa: You did the tango pretty well… Victor: I was just following Bob's lead. Mina: Just do your best. Victor: All right… *runs to corner and strips down to his underwear* Gah, I feel so exposed… \"Dragula\": *plays* Victor: *dances—or at least, tries to* *About 3 Minutes Later* Victor: *hurriedly puts clothes back on* Victor & Edgar: I dare you to play 'Slender' Victor and Edgar: \"Slender\"? Mina: You know, the Slenderman game? It's where you explore this forest, try to avoid Slenderman, and collect the eight pages. Try it! *computer appears* Victor: Doesn't sound that bad. Mina: It's really creepy. Oh, and you always lose, no matter what. Edgar: That really sucks. Whatever, let's just do this. Victor: *starts playing* We only get a flashlight? That does suck. Ok, let's figure out how this works. Let's look around first… Edgar: I see a dark forest. Oh, hey, I think I see a piece of paper! Mina: Left-click to pick it up. *explains other controls* Edgar: All right, let's find the second piece. Man, can't this person walk any faster? *punches shift key* Victor: Wait! What are you doing?! We're losing stamina—oh, great, now look what you did. Now we have to walk even slower! Edgar: Whatever. Let's go deeper into the woods. Victor: See anything? Edgar: No…let's try going to the right. Are you scared yet? Victor: Meh. Zoom in, I think I see something… *A Few Minutes Later* Victor: All right, well, we found four of the papers already! And we still haven't seen Slenderman, so that's a good sign. Slenderman: *appears* Freaky Game Over Screen: *also appears* Victor: Oh. Edgar: Nice going, jinx. Victor: Ok, how is this my fault? Besides, we were going to die anyway. Mina: Um…you guys seriously didn't find this game creepy at all? Victor: Hey, you're talking to someone who dug up a dead dog and brought it back to life. Mina: True, that. Moving on! Now here's a comment, even since I saw the movie and saw how much Victor and I have in common, I always wished I could have him as a little brother. Victor: Cool. I've always wanted to have a brother! Mina: Next up…SamApeace! Great chapter! Mina: Thank you… I got a few truths and dares Nassor and Toshiaki: On a scale of 1-10 how competative are u guys? Nassor and Toshiaki: 20. Toshiaki: *glares* 2 1 . Nassor: *glares back* 2 2 . Toshiaki: 2 3 . Nassor: 2 4 . Toshiaki: 2— Victor: If Elsa ever died, would you bring her back to life, or kill yourself to join her Victor: Definitely bring her back to life! I don't want to die yet…there's just so much I want to do and learn. Everyone: I dare you all to play slender Victor: Again? Well, all right. Maybe we can find all eight papers this time. Nassor: Ok, but I'm in charge for this game. Toshiaki: You ? You probably only last a few seconds! Nassor: Says the person who would die before the game even started. Toshiaki: That not even possible! Victor: Yeah, I'll just lead. Ok, which direction do you guys want to go? Nassor: Left. Toshiaki: *simultaneously* Right. Edgar: Just go forward. *Five Minutes Later* Toshiaki: Just give me the freaking keyboard! *grabs it* Victor: Wait! Nassor: Hey, I should've been leader, since I called it first! Elsa: Wait! I see Slenderman! Quick, guys, go left! Toshiaki: *presses random key* Elsa: No, that's forward! Toshiaki: Well, how I supposed to know? Victor: *facepalm* Nassor: Oh, crap, the sanity level is decreasing! Toshiaki: Fine, fine! What do I do? *presses another random key* Victor: No! What are you doing ? Toshiaki: I trying to run away—oops. Victor: *headdesk* Game Over Screen: *appears* Nassor: See? This wouldn't have happened if I had been leader. Toshiaki: We would have died earlier if you been leader. Elsa: Guys! Quit arguing! Bob: Well, that was…eventful. Mina: You said it. Moving on! Everyone: I dare u all (including Zinka17) to do a flash mob Mina: Well, at least it's not another Slender dare. *transports everyone to New Holland town center* All: *randomly break out into dancing (or attempts at dancing, in some cases)* Innocent Passers-by: o.0 Elsa: *turns red* Oh crap, it's my uncle! Mayor Burgemeister: Hey! What are these kids doing here? Wait…Elsa?! What on earth are you— Mina: *quickly transports everyone back* Okay! Our next review is from ninaspringfield1134. Oh…sorry, Toshiaki and Nassor, I think you guys have to leave for a bit. Toshiaki: Why? Mina: Don't worry. I think you'll actually like this…well, at least while it lasts. Nassor: Okay… Toshiaki and Nassor: *leave* Dare for To-to and Nass (but they can't know it) no doing kiss the other dares but make up for them the next chapter Victor: Oh… Edgar: What? Why do we have to wait until the next chapter? I love watching Toshiaki and Nassor being tortured! Mina: You're so nice. Ok, you guys can come back in now! Nassor: What was that all about? Mina: You'll see. In the next chapter… Dare for all couples*plus Elsa and Victor* stay back to back for the whole chapter(with necessary exceptions) don't worry Bob I scare a lot of people Teachers upper class men friends cousins...no wait I crack their backs. you get a lot of shounen-ai Dares for To-to and Nass. Toshiaki: Did she just call me To-to ? Nassor: Uh…when she says \"couples\", does that include Toshiaki and me? Mina: I would assume so! All couples: *go back-to-back* Toshiaki: This feel so awkward. Mina: I can tell. Here's a review from Energy witch. This looks like fun! I think I'll try it for fun! Mina: Yeah, it's pretty fun. Truth: -(BE HONEST) Do your parents know what you four did on dutch day? Because since you copied Victor's experiment that's considered cheating. Nassor: Of course! After Shelley, the sea monkeys, the vampire cat, and the giant rat completely ruined Dutch Day, the mayor made all of us confess about what had happened. Then he told all of our parents… Toshiaki: I never seen my parents so angry before. It definitely scary. Nassor: Moral of the story? Don't cheat, kids. -What is the one thing that scares you in anything in the world, ya know if you were to face boggart (shapeshifter that turns into a persons fear) what would it be? Victor: Losing Sparky again permanently, and having to watch him die. Elsa: Clowns, I guess. They're so creepy. Toshiaki: I afraid of failure. I can't stand losing! Weird Girl: I'm kinda afraid of the dark—like, total pitch-blackness. That's why I keep my eyes wide open all the time, so I can let in as much light as possible. Edgar: I have a fear of abandonment, since I hate being alone. Nassor: Well…after the Dutch Day incident…I may have developed a, um, fear of turtles. Bob: I'm afraid of starvation, exercise, and, well, of course, sea monkeys. - How would you go if you found out that you got a secret admirer (the genuine kind) that's none of your current crushes? Victor: I'd rather not, actually. I mean, the last thing I want is girls fighting over me. It makes me feel so…pressured. Elsa: Well, as long as they're ok with being just friends, I guess that would be fine. Toshiaki: I don't really care. I kinda used to it… Nassor: Same as Toshiaki. Edgar: Same as Elsa's response. I mean, it's nice being liked and all, but I don't want anyone coming between Harriet and me! Weird Girl: Me too. Bob: I think it would be pretty awesome. -Any of you into adventure mysteries? Nassor: I rather like them, myself. I enjoy reading books with a lot of action and suspense. Dare: Victor: -Pet/hold a Spectral bat aka False Vampire bat (the type Goth and Throbb are from Silverwing) or hold a bird of prey(owl or hawk) on your arm. Mina: Oh hey, someone else who read the Silverwing books? Awesome. So, what'll it be, Victor? Victor: Um…I guess the bat sounds pretty cool. Mina: Aw yeah. Spectral bat: *appears hanging from a random pole* Victor: Whoa, it's so…big. *pets it* Yes! Now I can tell people that I petted a bat! Toshiaki and Nassor : Since we never seen neither you guys smile naturally, I dare you tickle each other for long while to explore your vulnerabilities to know where you most tickilish. Toshiaki: What you mean you never seen me smile naturally? I did smile in the movie! Mina: Guess people wouldn't consider that as a real smile. Nassor: Do we have to do it back-to-back? That's really awkward… Mina: Try your best. Nassor: Um, all right then… Toshiaki and Nassor: *tentatively attempt to tickle each other* Toshiaki: Yeah, this really awkw—*bursts out laughing* Ok, ok, stop! Your turn. Nassor: Ok, but I should let you know that I'm not very tickli—*laughs* Never mind. Mina: Now here's a review from Whiteling. Truth- Weird girl: Hope this isn't cruel of me, but do you know if Mr. Whiskers fathered any kittens? Weird Girl: Last I checked, no… Boys: Would you sneak into a scary or R rated movie if you had a chance? Toshiaki: Why not? Victor: I wouldn't. My parents would kill me! Nassor: Depends on how good the movie is. Bob: Depends on how…inappropriate…it is. Dare *Toshiaki: Recite with one of the girls some lines from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet Mina: Who wants to be Juliet? Weird Girl: … Elsa: … Mina: …Harriet! Thank you for volunteering. Weird Girl: Wait, what? Mina: *gives Toshiaki and Weird Girl the script* This is the part when Romeo and Juliet first meet. Toshiaki: o.0 What does this stuff even mean ? Mina: Just read it! Toshiaki: Fine… \" If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .\" Weird Girl: \"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this, For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\" *blank look* I am so confused right now… Mina: It's ok. I didn't really get it when I first read it, either…basically, during this scene, Romeo was trying to convince Juliet to kiss him by using a bunch of religious metaphors. * Elsa: Kiss a peacock on its head or beak. Elsa: That's…an interesting dare. Peacock: *appears* Elsa: Yeah, I'll just kiss it on its head. The beak looks…dangerous. *kisses the peacock's head* Peacock: *squawks angrily* *disappears* Mina: Now for a rather violent request from finalefighter6. *DEVIL LIKE VOICE* alright NOW LISTEN everyone i want all of you to light your hair on fire AND I'm not talking like a little bit on fire i mean A LOT*yelling at top of lungs* FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN GRAVE PUNISHMENTS FOR ALL OF YOU sorry for being so mean i just like watching people suffer :-D Mina: Just saying, but wouldn't lighting your hair a little bit on fire be the same as lighting it a lot? You know, because fire spreads quickly? Oh, well. Let's do this, guys. All: WHAT?! Victor: You're serious? We're not going to light ourselves on fire! That's suicide… Mina: Um, maybe we can just light up one strand. I mean, finalefighter6 didn't say ALL of our hair… Fireplace with blazing fire: *appears* All: *drop one strand of hair each into the fire and watch the strands burn* Mina: Well, that was certainly a dangerous and exhilarating experience. Now for a review from The Butterfly. Oh these people are horrible! Poor Nassor and Toshiaki. I feel really bad for them. Toshiaki: FINALLY! Someone who understands our pain and misery! Don't people get enough of them kissing already? Doesn't it get old after a while? Well, I'll do something about it. Nassor & Toshiaki: Don't kiss at all for the rest of this chapter, no matter what any dare says. Nassor and Toshiaki: YES! Weird Girl: Have you ever thought about getting another cat? Perhaps a Mr. Whiskers II. Weird Girl: I considered it a few times, but I'm not sure I'm ready to…well…move on. Mr. Whiskers was really special to me, so getting another cat just wouldn't be the same. Edgar: You mentioned that you like the movie Igor for obvious reasons. Is the main Igor in that movie related to you? Edgar: I don't think so. Our similarities are just coincidental, I guess. Zinka17: Do you regret writing this Truth or Dare? People are swarming you with reviews! It must be exhausting. Mina: I'll answer for Zinka, since she's not here. Yes. It is very exhausting. But it's fun, too, so…:) Ok, next is SJK09. Yay! You're back! Just a random question for everyone. What's your favorite music type/genre? Victor: I would have to say classical. It's very calming to listen to, especially when I'm working. Elsa: Hmm…I kind of like rock and pop music. Nassor: I myself also like a bit of rock music. And Dubstep, I guess. Weird Girl: I like classical, like Victor does. It's very pretty. Toshiaki: My favorite is Asian music, especially J-pop and J-rock. Edgar: …um. Mina: Uh, Edgar? Edgar: Yes? Mina: Aren't you going to…answer the question? Edgar: …Oh, fine. I like country music. Victor: You do ?! Edgar: You don't need to sound so horrified! Victor: I'm not. It's just that you never really struck me as the type of person who likes country music… Edgar: Oh. Well, I am. Bob: You don't have to be embarrassed, E. I like country music, too. Edgar: Oh… Mina: As for me…I actually don't listen to music that much, but I guess I like pop, and a little bit of K-pop. 2NE1 is my favorite! Oh, and I like Christian music. Next, AnotherGuest. Hi there. Thank you for doing \"What I Was Born to Do\". Now I dare you guys to do \"Cross the Line\" from; yes, Bring it On The Musical. I'm hoping for some good dancing. Victor: Um, yeah, not sure I can guarantee that. How do we know who we are unless we cross the line? How do we know who we are unless we cross the line? How do we know who we are unless we cross the line? How do we know who we are unless we cross the line? When we were young and unafraid We'd climb the highest wall we could find When we were young and unafraid We'd draw a line in the sand just to cross it We'd fall just to feel alive We knew we would be a right I wanna fall just to feel alive I feel like following me tonight - How do we know who we are Unless we cross the line?

Get ready for Jackson! Go Jackson! Go Jackson! Go Jackson! Go! Go! Go! Go! And a truth: Toshiaki, tell me more about Emi. I understand she's cute, but is she smart? Is she athletic? Does she even acknowledge your existence? Toshiaki: *smiles and blushes* Yeah, she actually really smart! Not that athletic, but she very sweet and friendly to everyone. As for your third question, yes, she know I exist, but we never actually have a real conversation. She sometimes did try to talk to me, but I was always too embarrassed to reply… Mina: Aww, Toshi! Toshiaki: Don't call me Toshi. Mina: Up next is elsavonhelsing… (yes Elsa i purposely misspelled your name and made it my username. live with it!) Elsa: Um, okay… Harreit: What's your life like at home? Just saying, because I wrote a fanfiction where your name is Fena Van Dort and you live with your nineteen year old sister named Lilane, You and Lilane are orphans and desendants of Victor Van Dort, you even have a doll you and Lilane made look like Emily. Weird Girl: Well, it's very quiet at my house. I actually live alone with my mother, who is mostly at work. I don't have a sister, since I'm an only child, but I do wish I had one! It gets very lonely. P.S. No ofense Elsa but Victor, I love you Victor: *blushes* Uh…thanks, I guess. Mina: So many fangirls! Anyway, here's flowerpower71's review. Hahahaha! I loved this chapter! This is exactly what I needed after my day... XD And thank you for all the nice things you said about my story. :3 Mina: Zinka says you're welcome. Anywho onto the Truths and dares *smiles evily* Edgar: I dare you to dress up in a chicken suit and run around the neighborhood shouting, \"I LIKE TACOS! I LIKE TACOS! I LIKE TACOS!\" at the top of your lungs. Edgar: *is dressed like a chicken* Toshiaki: Haha! You look ridiculous! Edgar: Hey! Weird Girl: I think you make a very cute chicken, Edgar. Edgar: Oh…*blushes*…thanks, Harriet! *is transported outside* Okay. I can do this. *runs around* I LIKE TACOS! I LIKE TACOS! I LIKE TACOS! I LIKE TACOS! *is transported back inside* Mina: Thank you, Edgar. Edgar: Ughhh… Nessor: Alright, tell the truth. Whose your favorite Disney princess? ;) Nassor: I believe you mean \"N a ssor\". Hmm…I would have to say Belle, since I'm most like her. She's smart, serious, and loves to read. Toshi: I dare you to go to a crowded place (Not school) and start dancing gangnam style. You have to wear a tux, bow-tie and sunglasses and everything. Toshiaki: Don't. Call. Me. Toshi. And do I have to?! Ever since I had to do that dare at school, I hated Gangnam Style! Mina: You are what you hate. Toshiaki: *is dressed in tux, bow-tie, and dark sunglasses* Ugghhh. *transported to crowded fancy restaurant* Why a restaurant? Mina: Um…I like food. Bob: Yeah! *high-fives Mina* \"Gangnam Style\": *plays loudly* Random Customers: What the… Toshiaki: *dances* All Except For \"Gangnam Style\": *is awkwardly silent* Restaurant Worker: *to Toshiaki* Excuse me, sir, but I'm afraid you'll have to leave. You're disturbing the customers. Toshiaki: *still dancing* But I can't stop! I was dared to! Worker: Dare or not, I'm going to have to tell the manager if you don't stop. Toshiaki: * still dancing* No! Wait! Auuggghhh, when is this stupid song going to END? *is transported back* I am so going to kill whoever made this dare… Mina: Oh, don't be so mean. At least you didn't actually get in trouble. Plus, you're wearing sunglasses, so no one really recognized you. Toshiaki: Oh. Right. Well, it still embarrassing! And can I wear my normal clothes now? Mina: Hmmm…naaaahhh. You look cute like that! Toshiaki: No! Wait, did you just say I— Also I have a questions for you. How would you feel if you got the opportunity to see Emi again? (BTW Zinka, YES! Write that fic! I would so read it!) Toshiaki: *blushes* Um, well…I-I don't know… Edgar: He would probably pee his pants. Then faint. Nassor: *hides smile* Toshiaki: Hey! Mina: You probably would, though…Oh hey, check out this next question. Zinka: Is it possible for you to trasnport Emi there so she and Toshi could see each other again? Mina: Can do! Emi: *appears* *speech translated to English* Uhhh…Where am I? Mina: Truth or Dare: Frankenweenie Style. It's a fanfic. Emi: Is that…Toshiaki? Toshiaki: *stammers and blushes* Uh…uh…hey, Emi… Mina: How cute! I think we should give you two some alone time. Toshiaki: W-Wait! All except Toshiaki and Emi: *disappear into another room* Victor: Have you ever met Victor from Corpse Bride? Also are you related to THE actual Dr. Frankenstein? (you know cause of your name) Victor: No, I haven't met him yet. That would be pretty interesting if we did meet, though… And for your second question, I'm not really sure, but it definitely seems like it! I'll have to ask my parents. I'd write more but my laptop is dying. I shall return with more evil TorD's soon! Mwahahaha! Mina: Yay. Next is…snowpelt97! Victor: I dare you to drink a bucket full of salt water without spitting it out Bucket full of salt water: *appears* Victor: Oh, God, I'm going to regret this. *picks up bucket and drinks it* *5 Minutes Later* Victor: WATER! *runs to sink and drinks from faucet* Mina: Next is X. Well victor...you may of been able to find a way out of my dare...BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE A DARE FOR YOU! Victor: Oh boy. Mina: *reads review* Looks like Elsa will have to leave the room for this one. Elsa: That doesn't sound very promising… *leaves* victor: (Elsa can't hear the dare) You have 2 A) Tell Elsa that she is the ugliest person you have ever met and that YOU NEVER LOVED HER! or B) never talk to elsa AGAIN FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!... Talk or be silent... make your choice. Victor: WHAT?! Bu—but…I…no! I can't… Mina: Well, make up your mind soon. Elsa, you can come back in now. Elsa: I'm nervous… Everyone except Elsa and Victor: *looks at Victor* Victor: Uh…Elsa…I have something to tell you… Elsa: Uh-huh? Victor: Um…uh…Y-You are the…the…u-ugliest person I've ever met and I-I… never loved you. Th-There! I said it! All: … Elsa: It's ok, Victor. I don't believe you. Victor: Oh, good. *sighs in relief* Mina: Well, that was anticlimactic. Edgar: Don't kiss Weird Girl for another chapter (i know im evil). Edgar: Wait, \"another chapter\"? Does that mean I can't kiss her for the rest of the fic? Mina: Judging by the cruelty of this reviewer, I would think so. Weird Girl: What?! Edgar: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! How do I SURVIVE?! Victor: By…breathing? Remember that failure to complete a dare or to answer a question honestly will lead to a worst dare or question. Mina: That's nice. Next up is Guest. truth for victor: what was the first thing you thought of when you found out that Edgar knew about sparky? Victor: I was horrified! All I could think was how ? How did he find out? Edgar: I saw him at the school. Victor: Wait, what? But…I left him at home! Edgar: *shrugs* He must have escaped somehow. All I know is that I saw him. And that he was… alive . Mina: Next is Corpsebridelover. Omg lol that was funny. Toshi I'm sorry that you hurt your arm Mina: Oh, yeah, we should probably get back to Toshiaki and Emi… All: *go back into main room* Toshiaki and Emi: *are talking and laughing* Mina: Aww, they look so cute together! Edgar: I think it's weird seeing Toshiaki like that. Toshiaki: *looks up* What you guys doing here? Mina: Sorry, guys, but I'm going to have to interrupt for a bit. Emi, you ready to go back? Toshiaki and Emi: Aww! Emi: Sorry, Toshi, I probably should go back now. My parents will be wondering where I am. It was nice talking with you, though! Toshiaki: You too… Edgar: Why is only she allowed to call you Toshi? Emi: *disappears* Toshiaki: *smiles and sighs* Mina: Looks like you guys had a good time. Toshiaki: Yeah… Mina: Did you kiss? Toshiaki: NO! Mina: Ok, ok. Well, Corpsebridelover has something to say to you. Toshi I'm sorry that you hurt your arm Toshiaki: It ok. And don't call me Toshi. Edgar: Seriously, why is only Emi allowed to call you that? and victor I could tell that you would be that way on a sugar Victor: Yeah… I have a dare for Nassor. run around the room screaming about pandas wanting to eat your face wile eating a candy bar. Nassor: That is a…rather interesting dare. I don't have to do it back-to-back with Toshiaki, do I? Mina: No. I mean, you can try, but that would be pretty difficult. Do you have a candy bar preference? Nassor: I'll go with a dark chocolate Hershey's bar. Mina: Awesome. Nassor's request: *is granted* Mina: All right, Nassor, do your thing! Nassor: Oh, dear God. *unwraps chocolate bar, starts eating it, and runs around room* Uh...PANDAS WANT TO EAT MY FACE! AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY! A PANDA'S DIET CONSISTS OF PLANTS (ESPECIALLY BAMBOO), BIRDS, RODENTS, AND CARRION! AND LAST I CHECKED, I AM NONE OF THOSE THINGS! AND I AM GOING TO CHOKE ON THIS CANDY BAR IF I KEEP THIS UP ANY LONGER! Mina: Ok, you can stop now. Nassor: Torture. Pure torture. *quietly eats chocolate* I have a few mor dares Bob I dare you to kiss Edgar on the lips Weird Girl: *frowns* Bob: Ugghhh. *kisses Edgar on the lips, then runs to sink with toothbrush* Edgar: *brushes his teeth as well* Elsa I dare you to kiss Victor for 3 minutes :) Elsa: Yes! *kisses Victor for 3 minutes, no less* Victor: *blushes* I'll never get tired of doing that dare! Victor I dare you to hang out with victor van Dort for the whole chapter witch zinka will make appear :) Victor: Awesome! I've always wanted to meet him. Victor van Dort: *appears* Um…where am I? Mina: Welcome to Truth or Dare: Frankenweenie style. Make yourself comfortable; you'll be here for the rest of the chapter—which will be…according to my calculations…incredibly long. VvD: Frankenweenie? Isn't that a mov—waaaaiiit a is that? *stares at Victor* Victor: Hey. Mina: Victor, meet Victor. Oh, and that's Elsa, Weird Girl, Edgar, Bob, Toshiaki, and Nassor… VvD: *to Victor* Oh…I think I've heard of you before…you're the main character in this…Frankenweenie movie, right? Victor…Frankenstein? Victor: That's me. And you're from Corpse Bride? VvD: Um, yes. Everyone's been saying how alike we are, and, well…now that I have the chance to see it for myself…wow. They were right. *awkward pause* So…what is this, exactly? Victor: It's a truth or dare fic. So the people reading this submit stuff they want the characters to do or say, and then we…well…do it. VvD: O…kay…Why are six of you back-to-back? Elsa: Oh, it was a dare. Weird girl I dare you to kiss Edgar on the lips for as long as you want VvD: Kissing? But you guys are only kids! Edgar: Oh, we're not that young. Weird Girl: Yeah. Oh wait…I can't kiss Edgar…that other dare said we couldn't. Edgar: Gah! Can't we just kiss one more time? Mina: Sorry, guys! Toshi dance to I'm sexy and I know it VvD: What? Victor: It's a song. Oh, and Toshiaki hates being called Toshi, so never call him that. VvD: I'll keep that in mind… Toshiaki: I have to dance to that song? Oh God… \"Sexy and I Know It\": *plays* Toshiaki: *dances in a very…exaggerated manner* VvD: O.O This is the best fanfic ever victor I could just hug you you are so adorable Victor and VvD: Thanks! Mina: I think she just meant Victor F. VvD: Oh. and if zinka made victor van dort appear I have a dare for him to VvD: I don't like the sound of this. Victor van dort I dare you to get really mad for no reason and turn in to a werewolf or else I will kidnap Victoria (evil smile) no getting out of it in any way at all VvD: What ? Who is this person? *is starting to get really mad* How dare they threaten Victoria! *turns into werewolf* Victor: Whoa, I didn't think that would actually happen… Mina: That's the power of fanfiction! And of love, I guess. Victor: Strange love. Mina: Ohhh, I see what you did there. :D Victor: What? Mina: You know, the song in the ending credits for Frankenweenie ? VvD: *vicious growl* Victor: Um, we should probably change him back before he kills somebody. VvD: *is back to normal* What exactly just happened? Mina: You completed the dare. VvD: Oh. Ok, well, I'm just glad that crazy reviewer is going to leave Victoria alone…I hope. Mina: So do we. Anyway. This review is from Registered2Comment. WELL, that was certainly another fun (and extremely long and hilarious and insane) session of ToD! Oh, man, you guys have got to watch My Little Pony! ;D (In fact, I DARE you to watch the entire series after the game is over!) And sorry, I forgot that I should probably keep the dares more, eh, G-rated. And I shall try to refrain from embarrassing the painfully adorable (and handsome, hehe) Nassor any further. Sorta. 3 His and Toshi's ability to attract the ladies is just so uncanny... Mina: Girls tend to like bad boys, haha. :P *ahem* Great job accomplishing most of those crazy dares, too, everyone. All: Yeah! Well, except for the Tarzan poster fail-darn! Niiice outsmarting on some of them, though. Especially the 30-minute makeout. You go, guys. xD Sorry you had to miss out on the party, though. And good work, Sparky! ;] Burgemeister suffered quite a bit that round, too. And poor Bob. Too much exercise'll kill ya! .; Bob: I KNOW, right?! Who needs exercise, anyway? I mean, it wastes so much energy! I LOVE musicals, so hearing you guys sing was a treat. Mina: Yeah, you guys are so talented! Whoa, random idea. Maybe y'all could do, like, a musical version of Frankenweenie ! All: Uh… Edgar: No . Ah, Victor, I thought you might be a descendant of Van Dort. ;) But the resemblances could just be coincidence. Victor and VvD: A huge coincidence. I KNEW THE PRINCESSES WERE ALL REAL, TOO. *u* Ooh, I love Medusa! I actually found the wooden coaster at Six Flags kinda painful, the way it jerked us around. xD Superman, too. But I've gone on Medusa a few times. And I haaaate forgetting my lines. It's like, \"Urgh, this should so not be happening to me of all people, why am I blanking?!\" Hunh, no wonder Toshiaki is named Toshiaki! XD I find clowns freaky too, Elsa. ;) Elsa: Yes! Someone who understands my fear! Beautiful serenade...! And LatT moment. ;u; I notice Zinka didn't magically gift Edgar & Harriet with excellent Tango-ing abilty for THEIR dare, though, lol. Edgar: Oh, yeah… Okay, so I guess that was way more than enough commentary. Even though I could blather on forever...on to a few actual QUESTIONS/DARES! Questions: Persephone and Sparky...how did you guys come to live with Elsa and Victor? Have you or your masters ever considered competing in any dog sports (e.g., shows or Agility?) Persephone: Elsa adopted me from an animal shelter. It took me a while to get used to her—since I was afraid of humans at the time—but she was always very nice and caring. For your second question, I would want to enter a dog show. Sparky: I was adopted, too, except from a different animal shelter. Ah…one the most memorable moments of my life. When I first saw Victor, I thought he seemed very kind and gentle. Sure enough, he was. Oh, and I would love to compete in dog sports! Sounds like fun! Kids I. Do any of you have siblings? If so, what are the natures of your relationships with them? Elsa: Well, I did have an older sister named Emma, but she passed away a while ago. *sighs* We were really close, and I miss her a lot. Victor: *hugs Elsa* Aww, I'm sorry. Elsa: *smiles sadly* It's not your fault. Um, anyway, what's the next truth or dare? II. What other kinds of animals would you most want to have? Victor: Maybe more dogs. Elsa: Same as Victor, though I would probably want a toy breed. I guess I would want a cat as well. Toshiaki: A turtle is good enough for me. My mom want to get a fluffy white dog, though. Nassor: Hm…I rather like cats. And reptiles, like snakes or lizards. Weird Girl: I've always liked birds and mice, since they're small and cute, but I never got any, because, you know, Mr. Whiskers. Edgar: A fish! An invisible one would be even better. Bob: Yeah, anything small, like a fish or hamster. Dares: Elsa, Weird Girl, & Victor: Jump rope while completing your next five questions/dares (including my questions, I guess...although the dare won't really work with it.) Three jump ropes: *appear* Elsa: So we don't have to do this dare back-to-back, right? Mina: Um…no. Bob, Nassor, Toshiaki, & Edgar: Same, but hula-hoop! Four hula-hoops: *appear* Bob: Aw, but I hate exercising! Mina: Hula-hooping isn't that strenuous. I'm sure you can manage. Bob: All right… Then if there's enough time, I want all of you to go to a large furniture store (such as IKEA), hide somewhere so that you get locked in overnight, and have a fabulous sleepover party there! Mina: Sounds cool. You guys don't have to do it while jump-roping/hula-hooping, though… Victor: Do we still have to be back-to-back? Mina: Well, we've already made a ton of exceptions, so for this dare, yes. All: *transported to New Holland Furniture Store (yeah, real creative names, huh?)* Victor: It's so dark…guess it's closed already. Man, how long have we been playing Truth or Dare? Mina: Time doesn't really matter anymore in fics like this one. Um…where's the light switch? Lights: *are turned on* Edgar: Found it. Mina: All right, we should probably start before it's too late. What kind of food do you guys want? Bob: Cake! Oh, and ice cream. And cookies. Sparky and Persephone: Dog biscuits! Food Requests: *are granted* Mina: Actually, before we start eating, we should probably finish the next 5 truths/dares first, since you guys still need to do that jump-roping/hula-hooping thing. 'Til next time, then (I still have more evil-err, fun ideas saved!)... xOxOxO Reggie Mina: Next review is from Derpfish. Lol this is so funny! But I think you should take it down on the kissing, just saying! :3 Victor: Why? What's wrong with it? oh and I dare Elsa to put her hair down (I'm just curious) Elsa: Um, ok. Sure. *stops jumping rope to undo pigtails* Elsa's hair: *flows in the breeze, shampoo commercial-style* Victor: Whoa . O.O Weird Girl: You look really pretty like that, Elsa! You should do it more often, if you want. Elsa: *blushes* Thanks, Harriet. I've never worn my hair down in public before…makes me feel kinda awkward right now. Mina: Aww. Harriet's right, though, you look really nice. Next one is from Sally. make nassor and toshiaki fight and the kiss and make up Nassor: I think I'll enjoy the fighting part, but the kissing? Toshiaki: Wait, aren't we not supposed to kiss for the rest of the chapter? Mina: I guess you could just skip that part. But you still have to make-up afterwards! Toshiaki: Oh ok. Um…do we have to fight while hula-hooping? Mina: I think you can manage. Somehow. Edgar: Ooh, I'm going to enjoy this! Fight! Fight! Fight! Nassor: This is knocking me out with a baseball! *punches Toshiaki* Toshiaki: You're STILL angry about that? That happened, like, a long time ago! *throws himself at Nassor* Fight: *ensues* Mina: All right, I think that's enough for now. Edgar: No! Mina: What, you want them to kill each other? Ok, you guys have to make up now. Toshiaki and Nassor: *are lying on ground* Toshiaki: *winces in pain* Ow…fine…sorry, Nassor. Ow. Nassor: Sorry… Toshiaki. Mina: Next is iluvBrickMcArther. Yes it was nice meeting you, toshi. Toshiaki: Thanks. Don't call me Toshi. And nassor I like you for your personality. Nassor: Thank you. Toshiaki: What personality? Mina: Don't start! And toshi, sorry. I am a major hugger. Toshiaki: Meh, it ok. Alright. Dare for toshi and nassor. I dare you two to sing a duet of the song dimentia by owl city. Toshiaki and Nassor: *groan* Toshiaki: Can we not? Mina: It doesn't require that much energy to sing. Nassor: Oh, all right. Dementia, you're driving me crazy This is driving me crazy, Dementia, dementia Toshiaki: Every light in the night flickered in and out Every bone in my back shivered up and down Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies 'Cause this is driving me crazy Nassor: Every voice in my head shouted 'yes' and 'no' Every freight train of thought fought to stop and go Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies 'Cause this is driving me crazy Toshiaki: Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night This is love, this is war, it's insanity Dementia, you're driving me crazy Nassor: Dementia, you're driving me crazy, This is driving me crazy Toshiaki: Every tear in my eyes dripped and wouldn't drop Every disc in my spine shook and couldn't stop Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies 'Cause this is driving me crazy Nassor: Every hand let me go that I tried to hold Every warm-hearted love left me freezing cold Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies 'Cause this is driving me crazy Toshiaki: Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night This is love, this is war, it's insanity Dementia, you're driving me crazy Nassor: Dementia, you're driving me crazy Dementia, you're driving me crazy Toshiaki: This is driving me crazy Nassor: You're driving me crazy 'Cause this is driving me crazy Toshiaki: Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night This is love, this is war, it's insanity Dementia, dementia Nassor: Through the skies you're en route at the speed of light So realize there's chaos in the air tonight This is love, this is war, this is pure insanity Dementia, you're driving me crazy Toshiaki: This is driving me crazy Dementia, you're driving me crazy 'Cause this is driving me crazy Dementia, you're driving me crazy Nassor: This is driving me crazy This is driving me crazy This is driving me crazy Dementia, dementia Mina: Nice singing. Ok, this one's from Davinastorm. Greeting's this is a truth for bob(since he mostly get embarrassing dare's) how did you and Toshiaki become friends? :3 Bob: I met him after he immigrated here from Japan—which was about a few years ago. He was pretty lonely and all when he first came, so one day at school I decided to make friends with him. After I got to know him a bit, I saw he was really cool and smart and all. Toshiaki: :) Thanks, Bob. Bob: Can I stop hula-hooping now? I'm really tired! Mina: No, sorry. This one is from Iluvfrankenweenie2098! R u going to write a new chapter? I luv how made all of their personalities! Mina: Yes, Zinka did a really good job with the characters, huh? Oh, and yes, I will be writing a new chapter, if I get enough Truths/Dares. Here's something from Guest… I dare Elsa and Victor to make out for an hour ;D Victor: Whoa, an hour? Uh…we don't have to do it while jump roping, right? Mina: No. Victor: All right. Can we do it in private? Mina: Eh…sure. Elsa: Oh, good. Elsa and Victor: *leave* Edgar: Gah…why does there always have to be so much kissing? Mina: Just be glad you don't have to watch it. Besides, there actually hasn't been much kissing in this chapter—not as much as the other ones, anyway. *1 Hour Later* Elsa and Victor: *are blushing* Elsa: So, uh…did we miss anything? Mina: Not much. We just ate cookies and played Rock, Paper, Scissors. Toshiaki: Which you cheated at! Mina: Pshhh, no I didn't. Anyway, the next review is from awesomeness. i dare victor and elsa do go into the other room together and you an take it from there Victor: What are we supposed to do in the other room? Mina: Just do whatever. Victor and Elsa: *leave. Again.* *A Few Minutes Later* Toshiaki: What did you guys do in there? Victor: We just talked about life. Oh, and jumped rope. Nassor: That's all you did? Elsa: That's all we felt like doing, to be honest. Um…ok. Who's the next reviewer? Mina: That would be Jackie. YOU LIED! Mina: o.0 Did I miss something? JUST FLIM THEM IF THEY MAKE OUT FOR 3O MINS Mina: I think you mean \"film\"…? And who's \"them\"? Nassor: I think that would be Toshiaki and me…it was a dare we were supposed to do. Mina: Oh. Well, you guys aren't supposed to kiss, so…moving on! Sorry, maybe next chapter. Ok, the next reviewer is Anonymous. Thank you for using my dare! I'm so glad you used it! Okay, I have a dare for the entire group. Watch an hour of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, then say who their favourite character was. Don't worry Zinka, you don't need to watch, you can just look up the names. Keep updating! :D Mina: Ok. I've actually watched a few episodes of MLP:FiM before. It's pretty cute and funny. You guys will like it…probably. All: Hm… TV: *appears and plays My Little Pony* *1 Hour Later* Mina: So, what did you guys think? Oh, and say who your favorite character is! Mine's Fluttershy, btw. ^^ Edgar: Favorite character ? But I liked all of them! Victor: Uh…I like Spike the best. He's pretty funny! Elsa: I like Fluttershy, since we're both quiet and love animals. *high-fives Mina* Weird Girl: Applejack. She's really friendly and hardworking. Toshiaki: Rainbow Dash is pretty cool. Nassor: Twilight Sparkle—very (VERY) determined and intelligent. Bob: Um, this is kinda weird, but I like Pinkie Pie. She's really cheerful and funny and yeah…Oh, and her name has \"Pie\" in it. I love pie. Mina: Aw, don't be embarrassed about liking Pinkie Pie! A lot of people do. Ooh, by the way, Bob, you should really read that MLP:FiM fanfic \"Cupcakes\", since you like Pinkie Pie so much…heheh. Anyway. Oh, you guys can stop hula-hooping/jump roping now. All: *groan and sink to floor* Bob: Can we have food now? Mina: Yep, go ahead! Bob: Yay! *eats* Mina: Next reviewer, Registered2Comment! YES! Someone else echoes my pony dare! 33 Do it, y'all! We're just ever so curious...;} Mina: Haha! Well, we did, so…happy birthday. Next, Vampinator! I have an idea for Victor and Nassor I dare you both to reenact the lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan in star wars episode 3. Nassor will be Obi-wan kenobi Victor will be Anakin Skywalker (A.K.A. Darth Vader) Two Blue Lightsabers: *appear* Mina: Begin. *to the others* Might wanna stand back, guys. Elsa: Go Victor!

To Zinka17: thanks for using my dares Mina: You're welcome. Edgar: first, sorry about not being able to kiss the Weird Girl, and second, I dare you to take the Weird Girl on a date. Edgar: Will do! Where do you want to go, Harriet? Weird Girl: *blushes* It doesn't matter. Want to go to the New Holland Bistro? Edgar: Sure. Let's go! Bob: sorry about making you do 10 push, but seeing that you failed to complete it, I dare you to not eat any form of sweets for an entire week. Bob: NO JUNK FOOD? HOW WILL I SURVIVE ?! Mina: Calm down, Bob, you got this! Hide the sweets, guys! Bob: *sobs* Toshiaki: I dare you dance like a robot, while wearing a silver jumpsuit, large glittery square glass, a colorful necktie, florescent glove and Light-up rainbow shoes, to a song from the 80s or 90s, Zinka17 choice. Toshiaki: Uh, why? Mina: Because it's embarrassing. Well, I don't really know any 80s or 90s songs that you could dance like a robot to, so try this one. *plays \"Dancing Queen\"* Toshiaki: *is dressed in the fabulous outfit RandomEnigma requested* Is that seriously the only song you can think of? Mina: Haha. Dance, Toshi. Toshiaki: Did you just—fine. *dances like robot* *Minutes Later* Mina: Oh hey, Weird Girl and Edgar are back! Just in time, too… Weird Girl: I dare you to sit quietly for 3 minutes while sad violin music is playing Weird Girl: Um, ok. Why the sad violin music, though? Mina: Oh, blah. Just do it and we'll see what happens. Oh, and Toshiaki will be our violinist for today. Toshiaki: What? Why me? Mina: I made you a violinist in my other fanfic. You're extremely talented and have been playing for almost all your life. Now go! Play a song! And make it depressing! Toshiaki: *plays a sad song on a violin that has randomly appeared* Weird Girl: *sits quietly* *3 Minutes Later* Weird Girl: Wow. I actually feel kinda depressed right now. Mina: Then Toshiaki has done his job well. You can stop now, Toshiaki. Toshiaki: Ok. Mina: Our next review is from PunkRockBuster. Dare: Toshiaki, I dare you to wear a pink kimono, with matching wooden sandals, while wearing kabuki make-up for the rest of this chapter, that this dare is featured in. Toshiaki: Cross-dressing?! Edgar: Just do it! You'll look hilarious! Toshiaki: *grumbles* *is wearing requested outfit and makeup* This is so embarrassing! -.- Edgar, I dare you to slap yourself 15 times while saying \"stop slapping myself\" also for 15 times. Edgar: Well, I guess it's not as bad as Toshiaki's dare. * lightly slaps himself 15 times* Stop slapping myself… Toshiaki: You call that a slap? It looks more like you're patting yourself! Edgar: Well, PunkRockBuster never said how hard I was supposed to slap myself. Bob, I dare you to dress as a clown then let 4 people pelt you with cake, cream pie, pudding for not less than 3 minutes. Bob: Ooh! Yes please! *dresses like clown* Elsa: ohmygod. Uh, I'm just gonna…*leaves* Mina: Ok then. Who wants to throw stuff at Bob? Edgar, Toshiaki, Nassor, and Weird Girl: *volunteer* Bob: Wait! Question… Mina: No, you may not eat the food thrown at you. Bob: Aw, what? Edgar, Toshiaki, Nassor, and Weird Girl: *pelt Bob with cake, pie, and pudding for 3 minutes* Bob: All that food gone to waste! D: Food: *disappears* Bob: *is wearing normal clothes* Mina: Ok, Elsa, you can come back in now. Elsa: Phew! *shudders* Clowns… Truth: Victor, If you were forced to choose between bathing in ice-cold water or drink a large bottle of hot sauce, which will you choose? (If your answer is neither or non then I will dare you to do both.) Victor: The first one. I hate spicy food. Elsa, what is your favorite movie genre? Elsa: I like horror movies. Anything creepy and kinda strange. Weird Girl, how long can you hold your breath? Weird Girl: *sucks in breath* *Thirty seconds later* Weird Girl: Thirty seconds. Mina: That was a random question. Moving on to…Themaskedhunter. Oh victor that's just the beginning the werewolf thing was just to get you ready for what I have planed for you. now i dare you to grab a hot dog and run down the street shouting \"LOOK AT MY WEENER!\" As loud as you can :) Victor: Ugghhh, I hate doing dares in public! *grabs hot dog and runs outside* LOOK AT MY WIENER!

Watch all episodes of ... HAPPY TREE FRIENDS! Victor: What's Happy Tree Friends? Mina: It's a cartoon with a bunch of cute animals that tends to be a bit gory. Bob: And we have to watch all of the episodes? Mina: Yep. Don't worry, we have some time. Happy Tree Friends: *plays* *Hours Later* Mina: Well, that was certainly…interesting. Toshiaki: What did I just watch? Victor: I think my brain melted… Edgar: Hey, I thought it was ok. I am so evil :D Mina: Incredibly. :) Next we have…Guest. Nassor: give Toshiaki a wedgie (Better than having to kiss each other) Nassor: All right… *gives Toshiaki a wedgie* Toshiaki: Owww… Mina: Next, Dark Shadow. I dare Elsa to destroy Victor's X-Box (If he owns one, of course) using a baseball bat. And the worst part, do it in front of Victor, boy I bet he will be devastated Victor: Oh…actually, I don't have an X-Box. I never play video games, since I'm always busy with my homework, experiments, inventions, and, of course, taking care of Sparky. Sorry… Mina: It's ok, Victor. All right then, our next reviewer is TheMaskedHunter. Update update update I need more !

Truth: Toshi, how did it feel when Shelley tried to eat yu, or whatever it was doing? Toshiaki: Shelley a boy, not an \"it\". I felt terrified, of course.

Mina: Why not? *Dramatic moment* To see your beloved hamster, you must first find the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and the slipper as pure as gold. (It's not MY fault I'm obsessed with Into the Woods!) Nassor: All right. Then after that you can just sing Suddenly, Seymour with me Nassor: Wait, what? But I don't want to sing! (Please...it's a great song...the lyrics are so easy to find...). The items you need are in the forest from Into the Woods. I shall give you a map to Broadway Musical Land! *Gives map* Just ask nicely for them... but don't get crushed by a certain murderous giant! *Grins evilly* If he gets crushed, Zinka, that's YOUR fault for threatening me! Mina: Huh? Oh, never mind. Go find Colossus, Nassor! Nassor: Yay! *leaves* Toshiaki: He going to die, isn't he? Mina: We'll see. *Meanwhile…* Nassor: So…a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold. Oh, there's the cow! Hey you! Jack: Huh? Nassor: Uh…may I please have your cow? It's for a good cause! I need her so I can see my dead hamster again! Jack: Oh, all right… *gives Nassor the cow and tears up* Good-bye, Milky-White! *sings* I guess this is goodbye, old pal, You've been a perfect friend. I hate— Nassor: Are you seriously singing to a cow? Jack: Hey, don't judge me! Nassor: Sorry… *goes on his way* Next, a cape as red as blood. Oh, there it is. Milky-White: Moo. Red Riding Hood: Hey. Nassor: Um, can I have your cape, please? I need it so I can see my dead hamster again. Red Riding Hood: Your dead hamster? Nassor: Yeah. He got squished by a giant turtle, so I need the four ingredients so I can see him—or at least, his spirit. Red Riding Hood: Meh, all right. *gives cape* Nassor: Thank you! *leaves* Well, there's a giant tower. Maybe I'll find something in there. *tries to find door* Darn, it's locked. Well, I guess I could just…HEY YOU! UP THERE IN THE TOWER! Rapunzel: WHAT? Nassor: WHAT COLOR IS YOUR HAIR? Rapunzel: YELLOW. WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT? Nassor: UM, I NEED A PIECE OF IT SO I CAN SEE THE SPIRIT OF MY DEAD HAMSTER. PLEASE. Rapunzel: YEAH, SURE, WHATEVER. *cuts off a bunch of strands and wraps them together* HERE YOU GO! *throws it down* Nassor: THANKS! *leaves* Yes! Now I just need to find a slipper as pure as gold. Cinderella: Hi. Nassor: Hi. Is your shoe as pure as gold? Cinderella: Yep. *gives shoe* Nassor: Oh, thanks. How'd you know I needed it? Cinderella: *stares at cow, cape, and hair* That's how. Nassor: Oh. Ok, bye! Cinderella: Yeah… *leaves* Nassor: Finally! Colossus, here I come! Magical Stuff: *happens* Spirit-Colossus: *appears* *speech translated to English* Congratulations, Nassor. You have found all four ingredients and have completed the quest. Nassor: Colossus? Whoa, your human voice is so deep. Spirit-Colossus: Yeah. Manly, huh? Nassor: Yes…anyway. It's so good to see you again, Colossus! You have no idea how much I've missed you! Spirit-Colossus: Actually I do—I've felt the same way. It's so lonely without you. Nassor: Awww, Colossus. *tries to hug him* Oh. Forgot you're a ghost for a second. *sighs* I wish you could be in your normal form. Spirit-Colossus: *also sighs* Yeah. Unfortunately, since Shelley crushed me, I don't think I can come back to life again—at least, not in one piece. Anyway, so, how're things? Nassor: Good. How are you and Shelley? Spirit-Colossus: We're ok. I mean, we're not friends or anything, but I forgave him for killing me. The past is the past, you know? Nassor: We have a lot less in common than I realized. Spirit-Colossus: What can I say? I'm a hamster. I don't hold grudges. *starts to fade* Oops, time's up, I guess. Sorry, I should go… Nassor: Wait! Not yet! We only spent, like, thirty seconds together! Spirit-Colossus: I know. I'll try to visit you again, if I can! Bye, Nassor! Nassor: I guess I should probably get back, too…I need to sing a song for one of the fanfic reviewers. Bye! Spirit-Colossus: *disappears* Nassor: *is transported back* Toshiaki: You're alive! Mina: Yay, you saw Colossus! How was it? Nassor: It was great! We didn't get to talk for very long, though… Mina: Sorry you didn't get enough time! You should probably start singing now, though.

It will make me soooo happy if you do this! *Begs like puppy* Mina: Dude, it will make ME happy if you guys do this. *gives Victor and Elsa script* DO IT.

Victor is holding Elsa—who is badly wounded because of the bullet she took for him in order to save his life due to her unrequited, yet undying, love for him—close.- Toshiaki: Yoshi Yoshi Yoshi Yoshi Yoshi?

Oh, and \" neko \" means \"cat\", by the way. I really like cats, hehe. Weird Girl: *high-fives Mina* Edgar: So like, explain to me why you need attention so much. When I got my baby brother, he got all the attention, and I was fine with it. I never did bratty things. (Except for that one nail polish remover thing... but that's a different story) Edgar: Well, it's just that…I don't feel loved, sometimes. My parents and I aren't really close, and I've never had any real friends (until now, of course). I've never experienced real love… Weird Girl: Aww, Edgar… *hugs him* Edgar: …except from Harriet. :D Harriet: You and I should totally hang out together! We're so much alike! Weird Girl: We are? Could you, like, just...I don't know how to say this without offending you... but will you do the Bloody Mary thing? *Winces* I dared my friend to do that and she punched my gut.. I guess I deserved it. Weird Girl: Um, ok. *walks into wall* Ow…um, where's the bathroom? Mina: Oops, forgot you're supposed to be closing your eyes… Weird Girl: Yeah. *is transported into bathroom* *1 Minute Later* Mina: Did it work? Weird Girl: *shrugs* I didn't see her. Well, then again, my eyes were closed. Sorry if any of my \"I's\" aren't capitalized. My keyboard is all wonky today.

Mina: Whatever you feel like. Victor: Uh, ok… *writes: Dear needtohugVictor's Locker, Hey, you probably don't know me, but your owner does, so…say hi to her for me!

Nassor: Oh, I meant 7 ½ . Mina: You seriously got confused between 7 and 11? Nassor: *frowns* They rhyme! Toshiaki: Yoshi. (Idiot.) Speaking of ages, how old are y'all? Victor: We're all almost 11.

(Bye!)[Chapter 6] Ok guys, so here's what I've been thinking. I do enjoy writing this fic, but, as you probably already know, it takes a REEEAAAALLY long time to write the chapters. So instead of just writing this by myself, I was thinking that I could ask some of you to co-host/co-write the truth or dare thing with me. That way, I'll be able to update faster and it won't be too much work for me. Soooo…if anyone is interested in co-writing Truth or Dare: Frankenweenie Style, just PM me, and I will respond to you as soon as possible (I will also explain more on what you're going to do.). I will probably only choose one or two people to help me. Oh yeah, and whoever is interested must be willing to put in a lot of time and effort. :) Thank you and see you in the next chapter of Truth or Dare: Frankenweenie Style! -Mina ","Summary":" Zinka17: Hey everyone!

What if Toulouse, Berlioz and Marie would meet their real father? I own nobody. Please review.\" The end of the film: Aristocats. Thomas O Melie said his sad goodbyes to Duchess, Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse. It was killing him inside to leave this wonderful family. Like a evening before he told Duchess that the kittens needed a father role in their life. He knew he could never stand up to that role. All he did was save them and showed them how to survive in a street cat territory. Madame hugged happy all of her kittens and her cat Duchess. \"I am so pleased you all are ok. No bump, scratch. Just hungry. I'll go and fetch something for you my dears.\" Madame said happy. But Toulouse noticed Thomas was not there any more. Duchess walked ahead into her home. \"Hey guys. Where is Thomas?\" Toulouse asked his brother and sister. \"Why would he leave us? We have to get him in the family and quick.\" Marie said in a bit of a panic. Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz ran outside quickly and found Thomas O Melie just about to go round the corner and forget them forever. \"Thomas, wait please.\" Berlioz called out to him. Thomas stopped and looked back at the 3 kittens who were now pulling him on his paws to come back. \"What is it?\" Thomas asked them confused. \"Please stay father.\" Marie asked him. Thomas froze stiff. Did the young Marie just call him… father? Yes she did. \"We want you to stay with us and our mother. Please. And don't deny that you love our mother Thomas.\" Berlioz said chuckling. \"We saw that night with you two together. You both are practically made for each other.\" Toulouse said happy. Thomas had to blush so madly with knowing that the kittens knew that he had flirted with their mother. Duchess just came out whiles pulling on Madam's dress to show her their rescuer. \"What do you want to show me guys?\" Madam asked the kittens and Duchess. Thomas froze stiff. He bet the old lady would chase him away with a broom and squeal with anger. But she looked at Thomas and smiled. \"Hello sir. Are you the brave cat who saved my precious cat and her kittens?\" Madame asked him. \"Meow. (Yes madam.)\" Thomas replied. \"What do you guys think? Should we keep him in our family?\" Madam asked the kittens and her cat. \"Meow (Yes please.)\" Duchess and her kittens replied happy. So Thomas O Melie was happily accepted into the family by Madame, Duchess, Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse. And they staid together forever. But Thomas couldn't deny the close feel he had always when he saw the kittens. He taught them valuable survivor treats of what every cat and street cat had to know. Madam went out and bought more cat toys to train them up, a scratching tree and a small hidden cave just in case Thomas and Duchess wanted to have some private time with each other. One evening Madam sat by the fire place, Duchess and Thomas sat together in the cat basket and the kittens were playing fetch with a ball of wool. Then Madam had a good look at Thomas and noticed a birth mark on his chest. A sign of a small claw. The same as on Berlioz and Toulouse. \"Duchess. Have you met Thomas before?\" Madam asked the two adult cat's. Thomas and Duchess froze stiff. They can't remember meeting before. Thomas shook his head and gave Madam a questioners' look. Madam picked up Berlioz, Toulouse and Marie and showed their birth mark of a claw. \"Because they have the same claw pattern. And Duchess hasn't,\" Madam pointed it out confused. \"Meow (I can assure you. We never slept with each other).\" Thomas said very confused. \"It doesn't mater. Now guys. Bed time.\" Madam called out to the 5 cat's. Madam picked up the kittens and Duchess pulled lightly at Thomas fur to come with them. They walked upstairs to a cat bedroom for them. There Duchess, Marie, Berlioz, Toulouse and Thomas washed themselves up and then fell fast asleep. Quanktumspirit:,, How is Thomas related to the kittens in my story? Not really of course. Find out soon. Please review. I own nobody.\"[Chapter 2] A walk in the park brings back important memories Quanktumspirit: \"Please review. I own nobody.\" The next morning the cat family had their breakfast, washed and then Madame let them outside for the day. \"Duchess. You can show Mr. O Melie around if you like. But come back by 1 P.M. Got that?\" Madame asked her two cat's. \"Meow. (Yes Madam.)\" Duchess said happy. The cat family headed out to the park and she showed Thomas all the places she and her kittens loved to go. Thomas showed her further into the park. While Berlioz, Toulouse and Marie played catch with each other in the park grass Duchess took Thomas further down the park to a beautiful spot, there they kept a close eye on the kittens. \"Is there a reason why we are here?\" Thomas asked Duchess. \"Yes… I want to tell you how I got the kids.\" Duchess said looking at her children. They looked back to the 3 playing kittens before Duchess told him the story. \"As I was 3 years old madam sent me to a sanctuary to be mated with a white pedigree tom-cat. I first thought it would be great. But he hurt me bad and I cried threw the night,\" Duchess began her tale. \"If he was white with you and you are pure white. Shouldn't Berlioz and Toulouse be white as well?\" Thomas asked confused as he pointed the black and ginger kitten out. \"Actually yes. My guess is what happened next. A cat called Bob who had all the colours Toulouse and Berlioz have asked me if I would like to spend the night with him. Me being a crazy teen at the time thought that it would be a good idea and left with him. We had a heck of a time and I loved the time with him more then with the pedigree tom-cat.\" Duchess continued to explain. \"Let me guess the next part. As you gave birth to the 3 kittens madam was shocked to find 2 mixed breads with a pure bread?\" Thomas guessed. \"She was indeed. The vet told her that Berlioz and Toulouse should be destroyed.\" Duchess said. Tears suddenly fell from her face saddened by that memory. Thomas was shocked. The vet must be mad of ever suggesting something like that. \"As I heard the news I was shocked. I would never allow anybody take apart my family. So I was about to leave madam forever, but as I was about to leave with Berlioz in my mouth she sprinted across the room, pulled me and Berlioz inside and told me that she loved us all equally. And a pedigree is not to be pure. But how you are raised. So we all stayed with Madam.\" Duchess finished her story. \"I see. And they all are getting along nicely.\" Thomas said pleased with the kittens. \"As nicely as cats get along.\" Duchess joked. They both had a kiss and walked back. Thomas looked back to the park and could guess who that Tom-cat was Duchess was talking about. He secretly left his sense to the closest tree to give the sign that he was back. Quanktumspirit: \"Does Thomas know the cat? Review to find out please.\"[Chapter 3] Meeting the father, uncle and brother Quanktumspirit: \"I'm so sorry that I forgot this story. But I will try and update it faster. Please carry on reviewing. I own nobody. Written date: Saturday 8th September. 2012.\" As it was evening Thomas got up after seeing Duchess was fast asleep and woke up Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse. He wanted to show them something. \"Yawn. What is it Thomas?\" Marie asked her 'adoptive father' \"I would like you 3 to meet your uncle.\" Thomas explained. The 3 kittens looked shocked at Thomas. He has a brother? Now there is something you don't expect every night. The 3 kittens were fully awake and followed Thomas outside. He climbed of the roof and into a small sidewalk close to the park. \"What are we doing here?\" Toulouse asked him confused. \"You will see.\" Thomas said grinning. Thomas sent out a cranky and long sounding meow. A short while later the same cranky meow was heard and a tom cat came out. He had black and red patches all over his body and golden eyes. Just like Thomas. \"Um… Thomas. Who is he?\" Berlioz asked him scared and confused. \"Thomas o Malay? Is that really you bro?\" The Stray cat asked surprised. \"Yes it is Bob o Malay. How have you been bro?\" Thomas addressed the stray cat. \"He is your brother?\" Toulouse asked their father confused. \"Sure am. We haven't seen each other since we have been born. So all systems still go?\" Bob O Malay asked him. \"Sure…um?\" Thomas said nodding his head. Bob looked behind Thomas and saw 3 kittens looking at him interested. He was amazed and bowed down to Thomas to show that he respects him and his kittens. \"Congratulations Thomas. How is your mistress?\" Bob asked him. Thomas blushed a bit and looked happy at the trio. \"Actually to be fair with you bro. There my step-children. Not by birth.\" Thomas told his brother honest. \"Oh sorry. Why have you searched my presents?\" Bob asked him confused. \"I am guessing… that you Bob are their birth father of Berlioz and Toulouse.\" Thomas explained. Now all the cats looked shocked at Bob. He was there real father? Him? Bob wasn't sure eider. \"How can you tell? I have been with many female cats before. How can you be sure that they are my kittens?\" Bob asked him. \"Easy as pie. (Picks up carefully Berlioz and Toulouse and rolls them on the stomach.) They have the same birth sign as we. And I haven't mated with Duchess. And we are the only brothers of our family litter so it had to be you. As well you know our birth mother was cut after our birth so we couldn't have any more brothers or sisters from her any way,\" Thomas explained. \"Point taken bro. You still have all the withes of Sherlock Holms. Nobody should underestimate your cleverness.\" Bob said chuckling. \"Hahaha. I have the brains while you have the looks?\" Thomas asked him jokingly. \"Exactly.\" Bob said as he stretched himself out. \"So he is sort of our father?\" Marie asked the two grown up cats. \"Looks like it kitty. And Thomas look after them well. Promise?\" Bob asked his brother worried. \"You know me bro. I never let my guard down.\" Thomas said seriously. Bob nodded and wanted to leave them alone. But suddenly Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse ran up to him and hugged him. They felt a mind at piece being with there real father and knowing he is ok. He smiles down at them and pushed them carefully back to Thomas. \"If you want you could take as well your lady out for a walk and I can show the kittens all the best places?\" Bob offered. \"Good idea. But it will have to wait till tomorrow. The 3 kittens need their rest.\" Thomas said as he looked back at the kittens. Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse started to yawn and they said there goodbyes to Bob and walked as fast as they could back to bed . Quanktumspirit: \"Aw. How cute. Berlioz, Toulouse and Marie have meet up with there real father. Please review. I own nobody.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 04 The Mother knows Quanktumspirit: \"Same problems, college work, third computer exploded and now no inspiration what so ever, so this story will end now.\" Just as Thomas, Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse got back home they quietly curled round each other and slept downstairs in front of the extinct fire place, but it still held a warm glow in the room that Thomas thought was relaxing. The words of his brother kept burning in the back of his mind: Bob o'Malay: 'Thomas look after them well.' Thomas nodded in his dream. Just as he was about to close his eyes whiles looking at the kittens, he heard the old stairs from Madame Bonfamille creak quietly. Quickly he woke up and scanned the empty room. Thomas quietly turned his head around and scanned the empty room, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary, the three kittens were next to him fast asleep. Breathing softly against his fur sending small shivers threw his bones, but he was sure somebody or something was up. He walked up to the living room door and carefully opened it. He walked up to the stares and sniffed the air, a faint perfume smell left his nose and it told him that Madame Bonfamille has been up these stairs about 4 hours ago. Carrying with her Duchess. Most likely. But why was Duchess smell now so much stronger, as if she has come up and down the stairs quiet a few times? Quietly he walked the stairs up and at the top sitting at the barrier between a 8 meter drop into the first floor was Duchess curled on a cushion peaking threw the bannisters. She didn't look happy. Thomas o Malay wanted to whack himself, of course she would be mad that he took the kittens out of their well known environment and out into the streets, especially at night. How could he make it up to her? Sadly except telling her the truth nothing came to his mind. He quietly and carefully walked up to Duchess and looked at the Pedigree white queen cat. She pretended to be asleep, but her irregular breathing movements threw her nose told Thomas that she was not in a deep sleep what so ever. He decided to try and hold a conversation with her. \"How was your evening Duchess?\" Thomas asked her first. Duchess stretched a little and got up, after rubbing her paws against her face to wash the sleep out the white Pedigree cat looked at Thomas and glared a little bit. \"Well Thomas, it was quite nice, had a lovely dinner, but you and the kittens were gone almost the entire evening. I know that cats are mostly active during the night, but I thought I managed to train Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz to be day active cats like me,\" Duchess said a bit upset. Thomas bowed his head to his queen and rubbed his chin in an affectionate manner to his lady, he bowed once more before he said, \"I'm sorry for not telling you, how come you haven't told the children who their father is, especially Toulouse and Berlioz?\" Duchess sighed, \"I don't want the children to feel as if they belonged in two different families, when they came from two different fathers. Wait does it mean they know who their fathers are?\" \"Yes, I noticed it as Toulouse and Berlioz were acting very much like myself as I was a kitten in my younger day's. So I worked it out it might be in my family tree,\" Thomas explained. \"What? You mean you are related to Cyrano de Bergerac? But how he is or was for I don't know what happened to him, a white Pedigree Tom cat,\" Duchess asked surprised and shocked. But Thomas shook his head, \"No not to Cyrano... what not. Nop I mean the other Tom cat you mated with. And don't deny it Duchess, he told me the entire truth, and I worked it out myself.\" Duchess was taken by surprise, she tried to remember who Thomas meant. But no... wait a minuet, she remembers escaping the pen with a mixed breed cat, he was called... Bob... if her memories weren't betraying her. \"You mean Bob the stray cat is your brother?\" Duchess asked surprised. Thomas nodded his head, \"He is Duchess, I thought you didn't know much about my family, and yet you mated with my own brother, I feel honoured for that. Plus if my own memories aren't betraying me. Me and Bob were the only males from a litter of 5 kittens. We had 3 sisters who had it a lot easier then me or Bob, but our last owner could give all the girls away instantly, our own father was a black cat whiles our mother was a red cross bread cat. Just after our birth and I could see I noticed she had a black lined cut across her stomach. After I moved out and lived my life on a street I found on a garbage heap a book about pregnancy and the 'mother sack and cake' which are in every female must have been removed form her, because my mother never again had a litter of kittens in her life. So it must have been from him seeing as I haven't mated with you at all.\" Duchess looked slightly stunned, he just gave her part of his own family history. And it sounded like he could read her past just as easy. She hung her head down sad, expecting Thomas to hiss and snap at her. But he didn't she blinked and looked back up at him. Thomas just cleaned his face a bit and waited patiently for Duchess to tell him the entire truth. \"You are correct Thomas, though I didn't know myself that you were related to Bob at all. So I just tried to hid it from my children so they still could feel like an entire family, and not like 2 children from one male cat and one child from the other one. That's why I never told them, how did Berlioz, Toulouse and Marie react to the father news?\" Duchess asked. \"Quite well actually,\" Thomas said, \"They were first a bit confused, even Bob o' Malley didn't believe me that he was the biological father, but as I showed him the children's birth marks he believed me then. After that he asked me if we all could visit him later on and he wanted to interact more with his children.\" Duchess hung her head down a bit sad. True the children should have a chance at seeing both parents more often, but would Bob accept them back in his life? He is a street cat, she is a house cat. It would be a hard try, but worth the attempt. Instead of answering both adult cats curled up around each other and fell fast asleep. Then the morning came a few hours later. The kittens woke up a while later and walked up to the two adult cats Marie walked up to her mother and rubbed her head against her mother lovingly to wake her up. Berlioz and Toulouse looked at their mother, begging her with their sweet 'kitty eyes' to let them interact more with their 'father'. Duchess first grabbed her 3 kittens, she gave them a good wash before facing Thomas again. He has given himself a good wash before his mate would do the embarrassing deeds before him. After the cat family had their wash Duchess nodded her head. \"Ok, come let's visit Bob then... I'm still impressed Thomas that you managed to work out who the father is,\" Duchess said smiling at her lover. Thomas chuckled as well. As Madame Adelaide Bonfamille took them out on another horse and coach ride in the afternoon they came across the park. Frou-Frou trotted threw the park and then stopped at a huge grassed area. The coach man let the cats out, helped Madame Adelaide out of the coach and un-attached Frou-Frou from the coach so she could eat on the grassed area. He set up a picnic and the two adults chatted amongst each other. Frou-Frou ate some of the grass around her and smiled at the cat family. Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse played catch, chase and tag with each other. Duchess laid in the grass and watched her beloved kittens, but as she was about to turn round wondering what Thomas was up to, she noticed he suddenly disappeared. Quickly she got up, stretched and looked around the park for her lover. Ah she noticed he was over by a water fountain not to far from her. Duchess purred to herself smiling over to him, \"He must be having a wash, or a drink over there. Nothing to worry about.\" But suddenly she noticed Thomas walking all the way around the fountain, and he was at the other end of it in a near minuet, out of her view. Duchess stretched once more as she walked up to Adelaide. The old woman was just eating a sandwich as Duchess stroked over her hand. \"What is it darling?\" Adelaide asked her. \"Trromass,\" Duchess tried to reply back. Adelaide looked around and knew what Duchess was trying to tell her. 'The cat man of the house' has disappeared. But Adelaide didn't seem to worried, \"Don't worry darling, Thomas is a wild street cat, they need to stretch their paws out once in a while. He will be back in a bit.\" Duchess nodded her head, it was true, but that he wouldn't tell them where he ran of to was still a mystery to her. Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse continued to play catch with each other. On one large leave in the park Toulouse slipped out and went rolling down the small hill. \"Mrriaw!\" Toulouse screamed in shock. The other two playing kittens didn't notice the kitten suddenly disappear as they found a cockroach and were throwing it back and forth between each other. Toulouse tried to jump of the leave, as it suddenly came to an abrupt stop. A large brown, orange and black cat jumped in front of the kitten and caught it in his chest. Toulouse blinked as the cat pulled back from him and looked at the kitten. Then the cat who Toulouse recognised as his 'dad' Bob suddenly started communicating with him. \"You ok Toulouse? Better get back to your brother and sister,\" Bob said nodding to the other two kittens. Toulouse scampered back up to his feet, he just stared at Bob. Happy that he saved him from going to, god knows where the hill ended. He nodded and ran back to his brother and sister. But just before he left he looked at Bob a second time. \"Come play with us to dad,\" Toulouse said. Bob was taken back by that request over a kitten he barely knows for a full day. But he shook his head. \"No Toulouse, I let you and your brother and sister have the fun. I have to be on my way anyway to meet up with somebody,\" Bob said. Before he let Toulouse ask him something Bob was gone again. Toulouse blinked a bit and walked back to his brother, sister and his mother. Once he was back he continued to play, eventually the cat family fell asleep at the warm sunshine. Thomas looked towards his sleeping family, as he was sure Duchess was asleep as well he quietly walked of towards his brother to have a chat. With Bob and his brother Thomas As the two street cats were sure that all 4 were fast asleep they walked away from them and climbed up a tree overlooking the small picnic. \"So Thomas, everything still ok with your new family?\" Bob asked as he licked his paws clean. Thomas nodded as he looked happy at his family, \"Sure, I'm as happy as I could ever be. Thank you brother for being honest with me.\" \"No problem brother. I hope to some day get more nieces and nephews from you two soon,\" Bob said and chuckled. Thomas entire face heated itself up with embarrassment. Sure it would be great to extend their 'family tree' with Duchess, but only time will tell if the family will be expanded and how. After a stretch they jumped down and their failure at landing jerked Duchess awake. Duchess woke up shocked, Bob shrieked in shock and shot out of the area. Duchess blinked as she watched the brown and ginger cat run for his life. Thomas stood as stiff as a board knowing that Duchess new that he knew of her 'affair' with Bob. She stretched one more time, but instead of hissing at Thomas she looked at him confused. \"Thomas... wasn't that Bob? What... how did he find us?\" Duchess asked shocked. Thomas rolled his eyes in his head, \"Well Duchess dear, this is a public park, and unless cats are not tied to a family like we, so with a owner, then they can run about how they please. And the park is full of mice, rats, birds and other meals for any wild cat to feast upon.\" Duchess nodded her head and looked towards the distance where her 'ex-lover' disappeared. The kittens walked to their mother and looked at her. \"Mother... that cat, was Bob... wasn't it?\" Marie asked her mother. Duchess knew she couldn't lie to her children any more, she bowed her head to her children and softly cried before herself. Duchess looked back up to her 3 children, and softly nodded her head, \"Yes... Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse. That is Bob... and according to Thomas, his full name is Bob O'Malay, so his brother and your uncle. I... I hope you 3 can forgive me for not telling you sooner of who your real father is.\" The 3 kittens smiled at their mother and rubbed their heads against her, as a sign that she is forgiven. \"Its ok mum, dad... dad will always be in our lives, as a half and a half they both make a full,\" Berlioz said chuckling. The 3 kittens nodded their heads and hugged Thomas pleased, he smiled back at them. As it was getting late they headed back, Bob sat on a top of a hill and watched his brother and their new family leave once more for home. He stretched and smiled pleased, finally after years of searching, he and his brother have found their right full homes. Thomas as a happy, well fed, happily in love house cat, and Bob as a wild, fighting and passionate street lover of the night. Bob knew that their families will always be together, no matter how much they both grow up, he was also sure that one day, he will find his actual lover and mate. After Bob left he returned to his home on a small farm, there he meet up with a elder male, he licked his head and rubbed himself to that male cat. \"Bob o Malay, welcome back. Did you find him?\" The older cat asked. Bob smiled and kissed him, \"Yes my dear father... Elderas o Malay. I found my brother Thomas o Malay finally after 6 years (human years). He is doing very well... and um... you remember the beautiful she cat I mated with a few years back?\" Elderas nodded his head slowly. \"Well... she has given birth to 2 of my kittens, from another cat she has a 3rd one... and Thomas is their adoptive father. They all are wonderful, and I know that inside their hearts they all see themselves now as a happy family,\" Bob reported to his dad. Elderas smiled at his son and nodded his head, \"Perfect, no mater who a baby comes from, as long as the parent or parents love them from their purest of hearts, then they will never be appart from each other.\" Bob smiled and nodded his head, he was so happy that the kittens had a huge family, that his very own brother was the mate of the beautiful Duchess and he the birth father of the babies, but they all will never depart from each other, no mater what faith throws at them.

My own life is important enough to chart. I think I'm destined for greatness. After all, my name is Destiny. I mean, I'm a freshman at University of Nevada and there's a fifty-fifty chance that I'll get to be a dancer at the Bellagio. I mean, I'm a blonde after all. And okay, I might be slightly too short at five foot one, but I've got the body for it. The only thing left is for me to meet a man with real aspirations. After all, I'm going places. I might be a headliner after college. Maybe I could start dating a Backstreet Boy, but I'm not famous enough yet. And I've been to all the frat parties both semesters, and it's like no one is worthy of me. I want to meet the kind of guy who can do something for me. Like buy me expensive jewelry and pay for my stuff and get me out of school. My mother said that the only reason a girl like me should go to college is for her MRS. But all the rich guys are, like, at the big fancy schools like UCLA that I couldn't get into. It's so not fair. I mean, I'm like gorgeous. Where have all the good guys gone? I mean, there's some pretty rich guys at the casinos, but they, like, have wives. I am nobody's mistress. Well, not since the last time, when the guy's wife nearly broke my nose. But it was only once or twice. Like, I don't know. Life is so annoying. I mean, my gal pal Candi has a rich boyfriend and she's a heifer. Like, a size 8. Ugh. When will I meet my special someone? January 9, 1997 12:33 pm Dear Diary, I didn't get the job. I can't believe it! It's like my whole life is over. All I have are my stupid classes now. I overheard the casting guys talking, and I know what the problem is. My breasts. I knew B cups weren't big enough! God, I need a boob job, but I don't have the money. And now, I can't get the money unless I take that hostess job at PJ Gilligan's. But I can't. I still have shame. I think. I miss high school. In high school, I was the shit. Now, my life is shit. I was the most beautiful girl in Minnesota, the winner of the All-American Teen Pageant in '94, '95, and '96. But here, that doesn't matter. I'm in a jungle of Amazonian beauties and extra enhanced girls. It's like being a Seventeen cover girl in a world of full-blown supermodels. The only guys who notice are college chumps with no money. I never should have left Weiland. I really thought I could be a showgirl, like in \"Copacabana\". But I was so wrong. I'm nothing in Vegas. Nothing but a blonde, flat chested smurf. January 11, 1997 12:55 am Dear Diary, Why is it impossible to stand school? I thought I could at least meet a husband in college, but since that has been a bust, it's like I have no reason to be here. I only have one male professor, and he's not even cute! I guess I should drop out and move back home. There isn't anything for me here. I could start up on the pageant circuit again. I went out tonight, and no one important even noticed me. I mean, sure, I hooked up with this one guy who was kind of cute, and I even gave him a blowjob, but he was, like, maybe three inches taller than me, and I don't think he was rich. I haven't seen him at UNevada, but who knows? Maybe he's in one of my classes. Not that I'm into him. I mean, like I said, he's fairly cute. Like a little leprechaun. And then I hooked up with Candi's boyfriend, but since he won't break up with her, I'm still high and dry. It sucks raw ass.[Chapter 2] 1/13/97 11:26 am Dear Diary, I got a job! And okay, it's pretty shitty, but at least it's not PJ Gilligan's. There was a new professor in one of my classes today. His name was Dr. Evil. I wonder if that's Chinese. He has like, an office underground that I'm supposed sort out mail and make coffee at. Like an office assistant. So that could be cool. I could end up pouring coffee for a super rich guy or something. But not Dr. Evil. He's pretty ugly, and a girl has to have standards. I think he might be rich, though...nope, can't go through with it. I'm a golddigger, not a whore. My first day is tomorrow. I wasn't told to dress professionally or anything, so at least I won't have to buy new clothes. Although now I feel like shopping. I might as well go out anyway. Tomorrow, I'll definitely meet a great, phenomenally rich and hunky guy at work. I should look my hottest. 1/14/97 12:03 am Dear Diary, I think I screwed up majorly, once again. So I went to the mall after my last class this afternoon. Everything was fine at first. I hit up Contempo, Express, and Wet Seal for new outfits, and then I went shopping for accessories at Afterthoughts. All sounds good so far, right? So, finally, I decide to hit up Structure for some men's jeans, so I bag and cinch them at the same time. So, you know, I wouldn't have to buy the real expensive denim cargos at The Gap, or pick up a pair of JNCOs that would show my panties in the least sexy way possible. So I go into Structure, and it turns out the guy from last night is there too. Scotch or whatever his name is. Then again, maybe that was just what I was drinking in the club. I can't feel bad about it, cause he didn't remember my name either. We've spent the day calling each other \"you.\" Yeah, that's right. The day. As in, here I am in his room right now. It smells like gym socks and Old Spice in here. But it's not like I can just leave. I mean, now I feel like I have to stay. He bought me dinner at Panda Express (where we ate and stared at each other awkwardly). And then he took me to his apartment in the Valley (blindfolded until we got to his room - kinky, right?) and actually gave me a backrub. I mean, I can't just leave a guy who did all that, even if it's possible he invited me there because he still had my panties from Friday night and he wanted to give them back. But that's absolutely it. I will not hook up with this guy ever again. No matter how bad it feels to end it. I mean, it will definitely be weird. I mean, even though he doesn't remember my name, I think he has real feelings for me. I mean, before I started writing, he was spooning me. So that's it. I'm rolling back into his arms and going asleep. Then I'll wake up in six or seven hours and sneak out before he notices. That's all there is to it. 1/14/97 6:08 pm Dear Diary, Well, I found out why Scott (club guy who is apparently my BOYFRIEND now) blindfolded me the whole way to his apartment's bedroom. Because it's no apartment. It's his dad's place! Yeah, that's right! He lives with his parents. That's almost as bad as being one of those A Capella losers, for God's sake! But wait, this gets even better! Guess who his dad is? That's right, my current boss, Dr. Evil. That's right. I fucked the boss's son on my first day. That's gotta be a strike against my record! And it totally ruined my chances of having an in and getting promoted. This one lesbian lady, Frau Fraustein or whatever, was totally checking me out, until she heard Scott and I hooked up. One French kiss and I wouldn't be coffee girl anymore. But nooooo. How did this disaster of epic proportions occur, you might ask. Well, I really overslept last night. I woke up at noon. Noon! I missed all my classes except for the one special spelling class at four and Remedial Math at seven, but it's not like I was planning on going to those anyway. So I get out of Scott's bed and walk out of his room (which, by the way, was really gross and messy and I slipped on an open Playboy spread of Jenny McCarthy, and would have broken my neck if it hadn't been for a pile of dirty clothes), and go into the hallway. And that's when I realize where I am. Dr. Evil literally gave me a tour yesterday morning when I got recruited. I remember because he grabbed my ass \"by accident\" and I decided to ignore it so I could still get a job somewhere beside PJ Gilligan's. So I run back into Scott's room, and throw on my clothes from yesterday (because I couldn't go get coffee in just a raggedy bathrobe and my Vicky's Secrets; I might burn myself). Then I finally started leaving, when Dr. Evil came down the hallway. \"Destiny,\" he snapped. \"You're very late. Like, by four hours. And why are you wearing the same thing you wore yesterday? You didn't think I'd remember? That's just gross! And no one has been here to get any kind of coffee, cause God knows, no one else can work the machine, and...\" He trailed off as he looked at something behind me. I turned around and saw Scott walking out his room in that raggedy robe, which he had left hanging wide open, and just his shorts. \"What time is it,\" he grumbled to himself. \"Scotty,\" Dr. Evil snapped. \"It would be nice if you could not greet everyone with the sight of your balls this afternoon.\" He looked down and Evil snickered. \"Made ya look. But really, put some clothes on. No one wants to see that.\" Scott smirked. \"I don't know. She seemed to like the view last night,\" he said, gesturing at me. My stomach dropped to my feet. Not only did I sleep with the guy who broke into the lair , I thought. But now my professor knows. What if I get kicked out of school for this? And then I'll really have to work at PJ Gilligan's. Evil raised his eyebrows and stared at me in shock. \"You saw fit to have an adult slumber party last night with my son?\" I nearly dry heaved. \"What?\" \"You work for him?\" Scott gasped. \"Oh, boy, did I cause a rift in this relationship,\" Evil asked, snickering. \"Damn it,\" I moaned. \"Oh, don't worry, Destiny. It is fine with me if my boy has a little girlfriend.\" \"Wait,\" I started. \"I am not-\" \"Of course she's my girlfriend, Dad,\" Scott yelled over me. He wrapped an arm around my shoulder and grinned. \"Isn't she great?\" Evil looked me up and down. \"She looks cheap,\" he commented. I gritted my teeth. I thought I was in so much trouble. \"Very well,\" Evil finally said. \"Get to work, Destiny.\" And that was it. I got the mail and made coffee, including a cup for Scott (I spit in it), and then at 5:30, I was dismissed for lunch later. I went back to Scott's room to grab some of my stuff, hitched a ride back to campus from the lair's remote location, and went back to my dorm room. Instead of grabbing a bite to eat, I showered and changed into a huge blue Oriental floral print blouse left half-buttoned, a matching micro mini with black shorts underneath, and gold lace up heels. I think that outfit will help me gain back some of my dignity. I have to get back to work soon, so I might as well get moving. I should probably grab a bag of chips or something for the road. 1/14/97 8:36 PM Dear Diary, I'm taking this bit of free time that I have to give a full report on the rest of my day so far. I got back to hear Number 2 and Evil discussing whether or not Destiny was a stripper name (Evil was leaning towards hooker) behind my back. That was fun. Then when I went brought back some Snapple, someone (Frau Farberini, I think) grabbed my ass. Everyone had a great laugh about that. Then I went into the printing station to make copies of some memo, and guess who was there waiting me? Scott, of course. He asked if I could pretend to be his girlfriend until Evil would want him to propose in a few years. He suggested I cheat on him at that point. I told him no. Then he asked if I would really go out with him. I said maybe. I probably would, especially since I know he's rich now, but I didn't want to sound desperate. And also, I wasn't sure if he was in love with me or not. If he only wanted to go out with me because I put out yesterday, it wouldn't be real. I'd hope he liked me for a real reason, like how pretty I am. So then I made the copies, got my ass grabbed again, and now I'm sitting in my designated seat, far, far away from the conference table, and writing here. I bet they don't want me to spill their toy making secrets. After all, Dr. Evil has an underground lair in the valley because his whole team is designing really exclusive, top secret Beanie Babies. At least, that's what he told me on the tour yesterday. I hope this means I get one of the special Beanies for free. Not so I can sell it or anything. Just because those toys are sooooo cute. Anyway, apparently, I have to have dinner here, but no way am I eating. One of the main rules of getting a guy is not to eat in front of him unless he pays for it, and Scott isn't the one paying. So therefore, I am just going to wait until everyone else eats, and then hide in the bathroom and eat. Even though Evil ordered Domino's, which is my favorite kind of pizza. I can wait. I can wait until midnight if it takes that long for me to be able to sneak away. 1/14/97 9:23 PM Dear Diary, Well, that plan didn't pan out well. It started out fine. The pizza came, everybody was grabbing a slice or two, and I stayed in my chair and tuned the mini TV in the corner to watch Beavis and Butthead. But then Scott came over. At first it was cool, since we both like B&B; and we even laughed at the same jokes. But then he had bring up food. Idiot. \"I'm not that hungry,\" I lied. At first, he shrugged and turned back to the TV. But then my stomach made this low, awkward rumbling noise. And it wasn't even something I could just brush off. It was loud enough to make a few other people turn around. So of course, Scott starts smirking at me. I mean, why couldn't he have ignored it? \"You wanna a slice,\" he asked. I blushed and nodded. Mere moments later, I was contemplating if there was possibly any way I could still look sexy while eating a slice of oily pepperoni pizza. I considered dabbing down the slice with a napkin - nah, the paper just glues to. cheese. Maybe I could have lifted it into my mouth gently, and then bit off the tip. I tried staring at it from another angle. Nope. I could think of no possible way to feminize eating a slice of cheesy, greasy pizza. So I gave up and ate it. Thankfully, there was no garlic or anything other than the pepperoni mixed in, so at least I won't feel fat and get bad breath out of the whole deal. So I hit rock bottom: I went for two more slices. Somebody else grabbed my ass on the way over there, but I could care less. I was just too humiliated. I can't believe Scott knows how much I can eat now! It's so embarrassing. Then again, it was a Catch-22. Look like a fat pig or a high maintenance anorexic. There was no way I could have won. It is so hard to try to get an MRS. I should get more credit than those snooty feminists give me.

The UN wants you to find thesencanisters and neutralize the contents.\" \"How am I supposed tonneutralize something if I don't know what it is?\" \"That's why you'llnbe paired with top Splinter Cell…\" Third Echelon,nNSA HQ/ Air Force One \"… Sam!\" barkednLambert over the wireless communicator to the forty-eight year oldnsecret agent, Sam Fisher who has trying, and failing, to catch somenextra sleep on the 747 Air Force One. \"Chill out Lambert,\"nsaid Fisher from the jet's cargo hold, \"What's wrong with anlittle shut-eye?\" \"Need I remind younthat you're on a mission?\" \"Not really. But youncan if you want to.\" \" (sigh) Alright:nfirst you had to neutralize the Iraqi ambassador…\" \"Check.\" \"…then hack hisnlaptop…\" \"Check.\" \"Then disarm anneutron bomb hidden in the 747's cargo hold.\" \"Which has ten hoursnleft on the timer. A little sleep isn't going to jeopardize thennation.\" Lambert, 2,000 milesnaway in the HQ's lowest levels, rubbed his eyes in exasperation. AsnSam got older, it seemed he got more and more irritating. Suddenlynthe hot line to England rang. \"Hello?\" saidnLambert \"Is this ThirdnEchelon?\" asked the voice on the other end. \"So what if it is?\" \"MI6 wants to know.\" \"MI6? What do younwant?\" \"We need Sam Fisher'snhelp in a matter of global security.\" \"He's, uh, a littlenbusy.\" \"Not any morenLambert,\" said Sam. \"Fisher! How longnwere you listening?\" asked Lambert, a little miffed that Sam wasneavesdropping, but then again, that was his job. \"This bird lands innEngland in three hours,\" informed Sam, \"I'll meet out 'friends'nsoon.\" Lambert hung up thenphone. One thought ran through his mind: What in Grim's name isngoing on?[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Air Force One landed innEngland without incident. Reporters flocked to the scene when anstewardess found the Iraqi ambassador unconscious, having beennrendered so by a sticky shocker. Sam Fisher, being the ace spy thatnhe was, slipped away from the jet through the landing gear well. \"Okay Lambert,\"nsaid Fisher through his headset, \"where do I meet our MI6 contact?\" \"He's waiting innthe parking lot,\" responded Lambert ,\"You might want to removenthe spy gear though.\" \"Really…\" quippednthe spy sarcastically. Sam glanced down at his gear: Five-Sevennsuppressed pistol, laser mic, combat knife, flash and chaff grenades,nand a grenade launcher. He was going to have tonstash this stuff if he was going to be incognito. An idle luggagentrolley sat only ten meters, providing the stashing place for hisnplethora of weapons. Sam ran toward the vehicle and dived behind it.nGrabbing the first suitcase he came to, an old battered brown casenwith \"Viva Mexico\" stickers stuck to it. Ignoring the tackynlabels, Fisher popped open the case, liberating several articles ofnclothing, which he neatly tucked on to the buggy. Fisher then removednhis gear and crammed as many gadgets as he could into the case. Getting through thenairport was no problem, although Fisher drew the occasional sidewaysnglance from people wondering what a guy in a black jumpsuit was doingnin the middle of the England international airport. Sam could feelnthe once-overs people were giving him. The people, however, werenunconcerned, seeing no weapons and therefore no cause for alarm.nAlthough Sam did have to elbow whack a nosy tourist who kept pokingnhis flak jacket. A plain black limo satnin the parking lot. Sam walked casually over to it and rapped on onenof the windows. \"Who is it?\" said anvoice on the other side. \"Airport security,nwould you please step out of the car?\" said Sam. There were fewnthings he liked better than messing with people. To the Splinter Cell'snsurprise, the door popped open, giving him a good whack in thenkneecaps, causing him to groan in pain. Two British men sat in thenlimo: one was dressed like a 60's swinger, the other in morenbusiness like attire. \"Let me guess, you'renmy MI6 contact?\" asked Sam. \"Hop in Mr. Fisher,nwe have much to tell you,\" said the business brit. Fisher got into thenlimo and it pulled out of the airport and onto the highway. The sleeknblack stretch sedan was equipped with a mini-bar, shag carpet and ancondom dispenser. \"So why am I here?\"nasked Sam. \"You're here tonhelp us save the earth from total destruction,\" said the businessnman,\" but first, introductions are in order: I am Basil Expositionnand this is Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery.\" \"Man of Mystery? Justnmy luck, I get stuck with a James Bond wannabe,\" gripped Sam. \"Hey! I am not!\"nAustin said indignantly, \"I've saved the world three times, andnmade three feature films about said adventures.\" \"Well I've savednthe world from international terrorists four times. Andnstarred in four video games, three novels and soon a movie of my own,nabout those exploits.\" \"Alright that'snenough!\" commanded Basil, \"It's time for your briefings: Atn1100 hours, a group of heavily armed cyborg ninjas, lead by FatnBastard, attacked a biological weapons laboratory and made off with ancontagion labeled ND133.\" \"ND133? Am I the onlynone who's having Déjà vu moment?\" Sam askednrhetorically. He remembered the mission to destroy the deadly smallnpox virus back in Pandora Tomorrow. \"Yes, and we believenthat Dr. Evil is involved,\" said Basil, \"The first stop younshould make to find Evil's hideout is Club Doomsday in downtownnMunich.\" Meanwhile, in thenSeattle Space Needle Dr. Evil, second evilest man in the galaxy nextnto Darth Vader and way badder than the Bush Administration, ran isnbling laden fingers over the trapezoidal \"Pox Box\" that containednhis latest world domination scheme. \"Excellent work, FatnBastard,\" drawled Dr. Evil \"All right you gotnyer' pox,\" said Fat Bastard with a thick Scottish accent,\" nownwhere's ma' munny?\" \"Now we both know youndon't want cash, so I took the liberty of having Number Two collectnyour favorite food: Baby meat!\" \"Baby meat!\"nExclaimed the obese Scotsman and ran toward a cart filled with babynback ribs. These babies came from an illegal baby farm in Singapore,nand Dr. Evil's henchman Number Two had to brave the many horrorsnthe Singaporians threw at him. The mere mention of Singapore causednNumber Two to curl into a fetal position and suck his thumb. \"Alright ladies andngentlemen,\" Dr. Evil said, \"Here's the plan: we use the smallnpox, and we hold the world ransom for,\" he paused for drama, \"onenhundred billion dollars!\" The quasi-mad scientistnthen roused everyone into a fit of evil laughter.

Felicity and Austin are there to testify. Since they arrived back on Earth at the dawn of the new century, Felicity had endeavoured to help Austin overcome his impotence caused by the loss of his Mojo. She suspected, with her usual astuteness, that the issue was largely psychosomatic. Austin had just begun to recover. After she incapacitated Fat Bastard, another time travelling Austin visited them and the three of them had shagged all last night, just as if Austin's mojo was recovering. Now Fat Bastard was on trial and stood sullenly in the dock, surrounded by bars of reinforced titanium. How Fat Bastard could have followed them to 1999 remained a mystery. \"See that old scotchwoman Fliss?\" asked Austin, pointing out an old stooped lady who was weeping in the crowd of onlookers. \"I know – Basil told me - that Fat Bastard is her fat bastard. I's recognise the Glaswegian dialect and any poor imitation by a Canadian actor, baby.\" \"Austin, I'd rather you didn't use that offensive word,\" said Felicity, her pale cheeks flushing pink. \"You see…\" she shifted her feet and pushed her blond hair away from her face. Austin wondered what was wrong. She had seemed pale and clammy lately. \"I've been throwing up in the mornings… this timeline is a mess, but I am sure of the time frame. It cannot be yours since we only did it for the first time last night. It's Fat Bastard's.\" Austin was uncharacteristically at a loss for things to say. \"Will you tell him?\" he managed, no quip this time. \"I think he has a right to know, even though he does live up to his name…\" said Fliss. \"Although maybe… I'd better tell his mom instead.\" She went up to Fat Bastard's mother. \"Hello there ma'am,\" she said pleasantly. \"I know we've never met, but I know your son intimately…\" she paused. \"I'm Felicity Shagwell, CIA.\" The old scotch woman looked up, her streaming eyes had a startled look. \"Can ae help ye lass?\" she asked, her Glaswegian accent very strong. \"I'm pregnant. It's your son's. Your grandchild. I- I…\" Fliss stuttered to a halt. She thought that since she couldn't bring herself to tell Fat Bastard, telling his mother was her moral obligation and yet she had not intended carry the spawn of such a repulsive caricature as Fat Bastard to term and raise it, even though it was her child as much as his. The old scotch woman's eyes brightened. She threw her frail arms around Fliss and pressed her wrinkled face against her pregnant belly. \"Oh me darlin' grandchild,\" she squeaked. \"I nevae thought I'd see the day. All I ever wanted… All I needed now my son turned out to be such a basta'd. You wait lass, I'll be such a ma to you and a grandma…\" She was crying in happiness. \"Me son were such a disappointment. But everything's going to be a'right noo, my angel. With oor bairn inside ye.\" At that moment, Felicity's heart melted. She couldn't bring herself to dash the old woman's hopes and dreams. It was her baby too. She held the old woman close to her. \"I haven't picked a name yet,\" she confided. At that moment, Austin Powers came up to them. \"Hello, what's this ruckus?\" he asked frowning, his silly, ornate glasses giving him an owlish look. \"We were just pickin' oot names, laddie. For oor wee mite. Not born yet,\" said Fat Bastard's mother. She took Austin's hand in her old, gnarled one. \"Ah'm Maisie. Pleased tae meet ye. Ah'm Fat Bastard's old ma, but please don't hold that against me.\" \"You're picking out names?\" said Austin, frowning mightily. \"Yes Austin, it's decided,\" said Felicity firmly. Austin shook his head and stalked off, out of her life forever, without a second glance, in the direction of the sequel which would not contain either of the women. Felicity gasped. What did this say about Austin? Author's note: Well is Austin justified? Does Fat Bastard have the right to know he has fathered a foetus? Should Felicity have let Maisie guilt trip her into keeping it?[Chapter 2] Seeds of Fate The trial was a short one - Fat Bastard was clearly guilty of assisting Dr Evil. It was necessary however to confine him to a rhinocerous pen, where Maisie and Fliss approached him. \"Helloo ye great midden,\" said Maisie. \"Same tae ye, ye auld grosit,\" retorted Fat Bastard. Ah'm telling ye, ye've gone and made a bairn - this braw lass is expectin'\" said Maisie, coming right to the point. \"Ah don' know what yer both want, but ah was going to make babies, not eat them anymore,\" said Fat Bastard. \"Ah'll take over the warrld.\" Suddenly a glowing vortex appeared and increased to a huge size. Fliss and Maisie stepped back, blinking in astonishment, but Fat Bastard disappeared through it. \"Can you say, 'plot hole'?\" said Fliss drily. \"I think that is how Fat Bastard has been travelling in time.\" \"O' course it is,\" said Maisie. \"Ah wonder what my great bawsack of a son is up to noo? No' good ah'm thinking.\" \"He said something about taking over the world?\" Said Fliss. \"Could it be about Dr Evil? I must go through the time tunnel and stop it. Austin doesn't love me and can't be relied on. I'll do it myself.\" \"Right wi' ye,\" said Maisie. \"Ah used the same time tunnel before.\" She slipped her gnarled old hand in Fliss' and they both strode through the time tunnel together. But time tunnels are somewhat counter intuitive. Although they entered the time tunnel a short while after Fat Bastard, they arrived months later than he did. Fat Bastard had gone back to 1969, just catching the end of that liberated period, the late 'sixties. He intended to take over the world in his own way, over the next thirty years, but Maisie and Fliss would arrive to stop him during the first stage of his endeavours. The nature of Fat Bastard's scheme will become clear, but now I must tell you of events happening around London shortly after Fat Bastard's return. What Fat Bastard was doing was a secret, but there were those who now had an inkling. A new fertility clinic had opened and was offering treatment for very low prices. Now that the old traditions were overturned and sexual liberation had begun, many girls and women were choosing to become pregnant using artificial insemination, whether or not they were married. Now we will follow a new character named Becky, Becky was an investigative journalist always on the lookout for anything odd. One fine afternoon, she was hosting afternoon tea and scones for her friends. Two of them, Lacey and Lottie, had become pregnant using the services of Maximum Fertility Clinic. \"You would be surprised at how little they charged me,\" said Lacey, her wide blue eyes glowing. She had already passed the sickly phase and now she looked quite radiant. \"I know, they charged me more,\" said Lottie. \"But hubby and I could not conceive without help. My poor man is a diabetic you see,\" she said sadly. Lottie was middle aged, her brown hair now shot through with silver and she was thrilled to be accepted by the clinic at her age and even more thrilled to have become pregnant with donour sperm. But Lacey was only 18. \"I'm surprised the clinic agreed, at your age and everything dear,\" said Becky to Lacey. \"You are so young - you had plenty of time to find the right man and have children with him.\" \"I've waited long enough to be a mother,\" said Lacey, shaking her head and then brushing her blond curls away from her face. \"I really want this. There was no need to wait.\" Becky was curious about what sort of fertility clinic would accept clients as young as Lacey or as old as Lottie and was puzzled about why they charged Lacey so little. Much seemed strange about the clinic. Her journalist instincts fired up and she decided to investigate. The clinic's main building was an imposing concrete block that towered over the surrounding area. Entry was strictly for clients only. Becky met with Dr Katy Goldstein, the obstetrician, a younger surgeon with long red hair and a handsome aquiline face. Becky noticed that she was heavily pregnant. \"Practice what you preach,\" said Katy. \"Quite right,\" said Becky, shaking her by the hand. \"I would like to conceive by donour sperm right away.\" Katy nodded. \"Just slip your things off and step into the operating room. I'll be back shortly with a fresh semen sample.\" Becky waited, stark naked in the gleaming, sterile, windowless room. If Katie was fetching a fresh sample then surely the donour would have to rub one off while she waited. It had been nearly half an hour... It was cold in here and the room seemed bare apart from the large mirror. She replaced her glasses and stared at her reflection. She had a round, pale face, with piercing blue eyes and a large forehead, framed with short brown hair. Her glasses magnified her eyes, making them look rather staring. She looked up at the ventilation shaft in the ceiling, but just then, Katie returned with a vial of fresh semen, white and sticky in a syringe, and she supervised Becky as she poured it into herself. Now Becky was a client, she would be able to investigate the clinic. If only she had known whose sperm she had inseminated herself with! Felicity and Maisie were on their way and in due course, would help with her investigation.[Chapter 3] The Hatchery Two weeks later it was confirmed that Becky was pregnant and she began throwing up in the mornings. Dr Goldstein agreed to give her regular check ups for free, which Becky knew to be unusually generous for a surgeon. Becky got to meet the other patients and found out that they had all been given fresh sperm, whether or not they had a man with them to donate. Hmmm... It was always like that. Katy would leave them in the operating room and then come back with a fresh sample all ready to put into the patient. The success rate seemed to be high as well, the women she spoke to were all pregnant from their first insemination with the fresh sperm, just as she herself was. She attended an exercise class about what sort of exercises could be done during pregnancy and was intrigued by the range of patients. There were married women, lesbians, single women and the clients were of all ages and backgrounds. Literally patients of all ages visited the complex. One day, a girl with long, dark-blond hair who looked suspiciously young to Becky, passed her in the corridor and Becky introduced herself. \"I'm Lucy,\" said the girl, grinning cheerily. \"I thought there might be some problem about ID or something, like there is when getting a drink...\" here she leaned close and whispered in Becky's ear; \"I'm fifteen.\" She shook her head and wrinkled her freckled nose. \"I know you are going to say I'm too young to be a mum, but I want a gorgeous baby.\" There was a dreamy look in her green eyes for a moment as she patted her belly which was already starting to swell. Becky carefully stopped herself from delivering a lecture. Obviously fifteen was too young to be a mother. Lucy was a very pretty girl, her blond hair sleek and luxuriant, her wistful mouth perfectly formed with full lips, a cute nose and engaging smile. And her looks were only going to blossom as she got older. She did not need the responsibilities of being an underage mother, she would have been able to find any number of the best men only too glad to be her husband had she waited until adulthood to pursue motherhood. Becky kept quiet about this. Instead she voiced a question that had been playing on her mind - \"does anyone know where the sperm actually come from?\" At that moment there was a flash and a vortex appeared in the hallway. Becky and Lucy took a step backwards. Two figures stepped out of it. One was a lady of about 29 in a tight blue leotard and the other a very old lady with leathery skin. The younger lady had long blond hair and blue eyes and looked very beautiful - although... Becky frowned. Was there something wrong with her face? Well? Is there? Perhaps Hollywood would want to market her as a sex goddess nonetheless. \"This is weird!\" said Lucy. \"Alright, where are we Fliss?\" asked the old lady in a heavy Glaswegian accent. \"No idea Maisie,\" said the young woman and Becky recognised an American accent. \"You are in Maximum Fertility Clinic,\" said Becky, deciding to just roll with this turn over events. It could be a big scoop. \"There is something odd going on here. Underage girls are being given fertility treatment and the sperm is always fresh. Now tell me where you both sprang from.\" \"Yer bum's oot the windae,\" said the old scotchwoman cheerily, \"but we're from thae future, me an' me braw lass here.\" \"Wait...\" said Fliss slowly, \"Maisie, you can follow Fat Bastard to wherever he is, whenever... so what if he is here? In this fertility clinic. For all we know, he could be the donor.\" \"Ah dinnae ken,\" said Maisie. \"But ah wid have mair bairns? Good. I need tae show I learn from me mistakes. Ah could be a good mither to them.\" \"There is a repulsive caricature called \"Fat Bastard\" who has strange powers, including the unexplained ability to travel through time,\" said Fliss. \"Although he weighs one metric ton, he is capable of military service and of impregnating women. Me for one,\" she added, patting her belly. \"He works for the pantomime villain, Dr Evil, but is obviously more dangerous. He must be stopped.\" \"Aye, we'll get the big scunner if we find him,\" said Maisie. \"Come, ah'll lead, ye will follow.\" \"This is Fat Bastard's mom, but she's good,\" Fliss reassured them. They all followed Maisie down the corridor. Becky had switched on the small tape recorder she had concealed about her person for trips to the clinic. She intended to interview both these time travellers. Lucy traipsed after them. \"After all, I like an adventure,\" she said. \"I did not kick Fat Bastard in the balls hard enough, if he is impregnating all of you here,\" said Fliss. Becky wasn't sure she liked the sound of this. If it were true, what would her baby be like? They passed through several locked doors and went down several flights of stairs, following Maisie as she honed in on Fat Bastard for the final confrontation.

He tried to be evil and impress his father, but all Dr.nevil ever did was tease him and say he was semi-evil, and quasi-evil,neven the Diet Coke of evil! Just one calorie! Not evil enough!

PLLLEASSE![Chapter 2] Chapter 2: BabynShopping \"Thisnis the one! A little ugly, yes, but definitely evil.\" Dr. Evil,nFrau, and Number2 were doing baby shopping. Number2 was wearing jeansnand a polo shirt instead of his usual suit. Frau was wearing herncostume for when she visited Dr. Evil in jail in \"Goldmember\"n(blonde wig, pink shirt, jeans, shrug jacket, sunglasses, right downnto the Taco Bell bag) only this time her stomach was padded to makenher look pregnant, and she and Dr. Evil were wearing wedding rings.nDr. Evil was wearing slacks, a coat over his usual silver shirt, andna hat; and he was trying to grab a nearby toddler out of hisnstroller. Luckily for the toddler, his mother pushed the carriagenaway, saying \"How dare you call my child ugly and evil? I'll havenyou know, sir, that he's an angel! You'll be lucky if I don'tnsue you!\" Dr. Evil was stunned. \"What was HER problem? I wouldnhave paid good money for that kid!\" \"Uh….Dr. Evil,\" Number2nsaid \"Baby shopping means buying things FOR a baby, not buying anbaby.\" \"I knew that. Now let's get to that furniture store.\"nSo they walked off to IKEA, except for Frau, who was waddling behindnthem trying to figure out how to walk with that damn padding undernher shirt. But when they got to IKEA, they met with a terrible shock:nnone of the baby furniture there was evil! Dr. Evil wandered amongnthe cribs in utter dismay. \"Bears. Clouds. Balloons. Rabbits.nMoons. Isn't anything here evil? Wait- here's one with littlenyellow hand grenades!\" \"Those, Herr Doktor, are pineapples,\"nretorted Frau. In desperation, Dr. Evil walked up to a table carvednout of a dark wood. \"Here it is, gentlemen, an evil changing table!nIt even has little drawers for all the baby stuff!\" Number2 saidn\"Dr. Evil, that's a coffee table.\" It was going to be a LONGnshopping trip. Manynstores later, they finally found slightly evil furniture (well, atnleast it had no cutesy prints on it and it could be painted blacknwith little Dr. Evil logos), sort of plain baby supplies (OK, theyndon't seem to make those anymore, but let's just pretend they do,nOK?), and some black layettes at a store called GothSpawn. Now therenwas nothing but to wait a week for the baby's arrival. \"Fornthe last time, it's a BOY!!!!!\" yelled Dr. Evil at Scott. Thenbaby was due to arrive anytime that day, and they were all wonderingnwhether it would be a boy or a girl. Actually, to tell the truth,nthey were arguing over the matter. \"Look, all I'm saying is thatnit MIGHT be a girl,\" argued Scott. \"Ja, Herr Doktor, Scott couldnbe getting a sister,\" Said Frau, backing him up. \"Whatever itnis,\" Fat Bastard begged \"Can I eat it? PLEASE????\" \"NO!!!!!!\"n\"Well sorr-y,\" said the obese Scotsman. Just then, there was anknock on the door. \"I'M A FATHER!!!!\" Dr. Evil yelled as he rannto answer it.[Chapter 3] Thisnis the part where the baby finally shows up!!!! Chaptern3: Kaeoss Ensues. \"Hi.nI'm Brad, the social worker.\" Dr. Evil had opened the door andnstanding on the stoop was a zit-faced teen named Brad, the socialnworker. \"Um, hi.\" Dr. Evil replied. \"I'm from A.J.'snAdoption Ajency,\" Brad continued in his boring, annoying monotone.n\"Um, yeah, about that. We were expecting someone a little older.\"n\" Whatever. In my hometown, for us teens, it's either A.J.'s ornthe Pizza Plaza, and pizza gives me gas. Now aren't you gonna letnme in, Baldo?\" Dr. Evil sighed and let him in. \" Now, while younsign this, like, paperwork, I'll go get the baby. Yeah.\" Tennminutes later, Brad came in carrying a basket wherein lay an3-month-old Goth baby. It was in a black lace nightie and held anlittle black plush bat. Its eyes were like black pearls set into itsnlittle, round face, and its hair shone like a raven's feathers. Itneven had intricate black eye makeup(Dead Giveaway Alert!). Dr. Evilnstared at it, love slowly building up in his eyes. \"Breathtaking.nHe's so CUTE!!!\" \"Uh….about that,\" Brad monotoned. \"Quiet,nZit-boy. I'm trying to bond with my son. Shouldn't you be gettingnback to A.J.'s and looking after the other weirdo orphans? Younknow. That old chestnut.\" \"Mr. Evil,\" Brad continued. \"Dr.nEvil. I didn't go to evil medical school for six years to be callednMr. Evil, Monotone Man.\" \"OK, DR. Evil. It's a she.\" Brad hadnfinally gotten it out. Dr. Evil was stunned. \"But-but I thought itnwas a boy!\" Brad sighed. This job could be SO difficult. Oh well.nBetter to be here giving GothGirl to her psycho new family than to benin the nursery changing the octopus baby! He decided to be patientnwith them, as patient as a monotonous teenage social worker could be,nanyway. \"Yeah.nShe's a girl. Her parents were two college-student Goths.

So shenleaves her at A.J.'s like the other wierdos. Since you guys arenevil, I figured you'd be a good family for her. Court meeting in anmonth. Bye, Baldo.\" And with that, Brad left. \"SonI have a girl,\" Dr. Evil said. \"OK, that's cool.\" Just then,nthe baby started crying. \"Aw, c'mon!

The two dogs pulled apart and ran to their owners, they both wagged their tails as if they were asking to play. Victor quickly got up and got a small piece of wood from the burnt remains of the windmill and threw it towards Sparky. Sparky Jumped up and caught the wood then wobbled to Victor and dropped it at his feet. Victor picked up the wood and threw it again, Sparky ran after it only this time Persephone escaped from Elsa's arm's, Jumped up and grabbed it. Sparky was a little disappointed and he chased Persephone around hoping she'd give the wood back. Persephone dropped the wood in front of Elsa and she threw it to Victor. The four continued throwing the wood to each other and small clouds of soot shook out of them as they played. The towns people of New Holland watched as all of this was going on. They thought Sparky was adorable and that Victor's bond with him was just plain cute, Persephone looked absolutely beautiful. And Elsa well, her arrogant but caring personality completed the group. A few people even wanted to film them playing with the wood. Once Persephone saw the cameras she shook the soot out of her fur and started posing for them. The towns people just laughed and took a few pics to make her happy. \"I'd hate to break this moment of happiness,\" said Edward Frankenstein \"but, I'd like to know how this happened,\" referring to the Monsters invading the Dutch day festival and how the windmill caught fire. \"We were just trying to win the science fair by bringing something back to life\" Said Edgar. \"Edgar, I can't believe You told everyone my secret!'' said Victor \"Where's Mr. Whiskers?'' said Weird Girl in her usual monotone voice. \"that still doesn't explain why a bunch of monsters attacked the town\" said Mr. Burgermeister \"I think Shelley got miracle grow all over her when she was shocked with lighting,\" said Toshiaki \"I really don't know what happened to my sea monkeys,\" said Bob \" I did everything that was on Victor's Chalkboard\" \"You couldn't understand what was on Victor's chalkboard you Idiot\" said Toshiaki \"When did you sneak into Our house?\" said the Frankensteins \"You will not believe what I just went through\" said Nassor appearing out of nowhere. \"In light of recent events anything seems to be possible\" Said Elsa \"Point taken\" said Nassor \"Mr. Whiskers bit a bat that I was trying to bring back and he turned into this monster and flew off, has any one seen him\" said Weird Girl \"I'm sorry to say this but, he attacked me and Elsa and he burned to Death in a flaming windmill\" said Victor Weird Girl began to cry that cat was her only friend and now he's dead To be continued… I know this is a bad stopping point for this chapter but I really have to stop. Oh and I don't Know why people think Victor's dad's first name is Ben when he says that his name is Edward in the movie[Chapter 2] I got reviews! People love this!(Okay by that I mean my Fanfic not extensive authors notes before a story starts, so I'm gonna skip to the story) It was weird seeing Weird Girl cry. For one her eyes where closed and people wouldn't be surprised if she slept with them open (Well that's not saying much because like Elsa said, in light of everything that just happened you'd believe anything, but you get the point.) and when's the last time you've saw any emotion from this girl? \"I think these children have had enough for one night let's all just go home and take in the situation\" said Bob's Mom The crowd nodded and dispersed, But Weird girl stayed behind, she wanted to find what was left of her cat. After the crowd left she went to what was left of the windmill and started pushed some of the wood aside trying to look for her cat. She finally found his body in all the rubble and ashes. Weird Girl was grief stricken the second she found him. That cat that she once loved was gone, there was nothing left of that fluffy white physic kitty that she grew up with. It is the vampire cat that is dead, Mr. Whiskers never died he got lost in existence, completely vanished from the face of the earth. He is gone. There is nothing that can save him. Even if she brought the vampire cat back to life it would not be Mr. Whiskers. Her heart felt like it had shattered into microscopic pieces. No. She felt like she was dead but if she was dead she would not be with Mr. Whiskers because Mr. Whiskers never died. Weird Girl broke into more tears and cried for an hour straight. I Know this chapter is short the next will be longer, and the whole thing is not gonna be in her point of view but later I do give her a name so review this thing please![Chapter 3] Sorry if the last chapter was short this will be longer, Oh how I love it when people post reviews. I feel so happy. \" Are you sure your okay?\" said Susan as they got home. \" yes, Mom I'm fine\" said Victor as he slumped him self into the couch. But the truth was he wasn't okay. No he wasn't hurt from the burning windmill which was most likely what his mom was concerned about. He just felt REALLY uncomfortable. His secret was out and even though his parents where okay with it he still felt a bit paranoid. this is what normal is now he thought to himself you'll get used to things. Normal. Isn't that what he wanted this entire time? Normality? Wasn't the whole point of brining Sparky back to life to make things normal again? So he didn't have to live through the pain of being without him? But no, things went into the complete opposite direction. He raised the dead, got blackmailed into telling people how to do it, his secret got blabbed, people created monsters that attacked the town and he got trapped inside a burning windmill for god's sake! This is not what normal is! \"Victor is something wrong?\" asked his Mother putting a pan of muffins in the oven( yes the double Dutch cherry muffins that she tried to make before the Dutch day incident) \"yes\" said Victor with a sigh. Sparky jumped up on Victor's lap. \"what's wrong Victor\" said Susan sitting down on the couch \" It's just that a week ago everything was normal and now everything's just….. not normal\" said Victor shedding a few tears. Sometimes it's just too hard to tell people how your feeling in words. \" oh Victor you have every right to feel this way\" said Susan stroking her son's jet black hair. \" Everyone's got to get some getting used to and you and Sparky are at the center of it all\" \" I guess this is the new normal\" Said Victor smiling a little. \" No you better go wash up and when your done the will be ready\" said Susan \"Com'on Sparky\" said Victor leaping off the couch and Sparky quickly followed. If you wanna Know how I know the whole muffin thing I know almost everything about this movie even the words to praise be New Holland.[Chapter 4] So like I said in the last chapter I know all the words to praise be new Holland and here they are, Disclaimer I do not own them Praise be New Holland Streets so wide and side walks clean Modest homes at modest prices Everyone's urban dream Praise be New Holland Happy children free from tears Free from all the worlds dangers Free from crime and free from strangers In our houses tight and safe We have nothing to fear Praise be New Holland May your windmills spin for ever more Now back to the story! \" what where you thinking!\" scolded Mr. Burgermeister as they walked into the house. \" what was I thinking!? I least I didn't start an angry mob and set a windmill on fire\" screamed Elsa \" What where you even doing inside the windmill!\" screamed Mr. Burgermeister \" That bat-cat had Persephone\" screamed Elsa, this fight was getting really intense. \" If you don't remember it was stupid mutts that started this whole thing anyway\" screamed Mr. Burgermeister crossing his arms. Elsa gasped. \" How dare you insult Victor and Sparky like that!\" She screamed. Elsa had had enough of this fight, she was going to get her stuff and go to Victor's house assuming they'd let her stay which was very likely. She ran to her uncle's guest room and started getting her things. \" What are you doing?\" said Mr. Burgermeister. \" I'm packing my stuff and going to the Frankenstein's house till my Mom and Dad come home so I don't have to live with a heartless jerk!\" said Elsa Reentering the room. \" Well have fun\" said Mr. Burgermeister sarcastically. \" I will! Com' on Persephone,\" she said. She held the door open for the poodle and then slammed the door. \" want a muffin Victor?' said Susan handing her son a tray of muffins. Victor kindly took one of the tray. Sparky got up on his hind legs and jumped trying to get a Muffin. \"No, Sparky\" said Susan lifting the tray higher. Sparky was disappointed but his disappointment was short lived, cause the doorbell rang. \"I'll get it\" said Victor running to the door. He opened it and found Elsa and Persephone standing at the front porch. \" Oh, hi Elsa\" said Victor blushing a little. \" hi Victor, I was wondering if I could stay for a few days. My Uncle's being a complete jerk\" \" does he know you're here?\" said Victor \"yes he's fully aware of the situation\" said Elsa \" Okay then my parents won't mind\" said Victor \" Victor ask Elsa to come inside. You don't need to explain anything because I heard the whole conversation\" said Victor's mom from the kitchen. \" Come inside Elsa, My Mom made Muffins\" said Victor So this chapter was longer than others. You know annoys me? When people comments like: did you know Frankenweenie is the Prequel to Corpse bride? Victor Frankenstein and Victor van Dort are not the same person! Any way please review.[Chapter 5] Even though it's barely mentioned I'm still saying that I do not own corpse bride. Oh and if you plan on making double Dutch cherry muffins do not feed them to your dog, I do not know weather or not they're safe for them or not, I just added that for the sake of entertainment. Elsa and Persephone entered the room and Elsa set her suitcase by the coach. The three walked into the kitchen and Susan handed Elsa the tray. \" If Persephone wants one she can have one they're safe for dogs to eat, Victor used to feed them to Sparky all the time.\" said Susan. Elsa took two and handed one to Persephone. \" why can't he eat them any more?\" said Elsa tacking a bite of her muffin \" I guess the 'accident' destroyed his digestive system\" said Victor taking a bite of muffin. Then there was a sound that sounded like a cross between a burp and the sound water makes when spilled against concrete. \"Eeeeewwwww!\" said Susan, Victor and Elsa. In front of Sparky was a small blob of vomit. \" Persephone did you share your muffin?\" said Elsa sternly. Persephone put her tail in-between her legs and whined a little. \" It's okay, you didn't know\" said Elsa getting on her knee's and petting her dog. Susan cleaned up the mess and looked at the clock. \" kids it's ten O'clock better be off to bed\" she said and with that Victor and Elsa went and changed into pajama's ( In separate room's of course!) and Susan put an air mattress in Victor's room for Elsa to sleep on. The two kids entered the bedroom, Victor got into his bed laid down covered himself with the blanket and went to sleep. Elsa who was wearing a long white button up white night gown and had her hair loose did the same in her air mattress. 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0 In the Morning Elsa woke up to the smell of Breakfast and a Beautiful New Holland morning. She went into the dinning room and found Mrs. Frankenstein setting out breakfast \" what's for breakfast?\" said Elsa sitting down \" Last nights muffins and Microwaved toast\" Susan replied \" Victor stole my toaster\" \" Good Morning Mom an Elsa\" said Victor stretching his arms \"Good Morning Victor, Oh and I'd like my toaster back,\" said Susan \" I'll go get it\" said Victor and he ran up stairs. A few minutes later he came back with a toaster and handed it to his Mom. Susan went into the kitchen and tried to use the toaster but it didn't work. \" Edward your going to have to buy a new toaster on your way home from work!\" she yelled. Edward Frankenstein came out of his room trying to tie his tie. \" What did Victor do this time?\" said Edward bending over and picking up the newspaper Sparky was handing him. \" shocked it with a bunch of lightning,\" said Susan \" Well it went to a good cause,\" said Edward Showing her the newspaper \" he Landed on the front page of the Newspaper\" \" Let me see it\" said Victor. His dad handed him the paper and sure enough on the front page was a picture of him and Sparky playing fetch in front of the remains of the windmill with the title Friendship never dies: the story of a boy and his undead dog . But their was another story that caught Victor's attention and it something to do with a girl in his class named Fena Van Dort. 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0 (about two hours after the windmill incident) Fena trudged home crying. Her dress was covered in black soot and because it was raining her hair was soaked. Her eyes where red from all the crying she'd been doing. When she finally managed to reach her house she entered the living room and was met by her Nineteen year-old sister Lillane(who looked like a Tim Burton version of Elizabeth Gillies). Lillane hugged Her sister. \" oh my God Fena Don't you ever do that again, I was worried sick. You know you and Mr. Whiskers are all I have left\" she said. She looked at her sister and saw the tears on her face. \" what's wrong Fena? Tell Lillane what's wrong.\" said Lillane stroking her sister's hair \" Mr. Whiskers is gone and he's not coming back\" said Fena \" Fena Don't say that, we'll go look for him, we'll find him I promise\" said Lillane. \" No Lillane he got turned into a bat-cat and the bat-cat went to live with mommy and Emily\" Said Fena referring to the girl who her great great great great great great great grandpa Victor Van Dort almost married. \" don't be sad Fena I'm sure Mommy and Emily will take great care of Mr. Whiskers\" said Lillane. Fena started breathing hard and collapsed to the ground. Lillane screamed and dialed 911 on the phone in kitchen. \" don't die Fena, don't die\" she whispered to her sister waiting for the paramedics.[Chapter 6] Okay so apparently if you stick bread in the microwave it get's soggy so, I guess they had a pretty disappointing breakfast. This chapter is in Edgar's point of view which might make some people happy( well this third person so it's the narrator's point of view but you get my point) now to the story! Edgar's 13 year old sister Ninia woke him up the morning after the whole Dutch day incident. Ninia Had long black hair and wore a white dress and a black vest. There were socks on her feet but no shoes. \" Wake up,\" she screamed pulling on the covers of Edgar's bed. Edgar woke up startled, Even though his sister always woke him up like this in the morning. Ninia never did this with Felicity or Vincent their younger brother and sister. Ninia showed no respect for Edgar, her mother punished her a lot for it but Ninia never stopped. Edgar got out of bed, he was still wearing the clothes he wore yesterday, just another reason Ninia hated her little brother. \" if he took better care of him self he'd look a little less ugly\" she'd often say. The two siblings went downstairs to the Kitchen. Their 5 year old sister Felicity was sitting at the bottom of the stairs. \" Hello, Edgie\" said the little girl clutching her teddy bear. Felicity loved her brother as much as Ninia hated him. The three sat at the Kitchen table while Prudence Gore made Pancakes. Prudence sat little Vincent on the highchair. \" Good morning children\" said Prudence placing plates of pancakes on the table and handing a dry pancake to Vincent. \" good morning Mommy\" said Felicity smiling. Edgar picked up the paper and started reading. \" anything interesting Edgar?\" said Prudence \" not really …. Oh,\" said Edgar. His heart sank. \" Let me guess it's that Van Dort girl\" said Ninia \" you love her don't you?\" \" yes\" said Edgar sinking in his seat a little. \" well that's too bad. She's probably the only girl that would date a guy like you and now she's dieing. Ha\" said Ninia there wasn't a bit of sorrow in her voice. Horrified looks went across the table and Edgar was on the verge of crying. \"NINIA NOEL GORE YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!\" yelled Prudence \"YOU ARE CONSTANTLY MAKING FUN OF YOUR OWN BROTHER AND NOW YOU'VE EMOTIONLY SCARRED HIM. YOU COULD HAVE A LEAST GIVEN HIM A BIT OF MORAL SUPPORT FOR THIS TOUGH TIME IN HIS LIFE BUT NO YOU DESTROYED HIS SELFESTEM. WHAT YOU JUST DID WAS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND DOWNRIGHT CRUEL!\" Ninia frowned and slouched in her seat. Chapter 6 is done please reveiw[Chapter 7] Sorry about the wait. You know how I am, usually I post a new chapter at least every other day, but my step dad took away my computer so \" I don't spend every day locked in my room\" I'm at my dad's house typing this. This chapter is about Victor and Elsa( we'll get to Weird girl soon OK) Victor put the news paper down not bothering to read the article about Fena. Couldn't be that important, probably something about the Dutch Day incident, which was something he'd had enough of. Victor thought of something then got out of his seat and ran up stairs. Once Victor was in the attic he began searching through all the clutter. Then finally found what he was looking for and ran back down stairs. \" Sparky, look what I got!\" said Victor. Sparky looked up, in Victor's hand was a dark gray collar. Wow this chapter was short but it's been two months and I need to post something[Chapter 8] So Yes I know it's been March or April well I don't know long time no update. Really I don't know where this story is going to go. I wrote like 3 beginnings of chapter 6 before writing the chapter 6 posted on the site. Plus I found a new fandom that's constantly growing with tons of characters with more in depth personalities and history and really just awesome. Frankenweenie in my opinion is the awsomest movie ever created but is sadly kind of a dying fandom. I also have other stories that need updating. I appreciate all the love this story has gotten, I remember posting the first chapter one night and walking up the next morning with 3 reviews, that was an awesome start to one of the best days ever and I really appreciate that. It's really awesome how this story became one of the most popular stories in the Frankenweenie archive and I thank all of you for that. Like I said don't know 100% how this story is gonna go but I do know that I have the greatest fans and a working computer. :] ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Frankenweenie or its characters they belong to Tim Burton and Disney. \"We"},{"Movie":"Aristocats","Title":"Stray of the streets","Author":"DimensionTraveler23","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11081676","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hi, Bluewhisper here. I was Bluepaw, an former apprentice, but now I am a warrior of the Sierra Travelers Clan. This clan has a portal, a world portal in fact. Every clanmate chooses his /her world, and goes there, having new lives, new dreams. I, also chose a world too, you may know it; The Aristocats. Like the famous song of Scat Cat and his band sung, I have always wanted to be a cat. Cool, huh? My day came after two months of my best friend, Whiteflight's departure in her chosen world, Oliver & Company. It was getting close to summertime, and I was patrolling the south borders, checking for any trace of The South Siders gang, one of our enemies here on HQ Earth. Sunrise worries that they might strike up again once summer begins, so she ordered me and some other warriors to patrol the borders in chosen sections and shifts. The other enemies are the scientists and the government people. We were always two or three steps ahead of them, through Sunrise was concerned that we might need to stop using the portal and lay low for a while, but it never came to that, anyway. I was wearing a light blue tank top with dark brown khakis, with black/white track shoes. I was wearing my bluish-black hair in a high half-ponytail, hung in a dark green baseball cap with the name 'Colorado Rockies'. I finished up my patrol after a two-hour shift, and was heading back to Upworld House, greeting passerby on the way, and saying hellos to my clanmates inside Upworld House as I got to the elevator, zoomed down. The doors opened to the sight of many clanmates walking around, talking, eating brunch/snacks. Sunrise, who was in the middle of it all, saw me, and waved me over. I smiled, heading over, slightly tipping my head in respect. \"Hello, Bluewhisper. I trust the surface is safe in your section, then?\", asked Sunrise gently with a smile. I nodded softly, \"Yes, my leader. It is checked from the very top to the very bottom of the south borders. No sign of these rule-breaker Siders anywhere.\". Sunrise sighed, \"Excellent, Bluewhisper, my warrior. Now I believe I have something for you.\". Sunrise smiled widely as she revealed my gift, my totem necklace. Oh, It's really shiny and pretty! I stared in awe, seeing a wood-carved cat with bright diamonds for its eyes, and its tail holding a flute in mid-air, hung in a metal rod necklace. I thanked her gratefully and happily, and placed it around my neck. I then went ahead to my room. It has the number 24, right next to Sunrise's door. I came in, the floor is honey-golden polished wood, the walls full of Aristocats merchandise, my bed rose red with stitched music notes, and the bathroom has a cream sink, a white porcelain toilet, and the shower stall is of black tiles under a rain shower, and the walls painted soft orange. I got my cap off, and let my hair down, and changed it into a low ponytail with my bangs over my light blue eyes. I headed out after getting my flute and having it secured in my khakis. Sunrise and everybody else was waiting by, nodding and smiling, and even some wishing me good luck. I smirked to Sunrise, who returned the gesture as she turned the portal on, the colors usual. With a grin and nod, I leaped through the portal, landing on the tunnel floor. I looked around to see nothing, no sound until I felt a rumble under my feet, then the tunnel bursted into so many colors, and music notes going everywhere. I felt the beat in my soul, and like I was in a trance, I got out my flute, and tuned it, and put it on my lips. The famous song came, and I sounded out from my flute, note by note, dancing to it as the song captured me in its beauty of its music. Then like light came in my eyes, I saw the end of the tunnel, and saw everybody of the movie dancing and singing, and I felt like I wanted to join in too, so I did. I ran as my flute sounded out, still going to the song, and I jumped as I gave the final note, then darkness and no sound came, overwhelming me.[Chapter 2] Is that jazz music I am hearing? I woke up in a dark alley under a crescent moon, recognized the low-rent district part of Paris up above, and then I saw my tail twitch. My tail! Seeing a cracked mirror, I walked up to check my reflection. Strange, I look like a mixed cat version of Mona Lisa from the painting. I have a black stripe from my forehead to my shoulders, my pelt is ticked blue-silver tipped with a black right front paw, and a white left front paw. I have a cream-white underbelly. My eyes remain light blue. I hear the jazz music, not far off, and noticed gladly that my beloved flute is with me, so like my totem, I got my tail to hold my flute snugly as I got used to walking on paws, and went out of the alley, following the sound. As I got closer, and the music got louder and louder, I turned around the corner, and guess what? Scat Cat and his boys! And to my surprise, Thomas O'Malley is there, too, dancing. I chuckled and laughed at the moves everybody's sporting. I didn't recognize the song they're singing, and figures that it is one of the alley songs or something. I came closer, and stopped, grabbing my flute from my tail, and tuning it to their tunes, and I let go from my heart. I was in bliss, unknowing that I grabbed everybody's attention, and they became awed at the sound I was making. Scat Cat and O'Malley looked at each other, and nodded, silently agreeing on something. When I finished, opening my eyes, seeing everybody at a standstill, quiet. Opps, they are staring at me. Shyly, \"Sorry if I interrupted. I don't mean to bother you, it's just, your music makes me want to sing and dance.\". I softly spoke. \"Wow, little miss. I never heard such a beautiful sound before. Where did you ever learn to do it?\", complimented Scat Cat gingerly. O'Malley nodded, \"Yeah, how do you ever do it like that?\". with a curious smile. I embarrassingly smile, \"Well, I learned to use the flute from a young age, self-taught, actually. And when I sing or dance, I learned to let it all go from my heart. You may call me Bluewhisper.\". with a flick of my ears. Scat Cat chuckled, \"Name's Scat Cat. Miss Bluewhisper, did you ever think of joining a band? For real, I say, madam.'. I gasped, \"A band? Gee, I have wondered so much about that when I was a kit, and now, well, I wouldn't refuse a offer like that, monsieur Scat Cat, with only a wish to have a place to live and sleep.\". O'Malley laughed heartily, \"Well, I have a pad if you want a place tonight, Madam Bluewhisper, if you wish it.\". I thanked him and told Scat Cat that I accept to be part of his band, he laughed, called for his boys to introduce themselves, so they did. We all chatted a bit more until the moon was passing us over, and we all split with goodbyes, with O'Malley leading me to his pad, with my flute once again in my tail, and walking on the edges of houses until we got to his pad. I went to sleep on a pillow with my flute right next to me, curling my tail over my nose, telling O'Malley good night, and he replied back, heading to sleep on the windowsill. Well, it looks like I landed in the time before the movie, giving me some time to figure out what to alter in this world. I know Marie falls sometimes, and there's Edgar, and the barn trunk scenes. I may need to have a favor from the band once I help them or whatever. Oh, well, let's see what will happen that I'm around now.[Chapter 3] Two weeks passed, with being a teenager with Thomas, having him as a uncle-figure, making some songs with Scat Cat and the band. I was very content, until I got excited for a trip to the countryside of France with Thomas. So we got to say later to the boys, and we left on 'magic carpets', hiding and riding for a few hours. We got off at one of Thomas's favorite spots with the cat scare bit, and I was awed at the beauty of the French countryside. \"Not bad, huh, Blue?\". chuckled Thomas with a smirk. \"It's awesome, man!'. I exclaimed with a smile. Thomas laughed, and gave me a tour of his spot, hunted a bird and a hare for dinner, and under the stars we went to sleep with the sounds of my flute and chirping crickets. We continued walking, laughing, talking for a few days, the usual until the day came. I was clutching my flute in my tail as usual, with Thomas skipping alongside, getting a beat on into his alley cat song. I chuckled at his antics and saw Duchess awake and looking at him. I noticed the basket off to the side under the bridge, and jumped up along the rail behind Thomas, jumped down into the ground as I watched Duchess and Thomas. I sat not far off from the basket, as Duchess complimented his talent. At Thomas's damsel line, I commented, \"Uncle Thomas, I am a lady, aren't I?\". Thomas chuckled, \"Oh, sorry. I forgot about ya, Bluewhisper.\". \"Bluewhisper?\" asked Duchess. \"Let's say it's a family thing to have unique names for kits, which I had experienced, of course. Uncle Thomas is not true family, no, but we see each other as it, anyhow\". I commented matter of factly. Duchess nodded, then Thomas asked her of her trouble issue, then of course, the kittens came out with Marie's interruption. I chuckled at the kits's excitement, and I nudged Thomas at the leaving of Duchess and the kits. He nodded, and went ahead, did the cat scare bit with the 'magic carpet', and I landed seconds in just as Marie was given to Duchess after Thomas rescued her. An hour or so passed with a brief cream feeding for the kits, and the driver's sudden stop. I was behind Duchess when the train came, and jumped when Marie called out for her mother. Lucky I could swim. With a few quick strokes, I grabbed Marie in my jaws tightly, clutched the log in my claws, poised to jump as the jutting branch came up, and with a few false clasps, I finally secured my claws into the branch, breathing heavily as Duchess retrieved Marie from my jaws. I shook my fur out, and realized that my flute was gone from my tail. \"Holy, that was the most intense thing I has ever seen, Blue!\". exclaimed Thomas as he reached me with the boys near him. \"Are you okay, miss Bluewhisper?\", asked Toulouse quietly. \"Don't worry, kid, just out of breath\". I softly replied. \"Gee whiskers, madam, you lost your stick flute thing.\". said Berlioz surprised. Duchess gasped as she stared at me, licking Marie clean. \"Oh, dear. I'm so sorry that you lost your precious flute.\". I shrugged it off, \"It's all right. The good thing is that Marie's safe, and we're all together here\". \"Bluewhisper got a point there. And besides, Paris's waiting for us.\". chuckled Thomas with a nod. Duchess nodded as Marie thanked me gratefully, and the boys following Thomas as we went on paws once again, heading to a road. Soon, we will be in Paris in good timing. Thank goodness that Marie is safe. I got to thank Sunrise sometime for these swimming lessons she taught.[Chapter 4] The day passed with a quite interesting conversation with the others, and made it to Paris as the sun set beyond the Parisian buildings. I told the adults of the kits requiring rest after their long day. \"But what about home?\". asked Duchess worriedly. I replied, \"Duchess, we are tired. We walked quite a long way to get here. Your home can wait until morning.\". \"She's right, baby. The kids are bushed, and it will be late once we get to my pad.\". commented Thomas gently. Duchess sighed and nodded. I asked the boys as Marie asked Thomas for a ride. \"No, thank you, Miss Bluewhisper.\". replied Berlioz politely. Toulouse shook his head, \"Me neither.\". \"All right, boys. The invitation is still there if you want a ride later.\". I commented with a smile at the boys. They smiled at me, then went to follow their mother. I took the rear, following the others as we got up to the roofs, and walked for a hour or so until Thomas announced that we're close, with myself recognizing our surroundings happily. Then Scat Cat and his band sounded out, I laughed, hopping over to the pad with the kits as Thomas talked to Duchess. \"Scat Cat, we're back, and we have some guests!\". I announced loudly. \"Hey, Bluewhisper! Come down and show off some moves for us!\", replied Scat Cat with a grin. I giggled, jumping down boxes and stuff, dancing some moves to the music. Thomas yelled to Scat Cat to turn up the music as he came down with the others. Introductions came and went, and I sung along to the famous song, that's right, \"Everybody wants to be a cat\". I danced and bounced around to the catchy song, and loved Duchess's singing voice. Wow, she sounds like a angel. I waved a paw to the band who walked off, still vocalizing throughout the silence. I went to rest on a chair with a soft yet a bit worn-out pillow, and sat with my tail curled on my paws, watching the kits go right to sleep as Duchess went out to Thomas. I saw Marie getting up, and I quietly chuckled as I tiptoed up to check on her. \"You know, it was an amazing day with you and these kids. I like these kids and you, Duchess.\". replied Thomas gingerly. \"Yes, and they like you too, and it was a good day with you and your niece, Thomas.\". commented Duchess. Then came the confession/father bit, and the kits was very happy then upset when Duchess replied back with her line. The kits went back to sleep without noticing me. I came up quietly as Duchess came right back, I nodded slightly as she noticed me. She smiled sadly and quietly thanked me for everything. I smiled solemnly, then passed her by as I jumped up to the chimney shaft where Thomas was. \"Hey, Uncle Thomas.\". I whispered softly. Thomas glanced down with a twitch of his ears and tail. Thomas smiled sadly, \"You heard everything, huh?\". \"I don't blame you, Duchess and these kids are incredible. I am gonna miss them too. Gee, I thought I would have a family again.\". I replied quietly. Thomas frowned slightly, \"What do you mean, having a family again, Blue? You never say much about your past.\". I sighed and directed my eyes to the Parisian lights, \"Honestly, I never knew my folks much. Abandoned me when I was a tiny kit. Some nice people found me, and gave me my name, raised me for a while. I was happy until it happened. I was in one of these carriages, you know, riding with my humans, when a horse startled out of nowhere, and came into the way of the carriages, and everything crashed, literally. I was alone again, my humans gone, and so, with my beloved flute, I became a stray, looking for a new start, a new life, hoping for a family again until I met you and the boys.\". I replied wistfully. When I finished, I turned my head over to see Thomas shocked and slightly sad. \"I'm sorry, Bluewhisper, but hey, you're here, and I would go through today again if I want to see you again, after all, you are my niece in everything, but blood.\". whispered Thomas. I smiled, nodded, and headbutted Thomas happily, thanked him for everything he has done for me. He nodded, replied that we should go to sleep. So, we did, myself heading to sleep on my chair, and Thomas sleeping at the back end of the bed. In truth, I couldn't remember what happened, but everybody told me that my folks died in a car crash, leaving me as the sole survivor, alive somehow, and I was real young. Whiteflight, who was older than me when it happened back then, found me, and we grew up in the streets together, learning the tricks and skills we needed to survive out in New York. But now, in a new world, I got a new life, a uncle, and friends with the band. Hopefully, everything goes right in the morning tomorrow.[Chapter 5] The next morning came with a breakfast of swapped fish from the butcher, and we then went on our way, walking and talking for a hour or so until we made it to Duchess' home. I wistfully watched the kits go off to the front door as I heard Uncle Thomas and Duchess say their goodbyes. I gently headbutted Duchess as she walked past me to the front door with a sad smile. I watched Uncle Thomas' expressions as the sight almost wrenched my heart. He sighed, and told me that we should get going. I nodded, following him for a few minutes until Roquefort stopped us, telling of Duchess and the kits. \"Uncle Thomas, I will be back! We need help, and I know just who!\". I exclaimed hurriedly with my tail lashing furiously. Uncle Thomas nodded and told me to hurry as we separated, with Roquefort following my uncle to help him. I panted frantically as I smelt for any of the band's scents, and found Scat Cat's scent. With quick paws, I went into an alley. I yelled, \"Scat Cat, boys. Where the heck are you? Duchess and the kits are in trouble!\". as I looked around for any sight of them. \"Blue! We're here. What, they're in trouble?! Lead the way!\". shouted Scat Cat as he climbed out of a trash can with the rest of the band loudly murmuring. With a screech, \"Come on, boys. Hurry up!\". I turned on my paws, ran out of the alley with the band following me. We got to the mansion, and in my scent glands, I picked up Uncle Thomas's scent, and followed it quickly to the stables. I heard screeches and a loud neigh, then I saw Edgar opening the door. I grinned maliciously, screeched as I went into his face, scratching as the boys followed my motions. For minutes, feeling like hours, to my joy, I landed so many nasty scratches on Edgar until he grabbed my tail and threw me against the paddock fence. With a quick shake of my head, I straightened up to see that Edgar got stuck in Frou-Frou's harness collar, hooked up by one of the boys. I jumped to my paws, moved to the chest where Uncle Thomas was helping Duchess and the kits out. I placed the chest up to the door, positioning where Edgar should be landing. \"Ok, kick him into here!\". I shouted, and with a swift kick from Frou-Frou, Edgar landed perfectly, and I slammed the lid down, with Roquefort climbing up my fur to lock the latch into the chest, locking it tightly and swiftly. I grinned, pushing the chest out the door into view of the moving truck. I watched happily with Roquefort chuckling to himself on my head, as the moving truck went away with Edgar in their midst. I laughed as I watched Toulouse being a tiger as usual. \"Wow, what a shindig! Thanks, Blue for getting us here!\". commented Scat Cat with a chuckle. I chuckled, \"Friends should be there for each other, and you were, Scat Cat and your boys.\". \"Yeah, Scat Cat. Thanks a lot for helping us, old friend.\". replied Uncle Thomas. Scat Cat nodded, and told his boys to get going to home as he asked Uncle Thomas of a important question. \"Well, Thomas O'Malley. Looks like I was right myself. You care for her and the kits, huh?\". asked Scat Cat with raised eyebrows. Uncle Thomas chuckled, \"Nothing is stopping me now. I love Duchess and these kids. I chose to stay if Duchess's owner accepts me here.\". \"And me too, I want to have a home.\". I commented firmly. Scat Cat laughed, nodded, and hugged me and Uncle Thomas, said that he will be around. I smiled, watching Scat Cat walk off, and Uncle Thomas nudged me, to follow Duchess and the kits to the back door, meowing until Madame opened the door. We all came in, watching Madame cry happily as she reunited with Duchess and the kits. The day passed with calling Madame's friend, George Harcourt, and getting a pretty purple bow around my neck, and Uncle Thomas having his tux. We got a picture, and we proclaimed to being a family, so George added Uncle Thomas and myself into the will. Weird, cats having a will. Weird, but very wonderful. That night, we were surprised from a visit of Scat Cat and his band. I danced happily to the music, singing along. I took a breather by walking to the balcony, leaving the music behind me, and sitting on one of the lovely chairs, seeing the beautiful skyline, the stars shining with a gorgeous moon. \"I had a feeling you might be out here, Blue.\". whispered a voice, recognizing it as Scat Cat. I turned my head to see Scat Cat walking up, and jumped up close to my side. \"Sorry, Scat Cat. I just wanted to think for a while.\". I replied softly. Scat Cat commented, \"Thomas told me what happened to your flute, and well, I got something for you. Sorry that I got it out of a trashcan, but it still works pretty good.\". I turned my head, tilted questionably, then gasped as I saw a worn-out yet perfect flute clutched in Scat Cat's tail. I grabbed it tenderly, and tested the pins and sounds, then I couldn't help to go then sing out of the new flute, a melodious, beautiful song coming from my heart. When I stopped, I saw Scat Cat staring at me. \"Gorgeous. You look so glorious in the moonlight singing that song. What do you call it, Blue?\". complimented Scat Cat quietly. I giggled shyly, \"Moonlight Dreams\". \"I love it, Blue. (gulps) Bluewhisper, I was wondering if you could go out with me, just you and me alone sometime?\". asked Scat Cat nervously. Shocked and surprised, \"Scat Cat, are you asking to court me?\". With a shy look and lowered ears, he put down his hat, \"Miss Bluewhisper, I have fallen in love toward you ever since we met that day. I never seen such a unique coat like yours, and the way you sing, you are truly a heavenly cat. Yes, we may be very apart in age, but I will wait until the day you become a yearling if you want me to be yours then.\". Oh my god. I always thought Scat Cat was destined to be a bachelor forever, but falling in love with me? Well, who wouldn't? The songs he makes are so wonderful and so energetic. And the way we work together, it's like a wonderful duet of music. Harmony, you might say. I felt a warm pulse from my totem, signaling Sunrise's approval. \"Gee, Scat Cat, I never thought I would find a family here, and I did, with Uncle Thomas and the others. And you, the boys, the way we sing, it's amazing. I will love to court you on the condition to wait until my yearling day to be mates then. Do you agree on that, Scat Cat?\". I replied excitedly. Scat Cat smiled, nodded, \"Yes, I agree, Bluewhisper.\". He then put back his hat, and flicked his tail into mine as my new flute laid beside us. He licked my ears gently as I nuzzled against his chest, purring happily and loudly. We sat there in the chair for awhile until Duchess and Uncle Thomas came out, seeing us together. We told them of our love and condition, and they accepted happily, calling the kits over, telling them that Scat Cat is part of the family now. They cheered loudly, and we laughed at their excitement. We went back into the party, grabbing my flute to join in with my love's horn, the music happy and loud. We then stopped later into the night, licking my love goodbye as he and his boys went back to downtown, and I went to sleep on a separate bed from the others' bed. What a happy ending! I got a uncle, a aunt-in-law, cousins, and a new love in Scat Cat, wonderful friends in the band and more. Who knows what awaits me in the future?[Chapter 6] Sunrise's P.O.V. Sure enough, Bluewhisper and Scat Cat became mates on her birthday, or \"yearling day\", as Scat Cat calls it. She became a mother a few months later to four beautiful kits, two boys and two girls. The firstborn being a girl is Scarlet, blue-eyed with her father's colors and her mother's silky build, grew into her own rose red bow. The second born being a boy is named after one of Thomas O'Malley's middle names, which is Casey. He has the stocky build of his father, also eyes from him, and has a cream underbelly, with tortoiseshell gray and bluish-black fur. He grew into wearing a green-trimmed bow. The third born being a girl is Dancer, named for her early dancing moves at birth. She is blue-eyed, an copy of her mother; with a exception which is that she has white socks on all her legs. She received a lovely silver collar with rubies stitched in it. Finally, the last born being a boy is Bruno, on Scat Cat's insistence that one of the kits should have a alley name. He is a nearly copy of his father with bicolored eyes, the right eye is dark amber while the left eye is light blue. He got a dark blue trimmed hat. Dancer enjoys dancing with her sister-friend, Marie while Scarlet plays the flute with her mother, Bluewhisper. Casey loves to sing with his namesake and his father, and his brother-friends, Toulouse and Berlioz. Bruno, to everyone's surprise, can act. He listens to Madame's reel tapes of her plays, and can remember every motion perfectly. Madame has a feeling that Bruno is going to be one of the famous animal actors in the world ever. Duchess loves to watch him act, and encourages him to practice. The band visits every chance they got, and came to enjoy the kittens's antics and talents. Frou-Frou and Roquefort loves the kittens too. Madame got a new butleress, a lovely woman of her late 20s, brown haired with light green eyes, and her name is Katherine, just recently moved from USA to look for jobs with animals. She loves all everyone, and they accepted her, slowly came to love as well. Bluewhisper told me that she never thought she would find a happily ever after ending for herself, but now she is, to my joy and happiness. Indeed, everyone is happy and finding their stories through the family and talents. ","Summary":" Hi, Bluewhisper here.

I am also obsessed with the amazing Austin Powers trilogy. I decided I should add on to the unfinished series starting where we left off (Evil Scott). I don't really give a flying rat's assif you think my story sucks, but if you do happen to like it, I would be delighted to get a review from you. NOW READ IT YOU BLASTED FOOL! Disclaimer: Unfortunately I do not own anything to do with Austin Powers. If I did own it I would have the most genius mind of comedy in the world! I however do not. The only thing I do own is the plot to my story. Chapter 1: The Kidnapping …………………………………………………………………………………………… In his California apartment, Dr. Evil leaned back in his rotating chair and waited for his long lost brother, Austin Powers, to arrive. Since the two enemies discovered that they were in fact related, Austin had insisted on rather annoying weekly visits. (Phone rings and Dr. Evil nearly shits his pants) \"Who the hell is this?\" he asked. \"Basil! I thought I told you to stop calling me! I will not let you barrow my 'Time Machine' to redo the all dates you've skrewed up! Throw me a frickin bone here!\" Basil: \"Dr. Evil, Its Austin! Turn the TV on to channel 7!\" (Flips through channels until he comes to number 7) Blonde TV Reporter: \"Hello New York!\" Brunette TV Reporter: \"(whispers) This is California dumb ass!\" Blonde TV Reporter: \"Ah, so it is. I am Marry Turner and to my left…. right…. is Farah Swan, from the nightly California News.\" Brunette TV Reporter: \"Anyway, yesterday morning police discovered that Austin Powers, British Shaggadelic International Spy, was missing from his groovy pad. Blonde TV Reporter: \"Later that day, police informed us that after a thorough search of San Francisco, they were unable to find Austin. However today, around 5 o' clock, we received this ransom clip.\" Clip: (Shows Scott sitting in a dark room on a rotating chair) \"Frau if you would just press the damn record button we could get this over with! Oh, you did? Why didn't you tell me! Um, Good evening world. I am Dr. Scott Evil, son of the stupid and no longer evil, Dr. Evil. I have here with me the famous Austin Powers. No need to fret you shall eventually get him back. All you need to do is pay me 1 Trillion Dollars by Friday at midnight. If you fail to ' Give me the money', I shall have no choice but to kill your precious Powers. I shall contact you again near the end of the week. I think you understand me. Mwahahaha, Mwahahaha! ……… Ok Frau I need to take a piss. I'll be back in a minute. Hey turn the camera off!\" (Screen goes dark). Brunette TV Reporter: \"As you see, this is no laughing matter. If we cannot find the 1 Trillion dollars, the sexy Austin Powers will be killed.\" Blonde TV Reporter: \"And if they kill him, he wont be able to host anymore shaggadelic parties!\" (gasps). \"Oh my god! We need to find that money fast! Anyway, we shall keep you posted as the crime progresses. This was the New York …..\" Brunette TV Reporter: \"California!\" Blonde TV Reporter: \"Right! The California News Update. Tune in next time to hear about any more information on the story. Marry and Farah saying goodbye…….. Goodbye.\" (Dr. Evil stares open mouthed at blank TV screen) \"Scotty does?\" he whispered. \"Dr. Evil? Dr. Evil, can you hear me now?\" \"Yes Basil.\" \"Good. Now Dr. Evil, are you willing to help us locate your son and save your brother?\" \"Oh, um, of course.\" \"Smashing! Dr. Evil, meet me at the lab tomorrow morning so we can tell you our plan of action. Until then I guess! Goodbye Dr. Evil.\" \"Right, farewell.\" (hangs up phone)[Chapter 2] Ah yes the second chapter. Review if you like, Fuck off if you don't. Disclaimer : I own nothing but the plot of the story. Keri Kaviani is actually one of mybest friends and I felt like embarrasing her in front of millions. I luv you Keri remember (not that way you pervert). The Mission: \"Mini Me! What did I tell you about humping the motorcycle!\" Dr evil exclaimed pulling his clone away from the orange bike. They were standing outside the S.H.I.T., or Spy Headquarters for International Transgressions. Basil had told them to wait for him outside the door. \"Where is he? We've been standing here for 2 whole minutes! My legs are going to give out!\" Dr. Evil complained as he collapsed on a short stone wall. Then he began to think about Scott's recent attempt for World control. …………. Day Dream: \"Scott, I'm so proud of you! I always knew you would take over the business for daddy!\" Dr. Evil skipped towards his son who was sitting on a throne like chair. \"Scotty, daddy's come to help you!\" Scott pulls out a gun and points it at Dr. Evil screaming, \"You caused me psychological harm! DIE!\" ………… \"Dr. Evil? Dr. Evil are you listening?\" \"No Scotty! It wasn't me who put the road kill in your bed! I Swea- Oh Basil. Hello.\" \"Um, shall we proceed?\" said a nervous Basil. \"Oh, Right. Follow me Mini Me!\" The two and a half men strolled quickly into the S.H.I.T. As they made their way to the 'Kidnapping Room', Basil gave a hurried tour of the S.H.I.T. \"This is The Water and Sewage Lab. Yes that's where the smell is coming from. And this is the Illegal Porno Lab…\" \"EEEEEEEEEEE.\" Mini Me squealed and ran towards the door. \"No Mini Me down! Down!\" Dr. Evil exclaimed as he dragged his clone away from the door. \"Ah, and here's our stop!\" Said Basil opening a door to the right and letting them in. \"We searched far and wide for the best person to help you in your mission, but came up rater short. Anyway, I would like you to meet your partner, Keri Kaviani. Keri abandoned her friends and family so she could date your son. She got rather pissed off when he decided to take over the world, so she came to aid us in his capture.\" \"Hello Dr. Evil\" Keri stood up and shook Dr. Evil's hand. She had lengthy brown hair that was pulled up into a loose bun. She was slim and rather tall, but the tallness was from her green 3in. boots. The only problem was her attire. She was wearing a loose red spandex suit under a baggy blue sweatshirt. Her boots reached to about her knees, but you could just see the pink and orange knee-highs peaking out from their green dungeon. \"Right.\" Dr. Evil drawled looking over Keri's outfit. \"Nice to meet your clothes- I-I mean meet you. Wait your clothes are nice, but I meant to say you. Not that I didn't like to meet you clothes. Yes. What were you saying Basil?\" \"You and Ms. Kaviani will be working together.\" Basil explained.\" Now we have required some information about Dr. Scott's whereabouts. He seems to have built a lair deep inside Mt. Everest. You and Ms. Kaviani will need to find the entrance and infiltrate his lair.\" \"I see. Do we get a rocket or something to get there?\" Dr. Evil questioned.[Chapter 3] Oh look at this. It's the next chapter. Yes I am aware it is short. GET OFF MY BACK. My ADD did not allow me to write anymore. A deep thanks to all those 5 people who reviewed last time. Remember to review or I will be forced to jinx you. Disclaimer: I own nothing of the characters. As you may remember Keri is my friend and yes I'm using the real her for the story so you may not take her. Keri I swear I do not ummmm... dislike your clothes. You have ummm wonderful taste! First Day on the Road: \"I AM NOT GOING TO DRIVE TO MT. EVEREST!\" Dr. Evil protested as they walked up to a pale pink car. \"Wait no I changed my mind. I WON'T DRIVE TO MT. EVEREST IN A PINK AUTOMOBILE! IT WILL MAKE ME LOOK QUEER! I MEAN THROW ME A FRICKEN BONE HERE!\" \"Dr. Evil please stop yelling and let me explain.\" Basil said stopping Dr. Evil's ranting. \"It seems that we have run out of cars and rockets. Your brother crashed them all.\" \"Typical. Ok new plan. We save Austin from Scotty then I'll blind him with a lazer pointer to punish him for making me temporarily gay!\" Dr. Evil demanded. \"Mooohahahaha Moooohahahaha Moo-\" \"Well what you do after the mission is you choice completely.\" Basil interrupted. \"Now I suggest you get going.\" \"Right then.\" Keri said. \"After you Dr. Evil.\" \"DO NOT TREAT ME LIKE A QUEER!\" \"Of course Dr. Evil. I shall go first.\" …………………………….. \"Ok I think we're lost.\" Dr. Evil sighed as he scanned his map. \"Well let me look at it.\" Keri suggested. \"NO! ITS MY MAP!\" \"I just want to check that we're going the right way.\" \"NO ITS MINE!\" Keri pulled off on the side of the road and got out. She walked around to Dr. Evil's side and dragged him out of his seat. He sat dumbly on the ground looking stoned. \"Dr. Evil, If you don't give me the map right now me and Mini Me are going to leave you all alone right here in the desert.\" Keri explained coolly. \"But it's my map.\" Keri walked behind Dr. Evil and kicked him squarely in the back. He dropped the map and ran into the car yelling. \"IT'S JUST A FRICKEN MAP! THROW ME A FRICKEN BONE HERE!\" Keri got back into the drivers seat and began to analyze the map. \"I think I know why we're lost.\" She began furiously. \"This is a map of Cedar Point Amusement Park!\" \"Well you told me to get a map.\" \"A map of the world you idiot!\" \"Oh.\" ……………………………… For about a day they drove down that deserted desert road. They passed no one, they saw no one. Finally Mini Me spotted a small motel off to the side of a rather large cactus. He began to alert his comrades. \"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\" He squealed pointing at the motel. \"Mini Me this is no time for a massage.\" Dr. Evil replied exasperatedly. \"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\" \"NO! No massage Mini Me. OUCH!\" Mini Me jabbed Dr. Evil in the head with a very sharp pencil. \"KERI PULL OVER! MY BALD HEAD HAD BEEN POISIONED WITH LEAD!\" He screamed as he flung open the car door and rolled out. Keri and Mini got out of the car to find Dr. Evil ferociously rubbing his head against a cactus. Suddenly he let out a high-pitched scream and began to pluck the spines out of his skull. \"Oh look I see a motel!\" Keri stated as she too spotted the shack of a lodging place. \"Is that what you were trying to tell us Mini ME?\" \"EEEEEEEEE\" \"Ok well let's go check it out.\" She declared. Then Mini Me and Keri left Dr. Evil all alone crying over with aching poisoned cranium.[Chapter 4] My next addition. Ah, I fell so pleased with myself. REVIEW OR I'LL SET MY GOBLIN HORDE AFTER YOU! Disclaimer : None of this I own except the plot. Keri is my one of my best friends and Laura is my other best friend. She wished to be in it. I think I'll add the other two of our group of five to the story. OH YES! Lori is myself. Lori tis my real name. Laura's Idea: (Meanwhile in Dr. Scott's Lair) \"LAURA!\" Scott screamed to his girlfriend. \"Where's my coffee!\" After his preppy and nerdy girlfriend Keri had left him, he met Laura. Laura had been in a local pub and was thrown out from beating the bartender up for cutting her off. Scott and Laura became fast friends. Laura was as evil as he was, probably even eviler. She didn't take shit from anyone. \"LAURA! Hurry up!\" \"Coming Scott\" Laura replied with a false smile. She had long blonde, almost white hair. Unlike Keri, she was in no way a dork. She wore a black vampires corset gown, with a black silk lace up front. The bottom of the gown was ragged and frayed. Her eyes were surrounded by a heavy layer of eyeliner and her lips a pale gray color. To top off the outfit she had high leather boots with a skull and cross bone on the toes. She swept over to Scott and sat on his lap. \"Let me help you with this dear.\" She said sweetly. Then she stood up and poured the scalding hot coffee on his balls. Scott screamed like a little girl and ran off to change. \"Ok Number 2, tell me about this evil plan Scotty has.\" She said urgently. \"Well, I think it's brilliant.\" He confessed. \"Dr. Evil could never think of it. Scott has kidnapped Austin Powers knowing that his dad will come to save him. When his dad shows up, Sr. Scott plans on planting a microscopic bomb, designed to look like a pimple, on his father's face. Once the time is right, Scott shall blow his father and uncle up.\" \"Scott thought of that?\" Laura said her mouth hanging open. \"I thought he was a brainless git.\" \"Well actually he has a partner in this scheme that thought of the plan, but he won't tell us who it is.\" \"Well I'll just have to get it out of him wont I?\" Laura smirked deviously. ……………………………………… \"Hello my name is Lori, can I interest you and your midget in one of our honeymoon suites?\" The hotel clerk droned without looking up from her book. \"Um, no I don't think so.\" Keri snapped as Mini Me squealed in delight. \"I'm actually looking for a place with two bedrooms.\" \"So you and the Midget aren't going at it tonight?\" Lori quizzed with a disapproving look at Mini Me. \"NO WE ARE NOT!\" Keri yelled. \"I am here on business with my partner and his clone. We are looking for a room to stay. Are there any open?\" \"Yeah sure.\" Lori mumbled as she pulled a room key from a box under her desk. \"Room 12 in the back. Come up here in the morning to check out and pay.\" \"Thank You!\" Keri fumed and they stormed out of the office. They met up with Dr. Evil at the car. His eyes were a little puffy and his head was a light purple color. Looked as though someone bashed his head rather than cactus spines. \"Dr. Evil, are you ok?\" \"Yes I'm perfectly fine except for the fricken sharp pains now going through my fricken head!\" he yelled. \"Have you been crying?\" \"No! I got a fricken cactus spine stuck in my eye!\" \"Oh….. Well I got us a room for the night.\" \"Whoop-de-do Keri!\" Inside the hotel Keri set up her computer and began to check her email. Dr. Evil and Mini Me retreated to their room swearing under their breath. After a few minutes of deleting shit mail Keri came across a video clip labeled \"Austin Power's Ransom Video 2\". \"Dr. Evil!\" She yelped. \"Come here quick!\" Dr. Evil rushed out of his room wearing a blue night cap and pink fuzzy boxers. \"What the hell is it?\" Clip: (Shows Scott sitting on his rotating chair next to another lady in a winged armchair.) \"Hello again, this is Dr. Scott Evil and this is my lovely assistant Laura Copp. We have come here to tell you about the change in our plans. See-\" \"Let me tell them Scotty.\" Laura interrupted. \"As you wish dear.\" \"It has come to our attention that the S.H.I.T. has sent out a rescue team to bring Mr. Power's to safety. In light of this recent discovery, we now demand our money by tomorrow night. If you fail to meet our demands, I shall be forced to kill your hero. I suspect you understand this. Have fun…..\" \"That was wonderful dear!\" Scott said in delight as he stood up to leave. \"Oh shut up you idiot. I only did that so you wouldn't get your ass fried into bacon.\" Laura snapped. Whacking Scott over the head, causing Scott to run around blindly. \"At least I stopped you from releasing our plan to-\"(Scott runs into camera and screen goes black.) (End of clip.) \"SHIT! What is their fricken plan!\" Dr. Evil spat. \"Well, I don't know, but I'm puzzled on how they knew what we were doing.\" Keri wondered. \"Who cares! I just want to go back to bed.\" \"Night Dr. Evil.\" \"I AM NOT QUEER!\" ","Summary":" Austin Powers 4: Scotty's Revenge Yes hello.

Por suerte, fue un cambio positivo. Cuando todo el pueblo vio ese día a Sparky abrir los ojos luego de ser revivido y ver a su dueño abrazarlo emocionado, comprendieron que estaban en un error, que aquel perro no era un monstruo. Lo mejor de la situación, fue que al poco tiempo, la vida en Nueva Holanda volvió a ser la misma de siempre. La gente volvió a su misma rutina, aun sabiendo que entre ellos vivía ahora alguien muy diferente. Esto alegraba mucho a Víctor, pues el se imaginaba toda la represión que sufriría después de lo que pasó, pero no ocurrió nada. Así pues su vida volvió a ser la de siempre, cosa que le agradó bastante. Pero vendría pronto un día en que su vida tendría un giro inesperado, algo lo sacaría de la rutina y transformaría sus sentimientos.[Chapter 2] 2- Giro inesperado Como cada tarde antes de que el sol se ocultara por completo, Víctor sacó al patio a Sparky para jugar con el. Mientras Sparky corría por el jardín y se dirigía a buscar su pelota favorita, Víctor escuchó un leve sollozo del otro lado de la cerca. Era una voz de niña. - ¿Elsa? – dijo Víctor mientras caminaba hacia la cerca y se paraba en la punta de sus pies para lograr ver algo. Fue en vano, pero así logró que su voz se escuchara mejor al otro lado. - ¿Elsa? – repitió. Nadie le contestó los primeros segundos, después la misma voz que lloraba respondía algo entrecortada. - Hola – se escuchó. Tal como Víctor lo pensaba, la voz era de Elsa - ¿Qué haces afuera? - Juego con Sparky – respondió Víctor. - Bien por ti – fue la respuesta de Elsa. - ¿Estabas llorando? – preguntó Víctor - No – mintió Elsa, a modo de no preocuparlo - Oí una voz llorando – le dijo Víctor No hubo respuesta, unos segundos después, se escuchó nuevamente a Elsa llorar. - ¡Bueno, para que te miento! ¡Si estoy llorando! – soltó Elsa entre lágrimas - ¿Hay algo que pueda hacer? – preguntó Víctor preocupado. Antes de que le pudieran contestar, una voz casi tronando le exigió a Elsa entrar a su casa. No había que romperse la cabeza pensando para saber que era su tío. - Lo siento – dijo Elsa y entró en su casa - Adiós – respondió Víctor Luego de esa conversación, Víctor perdió los ánimos para jugar y solo reaccionó a abrazar a su perro sintiendo que una pena profunda le llenaba el corazón, sin saber por qué.[Chapter 3] 3- ¿Qué me está pasando? Esa noche, Víctor no lograba conciliar el sueño, a cada instante de intentar que sus ojos se cerrarán, solo conseguía abrirlos más. Sparky en cambio, dormía placidamente bajo la cama de su dueño, estaba muy cansado. Víctor no había dicho ni una palabra a sus padres sobre su dialogo con Elsa, pero sentía que se los tenia que contar, era algo personal, pero a la vez que se debía saber. Estos pensamientos solo le fueron quitando más el sueño, así que intentó no pensar más en ello. Eso fue lo que poco a poco lo fue haciendo caer en un sueño profundo y cerrarle los parpados. Elsa tenia la misma sensación esa noche, no solo por el hecho de haber desahogado parte de su dolor en Víctor, sino porque además otros recuerdos le llegaban a la mente. Nunca más quitaría de su cabeza el recuerdo de cuando la muerte pasó por su lado y de no ser por Víctor que la salvó a tiempo de caer desde el molino en llamas, tal vez ni siquiera estaría ahora pensando en eso. El otro recuerdo que la abrumaba con intensidad fue el de ver a Víctor caer por culpa de ese monstruoso gato vampiro desde una altura espantosa, atravesar el tejado de madera y perderse en las llamas del interior del molino. Aun sentía como si lo viviera en ese momento. Sentía que el corazón se le paraba de miedo y dolor, ver a alguien de tan buen corazón, tan sensible y que no merecía morir, caer así de fuerte, era algo que hizo que su alma se fracturara. Pero luego llegaba el recuerdo de cuando vio a Sparky sacarlo del molino aun con vida, esa imagen calmó su corazón, podía seguir con la calma de que él aun estaba con vida. Estos recuerdos la abrumaban fuertemente y no tardaron en hacerla soltar las primeras lágrimas, las cuales extrañamente se silenciaron al recordar su corto dialogo en el jardín. El solo hecho de recordarlo la hacia sentir gozosa. Pero de pronto su corazón experimentó una nueva emoción que nunca había conocido. No lo sabia, pero al parecer, se estaba enamorando. En vez de alegrarse, se puso a llorar en silencio. Si su tío se enteraba de esto… tal vez le prohibiría volver a ver a Víctor, ella sabia muy bien lo mucho que su tío odiaba al niño y a su perro, aun cuando le salvaron la vida a Elsa. Por ende, optó por callar sus emociones. Se podría decir, que esa noche, los únicos que durmieron tranquilos fueron Sparky y Persephone, la perrita de Elsa.[Chapter 4] 4- En clases Cuando la campana de clases de la escuela de Nueva Holanda resonó fuertemente, todos los niños entraron a la escuela, algunos más apresurados que otros, pero con el mismo objetivo; no llegar tarde a clases. Siendo un día lunes, la primera clase del curso de Víctor era lenguaje. La profesora de esta asignatura les explicaba el significado de la poesía y la mitad del curso dormía y los demás escuchaban admirados la explicación, en esta ultima mitad estaba Víctor, pues era muy entusiasta en todas las clases, aún cuando no eran de ciencia. Pero ese día hubo un momento en que las cosas se convirtieron en una nueva enigma para Víctor. Fue en el momento en que la profesora les pidió a los alumnos que escribieran un poema. Fue en ese preciso minuto, en que todo dio un vuelco inesperado. Solo contaban con 20 minutos para inventar el poema, así que todos se concentraron y comenzaron a pensar en algo que los apasionara. 20 minutos después… - ¡Muy bien, el tiempo acabó! – dijo la profesora, recibiendo por respuesta un leve desgano por parte de los alumnos. - Ahora quiero que tres de ustedes lean lo que escribieron – ordenó la maestra. Pero la reacción del curso fue esconder la cabeza para no hacerlo. Ante esto, la profesora decidió elegir al azar. - Está bien, quiero que Bob lea el suyo – dijo la profesora. Todos giraron la cabeza hacia el puesto de Bob, esperando que realizara lo pedido. Bob solo dijo: - Aaamm… eehh… um… aaahhh… ¿ya dije eehh? Todo el curso no pudo evitar reírse ante la improvisada respuesta de su compañero. - ¡Muy bien, dejen de reirse! ¡Bob, no juegues así otra vez! ¿De acuerdo? – exigió la profesora. Bob solo asintió con la cabeza y todos guardaron silencio. – Muy bien, ahora quiero que Víctor lea el suyo. Una vez que la profesora lo dijo, todos los ojos de los niños giraron y se posaron sobre Víctor, él cual sin estar nervioso se puso de pie y recitó su poema: \"Una noche muy helada Y con la lluvia fuertemente cayendo A favor de la oscuridad En el cielo vi una chispa Tan hermosa como un lazo de amistad Cuando salí a verla Le pregunte suavemente que era Ante lo cuál ella se limitó a decir: Soy la señal más brillante De que algo nuevo está por venir\" Todo el curso enmudeció, era un texto con un mensaje implícito y a la vez muy hermoso. - ¡Eso fue muy creativo! – comentó la maestra – me asombra lo bien que lo haces, Víctor. Sigue así y llegarás lejos. Puedes sentarte. Víctor asintió con la cabeza, se sentó en su lugar, juntó sus manos y esperó tranquilamente a que otro compañero leyera. - Para finalizar la actividad, quiero que Elsa lea su poema – fue la ultima instrucción de la maestra. Elsa se puso de pie, miró algo nerviosa a sus compañeros que la observaban muy atentos, luego miró a la maestra y comenzó a recitar su texto lírico: \"Busco tus ojos profundos Por si quieres decirme algo Y por algún motivo Creo que me has olvidado. Pero sé que me equivoco Porque ayer me hablaste con ternura Y aunque estaba llorando Agradecí el poderte escuchar Y todavía siento dolor Porque no puedo amarte Pues no me lo permiten Y tu no lo sabes\". Esta vez, el curso guardó silencio, pero Toshiaki comenzó a reírse bajito. - ¿Cuál es el chiste Toshiaki? – le preguntó seriamente la profesora. - Es que es demasiado exagerado, es como si alguien se muriera por amor ¡Qué estupidez! – contestó Toshiaki riendo en voz más alta - ¿Y qué hay de Romeo y Julieta? – preguntó Chica Rara - Eran jóvenes y confundidos – contradijo Toshiaki Toda esta burla le cayó a Elsa como si la hubieran apuñalado. Se tragó con esfuerzo las ganas de llorar. - De todos modos no tienes derecho a burlarte así de tu compañera Toshiaki – reprendió la maestra a Toshiaki en tono de advertencia, luego su atención se dirigió hacia Elsa – Jovencita, su poema esta muy bien construido. Te felicito por tu trabajo. Ahora te puedes sentar. Elsa obedeció lo dicho y luego cubrió su cara con un libro para que nadie viera que estaba llorando en silencio. Pero Víctor evadió ese obstáculo y la vio llorar, provocándole un vacío en el estomago. Unos minutos después sonó una campana y los niños salieron de la sala para descansar en el recreo. La primera clase llegaba a su fin. En cuanto salió de la sala, Víctor buscó a Elsa, necesitaba saber como estaba. El incidente en clases lo había dejado preocupado por ella, además fue el único que la vio llorar y eso lo hizo sentirse extraño. La encontró junto a la puerta de la escuela, escondida la cara y los brazos cruzados. - ¡Elsa! – exclamó Víctor. Ella lo miró, tenía una expresión de dolor en sus ojos. - ¿Estas bien? – preguntó él. Ella no le contestó, pero nuevas lágrimas corrieron por su cara. - No voy a permitir que se burlen de ti otra vez, no si puedo evitarlo – le dijo Víctor al ver la expresión triste de Elsa, como un intento de calmarla. Elsa afirmó con la cabeza, pero no dijo nada. -Quédate tranquila, estarás bien – concluyó Víctor. A modo de despedirse, puso su mano en el hombro derecho de Elsa, la miró y sonrió brevemente. Luego dio media vuelta y se fue. En cuanto él se alejó, Elsa sonrió levemente y olvidó de a poco su pena. El hecho de que Víctor fuera gentil con ella, la hacia sentirse mejor, pero que ahora estuviera dispuesto a defenderla de las burlas la dejaba sin palabras. Sentía deseos de decirle gracias, pero su miedo a que el la rechazara o no le volviera a hablar, era lo que retenía sus palabras.[Chapter 5] 5- Al final de la jornada Víctor, el que siempre aprobaba en exámenes y pruebas, quien ayudaba aún cuando después lo ignoraran, el chico que admiraba la ciencia y el genio de la creatividad en inventos y cinematografía. Y ahora sentía que todas las virtudes que lo convertían en la persona que era, ahora quedaban muy pequeñas al lado de sus emociones. Víctor quería evitar que Elsa sufriera, pero no era por lastima, no sabia por qué. Todo lo que sabia era que cuando Elsa sufría o lloraba, el sentía ese mismo dolor, como si su corazón fuera parte del de ella. Sintió la necesidad de hablar con sus padres, solo ellos lo entenderían y tal vez ayudarían a comprender lo que le estaba ocurriendo. Aunque estos pensamientos daban vueltas y vueltas en su cabeza, afortunadamente no lo distrajeron durante las clases. Al llegar la hora de salida, todos recogieron sus libros y pertenencias y se fueron a sus casas. Como casi siempre, Víctor no tenia ninguna prisa y mientras llegaba hasta su bicicleta estacionada afuera del colegio, observó preocupado como Elsa iba caminando bastante distraída, pues no notó una piedra en el suelo, tropezó bruscamente con ella y se cayó. Víctor inmediatamente corrió hacia ella. - ¿Estás bien? – le preguntó preocupado. - No lo sé – contestó Elsa y al intentar pararse se volvió a desplomar - ¡No, me torcí el tobillo! - No te muevas – dijo Víctor – te puede doler más. Ella lo escuchó y se quedó quieta. - ¿Y ahora como me iré a casa? – se preguntó Elsa en voz alta – es mucho que caminar, será peor aún. Víctor inmediatamente comenzó a pensar en una solución. No podía dejarla sola. Giró la cabeza en un gesto rápido y en cuanto vio su bicicleta, supo que tenía que hacer. - Te puedo llevar en mi bicicleta – le sugirió a Elsa – Te subes atrás. Así no tendrás que caminar. - Pero no quiero incomodar – murmuró Elsa. - No es nada – respondió Víctor – Quiero que llegues bien. Me preocupa tu estado. - Podemos intentarlo – dijo Elsa Víctor la ayudó a pararse y avanzar hasta su bicicleta, la cual estaba a siete pasos de ambos niños. Víctor se subió primero a la bicicleta y Elsa se subió detrás de él con cuidado. - No te vayas a soltar – le aconsejó Víctor – sujétate bien. - De acuerdo – respondió Elsa, luego se abrazó a Víctor para no caerse y ambos partieron hacia sus casas. Aunque fueron lento, llegaron a sin problemas. Cuando Víctor detuvo la bicicleta, Elsa intentó bajar, pero en cuanto lo hizo y dio dos pasos hacia su casa, nuevamente sintió un punzante dolor en el tobillo. - ¡Auch! – exclamó Elsa - ¡Todavía me cuesta! - Espera un poco – le contestó Víctor. Se bajó de la bicicleta y la dejó sobre el césped. Luego ayudó a Elsa a avanzar hasta la puerta de su casa. - Gracias – le dijo Elsa a Víctor cuando llegaron a la puerta de la casa – no sé que hubiera hecho si no me hubieses ayudado. - No es nada – contestó Víctor – Si necesitas ayuda en algo, solo dímelo. - Pero no te quiero molestar – dijo Elsa algo nerviosa - No es ninguna molestia – le aseguró Víctor. - ¿Sabes una cosa? – le confesó Elsa – Me siento feliz saber que por lo menos le importo a alguien. A ti. Víctor se sonrojó levemente. No se esperaba algo así. - Me importas mucho – contestó él. Elsa lo miró a los ojos y lo abrazó. Víctor nuevamente se asombró, pero también la abrazó. - Mejor ve a tu casa – le dijo Elsa al terminar de abrazarlo – Ya sabes como es mi tío. - Lo sé – contestó Víctor. Ambos se despidieron. Luego Víctor recogió la bicicleta que había dejado en el césped, le hizo un ultimo gesto de adios a Elsa y se fue a su casa. Dejó la bicicleta junto a la pared como acostumbraba hacerlo, entró al patio y saludo a Sparky. - Hola amigo ¿Cómo estás? – dijo Víctor alegremente. Sparky contestó con ladridos de felicidad. Pero su felicidad fue cortada bruscamente. Pues escuchó los gritos del Sr Burgemeister y comprendió que estaba reprendiendo a Elsa. - Lamento llegar tarde – se disculpó Elsa. - ¡No me vengas con excusas! – contestó su tío - ¡Apuesto a que estabas perdiendo el tiempo con ese bueno para nada! - ¡Se llama Víctor! – corrigió Elsa con un tono realmente enfadado – Y gracias a él llegué bien aquí. Hubo una pausa. - Me tropecé cuando venia para acá – explicó Elsa – Me torcí el tobillo y él me trajo en su bicicleta. - ¡No sigas con tus estupideces! – exclamó enfurecido el Sr Burgemeister - ¡No te quiero ver cerca de él! ¡Solo ha traído problemas! - Pues gracias a él sigo viva – confrontó Elsa, y se refería a lo ocurrido El Día de los Holandeses - ¿O ya se te olvidó? - ¡Vete a tu cuarto! – dijo su tío dando por zanjado el asunto - ¡Estas castigada! Elsa no le contestó y fue hasta su pieza y cerró de un portazo. Víctor no escuchó esta conversación, pero si escuchó los bruscos gritos del Sr Burgemeister y además escuchó el portazo que Elsa había dado. Se sintió muy mal por ella. Elsa no se merecía una vida así. Mientras pensaba eso, sintió el escozor de una lágrima en el ojo derecho. De inmediato se la quitó. Sparky se dio cuenta del estado anímico de Víctor y se acomodó en su regazo como un intento por consolarlo. Víctor lo abrazó y lloró en silencio. - ¿Qué me pasa Sparky? – le preguntaba Víctor a su perro - ¿Qué puedo hacer por ella?[Chapter 6] 6- Contando la verdad En la mente de Víctor, los pensamientos se aglomeraban sin sentido y no lograba distinguirlos unos de otros. Solo la idea de hablar con sus padres y contarles sobre esa extraña sensación que lo embargaba cada vez que estaba con Elsa o cuando ella se sentía dolida. Era la única idea lo bastante firme y clara como para llevarla a cabo. Y esa misma noche, la idea fue ejecutada. La madre de Víctor fue a buscarlo a su cuarto para que fuera a cenar y lo encontró recostado sobre su cama con una expresión de desgarro en su rostro. - ¿No irás a comer?- preguntó su madre - No tengo hambre- contestó Víctor. - ¿Pasa algo malo Víctor?- preguntó su mamá - No sé si soy yo o es Elsa- dijo Víctor, claramente no había pensado mucho en lo que había dicho. - ¿Ocurre algo con ella o contigo?- preguntó la Sra Frankenstein - Con ambos- respondió Víctor - Explícame por favor- le pidió su madre Víctor se decidió y le contó todo, cada detalle de lo que había pasado, desde su breve y conmovedor dialogo en el jardín, hasta el momento en que ella lo abrazó. -… luego desde su casa se oyeron gritos, no entendí ninguno, pero eran del Sr Burguemeister – concluyó Víctor – Eso es lo que ha pasado. - Cariño – dijo su mamá – no tiene nada de malo lo que has hecho por ella. Es difícil encontrar gente así de buena el día de hoy. Pero no logro comprender que es lo que te inquieta de todo esto. - Es que no sé que me pasa cuando estoy con ella – le explicó Víctor – Antes de todo esto no ocurría nada. Pero después del incidente en el molino, las cosas han cambiado. Cuando ella está triste, yo siento su pena como si fuera mía y siento ganas de hacer lo que sea por calmarla. Quiero que este bien y que no sufra. Cuando la oigo discutir con su tío o cuando algún compañero la molesta y la hace sentir mal, me dan ganas de defenderla. Y cuando la oí pelear con su tío, lloré unos minutos por lo que le pasó. No es lástima, es algo más grande y más fuerte, pero no sé que es. - Víctor… - dijo su madre, hizo una breve pausa y realizó directamente su pregunta - ¿No crees que hay una posibilidad de que ella te gusta? - ¿Qué me guste? – dijo Víctor asombrado - ¿Crees que me gusta? - Eso solo lo sabes tú – le contestó su progenitora – pero eso no tiene nada de malo. - Pero si su tío sospecha algo no tendrá piedad – murmuró Víctor, sus ojos comenzaron a llover despacio – No quiero que la lastime. No quiero. Su madre lo abrazó para consolarlo. - Si algo le pasa, será mi culpa – se lamentó Víctor - No, no será tu culpa – le corrigió su mamá – Tu solo quieres ayudarla, no te sientas responsable de si algo inoportuno le ocurre. No será por causa tuya. - Me gustaría poder hacer algo para que se sintiera mejor – dijo Víctor - Si ella dijo que se sentía más tranquila y menos sola si tú la ayudabas, entonces hazlo – le explicó su mamá – Con tan solo ayudarla cuando lo necesite, harás más de lo que crees. Como consejo te digo que no la dejes sola. Ella necesita amor y apoyo y tal vez encontró eso en ti. - Dudo que sienta lo mismo que yo – contestó Víctor – pero aún así la apoyaré en todo lo que necesite. Gracias por escucharme mamá. Ahora estoy mejor. - No dudes en contarme lo que quieras y si te sientes confundido – dijo su madre – y creo que tu papá también debería saberlo. - Lo sé – dijo su hijo - ¿crees que lo entienda? - Podrá ser un buen apoyo para ti – afirmó la Sra Frankenstein – Ven a cenar y hablaremos los tres. - Si – dijo Víctor. Luego ambos se dirigieron al comedor donde el Sr Frankenstein los esperaba. - ¿Por qué tardaste tanto, Víctor? – preguntó el padre amablemente a Víctor. - Te lo explicaré – contestó Víctor. Durante toda la cena, el padre de Víctor escuchó con atención y cuidado a su hijo y entendió sin problemas lo que le ocurría. No se molestó, aunque si se dio cuenta de que clase de emociones ahora lidiaban con su hijo. - Tu madre tiene razón – dijo su padre – mantén tu relación de siempre con ella hasta el momento, pero ahora apóyala un poco más. Así no se sentirá sola. -Me asusta que no sienta lo mismo que yo – dijo Víctor – ella me gusta. - Eso solo el tiempo lo dirá – aconsejó su padre – pero que eso no te altere. En algún momento sabrás lo que siente ella por ti. Estos consejos tanto de su madre como de su padre, calmaron profundamente la mente de Víctor. Ahora sabia lo que debía hacer y como no defraudar a Elsa. Esa noche, Víctor pudo estar más tranquilo que la vez anterior. Antes de dormir, habló con su perro. - Ya sé que hacer Sparky – dijo Víctor – y no voy a fallar. Puede decirse que esa noche, Víctor durmió muy bien.[Chapter 7] 7- ¿Y qué pasa con Elsa? En la casa vecina a la de Víctor, recostada en su cama y frustrada por lo que le había ocurrido al llegar, Elsa intentaba dormir. Pero todo lo ocurrido ese día solo le impidió poder cerrar los ojos. No hay que olvidar que ella no tenía la misma suerte de Víctor de hablar con un padre y una madre que la escucharan y aconsejaran. Sus padres casi nunca estaban en casa, debido a sus trabajos y esa ausencia tejía una profunda herida en el corazón de Elsa. Ella ya había aceptado, bastante resignada que no podía contar con el apoyo de alguien. Ese era otro motivo por el cual se sentía tan dichosa cuando Víctor le ofrecía ayuda. No estaba segura de que era lo que sentía por él, pero lo iba a descifrar. Pero también quería descubrir que sentía él por ella. No debían faltar motivos para que él la ayudara o intentara proteger, ella esperaba que no fuera por lastima, porque eso la decepcionaría. A pesar de lo concentrada que estaba en sus pensamientos, sus ojos se fueron cerrando y se durmió. Al abrir los ojos, se vio en las calles de Nueva Holanda totalmente vacias. Ni un alma viviente a la vista. Comenzó a desplazarse lentamente por las calles, cuando un grito desesperado alteró su calma. - ¡Elsa! – escuchaba decir. Comenzó a seguir la voz, que la condujo hacia la colina más alta de Nueva Holanda; en ella encontró el molino, el mismo que se había incendiado. - ¿Pero qué…? – Elsa dejó la pregunta a la mitad, debido a la sorpresa. ¿Qué hacia allí el molino si ese voraz incendio lo había destruido? - ¡Auxilio! – escuchó Elsa. La voz venia desde adentro del molino. Una fuerte curiosidad y temor la empujo a entrar ahí. - ¡Ayúdenme por favor, ayúdenme! – la voz le comenzaba a parecer familiar cuando ya había entrado al molino. Levantó la cabeza, miró hacia arriba y lo que observó le hizo dar un grito de horror: Víctor estaba colgando peligrosamente de una cuerda y un gato vampiro lo estaba rodeando, con la clara intención de hacerlo caer. Era el mismo gato que los había atacado el día del incidente. - ¡Víctor! – gritó Elsa - ¡Espera, no te sueltes! Dicho esto, comenzó a correr escalera arriba. La situación era extraña, pues estaba ocurriendo casi lo mismo que le ocurrió a ella el Día de los Holandeses, pero esta vez era Víctor quien estaba en peligro. Cuando llegó a la zona más cercana donde podía ayudar a Víctor, dejó de subir y se detuvo. - ¡Elsa! – dijo Víctor - ¡Ayúdame! - ¡Sostente, no te vayas a caer! – gritó Elsa, luego estiró su brazo intentando alcanzar la cuerda sin caer escalera abajo. Para su mala suerte, el gato vampiro advirtió su presencia y se arrojó encima de ella. - ¡Quítate! – exclamó Elsa - ¡Vete! Súbitamente, sintiéndose embargada por una fuerza que no parecía suya, logró coger al gato y lanzarlo lejos de ella, lo cual le facilito intentar ayudar otra vez a Víctor. Peligrosamente se inclinó hacia él, arriesgándose a una caída de gran altura. - ¡Dame la mano Víctor! – le dijo Elsa - ¡Confía en mi! Víctor se balanceo levemente hacia Elsa y estirando la mano para alcanzar la de la niña. En cosa de segundos, Víctor le cogió la mano a Elsa, ella se sujetó a la baranda de la escalera y sostuvo fuertemente a Víctor e intentó alzarlo. Pero de pronto, desde la entrada del molino, la cual se veía muy pequeña desde donde estaban ambos niños, comenzó a arder sin explicación. El fuego trepó la madera como una vicuña trepa montañas. Ambos chicos se asustaron mucho. - Elsa, intenta correr, pero sueltame – le dijo Víctor a Elsa. - ¡No! ¡No te voy a dejar solo! – gritó Elsa - ¡No dejaré que mueras! Cuando dijo eso, sintió sobre ella la misma fuerza que tuvo cuando empujó al gato vampiro cuando este la atacó y esta vez la usó para subir a Víctor y evitar que cayera. Una vez que él estaba en las escaleras y no colgando hacia abajo, se arrodilló y comenzó a llorar despacio. - No temas – dijo Elsa arrodillándose e intentando mirarlo a los ojos – No dejaré que estés en peligro. Estoy contigo. Víctor la miró a los ojos de una forma profunda, como si no tuviera voz y con la mirada intentara decirle todo. Ese contacto visual se quebró cuando ambos sintieron un revoloteo bastante conocido. El gato había vuelto. Pero lo peor era que el incendio iba creciendo y ya casi los alcanzaba. Huyendo ambos del peligro, siguieron subiendo las escaleras hasta hallar una ventana, que daba al techo del molino, pero hacia fuera. Salieron por ahí, y vieron que no había salida. Lo peor, el gato vampiro los alcanzó y atrapó y sin piedad alguna, se arrojó sobre Víctor. Elsa intentó detener al monstruo, pero este la arañó bruscamente y la arrojó contra la ventana. Ella volvió a pararse y antes que pudiera hacer algo, vio como la estructura del techo del molino iba cediendo ante el peso de Víctor y el gato sobre él. En segundos, Víctor cayó junto con el gato al interior del molino en llamas. - ¡Víctor, no! – gritó Elsa, atrapada por un profundo miedo y dolor. A pesar de estar en el techo del molino, logró volver a la ventana por donde antes había salido y volvió a ingresar adentro del molino. Pero unos segundos después la estructura de madera del tejado no aguantó más y comenzó a caer. Elsa vio su fin llegar. La estructura le caería encima. - ¡No, por favor! – gritó asustada y abrió los ojos de golpe. Vio a su alrededor. Estaba en su cuarto. Respiraba agitada y sus brazos le temblaban. La pesadilla fue horrible. Cubrió su boca con sus manos y trató de calmarse. Le tomó 10 minutos hacerlo. Después miró por la ventana. El cielo aún estaba oscuro. Buscó a ciegas el velador al lado izquierdo de su cama. Cuando sintió que lo tocaba, buscó sobre la superficie, una linterna. Al encontrarla, la encendió y apuntó hacia la pared junto a la puerta de su cuarto, pues allí había un reloj. Eran las dos de la mañana. Apagó la linterna y la dejó sobre el velador. Se recostó sobre la almohada, aunque no pensaba en dormir, sino en algo más profundo. Era en relación con su sueño ¿Qué quiso decir ese horrible sueño? Elsa se lo preguntaba, porque cuando tenía 8 años, su madre le había dicho que los sueños tenían relación directa con los sentimientos del corazón. Si eso era cierto ¿Qué sentimientos ahora estaban naciendo en su corazón? Solo pudo darse cuenta de que la alegría porque Víctor la ayudaba tenía más motivos, además del hecho de haber estado tan sola los últimos años. Era comprensible que no lo pudiera descifrar tan rápido, solo tenía 10 años. Optó por reservar estos pensamientos solo para ella y tratar de que le estorbara lo menos posible. Ahora había algo de Víctor que para ella tenia un valor importante y lucharía por descubrirlo y saber que sentía con respecto a eso. Si Elsa hubiese tenido alguna compañía madura como un padre o una madre a su lado, ya se habría dado cuenta de que se estaba enamorando, pero no era tan fácil saberlo cuando se está tan sola como ella.[Chapter 8] 8- Nuevo día, un nuevo indicio Pasaron dos días y no ocurrió nada especial. Ambos niños continuaron con su rutina normal, aunque ahora se saludaban tranquilamente al entrar a clases o al salir. Esto podía verse normal, pero había un par de ojos que no lo veía así. Que veía eso como algo poco frecuente e inusual, pues Víctor normalmente no le dirigía la palabra a nadie en clases, aunque en los últimos días, tras lo ocurrido el \"Día de los holandeses\" los compañeros de Víctor le hablaban un poco más, con excepción de esos ojos que pertenecían a Toshiaki, quien despreciaba totalmente a Víctor. No solo por el hecho de que Víctor fuera un buen estudiante y que sus calificaciones casi siempre superaban las de él, sino también porque había quedado en vergüenza frente a Víctor, cuando este lo salvó de la tortuga gigante. Para Toshiaki no valía nada el hecho de que Víctor lo hubiera salvado de una muerte segura, por eso siempre buscaba alguna manera de poder humillarlo. Y sin que Víctor lo notara, su rival había encontrado la manera de hacerlo. Lo que Toshiaki no sabia, era que Víctor era una buena persona, pero no estaba dispuesto a dejar que lo humillaran. Ni a él ni a quienes el quería o le importaran. Los días siguieron avanzando y para Elsa estos iban muriendo, al igual que las hojas en otoño. A pesar de que ella y Víctor estaban recién descubriendo sus nuevos sentimientos, parecían callarlos cuando se hablaban. Eran palabras como \"Hola\" y \"Adiós\" y como máximo de palabras \"¿Estás bien?\", pero esconder esas emociones solo los dañaba aún más. Pero cuando llegó un día viernes, ambos recibieron un fuerte flechazo que los hizo fortalecer lo que sentían y reforzó su confianza en querer confesarlo. Cuando inició la clase de Lenguaje (si, sé que se repite, pero es que tengo la teoría de que a Elsa le gusta esta clase, porque aquí se expresa más, por eso la uso tanto) y antes de que terminara la jornada, la profesora preguntó a los niños que cosa o persona seria su inspiración para escribir un poema. - Yo escogería… a mi difunto gatito – dijo Chica Rara – Él era todo para mi. Dicho esto, soltó un par de lágrimas que los demás ignoraron. - Yo escogería la muerte – dijo Nassor, no causó sorpresa alguna, su personalidad era así de oscura – Porque allí es donde todos acabamos. - De acuerdo – dijo la maestra - ¿Y tu Elsa? ¿Qué escogerías? - Pues elegiría a alguien – dijo nerviosa – Pero no diré quien es. - Claro, porque eres lo bastante débil como para cerrar tu boca y llevártelo a la tumba – se burló Toshiaki. Elsa bajó la cabeza lentamente mientras la rabia y pena inundaban su ser. Su estado fue la gota que desbordó el vaso para Víctor. Esta vez no se quedaría callado. - ¿Qué no sabes hacer algo más que humillar y reírte de los demás? – encaró Víctor a Toshiaki mientras se levantaba de su puesto. - ¿Y tu que te metes? – gritó su rival - ¿O es que te preocupa tu novia? Víctor sintió un estallido de rabia en su corazón. Toshiaki ya había llegado muy lejos. No sabia como Toshiaki había descubierto lo que sentía por Elsa, pero no toleraría una humillación así. - ¿Crees que voy a tolerar tus bromas o a permitir que la dañes a ella? – dijo Víctor señalando a Elsa. - ¡Niños, no sigan! ¡Toshiaki, ve donde el director, estás castigado! – dijo la profesora intentando acabar con la discusión. - ¿Y a esta mosca muerta no la manda también? – reclamó Toshiaki señalando a Víctor. - ¡Obedezca! – dijo enfadada la maestra. Toshiaki frunció el ceño, se levantó de su pupitre y salió de la sala en dirección a la oficina del director. - Niños, no quiero más de estos maltratos hacia otros – reprendió la maestra – Si alguno más lo hace, terminará igual que su compañero. - ¿Y por qué no envió a Víctor a que lo castigaran? – preguntó Edgar, claramente con mala intención. - Porque él no agredió a su compañero – explicó la profesora – lo que hizo fue exigirle que respetara a su compañera. Una vez dicho esto, la clase volvió a lo suyo y trataron de ignorar lo ocurrido. Unos 20 minutos después, sonó un timbre y los niños cogieron sus pertenencias y salieron de la sala. Las clases habían terminado por ese día. Elsa salió cabizbaja del colegio. Se sentía mal, no solo por la humillación que había sufrido, sino por Víctor, que por defenderla también había sido humillado. Y tanto ella como Víctor ignoraban lo que sentían el uno por el otro. Solo sabían que por culpa de Toshiaki, ahora sus compañeros los molestarían. Solo podían esperar que no fuese demasiado. Por otra parte, Toshiaki solo consiguió aumentar su odio hacia Víctor. Sabía ahora como humillarlo. No le importaba si eso le costaba la expulsión de la escuela, quería ver a su rival en el suelo. En realidad el odio que Toshiaki le tenía a Víctor era debido a que Toshiaki había recibido la errónea lección de que si no lograba ser el primero en todo, entonces no servía de nada. Y con alguien con la capacidad intelectual tan alta como la tenia Víctor, Toshiaki pensaba que la única manera de poder superarlo, era quitándolo de su camino. No podía hacerlo a través de la ciencia o el colegio, pues Víctor casi siempre sobresalía en ello. Entonces lo haría a través de sus debilidades. Pero solo conocía su supuesta debilidad por Elsa. En fin, ese día, Elsa se disponía a irse a su casa, pero prefirió esperar a Víctor para irse con él. Cuando lo vio salir del colegio, corrió a su encuentro. - Perdón – dijo Elsa al llegar donde él. - ¿Por qué te disculpas? – preguntó Víctor. - Por mi culpa te avergonzaron frente a todos – explicó la niña. - Pero no fue tu culpa – aclaró Víctor – La culpa es de Toshiaki. No sé por qué, pero quería humillarte. - No debiste molestarte – sonrió levemente Elsa. - Te prometí que no dejaría que te hicieran daño – dijo Víctor – No me gusta verte llorar. - ¿Por qué te preocupas tanto por mi? – le preguntó Elsa directamente. Víctor sintió un cosquilleo en su interior. No sabía que contestarle. - Bueno, Elsa… yo – balbuceó Víctor, pero su frase fue interrumpida por el mismo ser desagradable que los había molestado antes. - ¡Apártate de mi camino! – le gritó Toshiaki a Víctor, empujándolo al mismo tiempo. -¿Cuál es tu problema conmigo? – le dijo Víctor a Toshiaki en tono desafiante. - ¿Quieres saberlo? – amenazó Toshiaki – Pues aquí tienes tu respuesta ¡Eres una tonta basura! Esas crueles palabras fueron como un puñal que atravesó el corazón de Víctor. No dijo nada, pero estaba a punto de llorar. De manera sorpresiva, Elsa asomó su valentía y se dispuso a defender a su amigo. - Eso serás tú, pero ¿Qué es Víctor? – dijo Elsa con mucho veneno. - ¡Tu no te metas Elsa! – protestó Toshiaki. - Responde, si eres tan valiente – encaró Elsa hablando un poco más fuerte de lo habitual. - Como quieras, dije que él es una tonta basura – repitió Toshiaki. - Y Víctor es tu espejo – dijo Elsa señalando a Víctor. Jaque Mate. Víctor se quedó pasmado ante lo dicho por Elsa. Se tuvo que llevar las manos a la boca para evitar lanzar un grito de exclamación por lo dicho por Elsa y a la vez no reírse por como Toshiaki había terminado en vergüenza. - ¡Esto no ha terminado Víctor! – lo amenazó Toshiaki - ¡Tú y Elsa van a pagar por esto! Se sentía humillado, pero intentó disimularlo. Dio media vuelta y se fue. Pasaron unos minutos y todo era silencio. Ni Víctor ni Elsa hablaron. Después, Víctor fue hasta su bicicleta en completo silencio. Solo se oía el ruido de sus pasos. - ¡Víctor! – dijo Elsa rompiendo el silencio. Víctor solo la miró. Elsa también lo hizo. Pudo ver en sus ojos una tristeza que aun no salía de él. - Estoy bien. Gracias – dijo Víctor con un nudo en la garganta. Elsa le puso una mano en el hombro derecho y lo miró a los ojos. - No es verdad – respondió ella. Víctor no pudo seguir ocultándolo. En silencio la miró y unas pocas lágrimas rodaron por su cara. Elsa lo abrazó. Víctor la abrazó también y siguió llorando en silencio, como solía hacerlo. Solo fueron un par de minutos y luego Víctor dejó de llorar. - ¿Te duele que traten así, verdad? – preguntó Elsa. - No solo me duele que me insulte – explicó Víctor – me duele que disfrute haciéndolo y que quiera que todos lo vean como lo hace. Se que Toshiaki me odia, pero es triste que lo demuestre a cada instante. Yo nunca haría algo así. - Hay gente que lastima por placer – corroboró Elsa – pero no le hagas caso. - No es porque lo haga solo conmigo – agregó Víctor – También me hiere que lo haga contigo. - ¿Por qué Víctor? – preguntó Elsa. Víctor la miró a los ojos. Comprendió que debía decirle la verdad. - Elsa, lo que pasa es que… - hizo una pausa breve – Tu a mi me importas mucho. Más que nadie. Más que como compañera. - ¿Qué quieres decir? – preguntó Elsa confundida. Víctor agachó la cabeza y no contestó. Ella comenzó a creer lo peor. - ¿Lo haces por qué sientes lastima por mi? – preguntó ella pensando negativamente. - ¡No, no, no es por eso! – aclaró Víctor – Es algo más bonito y menos superficial. No sé como decírtelo. En parte es empatía, pero es por algo más. Solo sé que cuando tu lloras o sufres, siento lo mismo que tú. Como si para mi fuera necesario verte tranquila y feliz. Ella lo miró unos segundos en silencio. Todo lo que Víctor le había dicho era exactamente lo que ella sentía cuando lo veía o estaba con él. Así se sentía cuando él estaba triste y también el corazón le decía que no debía dejarlo solo si estaba así. Eso fue lo que la había llevado a defenderlo de Toshiaki. - Víctor… - dijo Elsa - … yo siento lo mismo. Ambos se miraron a los ojos. De manera indirecta se habían dicho que se gustaban, pero ambos querían decirlo con las palabras correctas. Decir: \"Me gustas\". Hubo un breve silencio. - Creo que es mejor irnos a casa – interrumpió Elsa – Ya sabes como es mi tío. - ¿Quieres que te lleve? – dijo Víctor de pronto. - Pues… está bien – dijo Elsa luego de un segundo de duda. De la misma forma que el día en que Elsa se había torcido el tobillo, ambos se fueron juntos en la bicicleta de Víctor. Llegaron esta vez un poco más rápido, porque esta vez nadie estaba lesionado. - Gracias por traerme – dijo Elsa. - Fue un gusto hacerlo – respondió Víctor. Antes de bajarse de la bicicleta y correr a su casa, Elsa le dio un beso en la mejilla a Víctor. Él se sintió nervioso. - Eso fue por ser el único que me entiende – respondió Elsa, explicando el por qué de su reacción. Luego bajó de la bicicleta, dio media vuelta y se fue a su casa. Víctor la miró hasta que ella desapareció tras la puerta de su hogar, luego avanzó hasta el jardín de su casa, dejó la bicicleta junto a la pared, entró al patio y saludó a su perro. - Hola Sparky – dijo Víctor alegremente. Sparky saltó feliz por verlo y ladró de manera alegre. Víctor comenzó a murmurar lo que Elsa le había dicho. - … por ser el único que me entiende – murmuraba Víctor, luego agregó con voz apagada – que te entiende y que le gustas. Lo dijo lo bastante alto como para que su corazón lo escuchara, pero no lo suficiente para que Elsa lo oyera. Tener 10 años y estar enamorado de una niña tierna y a la vez solitaria no era cosa fácil para Víctor. Y al otro lado de la cerca, en su habitación y pensando sobre lo ocurrido, Elsa ya había descubierto lo que le ocurría, pero ahora le asustaba decírselo directamente a Víctor. (El próximo capitulo será el ultimo, lo publicaré lo antes posible!)[Chapter 9] 9- ¡No voy a seguir esperando! La tarde pasó rápidamente y el sol desapareció dando paso a la oscuridad. Esa noche, Víctor prefirió salir al jardín y jugar con su perro para distraerse un rato. Abrió la puerta que daba al patio trasero y llamó a su amigo - ¡Corre Sparky, al patio! – dijo Víctor muy entusiasta. Sparky obedeció encantado, amaba jugar en el jardín por la noche. No tardó en llegar a la puerta y salir. Víctor lo siguió, cogió la pelota favorita de su perro y se la arrojó para que la trajera de vuelta y así iniciar un divertido juego. Durante el juego, escuchó pasos al otro lado de la cerca y supo de inmediato que Elsa también había salido al jardín de su respectiva casa. - Debe ser Elsa – se dijo Víctor. Pronto se dio cuenta que era verdad, porque Sparky comenzó a ladrar feliz, porque vio a Persephone al otro lado de la pared de madera blanca que los separaba. Víctor no esperó mucho y se dirigió a la cerca de manera lenta - Elsa ¿estás ahí? – preguntó. Unos segundos después, Elsa le respondió. - ¿Víctor? – preguntó. - Hola Elsa ¿Qué haces afuera? – preguntó Víctor. - Salí a jugar con Persephone – contestó Elsa. - Qué buena idea – afirmó Víctor. - ¿Qué haces tú? – preguntó Elsa. - Jugando con Sparky – contestó él. - Me gustaría ver… hablar contigo sin tener esta cerca entre los dos – dijo Elsa casi en un susurro. Claramente había querido decir \"verte\", pero los nervios la traicionaron. - Pues ven acá – contestó Víctor. Dicho esto, corrió a la puerta de entrada al jardín y la abrió. Espero un minuto y vio llegar a Elsa. - Hola Víctor – saludo ella. - Hola – contestó él. - Persephone vino conmigo – dijo Elsa - ¿No te molesta? - No – respondió Víctor – así Sparky tendrá con quien jugar. Ambos rieron. Después, Elsa entró al jardín junto con su mascota, la cual ladró feliz al ver a Sparky. Ambos canes fueron a jugar cerca de unos arbustos, dejando solos a sus dueños. - Me gusta más estar aquí que en mi casa – comentó Elsa. - ¿Por qué? – preguntó Víctor. - No es agradable vivir cerca de un tirano que no te deja opinar – explicó Elsa poniéndose triste. - Me da mucha tristeza eso – dijo Víctor en forma empática – Desearía que fueras feliz. Ambos se sentaron en el césped apoyados contra la cerca. - Soy feliz cuando tú… - Elsa cayó bruscamente sus palabras. - ¿Cuándo yo qué? – insistió Víctor. - Cuando tú estas conmigo – Elsa se cubrió la cara y empezó a llorar - ¡No debí decirlo! - ¿Decir que cosa? – se extrañó Víctor. - No debí decir lo que me pasaba contigo – dijo ella y siguió llorando – Porque sé que no me volverás a hablar, que me encontrarás patética y que se yo. - No te entiendo – dijo él. - ¡Víctor, tu me gustas! – soltó Elsa de golpe – Me has gustado siempre y después de lo que pasó el \"Día de los holandeses\", me terminaste gustando más. No me atrevía a decírtelo a la cara – dijo y calló por unos segundos. - No debí decirlo – murmuró la niña – Mejor me voy. - ¡Elsa, no te vayas! – exclamó Víctor sosteniéndole la mano. Lo que Elsa le acababa de confesar, lo había hecho sentirse interiormente más feliz que nunca. Casi tanto como cuando Sparky volvió a la vida. - ¿Por qué? – preguntó Elsa – Debo parecer una tonta. - No Elsa, no es así – corrigió Víctor – No es una tontería que me lo dijeras. Es más, me alegro de que sientas eso. - Víctor… - dijo Elsa. - Elsa, tu también me gustas – confesó Víctor – Me gustas hace mucho. Eres la persona más tierna que conozco y estoy feliz de que sientas lo mismo. Ambos se miraron a los ojos, no se habían soltado las manos. El tiempo parecía haberse detenido. Luego de unos minutos, las palabras regresaron. - Pero, no creo que podamos ser… ¿pareja? – comentó Víctor. A su corta edad, era normal que algunas cosas le costara encontrarles un nombre. - ¿Es por mi tío? – preguntó Elsa. - Además de eso, hay otra cosa – dijo Víctor – Solo tenemos 10 años. Somos niños. Creo que deberíamos esperar a crecer un poco. Hubo un silencio. - Puede que tengas razón – dijo Elsa – Pero quiero que hagamos una promesa. - ¿Cuál? – preguntó Víctor. - Qué sin importar el día, el año y el tiempo que pase, vamos a estar juntos algún día – Elsa habló con una voz muy suave. - Pues, te lo prometo – dijo Víctor y le tomó la mano. - Así será – respondió Elsa, tomándole la otra mano y sonrojándose levemente. - Y también prometo que seré tu amigo más cercano y el mejor de todos – aseguró Víctor – siempre y cuando tú lo aceptes y también seas mi amiga. - Lo voy a ser – prometió Elsa. Víctor cortó una flor y se la entregó a Elsa. - ¿Amigos de verdad? – dijo levantando la flor. - Amigos de verdad – dijo Elsa, recibiendo la flor. Ambos se abrazaron, invadidos por una felicidad enorme. Pero el momento fue interrumpido por un fuerte relámpago. - ¡Oh no! ¡Parece que lloverá! – exclamó Elsa. - Si – dijo Víctor – mejor nos vamos a casa. - Es mejor – dijo Elsa - ¡Persephone, ven pequeña! Persephone, que se había asustado tanto como Sparky por el relámpago, corrió a los brazos de su dueña. - Fue bonito estar contigo – le dijo Elsa a Víctor. - Lo mismo digo yo – contestó Víctor. Luego le dio un beso en la mejilla a Elsa. Ella se ruborizó. A los pocos segundos, otro fuerte relámpago apareció. - Mejor ve a casa – aconsejó Víctor a Elsa. - Si – respondió ella – Tal vez mi tío salga a pedirme que entre y no quiero problemas. Se despidieron amablemente y luego Elsa corrió a su casa. A su vez, Víctor cogió a Sparky y entró en su casa también. - ¿Qué hacías afuera cariño? – le preguntó su madre a Víctor – Te vi con Elsa. - Estábamos hablando – contestó Víctor. - ¿Todo está bien? – su madre habló implícitamente. - Si, ahora somos amigos – respondió Víctor – Pero en un tiempo más, quien sabe. Dicho esto, dejó a Sparky en el suelo, el cuál corrió al cuarto de Víctor para esconderse. - Me alegro por ustedes – dijo la Sra Frankenstein – Hijo, podrás ser un niño, pero cada día me asombra tu comprensión, inteligencia, madurez y sobre todo tu buen corazón. Víctor abrazó a su mamá. Estaba feliz y quería demostrarlo. - Voy a mi cuarto – dijo Víctor – veré como está Sparky. - De acuerdo Víctor – respondió su madre – después ven a cenar. Tu papá llegará en unos minutos. Víctor afirmó con la cabeza y fue a su cuarto. Se sentó en el suelo y llamó a Sparky, Este estaba más tranquilo y salió feliz de debajo de la cama de su dueño. Víctor se levantó y se sentó en su cama con Sparky a su lado. - Gracias por compartir mi alegría Sparky – le dijo Víctor a su perro – Y sé que cuando sea el momento, estaré con Elsa. Sparky ladró feliz, diciendo que lo apoyaba y quería con todo el corazón. FIN. (Este es mi primer fanfic largo. Gracias por sus comentarios.

Scott is still trying to become evil. Dr. Evil and Austin are still brothers and everything is the same. Ya-da-ya-da-ya-da, you get the idea, just read the damn thing. Austin is back at his pad sitting in a bean bag chair watching a 'tittie movie'. He's quite into it, but suddenly the phone rings. Austin:(jumps a little then realizes it's the phone and picks it up)\"Hello?\" Austin's Dad: \"What's that noise in the back? Is Tanya over again?\" Austin: \"Oh damn!\" (turns down the volume of the T.V.) \"No, Dad, just a movie.\" Austin's Dad: \"Oh, that's a shame. Anyways, I'm just calling to see how you're taking everything.\" Austin: \"I'm fine, Dad, really.\" (starts watching the movie instead of listening) Austin's Dad: (begins rambling while Austin is glued to the screen) \"It's just that I feel like such a failure for not spending more time with you. I know if your mother would was here, she'dnever have done this to you. She was so nice, she'd go over every day to that orphanage down the street to play with the children there. She'd play games with you for hours. I didn't even play with you a bit.\" Austin: (paying no attention but pretending to listen) \"Play with her tit. Yeah.\" Austin's Dad: \"What?\" Austin: (realizes what he just said) \"No, No, I mean play with her clit. NO! I mean! Uh...Dad, I have to go. I'm quite busy. Bye.\" (hangs up the phone and gets back into the movie) Austin: (the phone rings again) \"Hello?\" Austin's Dad: \"Ok, son, look, I know I haven't been the best father to you, but could I take you to lunch tomorrow? It's a small step but I want to start.\" Austin: \"That's very groovy, but, I really have to go.\" (keeps looking at the movie) Austin's Dad: \"It's just your mother was so kind and-\" (Austin hangs up) Austin: (phone rings again) \"GOOD GOD!\" (picks it up) \"Look, I'm trying to watch a porno right now and I can't pay attention to my meat and two bits with you on the phone! You can try and be my daddy tomorrow!\" Basil: \"Um...\" Austin: \"Oh, sorry, Basil. Thought you were my Dad. I don't want you to be my daddy.\" Basil: \"Yes, I understand, Austin.\" Austin: \"Not that I wouldn't mind you as a father.\" Basil: \"Shut up, Austin.\" Austin: \"Okay.\" Basil: \"Now, I have something important to show you. Go get your laptop.\" Austin: (Austin pulls out a laptop from the side of his bean bag) \"Got it.\" Basil: \"I'm sending you the file now. It's the security video of the 10 Diamonds Casino. It seems last night it was broken into and had all of it's money stolen.\" Austin: \"Oh, that's awful.\" Basil: \"That's not the worst part, watch the file.\" Austin: (Austin clicks a few buttons and a video starts playing) VIDEO : A open vault is in the background of the video and people can be seen taking gold bricks out in carts. Dr. Evil appears on-screen with Mr.Bigglesworth. Dr. Evil: Hello casino owners, Austin Powers, weird russian hacker kid who got ahold of this casino's secruity footage. I'm here to let you all know that Dr. Evil is back in business. (puts pinkie up to mouth) (Frau appears on screen and shoots at the camera) Dr. Evil: Did you get it? Frau: No, hold on. (reloads gun) Dr. Evil: Oh! I'm still on! (looks evil again) Frau: (shoots at camera again but misses) Shit! Dr. Evil: Again? You can't even hit a fricken camera? Frau: It's quite high up, herr doktor! (reloads gun) Dr. Evil: You better frickin hit it this time. Frau: (starts shootin again but keeps missing) MOTHERFU-(finally hits camera) Austin: \"No, this can't be!\" Basil: \"I'm afraid it's true, Austin\" Austin: \"He said he was going straight, not doing any more 'evil' business. He was even changing his name to Dr. Not-So-Evil.\" Basil: \"I guess some people never change.\"[Chapter 3] Outside shot of a Starbucks. The inside of the Starbucks is now in view showing a...Starbucks. Frau is at the register, Scott is moping floors and Number 2 is making the orders. The place is very crowded and there is a line at the register. Frau: \"NEXT!\" Man: \"I want a double mocha 'express'-o latte, add caramel, hold the mocha.\" Frau: \"DOUBLE MOCHA 'EXPRESS'-O LATTE, ADD CARAMEL, HOLD THE MOCHA!\" Number 2: (turns around) \"Frau, I'm right here. I heard him say it and for the love of god, stop screaming!\" (makes the drink and puts it on the counter) Man: (picks up drink and looks at it) \"No, I said without mocha.\" Frau: \"This is without mocha.\" Man: \"No it isn't.\" Frau: \"Oh, it isn't?\" (pulls out a gun and shoots him) \"NEXT!\" (the people in line don't care about the person who was shot and shove him out of the way to get their order) Dr. Evil: (Dr. Evil walks in from the back area and approaches Frau) \"Hey, Frau, I was just sitting back there and I had a thought.\" Frau: \"Oh?\" Dr. Evil: \"Scottie's been working so hard, maybe we should let him take a break so he doesn't need to ' use the janitor's closet anymore '?\" Frau: \"Oh, herr doktor, what a good idea! SCOTT!\" Scott: (Scott puts his mop down and walks over with a squirt bottle in hand) \"I'm not cleaning the bathrooms out again! The last time I was cleaning the womens some bitch as big a whale came in and lost about 200lb all over the walls!\" Frau: \"No, Scott, your father wants to give you a break.\" Scott: \"Oh, cool. Like now?\" Frau: \"Yes, now. Go.\" Scott: \"I'll be at the porno store downtown.\" (throws the squirt bottle and leaves) Dr. Evil: \"Number 2, can you take care of the customers? I belive Frau was just about to go on break.\" Number 2: (under his breath) \" I've been doing it all day, why not now?\" Dr. Evil: \"What was that?\" Number 2: \"Of course, Doctor Evil.\" Dr. Evil: \"Carry on.\" (Doctor Evil and Frau try to avoid being seen sneaking into the janitor's closet but make it painfully obvious where they're going) Number 2: (sighs and starts taking orders) Austin Powers, Basil and a group of men with machine guns burst into the Starbucks. Austin: \"All right, where's Doctor Evil?\" Number 2: (points with his hands in the air) \"I believe he's hiding in the janitor's closet.\" Austin: (Austin walks over to the janitor's closet and opens the door) \"BLIMEY!\" Dr. Evil: (from inside the closet) \"Oh, shit!\" Austin: \"Hey, how are you doing that, man?\" Dr. Evil: (still inside the closet)\"Well, I take pilates from time to time.\" Austin: \"Oh, right, right. You know I thought about trying it sometime.\" Dr. Evil: \"You should, the Full Lotus-Sun Goddess Back Clench is simply breathtaking.\" Austin: (stops) \"Wait a tick\". (gets offensive again) \"Why did you break into the 10 Diamonds Casino?\" Dr. Evil: (still inside the closet) \"10 Dildo What?\" Austin Powers: \"The casino you robbed, man!\" Dr. Evil: \"I didn't rob any frickin casino. If I did, do you think I'd be in the janitor's closet boning Frau?\" Frau: \"Hey!\" Austin Powers: \"That's Frau? I couldn't see herface, wait, is that an arm? OH MY GOD! Is that her leg! THAT'S NOT RIGHT, MAN!\" Dr. Evil: \"Don't hate the player, hate the game.\" Basil: \"Austin, do you think it might be better if we take them to headquarters for this?\" Austin: \"Right, right, out you go, you sick bastards are going downtown!\" Basil: \"Actually, our headquarters isn't downtown.\" Austin: \"Um, well. (angry again) You sick bastards are going uptown!\" Basil: \"Actually, it's across the street, Austin.\" Austin: \"You could have told me this first, Basil. All right, you sick bastards are going across the street!\"[Chapter 4] Dr. Evil, Frau and Number 2 sit in a small cell him by the door.The room is about eight feet wide and eight feet long making it rather crammed for everyone. Draped windows are on every side of the room. Austin: \"All right, now why did you rob the casino\" Dr. Evil: \"I told you, I didn't rob any casino.\" Frau: \"Yah, that's true.\" Austin: \"We have security footage from the casino showing you rob it!\" Two guards and Basil bring Scott into sit down with the others. The room is so packed, he has to climb over the table to his seat and has a VERY hard time getting in. Guard: \"Finding him wasn't easy, the only reason we got his location is because he was trying to make out of an adult video store with some unpurchased goods.\" (Scott gives the guard a bad look) Basil: \"We still have to find Mini me and bring him in. By the way, Austin, couldn't you let someone else interrogate a few of them? Or perhaps interrogate them one at a time?\" Austin: (stops and gets a wide-eyed look) \"They'd like that wouldn't they? Gives em' more time to plot their filthy little schemes while they're rubbing their dirty, grimy monkey paws together.\" (growls at them all and they all lean backwards with shocked looks) Dr. Evil: \"As for myself, I haven't rubbed my paws together for quite a long time, Mr. Powers.\" Austin: \"Show them the footage!\" (A guard goes out and comes to the door with a roller carrying a tv and a vcr. The room is obviously filled and the roller won't fit in) Guard: \"Sir, I don't think this will fit.\" Austin: \"Oh, comon, man!\" Scott: \"That's not going to fit.\" Austin: \"You be quiet, you criminal!\" Guard: (The guard tries a few things but only manages to get the roller a foot inside the door) \"Look, I really can't do this with you sitting here.\" Austin. \"All right, man, I'll scoot.\" (Austin moves his chair overto the wall which is only a few feet away) Guard: (The roller still won't fit in the door because of the angle of the door and the metal table inside the room) \"Uh, this won't fit in there.\" Austin: \"All right, put it back in the hall! Play it there.\" Guard: (The guard takes it out to the hall and plays the video outside the doorway) Frau: \"I can't see half the screen.\" Dr. Evil: \"I can't see any of it!\" Scott: \"I'll summarize for you, let's see, there's your ugly ass. There's some gold, a few people, there's Frau.\" Dr. Evil: \"What!\" (goes over Frau and leans into Number 2's lap) (Number 2 leans back and Frau tries to see over Dr. Evil) Frau: \"I CAN'T SEE! I can't see!\" Dr. Evil: \"I'll move up for you!\" (Dr. Evil moves over Frau putting his knees in Number 2's lap and his hands in Scott's) Scott: (Scott gets up but can't get out so he gets tightly pinned to the wall) \"Get off me!\" Frau: \"I want to see!\" (Frau goes over the top of Dr. Evil to see the tape) (Frau is making Dr. Evil lose his balance, making his head bob forwards and backwards) Dr. Evil: \"Sorry, daddy's trying to watch!\" (Dr. Evil turns his head towards Scott putting his head right in line with Scott's crotch) Outside, Basil is walking past and looks at the back window of the room. From outside it appears as if Dr. Evil is giving Scott a b.j. and Frau is on top of Dr. Evil, riding him. Sounds can be heard from inside the room. Frau: \"I WANT TO SEE! I CAN'T SEE IT!\" Scott: \"GET THE HELL OF ME, YOU CIRCUS FREAK!\" Dr.Evil: \"Scott, daddy has to do this!\" Number 2: \"Can't you all just sit down and let me describe what it looks like?\" Basil: (to himself) \"Oh my god, what's going on in there!\"[Chapter 5] I'm sorry I'm late with the next chapter, but I've been away for awhile. Here we go...I hope you like it! Austin, Basil, Dr. Evil and the rest of Dr. Evil's posse sit in a much more comfortable area of the British Intelligence Technology Chicago Headquarters or B.I.T.C.H for short. Members of B.I.T.C.H. are considered B.I.T.C.Hs. . They all sit in comfy and brightly colored chairs. The rest of the agency matches the chairs in appearance. Scott is playing a GameBoy and not really listening. Austin: \"So, you've been at your Starbucks for the past two months and you have documented evidence?\" Dr. Evil: (Dr. Evil and Frau exchange glances) \"Well, I have been caught in several...unwanted situations by members of our established chicago police force from time to time.\" Scott: (Doesn't look up from gameboy)\"He means he has 129 charges of public nudity.\" Dr. Evil: \"Scott, didn't you see daddy was talking?\" Scott: (Still focused on the gameboy) \"No, but I saw you in the men's restroom twenty minutes ago with Frau.\" Frau: (Frau titters) Dr. Evil: (Dr. Evil looks around, clearly angry) Number Two: \"Well, someone is obviously framing Dr. Evil.\" Dr. Evil: \"Isn't there something you B.I.T.C.Hs can do?\" Austin: \"I BEG YOUR PARDON?\" Basil:(whispering) \"New agency, Austin, new agency.\" Austin: \"OH! Right, right. Well, the Acting and Screen Section has been studying the tape, but those A.S.Ses haven't found anything.\" Basil: \"The Film Intense Cutting and Knowledgeable Erasing Regiment has been working day and night as well, but not a single F.U.C.K.E.R has found anything.\" Number Two: \"Perhaps, Dr. Evil might be allowed to try to find these criminals, as well?\" Basil: \"I'm afraid because of Dr. Evil's previous history, he isn't allowed to enter the secure areas of the B.I.T.C.H. .\" Dr. Evil: \"It's not like I'm going to mess anything up inside the B.I.T.C.H. .\" Basil: \"I'm sorry, the B.I.T.C.H. won't allow it.\" Dr. Evil: \"Could I have someone else go inside the B.I.T.C.H?\" Basil: \"Perhaps. If they have no previous criminal history.\" Dr. Evil: \"Oh, shit. Wait, I don't believe Scotty does.\" Scott: (finally looks up from his gameboy) \"What?\" Basil: \"I believe he doesn't have one. It should be all right.\" Scott: \"What are you guys talking about?\" Dr. Evil: (turns to look at Scott) \"Scott, would you like to go inside the B.I.T.C.H. for Daddy?\" Scott: (points at a nearby lady) \"You mean her? Eh...I guess. I think she might have crabs, though. She keeps itching her downstairs.\" (looks back at gameboy) Dr. Evil: (quite shocked) \"The British Intelligence Technology Chicago Headquarters! Would you like to go into The British Intelligence Technology Chicago Headquarters to get your daddy information!\" Scott: (still into gameboy) \"Oh. Whatever.\" ","Summary":" This story occurrs after the 3rd Austin Powers movie, \"Goldmember\".

I like it here in New York!\" \"Now Cassidy, I know that, but New York just isn't a place to raise a child anymore.\" Cassidy's mother explained. \"Mom, I'm not a child anymore, I'm eleven and a half. And I have friends here, friends who understand me!\" \"You'll make some new friends where we're going.\" \"Their all going to think I'm some city weirdo.\" Cassidy remarked with her arms crossed. \"Look Cassy.\" Her mother began using her parental nickname. \"I know how hard it's going to be to leave everything you know behind, but this will be a fresh start for you, me and your father.\" Cassidy didn't say anything. She just looked down and nodded. \"Good, now you better get packing, your father will back in two days with the deed to our new home.\" Cassidy's mother said as she went through the door. Cassidy just looked at a picture of her and her friends on the wall. \"It won't feel like home.\" She whispered under her breath. The day of moving came so fast for Cassidy, she had enough time to say goodbye to her friends, but she wished she had more. \"C'mon Cassidy, better get in the car or we might go without you.\" Her father joked as he held the back seat door open. \"Just give me two minutes dad.\" Cassidy called out to her father. She turned around to face her friends Jack and Kristin to say goodbye and they joined in on a group hug. \"I'll miss you guys.\" Cassidy said with a crack in her voice. \"We too Cassidy, remember to write alright?\" Jack asked. \"I'll never forget it, Jack.\" \"I got you something so you could remember us.\" Kristin said as she gave Cassidy a necklace with a red charm attached to it. \"Thanks Kristin.\" Cassidy replied as she took the necklace in her hand and put it on. \"Something tells me I'm never going to take this off.\" Cassidy and her friend's shared one finale hug together for time's sake. \"Come on Cassidy, we have to get on the road before any traffic jams start!\" Cassidy's father shouted one last time. Cassidy looked and waved at her friends before getting into the car. Her mother was in the car as well with father at the wheel. He started it up and the engine began to run. Cassidy looked out the window to see her friends waving at her for one last time. They began to fade out of view as the car drove off into the road of the city. It seemed like hours when trying to get to the exit they were looking for. The whole time Cassidy looked out the window with a sad face, she was going to miss New York, the lights at night, the sounds of the streets, even the smell of the cars. Her mother turned her head to look at how sad her daughter was. \"Cheer up sweetheart, I'm sure you'll make lots of new friends\" Cassidy's mother reassured. \"How can you really be sure about it?\" Cassidy asked with an emotionless voice. \"Because where we are going there's going to be lots of kids that are the same age as you living there too.\" Father replied with his eyes on the road. Cassidy wasn't sure if she could believe her dad, she didn't have a choice in this anyway. She was no longer going to live in New York. Her new home was going to be in the quiet small town of New Holland. Disclaimer: I do not own Frankenweenie or it's characters; Tim Burton created the movie.[Chapter 2] Chapter one The town of New Holland was peaceful, or at least it all seemed that way some after the Dutch day incident. The afternoon was warm, the children were playing in the parks and the school kids were going home. Victor rode his bike upon the sidewalk of the street leading to his home where he, his beloved undead dog Sparky and his father and mother lived. Along the way to his house he saw a moving trunk in front of a house that got sold a few months ago to a new family. Three men were taking boxes and furniture inside the house; probably belonging to the new family. Victor stopped to take a look and see who the new family was out of curiosity. As Victor got off his bike one of the three men dropped a box on ground when he tripped. The man had short brown hair that stood on end. He was quite tall and a bit thin. he was wearing a dark red long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, light blue jeans which had a small tear at the left knee and was wearing brown coloured work boots. \"Oh, fiddle sticks.\" The man uttered as he shaped his fingers out of frustration. Victor walked over to the man in a hurry. \"Let me help you with that sir.\" Victor said as he helped the man lift the box off the ground. \"Oh, why thank you young man.\" The man replied with a smile on his face. \"When me and my family found out about this town we knew the people would be friendly.\" \"Did you and family just come here?\" Victor asked. \"Yep. Me, my beautiful wife and my beautiful daughter.\" The man answered while putting the box in the garage. \"Oh, I haven't introduced myself; names Ted Bates.\" The man so called Ted Bates held out his hand for Victor to shake. \"I'm victor.\" Victor replied while shaking Mr Bates's hand. \"Victor; suits you well. Say, do you and your family live somewhere around here?\" Ted asked as he took another box off the trunk. \"Yes.\" Victor replied. \"Well, me and my wife Mel are hosting a housewarming party on Friday to get to know the people of the town and maybe you could tell your parents. You can come too if you want, my daughter might like to meet you.\" \"Ok, I'll be sure to tell them.\" Victor said as he got back on his bike. \"Bye.\" \"Goodbye.\" Ted replied as he waved to Victor. \"To think Cassidy didn't want to leave New York for this.\" It didn't take very long for Victor to reach his house. When he reached the front lawn, he saw his father outside watering the plants outside. He heard his dog Sparky barking and coming through the gate to greet his owner. \"Hey Sparky, did you miss me?\" Victor said as he got off his bike to give Sparky a pat. \"Welcome home, son.\" Victor's father greeted as he turned the hose off and put it away. \"How was school?\" \"It was okay, but Edgar got his shirt stunk in the pencil sharpener.\" \"Oh dear, is he alright?\" \"He'll be fine, but I can't say the same for his shirt.\" Victor answered while trying not to laugh. \"There's something else I need to tell you and mom.\" \"Ok, what is it?\" \"New neighbours just moved in from down the block.\" \"Really? Sounds great, we'll have to meet them sometime.\" \"I already meet the father; he said that they'll be hosting a housewarming party.\" \"And we're invited?\" Victor's father asked in curiosity. Victor just nodded in response. \"Sounds good. When's it on?\" Father asked. \"Friday.\" Victor answered. Victor heard Sparky barking, he turned his head down to see him with a tennis ball in his mouth. \"You wanna play fetch Sparky?\" Victor asked Sparky, getting an excited bark in response. \"Me and Sparky are going to go play fetch.\" Victor said to his father. \"Ok, have fun.\" Father replied while waving to the boy and his dog and going back inside his wife Susan about the new neighbours. Victor and Sparky went to the backyard and started playing fetch. This went on for half a minute before victor accidentally threw the ball over the fence, landing in the backyard where his classmate Elsa van Helsing was playing with her dog Persephone. \"Is this your ball, Victor?\" Elsa asked as she picked it off the grass and held it over the wooden fence. \"Um, yeah me and Sparky were playing fetch and I threw the ball too far.\" Victor explained while trying not to let Elsa see him blush. \"May we have it back please?\" \"Ok, here you go.\" Elsa replied while tossing the ball back to Victor, making him catch the ball with his hands. \"Say Victor, did you hear about that new family that just moved in?\" \"Yeah, I had a talk with the dad when I was on my way home. He said their hosting a party on Friday.\" \"Did you and your parents get invited?\" \"Yeah; did you?\" \"Yeah; me and my uncle would have to go since he gave them permission to live here. Apparently they want to know the people of the town if they are going to stay.\" \"Let's just hope they don't find out about the big Dutch day incident.\" Elsa didn't reply until she looked at Sparky. \"But what about Sparky?\" She began. \"If they see him they're going to start asking questions.\" Victor just looked at Sparky, not sure how answer. He knew that no one had to know about all the dead pets being brought back to life in failed attempt, but not all the details had to be told. He turned back to Elsa. \"Well, it might be ok if they know about Sparky, but not about Dutch day and the experiments gone wrong.\" Victor explained. Elsa just pondered on Victor's answer, and then she replied. \"Well, if you tell them about Sparky, break it to them gently, ok?\" Elsa stated. \"Ok.\" Victor replied. \"Hey, you weren't at school today, you're not sick so what gives?\" \"Uncle gave me the day off, used me as an example of the people who live here. Did I miss anything?\" \"Yeah, Edgar got his shirt stunk in the pencil sharpener.\" \"What, how did he manage that?\" \"Maybe you can ask him yourself, here he comes now.\" Victor and Elsa looked at the gate of the fence where they saw Edgar walking over to it. \"Hey guys.\" Edgar greeted. \"Hey Edgar, Victor told me you got your shirt stunk in the pencil sharpener.\" Elsa said while trying not to giggle. \"I did not!\" Edgar replied with his arms crossed. \"There's no point in denying it, your shirt says otherwise.\" Victor said, pointing out the big tear on Edgar's shirt, showing some of his stomach. \"Ok, I did, but I don't know how it happened, really! But that's not why I'm here. Me and my parents got invited to a housewarming party.\" \"You too?\" Victor let out with surprise in his voice. \"Yeah, lots of people we know got in invited. Toshiaki and his parents, Bob and his mom, weird girl and her parents, even Nassor and his mom.\" \"That's almost the whole class.\" Elsa added. \"I know right? But I don't think Nassor is going to come, I heard he's got the flu.\" \"But how come everyone we know is invited?\" Elsa asked. \"Well, I had a chance to meet the father before I got home.\" Victor added. \"He said that his daughter might like to meet me.\" \"So does that mean we might get a new classmate?\" Edgar asked, sounding a bit excited. \"I guess.\" Victor answered. \"We'll just have to wait till Friday.\"[Chapter 3] It wasn't long until Friday came and everyone who was invited to the housewarming party got dressed in their best clothes and came to meet the new neighbours. Victor was wearing a black tux and had his hair gelled down. Elsa was wearing a dark blue dress with a light blue pattern on it and a pair of black low heel shoes. Edgar was wearing a dark green tax with a bow tie and a small black top hat, weird girl was wearing a light pink formal looking dress, Bob was wearing a black tux with a red polka dot bow tie and Toshiaki was wearing a black dress shirt with a dark red neck tie, dark grey slacks and black sneakers, even though they weren't formal. Just about all of Victor's classmates were there with their parents, except Nassor. \"Looks like the gang's here.\" Victor stated. \"Except Nassor, I told you he wouldn't come.\" Edgar added. \"But his mom came.\" Toshiaki added. \"My mom told me if I didn't come she would stop giving me my allowance.\" \"How come Nassor didn't come?\" Bob asked. \"I think He's got the flu.\" Weird girl answered. \"Ok everyone, we can't tell these people about the dead pets or the whole thing that happened on Dutch day; got it.\" Victor explained. \"Got it?\" Everyone else replied. Before anyone else could talk, Ted Bates, the host of the party approached the group with a woman by his side, a young girl and Victor's parents. The woman had strawberry blond hair going down to her shoulders, light blue eyes, thick eyes lashes and was wearing a red dress with red high heels. The young girl had light brown hair like Ted, but hers went down to her elbows. Her eyes were a dark shade of blue, she was a bit thin, and she was wearing a necklace with a red charm on it, a black dress with black and white striped sleeves, a pair of black and white stockings and a pair of blue sneakers. \"And this is my son Victor, who I believe you have already met.\" Victor's father said. \"Yes I have.\" Ted replied. \"Fine boy he is.\" Ted looked over to Elsa. \"And most be the mayor's niece.\" Ted assumed. \"I wish otherwise.\" Elsa replied with no enthusiasm. \"Well, this looks like a nice little group.\" The remarked. \"Oh I almost forgot. Everyone, this is my lovely wife Mel.\" Ted said putting his arm around Mel. \"And this is our daughter, Cassidy.\" Mel said as she put her hand on the girl's shoulder. \"Hey.\" Cassidy let out, sounding a bit depressed. \"You'll have to forgive her; she's been like this ever since we left New York.\" Mel reassured. \"She seems like a very nice girl.\" Victor's mother remarked. \"Well, we'll leave you kids alone to get to know each other while the adults do the same.\" Ted said before walking off with Mel and Victor's parents to talk to all the other adults. Cassidy turned her head to look at Victor and his friends, but she didn't say anything. After five seconds of no words, Victor broke the silence. \"So you're from New York?\" Victor asked politely. \"Yep, the city that never sleeps.\" Cassidy answered, still sounding gloomy. \"Why so glum?\" Edgar asked, taking off his top hat. \"I just miss home. And my friends.\" \"Moving from another place isn't so bad.\" Toshiaki stated. \"I moved here from Japan when I was six, but I came to like New Holland; apart from the common thunderstorms and lighting.\" \"Thunderstorms and lighting?\" Cassidy asked, raising and eyebrow. \"Yep; lighting happens all the time here.\" Toshiaki remarked. Cassidy just looked at Toshiaki with a confused face before talking again. \"Hey, you guys know my name but I don't yours.\" She said while rubbing the back of her neck. \"Well, I'm Victor Frankenstein. Victor said introducing himself. \"I'm Elsa.\" Elsa fallowed. \"Edgar E Gore.\" Edgar stated in a grim tone. \"I'm Bob.\" Bob said standing behind Elsa. \"I am Toshiaki Zaraki.\" Toshiaki stated while holding out his hand for Cassidy to shake. \"I like your name; it's good to the ear.\" Cassidy replied while shaking Toshiaki's hand. Cassidy looked over everyone else to see weird girl standing behind everyone. \"What about you?\" Cassidy asked. \"Hm?\" \"What's your name?\" \"Well, everyone just calls me Weird girl. But my name is Marie.\" \"Why does everyone call you-\" Cassidy couldn't finish her question because of Toshiaki putting his hand in front of her mouth to stop her from asking. \"Don't ask, you'll hurt her feelings.\" He said with a grim voice. Cassidy didn't know how to reply to that. She just turned her head in confusion. \"So is this everybody?\" She asked, turning to a new subject. \"Well, not really.\" Victor muttered while rubbing the back of his neck. \"Really? Who's missing?\" \"Nass-\" Before Victor could say anything else, he heard the sound of a barking dog. He knew that bark sounded familiar, it sounded just like Sparky. He was not meant to be there, he was supposed to be back at Victor's house in the backyard. It probably wasn't Sparky, but Victor couldn't take any chances. \"Uh, could you please excuse me; I think I left something behind the fence.\" Victor explained while walking off to find the source of the barking, leavening Cassidy and the others in confession. Victor ran to the gate of the Bates's backyard fence, where the sound of barking could be heard. As soon as he came to the other side, he saw Sparky wagging his tail and barking with excitement. \"Sparky, you're not supposed to be here!\" Victor whispered to make sure no one heard him. \"You have to go home before someone-\" \"Is this your dog?\" Victor's eyes went wide with fear when he heard a female voice behind him. He turned around quickly to see Cassidy standing there and starring at Sparky. \"Cassidy, before you freak out let me explain.\" Victor said with fear in his voice. \"There's bolts' coming out of his neck. And he's covered in stitches.\" Victor knew lies could not cover this. He had to tell the truth. \"Ok look, I'll tell you what's going on, but you can't tell your parents.\" Victor remarked. \"This is my dog, Sparky. He's not like other dogs. In fact, he's dead.\" Hearing Victor saying that made Cassidy's eyes go wide, but she didn't run or scream. \"You brought an animal back from the dead?\" She asked, just standing there. \"You could say that, yes.\" Victor answered with a quiver in his voice. Cassidy's eyes went back to normal. She still stood there, not running away or screaming. Then she smiled. \"Cool.\" She said, making Victor surprised. \"Wait, you're not going to freak out or run away screaming?\" Victor asked with his head tilted. \"Why should I? I've seen lots of weird things; nothing can freak me out.\" Sparky immediately took a liking to Cassidy and came over to her, barking in Delight. \"You're actually kinda cute.\" She said while giving Sparky a pat on his head. \"You're not going to tell your parents are you?\" Victor asked while rubbing the back of his neck. \"Why not?\" \"Well, something happened in this town a few months ago and the mayor said that no one should know about it. And most of it was my fault.\" \"Oh. Don't worry I won't tell.\" \"You won't?\" \"I shall speak no evil.\" Victor felt relieved when he heard Cassidy's words. He looked at Sparky and decided he should take him home. \"Come on Sparky, I better take you back home before Cassidy's parents see you.\" Victor said while singling Sparky to fallow him. \"I'll come with you.\" Cassidy remarked, walking up to Victor. The two kids and the dog started going to the next block where the Frankenstein house was. \"So who is the Elsa girl?\" Cassidy asked with a sly voice. \"Is she your girlfriend?\" When Victor heard the word girlfriend in that sentence, his eyes went wide and his heart started to beat faster. He had a thing for Elsa, but he didn't have the guts to ask her out on a date yet. \"No she's not!\" Victor replied with a nervous tone and his face going red. \"Why would you think she's my girlfriend?\" \"Sorry I was only asking! I just noticed the way you looked at her, almost like you don't want to look away from her.\" Hearing this made Victor confused. Cassidy was being descriptive about the way Victor looks at Elsa. \"You're being really descriptive.\" Victor remarked with his hands in his pockets. \"How come?\" \"Well I hope to become a writer when I'm an adult.\" Cassidy replied. \"And I have this habit of studying people who I think are interesting. I have a feeling there's going to be lots of interesting people in this town.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. I like to draw too, but that's more of a hobby.\" \"Maybe you can show me and the gang sometime.\" Victor and Cassidy didn't notice they had reached Victor's house until Sparky started barking. Victor walked over to the gate of the backyard, opened it and let Sparky go through. \"I don't know how you got out Sparky, but you have to stay here.\" Victor said in a serious tone. \"We can't let Cassidy's parents know about you yet, ok?\" Sparky just sat down and whimpered in response. He knew what Victor didn't want him to do. \"I'll make it up to you later and we'll play; ok?\" Victor explained, cheering Sparky up and making him bark in Delight. \"Ok, I'll see you later.\" Victor locked the gate of the fence to make sure Sparky wouldn't get out again and left him alone to play with a baseball with Persephone across the wooden fence. With that done, Victor and Cassidy started going back to the party. \"You have a great dog.\" Cassidy remarked. \"Do you have a pet?\" Victor asked. \"No. Me and my parents lived in an apartment so pets weren't allowed.\" \"Oh.\" Victor felt a bit sorry for Cassidy when he heard he say that. \"Well now that you're living in New Holland maybe you can have one.\" He suggested. Cassidy's face lit up and she smiled at Victor's friendly suggestion. \"You're right.\" She replied. \"Maybe I can get a hamster.\" Victor and Cassidy returned to the party where everything was as it was when they went for the walk. The only difference was that Toshiaki, Elsa, Bob, weird girl and Edgar stood outside the entrance, waiting for them to return. \"What took you two so long?\" Edgar asked with his crossed. \"It can't take that long to take a dog back home.\" Toshiaki added. \"We were just talking on the way there and back.\" Victor replied. \"Right?\" \"Yeah, we were.\" Cassidy remarked. \"Cassidy remarked. \"You guys wanna see my room?\" \"Sure.\" Elsa relied. \"Sounds good.\" Edgar replied. \"Whatever.\" Toshiaki remarked. \"Ok!\" Bob remarked. Weird girl didn't say anything, she just fallowed everyone else. The entire evening went very quickly. It wasn't long before everyone started saying their goodbyes and leaving for home. Victor and his parents were the last ones there before the evening was out and started saying goodbye for now to the new neighbours. \"It's good to know that there are some good people in this town, we're going to love it here.\" Ted said as he shook Mr Frankenstein's hand. \"And I bet your daughter will too, now that she knows the kids.\" Mr Frankenstein replied. \"I hope Cassidy does ok on her first day of school on Monday.\" Mel said, looking worried. \"Don't worry; I'm sure she'll do fine.\" Mrs Frankenstein reassured. While the two sets of parents said their goodbyes, Victor and Cassidy did the same. \"It was great to meet you and your friends Victor.\" Cassidy said as shook Victor's hand. \"I hope we end up in the same class on Monday.\" \"Me too.\" Victor replied as let go of Cassidy's hand and went towards the gate. \"See you later.\" Cassidy smiled knowing that she made some friends today. But she had a realisation. They mentioned someone else who didn't come to the party. She ran up to Victor before he and his parents could leave for home. \"Victor, wait!\" Cassidy shouted out. \"I need to ask you something.\" \"Ok, what is it?\" Victor asked. \"Earlier you and your friends said that one of your classmates didn't come here. Who were you guys talking about?\" Victor stayed silent for one second, and then he answered. \"We were talking about Nassor.\" Victor replied, almost sounding afraid to answer. \"Nassor?\" Cassidy questioned. \"That's an Egyptian name.\" \"But I'm not sure if he is. He might be at school on Monday and you can ask him, but he might not want to answer. Well, I better go home. See you on Monday.\" \"Bye.\" Cassidy just pondered on Victor's words. She became curious on who this Nassor person might be. She wondered why Victor seemed afraid to talk about him. She could not know now, she could only think about it on the weekend and wait till Monday.[Chapter 4] Monday was here. The day was and sunny nice and with only a few clouds in the blue sky. All the school kids started going to school by walking, riding on their bikes or getting a lift from their parents. Cassidy got a lift from her mother, even though she wanted to walk, already knowing the way to school, but her mother insisted. Mel parallel parked on the side of the road across from school. She turned her head around to face Cassidy in the back seat with her bag. \"Now Cassidy, do you have everything you need for your first day of school?\" Mel asked. \"Yes mom.\" \"Good. Now on your way home, don't talk to anyone you don't know. And don't go near any wild animals.\" Cassidy was started to get a bit annoyed of her mother being over protective. \"Mom, please, calm down.\" Cassidy let out. \"I'll be fine; Victor and his friends might help me if I need any help.\" Mel just seat there before smiling. \"Ok Cassidy, have fun.\" She said as Cassidy got out of the car. \"See you after school mom.\" Cassidy replied before she closed the door. Cassidy backed away from the car so her mother could drive off. She watched as the car turned around and went back to the direction why the house was. When the car was gone she turned her head and looked at the school building across the road. Everything seemed new and scary to her, but exciting at the same time. She sighed. \"Well Cassidy, it's now or never.\" She thought to herself as walk across the road to the school. There was a crowed of kids in front of her, either talking or playing a game with their friends. Most of the kids at this looked a little strange in Cassidy's opinion. She was turning her head back and forth, not looking at what was in front of her. Before she could turn her head again, she bumped into someone. After a moment of hesitation she looked up to see a woman wearing a light blue track suit and had her dark hair tied up in ponytails. \"Watch where you're going!\" The woman yelled out, sounding like she was in an angry mood. \"Sorry.\" Cassidy replied, taking a dislike for the woman. Before Cassidy could walk away, the woman grabbed her shoulder. \"Wait just a minute!\" The woman said in a ruff tone. \"What's your name young lady?\" Somehow Cassidy had a feeling that she was in trouble. \"Cassidy Bates.\" She said, sounding worried. \"You're the new student.\" The woman replied, pointing out the obvious. \"The principle told me to come looking for ya and give you this.\" The woman put her hand in her pocket and got a piece of paper out. \"It's your timetable. On the other side is a map of the school and your class number, and it looks like you'll be starting off in science class with Mr Rzykruski.\" \"Science class?\" \"Yep. I have no idea why the principle rehired him; that guy's a nut!\" When Cassidy heard the woman say this, she started to get a bit confused. \"Ok, when the bell goes off go to S.C1.\" The woman informed before walking away. \"Oh. And on Wednesday when you have gym class, don't be late. I don't like people who are late.\" When Cassidy heard this, she imminently knew who the woman was. She was the school's gym teacher. It was only her first day and she already met someone she didn't like. The school bell went off, signalling the students to go to class. Cassidy knew she had plenty of time, but decided to run for kicks. It took at least half a minute to get to the classroom. Before she came in, she stopped and looked at the door. She started to feel cold inside, feeling nervous. She knew that this was the point of no return, no backing out now. Without thinking twice she took hold of the door handle, opened the door and walked right through. The room looked like how a science class should look like. There were two empty seats, one at the back and one at the front to the far left. Cassidy saw some people she didn't know, but she saw some familiar faces. Victor was sitting at the front row next to the empty seat at the front, Edgar was sitting at the right desk next to Victor, Elsa was sitting at the desk behind Edgar, Toshiaki was sitting at the right seat next to Elsa, Bob was sitting at the desk at the right of Toshiaki and Weird was sitting behind Elsa in the back row. Everything was silent until Edgar looked up and saw Cassidy standing at the door. \"Hay look, it's Cassidy!\" He said cheerfully, making everyone else look at the door and making Cassidy a bit uncomfortable. \"Ummmm, is this S.C1 by any chance?\" She asked while holding the piece of paper the gym teacher gave her. \"Yes it is.\" Weird girl answered. \"Well, I guess I'm gonna be with you guys. So which seat can I take?\" \"You can take the seat next to me if you want Cassidy.\" Victor said with his hand on the desk next to him. With that said Cassidy walked over to the desk next to Victor, put her bag down next to it, sat down on the chair and got her stuff out of her bag to put on the desk. With all that done, she started to look around the room, looking at the people and the things around her. There were a few people she didn't know, but if she was lucky the people she did know might show her the ropes. Cassidy came back to reality when she heard the door to the class open. She turned her head around to see a grim looking man come into the room. He looked a bit elderly and shared a very sparking resemblance to Vincent Price. When Cassidy saw the man, she assumed that he was the science teacher, Mr Rzykruski. She just looked at the man in awe as he walked over to the desk at the front. \"Good morning children.\" He said with a thick Eastern European accent. \"It seems that I will be your science teacher once again. Apparently the mayor and principle had a change of heart.\" \"Why?\" A female voice spoke up, catching Mr Rzykruski's attention. \"Who said that?\" Every kid in the class, with the exception of Victor and Elsa pointed at Cassidy. She started to feel a bit on edge because of this. She felt like she was on one of those game shows that were almost impossible to win. She became completely nervous when the teacher started to walk over to her desk. Her palms began to sweat as she waited for him to speak. \"I've never seen you before.\" The teacher said in an almost whispered tone. \"Why don't you tell us who you are and a little bit about yourself.\" Cassidy didn't expect the teacher to say this. She something bad would happen. She stood up out of her chair, faced the class and cleared her throat. \"Um...\" She was having trouble getting the words out, but she kept trying. \"My name I-is Cassidy,\" she began with a shudder. \"Me a-and my parents just moved here... And I hope we can all be good friends.\" Everyone stared at Cassidy after hearing what she just said. After a few seconds later, the students smiled and whispered to each other. Cassidy thought she pulled it off, but the whispers might mean otherwise. Even though unsure she just sat back into her chair and waited for the teacher to speck. \"Well, first, welcome to New Holland.\" Mr Rzykruski said while smiling. \"Second, I don't know why they rehired me, but they seemed quite desperate.\" Hearing made Cassidy a bit curious. She wondered how Mr Rzykruski got fired and rehired, but decided not to think about it for now. \"Well, there's nothing for the new student to catch up on, so we may as way well started with a new topic.\" Mr Rzykruski said as he started to write on the cloak board. \"Well start by working the tropic of Stars and-\" Before the teacher could say the next word, someone opened the door to the classroom. The door opened to reveal a person. This person was male. He didn't look like a kid or an adult, he almost looked a lot like Frankenstein's monster and he was tall with limbs that looked a bit longer than that of an average person. His face had very little emotion and his eyes were sunken and dark, looking like they could steal a person's soul. The top of His head looked flat and he had raven black hair with blue streaks going through it. He was wearing a light grey turtle neck with black pants and Dark grey shoes. He was holding a school bag over his right shoulder, a piece of paper in his right hand and he looked as if he had been sick for days. \"You're late.\" Mr Rzykruski said to the tall boy in the doorway. \"I know.\" The boy replied with a young but grim voice. \"I was sick.\" \"So it may seem.\" Mr Rzykruski said as he took the piece of paper and put it in his pocket. \"Take your seat.\" The boy said nothing. He just took his bag and walked over to the empty seat at the back row, put his bag down and sat down in the wooden and metal chair. A lot of the kids in the class held their breath as the tall boy passed by. But Cassidy stared with frozen eyes. She didn't know this boy, but she just kept starring like she couldn't move. She started to feel cold on the inside; Nervous cold. Her thoughts were going fifty miles per second. \"Who is that boy?\" 2 hours later... \"Ok students, pack up your pencils.\" The art teacher said. \"Next lesson we shall start our research on the Gothic American painting and its influence on culture. Now head off to recess.\" All of the students ran out of the art room, into the hallway and out into the school yard, playing a game, hanging out with friends or catching up on their studies. Cassidy was having trouble figuring out where to go. She hardly knew anyone here and didn't want to run into any trouble. She just kept looking in different directions. \"Hey Cassidy!\" She heard a familiar voice call out to her. She turned her head to the direction of the voice to see Victor, Elsa, Bob, Edgar, Weird girl and Toshiaki sitting together at the same table, all looking at her. \"Why don't you come and sit with us?\" Elsa called out. \"We have a seat saved for you.\" Cassidy felt quite enlightened by the welcome. See walked over to group and took a seat. \"Enjoying your first day?\" Toshiaki asked with his arms folded. \"A little I guess.\" Cassidy replied. \"The science teacher seems like a great guy.\" \"Least he's better at science then the gym teacher, even if it did get him fired at one point.\" Edgar added. \"What do you mean by that?\" Cassidy asked. \"Mr Rzykruski got fired after Bob broke his arm in a jet pack experiment we were doing for the science fair.\" Toshiaki answered. \"Hey, it was also your fault, you made me do it!\" Bob replied. \"Well at least it didn't get any worse.\" \"Didn't get worse? You thought it was a good idea to do what Victor did and you almost got eaten by your pet turtle after that.\" \"Hey leave Shelly out of this! And you went along with the idea by making mutant sea monkeys!\" \"C'mon guys stop arguing.\" Elsa added. \"Arguing makes people sad.\" Weird girl added. Cassidy didn't pay attention to Toshiaki and Bob arguing. She waited for silence so she could ask a question. \"I gotta ask you guys something.\" She said while taking a water bottle out of her bag. \"Sure, what do you wanna know?\" Edgar replied. \"Who's the tall guy who sits down at the back?\" Everyone looked at Cassidy with wide eyes when she asked the question. \"The guy who sits behind me?\" Toshiaki asked with his head tilted sideways. \"Yeah that guy.\" Cassidy said before talking a sip of water. Everyone looked at each other, waiting for someone to answer. Finally Victor broke the silence. \"That's Nassor.\" Victor spoke up. Cassidy almost choked on her drink when she heard Victor's words. She spat her drink on the ground to avoid any more chocking. The tall grim looking boy was the person who was missing at the party on Friday, the one she was curious about. The one everyone was scared to talk about. She looked at Victor with wide eyes. \"That's Nassor? \" Cassidy asked while wiping water off her lips. \"Yep.\" Toshiaki answered. Cassidy took a few seconds to respond. \"He's, taller then I expected.\" She finally let out. \"And that's what makes him scary.\" Edgar added. \"That and that doomsday view of life he has.\" \"Doomsday view of life?\" Cassidy asked in confusion. \"Yeah.\" Toshiaki started. \"He never smiles and he- Oh lord, here he comes now, talk about something else!\" Cassidy raised an eyebrow and turned her head around in the direction that Toshiaki was facing to see Nassor coming their way. She turned her again to see everyone acting like nothing happened, making her go into a state of confusion. The one called Nassor walked past the group in a tired and sleepy fashion, Cassidy being the only one watching him. Nassor didn't take any Notice of the girl looking at him; he just kept walking until he reached the tree across from where everyone was sitting. Cassidy started to get curious. \"How come he's not sitting with us?\" She asked. \"He likes his own company.\" Bob replied. \"And he's really scary.\" Edgar added. \"C'mon guy's his not that scary.\" Victor stated, making everyone look at him in confusion and making him rethink. \"But he does stare at people as if he was stealing their soul.\" Cassidy turned he head to look in the direction of the tree where Nassor was sitting. He didn't seem very scary. A bit strange looking, but not scary. \"He seems ok to me.\" She said with her eyes fixed on the tall boy. \"Seems that way until you talk to him in person.\" Toshiaki remarked. Cassidy heard Toshiaki's comment but she didn't reply until she got out of her seat. \"Well maybe I should go and see for myself.\" She remarked, making everyone's eyes go wide. \"Cassidy no, don't do it!\" Edgar called out as Cassidy started walking over to Nassor. \"Wait, hold on E.\" Toshiaki said as he held Edgar back. \"Let's just sit back and watch how this all goes, this Cassidy girl might have what it takes.\" \"Have what it takes to what?\" Bob asked. \"I don't know, let's just watch and see what happens.\" Victor, Elsa, Bob, Edgar, Weird girl and Toshiaki watched as Cassidy walk closer to the tall boy, who was reading a book and paying no mind to what was around him. He didn't look up from the book until a shadow started to cast over him. He looked up away from the book to see a girl in a black dress with black and white stockings and sleeves looking down at him. They both starred at each other, waiting for the other to speak. After ten whole seconds, Cassidy broke the silence. \"Are you Nassor?\" She asked in an almost emotionless tone. \"I might be.\" Nassor replied. \"Who's asking?\" \"Just a new kid.\" \"The one that everyone's been talking about?\" Hearing this made Cassidy surprised. \"Everyone's been talking about me?\" She asked with her head tilted sideways. \"No.\" Nassor replied while closing his book. \"But my mother did say something about you. She thought you would be a 'good friend'. Yet you know my name, but I don't know yours. Who are you anyway?\" Cassidy looked lost in space when Nassor asked her, making him repeat himself. \"What's your name?\" He repeated, raising his voice and bringing Cassidy back down to earth. \"Uh, Cassidy.\" She said. \"My name is Cassidy.\" \"Cassidy.\" Nassor repeated, pondering over the girl's name. \"Sounds nice. So, did Toshiaki send you here?\" \"What?\" \"He must have sent you here for something; so what does he want?\" \"Toshiaki didn't send me, everyone was telling me about you and how dark and scary you are, and you don't look or seem that way.\" \"I'm not surprised; everyone thinks that because of my freighting looks, I have the personality to match.\" Nassor stood up off the ground and picked up his bag. \"It was interesting to meet you.\" He said with his bag on his shoulder. \"Goodbye for now.\" Nassor walked away with Cassidy watching. She just had a conversation with a somewhat strange but interesting person. She just kept pondering as she walked back over to the table with the group, everyone minding their business except Toshiaki, who had a cheeky like on his face. \"So, how'd it go?\" He asked with a sly voice. \"You are now disturbed of his dark doomsday look on life?\" \"Actually...\" Cassidy began. \"I think he's pretty interesting.\" Everyone at the table looked at Cassidy in surprise. She thought Nassor was interesting? They were stumped at the very thought of it. \"You think he's interesting?\" Elsa asked. \"Yes.\" \"Nobody thinks I'm interesting.\" Edgar stated. \"I think you're interesting Edgar.\" Weird girl replied, pleasantly surprising Edgar. \"You really think so?\" Edgar asked with his cheeks going red. Before Weird girl could answer, the bell for third period went off. Everyone at the table and all different people around them grabbed their bags and started going to whatever class they had next. \"What class have we got now?\" Cassidy asked of Victor. \"I think we've got history.\" Victor answered. \"Hope you like learning about torture and dungeons in the Middle Ages.\" Cassidy got excited about learning about the middle Ages, but her mind couldn't stop thinking about the tall boy sitting at the oak. She saw him as a mysterious figure that at first seemed freighting and alluring at the same time. She now knew how Nassor looked and acted, but it just made her more curious. She just wondered about that boy, becoming more curious and curious.[Chapter 5] Recess was over and it was the middle of history class. The teacher was giving a lecture on torture in Middle Ages, but it sounded quite boring with the teacher's slow speech pattern. Half of the class were either slowly falling asleep or fiddling with their things and the other half were trying to pay attention. Victor had his head down at a piece of paper that he was drawing on, Edgar was fiddling with his pen, Toshiaki was trying to pay attention, but he was having trouble doing so, Elsa just looked at the teacher with tired eyes, Weird girl just stared at the teacher like how she always stared at people, Bob was on the verge of falling asleep and Nassor just looked down at his desk and paying no mind to anything else. Cassidy, who was sitting next to Edgar, looked down at a page in her book and had a pencil in her hand. She was drawing a picture of a person who looked like it was from an anime and it caught Edgar's attention. \"I like your drawing.\" Edgar whispered to Cassidy, making her pleasantly surprised. She took a few seconds to reply. \"T-thanks.\" She replied with a shudder. \"Not very many people comment about my drawing.\" \"It looks kinda cool. Where'd ya learn to draw like that?\" \"I don't know, I've been doing it since I was little.\" Edgar nodded at Cassidy's answer, but he was pondering on another subject. \"So... What were you and Nassor talking about at recess?\" \"We didn't say much.\" \"Yeah; but what exactly did he say?\" \"Not very much. He said it was interesting to meet me.\" Edgar became surprised at Cassidy's remark. Nassor said it was interesting to meet someone? The chances of stuff like that happening were a million to one. \"No way; that's impossible.\" Edgar implied. \"How?\" \"Well he's not the friendliest kid in the school ya know; he doesn't like talking to anybody. He just tells them to go away\" \"Well he talked to me, and he didn't me to go away. But I don't know if he'll talk to me again.\" Edgar didn't reply; he just crossed his arms and went into deep thought. His brain gave him an idea. He turned his head to face Cassidy again. \"I know a way to talk to him again.\" He replied with his fingers together in a devious way. \"You do?\" Cassidy asked with her head tilted. \"Yeah. Music class is next, and the teacher always makes everyone partner up with each other. Maybe you can get Nassor to go with you.\" Cassidy pondered over Edgar's suggesting. Before she could reply, the bell ending third period went off. Everyone got out of their chairs and walked towards the door; Cassidy and Edgar being the last ones to do so. \"Well, you better make up your made Cassidy.\" Edgar said in a sing-song voice. \"Because you might not get another chance.\" Cassidy watched as Edgar ran to the next class. She didn't know what to do. Whenever she went near Nassor she would start to go wild in her mind, but she didn't want to miss a chance to get to know the boy. She just kept thinking as she followed the kids to the music class. When the student arrived at the classroom, they all sat in their seats; fiddling with their pencils or just sitting there waiting for the teacher to arrive. \"Why's the teacher late?\" Cassidy asked of Elsa, who was sitting next to her. \"I don't know; he's always late.\" Elsa replied. \"Least this is better than being at home with my uncle.\" \"Isn't your uncle the mayor of the town?\" \"Yeah; I have to stay with him whenever my parents are on their annual mouth long trip in the fall. But next year I'll be old enough to stay home alone or go with them.\" \"Well, I bet your parents are great people.\" \"They are; but I wish they have such important jobs, that way we could spend more time together.\" Cassidy looked at the almost sad expression on Elsa's face. She wouldn't know what it's like to have her parents spend a whole mouth away because of their jobs, but living with a relative can't be so bad. \"What's so bad about living your uncle?\" Cassidy asked with her head tilted. \"Well, it's kind of fifty-fifty.\" Elsa replied while playing with one of her ponytails. \"He's not mean to me, but he can be very strict and a little selfish. The only reason why he made me this year's Dutch girl was because I'm related to him.\" \"Wait; what's a Dutch girl?\" \"You've heard about the whole Dutch day thing, right?\" \"Yes?\" \"Well the Dutch girl is supposed to sing at the festival, but she needs to wear a dress and a hat with lit candles on it.\" \"That doesn't sound very safe.\" Before Elsa could reply, a man with long dark hair and a guitar came through the door in a hurry. \"Sorry I'm late everybody, long story.\" He said as he walked over to the front desk and put his stuff down. \"Ok, I was informed that we have a new student in the class, so if he or she is here right now, I am Mr Bluestone. Alright, who remembers where we left off last lesson?\" Edgar raised his hand when he heard the teacher's question. \"Edgar?\" \"We were talking about how some kinds of music makes us feel.\" \"Yes; but the bell off and we couldn't do what we going do. Now, as I was saying before the home bell rang, I want all of you to partner up with someone and discuss how certain types of music make you feel. So hop to it!\" Everyone in room got out of their seats and started pairing up with other students. Victor went with Elsa, Edgar went with Weird girl, Bob went with a girl in pony tails and an orange dress and Toshiaki went with a girl in pig tails and a blue shirt and dress. Everyone had a partner. Everyone but Cassidy. \"Sir.\" She said with her hand up. \"I don't have a partner.\" \"You don't?\" Mr Bluestone replied. \"Well there must be someone you can go with.\" Mr Bluestone looked around the room for someone else who didn't have a partner, until he saw Nassor sitting alone at his desk with his head down. \"Oh, Mister Karloff.\" The teacher called out, calling Nassor by his surname and catching his attention. \"Yes?\" He responded with a tired voice. \"Cassidy doesn't have anyone to partner up with, so maybe you could be a sport and go with her.\" Nassor didn't reply for a few seconds. \"Fine.\" He replied, sounding like he didn't care. \"Ok then, problem solved.\" The teacher walked away from the two students to his desk and write reports, leaving the now partnered up classmates staring in silence. \"So we meet again.\" Nassor remarked breaking the silence. \"So it seems.\" Cassidy replied with her eyes facing a different direction. The two students didn't say anything. They just stood there and stared at each other. \"Aren't you going to sit down and discuss with me?\" Nassor asked, breaking the silence yet again. \"Oh, uhh yes.\" Cassidy uttered as she took a seat next to Nassor. \"So, do you wanna start the discussion or should I?\" \"You start. How does music make you feel?\" \"Well, it depends on what kind of music it is. If it's jazz it makes me feel nostalgic, or if its rock I feel like i wanna dance. What about you Nassor?\" \"I don't really listen to those genres often. But when I listen to instrumentals I picture different scenarios taken place in my mind. That's pretty much it.\" Neither of the two students talked after that. They just sat there with their arms and legs crossed. \"So do you like New Holland?\" Nassor asked, breaking the silence a third time. \"A little.\" Cassidy answered. \"Actually, I need to ask you something.\" \"What?\" \"How come everyone in the class is afraid to talk about you?\" Hearing that question made Nassor surprised on the inside, but his face did not show it. \"Well.\" He began. \"It's probably because of my height and how I look older I guess. It makes me look intimidating and scary to other people.\" \"You don't look scary or intimidating to me, I actually think you look like a nice guy.\" \"I could be nice, but there's nothing normal about way I look or act.\" \"Yeah? Well I where come from, normal is just a setting on the washing machine.\" Before Nassor could reply to Cassidy's statement, the teacher called everyone back. \"Ok everybody, time to go back to your own desk.\" Mr Bluestone called out with his arms crossed. Both Cassidy and Nassor were surprised by how short the discussion time was. It went five minutes, but it seemed like one minute to both of them. \"Well, I guess I'll see you around.\" Cassidy said as she walked back to her own desk, leaving Nassor to ponder over the events that just took place. \"That girl is very strange.\" Nassor thought as the teacher talked. \"But she makes me curious. By my standards, that's impossible. I may have to keep an eye on this Cassidy.\" Later that day when everyone was at home getting ready for dinner, the Bates were doing the same. Mel was making leman soy chicken for her husband Ted and daughter Cassidy. The parents were calm while doing what they were. But their daughter was very quiet as a Christmas beetle. \"Dinners ready.\" Mel announced as she put the main course on the table. \"Darling, you should be in a cooking contest; you would win first prize.\" Ted said as he warped his arms around his wife's waist. \"Teddy please, not in front of our baby girl.\" Mel replied with a giggle in her voice. Cassidy rolled her eyes away from her parents, trying not to lose her apatite. \"C'mon mom and dad, let's just eat our dinner.\" She said while putting some bits of chicken on her plate. Her parents did the same and settled down on the table to talk about today's events and enjoy their dinner. \"So.\" Ted began \"how was everyone's day?\" Well I did something I thought I would never do in my life.\" Mel answered. \"What?\" \"I read my horoscope.\" \"You did?\" Cassidy replied. \"What did it say?\" \"Well, I highly doubt what they say is true. But it said that a relative of mine will meet someone today.\" Cassidy's eyes went wide. Her mother's horoscope was right, she did meet someone today. \"What about you honey?\" Ted said to Cassidy. \"How was your day?\" \"Oh my day was fine; just boring fine; please excuse me I have to use the little girls room.\" Cassidy said, talking very fast like she was sugar high. Ted became very confused. But Mel was getting a little suspicious. Cassidy only talks fast when she's hiding something. \"Cassy.\" Mel said, using Cassidy's nickname and stopping her dead in her tracks. \"What happened today?\" \"Why mom, why do think something happened?\" Cassidy replied with her hands shaking. \"Because you're talking very fast. Now what happened? Did someone bully you?\" \"No.\" \"Did you see something traumatising?\" \"No.\" \"Did you get attacked by a wild animal?\" \"No!\" \"Then what!?\" \"I'll tell you if you stop bombarding me with questions!\" Mel just nodded and waited for her daughter to answer. Cassidy sighed. \"It turns out, your horoscope is right.\" Cassidy answered with her hand rubbing the back of her neck. \"I met someone at school today.\" \"You did?\" Mel asked with her head tilted. \"Well, of course you would have met some new people today; it's your first day of school. So who did you meet today?\" \"Some boy in my class called Nassor.\" \"Mrs Karloff's boy?\" Cassidy just nodded, even though she didn't know who Mrs Karloff was. \"Well, looks like you may have made a friend.\" Mel said with a smile on her face. \"Maybe me and your father could meet him, since he was too sick to go to the party. He seems like nice fellow from the way his mother described him.\" \"Well, he's not much of a talker. Besides, he seems like a busy person, he might not have time to chat with us.\" \"Well, how about we have a get together in the park on the weekend? Maybe all your new friends can come and we can get to know them.\" \"What? Mom, we just-\" Cassidy could finish her sentence because of her father interrupting her. \"Actually, that sounds like a good idea.\" Ted said with his arms crossed. \"Cassidy, why don't ask your friends if they can come?\" \"Dad, I-\" \"Then it's settled.\" Mel said, interrupting Cassidy from finishing her sentence. \"We'll have a get together with Cassidy's classmates and their parents; if they're not busy on Sunday. You better ask them next time you see your friends Cassy.\" Cassidy just stared at her mother with narrowed eyebrows. \"I'll ask them tomorrow.\" She said with an angered voice. Meanwhile at a house with a mailbox that had the number twenty six on it, Mrs Nanu Karloff and her son Nassor were reading different books at the dining room table. Nanu didn't look very much like her son, but she had black raven hair going down to her elbows and deep brown eyes like he did. The mother and son were both absorbed into their books, but Nanu decided to break the silence. \"So how was school sweetheart?\" Nanu asked of her son, catching his attention and putting his book down. \"It was quite average.\" Nassor replied while stretching his arms. \"I met some new girl today.\" \"Really? Was she the girl who moved in recently?\" Nassor didn't say anything; he just nodded. \"She seems like a very nice girl. She might even make a good friend.\" \"Mother, the only thing we did was talk and nothing else. I don't think we'll ever be friends.\" \"Well, you'll never know for sure if you don't get to know her. Personality is the key as your grandfather always said. And besides, when I see at a special event at school, you're always alone. Just think it over; this could be a chance to make a friend.\" Nanu got out of her chair and walked away into the living room, leaving her son to ponder. Nassor only just met Cassidy. He didn't know that much about her. His mother didn't know much about her, but she is a very accepting woman. He just sat there, staring into the wood of the table top. \"She does have a point.\" He thought to himself, running his right hand through his black raven hair. \"I don't have a lot of friends, apart from my classmates. But they're all scared of me, but Cassidy isn't. She even said I looked like a nice guy. Maybe mother is right; this could be a chance to make a friend who won't judge me by looking at me; starting tomorrow.\" AN- I read somewhere that Nassor is based on the actor Boris Karloff. So I figured that Nassor's surname might be Karloff.[Chapter 6] Warning: This chapter contains dodge ball violence and brief vomiting. You have been warned. Read at your own risk. Tuesday morning came quite quickly. The first period of the school day was gym. Everyone in the class was wearing basic sports uniforms; white t-shirts with black shorts and sports shoes. A lot of the students were doing warm ups like stretches and sit ups. While a lot of the kids were doing all that, a boy with a bowl hair cut was in the background doing something with the dodge balls, but no one noticed. \"I'm glad I didn't come late.\" Cassidy said to Victor while stretching her arms. \"The teacher seems scary.\" \"She's not scary, she's just grouchy.\" Victor replied while stretching his leg. \"I saw her earlier today and she seemed like she was in a good mood. With any luck she won't make us run five laps around the gym.\" \"Hope not.\" When Cassidy finished her reply, the gym teacher came through the doors with a bag over her shoulders. \"Alright you marshmallows, listen up!\" She yelled out in a rough tone. \"You're all pretty lucky today, because I'm in a good mood this morning.\" \"Told you.\" Victor whispered to Cassidy. \"Now listen well; I don't wanna hear any 'oh c'mons, I don't wanna anyone complaining when I say the words...\" The gym took the bag off her shoulders, unzipped it and took a dodge ball out. \"Dodge ball.\" She said with a smirk on her face. Upon hearing those words, half the kids in the class started cheering and high fiveing each other. \"Alright then; Toshiaki, you'll be captain of team red; Barry K, you're blue team captain. Now pick your team mates!\" Toshiaki and Barry took turns of picking team mates, going boy, girl, boy, girl. Toshiaki picked Edgar first, and then Barry picked Victor. Toshiaki picked Cassidy, and then Barry picked a girl with brown pigtails. Toshiaki picked Bob, and then Barry picked Nassor. Toshiaki picked Weird girl, then Barry picked Elsa and the picking went on till there was no one left. \"You know all the rules; if you get hit your out of the game and sit on the bleachers.\" The teacher with the whistle in her hand. \"Whoever's team runs out of players first loses and as the game goes on I'll add another ball. Without any more yip-yap, PLAY BALL!\" As soon as the heard the whistle that signalled the start of the game, they went crazy and threw the dodge balls they had with brute force. Bob was the first person to get hit with a ball, hitting on his left shoulder. Toshiaki threw a hard ball at Victor, hitting him at the right knee and sending him to the sideline. Nassor threw a ball at Edgar when his back was turned, hitting his hunch. Toshiaki threw a ball at Nassor, but he missed. Weird girl and Elsa both threw a ball at each other at the same time; both hitting each other and being sent to the sideline. Cassidy threw a hard ball at Barry and Nassor threw a hard ball at Toshiaki, both of them hitting their targets and making themselves the only players on the field. Cassidy looked at Nassor with a surprised as Nassor looked at her with a surprised look. \"Oh great; I have to hit Nassor to win this.\" Cassidy thought to herself. \"But I'm not going to go easy on him just because.\" \"Oh great; I have to hit Cassidy to win this.\" Nassor thought to himself, having the exact same thoughts as Cassidy. \"But I won't go easy on her just because she's a girl.\" Without any hesitation, both Cassidy and Nassor started throwing the dodge balls they had on their sides of the field with brute force. They both threw the dodge balls with grace and dodged them swiftly, everyone watching with their eyes wide open. While the game kept on going, the teacher threw in another set of balls to Cassidy and Nassor. The ball Cassidy caught was a bit heavy, but she didn't notice. She saw Nassor grabbing two dodge balls off his side of the court and Cassidy saw her chance. She threw the ball with all her might; sending flying across the line. Nassor turned around, but it was too late for him. The ball slammed right into his gut, making him collapse onto the ground on a knee with a hand on the ground and the other clutching his stomach. All the kids on Toshiaki's team started cheering. Some clapping and others going up to Cassidy to congratulate her. \"Nice job Cassidy.\" Victor said with his hand on Cassidy's shoulder. \"Not bad for a girl.\" Toshiaki remarked. \"Good job Bates.\" The gym teacher remarked. Cassidy smiled at all the attention she was getting just for winning the game, but her attention was put on Nassor when she noticed he had trouble getting up off the ground. \"Hey Nassor are you ok?\" She asked as she bolted over to him. Nassor didn't say anything. He just stood up weakly with his back hunched over and looked a bit ill. \"Oh god.\" He uttered with right hand over his mouth and his left clutching his gut. Nassor looked around fiercely for something as if his life depended on it. There was a garbage can next to the bleachers and Nassor started running towards it as fast as his long legs could carry him. He grabbed the rim of the trash can and started throwing up, with everyone watching. \"Eeewww!\" Half the class let out with sour faces. \"Taken down by a dodge ball.\" Toshiaki muttered with his arms crossed. \"Never thought it would happen to Nassor.\" The gym teacher grew incredibly suspicious of how a dodge ball could make a person throw up, so she had to investigate. She took a look at the ball that hit Nassor and exclaimed it. After a brief second of examine the ball, the teacher realised that it was not a dodge ball. \"Alright, who did this!?\" The teacher yelled with the ball under her arm. \"Who did what?\" Nassor asked with his voice sounding ill from the vomiting. \"One of you switched a dodge ball with this medicine ball! So who was it!? Did you do it Gore!?\" \"No, it wasn't me, I swear!\" Edgar replied with his hands covering his face. The teacher just stared at the hunch backed boy. \"No, it couldn't be you.\" She stated. \"You're too little to lift a medicine ball.\" \"Um, ma'am?\" Cassidy asked. \"Shouldn't someone take Nassor to the nurse's office? Now?\" \"Ok then, go.\" Cassidy walked over to Nassor to help him up from his spot near the trash can. She put his arm around her shoulder and started going towards the door to the hallway. \"Thanks for helping me.\" Nassor said weakly to Cassidy as they were now halfway through the hallway. \"Sorry for hitting you in the gut.\" Cassidy replied. \"That's ok. You didn't know it was a medicine ball. I'm just surprised the teacher didn't notice how heavy it was when she tossed it to you.\" \"I didn't really notice either. I was too focused on the game.\" \"You are quite strong too.\" \"And you've got good reflexes.\" \"Ditto.\" The two students reached the nurse's office and dragged themselves into the room to speck with the woman at the front desk, who looked very bored. \"Umm excuse us?\" Cassidy let out. \"Yes?\" The woman replied with a bored look. \"My friend needs to see the nurse.\" \"Wait in the sick room and I'll call her.\" Cassidy and Nassor walked into the examination room and waited about five minutes before a nurse with long brown messy hair and big round glasses came in. \"So, I'll be your nurse today.\" She began. \"Who's the patient and what's the matter?\" \"I need help.\" Nassor said quietly with his hand clutching his stomach. \"Ok, what's the problem?\" \"Well, it was gym class.\" Cassidy stated. \"We were playing dodge ball and one of the dodge balls got switched with a medicine ball and I accidentally may have made his stomach collapse by hitting him in the gut with it.\" \"Why do you think you made his stomach collapse?\" \"Because I threw up a few seconds after.\" Nassor added. \"Well, I'll let take a look at you. I highly doubt your stomach has collapsed young man.\" The nurse started to exam Nassor and quickly came up with a diagnosis. \"Well there seems to be nothing wrong with you.\" She stated \"But it's probably best if you have the rest of the day off. I'll have to call your mother. What's your name?\" \"Nassor Karloff.\" Nassor replied. The nurse nodded and left the room to get the phone in the office, leaving Nassor alone with Cassidy. \"Well that went pretty well.\" Cassidy remarked. \"Yeah, but my mother will freak out when she gets that call.\" Nassor added. \"She'll never let me play dodge ball ever again after this.\" \"Oh c'mon it was only a onetime thing. Besides, it was my fault anyway. And if your mom says you can't play, your dad might think otherwise.\" Nassor didn't reply. He just looked down at the floor. \"I don't have a father.\" He finally said with his head faced down to the floor. Cassidy's eyes went a little wide. She stayed silent for a few seconds. \"Sorry.\" She said while rubbing the back of her neck. \"It's fine.\" Nassor replied in a quiet voice. The two of them stopped talking after that. They just sat in the room and waited Nassor's mother to come and pick him up. After at least ten minutes or so, a woman came into the room. She had black raven hair going down to her shoulders and her eyes were Ebony black. She had a pair of glasses on her face and she was wearing a dark red long sleeved shirt and a black long skirt with dark grey shoes. \"Nassy, what happened to you?\" The woman asked in a soft voice. \"Mother, please don't call me Nassy when there's other people around.\" Nassor replied with his hand on his forehead. \"I'm fine; I just took a beating in a game of dodge ball.\" \"Dear lord, that game shouldn't be compulsory.\" \"Hi Mrs Karloff.\" Cassidy let out. Nassor's mother turned her head to face Cassidy. \"Oh hello there.\" She replied with a smile. \"Aren't you the girl who just moved in from down the block?\" \"Yes she is.\" Nassor implied. \"Cassidy, this is my mother. Mother, this is Cassidy.\" \"Well, it's Nice to meet you.\" Cassidy said to Mrs Karloff. \"Ditto. You seem like a very nice girl.\" \"Thanks. My parents are planning on having a get together in the park on Sunday and they asked me to ask you if you and Nassor would wanna come if you don't have any other plans. So you wanna?\" \"If course. We won't be doing anything else. Right dearest?\" Nassor only nodded in response. \"Ok then, what time?\" Mrs Karloff asked. \"Around midday.\" Cassidy answered. \"See you then.\" Mrs Karloff turned her head around to face her son. \"C'mon Nassor, it's time to go home.\" She said while holding the door open. \"What about my school bag?\" Nassor replied. \"I already have it in the car.\" As he and his mother walked out the door, Nassor waved goodbye to Cassidy as she did the same. There was no point of her staying in the nurse's office, so she started to make her way back to gym class. As soon as she got back, she saw a boy with a bowl based haircut putting away the equipment with a grumpy look on his face and the gym teacher watching him with her arms crossed and tapping her foot. \"Where's everyone else?\" Cassidy asked while looking around the room. \"They're all in the change rooms.\" The teacher replied, pointing to the girls' locker room. \"Go ahead and get dressed.\" Cassidy went ahead and rushed into the girls' locker room to see Elsa putting her normal shoes on. \"Hey, Cassidy's back.\" She said when she noticed Cassidy come through the doorway. \"Hey Elsa.\" Cassidy replied as she went into a Change room to change back into her normal clothes. \"Who's the kid cleaning up the gym?\" \"The kid who switched the medicine ball. So, is Nassor ok?\" \"He's ok, but his mom picked him up and took him home. Just to be safe.\" \"From I've seen she seems a bit protective.\" Cassidy came out of the change room, now in her normal clothes. \"He said he doesn't have a father.\" Cassidy stated. \"What exactly is he implying?\" \"He doesn't like to talk about it.\" A female voice said from the side. Cassidy and Elsa turned their heads around to see weird girl. \"Whenever someone brings it up, he says nothing and just walks away.\" She informed. \"Why not?\" Cassidy asked. \"No one will ever know.\" Elsa said picking up her bag and preparing to leave. \"I'll see you two at period two.\" \"Wait, Elsa.\" Cassidy called out. \"Yeah?\" \"Me and my parents are having a get together in the park on Sunday. Do you wanna come?\" \"I guess I can. My patents are home and know they'll say yes. If I was still living with my uncle he'd say no on the spot.\" \"What about you WG?\" \"I'd love too.\" Weird girl replied. \"Ok then, see you girls next period.\" With all that said and done, the three pre-teen girls walked out of the change rooms just in time when the bell to go off. Cassidy asked the rest of the Boys of the group if they wanted to come to the get together, all of them saying they had to check with their parents when they got home. And the parents agreed to go to the get together.[Chapter 7] Not much happened between the days of Tuesday and Sunday. Everything just went on as normal for everyone up until Sunday came. Everyone who was invited came to the get-together in the park. Everyone was dressed in casual clothing and brought something to share with everyone else. All the kids who came with their parents just sat on a sheet laid down on grass and were left alone to chat. But all there was an awkward silence among the children. \"I see you all came.\" Cassidy pointed out, trying break the silence. The children still stayed silent. \"So Victor; how did you spend your Saturday?\" Cassidy asked of Victor with a smile on her face. \"Not much.\" Victor replied. \"I just helped my parents around the house and took Sparky for walk.\" \"Seems like an avenge day for you.\" Nassor added with his head in a book. \"Well, what did you do?\" Bob asked. \"I just read some books. Mostly Stephen King.\" \"You really like your horror.\" Toshiaki implied. \"Well, I like reading too.\" Edgar stated. \"Yeah; you like reading comic books.\" Toshiaki replied. \"Hey, I read real books!\" \"Like what? Where the wild things are?\" \"Yeah, cause anyone at any age can read it no matter how old!\" \"Alright guys; break it up!\" Elsa called out as she separated the boys from each other. Everyone went silent again. This went on for five whole minutes. \"Maybe we should do something.\" Weird girl suggested. \"We could.\" Victor replied. \"But what?\" \"How bout we play hide and seek?\" Edgar suggested. \"Isn't the park a bit small to play a good game of hide and seek?\" Toshiaki asked. \"I don't think so.\" Cassidy replied. \"There's a lot of trees and bushes here. It seems good enough to play a good game of hide and seek.\" \"Ok; lots do it!\" Bob shouted. \"So who wants to be it?\" Cassidy asked. No one responded. Everyone just looked in a different direction, implying that no one wanted to be it and making Cassidy sigh. \"Ok, tell you what; I'll be it first since no one wants to be it.\" She said while preparing to count. \"I'll count to fifty.\" Cassidy started counting to fifty and everyone ran in different directions to find a hiding place. Victor hide in a bush near the pond, Elsa and Weird girl hide behind trees, Bob hide behind a large rock near the playground, Toshiaki climbed up a tree and hide in the branches and Nassor hide inside some bushes in the Centre of the park. Edgar was the only one who didn't have a hiding place. He only had half a minute to find somewhere where Cassidy wouldn't find him, so he had to hurry up and find one. He looked around and saw a couple of bushes that looked big enough for two people to hide in. Edgar ran into the bushes to hide, but he bumped into something inside the bushes. \"Ouch!\" Edgar and a familiar voice let out. Edgar looked up to see a rarely surprised Nassor, who was also hiding in the bushes. \"Nassor?!\" Edgar whispered loudly. \"Edgar, go away!\" Nassor whispered back. \"I called this spot, go find your own!\" \"I can't find a hiding place! You gotta help me!\" \"Why should I?\" \"If you let me hide with you, I'll never ask again if Cassidy finds us first. Please?\" Nassor was starting to get annoyed by Edgar's constant begging. \"Ready or not; here I come!\" Cassidy shouted from a distance away. By this point, Edgar was completely desperate. \"Fine; but don't say a word.\" Nassor said as he let Edgar into the bushes. \"Thanks.\" Edgar replied in a whisper. \"You're welcome; now hush.\" Both boys led still in the bushes, hopping Cassidy wouldn't look inside the bushes. They took a peek through the leaves to see her wondering around and looking around with a confused look on her face. \"Don't make any sound.\" Nassor whispered to Edgar. Edgar didn't make any sound. Until Edgar did a very loud burp and signalling the seeker of their whereabouts. \"There you guys are!\" Cassidy shouted as she peeked through the bushes to see Edgar and Nassor looking up at her. \"Looks like I found you guys first.\" \"This is your fault Edgar!\" Nassor said with an angry glare. \"I thought it would funny!\" Edgar replied with a nervous tone and hoping Nassor wouldn't do anything to him. \"Ok guys, don't fight.\" Cassidy added. \"Now go back to the picnic blanket while I find the others.\" Edgar and Nassor got up out of the bushes and started going back to the picnic blanket. Nassor did not look at Edgar at all out of frustration. \"Why so grumpy Nassy?\" Edgar asked. \"That's none of your business.\" Nassor replied with a low tone voice. \"And don't call me Nassy. EVER!\" \"Ok; but when we were in the bushes you seemed pretty desperate to hide from Cassy.\" \"I was not desperate. I just get a bit competitive when I play this game.\" \"Nothing to do with the fact that the seeker was some girl you just met was it?\" Nassor eyes went wide and gave an icy stare with Edgar as the target. \"Shut up.\" Nassor replied. Nothing else was said when the two boys arrived back to the picnic blanket. When they arrived, Nassors mother and Cassidy's mother were standing there, talking with a tray with watermelon slices on top. Nassor's mother turned her head to see the boys coming. \"There you are Nassy.\" She said with the tray in her hands. \"Mother, please don't call me that in public.\" Nassor replied with his arms crossed. \"Sorry sweetheart. Would you like a watermelon slice?\" Mrs Karloff asked while holding out the tray. \"Yes please!\" Edgar added as he took a slice from the tray. Nassor just looked the other way away from Edgar and took a watermelon slice. \"Hello there young man.\" Mrs Bates called out in Nassors direction. \"You must be Nassor. My daughter told me about you.\" \"She did?\" Nassor replied. \"Yes she did. But she said that you're not very a chatty person.\" \"It's true.\" \"Well, from the way she described you, you seem like a nice boy.\" \"That's exactly what she said to me.\" Before Mrs Bates could reply, Cassidy came walking back with Victor, Elsa, Toshiaki, weird girl and Bob behind her. \"She found us.\" Toshiaki explained while picking twigs out of his hair. \"Maybe hiding in the bush was a bit obvious.\" Weird girl added. \"It wasn't obvious.\" Cassidy replied. \"It was just dumb luck.\" \"It was dumb luck because Edgar gave away my hiding place.\" Nassor added \"Not my fault; that pizza was really good!\" Edgar replied. Cassidy just smiled and rolled her eyes away from the sight of those boys. \"So Nassor, I see you've met my mom.\" She remarked. \"Well, you've already met mine, so why not?\" Nassor replied before taking a bite of the melon slice in his hand. \"It was bound to happen sooner.\" \"Yeah, like at the annual school talent show!\" Edgar called out with watermelon in his mouth. \"Talent show?\" Cassidy and Mrs Bates asked with their eyebrows raised. \"Yeah. Every year, the school has a talent show on December 23rd; two days before Christmas. This year, I'm gonna do a magic act.\" \"Don't you think it's a bit early to decide?\" Nassor asked with his arms crossed. \"Not if there's a prize for each category.\" \"How many categories are there?\" Cassidy asked. \"Well, there's the musical category, the acting category, and many others. What I'm doing is in the others category.\" \"Sounds quite interesting Edgar.\" Mrs Bates replied. \"You know, Cassidy would do very well in the musical category.\" Cassidy's eyes went wide as she heard her mothers' words. \"No I wouldn't!\" Cassidy yelled out before she ran off. \"Oh no, not again; Cassidy!\" Mrs Bates called out as she ran after her daughter, leaving everyone with their heads tilted and one eyebrow raised or lowered. \"What was that all about?\" Toshiaki asked with an eyebrow raised. \"Must be a New York thing.\" Bob replied. \"Well, I think we should probably get something to eat.\" Victor suggested. \"Good idea; I'm still hungry!\" Edgar replied. \"Don't eat too much Edgar; you'll get a tummy ach.\" Weird girl replied to Edgar. Everyone walked off to the picnic area where there was the smell of freshly cooked BBQ. But Nassor stayed behind, completely deep in thought and staring into space. \"Why did she freak out like that?\" He thought as he just stood there like an emotionless zombie. \"Nassor!\" Elsa called out, bringing Nassor back down to earth. \"Hm?\" Nassor mumbled as he turned around to face Elsa. \"Are you coming?\" \"Y-yes, I'm coming.\" \"Is everything ok?\" \"I'm, fine. I was just thinking.\" \"About what?\" Nassor Hesitated to reply. \"About many things.\" He said before walking off.[Chapter 8] \"See you all tomorrow students.\" The history teacher said as the bell signalling lunch went off. \"On your way out take a note about the annual talent show.\" Everyone who passed out the door took a note each off the table near the door. Soon everyone went into the hall and made their way outside. Cassidy walked among the crowd of school kids with her bag over her right shoulder, minding her own business. \"Cassidy!\" A familiar voice called from behind. She turned around to see Nassor walking up to her, looking not as emotionless as he normally looked. \"Hey Nassor.\" Cassidy replied. \"What's up?\" \"I wanted to talk to you about something.\" \"Ok; what is it?\" \"Why did you freak out on Sunday?\" Cassidy's eyes went wide when Nassor asked her that question. They started looking and scanning different areas. \"Uh, nice weather we're having, right?\" She asked, going completely off the subject at hand. \"Don't change the subject.\" Nassor replied. \"Why did you run off when your mother talked about you being good in music?\" Cassidy didn't respond at all. She tried to talk, but nothing came out of her mouth. Without hesitation, she ran for it. \"Cassidy, come back!\" Nassor called out to Cassidy. Cassidy didn't come back. She just kept running for the door to the playground faster than Nassor could keep up with. Nassor just looked at her run. \"She's almost as weird as weird girl.\" He thought to himself as he walked to the doors. 2:40pm The bell signalling home time went off, making all the kids make for the hallway and the doors. Edgar was the last person still in the classroom, as it took him a while to put away all his stuff. He started making his way to the door. But he noticed something on the desk in front of him; the desk where Cassidy was sitting. It was a book with a red cover. He walked to the desk and picked up the book, reading what was on the front. 'My cartoon stuff' was what was on the cover. \"This must Cassidy's sketch book.\" Edgar thought to himself. \"She could be looking for this! I gotta find her and give it back to her!\" Edgar ran out of the classroom and started looking for Cassidy outside. All the people walking in the hallway made it difficult for Edgar to see any sight of Cassidy. He looked left, right, up and down, but she was nowhere to be found. He looked around outside and saw Victor by the sidewalk and ran up to him. \"Hey Victor!\" Edgar called out, making Victor turn around. \"Do you know where Cassidy is?\" \"I think her mom picked her up and took her home.\" Victor answered. \"Why?\" \"She forgot her sketchbook. I wanna give it back to her. Do you know where she lives?\" \"I think she lives at 27 evergreens EdWood. It's around the block from my house so it's not far.\" \"Cool; thanks Victor.\" With all that done, Edgar started running to the address that Victor gave him to give the sketchbook back to Cassidy. He arrived ten minutes later. He bolted passed the house's mailbox and stopped right at the front door. He then lifted his hand up and started knocking on the door. \"Coming.\" A female voice called out after the last knock. The front door opened to reveal Mrs Bates answering the door. She looked left and right and looked down to see Edgar standing on the doormat. \"Oh, good afternoon Edgar.\" She said with a smile on her face. \"What brings you here?\" \"Your daughter left her sketchbook at school.\" Edgar answered. \"I was hoping I could give it back to her.\" \"Of course. She's in the back yard. Go right around.\" \"Thank you Mrs Bates.\" Edgar went around and walked to the gate that leads to the back yard. As he got closer to the back yard, he started to hear strange noises. The sounds of an acoustic guitar, and a female singing voice. As he got closer, the sound got louder and the words got clearer. 'Sorry girl, but you missed out Well, tough luck that boy's mine now We are more than just good friends This is how the story ends Too bad that you couldn't see See the man that boy could be There is more than meets the eye I see the soul that is inside' Edgar's eyes went wide as he heard the lovely voice singing the words of the song Sk8ter boi. He peeked over the gate to the gate to the back yard to see who the owner of the voice was. Edgar's eyes went wide when he saw the voice's owner. It was Cassidy. She was sitting a large rock in the middle of the back yard. She had her back turned to the gate where why Edgar was. She was holding a guitar and playing different notes and chords on the instrument. Edgar thought it was the best thing he ever heard in a while. He tried to lean in for a closer look; only to slip and let out a loud yelp, catching Cassidy's attention and making her turn around. \"Who's there?\" She called out looking left and right. \"It's me.\" Edgar replied as he opened the gate and entered the back yard. \"Why are you here?\" \"You left your sketchbook at school. Here ya go.\" Edgar handed the sketchbook to Cassidy and Cassidy took the book from Edgar's hands. \"Oh. Thank you, Edgar.\" She said with her eyes facing another direction. \"You're welcome.\" Edgar replied with his hands in his pockets. \"You have a nice voice.\" \"Thanks.\" \"No really, you have a really good singing voice! It's so good that maybe even the Mayor might like it. But don't let him hear you.\" \"Why.\" \"He might wanna make you next year's Dutch girl.\" \"Oh.\" Edgar and Cassidy didn't say anything else until Edgar had an idea. \"Hey I have a good idea.\" He called out. \"Why don't you enter the talent show? I bet you would win the music category!\" Cassidy's eyes went wide as dinner plates. She turned away from Edgar, holding her guitar tightly. \"I can't!\" She screamed out, almost screaming bloody murder. \"Why not?\" Edgar asked, sounding a little confused. \"I just can't. I never sang in front of anyone because I'm scared that I might mess up.\" \"You sang in front of me.\" \"Only because I didn't know you were there!\" \"C'mon, I bet you'll do great.\" Cassidy's eyes lit up for a second. She turned around and faced Edgar. \"You really mean it?\" She asked as her grip on her guitar loosened. \"Yeah.\" Edgar replied. \"But if you really do wanna be in the show, you better hurry. The entries close on Friday and the show starts next Saturday.\" Edgar turned around and headed straight for the gate. \"Edgar, wait.\" Cassidy called out before Edgar could leave. \"Yeah?\" Edgar asked. Cassidy looked at the ground shyly. \"Do you think Nassor will be there?\" She asked shyly. Edgar tilted his head a little to the left. \"Maybe. Why?\" Edgar replied. \"Just asking.\" Else where \"For the last time mother; I'm not going to the talent show!\" Nassor replied as threw his bag into his room. \"I'm not saying you have to be in the contest dearest.\" Mrs Karloff replied as she quickly fallowed her son. \"I'm just saying that your friends might be there and you should be there to cheer them on.\" \"They are not my friends. They always avoid me because they're scared to talk to me.\" \"Well, that young girl with the black and white dress talks to you and she's not scared of you.\" Nassor stopped dead in his tracks and turned to face his mother. \"What exactly are you implying?\" He asked with his arms crossed. \"I'm implying that if she is going to perform in the show and if you were there to watch, it might make her happy to see someone she knows is there to be supportive.\" Mother explained. Nassor looked down at the floor, becoming deep in thought. After five seconds he made a decision. \"Very well mother; I will go.\" He answered with an emotionless tone. \"But you have to promise me one thing.\" \"Yes?\" Mother replied. \"Don't call me Nassy in front of my friends.\" \"I thought you said they weren't your friends.\" Mother replied with a sly grin and her arms crossed. \"Well... You know what I mean.\" Nassor turned around and marched down the stairs without looking back, Mrs Karloff to herself. She just watched him and smiled. \"He's so much like his father.\" She thought to herself with a sigh. Sorry it took so long to update. Been busy getting ready for Christmas and Boxing Day. BTW, the song Cassidy was singing is Sk8ter boi by Avril Lavigne.[Chapter 9] December 23rd The night of the talent show was finally here and everyone showed up to watch all the different performances to behold. Some people wanted to come from their own choice, while others were talked into it by their parents. A lot of the people were dressed in formal wear for the event. A car in the colour of dark red parked in the lot. A formally dressed Mrs Karloff came out of car in a deep purple dress, holding a dark red purse in her hands and black heels on her feet. Then a formally dressed Nassor climbed out of car. He was a black dress shirt with dark grey pants and black shoes, but he looked like he wanted to be anywhere but here. \"I feel stupid for coming here.\" Nassor remarked as he crawled out of the back seat of the car. \"Well, you should consider yourself lucky that you can even go to watch people perform.\" Mrs Karloff replied. \"Just my luck.\" They walked into the school and into the hall where the show was being held. A lot of people took their seats to watch the show. Mrs Karloff and her son took two seats in the middle row of the right side of the hall. Toshiaki and his family were sitting in the row in front of Nassor and his mother, much Nassor's dismay. \"Nice to see you here.\" Toshiaki said to Nassor, not really meaning it. \"Didn't think you'd come.\" \"Not of my free will.\" Nassor replied. Nassor looked at Toshiaki and noticed he had his camera with him. \"I see you brought your camera with you.\" Nassor pointed out. \"Yeah, I'm gonna get some of the acts on tape.\" Toshiaki explained. \"If I'm lucky Edgar might mess up on his turn and I'll show it to him later so he'll be absolutely embarrassed.\" \"How mature of you Toshi.\" Just as Nassor and his mother took his seats, the gym teacher walked onto the stage and grabbed the microphone on the stand on the stage. She cleared her throat and spoke into the microphone. \"Ok, everybody quiet!\" The gym teacher said loudly into the microphone, getting everyone quiet and paying attention. \"Ok, welcome to this year's pre-Christmas talent show. We have a lot in store for you tonight since we have some pretty entertaining acts for the night. For our first act tonight we have Edgar E Gore performing a magic act, so give a hand for him.\" Edgar and Cassidy stood on the side of the stage with all the other people in the show. Edgar was dressed in a tux, top hat, cloak and a wand. Cassidy was dressed in light blue dressed, black low heels, had her hair braided and had her guitar in her hands. While Edgar seemed excited, Cassidy's insides were cold with anxiety. \"It's my turn, I'm going first!\" Edgar said while jumping up and down in pure excitement. \"Wish me luck Cassy.\" \"Break a leg Edgar.\" Cassidy said as Edgar walked onto the stage. Everyone began to clap and cheer as Edgar came onto the stage. As soon as everything went quiet, Edgar started his act by pulling out a tissue from his sleeve. He showed the tissue for everyone to see and then stuffed it into his left ear. Edgar then acted as if he was waiting for the bus or something. He then pulled out a long rainbow coloured napkin from his right ear, making the people in the audience laugh and chuckle a little. Edgar then took his hat off and showed the inside of it to everyone to see nothing in it. He put his hand inside the hat and pulled out a toy bunny rabbit. \"He's not messing up.\" Toshiaki pointed out. \"He's doing quite well, actually.\" Nassor replied. Edgar then took his wand and placed a napkin over it. After doing some magic hand signals over the napkin covered wand, Edgar took the napkin off the wand to reveal that the wand turned into a bouquet of flowers. Edgar took a bow as everyone in the audience clapped and cheered. \"Why, what a talent.\" Mrs Karloff remarked. \"Why? Anyone can pull off those tricks.\" Nassor thought to himself. Edgar threw the bouquet to the audience before walking off the stage. The gym teacher came back on and grabbed the microphone again. \"Good job Gore. That was truly magical.\" The gym teacher said, not really meaning it. \"I'm sure you all liked that as much I did.\" \"I highly doubt she liked it at all.\" Toshiaki whispered to Nassor. \"Ok, up next we're gonna have someone singing and playing the guitar for us this evening. Please give a warm welcome for a student who has been with us since November. Give a big hand for Cassidy Bates.\" Cassidy took a big gulp as everyone in audience cheer for her to come on the stage. She was scared that everyone was going to laugh and throw stuff like trash at her. She griped the handle of her guitar as Edgar put his hand on her shoulder and looked down at him. \"C'mon Cassy you can do it.\" Edgar reassured. \"But I never sang in front of people in large numbers.\" Cassidy remarked in a loud whisper. \"Just pretend that they're all animals; that's what I did.\" Cassidy gave a confused look at Edgar before looking at the microphone on the stage. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath before walking out onto the stage where everyone could see her. She felt like she was going to pass out or have a nervous breakdown. But she walked up to the microphone anyway. As Cassidy came into view as she walked onto the stage, Nassor looked up in surprise. \"Why is she in this?\" He thought to himself as he looked back down \"Hello.\" Cassidy said softly into the microphone. \"I'll be singing for all of you tonight. I'll be open to some constructive criticism the next day after this.\" With all that said and done, Cassidy griped the handle of her guitar and starting playing perfect chords. Then she sang. 'Playground school bell rings again Rain clouds come to play again Has no one told you she's not breathing? Hello, I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to Hello' As Cassidy sang those words, Nassor's eyebrow went up. He looked up at the girl girl on the stage. He almost felt like breathless. \"She really sounds like that?\" He thought to himself as he listened to the angelic voice. 'If I smile and don't believe Soon I know I'll wake from this dream Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide Don't cry' 'Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping Hello, I'm still here All that's left of yesterday' As Cassidy finished the last word and note of the song, everyone began to clap and cheer as she walked off to the side of the stage. \"Wow; she's pretty good.\" Toshiaki remarked. \"Right, hamster boy?\" Toshiaki turned to face Nassor, who was staring off into space. Toshiaki pulled a confused face at the strange sight beside him. \"Hey.\" Toshiaki called out while waving his hand in front Nassor's face, getting his attention. \"What did you think of Cassy's act?\" \"It was nice.\" Nassor replied fast. \"That's all I have to say about it.\" \"Just what I would expect to hear from you.\" After going through many acts and performances, it was finally time for the judges to choose the three winners. The gym teacher grabbed the microphone again and asked for everyone's attention. \"Ok people; listen up!\" She called out, getting everyone to turn to her. \"The judges have decided who they think should be in the three winner's places. In third place with her voice and guitar skills, we have Cassidy Bates.\" Everyone clapped and cheered as Cassidy walked onto the stage to accept her prize; two free movie tickets. \"How about that? She won.\" Mrs Karloff remarked. \"She has such a lovely voice. Don't you think so sweetheart?\" \"I suppose.\" Nassor replied, not sounding completely sure. Everyone turned their attention to the gym teacher. \"Now in second with his one man band, Kenneth Mckale.\" The gym teacher announced. A boy carrying various drums, trumpets and other interments walked onto the stage to take on prize; a gift card worth fifty dollars. \"And coming in first place, with his violin cover of some song from legend of Astrid or someone that I don't give a rat about, Jackson groomsman.\" Everyone clapped and cheered as sophisticated boy walked on the stage with a violin in his hand and had his head held high to take his prize; a gift card worth over one hundred dollars. \"What a show off.\" Toshiaki remarked. \"Groomsman is gonna go on about this for weeks.\" \"Least it will be over before we know it.\" Nassor replied. \"Not to me.\" ... As mother drove the car along the road to home, Nassor stared at the outside of the window, watching the street lights as he was deep in his own thoughts. Mrs Karloff took a short glance at her son, still trying to stay focused on the road. \"So did you enjoy yourself?\" She asked of her son. \"A bit.\" Nassor replied, still looking out the window. \"Well, I noticed that Cassidy's act got your attention. You should tell her what you thought of her performance next time you see her.\" Nassor looked away from the window and faced his mother. \"Well what did you think of her?\" He asked with tired eyes. \"I thought she was lovely.\" Mother replied. \"What did you think?\" Nassor hesitated trying to come up with a response. \"I really don't know.\" He replied in an emotionless tone. A/N- Ok everyone, here's chapter eight. the next chapter will be the last one and please don't hassle me about when i'll update; i have a lot on my plate. The song Cassidy is singing here is Hello by evanescence as someone requested it in a review, but on the DeviantArt version of this, I used a different song. So goodbye for now.[Chapter 10] December 24th 2:40pm Fresh powdery snow lied upon the footpath and road as the kids of New elementary ran out of the doors of the school with smiles on their faces, for Christmas was only one day away and the first layer of snow finally fell from the clouds. Victor and Elsa walked out the doors, dressed in warm winter clothes. \"So have any plans for tomorrow Victor?\" Elsa asked with her arms folded to keep warm. \"Well, my uncle Martin is gonna come over for a few days before he makes his trip to China.\" Victor explained as he and Elsa walked along the path. \"Sounds fun.\" Edgar and weird girl came out the door holding hands as more snow fell. Weird girl had a happy smile on her face while Edgar had a scarf around his head. \"I really liked the act you did last night Edgar.\" Weird said as she fixed her earmuffs. Edgar replied with a sound through his scarf that sounded like \"thanks\". Toshiaki and Bob were next walk out of the doors. Bob had the kind of clothes to be wearing in cold weather on, while Toshiaki only had a beanie, a hoodie, I thick pair of jeans and black sneakers. \"How can you not be cold in those clothes in weather like this?\" Bob asked Toshiaki. \"I have too much pride; that's how.\" Toshiaki replied with his arms crossed. As soon as the other kids were far away from the doors of the school, Cassidy came out dressed in (fake) furry winter wear, holding her bag on one shoulder and humming the song Lucy in the sky with diamonds. \"What a day.\" She started thinking to herself. \"Everyone sure was excited to get out of here, since its Christmas after all. I better get home before it gets any colder.\" Just when Cassidy stepped onto the frozen sidewalk, she heard the squeaky sound of the school doors opening. She turned her head and body around to see the familiar face of Nassor walking through the doorway with his head down and his bag on his shoulders. He was wearing the right kind of clothes for cold weather, but he looked like the kind of person could easily get cold. He lifted his head up to see Cassidy looking at him with a blank look. \"Are you waiting for someone?\" Nassor asked while walking closer to Cassidy. \"No.\" Cassidy replied with rosy cheeks. \"Are you?\" \"No, I'll be walking to my home.\" \"Yeah, me too. Wanna walk together?\" Nassor took a deep breath before talking again. \"That depends.\" He said in a breathy tone. \"Where do you live?\" \"Just a few walking miles from here.\" Cassidy answered while pointing to the left of her. Nassor looked in that direction for a brief moment. \"Very well, I will walk with you.\" Nassor said as he stood beside Cassidy. \"Cool.\" Cassidy said as she and Nassor started walking. Neither Cassidy nor Nassor talked or looked at each other for a few minutes. Cassidy spoke up and broke the silence. \"So did you have fun last night?\" She asked with her hands on the strips of her bag. \"It was fine a suppose.\" Nassor replied in a blank tone. \"I have to admit, Edgar's act was fairly decent.\" \"I like the thing Jack did. Only because he was playing one of my favourite soundtracks from Ocarina of Time.\" Nassor turned his head to face Cassidy with a raised eyebrow. \"Ocarina of what?\" He said, in a emotionless tone. \"Legend of Zelda.\" Cassidy answered. \"Don't tell me you never played that game.\" \"I'm not into any of that weird RPG nonsense.\" \"Well, that's what you think and it does matter to me what so ever. But if you have second thoughts you can always come over to my house and use my N64.\" \"I probably won't.\" Cassidy and Nassor stopped as they reached the front of Cassidy's house, partly covered in lights for the Christmas season and white show covering the roof. Cassidy turned around to face the boy standing next to her. \"Well, it was nice talking to you Nass.\" Cassidy said as walked towards the front door of her house. \"Cassidy, wait.\" Nassor said as he gently grabbed Cassidy's shoulder. Cassidy turned her head to face the boy with his hand on her shoulder. \"Yes, what is it?\" Cassidy asked with one hand holding the shoulder strip of her bag. Nassor took a bit of time to talk. He wanted the words in his next sentence to come out in the right kind of way. \"What I really thought of the show...\" He started with a shudder. \"I did enjoy it, but it was your act that I only like about it because... I like your voice. So there you have it.\" Cassidy looked stared at Nassor for five whole seconds before replying. \"I knew it.\" Cassidy remarked with a smile. \"There really is a heart in you. I have to say, I like your voice too. Kinda reminds me of Boris Karloff.\" \"Well, just to be clear, I don't like you in \"that\" kind of way.\" Nassor replied with his arms crossed. \"I understood. But that doesn't mean we can't be friends and hang out. Those tickets I won in the contest expire in a few weeks. Maybe you and me could use them up. How does that sound?\" Nassor took a brief glance at Cassidy then looked away. \"Sounds fine i suppose.\" He replied with his arms folded. \"Great!\" Cassidy quietly shouted in joy. \"I'm free the day after New Year's; you?\" \"I'm won't be doing anything in that day.\" \"Cool; see ya then.\" Cassidy was about to open the door of her house as Nassor was about to leave for home. \"Oh, and Nassor?\" Cassidy said as she unlocked the door. \"What?\" Nassor asked his he turned to face to her. \"Remember what you said to me on the day we met? That it was interesting to meet me?\" Nassor didn't say anything. He just nodded. \"Well, it was quite interesting to meet you too.\" Cassidy said with a smile on her face. Nassor didn't reply to Cassidy's statement. He just looked with confused eyes and a confused mind. \"So... See ya.\" Cassidy let out as she went into her house and closed the door behind her, leaving a half dazed and half confused Nassor to himself. He was just standing there, alone with his own thoughts. \"How about that.\" Nassor begin thinking to himself. \"My mother was right about her.\" With all that done and over with, Nassor came out of his thoughts, came back down to earth and began walking back home; thinking about the events that have happened during the past few weeks. FIN A/N- Ok everyone! that's the end of it! but i still have some things to say before the official end. Don't start telling me that there were no video games or video game consoles in time period that Frankenweenie is set in.

Come on, you two; we have a tree to save!\" Sabrina said before she, Nora, and Donnie the Doberman opened the rotting oak doors and ran inside. When the three figures stepped inside, the doors slammed shut behind them, leaving them in complete darkness. \" I've got this.\" Nora said before taking a flashlight out of the pocket of her skirt. \" Oh my! Look who finally decided to show up.\" A deep voiced mockingly called out. \" Show yourself, Mr. B! And give us that sapling!\" Sabrina yelled into the darkness. \" Oh Sabrina, how can I resist a request like that?\" The owner of the voice emerged from underneath the grand staircase; it was a tall round old man with thinning gray hair, thick rectangular glasses, and a large broom mustache. He was holding the pot holding the Golden Apple Tree. \" Hello, Sabrina Drake and Nora Rodgers.\" The man said. \"I was hoping you'd come tonight.\" \" Cut the small talk. This stops now.\" Sabrina spat, keeping her cool. \" Give us that plant, Mr. B!\" Nora yelled, trying not to sound too frightened. \" Not on your life.\" Mr. B retorted with a sneer. \"Once I get out of town, this tree is going to make me rich beyond belief!\" \" Not if we have anything to say about it!\" Sabrina said, furrowing her brow. 0-0-0-0-0-0 \"Moira? Moira Frankenstein?\" Mrs. McHenry said. \"Huh, w-what?\" The little girl stuttered, nearly dropping her book onto her desk. \"Sweetie, I asked you to put your book away three times already.\" The teacher replied. \"The school day is about to end in a few minutes.\" \"Is it?\" Moira glanced up at the clock and saw that it was five minutes to 3:00; a few classmates giggled at her under their breath. \"Oh, so it is. Sorry, Mrs. McHenry.\" Moira apologized as she blushed in embarrassment. \"That's okay, dear.\" Mrs. McHenry said kindly before turning to face the rest of her class. \"Well, it seems to me that we have a few extra minutes to spare before school is out.\" The whole class suddenly cheered, clapped their hands, and smiled excitedly at one another at the mention of spring break; everyone seemed to have big plans. \"But before then, I'd like to know if any of you has anything exciting planned for spring break this year. Anyone, anyone?\" Mrs. McHenry asked before a few students raised their hands waiting to be called on. \"Floyd?\" \"My mom and I are gonna go to the Grand Canyon.\" A round boy in a red t-shirt said. \"How nice. Thank you, Floyd. Becky?\" \"I'm going to the science museum.\" A little redhead girl with a ponytail and freckles said. \"Very nice, Becky. Keith?\" \"My dad and I are going fishing.\" A boy in a black baseball cap said. \"Sounds interesting. Giselle?\" \"I'm going to be the flower girl at my cousin's wedding.\" A blonde girl with pigtails and wearing a pink dress said smugly. \"That sounds like fun. Shelley Sue?\" \"My great-uncle is going to visit us all the way from Japan.\" A girl with braided hair said; Moira smiled at her. \"How sweet. Moira?\" \"Oh, my family and I are going to London to visit my grandparents. We head out tomorrow.\" Moira said proudly. \"London? Oooh, sounds very exciting.\" The bell rang, signaling the end of the day. \"Alright, everyone. It's official; spring break is here.\" Mrs. McHenry said as her students started to gather their things. \"I'll see you all in a week. Have fun.\" \"Bye, Mrs. McHenry.\" The students said in unison as they calmly left the classroom with their bags in tow. \"You're really going to London for spring break?\" Shelley Sue asked as she walked beside her best friend in the hallway. \"Sure am.\" Moira said with a smile. \"And I'm really excited about it. This is going to be my first time on an airplane, too.\" \"You'll be careful, won't you?\" Shelley added. \"A city as big as that could be dangerous.\" \"Of course, Shelley. I'll be with my family the whole time.\" Moira said with a chuckle. \"Good. And I say you're very lucky. It's not every day a kid our age gets to go to a completely different country than our own.\" \"Yeah. Who knows what'll happen?\" \"…Maybe you could go on an adventure or solve a mystery.\" \"Like Sabrina Drake?\" \"Exactly!\" Moira glanced down at the cover of the book she was reading earlier. It was titled: \" Sabrina Drake and the Golden Apples of Atlas \". She smiled before letting out a playful laugh. \"Haha, very funny.\" She said, shrugging her shoulders. \"You know Shelley, I think I've come to realize that adventures like the ones Sabrina Drake has are pretty much the things that happen only in storybooks, never in real life.\" \"Yeah, you're right.\" Shelley said, nodding her head and smirking. \"I heard there are lots of beautiful sites and cool museums in London.\" \"I heard that too.\" \"Oh! While you're there, you need to promise me that you'll take LOTS of pictures.\" \"Absolutely.\" The two girls did a quick pinky swear and smiled at each other before heading out the doors towards the buses that were waiting outside. They waved goodbye before walking off in different directions. Moira was about to climb onto the waiting bus before being stopped by a very familiar face. \"Hello, Moira.\" Giselle E. Gore said; her beloved pet cat Mr. Whiskers II was nestled comfortably in her arms. \"Hi, Giselle.\" Moira said, trying not to roll her eyes. \"You're going to London for spring break, right?\" Giselle asked. \"Yeah… Why?\" Moira replied. \"Nothing. It's just that… Mr. Whiskers II had a dream about you last night.\" \"…How do you know that?\" \"Because this morning, he made this.\" It was then that Giselle took out a small roll of paper towel, opened it, and showed it to Moira. It was her initial, but she grimaced when she realized what it was. \"Did you… get that out of the litter box?\" She asked. \"My mommy says it's an omen.\" Giselle replied with a small nod. \"Last month, he dreamed about Carl; he won a really big prize on the back of a cereal box. He dreamed about Shelley Sue the day she won the annual Spelling Bee. And he dreamed about Darwin the day he got stuck in a tree in the park. My mommy has told me that if Mr. Whiskers dreams about you, it means something big is going to happen.\" Moira looked at Giselle, then at the paper towel, and then down at the cat that meowed at her. She glanced behind Giselle to see her twelve-year-old brother Peter approach and she smiled in relief. \"Hey, what's going on? We're gonna be late.\" Peter said. \"Oh, nothing Peter. Let's go home.\" Moira said as she and Peter climbed onto the bus. \"And by the way, Giselle, you can keep that. I don't want it.\" \"What were you and Giselle talking about, Moira?\" Peter asked as he and his sister made their way to their seats. \"Uh… I'll tell you when we get home.\" She replied as they sat down side by side. At the dinner table that evening, Moira couldn't help but gaze at the meal in front of her with a dazed look on her face. The rest of her family took notice. \"Hey, Moira? Are you okay, honey?\" Her mother, Elsa asked. \"You hardly touched your food.\" \"Oh. Sorry, mommy.\" Moira said, glancing up at her mother. \"I guess I'm just… a bit distracted.\" \"Distracted?\" Victor, her father, asked. \"Is there something bothering you?\" \"Yeah, you've been awfully quiet on the bus ride home.\" Peter added. \"Well… to tell you the truth, I've been thinking about what Giselle said to me earlier today.\" The little girl replied. \"Oh boy. What did she tell you this time?\" Peter mumbled. \"She said something about her cat having a dream about me and an omen, or something.\" She said. \"Is something big really going to happen to me?\" \"Aw no.\" Peter closed his eyes and shook his head before looking back at his sister. \"Moira, it's just Giselle trying to scare you.\" \"Your brother's right, sweetie.\" Victor added. \"All of that stuff about omens, psychics, and people who can see the future is just nonsense and nothing more. Giselle is just trying to get under your skin, so don't listen to her. Do you understand?\" The girl thought hard about what her father and brother said; she usually thought they were always right. She looked up at her father with a small smirk. \"I think so.\" She said with a nod. \"That's my girl.\" Victor said, placing a kiss on his daughter's forehead. \"Now, have you kids thought about what you wanted to bring to London?\" Elsa asked. \"Because we need to get to the airport first thing tomorrow morning.\" The two siblings looked at each other enthusiastically; they couldn't wait for tomorrow. When it was time for bed, Peter and Moira were too excited to fall asleep right away. Their bags were packed and ready to go and they sat on the edge of Moira's bed, looking at a book all about London. \"Wow, this is so cool!\" Moira said, looking at the picture of a large gate leading to a tower. \"That's Traitor's Gate; it leads to the Tower of London which was used as a prison. Neat, huh?\" Peter replied. \"I'll say! I can hardly wait until tomorrow!\" \"Okay you two, it's time for bed.\" Elsa aid, peeking her head into Moira's room. \"Awww, mom! Just a few more minutes.\" Peter said. \"Yeah. Please, mommy?\" His sister pleaded. \"No, kids.\" Elsa chuckled, shaking her head. \"It's already past your bedtime. Peter, you need to get back to your own room and get some sleep. You two don't want to be too tired to even head out the door, do you?\" \"No, we don't.\" Peter said, rolling his eyes and sitting up. \"Goodnight, Moira.\" \"Goodnight, Peter.\" Moira said as she crawled under the covers. Peter walked out the door and towards his own room when Elsa entered. She gave her daughter a kiss on the forehead and whispered, \"Goodnight, sweetheart.\" \"Goodnight, mommy.\" Moira said before letting out a yawn. \"See you in the morning.\" Elsa smiled, turned off the lights, and quietly walked out the door just as the eight year old girl had fallen fast asleep, thinking about all of the adventures she and her family were going to have in London.[Chapter 2] \"Kids, we're here.\" Victor said. The two children eagerly looked out the bus windows and they marveled at a beautiful Victorian styled house as they pulled up to it. The family all grabbed their bags, got out of the bus, and walked up to the front door; Elsa knocked and an elderly couple answered with smiled adorning their faces. \"Mom, dad!\" She exclaimed. \"Elsa!\" They cried as they embraced their daughter. \"It's so good to see you, my dear.\" Elsa's father, Jonathon said before noticing Victor and smiling. \"Oh, it's wonderful to see you too, Victor.\" \"Thank you very much, sir.\" Victor said, smiling and shaking Jonathon's hand. \"Victor, we missed you and Elsa so much since your last visit.\" Elsa's mother, Lydia added as she gave her son-in-law a hug. \"Hey, grandma and grandpa.\" Peter said as he and his sister stepped forward. \"Hi, guys.\" Moira said shyly. \"Peter, Moira!\" Lydia exclaimed, showering her grandchildren in hugs and kisses. \"Look at you two! You've gotten so big!\" Jonathon said, ruffling Peter's hair playfully. \"Oh, come in, come in. We don't want you all standing outside on the cold doorstep.\" Lydia said as the group made their way into the house. \"Wow, this is so beautiful.\" Moira said as she looked around, her eyes wide with awe. \"Thank you, dear. I decorated it myself.\" Lydia proudly replied. \"Why don't you kids go upstairs and get settled in while your mother and I talk with your grandparents for a little bit?\" Victor suggested. \"Sure thing, dad. Come on, sis.\" Peter said, ushering his sister to follow him up the stairs. \"Right behind you, bro.\" Moira giggled as she followed close behind the twelve year old with their baggage in tow. \"Those kids.\" Jonathon chuckled before he turned to face his daughter and her husband; his expression changed from amused to solemn rather quickly. \"Uh Victor, Elsa? There's… something you need to know.\" \"What do you mean, Dad? What's going on?\" Elsa asked. \"What's the matter, Jonathon? What's wrong?\" Victor added, wrapping an arm around Elsa's shoulder. The two elders looked at each other, then back at the younger couple with concerned looks on their faces; something was definitely up. \"You see, some… rather unpleasant things have been happening around the city lately.\" Lydia spoke up. \"Unpleasant things? Like what?\" Victor inquired. \"Like a few robberies, break-ins… but mostly kidnappings.\" Lydia hesitantly explained. \"No one knows who's behind them or why they're happening, but it can't be for anything good. So we'll all need to be on our toes and be extra careful, especially the children.\" \"Yes; if anything bad happened to them or either of you, I'll never be able to live with myself.\" Jonathon said with a sigh. \"Don't worry, dad; we'll be fine.\" Elsa said, reaching out to grasp her father's hand. \"Yeah; as long as we're together, nothing bad is gonna happen.\" Victor added. Upstairs, Peter and Moira were exploring the many rooms on the second floor, trying to find a good one for them to occupy. \"Hey, what about this big one?\" Moira suggested. \"Nah, I'm pretty sure that's the master bedroom.\" Peter said before spotting an open door on the other side of the hall. \"How about this one?\" They looked into the room through the open door and saw that it had two beds and was big enough for the both of them. \"Nice! But maybe we should check with grandpa and grandma about it first.\" Moira said. \"Good point.\" Peter replied, nodding his head. \"Hey, kids! You wanna check out the backyard?\" Victor called from downstairs. \"Coming!\" The children said in unison before leaving their bags by the door and going back down the stairs to see what their parents wanted. When they made it to the backyard door, they saw their parents and grandparents standing in the middle of the most beautiful garden either of them had ever seen. Their eyes brightened when they stepped into this very garden. \"Do you kids like it?\" Lydia asked. \"Grandma, this garden is amazing!\" Peter exclaimed. \"Thanks. I've been working on this little thing for the past few months.\" Lydia said proudly. \"Oh! Kids, there's something else we want you to see.\" Jonathon said, leading his grandchildren to a large tree in one corner of the yard. \"What's up there?\" Moira asked. \"Well, climb up this rope ladder and find out.\" Jonathon said playfully, showing off a custom-made rope ladder. \"Ladies first.\" Peter said, allowing his sister to go ahead of him. Moira rolled her eyes and began to climb up the ladder with her brother following close behind. When they made it to the top, Peter and Moira were surprised to see a beautiful new tree house. \"Whoa!\" They cried. \"You like it?\" Jonathon called. Peter and Moira didn't answer; they were too busy exploring the tree house and seeing what there was to see. \"This is incredible!\" Peter said. \"I know!\" Moira added before opening a small window and gasping. Peter went to join her and they were met with the most breathtaking view they've ever seen in their young lives. \"Look at this view! You can see the whole neighborhood from here!\" Moira said. \"Whoa…\" Peter added in astonishment. \"I take it you kids like the tree house?\" Jonathon's voice asked. \"Are you kidding? This is so cool!\" Peter cried, turning around to face his grandfather. \"Well, I'm glad you think so… because it's all yours.\" Jonathon said with a smile. \" Ours ?!\" The two children cried; their eyes wide with shock and surprise. \"That's right; I built this just for the two of you… with a little help from a couple neighbors.\" \"Well, it's awesome all the same. Thanks, grandpa.\" Peter said as he and his sister descended the ladder back down to the ground. \"Yeah, thanks so much.\" Moira said as she gave Jonathon a big hug. \"No problem.\" Jonathon chuckled, hugging the little girl back. \"Think of all of the adventures we're gonna have this week.\" Peter lamented. \"I'm sure it's gonna be amazing.\" Lydia said wrapping an arm around her grandson's shoulder. Victor and Elsa looked at their children, then at each other; as long as they were careful, they knew this was going to be an exciting week. 0-0-0-0-0-0 \"Is that all you've got? Is that ALL YOU'VE GOT?! Come on; give me your best shot!\" \"HIYA!\" \"Whoa!\" A loud thud was heard, followed by a few gasps for air. \"Whew! Watson, are you okay? Did I hurt you?\" \"Oh no, Holmes; I'm fine. But that was quite the kick.\" A round man replied as he got back up onto his feet. The man dubbed as Watson approached his companion, a man who was younger, taller, and thinner than him. His name was Shamus Holmes. \"You really think so?\" Holmes asked, wiping sweat from his brow. \"Because the last time I did a kick that hard, I punctured a hole in the globe with my foot. And Mrs. Hudson next door was not very happy with us about that; she said we were causing quite the ruckus.\" \"That was because we were practicing in the study and she was lending us the globe; a horrible decision, really. But I must say, you're getting better and better at this karate business. And I could safely say the same about your fencing lessons.\" Watson replied. \"That's because of you helping me train, Watson. You make an excellent coach.\" \"Well… you were always a good student.\" \"Ahem. Mr. Holmes? Dr. Watson?\" The two men turned around to see a young woman in a maid's outfit standing in the doorway with a tray in her hands. \"I thought you might like some water and fruit, sir.\" She said timidly. \"Ah, refreshments. How thoughtful of you.\" Holmes said, taking the tray from her and setting it down on a nearby table. \"Thank you, Naomi. That will be all.\" \"As you wish.\" Naomi said before briskly walking out the door and down the hall. Holmes took a water bottle from the tray, opened it, and took a few healthy gulps of water from it as Watson grabbed an apple and took a bite. \"You really think I'm getting better?\" Holmes asked, swallowing another swig of water. \"Yes, of course.\" Watson agreed before taking another bite of his apple. \"And if you keep it up, you might even earn yourself a red belt.\" \"Who knows?\" Holmes chuckled. \"You always know.\" Watson joked, making his partner laugh even harder. \"Master Holmes, Doctor Watson?\" A third voice said. A bald man with a handlebar mustache and wearing a gray suit was standing in the doorway with a serious expression on his face. It was most likely the butler. \"Yes?\" Holmes asked. \"Someone is here to see you. He says it's very important.\" The man said. \"Alright, send him in.\" Watson said as Holmes nodded. \"Yes, Doctor.\" The man said before another man stepped into the room. \"Thank you. That will be all, Pierre.\" Holmes said. The butler, now dubbed Pierre, nodded and exited the room, leaving the three men alone. \"Ah, Inspector Frederick LeStrade.\" Holmes said, politely shaking the man's hand. \"What brings you to Baker Street today?\" \"No time for small talk, Holmes. There's something you need to know, it can't wait.\" The Inspector said in a rude tone. \"There have been even more reported break-ins and burglaries going around the city… as well as three more kidnappings.\" \" Three ?\" Watson repeated in shock. \"All in one day.\" LeStrade replied. \"That is awful .\" Watson cried. \"Yes, and that's why I've come here.\" LeStrade said, turning to the younger man. \"Holmes, I need you and Watson to take a closer look into these crimes and get to the bottom of this whole thing once and for all.\" \"But why come to us , Frederick? Can't you and your men handle it?\" Holmes asked, raising an eyebrow at the Inspector. \"And if I remember correctly, you said you didn't want me to go poking my nose into Scotland Yard's business anymore.\" \"Never mind that. I came to you because you two are the finest detectives in all of London.\" LeStrade explained. \"My men can't wrap their heads around these incidents and if anything goes wrong, then these poor people would've disappeared without a trace, but I know for a fact that you can find them no matter what. Here's a list of all of the people who recently went missing.\" LeStrade handed Holmes a clipboard containing a list of the missing people along with their pictures and their addresses and a detailed map of a small quadrant of London. Holmes looked at the list, then handed it to Watson before glancing at the map; quite a few places were marked, most likely the places that have lately been ransacked. \"What do you say, Holmes? Will you do it?\" LeStrade asked. Holmes paused and thought about it for a moment before saying, \"We'll see what we can find out, Inspector. And we'll find these missing citizens as well.\" \"We'll get right on it.\" Watson added. \"Good. Thank you.\" LeStrade breathed a sigh of relief. \"Do you know where the latest crimes were committed?\" Holmes asked. \"I do. The most recent was 2697, Robin Lane; home of the Jones family.\" LeStrade replied. Holmes nodded his head at LeStrade before turning to Watson and saying, \"There's no time to lose, Watson; to the scene of the crime.\"[Chapter 3] That evening, Peter and Moira were sitting at the dinner table with their parents and grandparents; they were all eating chicken and pasta for dinner. \"This is great, grandma.\" Peter said, swallowing a bite of chicken. \"Yeah, the best.\" Moira agreed before helping herself to some more noodles. \"Well, I'm glad you kids like it.\" Lydia said with a proud smile. \"You know, Peter. I've been meaning to give you something.\" Jonathon said before getting up from his chair and heading towards the living room. \"I'll be right back.\" After a few minutes, Jonathon returned and kneeled in front of Peter. He then pinned something onto the boy's sweater; it was a small medal in the shape of a dragon wrapped around a sword. Peter's eyes widened. \"Whoa, what is this?\" He asked. \"I received this medal back when I was drafted into the army during World War II, along with a few others.\" Jonathon explained as he and Peter walked over to a small cabinet filled with shining, gleaming medals all from the war; Peter's eyes widened. \"But the one I just gave you? I won this for doing something that wasn't even commanded of me. I pushed one of my fellow soldiers out of the way of an incoming grenade, saving his life. The general was so impressed by my reckless actions that he gave me this.\" \"Wow, cool!\" Peter said before realizing something. \"But… why are you giving this to me ?\" \"This little thing was what got me through the rest of the war.\" Jonathon replied. \"I thought that if I could survive that, I could survive anything that life threw at me. Now that the war is done and over with, I'm perfectly happy with my life and I don't really need it anymore. So I want you to have it, to remind you to have courage and be strong… especially for your sister.\" \"Don't worry, grandpa; I'll always be there for Moira.\" Peter said proudly. \"Oh, Moira? I have something special for you too, dear.\" Lydia said before taking something out of her skirt pocket. \"What is it?\" Moira asked, walking over to her grandmother. Lydia showed her something that looked like a deep golden watch on a chain and she put it around her granddaughter's little neck. \"I had this watch since I was a little girl.\" Lydia explained. \"It was all I had left of my mother before she passed. For years, it was me and my brother; it was tough, but I tried my hardest to provide for us. It felt like my mother was watching us from up in Heaven… and this watch kept me going. And then, after what felt like an eternity, I met your grandfather and we've been happy ever since.\" \"Wow.\" Moira said as she inspected the old timepiece around her neck. \"It's really pretty, grandma. But why are you giving it to me?\" \"Because I feel that it's meant for you.\" Lydia replied. \"I don't really need it anymore, but I have a feeling you might need it.\" \"I love it, grandma. Thanks.\" Moira said before giving her grandmother a big hug. \"You're welcome, sweetheart.\" Lydia beamed, hugging the little girl back. Victor and Elsa smiled. After dinner came bedtime for Peter and Moira. They had just settled into their room and they were starting to get themselves ready for bed. \"Hey, Peter? What do you think is gonna happen during our time here?\" Moira asked as she put on her pajamas. \"I don't know.\" Peter replied as he started to brush his teeth. \"But whatever it is, I'm sure it has nothing to do with some ridiculous 'omen' from a school bully.\" \"…Yeah, I guess you're right.\" Moira said before grabbing her toothbrush from her backpack. \"But anything can happen, right?\" \"Maybe, but I'd try not to think about it too much.\" Peter said before rinsing and spitting. He had already put on his own pajamas before exiting the bathroom to let Moira go in and brush her own teeth. \"Your turn.\" Moira rolled her eyes and headed over to the bathroom. After she brushed her teeth and climbed into bed, her mind was buzzing with all of the possible things that could happen to her or her family while staying in London; she couldn't get Giselle's words out of her head. ' If Mr. Whiskers dreams about you, it means something big is going to happen.' \"Something big, something big…\" Moira muttered, skimming the pages of the book she was reading before she finally shut her eyes and drifted to sleep. 0-0-0-0-0-0 \"God, this house is in shambles !\" Watson exclaimed. \"It looks like the robbers have really done a number on this place.\" \"You can say that again, Watson. Let's split up.\" Holmes chuckled as he and his partner cautiously entered the wrecked house. He made his way to the front room, got down on his knees, and took a magnifying glass out of his coat pocket, trying to find anything that would at least give him a sign of who or what could've been responsible for this damage. Watson hesitantly followed suit, being as careful as possible while also staying vigilant. They've been searching for a good few minutes. \"Find anything, Holmes?\" Watson asked. \"Not yet. I can't even tell where…\" Holmes replied before finally seeing something. \"Wait! Here's something!\" Watson carefully walked over to where he heard his partner's voice was coming from and he saw him on his hands and knees in the kitchen next to the dining room. \"What is it?\" Watson asked, trying to get a better view. \"See for yourself, Watson.\" Holmes said, showing Watson what he had just discovered; it was a set of large, muddy footprints and they were leading to where the laundry room was supposed to be. \"Footprints?\" The elder gentleman asked. \"Yes. And judging by the size, shape, and patterns, the robber must've been wearing some form of combat boot. Approximately… a size 12, wide. Just a wild guess, though.\" Holmes replied before taking a quick picture of a couple of prints; he looked back at Watson. \"We'll need to search the other houses to see if we can find more prints like these; I want to see if these past robberies were all committed by the same crook… or crooks , if may be.\" \"Then there's no time to lose.\" Watson said before looking at the list in his hands. \"The next house on our search is the St. Carolina estate, 2254 Charleton Drive.\" \"St. Carolina…\" Holmes trailed off before stuffing the picture in his pocket and running out the front door. \"Very well. Let's go, Watson.\" \"Right behind you, Holmes.\"[Chapter 4] Three days went by… and nothing very eventful has happened to Peter, Moira, or their family. But Moira kept her eyes peeled; she knew something big was going to happen to her on this vacation, but what she didn't know was when it would happen or what it would be. \"Hey, Moira. You wanna go to the park? It's only three blocks away.\" Peter asked, finishing off the rest of his breakfast. \"The park? Oh, sure; sounds fun.\" Moira said dismissively. \"Are you okay, sis? You seem kinda off today.\" \"Off? What makes you say that?\" \"I don't know. You just don't seem to be… involved lately.\" \"Uh… I guess I'm just tired. Nothing to worry about. Should we head over to the park now?\" \"Sure.\" \"Be careful out there, kids.\" Victor called from the kitchen as Peter and Moira headed towards the front door. \"Remember, we're in a completely different country with people we don't know. So don't talk to strangers.\" \"We get it, dad. We understand Stranger Danger.\" Peter said, reaching out for the doorknob. \"Yeah, we'll be careful. See you guys later.\" Moira added. \"Have fun.\" Elsa said as her children walked out the door. The door shut and Elsa kept looking at it with a concerned look on her face; Lydia noticed and walked over to her daughter \"Don't worry, Elsa.\" She said reassuringly. \"Peter and Moira are clever children, I'm sure they can handle themselves just fine.\" \"I hope so…\" Elsa muttered. Peter and Moira arrived at the park and they saw that it was hardly any different than the park back at New Holland. There were a bunch of trees, benches, a baseball diamond, and even a playground with slides, monkey bars, sandboxes, and swing sets. \"Not bad.\" Peter said, nodding his head and smiling. \"What should we go on first?\" \"Race you to the swings!\" Moira yelled before running over to one of the swing sets; Peter smiled and playfully ran after her. For the next few hours, the two siblings played and had fun without a care in the world… blissfully unaware of the fact that a pair of malicious eyes was watching their every move. \"Whew!\" Moira panted. \"Hey, Peter? Is there a drinking fountain around here? I'm thirsty.\" \"Sure, I think there's one over by the bathrooms. Just be careful.\" Peter said. \"You've been telling me to be careful the past three days. I'll be fine.\" Moira then ran off to where she thought was the bathroom and she saw that there was a drinking fountain nestled right next to it. She bent down and started to take a drink but as she did so, she heard heavy footsteps from behind approaching her. When she finished, Moira turned around and looked up to see a large muscular man standing before her. \"Hello there, little lass.\" The man said; he appeared to speak with a Scottish accent. \"What are you doing here all alone?\" Moira said nothing and tried to walk away, but the stranger wouldn't let her pass for some reason. \"Uh, excuse me, sir? You're in my way.\" Moira said. \"Oh? Am I?\" \"Yes, yes you are.\" \"That's because… you didn't answer my question. What are you doing here by yourself?\" \"I'm not alone… and I'm not allowed to talk to strangers. Now if you'll excuse me…\" Moira carefully made her way around the man, but the man roughly grabbed her by the arm and pulled her back towards him. \"That wasn't the answer I was looking for, lassie.\" He said in a grim tone. Moira's eyes widened in horror; she started to hyperventilate as two more men came up from behind and joined their friend. \"What do you think, boys?\" The man asked. \"She must be American .\" The second one said, eying Moira curiously. \"Are you?\" The third asked as he took out a knife. \"Let's see if she bleeds purple.\" Moira couldn't speak; she was too scared to form any kind of sentence. All she could say was a stutter and the three men laughed before a large stick was thrown at one of them. \"Hey! Let go of my sister, you big goons!\" Peter's voice yelled. The three men angrily snarled at the boy. Thinking fast, Moira stepped down on the foot of the man who was holding her as hard as she could and that surprisingly made him let go. \"Run for it!\" Peter screamed as the three men began to chase him. \"Get back here, you runt!\" One of the three men yelled. \"Over here, Peter!\" Moira's voiced called. Peter turned his head and saw his sister ushering him towards the park gates; he ran towards it. 0-0-0-0-0-0 Holmes and Watson sat around a small table in an empty coffee shop, looking over the evidence they had collected over the past three days. \"Twelve homes robbed; sixty-eight innocent people taken in total. This doesn't make any sense, Holmes.\" Watson said, looking over the list of missing people. \"What do all of these people have in common? Who has taken them? And why would someone go through all of this trouble?\" \"Those are very good questions, Watson.\" Holmes said, taking a sip of tea from his cup. \"For which I don't have the answers for, at least not yet. But just like you, I have plenty of other questions… and that's a start. But these crimes MUST be connected somehow; the same boot prints were all found in every single one of these crime scenes. It can't be a coincidence.\" \"There must be something we're doing wrong. Something we're missing.\" Watson pondered as he took a bite from his cream cheese bagel. \"Yes, there must be… But what?\" \"Is there anything else I can get for you gentlemen?\" A young woman in a green apron asked. \"Oh, no thank you… miss Tillie.\" Holmes said, reading the girl's name tag pinned to her shirt. \"Okay, I'll be right back here if you need anything.\" The girl said before walking away and disappearing into the kitchen. When the girl was gone, Holmes looked over all of the notes and clues he had collected. He furrowed his brow and narrowed his eyes as he scratched the side of his head. 'What am I missing? Come on, Shamus; think, think, think…' He asked himself before noticing something off in a picture sitting on the table. He picked up the photograph and inspected it carefully; they were all the door handles from the houses that were robbed. His eyes widened as he looked at the other pictures he and Watson had taken. \"What is it, Holmes? It looks like you've just had an epiphany.\" Watson exclaimed. \"Indeed I have, Watson. Notice the door handles in these photographs?\" Holmes said, showing his partner a handful of pictures. \"They… they're, um…\" Watson said, trying to figure out where Holmes was going with this. \"The locks on the doors; it appears as though a powerful acid was squirted into each lock, melting it quickly.\" Holmes explained. \"No brute force was used to open any of these doors. And there was hardly any broken glass on the floors, the tell-tale sign of a break-in; so no broken windows or shattered glass valuables either. And these footprints from each crime scene are exactly the same size and shape: size 12, wide… No one I know of has a foot THAT big.\" \"So what are you saying?\" \"The footprints are false; it's all a trick. The thief is trying to play us for fools, and I am NO fool. I'm afraid we have a scientific mind at work here, Watson.\" \"You don't mean…\" \"I do. There is only one person in London who is brilliant enough and evil enough to pull off a diabolical scheme such as this. The Napoleon of crime: Moriarty.\" \"As in Professor Nigel Moriarty?\" \"The very same.\" \"But don't you recall our last debacle with him? When Inspector LeStrade showed up to take him to prison, he already got away. And no one has seen him or heard from him since; it's as if he just vanished into thin air, without a trace.\" \"Ugh, how could I forget? That was certainly a low point in my career. But it must be Moriarty; I can feel it deep in my gut, and you know perfectly well that my gut is hardly ever wrong. No one else in the city is as clever or tactical as he.\" \"But Moriarty always left us a clue: his calling card. And we haven't found one in any of these houses.\" \"Yes, you're right. Unless…\" Holmes lifted his cup and he was about to take another sip of his tea when another thought popped into his head. \"Watson, do you still have that map LeStrade gave us?\" He asked. \"Right here.\" Watson said as he took the map out of his coat pocket and put it into Holmes's open hand so his partner could take a closer look. \"What are you looking for now?\" \"This!\" Holmes exclaimed, pointing a finger to a spot on the map that sat in between two previously robbed abodes. \"Watson, is there anyone who lives in this house right here? 1313 Raven Road?\" \"Yes.\" Watson explained as he looked at the map. \"I believe that is the home of an elderly couple named Van Helsing, Jonathon and Lydia.\" \"Van Helsing… Why does that sound familiar?\" That was when Holmes took a permanent marker and marked the spot in the map; he and Watson saw a large 'M'. \"It is Moriarty!\" Watson exclaimed, standing from his chair. \"Precisely. He has left us his calling card! In a brilliant and unusual way, I might add.\" Holmes said before taking out his wallet and leaving a few pound notes on the table for the waitress to take; he stood from his own chair and headed towards the door. \"Hurry, Watson! To Raven Road! The Van Helsing's are in terrible danger!\" The two men ran out the door and into the rain.[Chapter 5] Peter and Moira were running down the sidewalk as fast as they could away from the park; they were being chased by those three men who tried to attack Moira. When they thought they were far enough, the two siblings finally stopped and hid behind a wall. \"Do you… you think we lost them?\" Moira asked, gasping and wheezing for air. Peter hesitantly glanced over to see if the three men were still following them and he was relieved to see that they're gone. \"They're gone.\" He breathed. \"Who the heck were those guys?! And what did they want with us ?\" \"How should I know?\" Moira said, shrugging her shoulders. \"But that was pretty crazy, wouldn't you say?\" \"I guess so… But it looks like Giselle's so-called 'prediction' already came true.\" \"What?\" \"You heard me. I know you've been expecting something to happen for these three days and now, something did happen. Now you can stop obsessing over it. End of story.\" \"I'm not obsessing over some stupid omen from some random cat box! I was trying to avoid it! I don't have time for nonsense!\" \"Nonsense?! No, you just don't have time for me ! I hardly spent any time with you, even at the park!\" \"All you've been doing was looking over my shoulder like a helicopter nanny! What kind of brother does that?!\" \"Well, what do you care about more: this omen or your family?\" \"You're being ridiculous!\" \"That's not an answer!\" \"Ugh, apparently this omen can't wait and you can!\" Peter stared at his eight year old sister, shocked and hurt. He felt his heart cracking as she glared up at him. A large black van suddenly drove by quick as lightning and it splashed the both of them in muddy rain water. They both grimaced. \"Aww, great. Let's get back to the house and dry off. Hopefully, mom and dad will help us sort this whole thing out.\" Peter grumbled before going down the sidewalk back to his grandparents' house; Moira said nothing and reluctantly followed him. When the duo made it back to the house however, they were shocked and horrified to see that one of the front windows was smashed. \"Peter, look at this!\" Moira exclaimed as she inspected the lock on the front door. \"The lock melted!\" \"How did it do that? It's not that hot out, is it?\" Peter questioned before gently pushing the door open. The siblings couldn't believe their eyes; the house was a total mess and no living soul was in sight. They gasped. \"Daddy!\" Moira cried, running into the house. \"Mom!\" Peter called, running after here. \"Grandma!\" \"Grandpa!\" \"Anyone?!\" No answer responded to them. \"This place is completely dead, no answer.\" Peter muttered, rubbing the back of his neck. \"No one's here!\" Moira exclaimed, nervously looking around. \"First, three guys tried to attack us, then we were chased out of the park by them, and now THIS?! This is bad, like REALLY BAD!\" \"Okay, calm down. Don't panic. I'm sure there's a logical explanation.\" Peter said, trying not to lose his cool around his sister. \"Maybe… maybe mom and grandma tore up the house looking for a coupon and then went shopping.\" Moira looked over at the garage and saw that the two cars were still parked in the driveway. \"Then why is grandma and grandpa's car still sitting the driveway?!\" She questioned. \"Uh… they walked?\" \"Don't be so naïve, Peter. No one else in the right mind would be out in that rain without a coat or an umbrella. Something is definitely wrong… and we're gonna find out what it is.\" \"Us?\" \"Yeah, us . I've read enough Sabrina Drake books to recognize a crime scene when I see one and this has burglary AND kidnapping written all over it.\" \"Well what do you suggest we do, Detective Frankenstein?\" \"What we need to do is split up and search each room of the house. For all we know, someone might still be here waiting for us. We also need to see if anything of value was taken, broken, or left untouched. Oh here, we can use these to communicate.\" Moira handed her brother a walk-e talk-e and she kept the other one for herself before grabbing a fire poker from the hearth and a wooden baseball bat. She gave her brother the poker while she kept the bat. \"We're gonna need these too, just in case.\" Moira said. Peter stared at his little sister in disbelief; he hadn't expected her to step up like this. \"O… okay, good plan.\" He said, looking at the poker nervously. \"Why don't I stay down here while you check the second floor? That way, we could cover more ground.\" \"Good idea. And be sure to radio me if you find anything.\" Moira said before running up the stairs; Peter looked up at the stairs before heading off in his own direction. Outside, Shamus Holmes and Dr. Watson arrived at the house and they saw the door wide open. \"We're too late.\" Holmes said as he approached the door, but then he spotted something on the porch. \"What is it, Holmes?\" Watson asked as his partner knelt down to get a closer look at what caught his eye. \"Footprints, Watson.\" Holmes replied, ushering the doctor to take a look as well. \"Let me guess: size 12, wide?\" \"Not even close. These footprints are far too small … and they appear to be fresh . One pair of prints is most likely from a sneaker or tennis shoe for boys and the other pair is from some kind of dress shoe for young girls. Someone else has come before us.\" \"…and maybe they're still here!\" \"Exactly! But there's only one way to find out.\" Inside the house, Peter and Moira were still searching; Peter was in the kitchen and living room while Moira started looking in the master bedroom. \"Have you found anything yet?\" Peter asked through his walk-e talk-e. \"No, not yet. You?\" Moira asked through her own walk-e talk-e. \"Nothing. But I have noticed that grandpa's cabinet of war medals is opened and empty.\" \"You mean they were stolen? All of them?\" \"Probably.\" \"Wait, now that you mention it, I just found grandma's jewelry box and that's empty, too. Every bit of jewelry she owns is GONE.\" \"Oh no. Okay, now I'm starting to…\" \"Hello! Is anyone in here?\" An unfamiliar voice called out; Peter and Moira froze. \"Oh my gosh, did you hear that?\" Moira said in a terrified whisper. \"How could I NOT?\" Peter replied in the same tone. \"I'm gonna go see who it is.\" \"Be careful.\" Peter snuck over and slowly peeked his head out from behind a wall; he saw two men he didn't recognize standing in the doorway, it was Shamus Holmes and Dr. Watson. When Holmes turned his head towards him, Peter quickly ducked away and hurriedly looked for a place to hide. \"There are two guys at the front door and they look awfully suspicious. I don't know who they are or what they're doing here and why, but it can't be for anything good.\" He whispered. \"So stay where you are.\" \"I'll try, but I need to keep looking for clues and so should you.\" Moira whispered back before heading into the master bedroom. \"Do you hear that, Watson?\" Holmes whispered, hearing the footsteps above him. \"Hear what?\" Watson asked. \"Very dainty footsteps, coming from the second floor.\" The two men froze when they heard a door slam shut; it was coming from the kitchen. \"Someone else is here, Holmes.\" Watson replied. \"And it's likely that there's more than one intruder. We need to split up.\" \"Split up? Oh, this is definitely the part of the horror movie where the sidekick gets it.\" \"How many times have I told you that you are not a sidekick? We're equals. Look, why don't you go upstairs while I stay down here?\" \"If you think it'd be best.\" Holmes stayed on the first floor while his partner made his way up. Holmes slowly made his way to where he thought the slam had come from, the kitchen. He adjusted his scarf and looked around with narrowed eyes. \"If there's anyone in here, just look out. I won't hurt you.\" He called out, keeping his cool. The kitchen was just as messy as the rest of the house; pots and pans were scattered on the floor, a few broken plates and cups were strewn about, and some red and yellow substance (most likely ketchup and mustard) stained the windows and countertop. \"Quite a struggle went on in here.\" He said to himself before he noticed more muddy prints on the floor; he knelt down for a closer look. \"More footprints… from the same sneaker.\" He then heard a creaking sound. Holmes slowly turned around to see the door to the pantry shut… but he didn't see Peter hiding inside. He could faintly hear breathing coming from the other side of the door. 'I am so dead.' Peter thought, trying to stay as quiet as possible. Holmes slyly smirked in the direction of the pantry. 'Hiding in the pantry? How foolishly naïve.' He thought, shaking his head and furrowing his brow. \"Hello? Is anybody up here?\" Watson called out as he cautiously walked through the second floor hallway. Moira was watching him from behind the master bedroom door. When he turned her way, she quickly ran out of sight. Watson went towards the door and looked into the room to see no one there, but he knew he heard something so he decided to search anyway. \"Are you hiding? I'm coming.\" He nervously called. What Watson failed to notice was a pair of anxious eyes watching him from underneath the bed; it was Moira. 'Good thing nobody looks under the bed.' She thought before two feet stopped right in front of her face; she froze. \"Is anyone here? Come out, come out wherever you are.\" Holmes taunted. \"Hmmm, no one's here. Perhaps they're hiding outside…\" When Peter heard the sound of footsteps walking away, he breathed a sigh of relief before he slowly opened the pantry door to take a tiny peek. \"Aha!\" Holmes yelled, jumping out from behind the counter. Peter screamed and tried to attack Holmes with his fire poker, but Holmes quickly dodged it, snatched the poker out of the boy's hands, and grabbed him by the shoulders. Peter kicked and screamed, struggling to get himself free from Holmes's surprisingly strong grasp. \"Hey! What are you doing?! Let me go!\" He yelled. \"Ugh, will you hold still?!\" Holmes demanded as he dragged his captive back to the front door. \"Hey, help! Help me!\" \"Peter?\" Moira said before two hands grabbed her by the arms and pulled her out from under the bed; she screamed as Watson lifted her up off the floor and threw her over his shoulder. \"What are you doing, you creep?! Put me down!\" Moira cried, trying to get herself free. \"You are coming with me.\" Watson said as he tried to ignore the tiny fists pounding on his back. Holmes and Watson met up in the living room and they each plopped their captives down onto the sofa. The four of them stared at each other with wide eyes; Holmes certainly wasn't expecting to find children here.[Chapter 6] \"…They're only children .\" Watson said. \"Yes, I can see that . Who are you and what are you two doing here? This is an active crime scene.\" Holmes inquired as he lowered his head down to look the young duo in the eye. \"No. Who are you and what are you two doing here? This is private property.\" Moira snapped as she pushed Holmes away. \"Yeah, our grandparents do NOT appreciate trespassers.\" Peter retorted, crossing his arms over his chest. \"Your grandparents ? You're related to Jonathon and Lydia Van Helsing?\" Watson asked with wide eyes. \"Yeah. We're supposed to be here on vacation with our mommy and daddy, who also happen to be missing.\" Moira answered. \"Your parents? …You two are American?\" Holmes asked. \"So what if we are?\" Peter asked. \"Hold on, where were you when this crime was committed?\" Watson asked. Peter and Moira opened their mouths to speak, only to be stopped by Holmes letting out an annoyed sigh. \"Is it not obvious? They were having a siblings' quarrel.\" He explained. \"See how they're facing away from each other? They're angry with one another; about what, I don't know. Most likely about something small, insignificant, and petty. And judging by their mud-coated clothes and wet hair, they were just out in the rain. And…\" \"Whoa, hey!\" Moira cried as Holmes grabbed her foot and examined it. \"…the fresh mud staining their shoes indicates that they are the owners of the smaller prints we've discovered on the porch AND they've just returned from the local park which is three blocks away from this house because of the visible blades of grass stuck between the shoe patterns. And the way that they were hiding from us with little radios and weapons in hand, they were searching the house for any form of threat.\" He let go of the little girl's foot. \"…How did you know all that? You speak as if you were just there.\" Peter said with a confused look. \"Never mind that. Watson, we need to properly search the house, without any distractions. Look in the dining room and kitchen while I check the living room.\" Holmes said to his partner before taking another look around the house. \"If that fiend really is behind this, then he will have left his calling card.\" \"Calling card?\" Moira asked aloud, looking at Peter who gave her a confused shrug. \"Yes. It's the size of a normal playing card, it's royal blue, and there's a large golden 'M' printed on it.\" Watson explained, not turning around to look at the children. \"What are you doing? Don't tell them that.\" Holmes hissed through gritted teeth. \"You mean… like this?\" Moira stood up from the sofa and held up a card that fit the doctor's description perfectly. Holmes turned his head and gasped in shock the moment he saw the card. He quickly strode over to the little girl. \"Where did you get that?\" \"I found it in the master bedroom. It was taped to the mirror on my grandma's dresser.\" Moira replied. \"…Let me see that.\" She was about to give the card to him when Peter stood and placed a hand in front of her, blocking her way from Holmes or as if protecting his little sister from this mysterious stranger. \"Tell us what it is first.\" He said, furrowing his brow suspiciously. \"…It's a clue.\" Holmes replied, sounding slightly peeved. \"It will lead us to our next destination. And if you ever want to see your family again, you will behave and hand it over.\" He held out his hand and wagged his fingers at the little girl, nonverbally demanding her to give him the card. Moira looked at Peter who had an uneasy look on his face; he shrugged at her. She looked at the card in her hand, then at the two men; she got an idea. \"Okay, I'll give it to you.\" She said. Watson smiled and approached the two children. \"Ah, there's a good girl. Glad to see someone here is listening to reason.\" \"Hold it.\" Holmes said as he put his arm in front of his partner to stop him. \"I'll give it to you… on one condition.\" Moira said, giving the card to her brother. Watson's expression changed from satisfied to surprised when he looked at his partner who removed his arm and shook his head at him. \"I knew it; there's always a catch… What do you want? A puppy, a kitten?\" Holmes asked, folding his arms and looking back at the little girl. \"No. If I give you this card…\" Moira began in a sly tone. \"…you and your friend have to allow me and my brother to come along on this investigation AND allow us to help you look for more clues.\" \"What?\" Peter and Watson asked. \"WHAT?!\" Holmes exclaimed. \"Are you out of your mind, child? Isn't there anything else you want?\" \"Either you let us tag along or no deal.\" Moira said, turning her back to the two detectives who were left in shock; neither Holmes nor Watson had expected this young stranger to act so precocious and cunning, especially for a child at her age. \"Uh, could you excuse us for a minute, gentlemen?\" Peter nervously chuckled before pulling Moira to the side. \"What are you doing?\" Moira asked in a whisper. \"Moira, are you crazy?!\" Peter quietly screamed. \"You can't make a deal like that! These guys just broke into grandma and grandpa's house and manhandled and questioned us! I don't trust them and neither should you. Who knows what they're really up to?\" \"Ugh! I know the Stranger Danger rules, Peter, but it looks like these guys are all we've got right now.\" Moira replied. \"Besides, we could really use a friend or two out here. And it looks like they have a pretty good idea of what they're doing.\" \"Friends? These guys are so much older than us! Probably the same age as mom and dad.\" \"So what?! Age is just a number!\" \"No, it's not!\" Holmes and Watson looked at the two children whispering amongst themselves, wondering what they might be talking about. Then Holmes spotted the card in Peter's hand; thinking fast, he reached out and snatched the card out of the boy's hand. \"Wha—H-hey!\" Peter cried. \"What are you doing?! Give that back!\" Moira yelled, trying to grab the card from Holmes, who ignored her. \"Hmmm, the letter 'Z'… with a slight crack in its lower leg.\" Holmes said, inspecting the card; there was a photograph of the letter 'Z' taped to the back of it. \"Where have I seen this particular 'Z' before?\" Holmes gripped his forehead and shut his eyes as if lost in thought or his mind had gone off into the clouds. Peter and Moira stared uncomfortably at the detective for a minute or two. \"Uh… he does know that we can't see what he's thinking, right?\" Peter asked, glancing at Watson. \"Hush, he's concentrating.\" Watson replied. \"Concentrating on what ?\" Moira asked. Before Watson could answer however, Holmes suddenly snapped back to reality and triumphantly announced, \"Aha, I've got it! To Chinatown, Watson! The game is afoot!\" Holmes placed the card into his coat pocket and headed towards the door with Watson right behind him, only to be stopped by Peter and Moira. The two of them blocked the doorway and glared up at the men before them. \"What are you doing?!\" Watson exclaimed. \"You're not going anywhere! Tell us what you know!\" Peter said. \"Ugh, we don't have time for this! Would you two please step aside?\" Holmes demanded. \"Not until you tell us what's going on! Besides, we had a deal!\" Moira reminded him. \"Ah, ah, ah; no, we didn't. You never gave me the card; I simply took it from your brother while you were speaking amongst yourselves. So technically, there was no deal to agree to.\" Holmes retorted before hearing something else. \"That's not fair! You can't just—\" Moira started before Holmes shushed her. \"Hey, did you just shush me?!\" He shushed her again. \"Okay, now that is just ru—\" \"Quiet! I heard something.\" Holmes hissed, covering Moira's mouth with his hand; Peter was about to open his mouth to speak when he heard it. The group of four froze when they all heard the back door slowly open, then close. Holmes's eyes widened when he saw three large shadows slowly approaching the front room. \"Oh no. They're coming for us…\" Watson whispered. \"Say what now?\" Peter asked with wide eyes. \"Ugh, perfect. And now we need to run, thanks to these meddlesome, immature Yanks.\" Holmes said before grabbing Moira's forearm and running out the door, pulling her along with him; Watson and Peter quickly ran out after them. \"Hey, why are we running? What's going on now ?\" Moira asked as Holmes kept a tight grip on her arm. \"I'll explain later. For now, just keep going!\" Holmes replied as he continued to run. Moira and Peter had no idea who or what they were trying to get away from, but they knew it couldn't be good and they didn't want to get on Holmes's bad side so they kept running. \"We need to throw them off of our trail!\" Watson said. Moira then spotted two motor bikes sitting on the curb ahead of them; she pointed a finger at them and said, \"Hey, what about those motorcycles?\" \"Good idea! We can use them to make a quicker escape!\" Watson replied. They all ran over to the bikes and got on as fast as they could; luckily the owners of the bikes had left their keys in the ignition. \"Wait, what if we get in trouble?! Aren't we technically stealing these bikes?\" Peter questioned, climbing onto the bike behind Watson. \"We're commandeering these motorbikes, young man. Besides, no one is using them.\" Holmes said as he lifted Moira off of the ground and sat her down behind him. \"And don't worry, leave everything to us.\" \"They're catching up!\" Moira said, pointing a finger at their pursuers; she recognized them as the three same men who chased her and Peter out of the park before. Holmes, Watson, Peter and Moira each put on a helmet; Holmes and Watson started the bikes and with that, they sped away from the sidewalk and down the road at top speed just as the three men almost reached them. \"Oh, those brats got away.\" One man said. \"I know. And Holmes and Watson are protecting them.\" Another man added. \"Don't worry; we'll get them, somehow.\" The third man replied, glaring at the motor bikes disappearing into the distance. \"Whoa! You guys are AWESOME!\" Peter exclaimed. \"Thank you!\" Watson answered. \"Hey, I thought you said you didn't trust these guys!\" Moira called smugly. \"There's no time for 'chit-chat', as you would say. We need to find somewhere safe!\" Holmes said, scanning the area for a place to turn. \"That way, turn right!\" Peter said, pointing his finger at a dirt road to the right; Holmes made a hard right turn for it with Watson following suit. They rode down the foggy dirt roads until they came to a tiny abandoned churchyard. The group of four leapt off of the bikes and ran straight into the church, shutting the doors behind them. They were all breathing heavily. \"That was a close one.\" Watson panted. \"You okay?\" Peter asked his sister. \"Uh-huh. Whew.\" She said before turning her head to look up at Holmes with a smug look on her face. \"You said something about 'meddlesome, immature Yanks'?\" \"Well, I still… stand by that assessment. But I… must admit, you two are rather resourceful, especially for your young age.\" Holmes admitted. \"I'll take that as a compliment.\" Moira said; Peter nodded. \"You should . He rarely gives them to strangers.\" Watson said. \"Now, um… what did you say your names were?\" Holmes asked. \"We didn't.\" Peter said huffily. \"I'm Peter.\" \"And I'm his sister, Moira.\" Moira added. \"Peter and Moira… interesting names for American youths.\" Holmes said. \"And you are…?\" Moira inquired. \"Oh, yes of course. I am Shamus Holmes and this is my friend and partner in crime-solving, Dr. Joseph Watson.\" Holmes introduced himself and Watson. \"How do you do.\" Watson greeted. \"Hello.\" Peter said. 'Crime-solving? Are they… who I think they are?' A thought suddenly popped into Moira's head; she asked, \"Uh, this is probably gonna sound silly but… are you guys real detectives ?\" \"London's finest, my dear.\" Holmes answered proudly. \"Though I am what others would consider a consulting detective, the first and only one of my kind.\" Watson shook his head and smirked. The little girl's eyes widened; she had always wanted to meet real live detectives and until now, she thought she never would. \"Um… is she okay?\" Watson asked, facing Peter. \"Oh yeah, she's fine. She's just always wanted to meet detectives in real life and not just in her dreams.\" Peter replied; he gently shook her shoulder to snap her back to reality. \"…Never mind that. This way, Watson; we need to hurry.\" Holmes said, heading towards the door; Moira quickly stepped in front of him. \"Hold up, hold up! You're not going anywhere, mister.\" She said, staring daggers up at him. \"Not until you let me and Peter join you and Dr. Watson.\" \"Child, you can't be serious about this!\" Holmes said in exasperation; her glare didn't falter. \"Watson and I are investigators , not nannies ! We cannot be the ones to look after you!\" \"Well, what other choice do you have?\" Moira asked, putting her hands on her hips. \"She's right, you know. There's nowhere else for the two of us to go.\" Peter added. \"Besides, we can be a real asset to the team.\" \"Oh really? How so?\" Holmes asked; he didn't believe a word of what the two children were saying. \"I'm pretty handy with tools.\" Peter said. \"And I've read more mystery stories than you can probably even count on your hands.\" Moira added; Holmes sighed in frustration. \"You can read every book and magazine about music in the world, but that does not make you a professional cellist or even a rock star. You can say whatever you like, but my answer is still 'NO'. You're not coming with us and that's final !\" He said sternly. \"And there's nothing either of you can say or do that will change my mind.\" Moira looked over at Peter who gave her a somewhat nod of approval; she nodded back. \"What?\" Watson asked. \"Mr. Holmes? I think you'd better go back on your word and let me and my sister come along on this case or else.\" Peter said slyly, walking over to Holmes. \"Or else what ?\" Holmes asked, looking at Peter. \"Or else we'll have to break out the secret weapon.\" The two siblings smirked and nodded at each other again; Holmes quickly understood what they were going to do. \"I don't like where this is going.\" He muttered. \"Oh, you know exactly where this is going.\" Moira said. \"No, don't. Please, no.\" \"I'm gonna do it.\" \"Please, don't do this.\" \"I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.\" \"No, no, no, no. Don't you dare, don't you DARE!\" \"I'm gonna do it.\" \"No, I swear! Please, don't!\" \"I'm gonna do it! I'll do it!\" \"I pray!\" \"PLEEEEEEEEASE?\" It was then that Moira made the saddest, most innocent looking face she could muster; Peter smirked and chuckled as Watson and Holmes attempted to shield their eyes. \"You might as well give in, gentlemen.\" He said slyly. \"Shield your eyes, Watson! It's a trick!\" Holmes exclaimed. \"Save your breath; no one can resist those eyes. I know, people tried.\" This standoff lasted a good minute or two until finally, Holmes couldn't take it anymore. \"Okay, okay, okay FINE! I give up, you win! You two can come! AND you can help us look for clues! Just PLEASE tell your sister to turn off those puppy-dog eyes this instant ! PLEASE, I beg you! Make it stop!\" He screamed in defeat. \"What?!\" Watson cried out. \"Yes! Whoo!\" Moira exclaimed as her eyes reverted back to normal; she looked at Peter. \"Nice call; works every time.\" Watson and Holmes stared at the two children with wide eyes and looks of shock on their faces; they really underestimated these kids. \"What. Just. Happened?\" Watson asked. \"She broke me. An eight year old American girl broke me.\" Holmes said, sounding very disappointed in himself; he ran a hand through his hair and let out a sigh. \"Okay. Now that that's settled and now that we're on the team, how about one of you tells us what's going on? Starting with this?\" Peter asked, taking the card with the 'M' from Watson. \"Of course; you have a right to know. The 'M' stands for Moriarty, Holmes's archenemy as well as the greatest criminal mastermind in all of London.\" Watson explained as Peter and Moira listened intently. \"Some men are just born evil and Professor Nigel Moriarty was the most evil of them all. For years, Moriarty would plan and execute the nastiest, the most sinister, and sometimes the most unsolvable crimes and cases ever committed by mankind, bringing London to its knees… until he met his match in Shamus Holmes. When he and I solved one of Moriarty's heinous crimes about fourteen years back, Moriarty was both shocked and impressed now that he had a worthy opponent… and beating Shamus became his obsession. So he began to play his terrible game. This professor was very crafty, just as intelligent and clever as Holmes; Moriarty would plan everything down to the smallest little detail, just to be sure every part of every single one of his plans were fool proof. And we believe that he is the one behind the recent burglaries and kidnappings around the city; this card is all the proof we need.\" \"Burglaries?!\" Peter asked. \"Kidnappings?!\" Moira added. \"Yes.\" Watson answered before continuing. \"We don't know why Moriarty has targeted your family or any of these other people specifically, but we do know that it's for something truly diabolical. The last time Holmes and I faced Moriarty together was at the London National Gallery; Moriarty had planned on stealing every painting he could get his hands on and selling them to the highest bidder on the black market. But luckily, we stopped him just in time. When we caught him, the Inspector had come to arrest him… but Moriarty already got away. That was several months ago.\" \"So… what kinda game does this Moriarty guy play, exactly?\" Peter asked. \"You see, he would carry out a scheme mostly a robbery; he would leave a trail of clues that would lead to his location for me and Holmes to find and challenge us to a battle of wits. We'll need to find him within the next twenty-four hours or so.\" \"But what happens if you don't find him before your time is up?\" Moira asked. \"…I don't know. Holmes and I have always beaten Moriarty before then. But this is different from the other times; Moriarty has never done a mass kidnapping like this before and we can only assume that if we don't find him AND the missing citizens by midnight tomorrow, then… he would most likely kill them all if he doesn't get what he wants.\" \"What?!\" The siblings cried. \"This guy gonna kill our family?! He's insane!\" Peter gasped. \"How do we stop him?!\" Moira asked. \"We play his game.\" Holmes answered as he opened the church doors. \"For now, we follow the trail of clues and we'll find him and his captives before the twenty-four hours are up. Now let's go. We need to head over to Chinatown; that's where the first clue is leading us. And now that you're officially on the team, you, Peter and Moira, are going to help us in any way you can… whether you like it or not.\" Peter and Moira looked at each other with wide eyes; this simple vacation just got a little more intense.[Chapter 7] By the time the group of four had arrived, the sky was already dark. Holmes and Watson were awed by the sight before them, but Peter and Moira were another story. Their eyes grew larger with every second of what they witnessed. A painted metal gate with a green roof decorated with fire-breathing dragons rose above them. Strings of Chinese and British flags crisscrossed the brick row houses and buildings that lined the street on both sides. The Chinese restaurants served the most delicious foods to their hungry customers. Strings of glowing Chinese paper lanterns lined the street beautifully. A few Chinese acrobats performed daring and incredible tricks on the street, impressing the crowds of onlookers. A few window shops displayed alluring Chinese art, fashion, and cute toys. \"Whoa! THIS is Chinatown?\" Peter asked in awe. \"Yes.\" Watson answered, nodding his head. \"It's so pretty here.\" Moira commented. \"I suppose it is, but we're not here to play tourist.\" Holmes said, taking the little girl by the hand and leading her over to the sidewalk and into a nearby alleyway. \"We'll need to go undercover.\" \"Undercover? Where are we going?\" Peter asked. \"To Madame Zhen's South Shore Grill and Gift Shoppe, right across the street.\" Holmes replied before spotting an old box; he ran over to it and started to dig through it. \"Um, Holmes? If you recall the last time we were here, it was a bit of a disaster.\" Watson quietly and nervously reminded his friend. \"Yes, I faintly remember running into a slight casualty or two. But we mustn't focus on that or let fear cloud our minds, Watson. There are no shortcuts in this game.\" Holmes said, not turning around as he continued to rummage. \"Why not?\" Moira asked. \"Because if we do anything that will break the rules of Moriarty's sick game, then… something bad will most definitely happen. So we cannot take any fatal risks; we cannot cheat.\" Holmes replied, frowning. Watson, Peter, and Moira nodded. Holmes then tossed a few pieces of old Chinese styled clothing and accessories to the others. \"Mr. Holmes? What are you doing?\" Peter asked. \"What are these for?\" Moira asked, holding up what looked like a silken coat with a hood. \"We'll need to put these disguises on so we don't get spotted the restaurant staff.\" Holmes instructed as he put on a long trench coat with a hood and a surgical mask. \"What's with the surgical mask, Mr. Holmes?\" Moira asked as she put on the little happy coat. \"You do realize that Kuchisake-Onna is a Japanese legend, not Chinese right?\" Holmes paused; he turned to look at Moira and asked her, \"How do you know of the Slit-Mouthed Woman?\" \"My friend Shelley Sue told me the legend once.\" She replied. \"…The surgical mask is for another purpose.\" Holmes hesitantly replied. \"Once we're inside, we'll need to act natural and try not to draw any unwanted attention. The next clue is most likely somewhere in the gift shop, which is right next to the restaurant. So we'll need to be extra careful. Ready? Let's go.\" Once everyone was in costume, the group of four ran across the street as quickly and carefully as possible and entered the restaurant. It was a bustling area packed with customers patiently waiting for their dinner and employees rushing around preparing and delivering platters of food. \"Wow, this place smells amazing .\" Peter said as the smell of cooking and spices filled his nose. \"Shush, focus.\" Moira hissed. \"There, you see? We're blending in perfectly.\" Holmes whispered. \"Just stay close and we'll be fine.\" Watson added. As the group of four maneuvered their way around the crowds waiting for available tables, a small round man had spotted them and rushed off towards the kitchen to report their presence to his boss. A loud gong sounded. An ensemble of waiters and waitresses appeared from the kitchen doors and they surrounded the group. \"Holmes? I'm pretty sure we've been spotted.\" Watson whispered to the other; Holmes nodded in response. A pair of waiters stepped aside and an elderly Chinese couple suddenly emerged. Holmes and Watson bowed before them as if they were royalty; Moira and Peter followed suit. \"Stand up, all of you.\" The man said; the group obeyed. \"Good evening, Madame Zhen. To you as well, Fang.\" Holmes politely said, trying not to sound too nervous. The woman glared at Holmes with beady eyes and said to him, \"Hello, Shamus Holmes. What brings you and Dr. Watson here this evening? Surely you have not come for dinner.\" \"We're… here on a case.\" Holmes replied. The man, possibly Fang, glanced over to see Peter and Moira huddled together behind Holmes and his eyes widened. \"You bring CHILDREN on a case?\" He asked. Holmes turned around to see his younger companions giving him nervous looks; he turned to Fang with a raised eyebrow. \"Is there a problem?\" He asked. \"You never bring children on your investigations.\" \"Well, this time is different . Watson and I are helping them find their family… as well as keeping an eye on them both.\" Peter and Moira grinned nervously as Holmes glanced over his shoulder at them with a frown in his eyes. \"Oh, I see you received the orchid we sent to apologize for our last encounter.\" Watson commented, glancing up at a potted orchid sitting on a shelf close by; he was hoping to change the subject. \"Yes, a gracious gift. But that is still no excuse for what you have done.\" Zhen said bitterly. \"The two of you have caused absolute CHAOS the last time you were here! You were chasing my beloved cat all over my restaurant! You nearly ruined my establishment and my reputation!\" \"Say what now?\" Peter mumbled to Watson. \"I haven't the slightest idea of what you're talking about.\" Holmes said, attempting to sound innocent. \"You rudely called Zhen a fat, disgusting old prune and then you threatened her and her cat with a pasta strainer.\" Watson commented before Holmes elbowed him in the ribs. \"I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.\" He hissed; Moira and Peter snickered under their breath. \"Silence!\" Fang yelled. As the adults continued to argue, Moira glanced around the restaurant and she soon noticed a curtain with a sign written in Chinese taped to it in one corner. 'That must lead to the gift shop.' She thought before she had an idea. She folded the fan in her hand, dropped it onto the floor, and said, \"Whoops, dropped my fan.\" She quickly knelt down to grab it; the grownups paid no notice however. As they talked, Moira quietly crawled away from the group and headed towards the curtain. She read the sign; luckily it had an English translation underneath. It read: \"Door broken. Gift Shoppe closed for renovation\" . She frowned, but then she saw a little white cat emerge from under the curtain and trotted over to Zhen. Moira removed the fabric and saw that there was no door; thinking fast, she quickly and quietly zipped into the gift shop without anyone noticing. \"And another thing!\" Fang said before noticing that Moira wasn't with them. \"Wait, where is that little girl that was just with you?\" \"What do you mean?\" Watson asked. \"I mean that girl in the black happy coat; she is not here.\" Fang replied. Peter looked around and saw that he was right; his little sister was nowhere in sight and he started to panic. \"Uh guys? He's right; Moira's gone.\" He said nervously; Holmes eyes widened in shock. \"Would you all excuse us for a moment?\" He said before pulling Watson and Peter into a huddle; he glared at Pater. \"Where is she?!\" \"I don't know!\" Peter hissed. \"I thought you were supposed to keep an eye on her; you are her older brother.\" \"I thought you were supposed to know everything , Mr. All-Knowing Detective.\" \"Don't be ridiculous. If I did know everything, my head would physically be much bigger.\" \"Enough! Moira must be around here somewhere. And she couldn't have gone too far.\" Watson said before noticing the curtain. \"What if she went into the gift shop while we were talking?\" \"She must've; I don't see her anywhere else. I must say, Peter; your little sister is much sneakier than I thought.\" Holmes said before he thought of a plan. \"I know! I'll go and find her while you two create a distraction.\" \"You want me ? To distract these guys? How do we do that?\" Peter nervously asked before Holmes broke the huddle. \"Oh, the little girl in the black happy coat! Yes! Yes, I'm sure little Moira has simply… wandered off just to find the loo or a drinking fountain. That's all.\" Holmes lied, facing Zhen and Fang. \"She's probably lost, the poor little dear; I'll go look for her right now. Be back in a tick.\" Holmes quickly ran off, leaving Watson and Peter alone with Zhen, Fang, and the rest of the restaurant employees and attendees. \"Uh… who here like showtunes?!\" Peter exclaimed in a panic. \" Showtunes ?\" Watson hissed. \"Just follow my lead. I saw this in a cartoon once.\" Everyone thought that Holmes had made his way over to a restroom but when no one was looking, he quickly made his way to the curtain leading to the gift shop. He looked around, only to find a black happy coat and a fan on the floor at his feet. 'She's still here.' He thought. \"Moira? Moira, where are you?!\" He quietly called out. \"Over here!\" Moira's voice replied. Moira poked her head out from behind the counter in one corner of the room; Holmes made his way over to her and glared at her. \"What?\" She asked, shrugging her shoulders innocently. \"Do NOT run off like that again.\" Holmes said as he grabbed her by the waist and lifted her over the counter. \"Hey, where are Peter and Dr. Watson?\" \"They're creating a diversion back in the restaurant.\" They suddenly heard loud music coming from outside; Moira and Holmes slowly peeked out from behind the curtain to see Peter and Watson standing on a table, singing and dancing the Macarena with everyone watching. Moira's eyes widened. \"What the what is that…?\" She questioned in a whisper. \"…Their idea of a diversion, I believe.\" Holmes replied before shaking his head and closing the curtain. \"Never mind that. We need to focus.\" \"Yeah, you're right. So what are we supposed to be looking for?\" Moira asked as she turned her attention away from the strange sight. \"I'm not sure. But keep your eyes open for anything that looks out of place; that could be the clue we need.\" \"Out of place, got it.\" The pair of them thoroughly scanned and searched the entire shop, trying to find the next clue Moriarty had left for them. As she gazed up, Moira suddenly spotted a cuckoo clock hanging on the wall above the second door on the other end of the store. \"What about that?\" She said, pointing up at the clock. \"Good eyes. That shouldn't be here; a clock is a VERY insulting and offensive gift in Chinese culture.\" Holmes said before running over to it… only to realize that it was too high to reach, even for him. \"Oh bother, too high. What to do? Maybe I could climb onto a table or use a footstool, or…\" Holmes suddenly got an idea; he glanced over at Moira. \"Moira, dearie, would you do me a favor… and climb onto my shoulders?\" He asked, kneeling before her. \"Wait, what?\" She said before realizing what he wanted her to do. \"Oh! Okay, I'll do it. Just hold still when I get up there.\" And with that, the little girl carefully made her way onto Holmes's broad shoulders and she was so high up that she was face to face with the cuckoo clock. \"What do you want me to do?\" She asked. \"You'll need to turn the little key on your right side three times and set the hands to exactly 8:00.\" Holmes replied, trying to keep his balance. Moira nodded, turned a little key on the side of the timepiece, and carefully moved the hour hand in a clockwise direction until the clock itself read eight o'clock. The doors suddenly sprang open, momentarily startling her. But instead of a birdie, a paper airplane with an 'M' card taped to one of its wings flew out; Moira quickly reached out and grabbed it. \"I got it!\" She said. \"Good job. Whoa!\" Holmes said before he stepped down on a stray piece of paper, which caused him to slip and begin to lose his balance. \"Oh no! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Steady, keep steady!\" Moira said nervously. \"I'm trying.\" \"Try harder.\" \"Uh oh.\" \"Don't tell me; we're about to fall onto something big, fragile, and expensive.\" \"…Most likely. Brace yourself!\" In the restaurant, as Watson and Peter were still singing, two screams followed by a loud crash were heard; everyone turned and saw that it was coming from the gift shop. Peter looked at Watson nervously. \"Did Mr. Holmes find Moira or did they find the clue?\" He asked. \"Knowing Shamus, most likely both.\" Watson replied before taking Peter by the arm. \"Uh, I think it's about time to go before we make another scene.\" Peter nodded before he and Watson jumped off of the table and headed towards the door. Back in the gift shop, Moira and Holmes had fallen onto a display of silken scarves, fans, and other accessories. They were very dizzy, but luckily they weren't hurt. \"That could've gone a lot smoother…\" Moira said with a straw umbrella on her head. Holmes removed a silken coat from his face, shook his head, and said as he sat up, \"Did you… get the clue?\" \"Yep.\" Moira replied as she held up the paper plane and sat up. \"But I have no idea what it means.\" \"Let me have a look.\" Holmes said before the little girl gave him the clue; he thoroughly inspected it, trying figure out what it could mean. \"Hmmm, a paper plane; how cryptic. Ooh, classic Moriarty.\" \"Classic? What do you mean 'classic'? Can I have another look at that?\" Moira asked before Holmes stopped her. \"Moira, please; you must trust me. My methods may be rather strange and unconventional, but I will find your family. I promise.\" He told her. \"What is going on in here?!\" Zhen's voice screamed as she barged into the shop with her husband and a few burly security guards; Holmes and Moira froze. \"Uh oh…\" Moira muttered. \"Causing trouble again , I see?\" Fang said. \"Well, at least we found what we were looking for.\" Holmes whispered. Moira glanced over to her right and saw Watson and Peter on the other side of the window who were telling them to run for it. She took Holmes's hand in her own as they stood up from the wreckage they made. \"Uh… Thanks so much for having us, but I think it's about time Mr. Holmes and I make like a couple of ghosts and disappear!\" She said before running out the second door with Holmes right behind her. \"After them!\" Zhen commanded. \"This way! Hurry!\" Holmes yelled as he ran to his left. The group of four ran down the sidewalk with the restaurant employees and the security guards chasing after them. Peter glanced around and noticed a nearby fire escape on the side of one of the buildings. \"Up there!\" He said, gesturing towards the fire escape. They hurriedly climbed up the metal ladders and stairs and once they reached the top, they ran across the rooftops, unsure if they were still being followed. But they soon reached a dead end; they were trapped. Holmes looked down and noticed the top of a large tent at the bottom; he had a crazy idea. \"Follow my lead, everyone. We only have one go at this.\" He said as he turned around with his back facing the edge. \"Wait, what are we doing?\" Moira asked nervously. Holmes smirked. \"Jumping, of course.\" And with that, he took a casual step backwards and fell off of the roof. Everyone gasped in shock and they ran to the ledge to see what has become of the detective. Looking down, they saw that Holmes had safely landed on the tent's roof and slid down to the ground. Everyone else reluctantly imitated his actions; Peter and Moira screamed and shut their eyes as they fell before they too had landed without a scratch. \"Mr. Holmes? Is this sort of thing normal for you and Dr. Watson?\" Moira asked. \"It all depends on what you mean by 'normal'. Quick, get onto that bus!\" Holmes replied before running towards a bus that was about to drive off in a few minutes. They all ran onto the bus as fast as they could and seated themselves just as the bus was driving off, leaving the angry couple and their workers behind. \"Have you solved the clue yet, Mr. Holmes? Where are we going next?\" Peter asked. \"Patience, Peter. Just hold on.\" Holmes replied, staring at the clue in his hand. He carefully unfolded the plane to reveal that it was a London tourist pamphlet.[Chapter 8] \"This is our stop.\" Holmes said as he reached up and pulled a cord from the ceiling, signaling the bus to stop. The group of four exited the bus and ran down the sidewalk as the vehicle departed the bus station. Holmes made a hard right turn and ran towards a large stone building; he and the others suddenly jumped into the bushes so nobody would see them. Holmes peeked his head out and saw that no one was following them; he gave sigh of relief and turned to look back at everybody else. \"Is everyone alright?\" He asked. \"I'm fine.\" Watson replied. \"All good.\" Peter commented. \"Me too.\" Moira added before looking up at the building in front of them. \"Where are we?\" \"That is the Natural History Museum.\" Holmes replied. \"Of course! This must be where the clue is leading us. Right, Holmes?\" Watson deducted. \"Nonsense, Watson. Moriarty would NEVER choose a location as obvious as this.\" Holmes scoffed. \"Remember, this is a battle of wits . We'll need to think VERY hard, all of us.\" \"I guess it would make sense.\" Moira commented; Holmes turned his head in her direction. \"Clues as vague as the one we've just found could mean one thing, and yet it could something entirely different . There's always a deeper meaning.\" \"…Couldn't have said it better myself.\" Holmes said. \"Okay, so what's your plan, Mr. Smarty Pants?\" Peter asked the detective. \"Well, if you must know… we're going to the White Rose Concert Hall. I haven't cracked the clue yet, and the music helps me ruminate.\" Holmes pointed a finger at the opera house a short distance away from the museum. \"Seriously? THAT'S your plan?! Music and thinking?\" Peter exclaimed in frustration. \"Yes. Deciphering clues takes time; you must be patient.\" \"I have been patient! Heck, I've been patient all day and I have a feeling we're not getting any closer to finding mom and dad!\" \"Don't be absurd, of course we are. We're just taking a detour.\" \"I thought you said there were no detours.\" \"No, I said that there are no shortcuts . We can't cheat.\" \"But we should check out the museum, at least. C'mon, think about it. Didn't you guys beat Moriarty in a museum once?\" \"Yes, but this isn't the same museum.\" Watson commented. \"Okay, whatever. But that paper plane is a tourist pamphlet and there are PLENTY of other pamphlets in a museum like this, so maybe… Wait, are you even listening to me? He's not listening, look at him!\" Peter was right; Holmes wasn't paying any attention to him. His eyes were glazed over as he went off into his imagination. Watson, Moira, and Peter didn't know what he was thinking, but the expression on his face told everyone that whatever he was thinking about must be very strange. Peter had enough of Holmes ignoring him and the boy gave the detective a good old smack in the arm and yelled, \"Snap out of it!\" \"…Don't you ever smack me again.\" Holmes said, glowering at the boy and rubbing his sore arm. \"Well, forget you! Forget the rules ! And forget the game !\" Peter yelled. \"Good luck with your music and thinking and junk. I'm going to check the museum whether you like it or not! Let's go, sis. We can find our own way around here… Come on, Moira. I said we're leaving .\" \"…Maybe we should just go to the Concert Hall.\" Moira said as she took a step closer to Holmes. \"What, seriously?! You're choosing this guy over me ?! A total stranger over your own brother?!\" Peter cried in disbelief. \"I'm not choosing anybody. Mr. Holmes knows this Moriarty person and you don't.\" Moira retorted. \"I thought we were supposed to be a team. Peter and Moira Frankenstein, remember?\" 'Did he just say Frankenstein ?' Holmes thought, looking back at the two children with wide eyes. \"We are a team!\" Moira insisted. \"Well, it doesn't feel like it. And it hasn't felt like it since we got here! Are you with me or not?\" Peter offered his hand to Moira, hoping she would take it. Moira glanced at his hand, but she didn't even bother to touch it; she took another step back. \" Please don't do this.\" She made it clear that she was staying with Holmes. There was a moment of silence. \"I knew it.\" Peter said heavily. \"I knew it! This is all because of that stupid cat box omen and what Giselle said! Ugh, I can't believe it!\" \"Cat box omen?\" Watson asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Who is Giselle?\" Holmes questioned, shrugging his shoulders. \"I told you NO! I'm just trying to be responsible here!\" Moira argued \"And you think I'm not? I just want to protect you!\" \"Well, I don't need anyone protecting me! I can handle things myself! And, and… and I don't need you , you stubborn, reckless, bullheaded blowhard!\" Peter glowered at his sister. \"Oh yeah? Well, I don't need you , you bossy, annoying, selfish brat!\" He yelled before he violently shoved her to the ground, causing her to land on her backside. Holmes knelt down to help Moira get back onto her feet; Peter gave his sister a hurt look before running off towards the museum. \"N-no, Peter wait! I…\" Moira called, but he didn't hear her nor did he care to listen. He was already in the museum before anyone else could stop him. \"Should we go after him?\" Watson asked. \"Perhaps only one of us should go…\" Holmes replied. \" I'll go.\" Moira said before she felt someone grab her hand and pull her back. \"No. I doubt he'll want to talk to you right now, considering… what just happened.\" Holmes said hesitantly. \"Oh. Yeah…\" She sighed. \"Don't worry. I'll get him back and I'll talk to him.\" Watson said to Moira. \"Just be careful, Watson.\" Holmes said. \"Of course.\" And Watson made his way to the museum just as carefully as Peter had done, leaving Moira alone with Holmes. Holmes started to slowly walk away with Moira following close behind, the detective kept his grip on her small hand. The little girl kept quiet, she couldn't stop thinking about what Peter had said to her. Holmes paused before saying, \"You're concerned about your brother.\" Moira looked up in surprise. \"Is it that obvious?\" \"I could tell by your lack of vocals and your current body language… but don't worry. Watson will find him and everything will be okay.\" \"It's not that. I just… can't stop thinking about what he said. We are supposed to be a team, and I haven't really been listening to him lately…\" \"I understand, but you shouldn't be worried. Everyone fights with their siblings sometimes; most siblings just do it more than others… like me and my two older sisters.\" \"But… that's like the first time I've ever really fought with Peter . He and I have always been so close, ever since we were little… I feel horrible. Why did I say I didn't need him?\" Holmes turned, knelt down, looked Moira dead in the eye, and put a comforting hand on her shoulder. \"It will get better, I promise.\" He said. \"Just give it some time; you two will work things out, I'm sure you will.\" \"You think so?\" \"I know so. Now pardon me for asking this irrelevant question, but… is your last name truly Frankenstein?\" \"Yeah, so what?\" Before Holmes could reply, Moira suddenly heard a car. She turned around and saw a large white van parked at the museum entrance. Holmes's eyes widened when he saw the van. \"Oh no. Hide, quickly.\" He said before gesturing Moira into the nearby bushes for cover. \"Mr. Holmes, what's going on?\" Moira asked as she watched three figures exit the van and go towards the museum. Holmes's eyes narrowed at the men. \"…Trouble.\" In the museum, Watson kept himself hidden from the security cameras as well as the night guards that were on duty. He wandered the halls of the museum until he eventually found himself in a section filled with fossils, skeletons of different animals, and dioramas of prehistoric and ancient creatures. When he thought he was alone, he called out in a hushed tone, \"Peter? Peter, where are you?\" \"Hey.\" Peter's voice said from behind which made Watson jump; Peter looked around. \"Oh, it's just you. Sorry, Doctor. I didn't mean to scare you. But, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be joining Mr. Holmes at the Concert Hall?\" \"No, I came to talk to you… about you and your sister.\" Watson replied. \"…Forget it; there's nothing to talk about.\" \"Look, I know you're angry with her but this isn't the way to go about it. Moira is worried sick about you.\" \"Worried? About me ? Ha!\" \"No, really. She was on the verge of tears when you ran off.\" \"Well, how could you possibly know how I feel? It's like Moira doesn't even care about me anymore!\" \"Don't say that, of course she cares about you.\" \"Well she sure has a funny way of showing it.\" \"I'm sure you two will patch things up, as they say.\" \"…Not after how I called her a brat . She'll never forgive me for what I said.\" \"People get into fights all the time. It's not the end of the world.\" \"But it still happened; it's also our first huge fight. I can't get it outta my head. Ugh, why I said those awful things? I didn't mean them, none of them. I was just so mad and…\" \"I understand, Peter; we all say things we don't mean. Holmes and I get into fights sometimes, too.\" \"Then how are you still working together?\" \"The thing about fights is that we argue about the thing that's bothering us and after the fight, we try to fix it.\" \"But don't friendships end because of a fight?\" \"Fights are normal. But I believe some relationships end due to the lack of a fight. If you don't talk it out, it will never be resolved. It's what Holmes and I do.\" \"Speaking of Mr. Holmes, I don't even know how you put up with him. He seems so annoying.\" \"Now I admit he can get a little cocky and arrogant at times but despite his flaws and questionable tactics, Shamus is truly a brilliant detective. He and I have been working together since his final year of high school; we've always been there for each other. He listens to me, he follows some of my ideas, and he shows me admiration and respect. Shamus may seem a bit full of himself at first glance, but he truly has a good heart; I've seen him display it many times before.\" \"You sure about that?\" \"Of course. But Peter, you must also know that we all have our good and bad sides; Holmes, your sister… even me and you. Do you understand?\" Peter thought about what Watson was saying and what Moira had told him before this whole mess started; he realized that was being pretty overprotective of her and it wasn't right of him to lash out at her like that. \"You're right.\" He sighed. \"I shouldn't have run off like that, I was just being selfish. I need to go back and make things right between me and Moira.\" \"That's the spirit.\" Watson said before pausing. \"Wait…\" \"What's wrong?\" Peter asked before Watson stopped him. \"I hear something.\" The Doctor whispered; he then noticed three large shadows approaching them and he froze. \"We need to hide.\" \"Why? Whoa!\" Peter shouted as Watson grabbed his hand and ran down the hall to find someplace to hide. Three large men entered the room and looked around for anything suspicious; Peter and Watson were hiding behind a stuffed wooly mammoth. \"What's going on?\" Peter asked, trying to get a good view. \"Shush! Stay down, or they'll see us!\" Watson hissed as he pulled the boy back down. \"Who?\" Peter whispered before the Doctor covered the boy's mouth with his hand. \"Oye, someone's in here…\" One man said to his colleagues. \"Maybe it's Holmes and Watson.\" Another said. \"Perfect. The boss is gonna be VERY pleased if we catch them.\" The third added. \"We need to get out of here, NOW.\" Watson whispered to Peter as they tried to sneak away. Peter then spotted an emergency exit on the other side of the room; he nudged Watson and pointed a finger at it. The doctor nodded and slowly walked towards it with Peter right behind him, staying as quiet and careful as possible. But what they both failed to notice was the yellow wet floor sign that was standing a few feet away. Peter stepped down on the wet spot and his foot slipped, nearly causing him to fall, but Watson caught him just in time. It was then that Peter took a coin out of his pocket and threw it in a different direction to distract their pursuers. \"What was that noise?\" The first man asked. \"It came from over there.\" The second man said as he headed towards the noise; his friends followed. Peter and Watson smiled as they headed towards the emergency exit but the moment they opened the door, bright red lights started flashing and a loud siren sounded. The two froze in place; the three men surrounded them with sinister looks in their faces. \"Hello, Doctor Watson.\" They said in unison. \"…Run.\" Watson and Peter said before they ran off as fast as they could. \"Get them!\" The three men screamed before chasing after them. Back outside, Holmes and Moira could hear the sirens going off from inside the museum. \"Mr. Holmes? What's going on now?\" Moira asked nervously. \"Someone set off the museum alarm.\" Holmes replied. \"You don't think it's Peter and Dr. Watson, do you?\" \"It could be, and yet it could also be… Oh no!\" \"What is it?\" \"Get down or they'll see us!\" They ducked back into the bushes before the museum doors opened and the three men came out… with Peter and Watson in their grip; Moira's eyes widened in shock and horror. \"Peter?!\" She gasped. \"And Watson!\" Holmes added, flabbergasted. \"Hey, let us go!\" Peter demanded as he struggled to get free. \"You'll never get away with this, McChucky's!\" Watson yelled. \"Nice try, boys.\" One man said as he opened the van backdoors. \"Wait, you can't do this!\" Peter cried before he and Watson were then violently thrown into the back of the van where their wrists and ankles were bound with strong rope. One man had quickly put a long piece of duct tape onto Peter's mouth while Watson had a satin handkerchief stuffed into his mouth to keep both of them quiet. And with that, the doors shut, trapping the pair inside the van. \"That oughta do it.\" The leader said. \"But what about Holmes, Big Dave? He's still out there somewhere.\" A second man said. \"And that little girl?\" The third added. \"Don't worry about them, fellows.\" The leader, Big Dave, said. \"This is just what the boss wanted. Larry, Jerry; let's get going.\" The three brothers got into the van and drove away from the museum as fast as they could… leaving Shamus Holmes and Moira behind. \"Watson…\" Holmes whispered solemnly. Moira was horrified and mournful at the same time; she began to cry. \"Peter, no…\" She wept, burying her face in her hands. \"Come along, Moira.\" Holmes said, putting a comforting arm around the girl's shoulder. Moira wiped her eyes with her sleeve, made her way out of her hiding place, and trailed after Holmes as he was heading towards the Concert Hall. \"We must keep going. All of those people are depending on us…\"[Chapter 9] \"Mr. Holmes, are you okay? You're awfully quiet.\" Moira solemnly commented as she and Holmes wandered through the White Rose Concert Hall. When no one was around to see, Holmes opened a door and led the little girl into a room that looked down upon a lavish stage where an opera she didn't understand was being held; no one could see them or even hear them from up there. \"This is the darkest day of my career.\" Holmes replied after a long moment of silence. \"I cannot believe that Moriarty would stoop so low… hire the McChucky brothers to—\" \"Wait, what?!\" Moira exclaimed. \" That's what you care about?! Some random guys?!\" \"These 'random guys' are not ordinary men. They're—\" \"My brother was just kidnapped by them! He's gone, along with Dr. Watson, your partner ! Why aren't you sad or angry or anything ?!\" For a moment, she thought she caught a glimpse of shock in the eyes of Shamus, until a cold expression formed on his face. \"Sadness and anger will not help me find or save anyone , let alone the missing people.\" Holmes replied sternly. \"Emotion is the enemy of logic.\" \"Logic, shmogic!\" \"Quiet! You'll get us caught if you keep shouting. You are being difficult.\" \"Oh, I'm the one being difficult? What about you , huh? When will you stop being so stubborn and full of yourself?\" \"When will you finally act responsible and grow up ?\" \"That's not an answer!\" Moira stomped her foot and frowned at the detective. Out of anger, Holmes spun on his heels, grabbed her by the arm, and glared down at her. \"The case can't wait! You can!\" He snapped. Moira's eyes softened as the detective glowered at her; she felt like a knife was just jabbed into her heart. She heard those words before, but she said them to Peter earlier that day. And now, she might never be able to take it back. Holmes let go of her arm before she slowly wandered away from him. \"And just where do you think you are off to?\" He asked. \"…I just want to be alone.\" Moira replied before sitting down in a corner of the room and pulling her knees to her chest. Holmes rolled his eyes and shook his head in annoyance before he heard the little girl begin to sob and his anger softened. He hadn't meant to make her cry; he was only trying to show her who was in charge. 'She's not really… Is she? No, she's just trying to get under my skin. Why won't this child cooperate and do as she's told like a good little girl should ? She is so… so difficult.' He thought. 'But, I… I didn't mean…' He let out a sigh of defeat and reluctantly approached the girl before sitting down beside her, taking off his coat, and wrapping it around her shoulders. \"I said… I want to be alone .\" Moira retorted in between sobs; she scooted further away from him and squeezed her eyes shut. \"…I'm sorry.\" Holmes said suddenly; Moira's eyes flew open in response. \"I'm sorry for snapping at you. I didn't mean to hurt you or make you cry.\" \"No.\" She replied. \"I'm not crying because what you said was mean… I'm crying because I said the same thing to Peter! What was I thinking? I knew I shouldn't have listened to Giselle and her stupid cat! But I did anyway and now look at me! Running around a huge city thousands of miles away from home with an eccentric stranger looking for my entire missing family! Am I insane ?!\" \"Don't say that.\" \"Oh, I just wanna go home! I want my mommy and daddy! I want my family!\" She cried even harder. Holmes's eyes softened and he frowned; he had absolutely no idea how to make a helpless crying child feel better, especially since he knew so little about her. So he did the only thing he could think of: pick her up and set her down on to his lap. Moira looked up at Holmes, surprised by this sudden act of tenderness. \"W-w-what are you…?\" She began before Holmes stopped her. \"Hush. Everything is going to be alright.\" He said sympathetically. \"I know you're afraid, and who could blame you? … I am too.\" \"You? Afraid ?\" \"Yes, but that isn't the point. The point is that we cannot let our own fear keep us from doing what we need to do. I know the stress is getting to you, but the city will be in grave danger and you and I are all London has right now. We must be brave and keep our eyes open, or else everything will fall into ruin. Do you understand that, Moira?\" Moira knew this would be a huge responsibility to take on, especially for someone as young as her, but she also knew that she had to be strong or she would never see her family again. She looked back up at Holmes and wiped her eyes. \"…Yeah, I guess I do… And I suppose being a downer or a crybaby doesn't get anyone anywhere. You're right, I'm sorry.\" She whimpered. \"Don't be.\" Holmes said, gently petting the girl's head. \"…And I'm sorry I yelled. However, you didn't let me finish.\" \"Finish what?\" \"My last sentence. I was going to say I cannot believe that Moriarty would hire the McChucky Brothers to kidnap Watson, in public nonetheless. That would never have happened if it weren't for me.\" \"Oh… So you do care about Dr. Watson?\" \"Of course I do. He's been my partner and closest friend since the beginning and I would do anything to get him back… And I'm guessing you would do the same for your brother.\" \"Of course. He's like my best friend since I was born. I didn't mean all of that stuff I said to him, you know.\" \"I know; we all say things we wish we could take back. But after all of this is done and behind us, I know for a fact that you two will reconcile and become the best of friends again, you'll see.\" The two sat in the corner together before Moira let out a small yawn; Holmes smirked. \"Sounds like someone is getting tired.\" He said playfully. \"What? No I'm not. I'm just… just…\" Moira retorted before she yawned again. \"You should rest.\" Holmes said. \"No! I wanna stay up and help you…\" \"I know you want to help me, but it won't do any good if you're exhausted. You've had a long and eventful day. And I'm sure it's way past your bedtime back home; a little girl like you needs her sleep. And don't worry; I'll keep an eye on things and protect you if anything happens.\" \"…Thanks, Mr. Holmes.\" \"For what?\" \"For… letting me talk to you AND for being there for me.\" \"Anytime.\" \"Goodnight, Mr. Holmes.\" \"Goodnight.\" And with that, Moira rested her head on the detective's chest, closed her eyes, and she fell fast asleep in his lap. Holmes gave a small smile as he heard her gentle breathing; he looked towards the stage and listened to the beautiful music that was playing outside. He softly sighed. 'Oh, Watson… What have I done?' 0-0-0-0-0-0 In another part of the city, the same white van from the museum was driving down a barren dirt road in the dead of night until it reached the doorway of an old manor. The McChucky Brothers got out of the vehicle, grabbed Peter and Watson, went into the manor, and threw their captives onto the floor. \"Nighty-night, boys. You'll have many more in here.\" Big Dave said mockingly before shutting the doors, leaving Watson and Peter in complete darkness. \"Well, well, well… Hello, Doctor Watson.\" A deep voice said mockingly followed by the sound of footsteps. A hand suddenly reached out and roughly removed the cloth from Watson's mouth. He spat and sputtered before looking up and saying, \"Hello, Moriarty .\" The lights switched on and a tall, round man with graying brown hair, a huge mustache, and wearing expensive looking clothing was seen standing before Peter and Watson with a sinister smile on his face. This was Professor Nigel Moriarty. \"Long time no see.\" Watson hissed. \"Indeed.\" Moriarty said before directing his attention to Peter; he sneered at the boy as he approached him. \"And who's your little friend, Joey? I've never seen him before, and I know everyone in this city.\" \"Stay away from him. He's just a boy.\" Moriarty ignored Watson completely as he grabbed the tape around Peter's mouth and brutally ripped it right off of his face, causing Peter to scream in pain and even cry a little. Moriarty cackled cruelly at the boy. \"Ha! What a laugh.\" He bellowed before kneeling in front of him. \"What's your name, son?\" Peter said nothing. \"What, are you deaf? Mute? Dumb? Tell me your name, boy. Come on, spit it out.\" And that's just what Peter did; he angrily spat right into Moriarty's eye, which made the professor jump back in surprise and anger. \"Agh, my eye! You will pay for that.\" He snarled. \"Leave the boy alone, Nigel. Isn't it me you want?\" Watson yelled. \"No, not you . What I really want is HOLMES. You know where he is, don't you, Joseph?\" \"Why should he tell you anything?\" Peter hissed. \"Oh, so you can talk.\" The sinister Professor said, glaring back at Peter. \"So you'll tell me who you are?\" \"I'm not allowed to talk to strangers.\" \"Ugh, a child with an attitude . Is there anything more tiresome? Someone get him out of here.\" \"If you take him away, you'll have to do the same to me .\" Watson retorted. \"Fine. I'll lock you both up until further notice.\" Moriarty said as he picked Peter up off of the floor and threw him over his shoulder. Larry and Jerry McChucky grabbed Watson by the arms and dragged him along the stone floor by his heels behind Moriarty. They walked down the halls until they were taken to a room in a far corner of the manor. Peter and Watson's restraints were let loose and they were thrown into the room. \"I'm sure you two will love it in here.\" Moriarty said as he turned on the lights. Watson and Peter looked and they saw all of the missing citizens of London… including Victor, Elsa, Jonathon, and Lydia. Peter gasped in shock and joy. \"Mom, dad! Grandpa, grandma!\" He yelled as he ran over to them. \"Peter! Oh, my baby boy!\" Elsa wept as she hugged her son tight. \"Peter? So that's your name!\" Moriarty exclaimed; no one paid attention to him, though. \"Are you okay, dear? Did those goons hurt you?\" Lydia asked as she examined her grandson. \"No, no. Don't worry, guys; I'm fine.\" Peter replied. \"Wait, your sister isn't with you.\" Jonathon pointed out. 'Sister?' Moriarty thought as he stroked his beard. \"She's not here. Where's your sister? Where is she? Is she okay? Where is Moira?!\" Victor asked urgently. \"I-I don't know.\" Peter stuttered nervously. \"She and I got into a fight outside the history museum, we split up, and-and…\" \"Oh, a typical quarrel amongst family; how delightful . I wish I could stay and watch, but I have important business to attend to.\" Moriarty said as he headed towards the door. \"Sweet dreams, everyone. We'll see you tomorrow. Keep an eye on them, Big Dave; ALL of them.\" Moriarty exited the room and the door slammed shut; Peter looked back at his family shamefully. \"I'm so sorry.\" He said as he tucked his knees into his chest. \"I know I was supposed to protect Moira, but I did a pretty lousy job of doing it. Now she's out in London with no clue what to do or where to go; this is all my fault. I'm the worst brother ever.\" \"Peter, don't say that.\" Victor said as he comforted his son. \"We all make mistakes. But the important thing now is that you're with us. But what we need to do now is find a way out of here and get back to your sister.\" \"Yes, but we need to do it soon.\" Watson said as he joined the group. \"Moriarty is planning on killing all of us tomorrow night if Holmes and Moira don't find us by then.\" \"Kill us?!\" Lydia cried in terror. \"Hold up, Moira is out there? My daughter is wandering the city of London? ALL BY HERSELF ?!\" Elsa shrieked in fear and anger. \"No, no, no! She's not alone; my partner Shamus is with her. He knows this city like the back of his hand. Trust me, she'll be perfectly safe with him.\" Watson said reassuringly. \"And if I'm not mistaken, they've most likely left the museum and now they're at the…\" \"…the White Rose Concert Hall, of course! That's where they must've gone!\" Peter concluded. \"Oye, keep it down in there!\" Big Dave yelled as he banged on the wood of the door with his fist. \"You lot are givin' me a headache with all your jabberin' and I'm not very nice with a headache!\" The room quickly went silent. Peter and Watson looked at each other nervously; they knew they had to think of something soon or everyone in that room will die, including them. But as of right now, they had no idea what to do.[Chapter 10] The light of the morning sun flooded through a tiny glass window and into the Concert Hall. Moira remained sound asleep in Holmes's lap with his coat covering her body to keep warm; Holmes was sleeping just as soundly, until the sunlight shined onto his face. He begrudgingly opened his eyes and yawned. 'Not exactly the best night's sleep I've ever had.' He thought before he looked down and saw Moira still sleeping with her head resting on his chest; he was about to nudge her awake when he stopped himself. 'She is… rather cute when she's asleep. I almost don't want to wake her up.' Holmes's thoughts were suddenly interrupted by his stomach letting out a low hungry growl. He blushed in embarrassment before Moira stirred; she was waking up. He gently shook her shoulder. \"Wake up, Moira.\" He said in a whisper. \"It's time to get up.\" Moira yawned, opened her eyes, and looked up to see Holmes's big dark eyes looking down at her. She jumped out of his hold in surprise. \"Oh! Good morning, Mr. Holmes.\" She said as she quickly stood up. \"You could say it's a good morning, my dear…\" Holmes began as he took his coat and put it back on. \"…for I've cracked the clue.\" \"Really? That's great! What does it mean?\" \"It means… I think we should leave first before we got spotted by security or the custodians. We can go out through the back and discuss this outside.\" Holmes took Moira's hand, walked over to the door, and they carefully made their way through the empty Concert Hall and over to the back exit. When they finally made it out, they went around back to the front and sat down on a nearby bench. Holmes took the pamphlet out of his coat and laid it down on his lap, explaining his deductions. \"This is what I found out.\" He began, taking out a small pale twig. \"I found this little stick taped to the brochure while it was still folded into a plane. Notice the peeling white bark? This stick came from the branch of a common birch tree, which are very amble in Highland Park, one of the most popular parks in the city. And see the list of upcoming events on the brochure? One of them is circled: the Festival of Medieval Times, which is held in Highland Park every spring… and the Festival starts today . So if I'm not mistaken, and I rarely am, Moriarty has most likely hidden our next clue somewhere in the park.\" Moira then noticed something in one corner of the far right-hand page, it looked like a circle with little markings inside; she squinted her eyes, but it was too small to read. She took a magnifying glass out of the pocket of her dress and took a closer look. She gasped as she saw the roman numerals for 3, 6, 9, and 12; two arrows were pointing at 12. \"A clock!\" Moira cried out. \"Come again?\" Holmes asked. \"This! This is like a clock! Over here, look!\" She exclaimed before she opened the watch around her neck. \"See? Two arrows are pointing at the 12, which could mean one of two things; noon and midnight! Maybe Professor Moriarty wants us at the Medieval Times Festival in Highland Park at noon today!\" Holmes's eyes widened at the little girl; he hadn't even noticed that. \"Moira… that is BRILLIANT!\" He exclaimed. \"I can't believe I missed that! Well done. Wait… Moriarty wants us there by noon ? What time is it now?\" Moira looked at her watch and said, \"It's almost 10:00.\" \"Oh no! It usually takes a good hour and a half to get to the park from here, minus any awful traffic. We're running out of time! Come on!\" Holmes said as he stood up and ran down the sidewalk with Moira following close behind. \"Wait, Mr. Holmes! Slow down! Mr. Holmes, does everyone in London know who you are?\" Moira asked as she stopped to catch her breath. \"A little irrelevant to the mission, but yes; almost everyone. Why?\" \"Wouldn't it be weird for a strange little girl no one here has ever seen before to be walking around a medieval themed faire with the finest consulting detective in London?\" Holmes paused, realizing that she did make a valid point; it would look odd for people to see him walking around with some young stranger. He didn't want anyone to be suspicious of him or his new companion and he certainly didn't want his reputation tarnished; he looked back at Moira. \"Yes you're right, but fear not.\" He said. \"For I'm not just a master of deduction ; I'm also a master of disguise . And you , my dear Moira, are going to help me.\" Moira's eyes widened. \"Really? I'm really going to help you?\" \"Of course you are. That is, if we still have a deal…?\" Holmes held out his hand to the little girl, and she shook it vigorously as she grinned. \"Of course we do! Ooh, I've always wanted to go in disguise!\" Holmes chuckled. \"I really do admire your enthusiasm, my dear. And luckily, I have the perfect costumes in mind for the both of us.\" \"Oh? What do you have in mind?\" Holmes smiled. \"Moira? How do you feel about… princesses ?\" 0-0-0-0-0-0 At the park, everything was decorated with banners and flags and everyone there was dressed in clothes from Medieval Times. \"Make way, everyone! Make a path! Step aside for Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Fronkenshteen!\" Everyone suddenly moved to the sides as two figures entered the Festival; one was tall and wearing a black gown and headdress with a veil while the other was small and wearing a royal purple dress and a golden tiara. It was Holmes and Moira disguised as a princess and her lady in waiting, both of them wearing fancy looking masks to hide their identities. Moira was struggling not to trip over the skirt of her dress while Holmes was having no trouble. \"Mr. Holmes? How can girls walk in these huge dresses? And where did you even find them?\" She whispered. \"Hush, stay in character.\" Holmes hissed. \"And be sure to smile and wave your hand the way I showed you.\" \"Sorry; I'm still pretty new at this.\" \"I can tell.\" Moira smirked to herself and did as she was told as they continued to walk through the park. \"Tell me again why you're dressed as a lady in waiting and not a knight. Or even a lord, a prince, or a king.\" The little girl muttered. \"The only suit of armor I could find was far too big, along with other tunics, belts, and capes. And I've dressed as a woman more than once in my career.\" Holmes casually replied. \"…I don't wanna know.\" Holmes suddenly stopped, but Moira looked in a different direction and she bumped right into him. \"Oof! Careful!\" He hissed. \"Sorry, sorry!\" The girl said sheepishly. \"It's alright. But remember, we need to keep our eyes and ears open as well as not draw any negative attention.\" \"Got it.\" Moira waved her hand and smiled a toothy, slightly nervous grin as she and Holmes continued walking, but he rolled his eyes in annoyance when he glanced over at her. \"Oh dear; that is the LEAST realistic royal wave and smile I have ever seen.\" He sighed as they sat down on a bench near a fake castle. \"Well sorry, but I've never dressed up like a princess before, let alone acted like one.\" Moira retorted. \"You haven't? Well, you should've told me that before I took you on as my assistant.\" The little girl's eyes widened and she gasped. \"…Am I really your assistant?!\" She asked. \"Shhh!\" Holmes put a hand up to silence her. \"Do you hear that?\" \"Hear what?\" \"Shh, listen.\" Holmes concentrated his hearing on the sounds he heard with one hand to his ear. As birds sang, children laughed, people talked, and music played, he scanned the birch trees until a particular sound caught his ear. \"That sound. That's not a bird; that's the call of the Peruvian Snapping Turtle.\" He whispered; Moira was confused. \"What? That doesn't make sense. What would a snapping turtle from Peru be doing all the way up here?\" She asked. \"That's the thing; this call doesn't sound genuine.\" Holmes deducted. \"It sounds like… like a recording. But where is it…?\" He looked up and saw a tape recorder perched on the branch of another tree. \"Aha! The Peruvian Snapping Turtle is famous for burying its eggs; he must've buried the clue. Somewhere around here, but where…?\" Beneath the device in the tree was a spot of dirt buried out of the earth where the clue used to be. \"Oh. It's been dug up by…\" He scanned the area for the culprit, until his eyes landed on a few familiar creatures, a few that Holmes hoped he would never have to encounter again. \"Oh… Don't move!\" He whispered worriedly as he pulled the veil over his face to avoid being seen, even though the creatures were asleep. Moira looked in that direction; all she saw were three big dogs snoring near another bench, a Doberman, a Rottweiler, and a German Shepherd. \"What's wrong? It's just a few dogs.\" She said; she was puzzled by Holmes's sudden reprehension. \"You don't understand. Those three BEASTS are no mere dogs.\" He explained, eying the dogs warily. \"Those, my dear, are the hounds owned by the Baskervilles, one of the richest families in the entire city. And in this very park, all THREE of those very hounds bit me… and I still have the scars to prove it.\" \"Scars? Come on, it can't be that bad.\" Holmes pulled down the sleeve of his dress and revealed the huge bite marks on his left shoulder and bicep from those same dogs; Moira's eyes widened in shock and disgust. \"Whoa! That is nasty.\" \"That's just what the doctor said; he also said I was very lucky to survive the attack. Those things could've very well torn me to pieces or even KILLED me if I wasn't careful. Or if they really wanted to. I'm still rather curious as to why the Baskervilles haven't gone missing.\" He then noticed something else sitting next to the bench; his eyes widened again. \"What now?\" \"Do you know what that is?\" Holmes pointed a finger at the stroller parked beside the hounds. \"…A stroller?\" Moira answered, not sure if that was the answer he was after. \"Yes. That explains it.\" \"Explains what?\" \"When I last encountered the Baskervilles, I noticed that Mrs. Baskerville had a rather rounded, taut belly; she must've been pregnant.\" \"Yeah, so?\" \"That was nearly eight months ago. They've had a new baby during that time… and it's sleeping right in that stroller. First Chinatown, now these fleabags and that little monstrosity. This is no coincidence.\" \"This is gonna tricky, huh?\" \"Oh yes, and everything else was just peachy.\" \"I can deal without your sarcasm, thank you very much.\" As she inspected the dogs and stroller, Moira's eyes narrowed; she had an idea. She got up from the bench. \"Wait here for me.\" She said as she made her way over to the dogs. \"Wait, what? Moira, what are you doing? Get back here. Young lady, come back here this instant!\" Holmes cried out in a worried whisper. 'She is going to die…' Holmes watched in terror as Moira snuck over to the bench. She got on all fours and crawled under the bench just behind the dogs, hoping they wouldn't wake up and sniff her out. She noticed that the M card was wrapped around a squeaky toy which was under the paw of the Rottweiler. 'I can do this.' She thought. She carefully reached out her hand to grab the squeaker and working as gently as she could, Moira successfully managed to pry the bone out from the dog's grip. She grinned. \"Come on, kid. Quit wasting my time!\" A voice yelled. Moira froze and turned her head to see a woman and her son talking to a man dressed as a royal jester; she wasn't sure what was going on. \"Hey, you can't talk to my son that way! Who do you think you are?\" The woman yelled. \"I'm the Queen's Jester, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers.\" The jester retorted. \"Hey, you can't talk about my wife that way.\" A burly man said as he stood by his wife. \"What do you think this is?\" \"I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what this is.\" \"Hey, you can't talk to my grandson like that.\" An elderly woman added. \"Someone oughta put you in a mental hospital.\" \"Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma!\" \"You're probably right.\" The old woman sighed. \"You people are crazy!\" Moira rolled her eyes and tried to crawl out from under the bench as quietly as possible. A fanfare suddenly sounded, causing Moira to jump, hit her head on the bench, and accidentally squeeze the toy bone in her hand. \"Ow!\" She cried out in pain. That was enough to wake the baby up from its nap and start crying very loudly; the dogs woke up soon afterwards and the quickly growled fiercely at the thief who stole their bone. \"Oh no…\" Moira muttered as she stood up and hid the bone behind her back. \"Uh, nice doggies. Nice BIG doggies. Uh, go away please. You don't really wanna hurt me, do you?\" \"Moira, RUN!\" Holmes screamed. And boy, did she run. She ran as best as she could in her dress, which was rather difficult. \"Good doggies, nice doggies!\" Moira screamed as she raced across the park back over to Holmes. \"Did you get the clue?\" He asked. \"Right here.\" She replied before continuing to run with Holmes right beside her. \"Where are we going now?!\" \"Anywhere but here !\" Holmes replied. \"This way!\" Spotting a golf kart in a nearby backstage area, Moira realized it could help them escape. \"No, this way! Follow me, I have an idea!\" She took Holmes's hand and led him towards the vehicle. Holmes was practically dragged through the park while he tried not to trip over the skirt of his disguise. Many of the park's inhabitants were watching the scene unfold with confused looks. The pair climbed into the kart. \"Moira, what are you doing?!\" Holmes demanded. \"We're driving outta here!\" The girl answered. \"But you CAN'T DRIVE!\" \"That's where you come in! You maneuver the pedals while I steer!\" \"Isn't there another option?\" Before Moira could answer, three sets of barking were heard. Holmes froze. \"On second thought, you drive.\" He lifted her onto his lap and he buckled them both in. \"Hold on tight!\" Turning the key in the ignition and grabbing hold of the gear shifter, Moira started up the engine. \"STEP ON IT!\" Holmes stepped down hard on the accelerator pedal and the kart took off in a flash. Holmes gripped the seat beneath him as the little girl sitting on top of him was trying her best to steer clear of any attractions and pedestrians with the three dogs still running after them and barking. Being only eight years old, Moira had no idea how to drive and she was doing a pretty clumsy job. The dogs were catching up and Moira made the cart make some pretty sharp turns, but it didn't slow down those relentless hounds. Holmes looked around and found a lever; he thought it would help, so he pressed down on it and shards of grass rained down on the dogs to slow them down. \"Nice move.\" Moira complimented. \"Thank you.\" The detective replied before the kart hit part of a small fence, which caused Moira to fall off. Luckily, she didn't fall off completely and her legs and dress were dangling off the side and right in front of one of the pursuing dogs. The dog caught hold of Moira's skirt and began pulling at her. She screamed as she tried to keep her grip on the steering wheel as well as her eyes on the road; Holmes held onto her tightly and pulled, locked in a tug-of-war with the dog. \"Let go of her!\" He shouted, hitting the squeaky toy on the dog's head in order to make him let go; the other two dogs were now following their comrade. \"Who's a good doggy?! Ugh, they won't go away!\" Moira got another idea. \"Hey, grab the clue and throw them the squeaker! It's what they're after!\" Quickly, Holmes pulled the card from the toy. \"Got it!\" Then he raised the toy over his head and threw it away from him and Moira, causing the three dogs to let go of the dress and chase after the toy. He hoisted Moira back onto his lap before she turned to face forward again. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yeah, I'm good.\" She replied. \"Ah, there. That wasn't so…\" Holmes was about to sigh in relief, until things took a turn for the worse. \"…BAAAAD!\" While they were struggling, Moira had accidentally steered the kart towards a tile of stacked chairs and picnic tables and, while they were both screaming, the kart soared through the air and crashed into a tree that stood in front of the tables and chairs. Luckily, Holmes and Moira had unbuckled themselves and they jumped out of the golf kart before anyone could notice; they landed in the nearby duck pond with a loud splash. A huge crowd of people came around to see what was going on; the dogs, on the other hand, continued to happily chew on their toy. In the duck pond, Moira and Holmes emerged from the water, gasping and wheezing for air while simultaneously spitting out the disgusting water. They quickly made a run for it while everyone was distracted by the golf kart still lodged in the tree. They ran to the wall, climbed over it, and ran down the sidewalk until they went into an alley way next to a Laundromat. They took off their costumes, dried themselves off with some towels and got back into their original clothes, breathing heavily. \"What a rush.\" Moira heaved as she finished drying her hair with the towel. \"Well, that was a bit of unconventional parking.\" Holmes commented, tossing his towel to the side and tying his scarf around his neck. \"Okay, now that you and I are out of harm's way again , can we see what the next clue is?\" \"Certainly.\" Holmes held up the M card, flipped it over, and found a diamond ring taped to the other side. The moment he saw it, he gasped in terror and he went pale. \"Of course this would be next. I should've known.\" He muttered. \"Nigel Moriarty, you monster. Forcing me to face my greatest fears…\" Moira took the ring and inspected it; she raised an eyebrow. \"A ring? What's so scary about this ?\" Holmes didn't answer her question. His only response was, \"Very well. If he wants to dance, then dance we shall!\" He made a dramatic pose. Shaking her head and giggling under her breath, Moira walked out of the alley with the ring still in her hand. Holmes noticed her leaving and with a sigh, he followed after her.[Chapter 11] \"Peter, would you give the pacing a rest, please?\" Watson asked. \"I'm getting dizzy.\" \"Sorry, but I'm desperate. There has to be a way out of here!\" Peter said as he stopped. \"The door is locked and there aren't any windows, so the only way out is the skylight.\" Lydia explained to her grandson; he looked up at the window in the ceiling. \"But there's no way to get up there.\" \"There has to be. I'm gonna do whatever it takes o get all of us out of here and back to Moira.\" Peter said, sounding determined. \"What we need is a plan.\" \"And I believe I already have one.\" Watson said. \"I just need a pen and some paper.\" \"Will these work, doctor?\" Jonathon asked as he took a notepad and a pen out of his coat pocket. \"Yes, that's perfect. Thank you, sir.\" Watson opened the notepad and began to draw a diagram of the room with the pen. He showed it to Peter. \"Peter, you and I can scale those bricks, grab onto that wooden beam, shimmy our way across it, reach the skylight, get around to the door, open it from the other side, and lead everyone to freedom.\" \"Sounds like a good plan to me.\" Peter commented. \"But if you two are going to escape, you'll need to distract the McChucky's.\" Victor pointed. \"Oh yeah, good point. How are we gonna do that?\" Peter asked. \"Why don't you leave the distraction to us ?\" Elsa suggested. \"Are you sure, mom?\" \"We'll be fine, sweetie. You and Dr. Watson need to get out of here and find your sister and this Mr. Holmes.\" \"Yeah. We'll deal with those goons.\" Victor added. \"Thanks, guys.\" Peter hugged his parents tight. The door suddenly flew open; everyone jumped at the sight of Big Dave enter with an annoyed look on his face. \"Oye! What's goin' on in here?!\" He demanded; he saw Peter and his parents hugging and gagged at the sight. \"Ugh. If you're going to show emotion, do it on your own time.\" He slammed the door. \"I suggest we act fast, or else.\" Watson muttered; Peter nodded as he looked at the skylight. 0-0-0-0-0-0 \"Mr. Holmes, how much longer?\" Moira asked as Holmes practically dragged her along the sidewalk. \"There it is. That's where the clue is leading us.\" He cried, gesturing to the building that stood before them. There was a large sign hanging over the door that read 'Imogen's Gems'. \"A jewelry store?\" Moira questioned. \"Yes. This ring belongs to an old acquaintance of mine; the boss of the most successful jeweler in London.\" Holmes explained before leading the little girl to the store's door. He rapped the glass of the door lightly and a redheaded woman dressed in pink answered. \"Hello, Agnes.\" \"What do you want?\" The woman asked. \"I need to speak to your boss.\" He held up the ring. \"What for?\" Agnes questioned. \"It's very important that I speak with her post haste.\" Holmes replied; Moira nodded. Reluctantly, Agnes opened the door. She chuckled. \"Your funeral.\" Holmes swallowed nervously as he took Moira's hand and led her into the shop. Inside, the walls were all painted pink, there were display cases lining the walls, and all kinds of gems and jewels were inside. A few women wearing the same shade of pink as Agnes were also inside; they must've been the employees. Holmes led Moira to a desk in the very back of the shop where two women stood. \"Which one's the boss?\" She asked, looking frightened. \"Neither. Stay close to me.\" Holmes shook his head and held her hand tight; she nodded. \"He wants to speak to Miss Adler.\" Agnes said. The two girls behind the counter nodded their heads at her then at each other and quickly went into the back room through another door. Moira couldn't tell what was going on behind that door, but soon the girls returned with another woman following them. This woman had short blonde hair, fair skin, long eyelashes, bright red lipstick, and she was wearing a frilly pink dress with matching gloves, leggings, shoes, and even a wide-brimmed hat atop her head. She gave Holmes a death stare before saying, \"Shamus Holmes. You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here.\" \"Hello, Imogen.\" Holmes greeted with a slight tremor in his voice. \"You're looking well.\" \"A letter. You ended our engagement in a letter.\" Imogen elegantly snapped. 'Engaged? They used to be a couple?! Holy cow! No wonder Mr. Holmes looks so tense!' Moira thought, looking up at Holmes in disbelief. \"Now after months of silence, you show up with…\" Imogen looked around in confusion, but then she looked down to see Moira giving her a nervous smile. The little girl suddenly froze under the gaze of those icy eyes glaring down at her. \"…You brought a CHILD with you?!\" Almost as if on reflex, Moira hid behind Holmes for safety as fast as she could. He put a comforting hand on her head before turning to Imogen and saying, \"Moira is only here because her family has gone missing.\" \"What's she been doing? Whining or complaining?\" Imogen laughed. \"Excuse me?!\" Moira scowled. \"She's a friend , Imogen.\" Holmes tried to explain. \"Friend? Whatever happened to 'temporary assistant'?\" Moira asked. \"That, too.\" \"Temporary assistant?\" Imogen paused. \"Is this some kind of joke, Shamus? Bringing a child with you? And a YANK of all people?\" Moira huffed and folded her arms in annoyance; how could Shamus even have feelings for a woman like this? \"Moira Frankenstein is much smarter than she looks.\" Holmes said. \" She was the one who retrieved the last clue in the first place, down at Highland Park.\" \"Hmph. I'll believe it when I see it. But whatever happened to your old assistant, Joseph Watson?\" \"He is not my assistant, you know that. He is my partner… and he's missing, too.\" \"He is?\" Imogen's eyes widened ever so slightly. \"Yes. You see, he and my older, Peter, were kidnapped sometime last night and we need to find them as soon as possible.\" Moira explained. \"She's right. So you might as well hand over the next clue, Imogen.\" \" Me ? What makes you think I have it?\" \" This is one of yours, isn't it?\" Holmes held up the ring. \"This is the clue that led us here. You know more about gems and precious stones better than anyone else in this entire city. Don't tell me you don't recognize it. And don't even try lying to me.\" \"I don't know, Shamus.\" Imogen drawled. \"There are lots of rings in this city; that little bauble could belong to anyone.\" \"Imogen, please! We don't have time for this! Just hand over the clue.\" Holmes pleaded. \"Of course, you're only here on work. That's all you've ever cared about, really.\" Imogen snapped. \"Well, I'm sorry to say this but…\" She slowly pulled an M card out of the folds of her dress and held it up in from of Moira and Holmes. \"…if you want this card, then you'll have to pry it from my cold dead hand.\" \"Oh please. I'm not stooping to that level.\" Holmes scoffed. \"And neither am I .\" Moira huffed. \"Very well.\" Imogen snapped her fingers. \"Ladies, would you mind showing these two to the door?\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" Agnes said as she and three other employees grabbed Holmes and Moira and dragged them both to the door where they were pushed out of the store; the door slammed behind them. \"Well, that was rather unpleasant.\" Holmes said as he brushed off his coat. \"Yeah, no kidding.\" Moira said as she got back onto her feet. \"I knew she had the clue, because she was expecting me. She'll need at least one hour to cool down.\" \"What?! An hour ?! No! We don't have that kind of time!\" \"You think I don't know that? We'll need to think of some other way to get that clue.\" \"Relax. I got this.\" She marched right up to the door and started banging on it. \"Listen up, lady! You've got something I need and I am NOT leaving here without it!\" Holmes gasped, half-frightened by her actions. He stood up. \"Are you insane ? You can't provoke Imogen like that! There's no telling what she'll— Oh!\" The door unlocked and a young woman with fair skin and long hazelnut brown hair pulled into a ponytail stood in the doorway. Holmes froze; he immediately recognized her. \"Melody?\" He asked. \"Hello, Shamus.\" The woman said. \"I haven't seen you in ages. What are you doing working in a place like this?\" \"That's not important. I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Miss Adler. I'm very sorry about what happened to Dr. Watson.\" She looked at Moira. \"And your brother.\" \"You two know each other?\" Moira asked, looking back at Holmes. \"Melody and I have been schoolmates in our youth.\" Holmes explained. \"We used to be friends, however we both had different academic goals and pursuits. I was more interested in history and science while Melody here took a liking to cooking as well as the arts. But what are you doing here, Melody?\" \"My uncle forced me to get a job here.\" Melody replied. \"But that isn't the point. The point is… I can help you get the clue.\" \"You can?!\" Moira exclaimed. \"Yes and you can come with me. But I'm afraid you can't, Shamus. It's nothing personal; it's just the rules.\" \"Sorry, Mr. Holmes.\" \"Don't worry, Moira. I'll be waiting out here for you the entire time.\" \"Okay, let's go.\" And with that, Melody led Moira back into the shop. Imogen was about to go back into her office when she turned to see Moira approach the desk. Melody stood to the side and waited patiently. \"Oh, hello.\" She coldly greeted. \"Here I thought all Yanks were overweight and selfish. But you're actually… cute. Care to join me for some tea?\" Moira didn't have time to answer; there was already a cup of tea sitting in front of her. Agnes offered a bowl of sugar, which the little girl politely pushed away. \"Uh, no thank you. I just need—\" She started. \"I often wondered what it was like in the Colonies.\" Imogen interrupted. \"Wearing the same clothes every day would be like a fashion prison for me. And living as middle class must be awful. Living like a dog.\" Moira sighed. \"Look, I don't really have time for this. My family is in danger. So if you'll just please and over the clue—\" \"Work, work, work. Ugh. I can see why Shamus chose you.\" \"Wait, what ? What are you talking about? Mr. Holmes didn't choose me.\" \"And he never will. With Shamus, work always comes first. There's always another case to crack, another mystery to solve, another secret to uncover. A complete waste of time if you ask me.\" \"Well, I didn't ask you. And you don't understand.\" \"Oh, I understand perfectly.\" \"I don't like your tone, Miss Adler. What do you take me for anyway?\" \"I don't like your tone, Yank. What makes you think you can speak to me that way?\" \"ENOUGH!\" The room went quiet and everyone in the store directed their attention to Moira, Imogen, and Melody who was giving her employer a dark glare. \"I know it's none of my business, Imogen, but it's pretty clear to me that you never cared about Shamus.\" Melody ranted. \"From what I've seen, it's always been about you . While you two were together, it was never about what Shamus wanted or needed or even what he felt; I've seen it. He tried to be a good boyfriend to you, didn't he? I know he did. And what did you do? You just pushed him away and said it wasn't good enough. Nothing is ever good enough for you, is it?\" Moira suddenly stood straight. \"She's right. Sure, Mr. Holmes can be pretty stubborn and arrogant at times, but he's also brave and considerate. He even comforted me when I had a nervous breakdown last night. I even helped him get that clue back at the Medieval Festival. He believes in me, he listens to me, and it's pretty clear that he trusts me almost as much as he trusts Dr. Watson. And he said so himself that he would do anything to get him back.\" Imogen sat in silence for a moment or two before saying, \"A man doesn't make you strong.\" \"You're right. A man doesn't make you strong.\" Moira said. \"But the right partner or friend can make you stronger. But I've let my partner down… and now I need to make it right.\" Imogen stared at Moira and Melody with grudging respect and she was pretty impressed with their strength and words, although it was short-lived. \"Alright, fine. I'll give you what you want, child.\" Imogen sighed. \"But only on two conditions. Firstly, you tell Shamus this had nothing to do with him.\" \"Okay. And second?\" \"After you saved the day, you come back and tell me all about it.\" She handed the little girl the card. Moira smiled and took the card. \"Looks like we have a deal.\" She headed towards the door with Melody behind her. \"Mr. Holmes, I got the clue.\" \"Perfect!\" Holmes said as the girl gave him the clue. \"Thank you.\" The card had the infamous M on it and there was a bit of writing on the back. Holmes examined it before reading it aloud. \" You already know it's all about you. So what is the pattern in the final clue? \" \"What does it mean?\" Moira asked. \"That's what I'm trying to figure out. Where are they leading us?\" Holmes muttered before going into his mind palace again. Suddenly, it clicked. He remembered seeing different patterns on each card they had collected. \"Traitor's Gate, that's it! The entrance to the Tower of London! That was where Watson and I solved our first case. But it's on the other side of the city. There's only seven hours until midnight; we're running out of time.\" \"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go!\" Moira said as she started to run down the sidewalk. Holmes was about to follow her before he paused and looked back at Melody. He went over to her and as quickly as possible, gave her a peck on the cheek. \"Thank you.\" He said before running off. Melody put a hand to her cheek and blushed. Slowly, a smile crept onto her lips.

Victor Frankenstein turned the radio off on the inside of his father's car. Edward smiled at his scientific teenage son, a straight A student, with a passionate love for science, the fifteen year old was sucking on a pen, his essay was due at the end of the school year, but not a topic came to his head; his father couldn't understand why his son was so caught up in this when he had months to think of a topic! And it was only the second day of school! The car pulled into the parking lot of the high school, Victor grabbed his bag, and hopped out of the car. \"Bye dad!\" he called, making his way to the entrance. \"Don't think too much about that paper, son!\" and with that Edward drove away towards his work. Upon entrance, Victor was greeted with arms wrapped around his neck and a kiss to his cheek, causing the teen to blush a little, his girlfriend, Elsa, just gave a small smile to the rosy cheeked teen. \"You are coming to my party right? My uncle will be out of town, so it'll be just us teens.\" Victor blushed. \"I wouldn't miss it for the world.\" He replied as she gave a kiss to his cheek. \"I'll see you after class.\" And with that Elsa walked away, Victor placed his fingers to his cheek. \"Ye-yeah…see you.\" He blushed slightly a goofy smile lingered on his face. Edgar and Weird Girl rushed their way towards Victor, the couple both had rather happy expressions on their faces. \"Well didn't she tell you?\" Weird Girl asked, cocking her head to the side, giving a squeeze to a Hello Kitty plushie. Victor rose an eyebrow, did he miss something? \"Mayor Burgemeister is out of town!\" Edgar gave his hands the plotting ring to them. \"Uh…and?\" \"And, Elsa knows where he hides his wine and the key to get to his wine!\" \"Are you saying…\" \"We're going to get so wasted!\" Edgar did a double fist pump in the air. Victor gasped. \"But…we're too young! Elsa isn't that…\" but before he could finish. \"I know! It's going to be so cool!\" \"Do you think she'll have strawberry kisses?\" Weird Girl asked, cocking her head to the side, \"I've always wanted to try it!\" \"I don't know! But I can't wait to have my first drink of that wine!\" \"I can't wait to have that first drink of alcohol!\" Victor just walked away slowly from the couple, they sure were freaks…and he was glad he wasn't close to either of them. Yeah…so…uhm…R&R; my remake?[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 is still going to be the same… Victor sighed, it was Saturday evening, the day of the Elsa's party. Edgar's words were a little taunting. \"We're going to get so wasted!\" the memory replayed in his head, hopefully nothing would happen, like getting arrested, or anything like that. With the zip of his jeans he gave a pat to his old zombified dog, Sparky. Making his way downstairs, he was stopped by his mother upon his opening of the door. \"Where are you going, sweetie?\" Susan asked as Victor turned around. \"O-oh, I'm going on a date! With Elsa. We're going to hang at her house and watch a movie or two.\" \"Oh, well have fun!\" and with that she went back to her soap opera. Victor was lucky she took the lie, if she knew about the party…she would probably flip out. He made his way to the mayor's house, and when he was close enough, he could hear loud pop music erupt from the house, he pressed the doorbell. Ding dong \"Who is it?\" The voice sounded like a slurred version of Toshiaki. \"Uh…Victor…\" \"Oh!\" the door opened revealing a rather messy looking Elsa, holding a wine bottle, she took a drink, and smiled. \"Viccccctorrrrrrrrr!\" she slurred, \"You made iiiiiit!\" She wrapped her arms around his neck and gave a full-fledged kiss to his lips. \"Are you…drunk?\" he asked as she hiccupped and laughed. \"Yeah! Isn't this great!\" Victor walked in to the sight of every one in his grade unable to keep their balance and laughing at nothing. \"Well…\" he began, as Elsa shoved an opened wine bottle in his hands. \"Live a littttllllle Vicctorrrr!\" as Victor took a drink from the bottle, one bottle, that's ALL he was having! However that one drink made him feel…different…different how, he didn't know. But it felt so good! Soon enough, with every drink he took, he was laughing at the most ridiculous things, the more drinks he took the fuzzier everything became, another drink and everything went blurry. He could feel blankets covering him, he opened his eyes to see a small alarm clock, 4:15 AM. He rose only to be brought back down to the pain of his head. He wasn't in his room. Then he remembered, the party…did he really get so smashed? He turned on his side, slowly opened his eyes to tumble out of bed in shock. Thump She groggily moaned and turned to face him, her eyes became even more wide than they already were. \"Vi-Victor?!\" she gathered up the blankets to keep herself hidden. He was hallucinating! No, it couldn't be! He didn't! He had slept with Weird Girl! What would Elsa say? No, she couldn't find out! More importantly what would EDGAR do? Victor did practically screw HIS girlfriend! N-no he wouldn't find out as well. \"No one is to know about this.\" Weird Girl, still in shock, nodded in agreement as Victor slipped his pants and shirt on, Weird Girl did the same with her clothes; they both peeked out of the bedroom door, to make sure the coast was clear. Everyone was downstairs, passed out on the floor, sleeping, most with empty wine bottles in their hands. \"Remember, no one is to know!\" and with that Victor and Weird Girl went their separate ways, Victor heading home, hoping his parents wouldn't ask later. Yeah…[Chapter 3] Look! It's a rewrite of chapter 3! YAY And to answer SamAPeace's question, yes I am doctoring this fic up ^_^ Victor groggily turned on his side and looked at his clock. 8 AM in the morning and it felt like his brain was trying to break out of his skull. He learned his lesson to never EVER drink alcohol again, especially wine. It made him wonder if wine was a powerful beverage. And when he woke up to find himself nude with Weird Girl…yeah no more alcohol EVER again. His mother walked in, drawing the curtains, causing a larger headache for the teen. \"Hi honey. How was your date with Elsa?\" Susan asked as Victor remembered his lie. \"It went really well.\" He lied as his mother smiled. \"Sorry your father and I weren't awake to greet you. What time did you come home?\" Victor gave a small thank you prayer in his head. \"A-around ten or ten-thirty.\" As Susan gave a smile, oblivious to what really happened and thinking her son was the greatest in the world. \"Always around curfew!\" she exclaimed, \"Now get ready, I have breakfast waiting!\" as she closed the door. To Victor, it felt as though she had thrown him out of bed and across the room yelling 'Wake up you little bastard! You've got shit to do!' He knew his mother didn't mean it, she didn't know, nor will she EVER know about that party. The party was all the sophomores talked about that Monday, all of them couldn't remember what happened. They just remember waking up with hangovers and a good time. Victor felt a pair of arms wrap around his neck from behind. He turned to his girlfriend. \"Where'd you go, Victor? I looked for you when I woke up but I didn't see you. No one saw you either.\" Victor's heart raced. \"Oh! I left early, you know how strict my parents are.\" She gave an upset look. \"Oh…I see.\" She sounded drifty and sad as if…she knew…Victor felt his heart race, hopefully she didn't know about…that. Elsa gave him a kiss on the lips. \"I have to get to class. I'll see you after.\" Victor blushed. \"O-okay…\" The party talk eventually died down about ten weeks later, and it was about time too. The math class was usually the gossip point since the teacher was slightly deaf and always smacked his hearing aid. But the chit chat was just about life in general, not the party. \"Can anyone solve this equation?\" He asked, turning around, pointing at Weird Girl who had her hand up. \"Ms. Beauclerc?\" he asked as she stood up. \"May I go to the bathroom?\" she asked as he smacked the side of his head where his ear was. \"Could you repeat that?\" \"I asked if I could go to the bathroom.\" He just sighed. \"No, Ms. Beauclerc! You've already been to the bathroom! I know you teens! Trying to skip class.\" He turned his back again to write on the board some more. \"This equation is very simple class, to find the value of X…\" he stopped himself to the sound of retching and a student yelling \"IT GOT ON MY SHOES!\" He turned around to the orange mess on his floor. \"Told you I needed to go…\" Weird Girl said while shivering, the teacher still stood in shock. \"I think…you need to go to the nurse's, Ms. Beauclerc.\" He said pointing to the door as Weird Girl stood up walking out of the classroom. \"Well that was weird.\" Elsa whispered to her boyfriend as Victor nodded. Yeah…the end…of this re-uploaded chapter…[Chapter 4] Chapter four, chapter four, Cass is making chapter four, chapter four while you all review! That's right! I can rap (not really)! Victor sucked on his pen, looking at the scratched out topics for his big paper, so many choices and yet…he gave an agitated sigh. \"Freaking paper.\" He mumbled turning around, falling out of his chair in fear. \"You really should knock.\" He said, scrambling to his feet to get further from the wide-eyed weird girl. \"Victor. We need to talk.\" She sounded sad and dreary compared to her distant sounding voice. \"About?\" Weird Girl just gave a squeeze to her Hello Kitty plushie, her cheeks flushed. \"About the party.\" \"We agreed that it NEVER happened. Remember?\" Tears began to seep from her large, wide eyes. \"But…everyone is going to find out. I…\" She collapsed on her knees, head in her hands as she shook from her sobbing. Victor rose an eyebrow, she was weird alright. What on earth had made her so upset? He wondered this, but she was weird, so it really didn't matter. \"It's the reason I've been very sick lately, I just…I can't.\" \"Poison?\" he asked, as Weird Girl looked up at him as if HE were the strange one. \"Poison? What does poison have to do with us having a baby?\" \"Well I assumed that someone slipped…wait…what?\" Victor silently prayed in his head that she didn't say what he thought she said. \"Due to the…circumstances of that one night, we're going to have…a baby.\" \"We're not having a baby, you and Edgar are now having the baby!\" Weird Girl rose her eyebrow. \"You do realize Edgar is a VERY strict Christian, he would never have sex before marriage. Plus he was never at the party, his parents wouldn't let him go out that night.\" To Victor, the world froze in time. Was this really happening? \"Shit, shit, shit.\" He said through gritted teeth, ruffling his hair in angst. First off what would Elsa say about this? Second what would Edgar do to him? And finally, how was he going to live his life with a baby? \"What am I going to do? How am I going to tell Elsa?\" \"I'm in the same situation. I'm going to be carrying it, and Edgar will be very upset.\" She gave a sigh as she made her way out of his room. It was a good thing too for Victor didn't even want to talk or look at her right now. Just the thought of her taking his virginity made him sick. YAY! It's done! Well this chapter has been re-written. On to the next![Chapter 5] And because I now have a job, chapters are going to come slowly…just a heads up. Victor stood next to his locker with Elsa. She was holding a novel she had to read for English class while her smile illuminated the hallway. To Victor she was the perfect girl, no ifs ands or buts. And if Weird Girl could keep her and Edgar's mouth shut about the kid, all would be well. Victor wouldn't have to worry about explaining the whole situation to his girlfriend. If only life were like that. \"I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!\" Edgar's hunchback shadow emerged from the other hallway as he ran towards Victor his one hand with the long fingers seemed to wrap around Victor's neck twice as the other hand rested over it. \"Next time impregnate YOUR girlfriend, not mine!\" Elsa's eyes widened as she gasped, turning towards her boyfriend with her eyes hidden behind her bangs. Edgar dropped Victor as the teen coughed, trying to catch his breath. Looking up at his pissed of girlfriend. \"You. Did. What. Victor?\" She asked through gritted teeth, her hand raised in an 'I'm-getting-ready-to-smack-you' pose. \"I…I can explain, Elsa!\" he stuttered. SMACK \"Don't even try Victor Edward Frankenstein. We're through.\" And with that she shook her head as tears spilled from her ducts. Everyone began whispering about what happened, and would probably be whispering about it for a few weeks like the party. 'Victor screwed weird girl?' 'When did that happen?' 'I always knew she was a slut.' The room began spinning in front of Victor while the only clear image was of Elsa walking away from him. He began to tear as he turned towards Edgar. \"What the hell, Edgar!?\" \"I should be asking you that!\" Victor just pushed the hunchback teen to the lockers, digging his thumb into his shoulder, Edgar grunted in pain as Victor dropped him. \"I don't have time for you, you waste of life.\" Victor said coldly, walking to his class as Edgar held his shoulder in pain. Weird Girl rushed to him in worrisome, as she looked at Victor stomping away. \"He's going to change…\" Weird Girl whispered as she helped her boyfriend up while tears began to seep from her ducts as well. Look! This is done! XD[Chapter 6] Chapter 6…yeah… Weird Girl tapped the keys on her piano. The big recital was coming up, and she had to write a song, though she couldn't think of anything due to her recent discovery. \"Monica-bug?\" Weird Girl looked up from her piano to the face of her mother who was smiling. \"It's tough isn't it?\" \"Yeah.\" Weird Girl sighed, resting her cheek on her hand. \"You have a while.\" She smiled, \"You'll think of something.\" Her mother lifted herself up as Weird Girl grabbed her hand. \"Mom? You'll love me no matter what, right?\" \"You know I do and always will.\" And with that her mother kissed her cheek. Weird Girl began playing the piano again, she began to hum a jazz-like tune. Victor looked into his closet at his new punk like clothes, red and black with spikes and chains. He was going to change, for the hell of it. He changed into his new clothes, brushing some hair gel in his hair, making it spikey. It was eleven at night and his parents were sleeping. A great opportunity. He quietly tiptoed downstairs and out the front door. \"Hey! It's Victor!\" a jock exclaimed, \"I thought you were a goody…\" \"I changed, Jon. I'm going to say fuck the world.\" \"Cool.\" A bimbo girl said, \"Welcome to the club Victor.\" \"Wait.\" Jon said, \"A little something for your troubles, Victor!\" and with that the jock gave the sophomore a long, slender paper. \"Start slow if it's your first Victor. I learned the hard way.\" Another jock said as he lit up his slender paper. Victor took the cigarette, popping it in his mouth. \"Any of you got a lighter?\" as Jon lit up his paper. Victor took a deep drag, coughing. \"Told ya to start slow.\" The jock laughed as Victor rolled his eyes. \"Fuck that.\" He laughed, taking another drag. This…felt good. He didn't know how or why, but the cigarette relaxed him. \"So, Victor.\" The bimbo girl began, \"Were you high screwing weird girl?\" \"Drunk actually. But I don't give a damn. I'm sticking that kid on Gore and Weirdette.\" \"You really are rebellious.\" She nodded, \"We like it.\" Victor took another drag. \"These are great! How come I didn't know about this shit sooner?\" \"'Cause you were a goody two-shoes.\" The jock laughed, giving Victor a pack. \"This one's on the house, but you'll have to pay for the others.\" Victor stuck the case in his pocket. \"Thanks Jake.\" \"So, Victor. What was it like to lose your virginity for the first time?\" The bimbo asked. \"How the hell should I know, Heather? I was drunk, I don't remember anything, except waking up next to her.\" \"Well when you fuck again, I'll tell ya, it's like fucking heaven.\" Jon said, wrapping his arm around Heather's waist. Victor took another drag, how he would love to take his virginity back and give it to Elsa. But he couldn't, it was impossible. \"I'll see you guys later.\" Victor said, dropping his cigarette, scraping his foot to put it out, heading home, lucky his parents were still asleep at two in the morning. Lalalalala chapter 6! YEAH![Chapter 7] Look! OMFG! It's chapter mofo 7! I take a freaking year! \" Whoooooa. Wh-oa-oao. We've got this lovin' thing goin' on. Where we stay up talkn' all night long. On the phone. 'Cause I don't wanna be alone and… \" Weird Girl sucked on her tongue in a thinking matter. Her song was coming along okay. But she was in a pickle. She tapped the keys of her piano. She needed more lyrics, but nothing came in her head. Looking at her sheet she wrote a few quarter notes and began to tap the keys before scribbling out the notes. She rested her hand on her flat stomach where the new life she was carrying was growing. She gave a smile allowing her tears to spill from her ducts. \" I don't wanna be alone. Just wanna be at home. In your heart. And be a part of this for. Ever and ever and ever and ever. \" Weird Girl began shaking before crying in her hands. \"I'm so sorry.\" She whimpered, giving a hug to her stomach. Victor flicked the lighter a few times before a flame ignited his cigarette. He took a drag, blowing smoke from the window of the attic upstairs. His parents were out on a date for tonight and wouldn't be back until later. \"Victor? I didn't know you smoked.\" He dropped his cigarette out the window as a carton fell from the pocket of his jacket. Crunch \"God dammit!\" he yelled, turning towards Weird Girl. \"What the hell do you want?\" Weird Girl blushed. \"I've been feeling…strange.\" \"You're pregnant. Case closed.\" Victor remarked sarcastically, Weird Girl shook her head. \"And I've read that pregnancy causes the sex drive to increase.\" She continued as though she didn't hear his remark. \"Go screw Edgar.\" \"Victor…I've told you, Edgar's family is Christian. He would never EVER have sex before marriage.\" She sighed, \"YOU'RE the father! You should help!\" and with that she pushed him in a chair and began kissing him. Victor shoved her off of him. \"Get the fuck off of me you freak!\" Weird Girl was taken aback. \"F-freak?\" she began to tear. \"Listen, Weird Girl…\" Victor began annoyed as Weird Girl looked at him with her big eyes. \"Wh-what did you call me?\" she whimpered as her tears spilled faster. \"Why does everyone call me that? Am I really that weird?\" Victor gave an annoyed sniff. \"More than you think.\" Weird Girl slapped Victor across the face. \"You're a dick, Victor Frankenstein!\" She stomped away with tears flying away. \"By the way, my name is Monica!\" she yelled, running away. Victor just rolled his eyes. \"Dunno why you told me that. I don't give a damn what your name is.\" This was going to be a long nine months. Sorry I took FOREVER to update this ;A; I promise I didn't abandon it! The song Monica is singing was written by a friend of mine =3[Chapter 8] Look! It's chapter 8! OMFG! \"Are you ready?\" Edgar asked, squeezing the hand of his girlfriend. \"Yes…no…I don't know.\" Weird Girl sighed, giving a squeeze to her Hello Kitty plushie. She had to tell her mother and father about the baby, and she wanted to do so today. Her heart raced as she twisted the knob of the front door. \"Mom? Dad? I have something important to tell you!\" as a man ran into the room all giddy and excited. \"You broke up with…oh…\" the 'oh' was an oh of disappointment as the man sighed. \"Well it's obviously not good news.\" As the man's face lit up again. \"Wait…you're going to dump Edgar right in front of us!\" \"No, daddy…\" Weird Girl began as her father turned his head to call from behind. \"Marie! Hurry! Our daughter's going to make us proud!\" as a woman walked into the room with a smile on her face. \"What's going on, Hector?\" \"Our little Monica-bug is going to dump Edgar right in front of us!\" the woman's hands reached to her mouth as she gasped in delight, turning her attention to her daughter. \"Aw, honey! Your father and I are so proud of you!\" \"I'm NOT breaking up with Edgar!\" Weird Girl exclaimed as her parents gave a look of disappointment. \"Well it's obviously not too important.\" Hector mumbled to his wife as she nodded, the man gave a glare to poor Edgar. \"I swear, you better have not asked for my little girl's hand in marriage.\" \"Daddy!\" Weird Girl exclaimed as her father sighed. \"Monica, look, your mother and I only want what's best for you!\" Hector's face went white, his eyes narrowed. \" Did he ask for your hand?\" \"No, that wasn't what I wanted to tell you. Now please, listen to me.\" Her parents' eyes were all on her. \"My announcement is not about me breaking up with Edgar, I love him. It's not about Edgar popping the question, we're still too young for that.\" Weird Girl gave a deep sigh. \"I'm pregnant.\" Her parents' faces turned white as their eyes shifted towards Edgar in a way that said 'we'll kill you' \"Marie, get my shotgun.\" As Weird Girl's mother began to walk towards the kitchen. \"Wait!\" Edgar began in fear, \"I'm not even the father!\" \"Victor is the father.\" As Hector's face lit up; he gave a small grin. \"Victor? As in Victor Frankenstein?\" Weird Girl nodded. \"Marie! Scratch that! Get the confetti poppers!\" \"Why?\" Marie called as Hector began dancing. \"Our grandchild is Victor Frankenstein's!\" Marie rushed back in giving her daughter a hug. \"Aw! Monica-bug! We knew you really didn't love Edgar!\" \"Mom! Daddy! You two are so mean!\" Weird Girl began to tear. \"Oh. Hormones, I forgot about those.\" Hector sighed as he smiled, eyeing his wife before looking into his daughters' eyes in proudness. \"So, where is Victor?\" Hector asked, \"I think your mother and I want to hug him right here, right now!\" \"He's not even going to be part of the baby's life! It was all an accident! Do you hear me? Accident!\" Weird Girl sniffed \"Sweetie, going off with someone as handsome and someone who will be successful in the future like Victor, cannot be an accident!\" Marie exclaimed. \"It was, I was just…I was drunk, okay?\" Weird Girl pressed her eyes with the palms of her hands as if trying to push her tears back. \"He's such a jerk now.\" She sniffed, \"Everyone is a jerk.\" She ran out of the room, sobbing. Her tears cascaded and flew from her face. She hated the world, she hated everyone… Well almost everyone… She shut the door of her room, sitting on her bed. She took one of her 'Hello Kitty' stuffed toys and began hugging it. She overheard her father ask Edgar if there was anywhere else he needed to be besides here. Her parents hated Edgar, ever since they began dating. Hell, probably before they began dating. They'd hate Victor too once they saw how big of a jerk he is now. She hated Victor, hated everything about him… Well almost everything… The only thing she liked about that jerk was he was the one who gave her, her baby. She just hoped her baby looked nothing like him. A knock erupted on her door as her mother stepped in. \"Monica-bug?\" she asked, sitting next to her child as Weird Girl looked away. \"I know this is hard, you're still very young. But look on the Brightside! It's Victor's baby! Which means it'll be…\" but her daughter interrupted her in a pissed off tone. \"It's not Victor's baby! It's my baby! He might have helped make it, but it's mine! Never his!\" Weird Girl began to sob heavily, digging her face into her plushie. If Victor didn't want to be a part of her baby's life, then so be it. She could take care of her baby by herself, and she knew Edgar would help and be more of a father than Victor. Yeah, I needed to update this…but I was lazy…O= so huzzah I updated.[Chapter 9] I'm going to try to keep on top of this…/dies/ \"Damn, Victor!\" Jon exclaimed, \"You smoked that whole pack in one day?\" Victor rolled his eyes. \"No, Jon. I didn't smoke it all in one day, the freak of nature surprised me and caused me to drop a perfectly good cigarette out the window and step on the still full pack.\" Victor handed the jock a 5 dollar bill as Jon pulled out an unopened case of cigarettes from his jacket. Victor unwrapped the plastic, opening the cardboard top and pulling out the long, slender paper; popping it in his mouth. He flipped his lighter open, igniting the flame. He took a deep drag, exhaling from his nostrils. \"God I needed that.\" He sighed, to Victor a whole weekend without a cigarette made him very moody. It was as though the slender paper was his medicine, a ticket to relaxation. The two teens stayed behind the school warehouse until Victor finished his cigarette, throwing it on the concrete ground, scraping his shoe on the cigarette butt. \"I'm off to class. I'll see you around.\" He stuffed the case into his backpack, zipping it up tightly. A blonde bimbo in her senior year of high school gasped in delight at the juicy gossip her friend whispered in her ear. She turned her gaze onto Weird Girl making her way towards the wide-eyed girl; her hips swung with the click of her heels, and with every step her bosom jiggled as well. \"I heard the rumor, Weirdette! Such a shame I was gone last week and only heard about it today.\" Weird Girl looked down, clinging her books tightly to her chest. \"What do you want, Catherine?\" Weird Girl asked, not turning away from her locker to avoid eye contact with the bully. \"What do I want?\" she asked with a laugh, \"Well I don't want anything but I do want to clarify what I just heard.\" Catherine began snickering, tossing one of her pigtails. \"Well, out with it!\" Weird Girl spat in impatience. \"You're pregnant! And Edgar's not even the father? I always knew you were a little slut.\" Catherine sighed in a bitchy tone, causing Weird Girl to tear up. \"Frankenstein must've been high to screw you, Weird Girl, or should we call you Slut Freak now?\" \"Leave her alone, Catherine.\" Weird Girl turned around to see who was defending her, someone who she didn't think would defend her or anyone for that matter…Catherine's eyes widened as she gave a glare towards Weird Girl, strutting her way back towards her friends. \"Thanks, Nassor.\" Weird Girl said in a soft tone as the lanky teen pulled his hand up to stop her from speaking. \"Don't…\" he began in his nonchalant tone, \"I just hate how Catherine can't look in a mirror. But you are rather stupid for going to that party, I won't lie.\" Weird Girl blinked a few times. \"Oh, right. You weren't there.\" Nassor just made a hmph sound through his nostrils. \"Why would I go to such a foolish event? I would gain nothing from going and losing my common sense.\" He turned to look at the wide-eyed girl. \"So why did you go?\" he asked as Weird Girl hugged her textbook. \"I…I just…wanted to have fun and be an adult for a day…\" \"You apparently didn't think of the consequences…\" Nassor said cooly as Weird Girl shook her head. \"How far along are you?\" He asked as Weird Girl hugged her books tighter. \"Almost twelve weeks…\" \"Well, I wish you luck. Good day.\" And with that Nassor turned on his heels, walking away. Weird Girl blinked at him before turning in the other direction towards her art class, feeling cold glares from almost everyone's stone eyes. Victor twirled a pen in boredom during math, and no matter how much he tried he could still see Elsa's sparkling green eyes in his head. He wanted to get over her, maybe date…Catherine? She was popular and hot. But wasn't she dating someone from another school? He didn't know, he just needed to get over Elsa. Hell, he'd date anyone…well anyone except Weirdette. He could never forgive himself for losing his virginity to her, just the thought that she was carrying his child made him hope that something horrible would happen to it. He hated that child. If that child were Elsa's he'd love it…but it wasn't Elsa's and that's what made Victor upset the most. \"Mr. Frankenstein! Please pay attention! This will be on the test!\" Victor snapped out of his trance, his math teacher's hands were on her hips as she gave an upset look. \"Sorry Mrs. Bree.\" He sighed, giggles erupted as the teacher went back to the blackboard, writing something about fractions that Victor didn't care to pay attention to. So what if he fails math? He didn't care, at least not anymore. All because he had to be a drunken moron. And yeah…chapter 9 is DONE! Going to work on ch. 10…[Chapter 10] I just…need to be on this fanfic! Weird Girl's stomach grew and grew, so did the whispers behind her back. She was twenty weeks along and was still being judged for losing her virginity to someone who was not her boyfriend. However, this didn't matter to her, her boyfriend still loved her through all of her mistakes! Edgar was the baby's father, even though he didn't make the baby, he loved it…just like she loved it! \"I'm excited.\" She blurted out, today was the day she would find out her baby's gender! She squeezed her Hello Kitty plushie as her baby moved slightly. \"I think baby is excited too!\" she exclaimed as a group of teens began to giggle, obviously at her, whispering slut in each other's ears. Victor looked up from his locker, Elsa was passing him with her girlfriends; but she didn't lay an eye on her ex-boyfriend. \"Fucking kid.\" Victor mumbled, everything was that damn kid's fault! If only Weirdette didn't get pregnant or if she had gotten a fucking abortion everything would've been hunky dory! But no , she had to tell that retard! That deformed retard who can't keep his mouth shut! He didn't know why this still bothered him…Elsa was gone but he didn't want it to be true…he was going to win Elsa back even if it killed him! No matter what he would always love that woman. Victor sat by himself at the back of the school, smoking a cigarette, flicking the ashes off of his slender paper. \"Victor?\" Victor gritted his teeth at the voice. \"Don't talk to me…I don't have business with whores.\" He inhaled his cigarette, exhaling through his nostrils. \"I could say the same to you, asshole!\" she exclaimed before calming down, \"but I want to ask a question.\" Victor gave an annoyed sigh. \"As long as it's not a plea to take care of… that .\" Victor pointed to her stomach, saying that in a disgusted way, \"I'll listen.\" \"Oh, wow, you'll listen?!\" Weird Girl said in a sarcastic tone. \"Just ask your question, and leave!\" Weird Girl was taken aback. \"Alright…why did you do it? With me?\" Victor shuddered at her question. \"Well, you were extremely drunk, I don't see how you would mistake someone as handsome as me for some ass-ugly, deformed… thing , like Edgar.\" \"For one, I was talking about you! And two, don't you dare say anything harsh about Edgar! He's more of the baby's father than you are!\" \"So be it! But to answer that, I was drunk like you were, I probably had mistaken you for Elsa…though I'm not sure how, Elsa is ten times more gorgeous than you are, I guess booze fucks with the brain.\" Victor inhaled his cigarette. \"Now if you don't have anything important to say, leave.\" Victor spat as Weird Girl gave a hmph from her mouth, stomping away. \"There you are Monica-bug!\" Marie exclaimed, \"Hurry now, your appointment's in twenty-five minutes!\" Weird Girl sighed, hopping in the car as she and her mother drove away. \"You find out what my grandchild is today! Are you excited?\" Weird Girl smiled. \"I am very excited, mom!\" Though the wide eyed girl was excited, she was still slightly embarrassed for walking up to Victor just to ask him a stupid question about something that didn't even matter. \"Alright, Monica.\" The doctor began, \"The heart sounds good, but I'm betting you want to know the sex, right?\" \"I do, yes!\" Weird Girl exclaimed as she hugged herself. \"Well, you're going to have a daughter!\" Weird Girl felt a sense of happiness, she really wanted a little girl, and had the perfect name for her beloved daughter. \"I'm very happy to see you're doing well, Amy!\" she exclaimed, looking over at the monitor, the silhouette of her baby kicking her legs and moving around brought a smile to the young mother's face. \"Well, Ms. Beauclerc…Everything is good, I'll call you later to set up another appointment.\" Weird Girl blushed, picking up her Hello Kitty tote she walked out of the office with her mother and a smile on her face. She couldn't wait to tell Edgar that the baby was a girl! Yeah…not very good, it was 1 am when I wrote this XD I'm tired! I need to be on this ficcy…yup…I'll TRY to update chapter 11 sooner…[Chapter 11] Oh look, chapter 11! YAY Beat on the brat, beat on the brat, beat on the brat with a baseball bat. Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh. Victor blared his CD player louder as he bobbed his head to The Ramones. He grabbed his carton of cigarettes, opening the window of the empty classroom he was in, he turned around, looking at the closed door to make sure the coast was clear, he was skipping his English class today because he needed his cigarettes, he flicked the lighter as he lit his cigarette, taking a drag, exhaling from his nostrils. \"Hey Victor!\" Victor jumped, dropping his cigarette as he turned around, he groaned, stopping his CD player, pulling his headphones off. \"Dammit, Heather! You made me drop a perfectly good cigarette!\" The girl laughed pulling a carton from her jacket, giving a slender paper to Victor. \"Here, this one's on the house.\" She opened the other window, lighting her cigarette. Victor did the same with his slender paper. It was silent for a few moments, before Victor broke it. \"So how'd you know I was here?\" Heather looked over at him, a questioning look on her face. \"I didn't, I just know this classroom is empty and I sought the opportunity for a smoke break.\" Victor gave a nod. It was silent for a second. \"Did you hear?\" Heather asked as Victor gave a hm? From his lips. \"Catherine broke up with her boyfriend! And I think she kind of likes you, dude. I mean ever since you stopped being a goody little bastard she's been admiring you from afar.\" \"Really?\" Victor asked as he shrugged, \"Maybe I'll ask her out.\" \"You should, she's good in bed too!\" Victor looked over at Heather with a shocked look on his face. \"Have people told you she's good?\" Heather laughed. \"That, and I've experienced it.\" \"What?!\" Victor asked shocked as Heather laughed, she took a drag of her cigarette. \"Jon wanted me to have girl on girl action for his pleasure, so I kissed her, fondled with her a bit, one thing led to another and we fucked. She was better than Jon, and that should tell you something.\" Heather giggled. \"Jon was actually turned on by the fact I slept with Catherine that he couldn't keep his hands off of me for a week!\" Heather turned her attention to Victor, \"Maybe she can take your second virginity.\" Victor just rolled his eyes. \"Can she take my virginity back from Weird Bitch?\" Heather rolled her eyes. \"I don't think any one wants to screw her, except maybe her freakish boyfriend.\" Victor sighed as Heather looked over with a compassionate expression. \"Hey, you might have lost your virginity to her, but you were wasted, I wouldn't count that.\" \"I just wish it was with Elsa…\" \"Your ex?\" Heather asked as Victor nodded, Heather looked down. \"You really liked her, didn't you?\" \"I loved her…I just…wish she'd forgive me.\" Victor took another drag from his cigarette. \"Maybe dating Catherine will get your mind off of her.\" Heather suggested as Victor dropped his cigarette butt out of the window. \"Maybe. Hell, I'll go ask her now.\" As Victor gave a wave to Heather, leaving the room. \"Yeah! I'd love to go out with you, Victor!\" Catherine exclaimed, giving Victor a kiss on his lips. \"But we'll have to lay off sex for a while, you stud.\" She giggled, \"I need to get a new prescription of birth control. We don't want what happened to Weird Slut, happen to me, right?\" Victor rolled his eyes. \"Don't remind me of that. It sickens me that she took my virginity.\" \"Sorry, babe.\" Weird Girl slammed her locker shut, jumping slightly at Toshiaki's face. \"Ye-yes?\" She asked as Toshiaki blushed, handing her a VHS tape, she rose her eyebrow in confusion. \"It's uhm…it's a tape of you and Victor…\" \"Stop right there, Toshiaki…\" Weird Girl blushed, tears began to form in her eyes. \"I thought you should have it to…you know…get rid of, honestly, I've watched it about thirty times.\" \"You watched it?!\" Weird Girl was shocked. \"I…I wanted to know what I filmed the night of the party…\" \"But thirty times?\" Toshiaki was silent for a moment. \"It might have been more…It was…kind of a turn on…\" Toshiaki blushed. \"I…didn't know you were that…pretty…Victor was lucky to have…y-you know.\" Weird Girl blushed, she was unsure if she should take the compliment, or be offended. \"And…g-good luck with the baby.\" Toshiaki turned on his heels, rushing the opposite direction, though his back was turned, Weird Girl could tell he was blushing. \"What was that all about?\" Edgar asked, as Weird Girl smiled, giving her boyfriend a peck on the cheek. \"Toshiaki was kind enough to give me a tape for me to burn.\" \"Why would you burn a perfectly good tape?\" Edgar asked in confusion as Weird Girl blushed. \"It's the tape of me and Victor…\" she couldn't finish her sentence before the tears started flowing. \"Wait…he filmed that?! I knew he was a pervert, but geez.\" Edgar rolled his eyes as Weird Girl kept on sniffling. \"H-hey!\" Edgar began, putting a comforting hand on his girlfriend's shoulder \"Amy wouldn't want her mommy to be sad!\" Weird Girl wiped her eyes with the back of her hand and smiled. \"You're right.\" She squeezed her growing belly, if it weren't for her and Victor's drunken one night stand, her baby wouldn't be here! And she was very thankful for that. I love you, Amy. Weird Girl thought to herself, I love you.

Unknowinglyrnto him, he was being followed by a small yellow sub.xa0 The small sub pasted the rudder of the nuclear sub and now wasrnridding beside it.xa0 Moments later itrnmoved above it as it was now over the top hatch.xa0 The yellow sub clung on the other sub as inside UR-IM28 twornsailors stopped dead in their tracks. \"Whatrnwas that?\" One sailor asked in Russian to his comrade. \"Irndon't know,\" Replied in Russian, \"Sounded like a clank.\" Theyrnthen heard another sound from above as they looked up.xa0 Suddenly the hatch opened as eight gallonsrnof water poured in other them as they screamed.xa0 They both were knocked out as a man in a wet suit dropped down besidernthem.xa0 He took off his mask and put on arnpair of black glasses.xa0 He was knownrnaround the world as the international man of mystery, Austin Powers.xa0 He armed him self and looked at the twornsailors. \"Irnhope you don't mind if I dropped in on you?\" He joked as headed towards thernbridge. Hernedged his way in as he saw another door head that was ajar.xa0 He stopped as he heard someone speaking inrnRussian obviously it was Captain Tannielof addressing his men.xa0 Austin, knowing how to speak in Russian, hernlistened in on his speech. \"Myrnbeloved loyal crew,\" He started, \"In two hours we will reach over the bordersrnof the United States.xa0 We will take backrnof what they stolen from us.xa0 Our firstrntarget will be the city of San Francisco.xa0rnThere are almost about four million jobs and soon there will bernnone.\" Austinrncouldn't take it anymore, He kick the door open and at the same time knockedrnout another sailor.xa0 He pointed his gunrnat the captain as he entered. \"Alright,rnnobody Move!\" He ordered as Tannielof turned around to confront Austin,rn\"Alright Captain N. Tanniel…off.xa0 Yourrnraid is over.xa0 Turn your sub around andrnhead back to your motherland.\" \"Ah,rnMr. Powers,\" Tanniel stated, \"International man of mystery.xa0 I am pleased to meet you, Unfortunaly werncannot deviate from our destination.\"xa0rnAustin then heard clicking of gun shafts behind him.xa0 Tannielof smiled as there were three gunsrnaimed at Austin. \"And we cannot have you interfering.xa0 Take Mr. Powers to the brig. \" Justrnwhen a sailor guard placed his hand on Austin's shoulder, he grabbed his handrnand shouted, \"Judo flip!\"xa0 He flippedrnhim on the ground then he took a shot at the captain, but he ducked out of thernway as the bullet ricocheted all over the bridge as Austin, Tannielof and hernrest of the crew followed the bullet's path until it hit the submarine's pilot.xa0 The pilot leaned forward as he fell on therncontrols dead.xa0 The submarine shifted asrnit dove at an angle down towards the bottom of the sea. Everyone on thernbridge fell forward as one sailor cried in Russian, \"Every Comrade for himrnself!\" He and the rest ofrnthe crew mobbed through the door as Austin grabbed Tannielof. \"You fool,\"rnTannielof said to Austin, \"Do you realized what you've done?xa0 We'll all die!\" \"Oh no baby,\" SaidrnAustin, \"As everybody knows I never die, Twice in one movie.\" \"So, how did yournescape the sub?\" A female voice asked. Austin wasrnentertaining one of his female guest a blond English woman.xa0 They were in his bed after a long intimaternshagfest at his pad.xa0 Austin turned tornher smiling. \"Well baby.xa0 After I detained the Russian bloke, I ran inrnto the rear of the sub and torpedoed my way to the surface,\" He explained. \"Oh wow,\" shernsaid, \"That must be dangerous.\" \"Danger'srnmy middle name baby,\" he remarked. \"Howrndo you do it?\" She wondered, \"You risk your life day after day, not knowingrnthat you'll live through it.xa0 What'srnyour secret?\" Austinrngrinned at her and replied, \"That's easy baby, its mojo power.xa0 Here I'll show you.\" Herntook his girlfriend's and they both got up naked as the music of Quincy Jonesrnfilled the flat.xa0 They danced into thernliving room and out the front door.xa0rnAustin and his lover, bopped down the hall as everyone opened theirrndoors to see what was going on then they joined in the fun, as they were alsornnaked.xa0 They skipped down the stairsrnuntil they got to the lobby.

Somewhere over Asia… Highrnabove the clouds over the Asia continent floated a huge air ship in the shapernof Dr. Evil.xa0 It was flying because ofrnfour giant propellers on top of it spinning madly.xa0xa0 Deep inside in the main chamber five people were sitting aroundrna long square table.xa0 Frau Farbissinarnwas sitting opposite to Number Two.xa0rnNext to Frau sat a bald young man, dressed in black, Dr. Evil's son,rnScott Evil. xa0The other two loyal menrnwere sitting at the other end of the table.xa0rnThey were all waiting as the door on the other side of the room slidrnopened and stood two bald men, Dr. Evil him self and his short clone counterrnpart, Mini Me. He and Mini Me walked over as Dr. Evilrngreeted them, \"Welcome everyone to my floating air ship.\" \"Holdrnon,\" Scott butted in, \"I thought you were working for good?\" \"WellrnScott, once your evil, there is no turning back,\" He answered. \"Now, Number Twornhow's Verticom doing?\" \"Dr. Evil, we haverninvested and brought a jet airline company called Jet Blue.\" The one eyernhenchman explained, \"In one year we have grossed over two billon dollars inrnsales alone.\" Dr. Evil nodded to him,xa0 \"Really? Well, while I was in jail for a fewrnmonths, Mini Me and I came up with a great plan for world domination.xa0 As you know the World Trade Center in NewrnYork City controls the trading for the entire world.xa0 Here the plan, we Hijack two plans and smashing them in the tworntowers, unless New York pay us a king's ransom?\" Number Two gruntedrnas Dr. Evil turned to him wondering what was wrong, \"That has happened.\" \"Really?\" Dr. Evilrnasked as Number Two nodded, \"Ook, see, they never let us watch TV in jail.

Not at that point anyways.xa0 He thought of pulling over the road and bailrnout of this mission, but he didn't.xa0 Hernwas so confused, and he needed to talk to her at the next stop. Theyrnjust passed the Oregon state border and saw Fat Bastard turn in to arnMcDonalds.xa0 He wanted to go to therndrive-thru but the truck was too big so he parked on the lot.xa0 Titti was awake as Austin parked on thernother side. \"TittirnI must talk to you,\" He said, \"I don't think I can do this.xa0 Being a secret agent.\" \"Whyrnnot?\" She asked as she unbuckled her seatbelt. \"Itrndoesn't feel right for me.xa0 I mean allrnthis spying around, its just, its not me.xa0rnI'm sorry but I think I like to bail out.\" \"Austin,rnlook, I know you don't know who you are or what you do, but let me tell yournthis.xa0 I have seen you in action and yournare a spy.xa0 If you bail out now, you andrnthe entire population of the earth will never see the light of day, and Dr.rnEvil will rule the world.xa0 Do you wantrnthat to happen?\" \"No,\"rnHe replied slowly as if he was unsure. \"Butrnif you want to bail out, go ahead.xa0 I'llrnstop Dr. Evil my self.\" Hernlooked at her and knew she was right.xa0rnHe couldn't let her go after those nut cases by her self.xa0 She'll need help.xa0 His help. \"Alright,rnlets stop that egghead,\" he said, this time with confidence. Theyrnwent to the drive-thru and ordered a couple of Big Macs, a Coke and waitedrnuntil Fat Bastard came out of the fast food restaurant.xa0 He want back to his truck and drove off asrnAustin again followed him. A Secret Check Point in Washington… FatrnBastard finally stopped at a hidden checkpoint somewhere in the woods ofrnWashington.xa0 Austin and Titti hid theirrncar behind a bush got out and carefully walked over to see Fat Bastard'srntruck.xa0 A guard came over to him as FatrnBastard looked down from the window. \"Letsrnsneak on board and see where it goes,\" Titti whispered as Austin nodded. Theyrnboth got on the back of the truck's dumper and the truck went off again.xa0 They entered a huge manmade tunnel and drovernabout a half a mile before it stopped.xa0rnTitti an Austin jumped off and hid behind a few crates as they saw whatrnwas happening.xa0 They were in a huge roomrnthe size of a small hanger as worker crossed each other as they walked by.xa0 The middle of the room was Titti and Austin'srnattraction, a huge object shaped like a ring.xa0rnAround the ring was decorated with hieroglyphics markings that indicatedrnthat the object was from Egypt. \"Irnknew it,\" Titti said, \"That's Ramses' Gate.xa0rnIt was stolen from the Cairo Museum a few weeks ago.xa0 That is one of the reasons I volunteered forrnthis assignment.xa0 It was said that itrnwas used to teleport Ramses through time, but that was just myth.xa0 Dr. Evil must of used it to base on his TimernMachine.\" FatrnBastard got out of the cab of the truck as Scott Evil and Sil approached him. \"Alright,rnhere's your sail,\" Fat Bastard said, \"Now where's my money?\" \"Yourrndelivery isn't complete Fat Bastard,\" Scott replied, \"Your money is in Ciro,rnEgypt 1981.xa0 Where my father is rightrnnow. Here's the plan.\" He quoted 'Plan' as he continued, \"We've just discoveredrnhow this thing works.xa0 We will usernRamses' Gate.\" He quoted Ramses's Gate, \"to teleport you and the truck back torn1981.xa0 Now did anyone follow you?\" \"Arernyou kiddin'\" Fat Bastard replied, \"I am slier then a fox.xa0 I have hearin' like jackrabbits.xa0 Now, where's your crapper? I got to take arnlea-.\" \"Aright,rnenough!\"xa0 Scott interrupted. \"Its downrnthe hall on your right.\"xa0 He looked tornSil as Fat bastard waddled away. \"Love,\"rnSil asked to Scott, \"What about Austin Powers?\" \"NowrnSil.xa0 Are you sure Austin lost all ofrnhis memory?\" He asked. \"Well...\"rnShe replied, \"I think the erasure was complete, that until that bitch came inrnand interrupted it.\" \"Ok,rnno problem, we just have to kill him. And I have just the man to do it.\" Austinrnlooked to Titti for a plan as Titti looked back hoping he had one, butrnunfortunate he did not.xa0 The fate of thernworld lies on him and he didn't have a simple plan to stop all this. \"Well,\"rnTitti started, \"we can sneak back on the truck and stop Dr. Evil in the past.\" \"Thatrnsound like a good plan.\"xa0 Austin repliedrnquietly, \"But do you think that this gate really works?\" \"Irndon't know,\" she replied unsurely. Asrnsoon as the coast was clear they carefully crept towards the side of the truck,rnmaking sure no one spotted them.xa0 Theyrnboth climbed on the side and in the dumper it self.xa0 Meanwhile Fat Bastard retuned, climbed in to the cab as Scottrnreturned with a tall man who has a metal plate around his mouth.xa0 It looked like a bear trap with tough stealrnsharp teeth. \"Alright,rnactivate the Gate!\" Scott ordered. \"ACTIVATErnTHE GATE!\" Frau repeated as Scott Jumped. Therninner circle swirled counter-clockwise and a wave of water like substancernswirled inward like a whirlpool.xa0rnEveryone looked at in awe. \"OkrnPiranha,\" Scott said to him, \"You know that to do. If you see Austin, Killrnhim.\" SuddenlyrnPiranha looked up and saw a head with rimmed glassed on the truck and hisrnmouthpiece clattered up and down as he pointed. \"What?\"rnScott asked, \"What is it? Will you stop clattering and tell me?\"xa0 Piranha turned Scott's head and he sawrnAustin plop down as the truck started up and drove on the ramp towards thernGate.xa0 \"Stop!xa0 Someone Stop that Truck!\" But it was too late. Piranharnran towards the dump tuck and jumped on the back as it entered the gate.xa0 The truck and all aboard were stretched andrnswirled with the water like substance and disappeared.[Chapter 5] Chapterrn5 Somewhere in Egypt 1981… In a room decorated withrnhieroglyphics, sat Ramsey's Gate.xa0 Thenrnit came alive, glowing and swirling, the huge truck witch Fat Bastard wasrndriving, came through.xa0 He drove it offrnthe ramp and parked it as he got out.xa0 Meanwhile,rnPiranha, fell off the truck feeling dizzy and completely disoriented.xa0 Fat Bastard looked over as Piranha stumbledrntowards him. \"Ach.rnYe don look to good.\" He said to him, \"Well, I got to tell Dr. Evil That I'mrnhere. See ye later.\" FatrnBastard walked off and closed the door.xa0rnThis was the perfect opportunity for Austin and Titti to make theirrnmove.xa0 They climbed out of the truck,rnbut Piranha got to his senses and saw them.xa0rnHe chomped his metal teeth coming towards them.xa0 Titti looked about and saw a pile of boxesrnon the corner wall.xa0 She tugged Austinrnover as they hid behind it.xa0 Piranharnknew there they were and followed them, but suddenly the pile of boxes fell on toprnof him knocking Piranha out. \"Well,rnit seems he has a lot on his mind,\" Austin Joked, \"I guess he's kind of boxedrnin at the time.\" \"Right,rncome on, we got to get out of here.\" Titti said as they headed toward the door,rnbut it was electronically locked from the other side. \"Crap, we're locked in,rntrapped.\" Austinrnlooked about and saw a window high above them that was close to the ceiling.rnThen he had an idea.xa0 He started to makerna ladder from the remaining boxes.xa0rnTitti smiled at him as they climbed out and just in time too.xa0 Piranha came to his senses, got up from thernpile and saw them climb through the window.xa0rnHe will get them soon. Therntwo agents entered a horrific sandstorm as they ran into the hot windyrnstorm.xa0 They weren't sure where theyrncame from or if they will ever find Dr. Evil's new Headquarters again.xa0 A couple of hours have passed as they hikedrnin the endless Sahara. It seemed that the storm will never end and all hope wasrnlost.xa0 Titti couldn't take another steprnas she fell on to the sand. \"Titti,\"rnAustin gasped as he too was totally exhausted and collapsed. \"Only a miraclerncould save… us..now…\" Just then, Austin swore he heard thumpingrnnoise just as he drift into unconscious. Meanwhilernback into Dr. Evil's Headquarters…Dr. Evil selected an area in the ancientrnEgyptian tomb of witch to set up his main chamber.xa0 The chamber, like the other parts of the tombs had colorfulrnhieroglyphics, and Egyptian statues and pottery.xa0 But it was also the pharos's throne room, which Dr. Evilrnenjoyed.xa0 Though he just improvised itrnwith modern furniture and electronics. \"Welcomernevery one to my underground pyramid lair,\" Dr. Evil announced. \"Right now as wernspeak, my son, in the future, has used the sun shield to blackmail the entirernEarth.xa0 But here in the 80's our job isrnfar from over.xa0 Thanks to Mr. Baits andrnFat Bastard we now have the sail to cover the parameter of the sun.\"xa0 He turned and looked at an Arab sitting atrnthe corner of a square table where his other regular henchman sat as well,xa0xa0 \"Mr. Husah you are a leading terrorist inrnthe world today by night, but by day you are richest iron and gold minor inrnEgypt.xa0 How goes the construction dog?\" \"Dog?\"rnthe Arab questioned raising a brow. \"Are you trying to insult me?\" \"Notrnthat I know of posse,\" he replied. \"So what is the word bro?\" \"Word?rnPosse? I am sorry Dr. Evil I am not understanding your language.\" Mr. Husah,rn\"But perhaps we should get down to business, like my payment.\" \"Payment?\"rnDr. Evil wondered,\" Ok, two things, one, from now on I like you to refer me asrnPharaoh Evil.xa0 Yes, that would bernappropriate.xa0 The new king is inrntown.xa0 As for your pay, well you willrnget it time.xa0 As I understand fromrnPiranha that my dear brother Austin Powers is here.\" \"Dornyou want him dead?\" Mr. Husah inquired. \"If so my best assassin will take carernof it.\"xa0 He motioned his hand and man inrna red fez came forward. \"I think you know him, Mustafa.\" \"No,rnhe is my brother, just get him out of the way for now.\" \"Asrnyou wish my king\" Cairo Egypt… Austinrnopened his eyes to find himself in a room.xa0rnHe saw a door on the far side, a dresser next to it and a mirror on toprnof the dresser.xa0 He then realized hernwasn't in a hospital room, but in a hotel of some sort.xa0 He placed on his glasses for a clearer lookrnand heard a shower from behind a door next and across the room fromrnhimself.xa0 He wondered whom it was as thernsound of the shower silenced.xa0 Momentsrnlater the door opened and it was Titti in robe with a towel wrapped around herrnhair. \"Well,rngood morning Austin, \" She smiled, \"I was wondering when you will wake.\" \"WhatrnHappened? Where are we?\" Austin perplexed as he was asked her. \"We'rernin Cairo.xa0 A hotel actually.\" Shernreplied sitting on the bed. \"Howrndid we get here?\" He asked again. \"WhenrnI woke an hour ago one of my contacts found us and brought us here.xa0 We were lucky when he came looking for us.rnAnother minute and that sandstorm would've buried us alive,\" She replied. \"Sornnow what?\" Austin wondered,xa0 \"I'm surernthat storm buried that window for us to find again.\" \"Don'trnworry, my contact told me some information on a man who knows the location,\"rnShe responded, \"The problem is the man we are looking for is dangerous manrnnamed Huspanaduan Hasah.\" \"WellrnI wouldn't worry Danger's my middle name, I think\" Tittirnsmiled at him, \"You know Austin, ever since I met you didn't sound like the manrnI read in the files.xa0 I like that, a manrnof mystery.\"xa0 She came closer to him. \"Shouldn'trnwe find Mr. Husah?\" Austin asked as Titti was face to face to him. \"Irnknow where exactly he is.\" She said softly, \"He owns a night club in townrncalled the Humping Camel, which doesn't open until four hours from now.xa0 Plenty of time to, get to know each otherrnmore.\" Withrnthat they kissed with passion and made love.xa0rnAustin then finally remembered when the last time he made love tornanother women.xa0 He remembered the 60'srnthe 70's, but not the 80's, not yet anyways.xa0rnHe remembered that he had a brother, named Dougie Powers aka Dr.rnEvil.xa0 He remembered everything. \"Irnremember everything!\" he exclaimed as he sat up from his frolicking with Titti. Backrnin Dr. er I mean Pharaoh Evil's lair, Pharaoh Evil and his Mini Me was in thernrecreation room playing table hokey. \"That'srnit Mini Me,\" Evil said, \"no Mr. Nice pharaoh\" Withrnthe flick of the wrist Pharaoh Evil scored. \"Yes!rnWho's your daddy? Huh who's your daddy, oh yes that would be me huh?\" SuddenlyrnNumber 2 entered and reported. \"Whatrnis it Number 2?\" \"Thernconstruction on the first one is finish.\" \"Good,rnonce we all four completed, there will be no one stopping us.\" Evil said, \"Norneven by brother, Austin Powers. Mauw Ha Ha MAUW HAHA.\" They laughed until MinirnMe tugged on his taller counterpart's leg. Evil looked down as Mini Me held uprntwo fingers in one hand and three on the other. \"Ohrnyou want a rematch huh?\" Evil asked as Mini Me nodded, \"Ok you're on.\" He lookedrnto Number 2 \"You can have winners.\" \"Uh,rnactually I more work to be done, excuse me, \" Number 2 told them as he bowedrnand left. \"Well,rndon't forget! All work and no play…Oh hell with him,\" he said as looked to MinirnMe, \"Come Mini Me!\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 The Humping Camel Austinrnand Titti arrived around 7:00PM, they were both dressed at their best.xa0 Austin wearing his Blue and red strippedrnsuit and Titti wearing a stunning black lace dress.xa0 As they entered the club, Titta looked around, as didrnAustin.xa0 The club was decorated withrncolorful beads draping in the arches and Arabic music playing the background. \"Wellrnwhat do you think?\" Titti wondered \"Well,rnthe décor is horrid, and the music is ungroovie baby,\" Austin replied. \"No,rnI mean where do you think, Mr. Husah is?\" She asked him. Austinrnlooked around as so did Titti.xa0 ThenrnTitti looked upward towards the loft of the club.xa0 She saw four men including one she recognized. \"Therernhe is,\" She said as Austin look towards her gaze.xa0 They then looked at a staircase in the corner that led to thernloft.xa0 But unfortunately it was guardedrnby one of Mr. Husah's thug.xa0 \"How are werngoing to pass him?\" \"Alright,rnI have a plan,\" Austin started, \"You go find me a long rope and hacksaw, then Irnclimb out side onto the roof, and crash through the ceiling window.xa0 You saw the supports that, supports the loftrnand that would crash down.\" \"Well,rnthat's a good plan,\" She said, \"But how's this, I'll go over and distract himrnand you go upstairs and talk to Mr. Husah.\" \"Right,rnThat would work,\" he replied. Tittirnlooked towards the guard and suddenly walked slowly towards the man.xa0 She looked like a sexual tiger walkingrntowards her mate. Austin looked at her and started to get turned on. \"YeahrnBaby,\" He mumbled. Tittirnworked her body as the guard took notice.xa0rnHe grinned at her as she came forward. \"Excusernme big boy, but you know where I can…\" She whispered something dirty in his earrnand the man smiled even wider, then the man shook his head. \"Irnmust stay at my post,\" He said. \"Really?xa0 Even for…\" She whispered again. Thernguard had a hard decision to make then said, \"Well, alright, but just a fewrnminutes.\"xa0 Then she and the guard leftrntowards the side door.xa0 This wasrnAustin's perfect time to visit Mr. Husah. xa0He went up the steps and saw him sitting with his associates. \"…AndrnI hope he knows what he is doing.\" He ended.xa0rnHe looked up and saw Austin, \"Who are you?xa0 How did you get pass my guard?\" \"Thernname's Powers, Austin Powers.\" Austin introduced. \"Whatrndo you want, Mr. Powers?\" Mr. Husah wondered. \"Worldrnpeace, A couple of girls to shag by,\" He replied, \"That sort of stuff.\" \"Irnmean, why are you here?\" Mr. Husah asked again. \"Irnheard you know some one who knows something about a sail,\" He replied. \"Irnheard nothing of a sail, and if I did, why should I tell you?\" Mr. Husah wondered, \"Who are you? CIA?rnFBI? British Intelligence?\" Austinrnreplied, \"Actually I'm a Man of International Mystery baby yeah.xa0 And I'm looking for a man.xa0 A man named Dr. Evil.xa0 You know him?\" \"Dr.rnEvil?xa0 Never heard of him,\" Mr. Husahrnlied, \"Now if you excuse me,\" he said getting up, \"I have other business tornattend to.xa0 Have a pleasant stay Mr.rnPowers.\" Hernand his associates got up too and went back down stairs.xa0 Austin knew that Mr. Husah was lying.xa0 He now has to follow him if he ever get findrnDr. Evil's hideout.xa0 He got up and wentrndown stairs and saw that Mr. Husah and his men went into a door, probably hisrnoffice.xa0 Titti came back and joinedrnAustin to discuss their next move. \"Howrndid it go with Mr. Husah's Body guard?\" Austin wondered. \"Oh,rnput him out,\" Titti replied, and reality she did, in the trash container, \"Howrndid it go with Mr. Husah? What did you find out?\" \"Well,rnhe smelled bad, like rotten potato, almost like a circus freak.\" Austin repliedrnas he shivered from the thought,xa0xa0 \"Hernhad bad taste in clothes, and he is a liar.xa0rnWe have to tail him if we are ever going to find my brother.\" Laterrnthat evening Titti and Austin sat in their rental right across from thernclub.xa0 They've been there for an hourrnand Mr. Husah or his men never came out.xa0xa0rnAustin was munching on some McDonald's fries and Titti was sipping onrnher small diet Pepsi. \"Dornyou thing he'll come out anytime soon?\" Titti wondered. \"Irnhope so baby,\" Austin replied, \"I can't sit in this car alone with you, notrndoing anything.xa0 I mean, it's justrnboring.\"xa0 He then looked at her, \"Whyrndon't we take a little breather and use the back seat for once,\" \"Bastard!\"rnShe shouted. \"Well,rnI thought we made a connection last night, didn't we?\" Austin wondered. \"No,rnlook, \" She pointed towards the club and there he was mingling with the doorrnman, \"Fat Bastard.\" \"Excellent,rnlet's follow him,\" Austin Powers replied. But before Austinrnturned on the motor, something smashed through Titti's Side window.xa0 Titti screamed as a huge hand lured in afterrnher.xa0 Austin quickly looked and usingrnhis feet, tried to kick the intruder's hands, but he then heard a gun cock,rnfrom his window.xa0xa0 Austin immediatelyrnrecognized him as Mustafa. \"You!\"xa0 Austin said. \"You do recognizernme Mr. Powers,\" Mustafa said, \"That is good, now I am going to kill you now.\"rnMustafa raised his gun ready to fire. \"Hold on,\" Austinrninterrupted, \"I thought you died in The Spy Who Shagged Me ? How did yournsurvive?\" \"I'll never tellrnyou , \" Mustafa replied. \"Oh thatrnright.xa0 I need to ask you two morerntimes,\" Austin said, \"How did you survive?\" \"I spit on thatrnquestion,\" Mustafa replied spitting on the ground. \"Austin!\" Tittirncried as he turned to see that Piranha grabbed Titti and has her in a halfrnnelson. \"Get out, or I'llrnhave my associate have a midnight snack,\" Mustafa ordered and Austinrnobeyed.xa0 Mustafa Smiled and said, \"Nowrnyour weapons, throw them on the ground.\"xa0rnAustin placed his hand inside his velvet jacket, took out his gun andrnthrew it on the ground. \"Good.xa0 In tornthe van.\"xa0 They all went into an allyrnand Austin and Titti was thrown in the back as Piranha closed than lock it. Inside Austinrnlooked around, but it was too dark to see.xa0rnThey then felt the vibration of the motor and the shift of weight, asrnthey knew they were moving.xa0 But wherernwere they going?xa0 Something told Austinrnthat it wasn't good. \"I'm sorry I gotrnyou in to this Austin,\" said Titti. \"It's ok baby,\" Hernreplied, \"I got in worse spots than this.xa0rnWe'll get out of this, I mean I am the Man of Mystery.\" \"That you are,\"rnShe said. The van was inrnmotion for a couple of hours, until it finally stopped.xa0 They both wondered where they were.xa0 Perhaps they are going to dump them somernwhere in the desert, but that's been done before.xa0 Suddenly the doors were opened and a bright light seeped inrnfilling the van.xa0 Austin and Titti saw arnshadow of two men, one was Mustafa and the other was Mr. Husah. \"Welcome Mr.rnPowers, Ms. Huge,\" Mr. Husah said as he looked to Mustafa, \"Get them out.\" Mr. Husah got outrnof the way as Mustafa and Piranha grabbed them, dragged them out, then tiedrntheir hands.xa0 Austin looked, as his eyesrnwere adjusted to the sun, they saw that they were at quarry.xa0 He saw a huge pit not more than a few yardsrnaway from him, and a tall crane looming above them. \"What are yourngoing to do with us?\" Austin asked. \"Dr. Evil told mernto get you out of the way,\" Mr. Husah explained, \"And that is what I am goingrnto.\" As a hook camerndown to greet Austin and Titti, Piranha and Mustafa placed them on thernhook.xa0 They then levitated into thernair.xa0 The crane moved them over the pitrnto a long shaft way. \"My quarry isrnfascinating Mr. Powers,\" Mr. Husah said, \"22 tons of rock mineral gets dig outrna day.xa0 5 tons of is a rare type ofrnmetal that NASA uses for its space vehicles.xa0rnThat only leaves 20 miles of complex tunnels.xa0 That shaft below you is about 20 meters deep.xa0 One I drop you two down in it, your legsrnwill be broken and you'll never get out alive.\" \"Very clever Mr.rnHusah, \"Austin replied, \"I gotta know one thing.xa0 What is you're connection with Dr. Evil?\" As Mr. Husah wasrnwalking away he heard Austin question, stopped, turned his head and replied, \"Irnthough your were smart to figure it out Mr. Powers.xa0 But since you are going to die, I better tell you now.xa0 Not only I dig out rock and metals, but alsornI make weapons of mass destruction on the side, sort of my hobby.xa0 Dr. Evil told me build 4 nuclear poweredrnrockets for his space shield.xa0 Well Irnhave to leaving you.xa0 Good Bye.\" He turned leftrntowards his limo, leaving Austin and Titti hanging.xa0 Mustafa and Piranha stayed to watch them suffer as he did asrnAustin left him for dead in that canyon two movies ago.xa0 The captors struggled as Austin had an idea. \"What are yourndoing?\" Titti wondered. \"My cufflinks arernfilled with Acid,\" he explained, \"if I can reach them I'll use it to burnrnthrough the ropes.\" \"That's good, butrnwe'll fall in to that shaft,\" Titti said. \"Not unless yournuse those shaggadelic legs to swing us out of the way.\" \"Brillant,\" Tittirnsaid as Austin went to work. He got one of thernlinks and squeezed it.xa0 A very littlernportion of clear liquid squirted out and it started to burn through thernropes.xa0 At the same time Titti andrnAustin swung back and forth.xa0 Mustafarnlook at them and knew something was up. Suddenly the ropes broke and they bothrnfell down on the ground missing the shaft by inches.xa0 They both got up dusting their selves off. \"NO!\" Mustafarnscreamed as they both looked up at them, \"That is all wrong!xa0 You were supposed to fall in to that shaft.rnHere, I'll show you.\"xa0 He carefullyrnclimbed in to the pit, but he lost his footing and fell rolling down the cliffrnside.xa0 He let go of the gun and rolledrnin to the shaft falling down as he screamed until they heard a thump.xa0 Titti quickly grabbed Mustafa's and fired atrnPiranha.xa0 Piranha was pushed back fromrnthe bullets and disappeared. \"Ow,\" a voicerncried in the pit, it was Mustafa as Austin and Titti looked down, \"I think myrnlegs are broken.xa0 I will try tornmove.xa0 Ow, Yes they are broken.xa0 If someone can get some help, perhaps arnrope, because I am bleeding right now and there is a snake approaching me.xa0 I do not think he is poisonous but, Ow! Hernjust bit my arm and I am getting dizzy now I just blacked out.\" He didn't sayrnanything after that and Titti was already heading towards the stairs as well asrnAustin.xa0 Once they got back on top, bothrnPiranha and Mr. Husah was nowhere to be seen. \"Well, Now what?\"rnAustin wondered. \"We can't follow them now.\" Titti knelled downrnat the tire marks and replied,\" Don't be too sure Austin.xa0 I grew in the desert and was taught by myrnfather to track animals in the sand.xa0 Irnthink we can do the same.\"xa0 She lookedrnaround and saw a dune buggy by a shed. \"Come on.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 The two black Sand Vipers they found in a makeshift shed that was on the mining compound, left a streaming dust tail that was miles long as the couple sped into the hot desolate desert. They were following the tire tracks that were slowly dissolving in the Egyptian wind. Dune after dune it seemed that they were driving for hours, until the limo tracks completely disappeared. They slowed down and stopped. Titti got out first and examined the area. Austin looked on too. Nothing. Nothing but sand and desert. Titti never want to give up and neither did Austin. She then remembered something. As a child, her grandfather had told her tales of a lost king who never became king. \"Titti we don't have time for bed time stories baby,\" Austin said to her. \"You don't understand Austin,\" Titti explained, \"The people of Cairo did not like this king. He was so horrid that the people of Egypt killed him and dragged him to the desert. But before he died, the king told the Forman to build a pyramid. Unfortunately the Forman didn't like him either as he stiffed him for the bill. So the Forman decided, 'Ok I'll build your pyramid.' He did, but no one but he knew where it was. When the king died, he told a few of his friends were the pyramid was. So they dragged him to somewhere out here and placed him in his pyramid. The Arab helpers sore to an oath never to reveal the location of the king's tomb.\" She gazed about for a moment, \"That oath may have been broken sometime in the past.\" \"What does this have to do with my brother, baby?\" Austin inquired. \"Your brother may have found the infamous underground pyramid,\" she answered him, \"Problem is; we don't where to look.\" She then stopped and a wondrous smell was in the air. She sniffed the air to see what the smell was. For a moment it smelled like… \"You smell something?\" Austin smelled it to. \"Odd, I didn't know McDonald's had a restaurant chain out here,\" he said. \"They don't.\" She looked to the west, then north, and finally to the east were there were a huge sandy mound not more than twenty meters away. She then saw smoke slowly protruding from behind it. She cocked an eye brow and looked to Austin for an answer. Austin looked back with the same look. They decided to investigate. The fried food smell became stronger as they climbed over the dune. The white fluffy smoke emitted from a long cylinder smoke stack that was dug in the ground. Austin looked around, and suddenly he became blind. Not by the sun, but worse. \"Oh my god, my eyes, my eyes!\" Austin cried softly as he pulled Tiiti on the ground. \"What is it?\" Titti inquired as he looked. \"No don't look!\" he warned her, but it was too late. Titti looked, and below was the most disgusting fowl thing she ever saw. It looked like a beached walrus drenched in sweat. It was, Fat Bastard naked. He was lying on a huge towel bathing in the Egypt sun. She quickly adverted her eyes. \"Oh, my god!\" she said. Austin then said, \"I know I know. Well, let's look on the bright side. If Fat Bastard is here, my brother can't be far behind. We, we gotta wait to see if he goes inside, then we'll follow him.\" \"If he goes inside,\" said Titti. \"Of all the assignments I had,\" Austin, \"This got to be the toughest ever.\" \"Because Dr. Evil is your brother and you can come to stop him?\" Titti asked. \"No, watching Fat Bastard sun bathing,\" he replied sickly. It's been an hour since their arrival and Fat Bastard didn't move a muscle. Then suddenly he got up. Titti tapped Austin who was only resting his eyes. They got ready to follow him only to see that he was trying to turn over on his stomach. It was like watching raw dough roll on the table. They sighed in disappointment as they continue to wait. Two hours later, as Austin snored; Titti saw the large Scotsman move again. This time he was sitting up. It took Fat Bastard a full ten minutes to get on his feet. Titti nudged Austin. \"No mummy, you can't make me help wash grammy,\" Austin mumbled. Titti tried again and said, \"Austin!\" He instantly woke up, \"Yes yes, I'm here, and we're back.\" Titti pointed as Fat Bastard put on his Egyptian golden robe that was in a beach bag. Austin looked as he adjusted his binocular spectacles. He saw Fat Bastard take out a hand held device that looked like a TV remote control. He pointed it to the ground and pressed a button. Then suddenly the sand started to sink into the ground as an opening appeared. It was a huge electronic door that slid open. It was so big in fact a truck could fit through it. Below the sand was a large ramp that descended deep beneath the desert. The enormous Scottish man waddled down. This was their chance. \"Come on Austin,\" Titti said as they quietly made their way down the sandy dune. They then raced over to the descending ramp. The duo walked down cautiously as the opening began to close. They crept behind Fat Bastard. \"All right Tubby!\" Austin said as Fat Bastard turned to them. Austin and Titti had their guns raised at hit. \"Where's my brother?\" \"Well, ain't it mister super thin spy. Ya, got ya memory back didja?\" Said Fat Bastard, he then looked to Titti and cooed, \"Well, hello lassie. Why don't' ya take a break of spyin' and ride the tidal wave with me, eh?\" \"What a tic,\" said Austin, \"I thought you lost all that weight, how did you get it so fast?\" Fat Bastard told them, \"Well, there is an interstin' story behind that. Ya see, I tried to pick up women, but it seemed that they weren't interested in my vagina. I got depressed again, and well you know the rest.\" Titti and Austin nodded knowing how it was. \"Well, you are going to take us to Dr. Evil,\" Titti ordered him. \"I think not lassie,\" Fat Bastard said as a sly smiled grew on his face. Suddenly they were grabbed behind by two large hands. They turned to see a tall man with steel trap-like jaws grinning at them. They then passed out. \"Ach, I didn't know you knew the Vulcan neck pinch,\" said Fat Bastard as Piranha nodded.

Weird Girl has not been the same simce. She stopped going to school a few days at a time and stopped talking to any of her classmates. Despite ever really talking to her, Elsa and Victor worried about their strange friend. As for Bob, Toshaki, Edgar and Nassor, they didnt notice. They were still getting over dutch day themselves. That day after school, Elsa and Victor were walking home together. But on there way there they passed weird girls house, and noticed that she was sitting outside on her pourch all alone. She looked really sad, ans since she no longer held her little white kitty in her arms she looked broken as well. \"Hey Elsa, why dont you go talk to her?\" asked Victor. \"Huh? why me??\" Elsa said in a confused voice. \"Well.. uh id do it myself but I think what she really needs right now is another girl to talk to\". Elsa sighed knowing that he was right, \"Okay I will, see ya Victor\". With a wave goodbye, she walked up to weird girls house. \"Uh...hi\" said Elsa, weird girl looked up noticing the only girl from her class that payed her attention. \"Hi Elsa\" weird girl said in a low voice. \"I noticed that you hadn't been at school latley, I just wanted to see if you were ok\". Weird girl sighed, \"What's the point of going to school? I have no friends and no one even notices me\". Elsa shook her head \"Thats not true, me and Victor notice you. We miss having you at school, plus I think I know a way that could help others notice you more.\" \"Oh ya? How??\" weird girl asked. \"I'll help you, come on let's go to my house\" said Elsa as she grabbed her hand and made there way to her house.[Chapter 2] When they got to Elsa's house, Elsa's uncle was outside watering the plants. When he saw the two girls he did not look happy (like always). \"And..who is this?\" he asked, \"My friend from school, she's here to help me with my homework\" Elsa said. Weird girl looked at her suprised. \"Thats fine, she looks like someone who can actually help bring your grades up!\" he snappes before returning to hia flowers. Walking inside the two girls made there way up the stairs. \"Your uncle seems kinda crabby\" Elsa giggled, he's always like that, but don't worry he wont bite. Weird girl gave her a small smile and fallowed her friend into her bedroom. Inside there was a queen sized bed, with nightmare before xmas sheets.Purple walls with band and movie posters. And a big vanity with a mirror and lots of makeup and hair products. \"Go ahead sit down, we need to see what hair styles and make up looks good on you\". Weird girl was confused, \"Whats all that for??\" \"For your new look, im giving you a makeover\" said elsa. \"What makeover?! How do you even know ill look good when your done?? And what if no one notices me?! \"You just gotta trust me, youll get noticed I promise. Plus who else are yoi gonna trust to help you out??\" Weird girl nodded knowning she was right. For the next few hours or so, Elsa brushed, cut, dyed, applyed makeup and picked out the perfect outfit for her friend. When she was finally done she said \"Okay you can open your eyes now\". Weird girl did as she was told and couldnt believe how great she looked!! Her once long and wavey blonde hair, was now dyed a beautiful shade of bright red strawberry blonde with a few streaks of black highlights. The usual Pink floarl patterned dress she always wore, was now replaced by a maroon blouse with sleeves that showed her shoulders. Complete with a black minni skirt and black Kombat boots. But what she loved most was the way hwr makeup was done. She had on plenty of masscerra wich made her eyeslashes much longer, black eyeliner and faded pink eye shadow that made hwr eyes pop out. And on her lips was a clear lipgloss that smelled like cherries. \"Wow is that really me??\" she asked while looking into the mirror. Elsa nodded,see I told you that you could trust me, you'll definitely be noticed now\".[Chapter 3] \"Thank you Elsa, thanks to you I feel and look great. I think im ready to come back to school, ive missed seeing everyone\". \"Im happy to hear that, and just out of curiosity is there a certain someone you want in particular to notice you?\" Elsa askes with a wink. \"Well... ive had a crush on Nassor for the longest time\". Elsa smirked she figured it would be Nassor, he was after all the 2nd weirdest boy in class (the first was edgar). \"Well qith this new look, you'll be getting alot of guys looking at you and if your lucky Nassor will be one of them\". Weird girl smiled and out of nowhere gave Elsa a friendly hug. Elsa decided not to be akward and hugged her back. \"Bye Elsa\" said Weird girl as she left Elsas house. \"Bye hope you come to school tomorrow\", said Elsa with a wave. \"I really hope this works\" she thought to herself as she went back inside. *THE NEXT DAY* Elsa sat at her desk, watching everyone else as they walked into the classroom. Soon the late bell rang and kids stopped coming in, but Elsa still continues to look at the door. While Mr. Rykruzki took roll call, victor turned to elsa and asked \"Why do you keep looking at the door?\" But before Elsa could respond, Edgar interrupted by saying \"are you expecting someone?!\" he asked with raised eyebrows. \"Sort of\" said Elsa in a flat voice doing her best not to roll her eyes. But a small smile krept across her face, once she saw her friend walk through the classroom door. \"She's here\" said Elsa in a low voice, but everyone else must have heard her because everyone was now looking at the beautiful girl in the doorway. \"Young lady are you new to this class?\" asked Mr. Rykruzki. \"No sir, im the girl who sits in the very back.. im known as weird girl among my classmates\". When she sais that, the teacher finally realized who she was, along with everyone eles. \"Woah\" said Victor and Edgar. \"Oh Vow\" said Toshaki with wide eyes. \"So B-beautiful\" sais Bob with a dreamy look. As for Nassor he couldn't choke out a word,he just stared at her amazed, with his jaw practically dropped to the floor.[Chapter 4] \"Well we're all glad to have you back weird girl, now please take a seat\". She did as her teacher told her and gave a small wave to Elsa as she walked by. She didn't even pay attention to the looks that everyone elese was giving her. Her part was pounding so fast as she approached her desk, and Nassor hadn't taken his eyes off of her even for a minute. She gave a small wave and smiled at him as she sat down. She smiled even more when Nassor blushed and looked down while he waved back at her. Actually all the boys in class were waving and winking at her. Elsa was right about this whole makeover deal.She really was getting more people to notice her. During lunch time, weird girl sat at her usual table outside. Usually she would just sit all alone, but today Elsa and the boys sat with her. \"Did you get in trouble for missing so much school?\" asked Bob taking a bite of his messy sandwich. \"Not really, my parents were disappointed but the teachers understood and said I could makeup my work if i stay after school\". Everyone nodded, \" View have missed vout on avot if view need velp jest tell me\" said Tosahki. Weird girl blushed, shq never expected that the 2nd most smartest boy in class to help her. He always seemed so hard core but she figured that was for his ego. \"..So ill be the one to ask, whats with the new look? We haven't seen or heard from you in weeks, and now you come back looking totally different, why is that weird girl?\" asked Edgar as he stared at hee qith hia big creepy eyes and smile. Weird girl noticed that Victor and Bob were staring at her curious about the question, but Tosahki and Nassor were sending daggers of glares at Edgar. \"Well..I..I..\" said weird girl starting to stutter, bug was saved from the question when Elsa cut in. \"I helped her! Look you guys dutch day had an affect on all of us. Victor nearly lost sparky again. I nearly lost my life, Bob's sea monkeys caused caos, Toshakis turtle almost ate him, and Nassor you nearly suffercated and became a real mummy\". As she said that, all the boys looked down with sad faces knowing she was right. \"And as some of you may recall, weird girl lost her cat in the process, her cat was her only friend. And I can understand how she feels...alot of us can. If I ever lost Persephone, I wouldn't come to school either. But me and Victor were worried about her so I decided to give her a makeover to speed up the recovery process.\" Everyone looked at weird girl to see if this was true, she nodded. \"After I lost Mr. whiskers I wasn't sure how I was gonna face all of you. I know ive acted strange before and have made alot of you dislike me, but im willing to give this another shot and actually become friends with all of you...is that okay?\" Everyone exchanged glances with each other until Victor broke the silence. \"You know..I still considerd you a friend even before you changed your look.Even when your cat predicted that my dog would die.\" \"Yeah, even though we have our differences among eachother I see this group of friends staying together for a long time\" said Bob with a weak smile. Hearing that made weird girl smile as well. Along with Elsa, Victor, Edgar, a smirk from Toshaki and even though he tried to hide it a small smile from Nassor.[Chapter 5] Later on after school, Weird girl stayed behind to catch up on her makeup work. She was behind on alot of assignments, and her parents would kill her if her grades started to go down. She sighed as she worked on her 5th English paper, she missed coming to school but she certainly didnt miss the work. At 5:30 she was finally able to leave school. While she was walking out she noticed Nassor walking with a backpack filled with two baseball bats. Once he saw her he stopped walking and waved. \"Hey did you have to stay for baseball practice?\" she asked as she walked up to him. \"Yes, are you on your way home??\" he asked kinda looking down. \"Yeah I am..do you wanna walk together?\" she asked with a blush. \"umm.. sure lets go\". said Nassor as he rubbed the back of his neck in a nervous fashion. As they walked weird girl couldn't stop smiling, her crush was walking her home and was actually her beside her!! Sure Nassor was a little gloomy and seemed like a person who didn't want to be botherd. But weird girl could see that he was like anyone else. She was just drawn to him. \"You seem happy, whats on your mind?\" asked Nassor snapping her out of her thoughts. \"Im just actually happy to have a friend to walk home with\". Nassor raised his eyebrows at her in a curious way. \"So..umm..hows baseball practice going??\" she asked trying to keep the conversation going and not onlu talk about herself. \"Its going fine, Im happy that I havent gotten knocked unconchis in a while\". Weird girl looked up at him and they both laughed remembering the time Mr.Whiskers predicted that. Thinking about Mr.Whiskers made her a little sad, but actually seeinf Nassor smile and laugh and being happy made her happy as well. When they made there way to Weird girl's house neither one of them knew what to say. Both just stood there smiling and looking nervous. \"Well ..thank you for walking me home..see you tomorrow\" she said as she started walking away. Just as got to the the front door she heard Nassor say \"Goodbye..my beautiful weird girl\". She quickly turned around and watched him walk away. She couldn't believe that he had just called her beautiful!! She quickly ran inside and happily threw herself onto her bed. She was so happy that she srarted jumping on her bed. \"OMFG I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL ELSA!!!\"[Chapter 6] \"What? He really said that?\" Asked Elsa as she walked with Weird girl to school the next day. \"Yeah he did, I swear ever since I got this makeover its a whole new beginning for me\". Elsa smiled \"Well im glad, I was happy to help you with your new look\". The two girls continued to walk to school until Victor rode passed them on his bike. He stopped and smiled at Elsa, \"Hey need a ride to school?\" \"Umm I dont know..\" she said as she looked back at weird girl. \"Go ahead Elsa, I dont mind walking the rest of the way to school on my own. Its not that much farther anyways\". Elsa nodded and was very glad that she understood. She hugged her friend goodbye and got on the back of Victor's bike. Weird girl watched as the two of them rode away and walked the rest of the way by herself. When she got there she saw BoB and Toshaki walking with alot of other kids, she even saw Nassor. When she saw him she got nervous but when he looked at her and waved, she waved back and smiled. She stood there still waving and in a daze, that she didn't even notice that Nassor and plenty of others went on without her. \"Weird girl! ..Weird girl!... WEIRD GIRL!!! Quickly turning around she saw that it was Edgar calling out her name. \"Comeon were gonna be late for class!!\" With that said he grabbed her by the hand and ran into the building. However Weird girl was having a hard time keeping up. She was a good 3 feet taller than him and he wabbled alot when he ran. When the two of them walked into the classroom everyone was staring at them. It wasnt until weird girl looked down that she realized why. Edgar was still holding her hand! \" Um Edgar you can let go now\" she said yanking her hand away. Edgar just shrugged and walked to his seat. As she walked to hers she noticed that Nassor looked really upset. But she couldn't understand why, this wasnt his usual gloomy upset look, this was the look of completely pissed off. He was glaring at Edgar and noticed that Weird girl was staring at him but he wouldn't look at her. Throughout the day, weird girl sat on her desk trying to figure out why Nassor was being this way. Its not like there was (or ever would be) Anything between Edgar and her...wait a minute..thats it!! Nassor was jealous..wicj ment... he liked her too!!! Weird girl was so happy that she accidentally let out a squeal of happiness! So loud that it caused everyone to look at her, including Mr.Rykruzki. \"Is there something youd like to share with class young lady?\" \"No sir, I was umm just happy that I solved this science equation\". The class let out a small laughter as she slummped down in her seat laughing at herself. \"Umm is there something youd like to share with the class young lady?\" he asked. \"No sir, i u was just happy that i finally solved this science equation\" she sais holding up her work. The class let out a small fit of laughter, while she slummped down in her seat laughing at herself.[Chapter 7] Later on at lunch Elsa pulled Weird girl aside to have a girl to girl talk. \"So what was that all about this morning with Edgar? And the squealing in the class??\" she asked. weird girl blushed and explained the whole situation. \"So you really think he's jealous?\" asked Elsa. \"Well what other explanation is there?..Elsa I think he likes me back\". While the girls were having there conversation,Edgar has just arrived outside to have his lunch. While he walked around, Nassor cornerd him. \"Why were you holding weird girls hand today?!\" He asked in his serious voice. \"I..I just noitced that she was going to be late this morning, so I ran into school with her, and to help her run faster I grabbed her hand\" said Edgar in a defensive voice. Despite what he said Nassor still continued to glare at him. \"What are your feelings twards her?\" he asked. Edgar looked down nervously, I just like her as a friend, sure she's pretty but im not interested in her at all.\" Nassor sighed and put his hands on hips, \"This is the first and last time that im going to tell you this.Leave her alone, she isn't yours.\" Nassor backed off and started walking away, but as he did he heard Edgar say \"She's not yours either!!\" Nassor looked back at him, along with lota of others who we're nearby who heard Edgars outburst. Victor,Toshaki, and Bob ran over to the two boys who continued to glare at each other. \"Ey vat is going von here?\" said toshaki. \"Are you guys gonna fight?\" Bob asked in a excited voice. Nassor just ignored him and continued glareing until he finally said \"Just wait and see.\" As he walked away Victor asked, \"What was that about?\" \"Vah vat did you do to vihm?\" Asked Toshaki. Before Edgar could answer bob said \"So..im confused, theres not gonna be a fist fight?\". \"He just aksed why i came into class with weird girl. I dont understand why hed get so mad.\" At this point all the boys were confused as well. \"You think maybe he likes her?\" bob asked. \" We shouldn't jump to conclusions,plus if he dose it's none of our business\" Said victor. Soon the bell rang and everyone went back to class. Later on once school was out, Mr.Rykruzki made an announcement. \"Remember children, since we are getting so close to the end of the school year. There will be a dance this weekend to celebrate.\" Hearing that made everyone excited and everyone started talking all at once. \"Wanna go together Elsa?\" Victor asked with a small blush. Elsa smiled, \"Sure id love too.\" Weird girl, who happened to be watching them was very happy for her friend. \"Aww how cute\" she thought, thats when ahe got an idea! Maybe if she went to go visit mr.whiskers, she couls get a sychic reading to see if anyone would ask her to the dance.[Chapter 8] After the last bell rang, she ran passed everyone and out the door of the school. \"Voah, vhy is she in vuch a vurry?\" asked Toshaki, Bob and Edgar just shrugged but as for Nassor he decided to fallow her and miss out on baseball practice. He was perfectly out of breathe once he reached the gates of the pet semtery. But gatherd all of his energy once he saw werid girl walking twards the old burned down windmill. Where after a while she set up a tombstone for her poor little kitty.When he saw her sitting down and talking to the grave he slowly and quietly hid behind a nearby headstone listening to what she was saying. \"Hi Mr.Whiskers, I really miss you kitty. You probably wouldn't even recognize me..im back in school now and theres a dance coming up. I wish you were here to tell me who im supposed to be going with..\" As she said that she put both hands on each side of the tombstone and closed her eyes. Nassor watched her with raised eyebrows, did she really think that her dead cat would speak to her? Even if it did work he hoped that Mr.Whiskers would tell her that he would be the one to ask her to the dance. After a while it looked like weird girl was getting ready to go. To avoid getting caught Nassor quickly got up and ran to the tomb of his dead hampster. As he stood there mourning over his pet and rethinking about the events from dutch day.He senced a presence behind him, turning around he saw weird girl smiling and waveing at him. He gave a wave back and approached her.\"Did you come here to visit your pet too?\" He asked even though he already knew the answer. She nodded and gave a small frown,\"Im sorry about your hampster.\" Nassor shrugged \"He was a great pet, I feel somewhat responsible for his 2nd death. Weird girl put a hand on his shoulder, \"You didnt know he was going to die again. But did yoi really think he could kill Toshakis monster turtle?\" At this point her body was tense and she removed her hand, she half expcted him not to answer or be mad. But to her surprise Nassor let out a small laugh! \"Well I guess I did, but once I saw my poor calousus crushed by that turtle,I knew I was wrong. Not to mention i was nearly suffercated in a real life mummy tomb.\" \"Yeah...im the one who helped you out of it\" said weird girl in a shy voice. Nassor stared at her with wide eyes, \"..Really?! No one ever told me who did it. They just said I was lucky to still be alive.All I remember is waking up back in my own bed, but.. but... I had no idea it was you who saved me.\" said nassor as he grabbed both of her hands and and held them in his. Weird girl smiled at him, \"I..Ive liked you for a really long time Nassor, when i saw you trapped in there I was more than happy to save you\". Nassor didn't understand what was happening to him, he was feeling emotions that he had never experienced before..he liked her too!! So with all of his courage he let out a deep breath and asked, \"Weird girl..umm..would you like to..umm...go to the dance with me?\" \"Of course I will!!\" she said before she have him a small kiss on the cheek and ran down the hill twards the exit. \"Bye, see you at school!\" she said with a wave. Nassor stood there in schock, with his hand on his cheek that was now blushing a deep red. He was in so much shock that he didnt even notice that someone was watching the whole time nearby. It was Toshaki! He had also came to the cemetery to visit his dead turtle. As he watched what happened between Nassor and weird girl, he couldn't help but feel a wave of anger and jealousy take over him. Now that weird girl was conciderd the prettiest girl in class, Toshaki did in fact feel a small attraction twards her. So why should Nassor have her all to himself?! That's when Toshaki came up with a devious plan to mess with their relationship. He smiled evily and tapped his fingers together as he walked away.[Chapter 9] *MEANWHILE AT ELSA'S HOUSE* So he really asked you to the dance? Asked Elsa in her calm voice, but did her best to act surprised. \"Yeah! And of course I said yes.I was so happy that I kissed him! I KISSED HIM ELSA!!\" Elsas eyes widened, \"Really?! on the mouth?\" she asked. Weird girl looked down embarrassed. \"Um..no it was on the cheek, but it still it was amazing.\" Elsa smiled and wrapped an arm around her friend, \"I know how you feel. I felt the same way when Victor asked me. So what are you gonna wear?\" Weird girls face went blank, that hadn't even crossed her mind till now. \"I.. I have no idea.. Elsa can you help me again please?!\" she asked in a pleading voice. Elsa nodded, if she could make her friend look amazing with the makeover. She could definitely make her look amazing for the dance. *SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY* While everyone walked into school on time, Nassor was late. It was the day before the dance and Nassor had spent the whole night before searching for the perfect outfit and practicing how to dance. He wanted to make a impression on her and make her like him even more. But now he could bearly stay awake as he made his way to school. Back in the classroom while Bob and Edgar were talking about video games and Victor and Elsa were passing love notes. Weird girl sat at her desk worried about Nassor. She wondered why he wasn't there next to her in his desk talking to her. She sighed and rested her hand on her palm. \"Vello Veird Girl\" Said Toshaki as he approached her. She looked up at her forgine classmate, he looked smart like always and he was smiling at her! \"Hi Toshaki\" she said with a wave, but kept a straight face the whole time. \"You vook very pretty today\" he said with a raised eyebrows, weird girl gave him a confused look, why was he talking to her? \"Umm thank you..\" she said trying not to sound akward. \"So as vou kno the vance vis tommorow, vould vou vike to go vith me?\" he asked while giving her that same evil smirk. Weird girl was in shock, she certainly was not expecting this. \"Th-thats very sweet Toshaki, but I can't im going with Nassor.\" A chill ran down her spine as Toshaki gave her the same serious look he's given everyone else. But quickly changed it when he noticed her fear. \"Vell if you change vour mind, I'll still ve at vhe dance veautiful girl\" he said with a wink and walked away. When she was sure that Toshakis bacl was turned around, Elsa went to comfort her friend. \"What was that all about?\" she asked, weird girl shrugged. \"I guess he wanted to ask me out, thank god Nassor wasn't here. I know how jealous he can get.\" Just as she sais that, a zombie looking Nassor stepped into the classroom. He didn't bother to even talk to the teacher about his tardyness. He just walked passed everyone and threw himself at his desk. \"You should see whats wrong with him\" whisperd Elsa before she went back to her own desk. Weird girl got up, put a hand on hia shoulder and stroked his soft black hair. \"..Nassor are you okay?\" she whispered in his ear. Nassor just nodded and layes his face in his crossed arms and slept. Before she went back to her seat weird girl gave him a small kiss on his head. Of course everyone in the class was watching them, most of the girls in class said \"Awwww\" when they saw the kiss. And as for the guys they just stared at Nassor with a straight face, but by the look in there eyes they were thinking \"Damn Nassor your lucky to have her\". Once all the lessons and class work was done for the day were done, all the girls gatherd around Weird girls desk. They kept asking her questions. \"Did Nassor ask you to the dance?\" \"Have you kissed him yet?\" \"What are you wearing tonight?' \"We're you ever with Edgar?\" But the most common question asked was \"Are you with Nassor?\" Nassor who just happened to be awake at this point was listening to the conversation, and was honestly Wondering why none of the guys were bugging him with questions. But he was aslo curious to listen to what Weird girl had to say, especially her answer to the question if the two of them werw together. But before she could answer them, the bell rang and school was out. As everyone left, Nassor and weird girl we're the last ones to walk out and they were holding hands! \"Do you wanna walk home together?\" she asked. \"Sorry I have baseball practice today, but you'll definitely see me tomorrow night.\" Weird girl nodded and looked down with a small smile. She could bearly breath as Nassor lifted her chin and slowly leaned in for a kiss. And the kiss would have been perfect..except... SOMEONE HAD TO INTERRUPT!! Nassor felt a tap on his shoulder and quickly turned around. \"Vassor vits time vor practice\" said Toshaki walking passed them totally ruining the moment! \"Well I better go\" said Nassor, \"Oh okay\" weird girl was about to walk away, but was im complete shock when the softness of Nassors soft lips touched her cheek. She stood there blushing uncontrollably as Nassor walked away with a wink.[Chapter 10] When practice was finally over, Toshaki pulled Nassor to talk to him. \"So vis ting vou have vith Veird girl, vis it serious?\" Nassor was taken back at the question.He glared at his frienime, \"Why do you want to know?\" \"Vecause I vasked her to veh dance, but she said vat she was voing vith you\". Nassor nodded, \"Thats right and I would say that we are getting searious. I really like her\". Toshaki smirked, he knew exactly what to say to get under anyone's skin. \"Vunny vou should say vat,vou never vad any vintrest in her vefore\". Nassor was now losing his grip, \"Neither did you! Let me make this clear like I did with Edgar, stay away from my girl!\" once that was said Nassor stormed passed his frienime and made his way home. Toshaki just stood there and giggled to himself. He definitely had something eles in mind for weird girl and Nassor.. *THE NEXT DAY* Even though the dance was 8 hours away, Nassor wanted to make sure that he looked absolutely perfect. Instead of his usual Yellow long sleeved shirt and black jeans. He was dressed in a balck dress shirt with grey pants and black convers, And his hair was nicely slicked back. \"She wont be able to resist you\". Meanwhile back at Elsa's house, dresses we're scattered all over the floor,makeup was smeared and left open on her dresser, and a straightener and curling iron were over heating. \"Come out let me see you\" said Elsa to weird girl who had just finished getting dressed in her walk in closet. \"Okay..here i come..\" she said with a worried sigh as she came out. She looked absolutely amazing!!! She was wearing a black and white dress with cute designs and sequences of flowers, butterflies and heart's with black flats, and her hair was up in a high ponytail. Her makeup consisted of sliver sparkly eyeshadow, black eyeliner and Mascara and pink lip gloss. \"How do I look?\" she asked. Elsa smiled, \"You look awsome, a mix of your old self with your new self\". \"Thanks, your outfit is so much better though\". Elsa was wearing a silky white dress with black flower designes. Her hair was out of its pigtails and was now curled and pulled up into a fancy bun.She looked like an absolute goddess. \"Alright lets go meet our dates\" said weird girl in a excited voice as she walked out of the room. But before shw could go anywhere elsa grabbed her arm. \"Um before we leave we should probably clean up in here\". Both girls looked at the mess they caused and howled with laughter.[Chapter 11] AT THE DANCE* Nassor made his way through the gym door, since he was early he was the only one there without a date. So he decided to sit on the bleachers amd wait till everyone else got there. Soon enough a small crowd had gathered, Edgar, victor and Bob were apart of it. They saw Nassor sitting by himself and decided to talk to talk to him. \"Hey Nassor\" said the 3 boys at the same time. Nassor looked up at them and gave a small wave. \"Hi to all of you, where are your dates?\" \"Shes on the way with yours\" said Victor. \"I cam for the free food\" said Bob, \"I juat came cause its better than sitting at home missing my dead goldfish\" said Edgar. Both Victor and Nassor rolled there eyes at him, especially since Nassor never believed him abour the fish in the first place. \"Hey look guys theres Toshaki\" said Bob ponting. Nassor looked over at him and noticed that Toshaki was gestering him to come here. \"I wonder what he wants\" whispered Victor to Edgar. Without saying anything Nassor calmly walked over to Toshaki and fallowed him outside the gym. \"Where are we going?\" Asked Nassor, but instead of getting an answer back he felr the tightness of thick rope wrap around him. \"I got vou dumbvass, get vin there!\" Toshaki sais as he kicked Nassor into a nearby Janitor closet. \"Why are you doinf this?!\" Nassor screamed. \"Vecause I am Vetter at everything vou do, especially vhen vit comes to pretty girls. Vou lost vour pet,vow your about to lose vour girl. Voh and vy the way Nassor, youll ve fine. Your used to veing tied up\". With thag sais he slammed the door and walked away. Nassor screamed for help and kicked against the door, he had to find a way out. He didn't want to go through this whole mummy thing again!!! LATER* Weird girl and Elsa had finally finished cleaning up the mess and were now making there way to the dance.Once Victor saw Elsa he happily ran to her and hugged her tight. Weird girl said Hi to Edgar and Bob and asked \"Have you guys seen Nassor? He was supposed to meet me here\". \"Last time I saw him, he went to talk to Toshaki\" said Edgar. \"About what?\" she asked. Bob shrugged \"Not sure, I don't know about you guys but im starving!!\" He said before he ran/wobbled to the snack table. Soon enough everyone was dancing.As for Weird girl she juat sat there watching and waiting for Nassor to show up. A tap on her shoulder made her quickly turn around, she smiled hopeing it was Nassor, but her smile faded when she saw it was just Toshaki. \"Hi vhere, vou look beautiful vike alvays\". Weird girl nodded at his statement \"um Toshaki do you know where Nassor is?\" She asked hopeing hed give her some good news. \"Voh don't vorry about vim. Veh told me veh vasnt feeling so good so veh vent home\". Weird girl couldn't believe that Nassor would stand her up like this. \"Aww don't vook so sad,I can ve vour date\" he said as he ran his boney fingers through her ponytail.[Chapter 12] A part of her wantes to no!! and go see if Nassor was really home sick. But at this point she felt hurt and humiliated that she didnt care. So she put on her best fake smile and danced with Toshaki. But when Elsa and everyone else noticed, they started to become concerned. \"I thought she was supposed to come with Nassor\" said Edgar. \"Didn't you guys say that Toshaki was talking with Nassor before we came into the gym?\" Elsa asked. Victor nodded \"Something's not right, lets go check this out\". Edgar nodded and told Bob what was going on. \"Elsa you stay here and keep an eye on them, we'll be back\" said victor as he and the guys went outside the gym. \"How are we gonna find him?\" asked Bob, \"We'll split up , Edgar you check the inside of the school, I'll check the baseball feilds...\" but Victor was cut off by Bob saying \"Ooh ohh can i check the cafeteria??\" \"Yes fine let's go\". Everyone made there way to there destinations calling Nassors name constantly. About 20 minutes later Edgar was just about to give up and go meet with the guys, when he heard someone scream \"HELLO! PLEASE HELP ME! IM IN HERE!!\". Edgar noticed that the voice was coming from inside a nearby Janitor's closet. \"There you are, weve been looking for you!\" \"Yeah that's great and all, but could you please be so kind as to untie me!!\" Nassor snapped. Edgar did as he was told and soon enough, he and Nassor ran outside to meet up with the other boys. \"What the heck were you doing in a janitors closet?\" asked Bob. \"What the hell do you think?! Toshaki tied me up and locked me in there. It was Dutch day all over again i tell you!!\" \"Well you might wanna get in there man, he's dancing with your girl\" said Victor. Once Nassor heard that he pushed everyone out of the way and burst into the gym. Once he saw Toshaki with his arms around Weird girl, his blood started to boil! Nassor marched right up to them and pulled them apart! \"Get your hands off of my date!!\" Nassor growled as he picked up Toshaki by his collar galreing at him.[Chapter 13] \"Nassor?! What are you doing here?? Toshaki told me that you were at home because you were sick.\" said weird girl. \"He lied to you! This jerk tricked me, tied me up and locked me in a janitors closet!!\" As he said that Nassor watched as that evil smirk spread across Toshakis face. \"I told you, im vetter than vou, im the one vith the girl\". At this point Nassor couldn't take it anymore and punched Toshaki straight in the face! A silence fell over everybody as Toshaki fell to the floor. When he got back up, warm red oozing blood was streaming from his nose and mouth. Causing alot of people to gasp. \"Vat actually hurt a vittle bit\",he said said wiping away the blood. \"Its gonna hurt even more when I kick your ass!\" Once Nassor said that a group gathered around them saying \"Fight! Fight!\" Punches were thrown and blood stained the floor. Now, I know what your thinking, why aren't the adults or teacher's coming in to stop them? Well Mr. Rykruzki and the gym teacher were actually at the dance standing in a nearby corner watching the fight. \"Should we stop this?\" asked Mr. Rykruzki, the gym teacher shrugged \"We could but im curious to see who would win\". While everyone else just stood there watching, weird girl felt so overwhelmed by the situation that she felt she ahould be the one to stop this. She pushed her way through the crowd till she finally made it to the middle. \"Oh my god! What is she doing?!\" asked Elsa in a worried voice. \"Both of you stop it now!!\" said Weird girl as tried to pull Toshaki off of Nassor, but in the process Toshaki slapped her across the face causing her to collapse to the floor. Once they both relaized what had just happened, and hearing the gasps of everyone else caused both boys to stop dead in their tracks. Elsa and Edgar ran to weird girls side to help her up. At this point tears were forming in her eyes and he hand was holding her red swollen cheek. Finally she spoke up and said \"This is all your fault Toshaki! The only reason you wanted to take me away from Nassor is because of my new look! If I still looked the same you wouldn't even glance in my direction!\" Once she said that Weird girl got up and ran out of the gym. She heard Elsa, Nassor and many others call her name but she just kept running. When others were sure that she wasn't coming back everyone glared at Toshaki. \"You know she's right, if Elsa never helped her with her new look neither of you would be fighting over her!\" said Victor. Everyone else agreed and left the group that they had made. Soon they were the only two left standing in the middle of the floor while everyone else danced and ignored them. Nassor soon snapped out of his and ran after his girl! At first Nassor wasn't sure where she could be running off too. But that's when it hit him! There was only one friend in the entire world that she could turn too in her time of need. He quickly made his way to the pet cymtery, as soon as he went through the gates he called out to her. \"WEIRD GIRL?!, WEIRD GIRL WHERE ARE YOU?!\"[Chapter 14] When he didnt get an answer back he started to get worried. He ran and ran, so fast that he nearly tripped over every head stone that came in contact with him. His body ached from from tripping to much and from the previous fight from before. But Nassor chose to ignore the pain and put his full concentration on finding the girl that he feared he may lose soon. When Nassor climbed up the hill to find the grave of Mr. whiskers he threw himself down onto the soft grass below him and passed out from exhaustion. When he finally caught hia breathe, Nassor turned over and saw his girl laying on the ground of Mr. whiskers grave curled up into a ball. But what suprised him was that the fact that sparky (Victor's dog) was beside her licking her still swollen cheek. Nassor picked himself up with his arms and slowly crawled over twards her and gently started to shake her. \"Weird girl? Weird girl are you okay? please wake up.\" Slowly her eyes started to open, when she was fully awake, Nassor smiled and sparky barked with excitement. Weird girl sat up and even though her instincts told her to be mad, she knew deep down that it wasn't Nassors fault for what happened. So she decided to hug him instead, even though her touch hurt nassor sucked up the pain and hugged her back. \"Im sorry I fell for Toshakis trick, I shouldve known that youd never do something like that to me.\" Nassor nodded and gently removed the hair tie from weird girls ponytail, letting her hair fall free. \"Its okay gourges, you had no idea that he would do that to me. Im sorry that you got hurt in the process, is your cheek okay?\" Weird girl nodded and let him touch her cheek. \"The only reason why i got hit, was because I felt responsible for the stupid fight.\" Nassor looked down ashamed, \"I didn't mean to start a fight I really didn't, but he just made me so angry. Seeing you in his arms made me just wanna go over there and slap him silly\". Hearing that made weird girl giggel, she felt so great knowing that Nassor felt so deeply for her. \"Well the dance is still going on, do you want to go back?\" Nassor asked. At first weird girl wanted to say \"Sure let's go back with everyone else and have a good time\". But instead she said \"No lets stay here I like it when its just you and me. We can have our own little dance right here in the grave yard.\" Nassor looked at her confused,\"How are we gonna dance if we have no music?\" Weird girl took out her ipod from her purse amd shoved it at him. \"Wow beautiful and smart, what more could I ask for?\" said Nassor. As weird girl put her ipod on play she kneeled down and petted sparky. \"Go home sparky, thank you for caring about me\" sparky gave her one last lick and ran out of the graveyard. Once he was gone music started to play \"This is the story of a girl who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs I absolutely love her..when she smiles.\" As weird girl looked into Nassors eyes, she began to think about the night when she lost Mr. Whiskers. How he transformed from a cute fluffy little white cat, to the creepy vampire cat before he died. She still remembered that she still loved him even in his different stage. In the same way Nassor loved her even before she changed, even if he didn't know it himself. While the two of them continued to dance, Elsa, Victor and Edgar and Bob stood at the bottom of the hill watching them. Sparky had lead them here instead of going home. All of them were very happy for the two of them. This was a couple that was certainly worth waiting for. when the song ended, Nassor took Weird girl in his arms and kissed her passiontly, causing everyone to cheer for them! Weird girl couldn't be happier, Her new look may have come with alot of ups and downs but it was certainly a change for the better! THE END!!!

He was wondering about his own family. Who they were, how they were, where were they? He soon saw some familiar dogs rushing over to the house. This made him instantly cheer up, he then came to Jenny's side. \"Finished with your homework?\" \"I'll stop for now, why, do you wanna play?\" Jenny smiled as she decided to take a small break. She soon heard someone at the door and where it sounded like the dogs that come by for a visit once in a while. She put up her homework and came to the door with Oliver and opened it with a smile. \"Hey, guys.\" Dodger and the other dogs smiled back as they came into the house as they were regular visitors since Oliver lived there. \"Are you okay, honey?\" Rita asked Oliver. \"You seem a little sad.\" Einstein gasped. \"You didn't eat chocolate, did ya?\" \"No... It's just...\" Oliver sighed. \"I've been wondering about where I came from... All I remember is being in a box with other kittens, but... I wonder who my parents are.\" \"Well, I heard from someone that was there on the night you and your siblings were born knows where your father is.\" Tito said. \"Huh?!\" Oliver's eyes widened, he then rushed to the chihuahua. \"Tell me everything!\" \"Well, a rottweiler that owed me one time when I saved his tail from the dog-catcher told me that he saw a orange male cat leave his wife and kittens to start a new life in Paris,\" Tito told him. \"And where the mother cat was black and white.\" \"Really!\" Oliver replied. \"What was his name?\" Tito thought about it for a minute. \"Thomas O'Malley, he called himself.\" \"Then we have to go to Paris.\" Oliver said. Jenny put her papers together and then looked up as her parents came in. \"Oh, hi, Mom and Dad.\" \"Jennifer, we know you're off of school for the week, but would you like to come to Paris with us?\" Mr. Foxworth asked. \"We thought it would be a good trip for us all and you can invite your friends too if you would like.\" \"That would be perfect!\" Jenny beamed. \"Wow, what a stroke of luck.\" Oliver smiled. Jenny then hugged her parents as they were now set with going to Paris officially this time. She of course invited Akito, Estelle, Vincent, and Felicity to come along. In New York City on Fifth Avenue... It was a lazy day at the Plaza Hotel around teatime, Nanny was reading the newspaper with a cup of tea by the fireplace while Eloise had answered the phone and the lobby had called her down saying that there was a telegram for them which made her run down to the first floor of the hotel to see what it was all about. Ditto was of course on top of Eloise acting as her bow. Miss Thompson smiled as she was sure that Eloise would enjoy this surprise. \"Good morning, Miss Thompson.\" Eloise spun around happily. \"Good morning, Eloise, you have a telegram.\" Miss Thompson smiled back as she handed the paper from Western Union. \"Thank you, Miss Thompson.\" Eloise smiled. \"Of course.\" Miss Thompson smiled back. Eloise took the telegram and went to the elevator next to the usual silent attendant except for that one Christmas. \"Sixteen, please.\" she then requested. She was soon brought back to the sixteenth floor. Nanny was still reading her book until she then flinched as Eloise called for her. \" NAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNYYYYY! \" \"Eloise, must you do that?!\" Mrs. Thornton complained. \"Nanny, look what I have!\" Eloise smiled. \"Oh, how marvelous, marvelous, marvelous.\" Nanny smiled back. Eloise held out the letter to Nanny and put her glasses on. \"Nanny is far-sighted.\" she then told Ditto. Nanny adjusted her glasses and looked at the telegram. \"Why, it's from your mother, and she wants us to come visit Paris.\" Eloise grinned at that. \"We'll have to get our passport photos and call Dr. Hadley for your shots.\" Nanny then smiled back, but the last part made Eloise frown sourly. \"Must we?\" Eloise frowned. \"Oh, Eloise, your shots are good for you,\" Nanny replied. \"Plus you get a lollipop after.\" Eloise pouted and folded her arms about her doctor. \"I'll hold your hand so then the pain goes away faster.\" Nanny said. Eloise sighed in defeat. \"Okay, Nanny.\" Nanny nodded and then called Dr. Hadley to tell him that she and Eloise would be in Paris. \"I'll be with you.\" Ditto said to Eloise. \"I guess...\" Eloise pouted. Nanny then called everybody to tell them that she and Eloise would be away in Paris for a little while. Weenie comforted Eloise which made her smile and hug him. Meanwhile with the Fudos... The telephone rang. Mo then answered it, she then put it down after a moment and called out to Estelle since Jenny was her pen pal and all. Estelle took the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Bonjour, Estelle.\" Jenny smiled. \"Hello to you too, Jenny.\" Estelle smiled. \"Would you guys like to come to Paris?\" Jenny invited. \"My parents are going for the week and they said you guys could come along too if you wanted.\" \"Oh, Paris!\" Estelle smiled at the invitation. \"Would you like to come with?\" Jenny asked. \"I'd love to and I know someone else who'll happily come along if you're going.\" Estelle smirked slightly. \"Well, you tell him I'll meet him there.\" Jenny chuckled as she knew very well who she had in mind. It was all set then and everyone was getting ready to go to Paris. Oliver was mostly enthusiastic about going since he was finally going to find out about his family. \"And I think this trip will be good for Oliver too.\" Jenny whispered to her. \"I hope so, any reason why?\" Estelle replied. \"Well...\" Jenny looked around to make sure no one else was listening. \"Tito find out some information about him. Like... About his natural family.\" \"Oh?\" Estelle asked, then surprised. \"Yeah, we hope that this will help him.\" Jenny said. \"I hope so too, this sounds very important.\" Estelle replied. \"Fingers crossed.\" Jenny nodded before crossing her fingers. \"Fingers crossed.\" Estelle said before crossing her own fingers. Later on, it was time for Paris and everyone was getting there in their own way. Oliver was dreaming about his family and wondering what they would be like. If they would even remember him or even like him. \"Oliver?\" Jenny asked. Oliver looked over. \"You okay?\" Jenny asked him. Oliver sighed. \"What if they don't like me?\" \"How could they not?\" Jenny asked. Oliver shrugged. \"I was abandoned.\" \"Oh, Oliver, I'm sure there's a good explanation for all of that...\" Jenny hugged her kitten. \"Now please, stop worrying, it'll spoil your good time in Paris.\" \"Good point.\" Oliver said. \"It'll be okay, I promise.\" Jenny smiled. Oliver smiled back. Before everyone knew it, they were getting into Paris. Forte wasn't sure if he liked modern France all that much, but Cherry seemed to approve and so did Felicity, so he decided to give modern Paris a chance.[Chapter 2] \"It's so nice to see you two again.\" Vincent bowed to Mr. and Mrs. Foxworth. \"It's so nice to see you again as well, Vincent.\" Mrs. Foxworth smiled. \"Charmed.\" Mr. Foxworth agreed. Vincent smiled back to the parents of the girl he had strong feelings for. \"Jennifer also insisted that Oliver come along, did you bring you kitten?\" Mrs. Foxworth then asked. \"Of course, she only wanted to come since he was coming.\" Vincent nodded. Snow White soon smiled with a mew. Oliver smiled back to her. \"I've read in this guide that there is a wealthy, elderly woman named Madame Adelaide Bonfamile who lives here with her cats,\" Akito came to the Foxworth couple. \"Do you two know her?\" \"Oh, yes, we do; she's an old friend of ours.\" Mr. Foxworth said. Snow White soon noticed a white cat with the Pound Furries tag on her collar. \"Who's that?\" Oliver wondered. \"I dunno, but I'm going to find out.\" Snow White replied as she was going toward the other white cat. \"Now which way is it?\" The older white cat looked around. \"Excuse me?\" Snow White came in front of the older white cat. \"Ah, bonsoir, young félin.\" the older white cat greeted. \"Hello...\" Snow White smiled. \"Are you a Pound Furry?\" \"Yes, young kitten.\" The older white cat said. \"I thought so,\" Snow White nodded. \"Um, where are you headed?\" \"To my sister's house if I can find it.\" The older white cat said. \"Who's your sister?\" Snow White asked. \"Her name's Duchess.\" the older white cat replied. \"And what's your name?\" Snow White then asked, she felt connection with this cat somehow. \"My name is Maisy.\" the older white cat said. \"Maisy?\" Snow White then asked before smiling. \"Cool name.\" There were horse clops heard on the road which made everyone look as they then saw an elderly woman with her cats as they were taking a stroll around Paris together. Maisy soon recognized one of the cats. \"I think I've found my sister.\" she then smiled. Snow White smiled back about that. \"Oh, Marie, my little one,\" the old woman smiled to the white kitten in her hands. \"You're going to be as beautiful as your mother, isn't she, Duchess?\" Duchess mewed in agreement. They soon heard a cat meow which wasn't from Duchess, they soon looked for the source before they saw Maisy. \"Maisy...\" Duchess whispered as she locked eyes with the older white cat. \"Duchess.\" Maisy smiled. The driver had luckily stopped the carriage for a moment. \"Well, this looks like a family reunion.\" the old woman seemed to smile at the cats as they seemed to be all happy together. The black kitten hopped off of the driver's head and looked with the white kitten and orange kitten as they then smiled to Maisy since their mother was smiling. \"Duchess, I'm so glad to see you.\" Maisy smiled. \"It's been too long...\" Duchess smiled back in agreement. \"Oh, that's a nice collar, it looks 'purr-fect' on you.\" \"Thank you,\" Maisy smiled as she saw the kittens smiling up to her. \"I see you've been busy.\" Duchess chuckled. \"Oh, yes, indeed.\" \"They're so adorable.\" Maisy smiled. \"These are my children,\" Duchess introduced. \"Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse.\" \"It's wonderful to meet you, children.\" Maisy smiled down to the kittens. \"It's nice to meet you too, Aunt Maisy.\" the kittens replied with smiles back. \"I bet Marie will be as talented and as beautiful as her mother.\" Maisy smiled down to the white kitten. Marie smiled back. \"Thanks, Aunt Maisy.\" Maisy then nuzzled up against the old woman to show she was friendly and she wanted to ride with them. \"Oh, do you want to ride with us?\" The old woman cooed to Maisy. Maisy smiled. \"Come here, sweetie...\" the old woman helped Maisy into the carriage. \"There's room for everyone.\" Maisy smiled back and nuzzled against the old woman. \"Oh, she looks like she could be your sister, Duchess.\" the old woman smiled to her cat. Duchess smiled up to her and came up next to Maisy to confirm her owner. Maisy and Duchess smiled to each other which made the old woman smile to them. The kittens soon joined back with their mother. The driver seemed to roll his eyes about the many cats, but he then made the horse move again so they could get home. Toulouse was then climbing onto the man's head. \"What is Toulouse doing?\" Maisy giggled quietly. \"Oh, being himself.\" Duchess also giggled. \"Careful, Toulouse!\" the old woman chuckled herself. \"You're making it very difficult for Edgar.\" \"Oh, now where did that sneaky cat sneak off to?\" Darla asked as she looked around. \"I hope Weenie and your cat get along.\" Eloise said as she walked with Darla and Nanny. \"Oh, I'm sure they will Maisy gets along with any dog; just ask Patch.\" Darla said as she continued to look for the white cat. Eloise walked Weenie as they walked together on the streets of Paris. \"It's not like Maisy to wander off,\" Darla told her daughter and nanny. \"Except for maybe when Jessica's school took her for a little bit when she had her kittens as part of the animal science department.\" \"Hey, Aunt Darla.\" Estelle smiled as she and the others came over. \"Oh, hello, dear!\" Darla smiled back. \"So, where's your cat I've heard so much about?\" Snow White asked Darla. \"I'm trying to find her, but we're having difficulties.\" Darla replied. \"Yes, it's 'rawther' troublesome.\" Nanny agreed as she stayed close with Eloise and Weenie. \"By any chance, is she a white cat?\" Oliver asked. \"Why yes, yes, she is.\" Darla nodded. \"She went over there.\" Snow White said, pointing over to the old woman. \"Why thank you.\" Darla replied. \"Uh-huh.\" Snow White nodded back. Darla, Eloise, and Nanny soon hurried to Maisy. Maisy smiled, then looked over to the incoming family. The old woman looked by as she caught a quick glimpse of Nanny. \"I could've sworn that was Hilary Andrews...\" They soon arrived at a big house. \"Ah, home sweet home.\" Duchess mewed to Maisy. Maisy smiled back to her sister. \"Whoa, Frou-Frou, steady, girl.\" Edgar told the horse. \"Excuse me, ma'am!\" Eloise called out. The old woman looked over with a smile as the carriage came to a stop. \"Well hello there, who are you?\" \"I am me, Eloise,\" Eloise gave her usual introduction. \"I am six.\" \"I am Madame Bonfamile,\" the old woman smiled back. \"I am in my eighties.\" \"I can tell.\" Eloise said as her mother, nanny, dog, and cousins and uncles and aunts and their pets came over. The old woman was helped out of the carriage and she then looked to Nanny. \"Hilary Andrews, is that you?\" \"Oh, yes, it is,\" Nanny smiled. \"It's been a very long, long, long time.\" \"How's Gavin?\" Madame Bonfamile smiled back. \"He's marvelous, I got to spend Spring with him in Cape Cod.\" Nanny replied. \"It's very nice to meet you.\" Darla smiled. \"Likewise, oh, I see where you get your beauty.\" Madame Bonfamile said to Eloise. Eloise giggled in response as she hugged Weenie in her arms. \"Of course, Frou-Frou, I almost forgot.\" Madame Bonfamile then said to her horse and took out a carrot. \"It reminds me of Maggie back at the Plaza, she takes me all over New York if I want.\" Eloise told the old woman. Eloise's bow nodded a bit, surprising the old woman. \"Did your bow just nod at me?\" Madame Bonfamile asked. \"Ditto!\" Eloise giggled. Eloise's bow soon changed into Ditto. \"Oh, my word!\" Madame Bonfamile replied. \"I don't think I've seen such a thing.\" \"This is Ditto,\" Eloise smiled up. \"He's a Pokemon.\" \"A Pokemon? But I thought those weren't real.\" Madame Bonfamile said. \"You've heard of them?\" Eloise replied. \"Oh, yes, thousands of times, but I've never actually seen one.\" Madame Bonfamile replied. \"I'd love to say more, but I'm going to meet my lawyer, you're all welcome to come inside, I have plenty of room.\" \"Oh, yes, please.\" Mo smiled. \"Come along then.\" Madame Bonfamile invited.[Chapter 3] \"How do you know Nanny, ma'am?\" Eloise asked. Madame Bonfamile smiled down to her. \"I used to teach Nanny privately how to sing when she was younger.\" \"Nanny can sing?\" the others asked in slight surprise. \"Why of course, course, course.\" Nanny smiled. \"Fascinating.\" Felicity had never heard of the woman singing before. \"Berlioz, come back here,\" Duchess called to her black-furred son and prompted him to use his manners to the horse who had given them a ride home. \"Haven't you forgotten something, darling?\" \"Thank you, Miss Frou-Frou for letting me ride on your back.\" Berlioz said politely. \"You are quite welcome, young man.\" Frou-Frou chuckled to the black kitten. \"How was that, Mama?\" Berlioz smiled. \"Very good, darling, that was very nice.\" Duchess smiled back. \"You sure have taught your kittens how to behave.\" Maisy smiled. \"Oh, yes, believe me, it wasn't easy.\" Duchess replied. \"Is their father home?\" Maisy then asked, not knowing her sister was a single mother now. Duchess frowned bitterly while the kittens played around Frou-Frou's feet, not paying attention to their mother and aunt right now. \"What's wrong?\" Maisy asked, frowning with Duchess as she seemed to have brought back a painful memory. \"I'm afraid their father is no longer with us.\" Duchess frowned quietly. \"Oh... I-I'm so sorry...\" Maisy replied. \"It's all right, darling, you didn't know.\" Duchess said softly. \"What happened?\" Maisy asked curiously. \"If you don't mind me knowing.\" \"He was run over.\" Duchess frowned. \"Oh, my goodness!\" Maisy gasped. \"The children barely remember, but I know that they need a father, especially Berlioz and Toulouse.\" Duchess nodded. \"Well, who knows? Maybe you'll meet a new male cat.\" Maisy smiled. \"I'm not sure...\" Duchess replied. \"There was really no one else like Francois.\" \"You never know.\" Maisy shrugged. Duchess shrugged herself. \"Come along, Duchess, kittens, come along,\" Madame Bonfamile called as she let her guests inside of the house. \"Oh, and Edgar, I'm expecting my attorney, Georges Hautecourt. You remember him, of course.\" \"Of course, Madame,\" Edgar replied before mumbling to himself. \"How could anyone forget him?\" \"Oh, this place is a lot bigger and exotic than the hotel where Madame and Monsieur Dupois stay in.\" Eloise beamed as she looked all around the mansion owned by the retired opera singer. \"You can say that again.\" Estelle said. \"At least this place has an elevator unlike their hotel...\" Nanny agreed with Darla's friends from this country who welcomed them into Paris often. Darla giggled in response to her old nanny who took care of Eloise now. Oliver and Snow White walked together and came in front of the kitten siblings. \"Are you guys boyfriend and girlfriend?\" Marie asked as she stood between her brothers. \"We sure are.\" Snow White smiled. \"Long time now.\" Oliver smiled back in agreement. \"Ooh~\" Berlioz and Toulouse smirked. \"I think it's romantic.\" Marie smiled. \"You would...\" Toulouse scoffed at his sister. \"Wanna play with us?\" Berlioz asked the other kittens. Snow White and Oliver smiled at the invitation and decided to go play with the other kittens. 'I guess needing to know where my father is can wait.' Oliver thought to himself with a smile. Madame Bonfamile came into the room with the others with Duchess at the mirror with her. \"You look perfectly lovely, Madame Bonfamile.\" Eloise smiled as she lay down on the woman's bed with Skipperdee and Weenie beside her. \"You truly do.\" Darla said. \"Oh, you're both very kind, and it's nice to see you both in Paris for a change.\" Madame Bonfamile smiled. \"We've been meaning to be together in Paris.\" Eloise said. \"Yes, I need to be with my baby after all.\" Darla smiled as she then hugged Eloise. Scruffy was looking around the room, curious about it. \"There now, Duchess, that's better,\" Madame Bonfamile smiled to her cat. \"We must both look our best for Georges. He's our oldest and dearest friend, you know.\" \"Oldest and dearest friend?\" Mo smiled. \"How old is he?\" \"Oh, he'll probably outlive us all,\" Madame Bonfamile chuckled. \"He's my attorney.\" \"May I suggest my lawyer in Virginia, Mr. Nye?\" Darla offered. \"Who?\" Vincent asked. \"Mr. Nye is my mother's lawyer,\" Eloise explained. \"He has an office on Madison Avenue. He has already had the whooping cough and the measles,\" she then whispered the other part only for her cousins to hear. \"Sometimes I give him rubber candy, he is absolutely so dumb he eats it. Sometimes he brings he a present whether I deserve it or not, I usually do,\" she then spoke up louder again. \"Here's what he likes: Martinis. Here's what I like: Dandelions.\" \"Nice.\" Akito said. \"I don't like Mr. Nye that much myself.\" Darla whispered to Eloise, having heard what she said of what she did with the lawyer whenever he would visit the hotel. \"You have a lovely home, ma'am.\" Jenny smiled with a curtsy. \"Oh, thank you, dear,\" Madame Bonfamile smiled back. \"Natalie, she's so much like you.\" \"Don't I know it?\" Mrs. Foxworth beamed as she came in the room. \"That Vincent boy reminds me so much of Gregory when we were younger.\" \"He truly does.\" Mr. Foxworth said, agreeing with his wife. The Foxworth couple then smiled to each other as they held each other when Vincent and Jenny interacted. \"I look forward to hear stories of you all after I speak with my attorney.\" Madame Bonfamile smiled with them. \"And we'd be happy to tell you.\" Vincent said. \"Of course.\" Madame Bonfamile agreed. The kids smiled as they really liked this woman so far, especially Jenny since she was an old friend of the family's. Akito soon heard an old man coming. \"I hear someone coming, he kind of sounds old.\" he then told the others. \"That must be the attorney.\" Eloise hunched. \"He's singing some kind of song.\" Akito said. \"Yep, that's my attorney alright.\" Madame Bonfamile nodded. \"Would you dears mind?\" Darla replied. \"This is kind of grown-up business.\" \"Ah, yes, yes, yes.\" Nanny agreed. The kids then left the room to do something else while Madame Bonfamile would meet with her attorney. \"What should we do?\" Estelle asked. \"The kitties are outside.\" Jenny noticed. The kids then decided to go see their kittens as Edgar was going into one room. Akito had a slight suspicion about Edgar. \"You coming, Kito?\" Felicity asked. \"You guys go ahead, I'll catch up.\" Akito replied. \"Okay.\" Estelle said. Akito went back inside while the others went outside to play with the kittens. Akito decided to use his powers to find out what Edgar was doing. He cleaned the inside of his ear and used his super-hearing of course. He could hear Madame Bonfamile speaking with his aunt and the old English woman who was Eloise's nanny as Edgar was ironing his pants as he was listening in himself on the discussion of the old woman's will. \"Sounds like they are talking about her will.\" Akito whispered. 'And naturally, I want my beloved cats to be always cared for,' Madame Bonfamile's voice said. 'And certainly no one can do this better than my faithful servant, Edgar.' 'Edgar?' Georges replied in surprise as the butler did a victory dance in his room as he thought he would inherit everything from the old woman. 'Adelaide, you mean to say you're leaving your vast fortune to Edgar? Everything you posess? Stock and bonds? Thi-This mansion? Your country chateau? Art treasures, jewels and-\" 'No, no, no, Georges,' Madame Bonfamile replied as Edgar blew thankful kisses, but soon became very disappointed as the woman corrected her attorney. 'To my cats.' 'Well, that puts a damper in Edgars happiness.' Akito thought to himself. 'To your cats?' Georges, Darla, and Nanny asked in surprise, but not as bad as the butler's surprise. \"Cats?!\" Edgar gasped in dismay. 'Yes, Georges,' Madame Bonfamile replied before explaining. 'I simply wish to have the cats inherit first. Then, at the end of their life span, my entire estate will revert to Edgar.' 'But Madame, don't cats have nine lives?' Atticus asked. 'Oh, Atticus...' Cherry replied in slight deadpan. 'Well, you know, Duchess is grown up and she has her babies of course.' Madame Bonfamile replied. 'True. ' Atticus nodded. Edgar ranted about this, but made sure no one could overhear him, except for Akito of course. \"Cats inherit first! And I come after the cats. I, me, after-No. It's not fair! Ooh! I mean, each cat will live about twelve years. I can't wait. And each cat has nine lives, that's four times twelve multiplied by nine times,\" he then tried to do math before looking insulted even more. \"No it's less than that. Anyway, it's much longer that I'd ever live. I'll be gone. No. Oh, no. They'll be gone. I'll think of a way. Why, there are a million of reasons why I should! All of them dollars. Millions. Those cats have got to go.\" he then accidentally tore his pants. \"Ya gotta love it when bad guys talk to themselves.\" Akito said quietly to himself as he overheard all of that. He soon went to the others.[Chapter 4] \"You guys sure have some fun games.\" Toulouse said to the other kittens. \"Yeah, I wanna be an adventurer too!\" Berlioz beamed. \"The adventures we've had aren't games.\" Oliver said. \"Oh?\" the kittens replied. \"Trust us, we know.\" Snow White nodded. \"You would be surprised what we've all been through.\" Weenie even agreed. The Pokemon soon came out of their Pokeballs. Marie yelped and hid behind her brothers, a little scared of the Pokemon. \"It's okay, girl, they won't hurt you.\" Jenny soothed the kitten. \"They won't...?\" Marie asked as she slowly came out with Toulouse and Berlioz. Vulpix nuzzled against Jenny with a fond smile, feeling glad to see her yet again. \"I guess some of them are cute.\" Marie smiled. Teddy smiled back. \"Especially this one.\" Marie nuzzled her nose against the young Teddiursa. Teddy smiled bashfully and even seemed to blush slightly. \"Aw! Someone's blushing.\" Estelle smiled. \"So, what do you guys do for fun?\" Mismagius asked the kittens. \"We usually hang out around here, the real fun's in the activity room where the piano and paints are.\" Marie replied. Vincent's eyes lit up. \"Did you say paints?\" \"Papa really loves to paint.\" Vulpix said. Vincent smiled sheepishly. \"I do.\" he then admitted. \"Then we better get to the paint.\" Toulouse said. \"All right.\" Oliver agreed, he still wondered about meeting his father, but he was having so much fun with the other kittens that he didn't think about it as much. They all ran to the door together. \"Wait for me, wait for me!\" Berlioz called out. \"Ladies first!\" Snow White smiled as she ran up ahead. \"That's right!\" Marie agreed. Unfortunately, Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz got stuck together in the door. \"Why should you and Snow White be first?\" Toulouse scoffed. \"Because we're ladies, that's why.\" Marie replied snobbishly. \"Boys, they're right; they are ladies and they get to go first.\" Oliver said. \"Huh, Marie's not a lady.\" Toulouse scoffed as Marie jumped down, but Berlioz grabbed her by her tail. \"She's nothing but a sister!\" Berlioz added in. \"Let her tail go.\" Akito said as he saw what one of them was doing with his telescopic/X-Ray vision. Berlioz blinked and then let go of Marie which made her flop and slide against the floor. \"Okay, now to get you two out of the way.\" Scruffy said. Berlioz and Toulouse wiggled and popped out of the door. Snow White smirked to them and then came in through the cat door beside Marie. Dot soon came in next. \"Okay, guys, let's go.\" Oliver then said to Scruffy, Berlioz, Toulouse, and Weenie. Weenie nodded in agreement. The boys then came in together, one-by-one. Duchess was on her way down with Maisy as they then saw the pets fighting each other with tickling, clawing, and biting. \"Kids.\" Maisy sighed. \"Let me handle this,\" Duchess replied since she was the mother after all. \"Marie, darling. Marie, you must stop that. This is really not ladylike. The same with you, Snow White and Dot.\" \"Sorry, ma'am.\" Dot and Snow White frowned. \"And Berlioz, well, such behavior is most unbecoming to a lovely gentleman.\" Duchess then told her black-furred son. \"Well, they started it.\" Berlioz defended. \"Ladies do not start fights, but they can finish them.\" Marie retorted. \"Yeah.\" Snow White added. The two then smirked and high-pawed each other. Berlioz then stuck his tongue out at the girls. \"Oh, Berlioz.\" Maisy sighed to that. \"Berlioz, now, don't be rude.\" Duchess scolded. \"We were just practicing biting and clawing.\" Oliver said nervously. \"Aristocrats do not practice biting and clawing and things like that,\" Duchess replied as she was fixing Marie's bow tie. \"It's just horrible!\" \"But what if you are ever kidnapped?\" Snow White asked. \"Yeah,\" Toulouse smirked in agreement. \"Someday, we might meet a tough alley cat.\" he then jumped on the floor and hissed like a wild cat. \"Looks like a certain kitten is looking tough.\" Maisy giggled. \"Now that will do,\" Duchess laughed herself. \"It's time we concerned ourselves with self-improvement. Now, you want to grow up to be lovely, charming ladies and gentlemen. Now Toulouse, you go and start on with your painting and Vincent can help you since he seems interested.\" \"Oh, most certainly, ma'am!\" Vincent beamed to the mother cat. \"Yes, Mama.\" Toulouse said. \"Oh, yeah.\" Vincent beamed. \"Your brother really likes to paint.\" Felicity said to Akito and Estelle. \"After that adventure he had, of course he does.\" Estelle smiled. Vincent stood next to the orange-furred kitten with a blue bow tie. And where they both went over to two blank canvases. Toulouse was going to paint with his paws while Vincent was going to use the paintbrush that Barbie gave him. Vincent decided to just use one color of paint since his paintbrush was magical. \"Wow... How'd you do that?\" Toulouse asked. \"Magic.\" Vincent smiled as he painted a portrait of the cat family together. Toulouse smiled as he painted beside Vincent. \"Mama, Aunt Maisy, may we watch Toulouse and Vincent paint before we start our music lesson?\" Marie asked. \"Please?\" \"It would be nice to see how they are doing.\" Maisy said. \"Well, yes my love, but you must be very quiet.\" Duchess approved, agreeing with her sister. The pets agreed to staying quiet. Toulouse was mixing the oils, dripping some on the floor so that Berlioz had to jump aside. \"Uh-oh.\" Berlioz luckily missed that and Toulouse and Vincent went back to work. \"Lovely picture, Vincent.\" Duchess smiled to the brown-haired boy. \"Thank you, Duchess; I just thought about you and your kittens and decided to do a portrait for you all.\" Vincent said. \"Oh, you're very sweet for a human.\" Duchess purred. Vincent smiled as he continued. \"Aha, yeah!\" Toulouse smiled as he finished his painting. \"It's Edgar!\" Marie giggled. \"It is Edgar.\" Snow White also giggled. \"Yeah, old picklepuss Edgar!\" Berlioz laughed with the others. Soon, the puppies started to laugh with them. \"'Old Pricklepuss'?\" Duchess asked while even laughing herself, but tried not to because that was not a nice name to call somebody. \"Now, now, Berlioz, that is not kind. You know Edgar is so fond of all of us and takes very good care of us.\" \"Then why do the ends of my fur stand up when he's around?\" Snow White asked. \"It does?\" Oliver asked in concern.' \"I don't know why, but I don't trust him.\" Snow White replied. \"Something about him must be off then.\" Estelle said. Scruffy and Dot sniffed, then shrugged. \"We'll smell him later.\" Scruffy decided. \"Yeah.\" Dot agreed. Maisy soon smelled a mouse. She looked around as she followed her sense of smell for the common prey of the feline.[Chapter 5] \"Now, let's leave Toulouse and Vincent to their paintings,\" Duchess suggested. \"Now dear, you go to the piano and run along. Both of you, go ahead.\" \"Yes, Mama.\" Marie and Berlioz replied. \"Ooh, I love, love, love playing the piano with my friend Bill!\" Eloise smiled. Maisy was soon going over to a mouse hole. \"It's time to practice your scales and your arpeggios.\" Duchess told Berlioz. Maisy sniffed as she came to the mouse hole and smirked. \"Heheh, gotcha.\" \"Oh, please don't eat me!\" The mouse begged. \"Maisy!\" Duchess called. Maisy looked over to her sister. \"Please, if you see a mouse, leave him alone, that's a friend of ours.\" Duchess replied. \"Oops, sorry.\" Maisy said before placing the mouse back on the ground. The mouse gasped and backed away. \"Sorry... I didn't know you were friends with my sister, niece, and nephews.\" Maisy told the mouse. \"Y-You're Duchess's sister?\" The mouse asked. \"Yes, I am,\" Maisy replied. \"We were separated a long time ago.\" \"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.\" The mouse frowned. \"What's your name?\" Maisy then smiled. \"They call me 'Roquefort'.\" the mouse replied, smiling back. \"It's nice to meet you.\" Maisy smiled. \"Likewise.\" Roquefort smiled back. \"My name is Maisy.\" Maisy said. \"Nice to meet you, Maisy, let me know when you all have lunch, I'd like to stop by.\" Roquefort replied. \"Sure thing.\" Maisy smiled down to the mouse. The mouse soon rushed back in. Maisy came back over to her family with a smile. \"It's time to practice your scales and your arpeggios.\" Duchess told Berlioz. \"Mind if I join?\" Snow White asked. \"You may if you wish.\" Duchess allowed. \"Yay!\" Snow White smiled. She then hopped up beside Berlioz. Jenny smiled as she held Oliver in her lap as he decided to watch this time unlike in her piano lessons. Berlioz then started to crack his fingers while Marie waited for him to start playing so she could sing her song. \"Any time now.\" Snow White said patiently. \"We're ready, Maestro.\" Marie added in, but she was slowly losing her patience. Berlioz then slammed the keys which hit Marie's tail. \"Ow!\" Marie yelped. \"Mama, he did it again!\" Berlioz then hit the keys. \"Tattletale.\" 'Please start.' Snow White thought to herself. \"Now, Berlioz,\" Duchess gently told her black-furred son. \"Now, please, darling, settle down, and play me your pretty little song.\" \"Yes, Mama.\" Berlioz then gave in and played the piano keys with his front paws. 'About time.' Snow White thought to herself. \"Doe me so doe doe so me doe, Every truly cultured music student knows, You must learn your scales and your arpeggios, And the music ringing from your chest and not your nose, While you sing your scales and your arpeggios~\" Marie began to sing. Snow White smiled as she was going to sing next. \"If you're faithful to your daily practicing, You will find your progress is encouraging, Doe me so me doe me so me fa la so it goes, When you sing your scales and your arpeggios~\" Berlioz sang before Snow White. \"Doe me so doe-\" Snow White began until Berlioz played out of rhythm with Toulouse who came onto the keyboard with paint covered paws. \"Really?\" she then asked, unimpressed. Oliver went to make the brothers stop for ruining Snow White's big moment. \"Let's try that again.\" Snow White sighed. \"Don't do that ever again.\" Oliver told Toulouse and Berlioz. \"Sorry, I went overboard.\" Berlioz said. Oliver rolled his eyes. Berlioz then played the tune again, but allowed Snow White to have a part in the song. \"Doe me so doe doe so me doe, me so doe doe so me doe, Though at first it seems as though it doesn't show, Like a tree, ability will root and grow~\" Snow White began to sing. Oliver smiled as he found her singing beautiful. \"If you're smart you'll learn by heart, What every artist knows~\" Duchess, Berlioz, and Marie sang together. \"You must sing your scales~\" Duchess and Marie sang together. \"And your arpe-e-e-gios!~\" Snow White concluded. \"Beautiful.\" Oliver smiled. Snow White blushed to him with a smile back. \"Ah, good evening, my little ones.\" Edgar came in with a meal for the cats. \"Good evening, sir.\" Akito said. The others looked to Edgar. Snow White had the funny feeling again. Scruffy and Dot sniffed Edgar and now understood why Snow White had a bad feeling about him. \"Hello, children.\" Edgar greeted. \"Hello, Mr. Edgar.\" Akito replied with suspicion in his voice. \"You okay?\" Edgar asked. \"Fine and dandy.\" Akito faked a smile. Edgar gave the kids a look, but then came to the cats to give them their cream. \"The cream does look good.\" Snow White said in cat language. \"I have enough for all of you to share,\" Edgar smiled to all of the cats, including Maisy, Snow White, and Oliver. \"Your favorite dish, prepared a very special way. It's creme de la creme a la Edgar. Sleep well. I-I mean, eat, eat well, of course.\" Scruffy and Dot began to look around Edgar to see if he had any food for them. \"Are you two hungry too?\" Edgar smiled to the two puppies. Scruffy and Dot began to beg as was their dog nature. \"Well, I suppose you could have these yummy dog biscuits.\" Edgar took out a few bone-shaped treats. Weenie panted and rushed over so he could also have one. Scruffy began to sniff the dog biscuits. Edgar then left the room as the cats lapped up their cream, enjoying it very much. Scruffy, Dot, and Weenie soon ate the dog biscuits. \"I sense some trouble afoot...\" Eloise commented. \"Me too.\" Ditto said as he slithered to the top of her blonde head. Roquefort came back once he smelled their cream which made him hungry. \"Looks like a certain mouse is hungry.\" Maisy smiled. \"Please don't eat him.\" Duchess said. \"He's your friend, I wouldn't dream of it.\" Maisy promised her sister. \"You want some of the cream?\" Maisy asked the mouse. \"It's creme de la creme a la Edgar.\" Marie added with a smile. Roquefort took out a cracker and decided to join them for their cream. \"It's pretty good.\" Snow White smiled. \"Mm, this is yummy!\" Marie beamed as Roquefort dunked his cracker in the cream and found himself enjoying it just as much as the others. \"These biscuits are delicious.\" Dot smiled. \"Yeah... Very good...\" Scruffy smiled before yawning slightly. \"It's no roast beef bone, but it sure is delectable.\" Weenie agreed. The pets started to get sleepy. When the pets yawned, it made the kids yawn back. \"Knock it off, guys!\" Felicity called then. \"Yawning is catching.\" \"Sorry, but we're getting sleepy.\" Scruffy yawned. \"Maybe we should rest our eyes for a little while...\" Snow White yawned and stretched beside Marie. \"A little sleep does sound good.\" Oliver yawned. \"Come on, Weenie, we don't need naps, right?\" Eloise smiled, but then did a double take once she saw her puppy was fast asleep, she then reached into her bag and took out her Do Not Disturb sign which she usually slept with back at home and decided to let him nap. \"All right, stay out of trouble.\" she then smiled peacefully like a mother. \"Aw, they look so cute.\" Estelle whispered. \"We better let them get some rest.\" Vincent suggested as he put his paintbrush away. \"Agreed.\" Jenny whispered. The kids then left the room while the pets fell asleep. Skipperdee even fell asleep due to having a small bit of the creme with his usual raisins. \"Should we take a nap?\" Felicity asked. \"Watching these guys sleep is making me a little fatigue...\" Estelle agreed. \"Same here.\" Akito yawned. Eloise couldn't help but yawn along, though she was often restless. The kids then decided to sleep with the animals as it suddenly became a tiring evening for them all. The adults were about to come get the kids, but then saw they were asleep. \"I don't believe I've seen Eloise fall asleep so fast.\" Nanny giggled. \"Same with us with the twins.\" Atticus said. The Pokemon were also asleep with the pets. Madame Bonfamile smiled, she decided to put everyone in the proper rooms to get some sleep. And where each room was perfect. \"Thank you, Adelaide.\" Nanny smiled. \"It's no problem at all, I always enjoy good company.\" Madame Bonfamile smiled back.[Chapter 6] \"So, Natalie, Gregory, how do you know Madame Bonfamile?\" Atticus asked the parents of the girl that his oldest son had very much affection for. \"Yeah, how do you know her?\" Mo also asked. \"She used to be my nanny on her off time from work,\" Natalie smiled. \"We were close like a mother and daughter. She was also neighbors with Gregory's grandfather and they even had a party and we both happened to come at the same time and we met at the first time at age sixteen.\" \"Aw!\" Mo smiled. \"It sort of just happened,\" Natalie smiled. \"He was like a Knight in Shining Armor.\" \"So romantic.\" Mo smiled. \"You should've seen it...\" Natalie sighed in memory. \"And I know Adelaide mostly from Sir Wilkes.\" Nanny then smiled. \"Ah, yes, Willy,\" Madame Bonfamile smiled herself. \"How is the old boy then?\" Nanny blushed slightly. \"He's fine, thank you.\" \"Ooh, looks like a certain someone is in love with him.\" Madame Bonfamile smirked playfully. Nanny smiled bashfully. \"We are rawther close nowadays, he even came to visit us on Christmas Eve.\" \"That was kind of him.\" Madame Bonfamile said. \"Yes... We shared a kiss under the mistletoe as Eloise's mother was coming home.\" Nanny smiled. \"It was hard work being in Paris...\" Darla sighed. \"Sometimes I feel like they were just trying to keep me away from my own daughter, I only saw her about two or three times for the year. Sometimes I'd call in and say I'd be home in three more days, but then I'd have to call again to say 'No, I can't come home anymore, I have too much work'.\" \"That's terrible.\" Madame Bonfamile frowned. Darla frowned back and nodded. \"What was your line of work, Ms. Fudo?\" Madame Bonfamile then asked. \"I worked in the fashion industry like Christian Dior and Coco Chanel.\" Darla replied. \"Yeah.\" Atticus nodded. \"Thank Rarity.\" Mo whispered since the unicorn mare was a big influence on Darla's interest in fashion. Atticus chuckled in response. The sun was slowly going down. \"My, my, my, it's quite late,\" Nanny commented. \"Perhaps we should all turn in for the evening, we'll find a hotel.\" \"Oh, no, I insist you all stay here.\" Madame Bonfamile replied. \"Really?\" Mo smiled. \"Oh, you should,\" Madame Bonfamile smiled back. \"I do enjoy company.\" \"We wouldn't want to impose...\" Forte replied. \"Perish the thought.\" Madame Bonfamile replied back. \"Well, if you insist.\" Atticus said. Madame Bonfamile smiled and then had them all get settled in. The couples were given their own rooms to share of course. \"Would you like to stay with me?\" Madame Bonfamile asked Nanny. 'The kitties usually stay here with me, but I have extra space in my bed.\" \"Oh, yes, please.\" Nanny said. Madame Bonfamile smiled. It was a peaceful night for the most part, but for the animals, it would be far from peaceful as Edgar had other plans for them. He of course had to include the Pokemon so then there would be no witnesses. The adults were asleep, but some of them had bad feelings about what was going on. Edgar had the pets and the Pokemon in a baby basket. Luckily for him, they were all still knocked out cold from their dinner. He then got onto his motorcycle and drove off, taking them all out of Paris. He of course would have been successful if two dogs hadn't heard his motorcycle. \"Lafayette,\" one dog called to the other. \"Hey, Lafayette. Lafayette!\" The other dog came up from the hay. \"Hey, I'm right here!\" he then glared. \"Listen,\" the first dog replied. \"Wheels approaching.\" The second dog began to try to hear. \"Oh, Napoleon, we done bit six tires today,\" he then said. \"Chased four motorcars and a bicycle and a scooter.\" \"Hush your mouth!\" the other dog replied before raising an ear. \"Two-cylinder, chain drive, one squeaky wheel on the front, it sounds like.\" This sounded like something they might be able to use. They started walking together in the dark of the night. \"Now, you go for the tires, and I'll go right for the seat of the problem.\" Napoleon suggested. \"Hey, now why do you always go for the seat and I go for the tires?\" Lafeyette asked. \"'Cuz I outrank you, that's why,\" Napoleon replied. \"Now stop beating your gums and sound the attack!\" Lafayette soon started to howl. \"No, that's mess call!\" Napoleon told him. \"Made a mess of it, huh?\" Lafayette replied. \"You can be replaced, you know.\" Napoleon reminded. \"Sorry, I'll do better.\" Lafayette said. The two dogs then decided to charge. \"Wait a minute, I'm the leader!\" Napoleon stopped the other dog. \"I'm the one that says when we go. Here we go. Charge!\" The dogs then attacked Edgar on his motorcycle. And where this caught Edgar's attention. The motorcycle was coming apart and the basket fell out of Edgar's reach as the dogs threw him off. The dogs then laughed as they were able to take the motorcycle away from Edgar. Edgar was able to get his motorcycle back, but that didn't stop the dogs and it was now starting to rain. And where it started to thunder. Back in the Bonfamile mansion... The kids woke up in a room for their own and they were surprised that they were there, not remember going there, but their parents probably brought them to bed. \"I can't sleep.\" Eloise pouted as she sat up. \"How can anyone sleep with that room rumbling thunder?\" Jenny groaned as she also started to wake up. \"I know, I'd rawther hear pigeons and car horns when I go to sleep.\" Eloise glared. \"It's an earthquake! It's an earthquake!\" Felicity called nervously. Eloise bit her lip nervously then. \"Oh, wait, it's just Akito fighting in his sleep.\" Felicity then smiled. Eloise giggled. \"Felicity...\" \"The pets and Pokemon have been kidnapped!\" Akito gasped, waking up. \"What?!\" the kids asked. \"I know they have!\" Akito jumped out of bed. \"Come on, I'll show you.\" The kids then came back into the parlor room where their pets and Pokemon had been left and it was all empty. \"No one here.\" Felicity frowned as she used her night vision. \"I bet it was Edgar.\" Akito said before getting dressed at super-speed so they couldn't see him naked. Estelle had her eyes covered and then looked over to her twin brother. \"He's given me a bad vibe ever since we came here,\" Akito glared. \"And I intend on stopping him!\" \"I agree.\" Estelle said. \"Me too.\" Felicity even agreed. \"Really?\" Akito replied. \"Guys, I can-\" \"We're a team, Kito,\" Vincent put his arm around his little brother. \"Who helped Eliza when those elephants were about to march into an electric fence?\" \"We all did...\" Akito sighed. \"And who helped save Kopa and Ryan back at the zoo when they got sent to the wild?\" Eloise then quizzed. \"We all did...\" Akito replied. \"And which bunch of kids helped Jenny when her life was in danger from Mr. Sykes?\" Estelle then asked. \"We all did.\" Akito said. \"That is why we are going with you.\" Felicity said. \"All of our pets are gone and so are our Pokemon, this is a team effort.\" Vincent put his hands on Akito's shoulders. Akito then smiled. \"You're right... We're all going to do this, we're all in this together.\" \"Then we must go.\" Estelle nodded firmly. \"We better leave our parents a note in case we're away too long.\" Jenny said as she wrote down on a piece of paper. \"Good idea.\" Vincent agreed. Jenny wrote a note out and they all got dressed as they moved out into the night to find their missing pets and Pokemon.[Chapter 7] The basket was under a bridge and a thunderclap had woken up Duchess instantly. \"Oh! Oh, where am I?\" Duchess asked instantly worried and anxious. \"I am not at home at all. Children, where are you? Answer me! Berlioz? Toulouse, Marie, where are you?\" \"Duchess?! Children, where are you?!\" Maisy called out as she came out from the water. \"Maisy?!\" Duchess called. \"Oh, Duchess!\" Maisy ran over to her sister and hugged her. \"Thank Heavens.\" \"Have you seen the children?\" Duchess asked. \"Here I am, Mama and Aunt Maisy.\" Marie appeared then. \"Oh, Marie...\" Maisy comforted her niece. \"I guess I had a nightmare and fell out of bed.\" Marie pouted. \"Where are the others?\" Maisy asked. \"Mama! Aunt Maisy!\" Berlioz's voice called out. \"That's Berlioz.\" Marie recognized the sound of her brother's voice. \"Over here, darling,\" Duchess called soothingly. \"Berlioz, here we are. And don't worry, everything is going to be all right.\" \"I'm coming, Mama...\" Berlioz came over, looking very wet and miserable. \"Gee, I'm cold and w-wet... Mama?\" A frog then croaked at him. \" MAMA! \" Berlioz cried out in fright once he couldn't see his mother or anyone else he knew which worried him. The frog croaked once again. \"Mama!\" Berlioz cried out before running into the two adult female cats. \"Oh, darling, that's only a little frog.\" Duchess soothed. \"But he had a mouth like a hippopotamus.\" Berlioz replied. \"Yeah, frogs can somehow be able to do that with their mouths,\" Maisy said. \"Have you seen Snow White, Oliver, Toulouse, or the Pokemon?\" Toulouse!\" Marie called. Everyone then yelled the other orange kitten's name, but he was still in the basket and looked a little cranky from their yelling. \"Hey, what's all the yelling about, huh?\" Toulouse asked as he came out with Snow White and Oliver. \"Yeah, we're trying to get some sleep.\" Oliver yawned. \"I hate my naps to be interrupted...\" Snow White looked the most grouchy of them all. \"Why didn't you guys answer?\" Berlioz asked. \"Mama, Aunt Maisy, they've been here all the time!\" Marie firmly informed. \"Mama?!\" Teddy's voice called out from behind a tree. \"What just happened?\" Vulpix asked as he shook himself a little. \"I don't know, but I don't like it.\" Larvitar replied. \"Neither do I.\" Mismagius said. \"Same here.\" The Ralts twins added. \"Mama...\" Teddy pouted as he couldn't find Estelle anywhere. \"I was having a funny dream, Edgar was in it,\" Toulouse said once he woke up a little more. \"And we were all riding and bouncing along-\" \"I don't think it was a dream.\" Oliver said as he saw their surrounding. The frog then croaked again. \"It wasn't...\" Dot then pouted as she then came out with Scruffy and the Pokemon slowly and carefully came down the tree. \"Edgar? Oh, darling...\" Duchess replied in doubt. \"Why that's ridiculous.\" \"I know it was him, I just know it was.\" Snow White said. \"I knew I smelled something rotten in Denmark.\" Scruffy glared. \"You sure it isn't you?\" Dot deadpanned slightly. \"Maybe you guys just fell on your heads.\" Berlioz suggested. \"He must be after your mistress's money, I mean, think about it; after your mistress dies, she would leave her money and riches to you and your children and since each cat has nine lives, by the time you each died, Edgar would be gone himself by then.\" Maisy said. There was then a thunder boom heard which startled the little ones and it even made Teddy cry like a baby. \"Ah, Teddy, it's okay...\" Mismagius tried to soothe the Teddiursa. She soon then started to cradle him. Teddy cried while Mismagius soothed and gently shushed him to calm him down, he was just like a baby without his mother. \"Mama, I'm afraid, I wanna go home now.\" Marie pouted. \"Now, now, my darling, don't be frightened.\" Duchess cooed. \"We'll have to wait until the storm is over.\" Maisy said. The thunder got louder and it was enough to even startle the adult cats. \"Oh, dear, oh, dear, let's get in the basket!\" Duchess rushed. \"All of us!\" They all went into the basket to be safe and dry, luckily, the basket seemed to be big enough to fit them all. \"What's gonna happen to us?\" Toulouse pouted. \"I'm sure we'll all be just fine in here.\" Scruffy said. \"I hope everyone's okay without us.\" Weenie pouted. \"Oh, who knows how they'll react once they wake up?\" Oliver frowned. Back at the mansion... Nanny and Madame Bonfamile were fast asleep in the bed they shared together, but they were both suddenly awakened by the thunder which startled them due to how loud it was. \"Oh, my, what a storm.\" Nanny frowned. \"Oh, I had the most terrible dream...\" Madame Bonfamile held her head, she then came out of bed and looked to the area where her cats slept and then decided to comfort them as they were probably afraid of the storm as well. \"Thank goodness it was only a dream. Oh, dear, what a terrible night. Now, now, my darlings. Don't be frightened. The storm will soon pass,\" she then opened the curtain to see that the basket was gone which had terrified her instantly. \"Oh, no!\" \"M-Maybe they're just sleeping with the children.\" Nanny smiled nervously. The two older women then left the room. Madame Bonfamile was very worried for her cats. Nanny came into the room where the kids were playing earlier that day, only to find the others with a note that Jenny wrote about where she and the others would be in case they woke up, worried sick over them. \" Dear Mom, Dad, Mr. and Mrs. Fudo, and Mr. and Mrs. Forte, and Nanny and Madame Bonfamile, We're going out to save the pets and Pokemon as they have been kidnapped by someone and I'll give you a hint; his name starts with an 'E', anyways we'll be back as soon as we can. - From, Jenny.\" The note said. \"Oh, our little baby...\" Natalie sounded worried. \"There, there, sweetheart, she's a smart kid now that she's friends with Mr. Fagin.\" Gregory soothed his wife. \"Yes, but she's never been to Paris before.\" Natalie frowned. \"Alone.\" Gregory added with a just as sad frown. \"She won't be alone.\" Mo said. \"They're bright kids, they'll all be okay.\" Atticus agreed knowingly. \"Well, all right.\" Natalie sighed. Cherry didn't seem that all worried with the kids being out like Atticus and Mo. This was kind of a normal thing for them now that they could never worry when the kids would go out and have an adventure to make things right in the end just like they did back in the day. \"We should try and sleep.\" Forte said. \"How can we sleep with our children lost out there in the big world?!\" Natalie panicked. \"Now, now, now, I know that seems rash, but it'll be fine...\" Nanny put her hands on the woman's shoulders. \"It'll be all right... If I know Eloise and her cousins, things will turn up in the end, you'll see.\" \"Okay, okay...\" Natalie still sighed sadly. \"I'm sure that Vincent boy will keep a good eye on Jennifer.\" Gregory soothed his wife. \"You're quite right.\" Natalie said. Gregory smiled. \"Celestia, if you're listening, it's us...\" Atticus whispered in a prayer stance. \"Please... Watch over our children... And everyone else...\" Roquefort overheard the commotion from Madame Bonfamile and decided to try to help find Duchess and the kittens. Meanwhile with the kids... Felicity took the lead for the most part since she was born with night vision. Akito had used his magic to keep his Ponyta's flames from going out as he had brought it out to help search for the pets and the rest of the Pokemon. Jenny stayed close with Vincent and he held her protectively as they walked along together. \"Sure is darker than closing time at the Plaza around here.\" Eloise said as she held a flashlight. \"Yeah.\" Ponyta said while his flames were protected from the rain. \"You doing okay, Ponyta?\" Akito asked. \"Just fine, thanks.\" Ponyta replied. \"Well, it's a good thing I found a spell that would protect your flames from the rain.\" Akito smiled. \"I appreciate that.\" Ponyta smiled back. \"Where could they be?\" Jenny asked. \"At this rate, it'll be morning by the time we find them.\" Vincent complained as he held Jenny protectively. \"Let's check the bridge.\" Jenny said. Ponyta and Felicity then took the lead and went toward a bridge.[Chapter 8] The rain seemed to be stopping after slowing down and there were morning birds heard chirping. \"Have we really been traveling all night?\" Jenny asked in surprise. \"Sounds like it.\" Estelle said. \"This is getting us nowhere...\" Eloise sighed before sitting on the end of the bridge. \"I give up, we'll never find them.\" \"Eloise?\" Weenie's voice yawned. \"Weenie?\" Eloise looked around. Weenie came over to the blonde girl with a smile. \"WEENIE!\" Eloise squealed and hugged her dog. \"Oh, Weenie...\" \"The others are in the baby basket under the bridge.\" Weenie said. \"Come on, guys.\" Eloise said to the others as she held Weenie close in her arms. The others nodded and followed the pug dog down as they came to the basket. And where they soon heard someone singing. Weenie sniffed the basket while the kids and Ponyta looked around for the source of the singing and saw an adult orange male cat coming into the scene. They soon saw Duchess coming out to see the source of the voice. \"I like a chee-chee-chee-chee-rony, Like they make at home, Or a healthy fish with a big backbone, I'm Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley, O'Malley the alley cat!~\" the cat sang to himself. 'I've got that wanderlust, Gotta walk the scene, Gotta kick up highway dust, Feel the grass that's green, Gotta strut them city streets, Showin' off my eclat, yeah!~\" He soon saw Duchess standing next to a tree. \"Tellin' my friends of the social elite, Or some cute cat I happen to meet, That I'm Abraham de Lacy Guiseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley, O'Malley the alley cat!~\" he then finished his song with a charming smirk to the white cat. \"Why, monsieur, your name seems to cover all of Europe.\" Duchess replied. 'And he seems to be charming her.' Akito thought to himself. Thomas smiled to Duchess. The kittens were waking up from the basket as Thomas seemed to be wooing Duchess. 'That cat looks like he could be the cat I'm looking for.' Oliver thought to himself. \"Oh, boy, an alley cat!\" Toulouse cheered. \"Shh! Listen!\" Marie shushed him with her paw. Oliver soon got out of the basket and started to make his way over to the alley cat. \"Oliver, get back here!\" Marie cried out. Oliver followed Thomas's singing as Duchess smiled to him. \"What is he doing?\" Larvitar asked. The others weren't sure, but they kept watching. Thomas's eyes widened and he looked down to see Oliver nuzzling against him with a small and gentle purr. \"By any chance, are you really Thomas O'Malley?\" Oliver smiled up at the male cat. \"Uh, yes, that would be me,\" Thomas replied, not recognizing the boy kitten at first. \"What do they call you?\" \"I am now known as Oliver Foxworth.\" Oliver replied as the golden tag on his collar shined in the sun. \"Wow, that's quite a collar you got there-\" Thomas said before he remembered that name. \"Wait, did you say your name was Oliver?\" \"That would be me,\" Oliver replied. \"I dunno why, I just loved that name, Jenny gave it to me after she adopted me.\" Thomas soon saw a resemblance in him in this kitten. Oliver smiled. \"You remind me of someone...\" Thomas put his paw around the kitten. \"Me when I was that age!\" he then chuckled. Oliver laughed with him, but shrugged, not exactly getting what was so funny. 'I have to know if he remembers being in New York City.' he then thought to himself. Thomas continued to sing to Duchess which seemed to win her over and she even clapped in the end. 'But it looks like he's trying to win over Ms. Duchess.' Oliver thought to himself. \"Bravo! Very good. You are a great talent.\" Duchess clapped to Thomas. \"Oh, thank you,\" Thomas replied. \"And what might your name be?\" \"My name is Duchess.\" Duchess replied. \"Duchess, beautiful, love it,\" Thomas wooed. \"And those eyes.. Ooh. Why your eyes are like sapphires, sparkling so bright, they make the morning radiant and light.\" 'Wow, he is quite the charmer.' Oliver thought to himself. \"How romantic~\" Marie cooed. \"Sissy stuff!\" Berlioz scoffed. Duchess and Thomas seemed to be hitting it off nicely. Oliver seemed to smirk to them, he was curious about his birth mother, but he could see that Thomas seemed happier with Duchess. He just wondered if he would still love her since she had kittens. The Pokemon decided to come out of the basket. \"You gonna be okay, Teddy?\" Mismagius asked. \"I still miss my mama, but thank you for last night.\" Teddy calmed down. \"I don't think we'll need to look far for our parents/trainers.\" Larvitar said. \"Mama!\" Teddy beamed once he saw Estelle and ran toward her. \"Oh, Teddy!\" Estelle smiled as she hugged Teddy once he hugged her. \"Mama...\" Teddy nuzzled against to Estelle. \"Come here, sweetie...\" Estelle hugged him. \"When did you all get here?\" Scruffy smiled up at the kids. \"We've been travelling all night,\" Akito said as he hugged him and Larvitar in happy reunion. \"You guys really scared us.\" \"You were right by the way, Edgar is no good.\" Larvitar said as he latched onto Akito's head. \"I knew it.\" Akito said. Scruffy nuzzled up against Akito before licking his face. Akito chuckled and then picked up Scruffy and walked with them after everyone else reunited with their Pokemon and/or pets. 'He looks so much like you, Oliver.\" Jenny smiled. \"I know, right?\" Oliver smiled back up to her. \"Maybe he's your father.\" Snow White smiled at Oliver. Thomas seemed to hear those words. \"That's what Tito said.\" Oliver whispered as he remembered talking with the chihuahua back home before they came all the way over here. \"What did you say?\" Thomas asked the two kittens, wanting to know if he wasn't hearing what he thought he was hearing. \"Oh, um, Oliver misses his father.\" Snow White replied. \"What do you remember about your father?\" Thomas asked the orange kitten. \"Not too much...\" Oliver shrugged. \"I remember seeing him after my brothers and sisters finally opened our eyes, but the next thing I know, some human put us in a box and decided to put us all up for adoption.\" Thomas began to remember the day when he and his last mate had kittens in New York City. Flashback There was a black and white adult female cat. Thomas did whatever he could and then came to his mate as they were in a pizza shop together that was now closed and they were left alone in the dark in the storage closet. Thomas soon heard his mate yowl out of pain. \"Are you okay, dear?\" he then asked worriedly. \"Thomas... It's time...\" the black and white female cat bit her lip. \"What, are you sure?\" Thomas asked. \"I've never been more sure about anything else in my life!\" the black and white adult cat replied. Thomas helped his mate through labor and later on, it was around 6:00 in the morning and the pizza shop owner was opening up the place and he heard a noise in his storage closet. He then growled as he thought maybe thieves had come in, he grabbed a mop and opened the closet, only to find the black and white female cat smiling down to her black and white kittens and one orange and Thomas smiled as well. \"How did all of you get in here?\" The owner asked. The cats looked slightly nervous, mostly Thomas though since his mate was feeding their babies. \"Out, all of you, out!\" The owner said as he got the kittens and the mother in the box. Thomas ran far in a panic. \"Thomas!\" the black and white adult female cried, but winced when she tried to get up and go after him, she had just given birth after all. \"Now, you and your kittens are going to be someone else's problem.\" The owner said before placing the box in front of a store. Thomas ran into a back corner and poked his head out over to his mate. \"Oh, my...\" the black and white female cat pouted as they were thrown out like trash. \"Dear, are and the kittens alright?\" Thomas asked. The black and white female counted and checked out their kittens, then smiled wearily in relief. \"Thank goodness, they're all okay now.\" The kittens were drinking their mother's milk. \"Thank goodness that you and the kittens are okay,\" Thomas sighed out of relief before getting slapped by his mate. \"Ow! Hey, what did I do?\" he then glared slightly from the sudden slap. \"You didn't try to attack the man from taking me and the kittens and putting us into this box and then throwing us out like trash!\" The female black and white cat glared. \"Oh...\" Thomas replied. \"Sorry, babe...\" \"I thought you loved me!\" the black and white female cat glared with tears in her eyes. \"Just get out of here! The kittens will open their eyes in a few weeks and I don't want them to see you!\" \"Don't you think you're overreacting?\" Thomas winced. \"I said get out!\" The black and white cat glared. Thomas blinked, he then backed up. \"If that's what you want-\" \"Yes, it is...\" the female cat hissed. Thomas frowned, he then left down the streets, he glared back at her, but looked away as he looked like he was going to cry. \"I thought she was the one...\" he whispered to himself before he was going to start a whole new life for himself. End of Flashback We are soon shown back to where he is now. Thomas closed his eyes and then shook his head. \"Are you all right, Monsieur O'Malley?\" Duchess asked the adult male orange cat. \"You got awfully quiet all of the sudden.\" \"Sorry, I was just thinking about something.\" Thomas said. Oliver looked curious, but kept it to himself. 'This became slightly awkward.' Akito thought to himself. \"Now, uh, what's the hang-up, your ladyship?\" Thomas asked Duchess why she was out here. \"Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris,\" Duchess replied. \"So if you would be just so kind and show me the way.\" \"Show you the way? Perish the thought!\" Thomas answered. \"We shall fly to Paris on a magic carpet, side by side, with the stars as our guide, just we two.\" 'Oh, he's going to surprised.' Akito thought to himself. Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz came out of the basket and came to meet Thomas and he was shocked to find out that Duchess was actually a mother. \"Don't forget about us.\" Snow White smiled. \"Oh yes, Monsieur O'Malley,\" Duchess smiled. \"These are my children. Along with some new friends of ours and even my long-lost sister, Maisy.\" \"Hello.\" Maisy greeted. \"Oh, how sweet.\" Thomas replied. \"Do you really have a magic carpet?\" Berlioz asked. \"And are we really gonna ride it?\" Marie added in excitement. 'Looks like he might have bit more than he can chew. ' Estelle thought to herself. Snow White and Oliver chuckled as Thomas now suddenly had his paws full. \"Will your magic carpet hold all of us?\" Larvitar asked. \"Will it be like the time Maman and everyone else met Aladdin?\" Felicity asked as she twirled her finger through one of her pigtails. \"Mama, do I have sparkling sapphire eyes that dazzle too?\" Marie then asked. Thomas stammered nervously as he felt lost on what to say or do next. 'Looks like my dad is getting nervous.' Oliver thought to himself. \"No poetry to cover this situation, Monsieur O'Malley?\" Duchess asked as she smirked with her sister. \"What I had in mind was a kind of a sports model, baby,\" Thomas chuckled nervously. \"You know, one of those-\" \"A magic carpet built for two?\" Maisy teased. \"Ooh.\" Snow White and Oliver smirked. \"I wouldn't take up much room.\" Marie told Thomas. \"We understand perfectly, Monsieur O'Malley,\" Duchess sighed to Thomas and decided they should find their own way home. \"Well, come along, darlings.\" The kittens then followed her, but Toulouse wanted to see Thomas up close. \"I'm a tough alley cat too!\" Toulouse told Thomas before hissing. \"He sure is.\" Larvitar said. \"Hey there! You're comin' on,\" Thomas smiled to Toulouse. \"I'll bet you're a real tiger in your neighborhood!\" \"Yeah, that's cuz I practice all the time.\" Toulouse smiled back. \"Now, now, Toulouse, come along, dear.\" Duchess called to her orange son. \"You don't want to be left behind.\" Maisy said. \"Yes, Mama and Aunt Maisy.\" Toulouse replied as he caught up with them. \"See ya around, Tiger!\" Thomas called to him with a smile. Toulouse smiled back and kept hissing with every step he took with his friends and family to go back home.[Chapter 9] \"So, which way back?\" Scruffy asked Akito. Akito magicked up a compass and then held it in his hands. \"Should be the other way, down there.\" he then pointed to the way they had come from. \"Perfect.\" Larvitar smiled. \"If you guys wanna go back home, you'll follow Akito.\" Eloise told the others. Oliver frowned as they were leaving so soon. \"Oh, must we go back home now?\" \"What's the matter?\" Jenny asked her kitten. \"We just got here... And... I met my dad...\" Oliver sounded like he was going to cry. Akito soon got himself an idea and where he then 'accidentally' broke the compass. \"Oh, no...!\" he then called out. \"Akito?\" Vincent asked. \"It appears I have broken my compass and I forgot where to go...\" Akito acted. Jenny smiled as she saw what he did. \"Hang on, Akito, I'll give you a new one.\" Estelle said, about to use her magic. \"No, no, Estelle, we can't use our magic or any of our powers here, so we'll have to trust Mr. O'Malley to bring us home...\" Akito said before winking to her to play along. \"Understand...?\" \"Ohh.\" Estelle nodded, understanding and decided to play along. Akito smirked and nodded to her and Estelle then nodded back. \"Oh, no, did it rain last night?\" Estelle acted along herself. \"That can affect our powers.\" \"What now?\" Larvitar asked. Oliver soon decided to go and see if his father could help. Thomas went to go away. \"Da-Erm, I mean, Mr. O'Malley!\" Oliver called as he came beside the adult male cat. \"Say, you seem to know a lot about these parts, why don't you give us a paw?\" Thomas began to think about that for a moment and where it would give him the perfect chance to get close to Duchess. \"I mean, if you don't mind,\" Oliver said. \"I know about the streets myself.\" \"Is that so?\" Thomas asked him. \"Oh, yes,\" Oliver nodded. \"I'm friends with a dog pack back home.\" \"Really?\" Thomas asked, very impressed. \"Yeah,\" Oliver smiled. \"Dodger, Tito, Rita, Francis, Einstein... It's cool.\" \"And they let you in?\" Thomas then asked in surprise since he was a feline and not a canine. \"They didn't like me at first, but then they grew to love me, especially Mr. Fagin, but then I met Jenny.\" Oliver smiled at the bonding. \"Who are Mr. Fagin and Jenny?\" Thomas asked. \"That would be me, Mr. O'Malley.\" Jenny greeted. \"Oh, hello there.\" Thomas looked over. \"Such a nice specimen you are.\" Jenny smiled. \"You say that to all the tomcats,\" Thomas smiled bashfully before doing a double take. \"She speaks 'Cat'!\" \"Not just to cats, but to all animals.\" Jenny said. \"I have so many questions.\" Thomas replied. \"They'll have to wait, now, if you would be so kind to show us your 'magic carpet'.\" Jenny then said, using air quotes. \"Yeah.\" Oliver said. \"So?\" Jenny smirked to Thomas. \"Come on, guys, we're going on the magic carpet!\" Oliver called to the others. \"Yay!\" The kittens, Pokemon, and puppies cheered. \"Let's just hope our parents don't mind us being gone for a while.\" Felicity said. \"Keep your pants on, we'll be fine.\" Vincent soothed. \"I don't wear pants.\" Felicity looked down to her golden dress. \"It's a figure of speech.\" Vincent said. \"Oh...\" Felicity smiled sheepishly. \"One magic carpet coming up.\" Thomas told the others before he climbed up a tree. \"What is he doing?\" Teddy asked. \"We can only watch, Teddy.\" Estelle sighed as she wasn't sure she was going to like where this was going. There was a car riding up then as Thomas got into the tree. \"I think I know his plan.\" Akito said. \"Is he crazy?\" Scruffy asked Akito. Thomas then jumped at the windshield and screeched which startled the driver. \"I'd say yes.\" Akito said. The car then stopped and the driver looked for him, but had no luck and was starting his car again. \"All right, step lively, all aboard for Paris!\" Thomas told the others. \"Wow, that was amazing.\" Oliver smiled. \"Was it?\" Mismagius deadpanned slightly. \"Why, Mr. O'Malley, you could've lost your life!\" Duchess gasped to the adult male cat. \"So I got a few to spare,\" Thomas shrugged with a smile. \"Nuthin'.\" \"We better get in the vehicle while we still can.\" Estelle said. \"Hurry up then!\" Ditto called. They all then rushed over to the vehicle before it would drive off without them. \"Won't you come with us?\" Oliver asked Thomas. \"Oh, you don't need me along, you'll all be better off without me.\" Thomas replied. \"How can we ever thank you?\" Duchess smiled to the help. \"My pleasure entirely.\" Thomas replied as this looked like goodbye. 'This can't be goodbye.' Oliver thought to himself with a frown. The truck then started moving as Thomas told them goodbye. \"Sayonara, Mr.-\" Marie was about to say. 'Sorry about this, Marie.' Scruffy thought to himself before purposely pushing her off, knowing that Thomas would be kind enough to save a kitten in danger so he could make the adult male cat stay longer, having a feeling that he needed to be with the family. \"Oh, no, Marie has fallen off!\" he then acted. Dot gave her brother a look, having a feeling that he had pushed her off. \"Marie! Marie!\" Duchess panicked for her only daughter. Thomas then picked up Marie and helped her back into the truck. Dot soon saw why Scruffy did that. \"Oh, Marie, are you all right?\" Maisy cooed to her niece. \"Yes, Aunt Maisy.\" Marie nuzzled against her. \"Oh, thank goodness.\" Maisy sighed. \"Haven't we met before?\" Thomas smirked as he climbed into the truck. \"Oh, and I'm so very glad we did.\" Duchess replied. \"Thank you, Mr. O'Malley for saving my life.\" Marie smiled to the adult male cat. Oliver was happy that Thomas didn't leave. \"No trouble at all, little princess,\" Thomas smiled to Marie. \"And when we get to Paris, I'll show you the time of your life.\" \"Oh, I'm so sorry, but, well, we just couldn't,\" Duchess replied. \"You see, my mistress will be so worried about us. No doubt about the kids and their parents too.\" \"Well, humans don't really worry too much about their pets or children.\" Thomas shrugged. \"Hey!\" The kids glared. Thomas looked to them nervously. \"Clearly you don't know humans that well.\" Maisy told the alley cat. \"Yeah.\" Scruffy said. \"Well, I haven't been able to get to know humans better honestly.\" Thomas said. \"I didn't think I'd like humans either until I met Mr. Fagin and Jenny.\" Oliver replied as he nuzzled against the human girl who raised him now. Jenny smiled down at Oliver before petting him. Oliver purred from the petting. \"Well, looks like you're gonna stay with us after all, Mr. O'Malley.\" Eloise said as she held Weenie in her lap. \"Yeah.\" Weenie smiled. \"Sure looks that way...\" Thomas replied. \"Say, you look like that woman in the fashion industry around here: Darla Fudo.\" \"She's my mother.\" Eloise smiled. \"Oh, I see, she calls New York every day.\" Thomas smiled back. \"Once in a while.\" Eloise shrugged. \"Or else we'd miss her too, too, too terribly.\" Ditto said as he crawled on top of Eloise's head. \"I'm getting hungry.\" Larvitar said. \"Me too...\" Vulpix agreed. \"Me three...\" Teddy pouted. Meanwhile back at the mansion... Cherry looked down to a mouse who was Roquefort as he was going to the horse, she then picked him up by his tail and looked up and down to him. \"You look like The Great Mouse Detective.\" she then chuckled to the mouse's outfit. \"I was out all night looking for Duchess, Maisy, the kittens, the puppies, the Pokemon, and the children.\" Roquefort told her. \"Yes, we've heard they were missing...\" Cherry replied. \"I searched all night, but couldn't find them.\" Roquefort said. Atticus came in with the paper. \"Have you seen this? Can you believe it?\" \"Atticus, I swear, if this is another article about sneakers being on sale-\" Cherry slowly shut her eyes. \"It's not about sneakers.\" Atticus said before showing her what was on the front page. Cherry took the newspaper and looked at the front page as the mouse then moved to her shoulder. \" 'Mysterious Catnapper Abducts Family of Cats along with Strange Creatures and Dogs' .\" \"Looks like our catnapper has made the front page.\" Atticus said. \"Morning, all...\" Edgar came over. \"Oh, is the paper in?\" \"Yes, as a matter of fact it is.\" Cherry said as she showed it to him. \"Well, we better go inside and see how thee others are doing.\" Atticus said. Edgar took the paper and decided to show it to Frou-Frou while Cherry and Atticus went back inside of the mansion. Atticus decided to use his super-hearing so he could hear what Edgar was saying. Roquefort told Frou-Frou about his dilemma as Edgar came outside with the newspaper. \"Morning, Frou-frou, my pretty steed, Edgar chuckled to the horse while waving the newspaper. \"Can you keep a secret? Hmm? Of course you can. I've some news straight from the horse's mouth, if you'll pardon the expression, of course. Look, Frou-Frou, I've made the headlines. Mysterious catnapper abducts family of cats, strange creatures, and dogs. Aren't you proud of me? Atticus soon started to become angry as he now knew who the catnapper was. \"So he's the catnapper!\" Roquefort whispered to himself. \"The police said it was a professional, masterful job, the work of a genius,\" Edgar chuckled before slapping the newspaper on the horse's backside. \"No bad, eh, Frou-Frou, old girl?\" \"He shouldn't have done that.\" Atticus said. \"Mm-mm...\" Cherry shook her head firmly at Edgar, now disliking the man for obvious reasons. \"Oh, they won't find a clue to implicate me,\" Edgar continued, not realizing that he was being watched by Cherry and Atticus who haven't lost their touch even as adults which had been inherited down to their children, especially Akito. \"Not one single clue. Why, I'll, I'll eat my hat if they-My hat! My umbrella! Oh! Oh, gracious! I've got to fetch those things back tonight!\" he then rushed off, leaving the horse and mouse alone while he dashed away. \"Bingo.\" Atticus smirked. \"So, are we gonna bust him now or later?\" Cherry asked. \"Later, but it should be fun to see what happens when he tries to get his hat and umbrella back.\" Atticus said. \"Mmm... Not sure what you're going with this, but okay.\" Cherry shrugged. \"Don't worry, I just know he'll possibly be in pain when he tries to get them back.\" Atticus said. \"Sabotage...\" Cherry smirked darkly. \"Shall we tail him?\" Atticus smirked. \"Let's do it.\" Cherry agreed. \"Why that sneaky, no-good, crooked butler!\" Roquefort snapped about Edgar, coming out of Frou-Frou's oats. He soon saw Atticus and Cherry. \"Hello there.\" Frou-Frou greeted. \"Hey, girl, we heard everything...\" Cherry stroked her face gently the way her father used to when training equines himself before big and important shows. \"So, you guys talk to animals, huh?\" Frou-Frou asked once it was just them and Edgar had gone. \"Yep.\" Atticus nodded. \"Amazing...\" Roquefort whispered. \"How do you do it?\" \"Well, it's hard to say,\" Atticus shrugged. \"My mother was born a mermaid and knew all sorts of sea creatures, my dad was friends with King Arthur back in the day and his dog Dig-A-Lot who discovered Puppy Power.\" \"I'm also curious, my parents seem normal compared to his.\" Cherry added in. \"Your parents sound amazing.\" Frou-Frou said. \"Anyway, don't worry about Duchess and the others, our kids are out there and they're smarter than they look.\" Cherry said to the female horse and male mouse in reassurance. \"That's cuz they don't go to public school.\" Atticus couldn't help but joke. \"Then how did they get so smart?\" Roquefot asked. \"Oh, our children are very gifted,\" Cherry replied. \"Mo home-schools Akito, Estelle, and Vincent, Eloise is tutored, and Felicity is mentored by her father and Monsieur Webster.\" \"Interesting.\" Frou-Frou said. \"Besides, 'Kito's a lot like me and Vincent has street smarts like Mo.\" Atticus smiled. \"And he wonders why I call him 'Baby Atticus'.\" Cherry replied about Akito who was basically a seven-year-old version of Atticus. \"So, we don't need to worry?\" Roquefort asked. \"Not at all, our kids got this,\" Atticus reassured. \"And look at me and Cherry, we've been through our share of adventures.\" \"Oh, man, not just Hawaii with Lilo and Stitch, but on Hanahuna when we were with Mystery Inc when you entered the surfing contest.\" Cherry then said. \"Yeah, and I killed those waves.\" Atticus said. \"That was a crazy one and I thought after the 625 experiments, our adventures with Lilo and Stitch in Hawaii were over.\" Cherry replied. \"Same here.\" Atticus said. Frou-Frou and Roquefort smiled to Cherry and Atticus once they decided they could trust the two and their kids to bring Duchess and the kittens back home safe and sound.[Chapter 10] Back in the truck... \"Anyone for breakfast?\" Thomas asked the others since the Pokemon were already hungry enough as it was. \"I am a little hungry.\" Oliver said. \"What breakfast?\" Toulouse asked. \"Where is it?\" Marie added. \"Right under that magic carpet, nut now we have to cook up a little spell, ya know,\" Thomas replied smoothly. \"Ready?\" \"Yeah.\" Snow White nodded. The others nodded in response. \"All right, first, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose and tickle your chin,\" Thomas demonstrated with a small smirk. \"Now you close your eyes and cross your heart.\" The kittens, Pokemon, and puppies did so. Thomas then came close to a cart that was covered by a rug. The kids saw what he was doing, but they all kept quiet in order for this to work. \"And presto!\" Thomas then took the rug off to show a can of creme for the kittens. \"Breakfast a la carte.\" \"Ooh, cream!\" Snow White smiled. \"Hooray!\" Marie cheered. \"We did it!\" Toulouse beamed. \"Look, Mama, look!\" Berlioz squealed. \"This is cool!\" Oliver chuckled in excitement. \"Are you a magician?\" Dot smiled up at Thomas. \"You are amazing.\" Duchess agreed. \"True, true.\" Thomas nodded back to them, then showed a very large bone for many puppies to share by the can of creme. The three dogs then decided to gnaw at it while the cats had their creme. The puppies started to enjoy it. \"Nothing could ruin this moment...\" Felicity sighed. \"I dunno, what if the driver notices us?\" Estelle asked. \"Oh, relax, what could possibly go wrong?\" Felicity shrugged modestly. \"Not good.\" Akito sighed. \"What?\" Felicity replied. \"What did I say?\" \"You just said 'what could possibly go wrong?'.\" Vincent said. \"You just jinxed us.\" Jenny sighed. Felicity frowned at herself. The driver then noticed he had unwanted company and wanted to shoo them which reminded Thomas of the pizza guy when his kittens were born and he was asked to leave by his mate. \"Mr. O'Malley?\" Oliver asked. \"Hm?\" Thomas looked down. \"You looked like you saw a ghost.\" Oliver said as he had noticed his own father's facial expression. \"Oh... Uh... Just thinking...\" Thomas replied. \"Anyway, you're welcome for the creme, buddy.\" \"I guess so...\" Oliver hummed in response. The group then ran as the driver threw things at them, but luckily, most of them hit Akito who wasn't even hurt by them. Little did they know, they had unintentionally ended up on the railroad tracks. \"Did that driver scare you, sir?\" Snow white asked Thomas. \"Oh, it'll be all right, some humans are horrible like that,\" Thomas said, settling himself down. \"I've learned to live with them.\" \"I'll show him!\" Toulouse glared before hissing and spitting like an alley cat again. \"I think he's gone.\" Akito said. \"Cool it, you little tiger.\" Thomas chuckled to Toulouse. Oliver chuckled himself. \"Oh, I'll be so glad when we get back home.\" Duchess sighed. \"That's a long way off, so we better get moving.\" Thomas replied. \"Gee whiz! Look at that bridge!\" Scruffy cheered as he jumped on the rails. \"Come on, let's play 'Train'!\" \"Yeah!\" Dot smiled. \"Oh, be careful, you guys.\" Maisy gently warned. The kittens got in one line while the dogs got in another and they all pretended to be trains, they walked across and made train sounds as they walked across the railroad together. \"They do seem to be having a lot of fun.\" Estelle smiled. \"Let's join them,\" Eloise suggested. \"I do love to pretend.\" \"All aboard!\" Akito called. The kids then copied the kittens and dogs which made the Pokemon only do the same. They soon heard a real train whistle go off. \"Wow, whoever did that is great at pretending.\" Eloise smiled. \"Uh, Eloise? I think that was it...\" Weenie pointed ahead. \" TRAIN! \" the others screamed out of fear. \"Everyone get under the train tracks!\" Akito told them. They all rushed down under the train tracks. Oliver shook slightly and fell out of Jenny's reach. \"OLIVER!\" Jenny cried out with tears of fear and overwhelment in her eyes. \"JENNY!\" Oliver cried back before he splashed into the water. Thomas soon felt an instinct take over him when he heard Oliver fall in the water. He jumped into the water after him. Oliver gasped as he tried to get up, but the current was strong and taking him until Thomas gently bit on the scruff of his neck and climbed up to take the young one to dry safety. \"Oh, thank goodness.\" Duchess sighed out of relief as all the rest of the kittens and puppies and Pokemon were still with them under the train tracks. \"Gee, Oliver, why'd you have to fall off the bridge?\" Toulouse asked. \"Believe me, it was the last thing I wanted to do.\" Oliver glared before soon smiling up to Thomas. Thomas smiled back down to him. \"I could've sworn I saw two gooses down there.\" Oliver said once they made it to a safer land. \"Geese?\" Jenny asked. \"Yeah, they had bonnets.\" Oliver shrugged. \"Why would geese wear bonnets?\" Akito asked. \"I dunno, I wanted to ask them but I was almost drowning until my dad saved me.\" Oliver replied. \"Hey, maybe they can help us get back home.\" Maisy suggested. \"Wait, did you just call Mr. O'Malley your dad?\" Toulouse asked. \"Um... Well...\" Oliver stammered, not realizing he had done that. \"Because he's his father.\" Scruffy said. Oliver chuckled sheepishly. \"You have a son?\" Duchess asked Thomas. Thomas soon revealed that he once did have kittens and a mate and told them why he left his mate and his kitten. Duchess had to admit, she was surprised and a little overwhelmed. She then could see that maybe it was for the best that Thomas seemed to be in love with her truthfully, even if he had a different story back in New York City before coming to Paris. \"You sure have grown, little guy.\" Thomas smiled down at Oliver. \"I just wonder why no one else wanted me when they would take my brothers and sisters...\" Oliver pouted. \"Perhaps it was because of destiny.\" Estelle said. \"I dunno...\" Oliver sighed. \"It's in the past, you don't have to worry about it anymore.\" Maisy soothed. \"Now, let's find those geese to give us a way home.\" Duchess suggested. The Pokemon agreed. They all went to where the twin geese were and they did in fact have bonnets on their heads, one pink and the other blue. \"Let's see if they can give us directions.\" Estelle said. \"If you insist.\" Thomas replied.[Chapter 11] \"What beautiful countryside, Abigail,\" one goose with the pink bonnet said to the other. \"So much like our own dear England.\" \"Oh, indeed, yes. Amelia, if I walk much farther I'll get flat feet.\" the goose with the blue bonnet replied. \"Abigail, we were born with flat feet.\" the pink bonneted goose replied. This made them both laugh. \"Um, excuse me, ladies?\" Estelle asked. \"I say, look at that.\" Abigail said to her sister. \"A human speaking to us as though she can understand us.\" Amelia agreed. \"Actually, I can,\" Estelle replied to the twin geese. \"It's a long story, but I was born with it like my brothers.\" \"Hi.\" Akito greeted. This surprised the geese twins in an instant. \"This is surprising, right?\" Scruffy asked. \"Oh, I'll say.\" Abigail replied. \"Indeed.\" Amelia agreed. \"You get used to it, um, where are you ladies headed?\" Scruffy smiled politely to the geese. \"We're on our way to Paris.\" \"Oh, how nice!\" Abigail beamed. \"We're going to Paris ourselves.\" \"Why don't you join us?\" Amelia invited. \"We'd love to.\" Maisy smiled. \"Yes, I think that's a splendid idea.\" Duchess agreed. \"Of course, we'd love to take you and your husband.\" Amelia then said, thinking that Duchess and Thomas were a couple. This caused Duchess and Thomas to blush. \"Actually, they're not a couple,\" Snow White replied with a small giggle. \"But me and Oliver are.\" \"Love... Yuck!\" Scruffy rolled his eyes with a scoff. \"You won't think it's gross for long.\" Dot said. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you sound just like Mom and Aunt Danielle...\" Scruffy rolled his eyes. The geese soon got them all into lines of two. \"Do we have to quack?\" Felicity asked. Eloise giggled. \"That's ducks, Felicity.\" \"No, you don't have to honk.\" Mismagius chuckled to her trainer. \"Whew.\" Felicity sighed. \"Everybody lined up?\" Amelia asked as she stood beside Abigail. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Estelle said. \"Mama, do we have to waddle like they do?\" Berlioz asked once they started walking. \"Yes, dear, think goose.\" Duchess replied. \"Yes, think like a goose.\" Maisy said. \"When we get to Paris, you must meet Uncle Waldo.\" Abigail said as they walked. \"Waldo?\" Thomas asked, confused. \"Yes, he's our uncle,\" Amelia replied. \"Now that leaves Mr. O'Malley.\" \"Yep.\" Oliver nodded. \"We are to meet Uncle Waldo at le Petit Cafe.\" Amelia told the others. \"Sounds exotic.\" Eloise smiled at the name. \"It sure does.\" Jenny said. \"Le Petit Cafe? Oh, that's that famous restaurant,\" Duchess smiled. \"Ah, c'est magnifique.\" Later on at said restaurant... \"Sacre blue! Ow! Oh! He bit my finger! Get out! Go! Go! Get out! Scram!\" a chef yelled out. A male goose with a hat then rushed out of the restaurant as he was kicked out. \"Good riddance!\" the chef grumbled. The goose sighed and put his hat on and he appeared to be missing some tail feathers and where he seemed to be drunk. \"Why, it's Uncle Waldo!\" Abigail beamed. Waldo screamed at first, but then looked to see the twins which made him smile instantly. \"Abigail! Amelia! My two favorite nooses!\" \"Uncle Waldo, I do believe you've been drinking.\" Amelia noted. \"Oh, dear!\" Abigail gasped to her uncle's bottom. \"What happened to your lovely tail feathers?\" \"Girls, it's outrageous!\" Waldo hiccuped to them. \"Why, you won't believe what they tried to do to your poor old Uncle Waldo. Look. Look at this! Prime Country Goose a la Provencal stuffed with chestnuts and basted in white wine.\" \"Yikes.\" Akito said. \"Basted? He's been marinated in it.\" Thomas commented. Oliver chuckled quietly to him. \"Dreadful! Being British, I would have preferred sherry.\" Waldo then said before he then laughed with his nieces. \"Wow.\" Akito said. \"Oh, Uncle Waldo, you're just too much.\" Amelia smiled. \"You mean he's had too much.\" Abigail smirked. \"I have to agree with them.\" Vincent whispered. The Pokemon stared curiously to Waldo, wondering why he was acting so strange. Their trainers/parents began to explain why. \"Ohh...\" the Pokemon then said. \"You know something?\" Thomas chuckled. \"I like Uncle Waldo.\" \"Especially when he's marinated!\" Duchess laughed in agreement. \"Should we go up to the roofs?\" Teddy asked. \"Ooh, I can do that.\" Mismagius smirked as she picked up Felicity and hovered. \"Show-off...\" Teddy pouted. \"Come on up, you guys!\" Oliver called as he hopped easily due to being a cat. \"Oh, come on!\" Larvitar groaned. Akito sighed as he then took a quick stretch. \"Let me help you guys.\" They all then climbed up to the roof tops with help and they kept going on to make it back home to Paris. Meanwhile at the horse stables... \"Oh, girl, I do hope Eloise is fine...\" Nanny said as she gently stroked Frou-Frou's nose. \"That girl is my whole world.\" \"Oh, don't worry, my dear, she is perfectly safe with the rest of the children.\" Frou-Frou assured her in horse language. Nanny gently stroked the horse. \"You really are lovely, lovely, lovely.\" Frou-Frou smiled. Nanny then gave the horse a carrot and left the stables as she sighed, deeply concerned about Eloise since she had been helping raise the girl since she was just a baby. Roquefort rushed in just as Nanny left. \"Frou-Frou, here comes Edgar!\" he told the horse. \"We're ready.\" Atticus whispered as he had shrunk himself and Cherry into Frou-Frou's mane. \"Was this really necessary?\" Cherry coughed from suffocation. \"This way, we can follow him without him seeing us.\" Atticus said. Cherry sniffled and soon settled down. \"Hurry, Roquefort, hop aboard the motorcycle and for goodness sake's, do be careful!\" Frou-Frou told the mouse. \"Wait, he's going to use the motorcycle?!\" Cherry asked them before glaring at Atticus. Guess I didn't think of that...\" Atticus smiled nervously. They soon dropped down into the head light of the motorcycle. \"I'm gonna kill you after this.\" Cherry narrowed her eyes at Atticus. Atticus soon smiled nervous to her. \"Frou-Frou, tonight Operation: Catnapper will be completed, wish me luck,\" Edgar said as he came in with a fishing pole to get to his motorcycle. \"Fisherman's luck.\" 'Here we go.' Atticus thought to himself. The motorcycle then started up and Edgar went off with his unknown company. \"Bye, Frou-Frou!\" Roquefort called before he accidentally fell off the motorcycle on the way. Atticus soon used his magic to teleport the mouse back to them. \"Phew!\" Roquefort then looked relieved. \"That could've been messy.\" \"Yeah.\" Atticus sighed. \"Here we go,\" Cherry said as Edgar started his motorcycle. \"Why don't you pummel this guy right here and now?\" \"Oh, sure and then get arrested for beating someone up who the police don't know is the catnapper.\" Atticus said. \"Your point?\" Cherry replied. \" CHERRY! \" Atticus then yelled, but luckily it wasn't loud enough for Edgar to hear. \"All right, fine.\" Cherry then said. \"He's right; they don't know that Edgar is the catnapper and they'd put him in jail for hurting Edgar.\" Roquefort said. \"All right, all right, I just thought I'd save us all the trouble.\" Cherry shrugged. \"We'll have to do this the long way.\" Atticus said. \"Atticus Fudo, super amazing and incredible, takes solutions slowly.\" Cherry droned. \"Just relax.\" Atticus said. Cherry then kept her eyes forward as Edgar drove in his motorcycle. Edgar kept driving and seemed to pass by the dogs from earlier. \"I have a bad feeling about this.\" Cherry said. \"You always have a bad feeling...\" Atticus sighed.[Chapter 12] At the windmill, Napoleon and Lafayette were fast asleep so far. And where Napoleon was wearing the hat while Lafayette was sleeping in the baby basket. Edgar went by them, but his shoes started to squeak slightly. \"Lafayette, Lafayette, listen!\" Napoleon woke up then. \"This should be fun.\" Atticus said. \"Mm-hmm...\" Cherry hummed. The dogs interacted and they then decided to mess around with Edgar. He seemed to have a lot of bad luck with those two dogs. And where Edgar got his hat, umbrella, and baby basket back while the two dogs were asleep. However, his hat fell onto Lafayette on the way. \"That's my hat, I'm the leader!\" Napoleon glared. 'That did go well as he had planned.' Atticus thought to himself with a smirk. Cherry smirked with Atticus as Edgar was getting hit by karma with the two dogs. And where the dogs were even going to bite him. \"Bite him!\" Atticus jeered. \"Scratch him!\" Cherry also jeered. Edgar then found a way to make the dogs fall asleep until he backed up and his motorcycle horn was accidentally beeped unluckily for him which then woke the dogs up again. \"Bite him in the butt!\" Atticus jeered. \"Kick him where it hurts!\" Cherry laughed. Atticus smiled since Cherry was having a good time. Edgar was not having any luck with either of the dogs. Cherry and Atticus had fun with this and Atticus even took out popcorn for both of them to share. \"Popcorn?\" Atticus asked Cherry. \"Please,\" Cherry replied. \"How much butter?\" \"Extra just how you like it.\" Atticus smiled. \"Thanks.\" Cherry took it and instantly ate the popcorn. Atticus and Cherry were now enjoying Edgar's pain. Edgar ended up in the hay which then made the dogs go after him. Atticus and Cherry even recorded all of this so they would have both evidence and a hilarious video to watch. \"We should show this to the kids when they come home.\" Cherry suggested. \"Yeah.\" Atticus nodded. \"I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him!\" Lafayette cheered. \"Ow, that's me!\" Napoleon grunted in pain. Edgar managed to get away, much to Cherry and Atticus's dismayed chagrin. \"Shall we continue recording?\" Atticus smirked. \"Might as well.\" Cherry replied. Little did the dogs know, Edgar was escaping from the two dogs. \"Or not.\" Atticus smirked as he could smell the dogs' breaths. \"Atticus, Edgar is getting away!\" Cherry said. Atticus soon teleported them back in the head light. \"Back to work?\" Cherry asked. \"Back to work.\" Atticus replied. They then stayed put as Edgar was getting away, but they were just one step ahead of him and he didn't even know it.[Chapter 13] Back on the rooftops... \"I'm getting tired...\" Oliver pouted to Thomas. \"We should probably stop for the night.\" Thomas decided. \"That sounds like a good idea.\" Snow White yawned. \"Thomas, Madame will be so worried,\" Duchess frowned. \"Are you sure we can't get home tonight?\" \"Mama, I'm tired.\" Marie said. \"Me too, and my feet hurt.\" Berlioz added. \"All of us are bushed.\" Akito yawned. \"Yeah, it is pretty late.\" Thomas agreed. \"We should stop for the night.\" Vulpix stretched and then scratched his ear with his back hind leg. \"I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.\" Toulouse groaned. \"If only there was some place to stop for the night.\" Teddy yawned. \"Come on, let me find a place for us all.\" Thomas offered. \"Okay.\" Akito said. \"It'll be okay, sweethearts.\" Maisy soothed her nephews and niece. Thomas began to look around. Oliver looked with his biological father. \"How much further is it, Mr. O'Malley?\" Dot asked as she walked with Scruffy and Weenie. \"Keep your bows on, Princess,\" Thomas replied. \"It's just beyond the next chimney pot.\" \"I agree.\" Oliver said, believing his father. \"Well, there it is,\" Thomas then welcomed them after a little while. \"My own penthouse pad. It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's peaceful and quiet.\" As if on cue, a trumpet horn was blown. \"Quiet, huh?\" Felicity deadpanned. \"Oh, no, sounds like Scat Cat and his gang.\" Thomas remarked. \"Scat Cat?\" Oliver smiled, liking the name. \"They're old buddies and the're real swingers.\" Thomas smiled as well. \"Swingers?\" Duchess asked. \"What exactly is a swinger?\" \"I believe that's what they call Garfield on Thanksgiving.\" Maisy said to herself. \"Yeah, what are swingers?\" Dot asked. \"You know, uh, not exactly your type, Duchess,\" Thomas got nervous then. \"Maybe we'd better find another place, huh?\" \"Oh, no, no, no, I would like to see your pad, and meet your Scat Cat.\" Duchess insisted. 'Sounds like she wants a taste of the wild side.' Maisy thought to herself. \"Well, okay.\" Thomas said to Duchess as he led them to meet Scat Cat and the others. \"Reminds me of Nicole during our Welcome to Spring party.\" Eloise said to Akito, Estelle, Vincent, and Felicity. Once they got to the opening, they looked inside and where Maisy saw her mate. \"Hey, Scat Cat!\" Thomas called from the roof window as Oliver stood beside him. \"Blow some of that sweet stuff my way!\" 'These cats seem nice.' Estelle thought to herself. Maisy looked drawn to the other cats in the building. \"Maisy, are you all right?\" Duchess asked her sister, not realizing she had found her long-lost mate. \"Sorry, Duchess, but I think Tom is in there.\" Maisy said as she pointed inside. \"Tom?\" Duchess replied. \"Yes, my old friend Tom,\" Maisy smiled. \"He was friends with a mouse like you guys, but his name was Jerry.\" \"Were you and Tom close?\" Vincent asked. \"Oh, yes, very,\" Maisy replied softly. \"I can't remember what split us apart though.\" \"Split you apart?\" Eloise asked. \"Something happened and we hadn't seen each other in a while, I of course focused on my work with the Pound Furries...\" Maisy sighed. \"I surely missed him.\" Tom soon looked up and he soon saw Maisy and where he couldn't help but stare at her. \"Tom...\" Maisy whispered from her position. \"Maisy...\" Tom whispered himself as he noticed the white cat he hadn't seen in years. Maisy soon slipped and fell into Tom's strong arms. \"Whoa!\" both cats called until Tom carried her as he stood on two legs and their eyes locked into each other's. \"Oh, um, hello, Tom.\" Maisy said. \"Maisy, long time no see,\" Tom smiled. \"How long's it been, would ya say?\" \"Far too long,\" Maisy replied. \"You still keeping in touch with Jerry?\" \"Yeah.\" Tom nodded. \"Oh, that's good... So, you're in a group now?\" Maisy asked. \"It's a long story.\" Tom replied as he set her down on the ground safely. \"It's been a while since we last saw each other.\" Maisy said. \"I'll say,\" Tom agreed. \"Oh, it reminds me of when Jerry and I had our first adventure with Patch... Our owners moved away without us.\" \"Oh, Tom, that sounds terrible,\" Maisy frowned. \"You never told me about that.\" \"I didn't want ya to worry, on the bright side, we got to meet Robyn.\" Tom shrugged. \"True.\" Maisy said before seeing the Pound Furries tag around Tom's neck. \"Your tag...\" she then pointed out. \"Oh, this old thing?\" Tom smiled. \"What about it?\" \"When did you join the Pound Furries?\" Maisy smiled. \"Oh, a while back, I'll tell ya later, let's get you guys inside first.\" Tom decided. Maisy smiled to him, he hadn't changed at all, except for the living in Paris. \"You remind me of a cat girl I saw around these parts called Mewsette.\" Tom said to Duchess with a smile. \"Who?\" Duchess asked. \"I've heard of her, but she's a very pretty cat in these parts, she reminds me of Toodles Galore.\" Tom said. Maisy gave him a look. \"It was before we met!\" Tom defended so Maisy wouldn't get angry or jealous because of an old flame. \"My old buddy Butch and I used to fight over her, but it's all in the past!\" \"That's what I thought.\" Maisy said. Tom smiled nervously and then wiped his head in relief. Scat Cat walked over. \"Say, Tommy Boy, who's this lady?\" \"This is Maisy, my girl.\" Tom put his arm around Maisy with a smile. \"Former girl.\" Maisy said. \"Former girl?\" Tom asked as he then let go of her. \"I told you, Toodles was in the past, we had a thing going on back when we were young.\" \"Remember when we broke up?\" Maisy asked. \"I thought maybe you were over that?\" Tom pouted. \"I'm glad to see you, but please respect my wishes...\" Maisy replied. \"We can still be friends though.\" Tom then sighed in defeat. \"Ah, okay...\" They all soon started to party. Scat Cat and his group then began to play a song for everybody to dance to. Even the kids, puppies, and Pokemon enjoyed it very much. And where it would have went out all night if Scat Cat and his crew hadn't fallen to the bottom. \"Oh, no!\" Oliver panicked. Luckily, none of them were hurt. Snow White winced before looking down and then breathed in relief. \"That was a fun song.\" Eloise giggled. \"It was even better than Monsieur Fife's melodies around the holidays.\" Felicity agreed. The kids soon got tired. \"I'd say it's time for bed.\" Duchess commented. \"Mm-hmm.\" Maisy agreed with her sister. \"At least let me help you all get to bed.\" Tom offered. \"It sure would be nice to help.\" Vincent yawned. \"We've had a long day.\" Jenny nodded. \"Well, alright.\" Maisy said. \"Come, we must rest.\" Duchess told her sister. Maisy nodded in agreement. The kids came close to their Pokemon and pets. \"Okay, guys, time for some rest.\" Akito said as he took out his Pokeball. \"Okay.\" Larvitar yawned before seeing that Ponyta was trying to join them. The kids then returned their Pokemon to their Pokeballs so they could get some sleep themselves. \"Time for sleep.\" Estelle yawned. Duchess gathered her kittens together while Tom helped Maisy with Oliver and Snow White. \"Happy dreams, my loves.\" Duchess cooed to her kittens as they started to fall asleep. \"Night.\" Snow White yawned. Oliver yawned as he seemed to cuddle up against Snow White in their sleep. Duchess smiled, she then decided to see Thomas as he was up on the rooftops. And where Tom and Maisy began to watch how this would go. \"I worry about my sister.\" Maisy said. \"You should, she's your sister,\" Tom understood. \"I haven't spoken to my sister in years.\" \"Really?\" Maisy asked. Tom slowly nodded. \"Hm... Well, if you'll excuse me.\" Maisy replied. \"Go ahead.\" Tom allowed her to have her space. The kittens seemed to be awake as they went to see what was going on. \"I'll bet they're on that magic carpet right now.\" Thomas said as Duchess joined him on the roof. \"They could hardly keep their eyes open,\" Duchess smiled. \"Ah, such an exciting day.\" 'I just know that they are in love.' Maisy thought to herself. The kittens seemed to sneak over so they could watch with their Aunt Maisy. The puppies soon joined them. Thomas told Duchess that he actually liked the kittens, especially Oliver since he was his son after all. Oliver was happy to hear this. \"You know, they need-Well, you know, a sort-Well, a sort of a-well, a father around.\" Thomas said to Duchess slightly nervously. \"Oh, Thomas, Thomas, that would be wonderful,\" Duchess replied. \"Oh, darling, i-if only I could.\" \"Uh-oh, I don't like how she said it like that.\" Oliver whispered. \"But why can't you?\" Thomas asked. \"Because of Madame,\" Duchess frowned. \"I-I could never leave her.\" 'I was afraid of that.' Dot thought to herself. Scruffy whimpered slightly himself as he had high hopes for Thomas and Duchess. Oliver had high hopes for them too. \"Well, we almost had a father,\" Berlioz frowned before looking to Oliver since Thomas was his biological father. \"Another brother too.\" \"Yeah, let's go back to bed.\" Toulouse replied. \"Yeah.\" Scruffy frowned. \"I almost had a mother...\" Oliver whispered with tears in his eyes. The kittens and puppies soon went back to bed. \"Good night, Duchess.\" Thomas told the prim and proper white cat. \"Good night, Thomas.\" Duchess replied to the alley orange cat. 'She might miss Madame, but she's also going to miss Thomas.' Maisy thought to herself.[Chapter 14] The next morning, the sun was almost coming up... \"Wake up, guys,\" Tom told the others. \"Thomas found a way to get you guys home in a snap.\" \"Great.\" Oliver frowned. \"Thank you, Mr. Tom.\" Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse told the gray tomcat. \"Oh, Weenie, I do wish we could help them, this is rawther sad.\" Eloise pouted. \"It really is.\" Weenie frowned in agreement. \"Come along then, Skipperdee will be glad to see us.\" Eloise then put her dog's leash around his collar and walked with him. \"Yeah.\" Weenie nodded. \"Come on, Weenie, it's time to go back home to Nanny and Mother.\" Eloise nodded back. They all soon made their way back to Madame BonFamile. \"Hey! Mee-oww! What a classy neighborhood,\" Thomas commented. \"Dig these fancy wigwams.\" \"Wigwams?\" Maisy asked confused. \"Are you sure we're on the right street?\" Thomas asked Duchess. \"Yes. Yes!\" Duchess replied. \"Let's hurry, we're almost home.\" \"Yeah.\" Dot nodded back. Roquefort took a look and noticed that the cat family was coming back and thankfully for him, they were all alive and not at all hurt. And where he saw the puppies and other kittens and cat and kids were also still alive. \"Should you guys take out your Pokemon now?\" Jenny asked. \"Might as well.\" Vincent said as he took out Vulpix's Pokeball. \"Yeah.\" Akito, Estelle, and Felicity agreed as they brought out their Pokemon Pokeballs. They then threw their Pokeballs to take out their Pokemon. \"Are we home yet?\" Teddy asked. \"See for yourself.\" Estelle pointed to the mansion with a smile. \"Finally.\" Teddy smiled. \"We're almost there, Teddy.\" Estelle hugged her Teddiursa. \"Hooray, we're home!\" Berlioz cheered. \"Wait for me, wait for me!\" Marie rushed over. \"Me first! Me first!\" \"Age before beauty!\" Snow White added. \"Wait for us!\" Larvitar called out. \"I'm gonna beat you guys!\" Oliver laughed as he teased Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse by running ahead like a brother would. \"We better keep up with them.\" Maisy said. The kittens came up to the entrance first as they were followed behind the puppies. \"What's wrong?\" Weenie asked. \"It's locked.\" Berlioz pouted. \"Allow me to get the door.\" Scruffy said. The kittens stepped aside. Scruffy then stood up on his hind legs and took quick stretches and he came up to the door to handle the lock for them. The puppy soon used his strength to pushed cat door open for them. The kittens smiled to him. Little did the know, that this was only a trap. \"Don't come in! Go away!\" Roquefort told the kittens nervously. \"Did someone just say go away?\" Scruffy asked confused. \"Look, there's Roquefort!\" Oliver pointed. \"Hi, Roquefort!\" the kittens greeted their best mouse friend. \"Hey there, Roquefort.\" The Pokemon also greeted. \"He's sure glad to see you guys, I wonder where Skipperdee is?\" Weenie smiled. \"I don't know.\" Scruffy said. \"I don't know what to say. I only wish that I-\" Duchess said to Thomas as this looked like goodbye. \"Maybe a short, sweet goodbye would be easiest.\" Thomas suggested. \"I'll never forget you, Thomas O'Malley,\" Duchess said as she joined her sister and children. \"Bye.\" \"So long, baby.\" Thomas smiled as he then went to take his leave. \"I wonder why the cat door was locked?\" Dot said as her brother had successfully got the cat door open with his strength. \"Good question.\" Scruffy agreed. \"Duchess, wherever have you been?\" Edgar faked a smile as the cat family, puppies, and Pokemon came inside just as the kids were following behind. Akito could see Edgar was faking his smile and where he was going to warn the others. \"Look out for the-\" Roquefort tried to warn before suddenly... \"The sack.\" Thomas kept going away, he hadn't seen that, so he decided to move on back to his life in Paris after leaving New York City. \"Hey, you bully!\" Eloise glared with Akito. \"That wasn't nice! You're going to be in big trouble! My mother knows everybody important!\" \"Yeah, let our pets and Pokemon go!\" Jenny even glared at Edgar. \"Oh, I don't think I will, you silly children.\" Edgar glared with an evil smirk. \"Oh, yes, you will!\" Akito jumped onto his back. \"Get off me, you brat!\" Edgar glared. \"NO!\" Akito glared back. \"Give up! You can't beat Akito Fudo and his family!\" Felicity even hissed out of vengeance. \"You let my Mismagius go, you mean man!\" \"Yeah, or else!\" Vincent glared back. \"Such tough children you claim to be.\" Edgar replied. \" CLAIM?! \" Akito snapped, he then grabbed onto Edgar's neck. \"One false move and I could knock you out for life.\" \"Oh, but if you do that, then the Madame would be shocked to see what you were doing.\" Edgar smirked. Oliver had made a hole for the cat family to all from the inside and where he was the first to get out without Edgar noticing. Akito's eyes widened, he then frowned as he slowly slid down in defeat. \"He's right...\" he said to the others. \"Kito!\" the others cried out as Akito gave up. \"Guys, Madame Bonfamile doesn't know us that well,\" Akito replied. \"I don't want us to get in trouble with her since we're guests in her home.\" He soon saw Oliver out of the bag and where he decided to distract Edgar long enough for the rest of the pets and the Pokemon to escape. \"Guys, we're just no match, he's too smart for us.\" he then said to the others. \"Akito, are you saying you don't have a plan?\" Vincent gaped at his younger brother. \"I'm saying this man is too smart for us so there is no need for 'escape' .\" Akito said through his teeth. \"You can't give up, you're Akito Fudo.\" Eloise replied. \"I'm sorry, guys, but there's no chance we can 'get away freely '.\" Akito continued, hoping they would get the gist. They soon started to not believe this, but then they saw what was going on with the bag and decided to go along. \"Get it now?\" Akito said through his teeth with a wink. \"Uh-huh!\" the others quietly agreed now that they understood fully what was going on. \"Oliver, go and get your father.\" Duchess whispered. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Oliver whispered back with a nod as he then went off. And where he then escaped quietly and swiftly so Edgar wouldn't hear. He had really learned a lot from being a cat and being in Dodger's gang before Jenny adopted him as her pet. Thomas was almost out of the home grounds until Oliver ran in front of him and stopped. \"Hey, kiddo.\" \"Dad, you have to go back, Ms. Duchess and the others are in grave danger!\" Oliver told his father. \"What?!\" Thomas ask out of shock. \"Edgar's no good, I can feel it like Weenie, Scruffy, and Dot.\" Oliver nodded firmly. \"You are indeed one of Dodger's gang, you got doggone instincts in your feline blood,\" Thomas narrowed his eyes. \"How did you escape though?\" \"I know this sounds crazy, but it was like magic,\" Oliver replied. \"Edgar wants to get rid of all of us so he can have Madame Bonfamile's fortune.\" \"Well, we aren't going to let him get his way.\" Thomas said. \"No, we're not.\" Another male voice said. Oliver looked behind himself to see a grey cat it was Ace, the leader of the Pound Furries, along with Scat Cat and his crew. \"Wow, it's Ace!\" he then cheered. \"I've heard so much about you.\" \"Hey, kiddo.\" Ace smiled down to the orange kitten and gave him a low-paw. \"Scat Cat, nice to see you help too.\" Thomas smiled to one of his oldest friends. \"Well, once Ace came and informed me that a member of his crew was in trouble; I just knew that he'd need some help.\" Scat Cat smiled. Roquefort rushed over and then stopped. \"It's okay, Roquefort, I got us some help.\" Oliver smiled to the mouse. \"Thank goodness.\" Roquefort sighed out of relief. \"Don't eat him.\" Oliver warned the other cats since Roquefort was a mouse. \"We won't, right guys?\" Ace asked the alley cats. Scat Cat and his gang looked tempted, but they backed off once they saw Oliver meant business, even for a kitten. \"We have to hurry though Akito and the others are distracting Edgar.\" Oliver said. \"You got it, kid.\" Ace nodded. Oliver nodded back. \"This way!\" he then gestured back to the mansion. All of the cats soon ran towards the mansion. Oliver led the way which made Thomas very proud.[Chapter 15] Madame Bonfamile was sure she heard the kids and the others come back, but since she didn't see them, she thought maybe she was just imagining things. \"Uh, Madame Bonfamile; would you mind if we all go out for a bit to get some fresh air?\" Darla suggested, having a feeling that it wasn't the old woman's imagination. \"Yes, yes, yes, fresh air always does me good.\" Nanny agreed. \"I don't know...\" Madame Bonfamile sighed. \"Please Madame Bonfamile.\" Mo begged. Madame Bonfamile sighed. \"First, some water.\" \"Here you go.\" Atticus handed her a glass of water from nowhere to hurry her up as he had a feeling that the kids and the others were very near. \"Thank you.\" Madame Bonfamile said before accepting the water and drinking it. Atticus smiled to her. \"Come on then.\" Madame Bonfamile then stood up and walked out with them. Gregory was encouraging his wife to do the same so she wouldn't worry herself sick over their only child. They soon heard a commotion go on and went to see what it was. \"It's okay, Nat.\" Gregory coaxed to his wife as he helped her out. They soon saw Edgar fighting off all the cats and kittens and puppies and Pokemon and kids. Snow White hissed as she was the most angry with Edgar. \"What a girl.\" Oliver whispered. \"I should have drowned you stupid animals on that night when I catnapped you all!\" Edgar glared at the pets and pokemon. \"Then when Madame Bonfamile would die; I would get everything, the money, the mansion, everything!\" \"What?!\" Madame Bonfamile glared. This caused everyone to stop in their tracks as if they were hit on pause. \"That sounds vaguely familiar somehow...\" Darla whispered to herself. \"Edgar...?\" Madame Bonfamile asked, both hurt and angry that her faithful butler could say such a thing. \"Um, Madame, I, uh, I can explain.\" Edgar smiled nervously. \"You're under arrest.\" Atticus said as he took out his detective badge. \"You can arrest people?\" Cherry looked at him in slight deadpan. \"Well, he is a detective.\" Gregory said. \"I'll take it from here, ma'am.\" Atticus told Madame Bonfamile. \"Oh, yes, please do take him away.\" Madame Bonfamile agreed. Atticus did so and where Edgar was soon placed under arrest. Edgar grumbled to himself as he was put under arrest. \"I guess I'll need a new inheritance after the cats pass,\" Madame Bonfamile replied, then looked to Natalie and Gregory. \"Would you two be interested?\" \"We'd be honored.\" Natalie smiled. \"That's very generous of you.\" Gregory added, feeling touched that she would trust them with her estate. Oliver soon began to push Thomas over to Madame Bonfamile with a little help from the kittens and the alley cats. Thomas blinked and then looked down curiously. Oliver purred to Madame Bonfamile as she showed her Thomas. \"Madame Bonfamile? Thomas here doesn't have a home and where him and Duchess have really hit it off, if you know what I mean.\" Jenny smiled. \"Thomas? Oh, what a nice name for a nice seeming street cat.\" Madame Bonfamile replied. Thomas smiled as he was going to be a new member of the family which meant that Duchess had a new mate and the kittens were going to have a father again. \"He'll need to be groomed of course though.\" Madame Bonfamile then smiled as she pet Thomas since the cats loved him. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Jenny nodded back. Madame Bonfamile then hugged Jenny. Jenny smiled as she hugged her back. Natalie and Gregory smiled at that as Madame Bonfamile treated Jenny like the granddaughter she never had. Edgar felt defeated as he was taken away and he very much deserved this. After some grooming and bathing, Thomas was now officially a part of Duchess's family and was her new mate. \"This calls for a new family portrait.\" Vincent smiled as he took out his paintbrush. \"I agree.\" Madame Bonfamile smiled. \"Please, allow me.\" Vincent said as he decided to paint his own portrait of the family as his gift before they would take a professional photograph. \"I'm sure that they would appreciate it.\" Madame Bonfamile said. Oliver was included in the portrait. Vincent smiled as he painted the family with his art skills and the magic from the paintbrush. \"I hope they don't make Oliver choose whether to stay here or with Jenny.\" Snow White hoped. \"You sure are an excellent artist, Vincent.\" Natalie smiled. \"All in a day's work.\" Vincent smiled back. After a short while, the portrait was done. \"C'est maginifique!\" Vincent kissed his fingertips. The others came to see the portrait that he made for them. \"Ooh...\" Everyone awed as they saw how alive the portrait looked. Vincent smiled as he accepted their compliments and smiled to himself. He was an artist, this was like candy for his mental health.[Chapter 16] Later on, they soon had a party. \"This beats any party at the Grand Ballroom any old day.\" Eloise giggled as she danced with Ditto. \"You said it.\" Ditto smiled. Weenie appeared to be dancing like Snoopy which made the kids laugh. \"What?\" he then asked as he heard their laughter. \"Oh, nothing, please carry on.\" Darla giggled. Weenie shrugged and then continued to dance. \"Remember that Spelling Bee?\" Atticus smiled to Darla. \"Do I?\" Darla smiled back. \"Who could forget?\" Mo asked. \"I was so proud of you for being in the finals.\" Atticus smiled to Darla. \"Yes, the times with Charlie Brown and the gang sure were great.\" Darla agreed as those were simpler adventure times with a few exceptions. \"And what about the time he met the red-haired girl?\" Cherry asked. \"Oh, yeah, Heather...\" Darla smiled in remembrance before sighing. \"I cried so much when Snoopy ran away from home to be with that blonde girl at first.\" \"Yeah, but then as if fate had been planning her family was now living in a hotel.\" Atticus said. \"Yeah...\" Darla sighed. \"Ah, good times.\" The kids smiled to their parents as they reminisced some old adventures together. And where luckily, the cat family let Oliver stay with Jenny. \"You mean I can stay with Jenny?\" Oliver smiled. \"If that would make you happy, son, it would make me happy too.\" Thomas confirmed. \"Thanks, Dad.\" Oliver smiled as he nuzzled up to his father. Maisy decided to get back together with Tom. Thomas smiled back and nuzzled with Oliver which made the kitten purr. \"Tom, I'm so sorry about earlier...\" the white cat said to the gray tomcat. \"Why did you guys break-up again?\" Darla asked as she held Skipperdee in her hands. \"Yeah, why?\" Skipperdee asked. \"It's a very long story, I don't like to talk about it,\" Maisy replied after she made up with Tom. \"All that matters is that we're together again.\" \"Yeah.\" Tom nodded. The others looked curious, but they guessed they would just have to keep it to themselves. Darla barely remembered since she was a little girl at the time and had other things to worry about. The cat family then took a new picture together with Thomas and Oliver as the new members of their family, but of course, Oliver was going to go back to New York with Jenny once this was all over. \"You all ready?\" Mo asked the cat family. \"Yep, that should do it,\" Duchess smiled. \"Your children and their pets and Pokemon are very wonderful.\" \"We know.\" Atticus said. The kids smiled, proud of themselves as much as their parents were proud of them. The End ","Summary":" Oliver hummed by the window as Jenny was doing her homework about her family which made him think.

So… Don't sue J Dr. Evil's Story By Emily and Gina Dr. Evil was in his Evil Lair. He was sitting in his rotating chair when the phone rang. Dr. Evil got confused then he answered it, \"…Hello?\" He waited for someone to respond. \"Hello-o, …Ya know… when you call someone your supposed to talk… Yea.\" he said then he just waited for a few more seconds. Then a women in the phone said, \"…Hello sir…ma'am…, would you like to buy credit cards?\" Then Dr. Evil replied. \"Hmmm… no… not really… But… how much are they?\" \"Well sir/ma'am if you want to have one then you have to fill out a form then we'll decide what the cost is. But for now we need to know your name, phone number, and address,\" The girl said. \"Well I can't tell you that… And you actually should know my phone number and I have no clue of how you do…\" Dr. Evil replied. \"What's your name sir… ma'am,\" \"Oh my… stop calling me ma'am…\" Dr. Evil said. \"Then please tell me your name MA'AM,\" She said. \"How 'bout… No?\" Dr. Evil answered. \"You have to if you want to buy the credit cards Sir/Ma'am,\" \"Does it sound like I want to buy freaky deaky credit cards?\" Dr. Evil said. \"Yes,\" replied the girl. \"So what's your name sir/ma'am?\" \"What's YOUR name?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"There is no reason of giving you my name,\" she replied. \"Then why do you want mine?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"It's my job… sadly,\" \"O really… well sadly my job won't allow me to give out any of my information either,\" Just then Number 2 walked up. \"I'm filling out this form you asked me to do and for 'Name' do you want me to put 'Dr. Evil' or…\" Number two stopped when he saw Dr. Evil's face and him about to say something. Dr. Evil rolled his eyes, \"See what ya did Number 2...\" \"So your name's Dr. Evil, Sir/ma'am,\" The girl asked. \"…No… no…\" He said. \"Well Mr./Miss Evil-\" She started. \"Doktor Evil…\" \"So your name is Dr. Evil?\" Dr. Evil was silent \"…So?\" \"Well then give me your address and I'll send you the form for the cards,\" \"I'm am NOT giving you my freaky deaky address!\" \"You have to.\" \"No I don't… Why don't you give me YOUR address?\" \"Are you flirting with me sir?\" \"…Yes… I am flirting with you,\" Dr. Evil said kind of sarcastically. \"Well sir/ma'am I have to know your address for credit reasons.\" \"Why my address? We can just 'Hang Out' one day and give me the form then.\" \"Sir/Ma'am that wont be necessary. If you give me your address I'll send it to you and you wont have to deal with going anywhere.\" \"So you don't want to 'Hang Out'?\" \"No sir, I don't.\" \"Oh… Ok… well you know my name… what's yours?\" \"You have no need to know my name.\" \"You had no reason to know mine.\" \"Actually sir/ma'am I-\" The girl started. \"Shush! …No you didn't… now what about 'Hanging Out'? Or at least tell me your name!\" \"I don't think so Sir.\" \"Ok then… Bye-bye,\" \"Well if you must know it's Bartholomew.\" \"…Riiiiiight.\" \"I'll do some research sir and I'll send the form to you through the mail. Bye sir/ma'am.\" \"Wait! Don't leave!\" Dr. Evil replied. Then he heard a click which meant she hung up. \"NOOO!!! DARLING!!! COME BACK MY DARLING!\" Dr. Evil yelled through the whole room. Then Frau walked passed and heard him yelling. She stopped in front of the door. \"Doktor?!\" Dr. Evil dropped the phone. \"Frau?!\" Frau started walking away from the room. \"Frau wait!\" Dr. Evil said then got up and walked after her. \"Frau that was nothing!\" He said. \"O really? Then what were you saying? And to who?\" She asked. \"It was no one Frau!\" He said. \"I don't think so Doktor… I was listening to the whole thing,\" Frau said. \"… …It wasn't true!\" \"Oh yeah Herr Doktor, what ever you say,\" Frau said jokingly. Then she started to walk away. Dr. Evil started to follow her. \"O well… what do I care?\" He said and just stood there for a few seconds. \"FRAU!!!\" He yelled then he started going after her again. As soon as she was in sight she locked herself in the bathroom. \"Frau…\" \"What?\" \"I didn't do anything!\" \"I heard you, Doktor!\" \"Couldn't you tell I was kidding?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"No, cause you weren't\" \"…You can't prove that.\" \"I heard the whole thing.\" \"That has nothing to do with anything, Frau…\" \"It kind of does.\" \"Frau!!! It was nothing! I WAS KIDDING!\" There was a long silence. \"Frau! I didn't mean anything!\" Dr. Evil said. \"I know you did Doktor!\" \"Seriously Frau…\" \"I don't care Dr. Evil, go hang out with her.\" \"I don't really want to…\" \"I don't care what you do Doktor…\" \"…I think ya do if your locked in the bathroom,\" Dr. Evil said. There was another silence then Frau said madly, \"I'm going to flush your shorts down the toilet!\" \"…My shorts?\" Dr. Evil said confusingly. Then in the background there's a flush, \"I FLUSHED YOUR SHORTS DOWN THE TOILET!\" Frau said. Dr. Evil was confused, he leaned against the door to talk Frau into coming out. Then a few seconds later the bathroom door opened and Dr. Evil fell. He was laying on the floor and then he looked over at Frau. \"See… I flushed your shorts down the toilet,\" She said and held of a pair of shorts. \"Well… I don't even know if there yours but, that's beside the point,\" she said. Dr. Evil sat up then Frau walked out. Dr. Evil just sat there for a while then he stood up. He walked out, he turned the corner and Frau was just standing there. She said, \"Doktor, I think we need to solve our differences,\" Then she pulled out a big knife behind her. Dr. Evil stepped back. \"Ok… so not that way,\" she said and then set it down. Dr. Evil sighed, relieved. He went into another room. Then he saw her coming towards him with a chair. \"Well at least it's the only non-metal one here…\" he said. Then when she got to him he tried to get it away from him. \"Ok… calm down Frau…,\" he said then set the chair down. Frau just stood there. \"Frau, I think you're taking this to literally….\" Dr. Evil said. They stood there in a long silence. \"Ok then… what were you doing?\" she asked. \"Talking…\" \"About…\" \"About credit cards! Buying them!\" \"I don't think you were planning to buy them,\" \"You don't know that,\" \"You kept saying you didn't…\" \"Well I didn't…\" \"And why'd you keep asking her to 'Hang Out'?\" \"'Hanging Out' means nothing!\" Dr. Evil protested. \"Seemed like it did to you!\" \"Well… Uhh… I need to kill all… the good in the world… so if we did actually meet I would kill her!\" \"Really… you seem unsure about that,\" \"But I doubt we'd ever 'Hang Out', not that I really wanted to or anything…\" \"Oh ya Doktor…\" \"…ya…\" Again there was silence. \"Look I'm not like frickin Austin Powers who goes around with every girl he meets!\" Dr. Evil said. \"Well your related,\" \"So? I didn't want to do anything!\" \"Just 'Hang Out'?\" \"Yes Frau, just 'Hang Out'\" \"And what were you planning to do?\" \"…kill her? Keep her waiting there? …What do you want me to say Frau?\" \"The truth.\" \"That's the truth!\" \"…Your twitching Doktor… when you twitch your lying.\" Silence… Dr. Evil thinking of what to say and Frau waiting. About a minute later Frau gave up. \"Ok then Doktor… If you can't tell me then…\" \"Frau! I…I…\" Dr. Evil tried to say. Frau was just going to leave but then the music \"Complicated\" by Avril Lavigne start playing, and yes Dr. Evil was going to rap… Complicated Remix performed by: Dr. Evil Written by: Gina and Emily (~~ My friend and me) Chorus: Why you have to go and make things so complicated? I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated Life's like this you And you fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it into honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it. Frau: NO! NO! NO! Dr. Evil: When Frau came in when I was on the phone I never thought that this would make me all alone, I thought that I had found my one true love, I thought that this was my gift from above. But she misunderstood when I asked her to hang out, She got mad at me, and I don't know what about. Even though I follow her every where she goes, She thinks that I shouldn't be her beau. She called me a self-centered fake. But this is all just one big mistake. It happened so fast, I don't know how But she's gone, so it doesn't matter now. This is something that really do regret But I don't understand why she got so upset. Chorus Why you have to go and make things so complicated? I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated Life's like this you And you fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it into honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it.

What about all of the promises that you made me? What about all of the ice that you gave? What about all of the things you told me? What about, what about, what about us? Frau: I can't believe what you did to me, and it does, really make me see, That you can't be the one to trust, But then again, it was all just lust , I hate for it to end this way, But, of course, I can not stay, Sorry Doktor that's the way it has to be, Because you will never see, You just don't understand what I thought we had, But every time we talk, I end up getting mad, I'm leaving now, I hope you can see, What we could've been, and what we'll never be, What about all of the things that you say? What about all of the promises that you made? What about all of the ice that you gave? What about all of the things you told me? What about all of the things that you say? What about all of the promises that you made me? What about all of the ice that you gave? What about all of the things you told me? What about, what about, what about us? Scene switches to Frau and she's moving into an apartment. There's no extra rooms so she has to share a room with someone until they get another one. She walks into her temporary room and a man's in there sitting on his bed, watching TV. He has black hair and a mustache. He's wearing a red shirt with a black jacket over it and black pants. He looks over at her. \"Who are you?\" he asked quickly. \"I have to stay here until there's an extra room,\" she answered. \"No you don't, go away.\" \"I have to stay here… Burt…\" \"…How you know my name?! You some kind of stalker or something?\" he asked. \"They told me it at the desk.\" \"Sure they did.\" \"Listen, I'm gonna stay here for a day or two,\" Frau said sitting next to him. \"No your not. G-get away from me!\" Burt said sacredly. Just then Dr. Evil kicked the door open, and he fell over. He stood up and said, \"Frau!\" Then he noticed Burt, \"And who's that?\" \"It's-\" Frau started. \"I CAUGHT YOU CHEATING!\" Dr. Evil yelled. \"What?!\" Frau asked shocked. \"Your sitting on the same bed,\" Dr. Evil answered. Frau quickly stood up then said, \"Doktor, that doesn't mean anything!\" \"Yes it does!\" Dr. Evil said. \"Doktor, I just got here!\" \"You could be lying,\" \"Ya… but I'm not!\" Frau protested. \"Yeah… Uh-Huh,\"[Chapter 2] \"We didn't do anything,\" Frau said, then Burt replied, \"Yeah we did,\" Fraunglared at him then whipped him behind her back. \"OW!\" he yelled, \"What'dnyou do that for?\" \"So you did.\" Dr. Evil said. \"Yeah, we did,\" Burt said,nthen Frau whipped him again, \"OW!

You have to comenback! Just for the Evil organization!\" Dr. Evil said. \".Fine Doktor. I'llncome back just for the work,\" Frau said, not really wanting to go back. It was a couple days later and they all gathered to discuss Dr. Evil's newnplan. \"Ok. our new plan is to. wait. we did that already.,\" He sat therenthinking, then he opened his mouth to say something then stopped. \"No...nthat happened to.\" They were all getting impatient. \"Uh.

We go out and buyn\"aerosol spray cans\" and things like that. we spray them all as much as wencan, which will destroy the \"O-zone layer\" and cause it to melt the PolarnIce burgs and flood the earth!!!\" \"That's a good plan Dr. Evil, but uhhh.nwon't it a little hard to spray all of that?\" Number Two said. \"It's justnall of our plans practically combined!\" Frau said. \"Yes but everyone willnbe helping us, now. we have to have some with us.

She didn't answer back. \"Ok then. Number Two go out andnbuy a big supply of \"aerosol\" and other things that destroy the 'O-zonenlayer'\" Dr. Evil ordered. \"Ok Dr. Evil,\" Number Two agreed then he went outnto buy things. When he got back with a few bags of it everyone, except for Frau, Mustafa,nand Scott, went somewhere to spray them. While Scott was in his room, Fraunand Mustafa were sitting at the table on the opposite sides of each othernand Mustafa was towards the top of the table and Frau at the bottom. \"So.\"nFrau said. Mustafa looked up at her. \"Haven't seen you here in a while.\"nshe said. \"Uhh, yeah, I. had to be in the hospital. for a while,\" henanswered. Frau nodded. Then Dr. Evil came into the room, \"Your cheating! And we've been throughnthis Frau, your not supposed to cheat,\" he said. Frau and Mustafa lookednconfused then looked at each other, still confused. \"Don't try to hide itnFrau.\" Dr. Evil said.n\"Doktor, how could we have done anything in the half a minute you weren'tnhere?\" Frau asked. \"You can do a lot in a half a minute,\" Dr. Evilnanswered. \".Not much. and you told us to stay in here Doktor,\" Fraunreplied. \"Yeah, to prove your cheating,\" he replied. \"You're the one whoncheated!\" Frau answered. \"I didn't cheat Frau.\" \"Well I didn't cheat either!\" Mustafa just lookednback and forth as they argued. They continued arguing. \"Well then Doktor,nif you can't trust me then I'm leaving,\" Frau said. \"Come on Frau, not thisnagain,\" Dr. Evil said. Then Frau stood up, she walked towards the door,n\"Come on Mustafa,\" she said then she grabbed his wrist and walked out withnhim. \"See! I was right! Uh-huh!\" Dr. Evil said then walked out. Frau and Mustafa are walking down the road. \"Sorry I took you Mustafa, Injust wanted to make him mad and that was the first thing I thought of.\" shensaid. \"Yes. well.\" he started. \"But now we can't go back,\" Frau said. Itnwas quiet for a little bit then Frau said, \"I know. We can just tell NumbernTwo to tell Dr. Evil that he should let us come back.\" babbling to herself. So then they went to where Dr. Evil's underground lair was (under an oldnschool) and Number Two was outside spraying the cans. They got hisnattention and he walked over to them. Frau told him what to do and henagreed to it. He walked over to Dr. Evil and told him, \"Dr. Evil. Maybe you should letnFrau and Mustafa come back, just for the good of the organization.\" \"Well,nI never told them to leave.\" Dr. Evil answered. \"So. they can come back?\"nNumber 2 asked. \"Yeah, sure Number Two,\" \".Well Thank you Dr. Evil.\" Dr.nEvil looked kind of confused. \"I'll- I'll go get them,\" Number Two said. Number Two went and told them what he said. He brought them to the mainnchamber part of the lair and Dr. Evil was just walking into. \"So younbrought them back Number Two?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Yes Dr. Evil.\" he answered.nDr. Evil nodded like he didn't really care to much. \"Now, Mustafa invented a security lock in this place. So when I press thisnbutton all the doors will lock and we'll be trapped in here until I pressnthe button again, o. and for some reason all the doors lock except fornScott's room. Right Mustafa?\" Dr. Evil said. \"Yes, well we didn't reallynhave enough money to-\" Mustafa said then Dr. Evil cut him off, \"So if yountry to escape I can keep you in here, .let's try it shall we?\" Everyone just stood there then Number Two said, \"Uh. Go ahead Dr. Evil.\"nSo then Dr. Evil tested it and it worked. right, the doors closed andnlocked, but it override the power system and all the power shut down.n\"Well. Uhh.\" Dr. Evil tried pressing the button for them to unlock but theyncouldn't since the power went down. \".Ok Mustafa now what?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Well I guess the power has. gone out and I'll fix the wires and we'll getnout of here in a few. days.\" Mustafa said. \"Days?!\" Dr. Evil said. \".Maybenit won't be so bad Dr. Evil,\" Number Two said. \"There's no food in here.\"nFrau said. \"Or water,\" Number Two added. \"Mustafa! Get to work on-\" Dr.nEvil started, then there's a load thud, \"Ow!\" Then Scott came in, \"Dad! What happened?!\" \"Uhh, we had a little problemnScotty.\" Dr. Evil answered. \"Where are you?\" Scott asked him. \"On thenfloor.\" he answered. \"Why.\" \"I tripped over the chair. but I'm fine,\" Dr.nEvil answered then he got up. Scott sighed, \"So how much longer is it gonnanbe dark?\" \"Don't worry Scott. only for a few more. days,\" Frau answered.n\"Days?!\" Scott said then walked back into his room. \"Couldn't you of put a lock on his door too Mustafa?\" Dr. Evil asked.n\".Well I'll get to work now.\" Mustafa said. Then Mustafa walked off to thenother side of the room. Then about 3 minutes later Mustafa said, \".I-I havento go to the bathroom.\" \"Well. just hold it in for. about 5 days.\" Dr. Evilnsaid. \"So how can we go on without eating or drinking for a few days?\" Fraunasked. \"We can live like month without water Frau.\" Dr. Evil said. \"Wellnactually Dr. Evil, most people can't go more then a few days withoutnwater,\" Number Two said. \"You know everything don't you Number Two?\" Dr.nEvil said. Then about an hour passed. \"So. how you coming along Mustafa?\" Dr. Evilnasked. \"Uhh. Ok,\" he answered. Then a LONG silence. \"I found a flashlight!\"nFrau said, then turned it on lighting the room. She shown it around thenroom and Dr. Evil was watching the light carefully. Dr. Evil took the flashlight from her and shown it around while they allnjust stared at him. \"I'm gonna put a puppet show on for all you people.\"nDr. Evil said. They were all confused. He went behind the table and pullednout a few things, \"Here. take the flashlight\" he said giving it to him. Frau took it and shown the flashlight on Dr. Evil squinting. \"Ok now. letsnget started,\" Then Dr. Evil went below the table and he held up a Ken doll,n\"This is Dr.. Evan.,\" Then he held up a small plastic doll and said, \"Thisnis.. Fran,\" \"Doktor. where'd you get those dolls from?\" Frau asked. \"I-Indon't know... SHH!\" Dr. Evil said then he continued. For the guy he had hisnown pitched voice but more of an accent, and the girl he had a high Britishntype accent. Dr. Evan: *to Fran* Your cheating on me! Fran: Yes, I am. And I do a lot! Since I don't like you! Dr. Evan: I knew it! Who were the last people you cheated on? Fran: Uhh. B-Brian! And Umm. Mu.Mu. Mushoo! And I'd do it again! Dr. Evan: Yes I know you will! Fran: And now I'm going to marry a prince so I can be a princess and ridenin the parade! *scene switches to the girl doll riding on an stuffed elephant* Fran: Hello. what your name? Elephant: *a strong British accent* Ello! My name is Elle! Fran: Well Elle, I get to ride in the parade since I got married to anprince after mynhusband Dr. Evan died. Then Frau cut in, \"Where not married Doktor.\" Then Dr. Evil said innhis normal voice, \"This isn't about us Frau! It's about Dr. Evan and Fran!\"nThen he continued. Elle: Oh, How did he die? Fran: From an overdose of Cocaine! Elle: O that's to bad, why do you think that? Fran: I don't know, maybe he was stressed out so he got into that habit. Elle: What would he be stressed out about? Fran: Well I cheated on him on every guy I met. Elle: That's bad, you shouldn't do that. Fran: I know, but even if he was alive I'd still cheat! Elle: Well. the parade's over now, nice talking to you. Fran: You to Elle, Bye!n n \"The End,\" Dr. Evil finished. Everyone was silent \"Thank you,\" Fraunrolled her eyes, but since the flashlight wasn't pointing to her Dr. Evilncouldn't see her. \"I based that off of a real experience. yeah,\" Dr. Evilnadded. Then Dr. Evil took the flashlight. He went and sat down in his chair andnjust shined the flashlight around. \"Here let me see that,\" Frau said thenntook the flashlight from him. \"Hey!\" he yelled. She shined it at him, hentried to block out the light, \"Ok, give me it Frau.\" \"Why? I found it,\"nFrau said. \"Yes but it was in MY Evil lair,\" Dr. Evil said. Frau kept it and turned it off so the batteries wouldn't get wasted. Shenheard him walking towards her so she turned it on. She saw him walkingntowards her then when he realized the light was on him he stopped, \".Dangnit!\" Then he went and sat down. This happened three more times until hengave up.[Chapter 3] Then Frau turned it on and held it out then Dr. Evil practically jumped for it. He got it but when he hit it the light went out. \"Wait¼rn I can fix it¼rn\" He said. He was trying to get it to work then a couple minutes later, when it still wasn't fixed, Frau walked over to him, \"Just let me fix it!\" \"No¼rn I can get it¼rn\" Dr. Evil said. \"Come on just give it to me!\" \"NO!\" Then Dr. Evil still kept trying to fix it and he didn't for about a minute. \"Can I fix it yet?\" Frau asked. \"No! Hold on!\" Then Dr. Evil finally got it working, \"See, told ya I could fix it!\" He said proudly. Then Frau sat down in Dr. Evil's chair. \"¼rnGet out of my chair Frau¼rn\" Dr. Evil said. \"Ok¼rn\" Frau replied then stood up. Dr. Evil was going to sit on it then Frau moved it, then Dr. Evil missed. And he fell which you couldn't see because it was so dark. \"Ow¼rn ok.. That's the second frickin time I fell!\" Dr. Evil said. \"Don't do that Frau¼rn\" \"What¼rn what did I do?\" Frau said. Dr. Evil sighed. Right at the end of that conversation there was a noise coming from Dr. Evil. The noise sounded like a wrapper of some sort. \"¼rnWhat's that?\" Number Two wondered. \"¼rnNothing,\" Dr. Evil said with a mouthful of something. \"What are you eating?\" Frau asked. \"Nothing!\" Dr. Evil protested. \"I know your eating something!\" Frau said. He kept denying it for a while then finally gave in. \"Ok, fine¼rn It's just a freaky deaky granola bar!\" He said. \"And¼rn you ate it all?\" Frau asked. \"Yeah¼rn Well¼rn It's kinda late¼rn I'm going to go to sleep now¼rn\" Dr. Evil said changing the subject, then he went and sat down on a bed. \"¼rnHow'd that bed get in here?\" Number Two asked. Dr. Evil looked around, \"¼rnI dunno¼rn well goodnight!\" It was quiet, except for Mustafa who was working on the wires, then Frau started moving Dr. Evil's chair. \"Frau¼rn\" Dr. Evil said. Frau stopped then got it back to where it was. Dr. Evil sighed. She stood up, she started walking around and she ran into the bed, so Dr. Evil said, \"¼rnWhat are you doing?\" \"Well sorry I'm not used to a bed in the middle of this room,\" Frau replied. \"Well¼rn go away!\" Dr. Evil said. Then Frau went and sat down in his chair. After a while Dr. Evil finally fell asleep. He had a dream: (A.N.: This is an actual dream, scary I know.) Him and Frau were in a room. They were hugging¼rn oddly for them. Then they were holding hands. Frau's hands were dark and Dr. Evil's were really pale, and they had wedding rings on them. Then Frau put Dr. Evil's arm around her and they hugged again. Then Dr. Evil woke up. He looked around and realized where he was. His eyes got adjusted so he just saw figures of people. Everyone was awake. He just laid there and slowly sat up, then laid back down again. \"Are you awake Doktor?\" Frau asked, who was sitting in Dr. Evil's chair. \"Yes¼rn\" Dr. Evil replied. Then it was silent. \"I'm hungry¼rn\" Dr. Evil said. \"I think we all are Dr. Evil,\" Number Two said. \"¼rnYou don't know that,\" He replied. \"Well most people would be in a day!\" Frau said. Dr. Evil laid there. \"¼rnAre you even going to get up?\" Frau asked. \"No,\" he answered. Frau sighed. \"What Frau?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"You want me to get up? Huh? Well no.\" \"You've been sleeping for about 11 hours!\" \"You don't know that,\" \"Well around there\" \"Well, If I want to get up I need food\" \"We all need food!\" Then Dr. Evil laid there then all of a sudden he rolled off the bed, \"OW!\" he yelled and just laid on the ground. He was close to Mustafa's feet so Mustafa backed away. They all just stared at him for a second. \"So about how much longer Mustafa?\" Number Two asked. \"Uhh¼rn Well for this wire¼rn a day,\" he answered. \"And how many wires do you have?\" \"Something like 8,\" he said. \"And they each take a day?!\" \"No¼rn this is just a really hard wire,\" Mustafa replied. \"Well I'm sure it would be easier if someone would get out of the way,\" Frau said. No one seemed to figure out what she was talking about, well they didn't say anything. \"¼rnWhat?\" Dr. Evil said. Frau rolled her eyes. \"Can't you understand anything?\" Frau said. \"So you want me to move, right?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"You don't have to move Dr. Evil,\" Mustafa said. \"Yes¼rn that's good,\" Dr. Evil sad. \"¼rnYour going back to sleep?\" Frau asked. \"Yes, is something wrong with that?\" Dr. Evil said. She sighed. It was quite for a second then Frau all of a sudden started screaming, \"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SLEEP SO MUCH?!\" Everyone jumped. \"Wh-what?\" Dr. Evil asked a little sacredly. Frau sighed. \"NEVER MIND!\" \"No, what? Tell me Frau,\" Dr. Evil said. \"ALL YOU WANT TO DO, IS SLEEP AND EAT!\" Frau yelled. \"Is-is there a problem with that?\" Dr. Evil said, starting to sound scared. \"IT'S ALL YOU DO!!!\" She yelled. \"I didn't eat in a while¼rn\" Dr. Evil said. \"YOU ATE MOST OUT OF ALL OF US!\" Frau yelled causing Dr. Evil to move away from Mustafa. \"Frau I think you need to calm down,\" \"ME?! WHY?! NO!\" It was quiet for a little bit, \"Is this not a good time of the month for you?\" Dr. Evil asked. Frau glared at him, which he couldn't see since it was dark. So Dr. Evil said, \"Yeah¼rn ok. So can I sleep now?\" \"Ja, go ahead and sleep!\" Frau said loudly. Everyone was quiet for about 5 minutes them Dr. Evil said, \"Is anyone else hungry?\" \"I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SLEEP!?\" Frau yelled. \"I did¼rn\" \"IT WAS ONLY FIVE MINUTES!\" she yelled again. \"Well I always have to get exactly 12 hours of sleep, and I only had 11 hours and 55 minutes. So I had to sleep-\" Then Frau interrupted him, \"Well I guess so!\" she said. \"Uhh, right¼rn\" Dr. Evil said not wanting to say to much. \"So, now you want me to sleep?\" \"YOU WANTED TO SLEEP!\" \"Yes, I did, and¼rn I ¼rndid,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Then don't complain!!!\" Frau almost yelled. \"Ok¼rn don't yell any more Frau¼rn I'm getting up,\" Dr. Evil said worried and getting up while still holding his blanket around him. \"Good Job! Now try walking!\" Frau said mockingly. Dr. Evil took a step forward. Then Dr. Evil stumbled a little bit and couldn't go any farther because his blanket was stuck on the door. When he saw what was wrong he looked at Frau who seemed like she was glaring at him. He said, \"Great my blanket's stuck on the door!\" he went down and tried to get it off it, \"Frickin blanket!\" When he finally got it off he walked over to the other side of the room. \"Wow he walked!\" Frau said sarcastically. \"Don't do that Frau¼rn\" Dr. Evil said. A little bit later Dr. Evil said, \"There's has to be some food here¼rn Frau go ask Scott if he has any food.\" \"Why don't you!?\" she said. Dr. Evil sighed, \"Scott!\" He yelled weakly. \"What?\" He answered as the scene switches to Scott on his bed looking at a magazine with a flashlight, surrounded by food. \"Ya have any food?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"No!\" Scott said back. \"¼rnsomeone ask if he has any food,\" he said. She sighed but asked anyway for food, \"SCOTT!\" She yelled. \"What?!\" he asked. Frau went up to his door, \"Do you have any food?\" she said loudly. \"NO!\" he yelled. Then she opened his door even though it was locked. She some how got it open. \"Hey!\" Scott yelled, with all of his food hidden. \"I don't have any food! Well, not after dad stole my granola bar!\" Frau sighed then walked out. To be continued[Chapter 4] Note: The music in the move has a lot to do with this chapter¼ so just pretend the music in the music.. They really hear¼ \"No food¼\" She said. \"I bet he's lying,\" \"Most likely ya¼\" Dr. Evil said. Then music came blaring from Scott's room. \"¼Scott can ya turn that down!\" Dr. Evil yelled. \"No?\" Scott replied like Dr. Evil was stupid enough to ask. \"TURN IT DOWN!\" Frau yelled. Then the music stopped, then it started again. It was a CD and Scott was flipping through the songs let each of then play for a little bit. Then he stopped on the song \"Let's get it on\" by Marvin Gaye. \"What the heck is this?!\" Scott asked, yet didn't change it. Dr. Evil and Frau glanced there way. \"Scott, must you stop on that song?\" Dr. Evil said to himself. They all sat there in silence until Dr. Evil said, \"Scott, can't you change it?\" \"Why?\" Scott answered. \"Yeah, I like this song!\" Mustafa said. Then before Dr. Evil could argue the song ended. \"Happy? God¼\" Scott said. Scott went through the rest of the CD and not recognizing any of the songs. \"Where'd this CD come from anyway?\" \"That CD has all of my favorite songs on it¼\" Mustafa said. \"Well then it's probably yours!\" Scott said through his door. \"¼So that's where it went!\" he replied. It was quiet again then Mustafa started singing \"Let's get it on\". \"Mustafa¼ do you think you can shut up?!\" Dr. Evil yelled. \"YOU BOTH SHUT UP!!!\" Frau yelled, then Dr. Evil and Mustafa got scared and shut up. Then a little later Mustafa started humming it again. \"Must you sing that?!\" Dr. Evil asked. \"¼Sorry it's very catchy¼\" Mustafa said. \"Yes it is,\" he said. \"Why? Don't you like that?\" \"No Mustafa¼ I really don't¼\" \"Well¼ why not?\" Dr. Evil sighed. \"What's wrong with it? Does it bring back any bad memories or something?\" Mustafa asked. Dr. Evil and Frau both sighed. \"Oh ok¼ I'll try to stop¼\" he replied. \"This is all your fault Doktor!\" Frau said out of no where. \"¼What is Frau?\" Dr. Evil said. \"Well first of all, being here¼ and especially at this¼ point!\" she said. \"¼¼.What's second of all?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Huh? Oh¼. I don't use second of alls¼ they bug me,\" Frau answered. \"Riiiight¼ well it's not my fault your on-\" Dr. Evil started. \"No!\" Frau said angrily. Dr. Evil was confused then understood. \"Well it's not my fault Frau! And anyway like we said before it wasn't supposed to get weird! It kinda gone way past that, yeah¼\" Frau sighed, \"Well sorry! It's your fault¼\" she said. \"And hey! Don't blame being stuck here on me just because Mustafa made this...thing...\" Dr. Evil replied. \"You still pressed the button!\" Frau yelled back. \"Ya know Frau, I'm getting a little tired of your snippiness, okay?\" Dr. Evil said. \"Oh, your getting tired of it, ja? Well ya know what Doktor...I'm getting tired of you cheating all the time!\" Frau yelled back. \"Frau, I never cheated. You just assumed I was cheating. There is a difference.\" Dr. Evil argued. \"I know you cheated! I walked in and you were screaming 'No! Come back darling!' I think that's a reason to get a little suspicious.\" Frau said. \"I don't\" Frau looks at him confused for a few seconds and then says \"You mean to tell me, that if you walked into the room and heard my yelling 'No! Come back darling! Please Don't leave me!' into the phone, you wouldn't get even a little upset?\" Frau asked. \"Well, how loud we're you yelling?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"I don't know. Just answer the question!\" Frau yelled. \"Well, before I answer your question, I need to know how loud you were yelling.\" Dr. Evil insisted. \"Why?!\" Frau said getting frustrated. \"Because, if you weren't yelling loudly, then I would be upset. But if you were yelling really loud, like you usually do, then I would probably be running...\" Dr. Evil said. Frau looked confused yet upset at Dr. Evil. \"Fine. I was yelling not too loud. What would you do?\" Frau asked with her arms folded. \"Probably nothing, because unlike you, I understand the difference between cheating and just calling someone darling!\" Dr. Evil said. \"Well you said I was cheating when I wasn't!\" \"¼¼¼Why do think that I was 'cheating'?\" \"Well! I heard everything you said¼\" \"Like what? Huh Frau? Did u hear me say anything¼ make any signs of¼ noises?\" \"¼what?\" \"You know what I'm talking about, and since you heard the whole thing you should know\" \"Uhhh¼. Well who knows if you ever did anything some other time,\" \"It was a frickin telemarketer¼ and she kept calling me ma'am! I mean honestly\" They all just sat there in silence for a little bit then Dr. Evil said, \"Exactly!\" \"Ok, so now I have no¼ proof about that,\" Frau said. \"No, you don't,\" Dr. Evil replied. Then Number Two said, \"So¼ how's it going Mustafa?\" \"Oh.. Uhh¼ I might almost be done with the wire¼.\" Mustafa answered.[Chapter 5] The day went on mostly in silence. \"I-I have to go to the bathroom\"nMustafa said. \"Well that's to frickin bad Mustafa,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Inthink we all do, why don't we just go to sleep?\" Number Two suggested.nDr. Evil replied, \"You do that Number 2\" \"Yes I'm kind of tired myself,\"nMustafa said. \"Your not sleeping Mustafa!\" Frau said loudly. \"W-Why?\" henasked. \"You have to work on the frickin wire, that's why,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Well, I'm going to sleep now,\" Frau said a little later. \"And Letnme guess, you get the bed,\" \"Do YOU want the bed?\" \"Well why wouldn't InFrau?\" Dr. Evil asked. \".I don't know,\" she said. They argued a littlenbit but Frau won. \"Now Mustafa. You better get us out of here by tomorrow or I am goingnto liquidate you!\" Dr. Evil said. \"Yes Dr. Evil.\" Mustafa answered. \"AndnI'll just sleep on the floor!\" He said. \"Since SOMEONE'S taking up thenbed,\" A little later in the night there was a thud that woke everyone up.n\"Sorry!\" Mustafa said, \"I just fell over! But I'm ok,\" Then Dr. Evil saidnsleepily, \"Frau let me sleep on the bed,\" \"*sigh*, Fine.\" she said just asnsleepily and rolled off it to let him on. She rolled right next to him,nand before Dr. Evil could get up to get on the bed he fell asleep. *and that night Frau had a dream*(A/N and sadly I had thisndream myself.)nShe and Dr. Evil were walking on a path at night. It was dark (except fornthe full moon) so you only saw their dark figures. They were talking aboutnsomething, like them fighting. but they were working it out. Then theynturned to each other and kissed, but not a lust kiss.. More like a lovingntype one. (quite scary) Then she woke up. She found out she was laying right next to Dr.nEvil and his face was right up to hers (since he never got up to get in thenbed.) . It was a little surprising. so she yelled and woke everyone up.nWhich made Dr. Evil yelled since she was right there. \".What Frau?\" Dr.nEvil asked irritated. \"Uh.. I thought you were sleeping on the bed?\" shenanswered. \"Well I didn't make it, ok? .Why are you so close to me? Getnaway!\" He said. She realized how close she was and got up. They all sat there in silence for a while. \"Mustafa that better bendone,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Well actually.\" Mustafa answered. \"Ok Mustafa I'm going to kill you when we get out.\" Dr. Evil threatened. \"Yes. Well I REALLY have to go to the bathroom,\" \"Yes well I really don't care,\" \"I can't concentrate-\" \"I've got my own problems Mustafa,\" \"Well I probably can't get it done.\" \"Ok! Any one who cares has to get a bucket!\" And no one moved. After a little while Dr. Evil said,\" You know what. I'm hungry,\"n\"You had a granola bar.\" Frau said. \"That was five days ago Frau,\" Dr. Evil said. \"More like two.\" \"Ya know what Frau.\" \"...Wasn't there a coffee table in here? With coffee and food?\"nNumber Two said. \".Thanks for telling us now Number Two.\" \"Well.. We cannlook for it.\" Frau suggested. \"Yes... In the dark.\" Dr. Evil said like shenwas stupid. \"We can walk around and look for it,\" she said then startednwalking around. \"Yeah sure Frau,\" he said then stood up, took a few stepsnbackwards and tripped over something. \"Ow! I just tripped over a frickin metal thing!\" Dr. Evil said.n\"Where?\" Frau asked then headed toward where he was. She gently ran intonit. Dr. Evil stood up and picked up the first thing he felt on it. \"Nownwe get the food. when it's been five days without it,\" Dr. Evil said. ThennFrau picked up a pitcher filled with coffee. \"And I found the coffee!\"n\"Give me some Frau,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Ok... But give me a coffee cake,\"nFrau said. \"No! There mine!\" Dr. Evil argued. \"Ok then you don't get coffee!\" \"I demand you to give me the coffee!\" \"Then give me the cake!\" \"No!\" Dr. Evil said while eating some. \"Ok then!\" She said then drank some of the coffee. \"Give me some Frau\" he said getting closer to her. \"Give me some!\" she said getting close to him and trying to grab them awaynfrom him. \"Your so greedy Frau. you can give some to Number Two or Mustafa\" he saidnthen tried to get hers. They ran around chasing each other to get the coffee/coffee cakes.n\"Uhh.. Mustafa.. Didn't you make those coffee cakes?\" Number Two askednwhile watching then run around. \"Yes, why?\" Mustafa replied. \"Don't younmake them with alcohol?\" \"Yes,\" Mustafa said confusingly. Number Twonnodded. ___________________________________________________ Hmm. I suck at interesting endings. SO! What'd you think? Kinda odd Inknow. and more oddness to come! ~Jet[Chapter 6] Number Two nodded then said, \"Uh Dr. Evil don't you think we shouldnall have some?\" \"Why should I share Number Two? Your siding with Fraunaren't you!\" Dr. Evil said then he said to Frau, \"Are you cheading with himntoo??\" Frau sighed and said, \"No, But listen to him!\" \"Ooo look! I onlynhave a half lept!\" Dr. Evil said loosing his ability to talk. \".So give menit!\" She said. \"No!!!!!\" Dr. Evil said then he ate it. \"No! Doktor! You had to eat all of them?!? There was around ten ofnthem! You couldn't of ate them all!\" Frau said starting to get affectednby the caffeine. \"Well I did! And I would *mumbles*,\" Dr. Evil said.n\"..what?\" She asked. \"Give me it!\" He said going to her. \"I already dranknit all!\" She said. How did she drink the whole pitcher? Number Two thought. \"What??\"nDr. Evil said getting upset. \"Well YOU ate all of the cakes! And cakensounds good right now, but YOU ate it all!\" Frau said quickly. \"HA!\" Hensaid. Well that affected them fast. Number Two thought, \"Mustafa. exactlynhow much alcohol did you put in them?\" Number Two asked. \"About 3 cups.\"nMustafa answered. \"All together?\" Number asked. \"No. in a cake,\" he said.n \"...Why Mustafa?\" Number two asked. Mustafa shrugged. \"Well. we willnprobably have to leave sometime soon,\" said Number Two, leaving Mustafanconfused. \"Come on Frau.\" Dr. Evil said out of no where. \"What?\" She asked.n\"You know *mumbles*,\" \".What are you talking about?\" Frau said whilenconstantly moving from the caffeine. \"Give me the coffee!\" Dr. Evil said.n\"It's been gone! I drank it!!! You fool.\" She said while starting to walknaround the room. \"Hey! I was....\" Dr. Evil started. \"Thirsty??\" shenasked more perky. \"Yeah that's it! Hey. is there any more of them cakenthingys?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"No! You ate them all! Cause you ruinneverything!\" She said. \"Well I was um. uhhhhh. thirsty!\" \"Hungry\" Frau said right after he said thirsty. \"Hungry!\" He replied just as fast. \"Well I'm hungry too!\" She said then ran up to him, \"But YOU ateneverything!\" then she shoved him a little. \"Don't shove me! Or else Inkill!\" he said and shoved her back but toppled a little bit back wards. Mustafa kept concentrating on the wire and Number Two tried not tonpay any attention to them. But after a while he noticed some. things werenstarting to happen. \"Uh. Mustafa we should go somewhere else.\" Number Twonsuggested. Then Mustafa stared to figure out what Number Two meant. Number Two walked up to Scott's door and knocked. \"Scott?\" \"What?\"nScott said irritated. \"Uh, we need to come in,\" Number Two saidndesperately. \"No!\" Scott protested. \"Well Scott. your parents are.\"n\".what?\" Scott asked. \"Well I'll just say Dr. Evil's drunk.\" Number Twonexplained. \"What? How??\" Scott asked. \"Just let us in!\" Mustafa said.n\"*sigh* Fine,\" Scott said then let them in. In the morning Frau woke up early and tried to cover up whatnhappened. A little later Dr. Evil woke up. \"Ugh.\" \"Uh.. Good MorningnDoktor.\" Frau said. \"Hmm.\" \"How do you feel?\" she asked. \"Like my headsngoing to frickin explode!\" He said. \"O, well-\" she started but gotninterrupted by him throwing up. Great. and we don't have any water ornanything. Frau thought. For a while Dr. Evil was throwing up. Then Number Two came out of Scott's room, \"Ok it's safe,\" He saidnquietly to Mustafa. \"O. Hi Number Two.\" Frau said trying not to make eyencontact. Number Two and Mustafa looked over and saw Dr. Evil throwing up.n\"Uh... I'll just work on the wires.\" Mustafa said and walked over to them.nAnd Number Two stayed quiet in his little corner. After the long awkward silence Dr. Evil was finally able to get up.n\"Uh.. You ate to many of Mustafa's coffee cakes,\" Number Two said followednby Frau glaring at him. \"The ones with 3 cups of it in each one I'mnguessing.\" Dr. Evil said. \"Do you remember anything?\" Mustafa asked.n\"Now why would I remember anything?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Oh, well what happened was-\" Mustafa started but then Frau hurriednover and elbowed him. \"Ow! What was that for?? ...Well anyway you andnFrau-\" he said then Frau stopped him and whispered, \"Don't say anything!\"nBut Mustafa didn't hear her, \"Well you were-\" \"Well you did nothing thatndifferent.\" Frau said trying to stop Mustafa. \".What Mustafa?\" Dr. Evilnasked. \"You didn't do anything,\" Frau said. \"Well I think I should atnleast know what I did while I had no clue what I was doing,\" Dr. Evil said.n Then Frau just gave up. \"You and Frau were in the process of 'making a baby'\" Mustafa finallynsaid. \"I got it!\" Mustafa said as all the lights turned on and the doorsnunlocked. Dr. Evil stood there shocked as Frau was looking away from himnthen ran out of the room. ----------------------------------------------------------------- So. what do ya think? LoL AND! If I dun get to many more people tonreview. I might stop writing it. so. if u like it let me know! And I'llnkeep writing it just for you.[Chapter 7] Glad to know 2 people are still reading!!!! Thnx evil woman and dr. evilnfan! So. I'll keep writing just for you. LoLnThis chapter was typed by Gina ____________________________________________ After a brief silence, Dr. Evil said, \"Well, that was odd.\" \"Maybenyou should go and. talk to her, she is one of you're most worthyncolleagues.\" Number Two said. \"Why should I? It's not my \"thang\" to gonafter people and talk to them,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Well, can't you just givenit a try?\" Number Two asked. \"Fine, Number Two. But if she bites my headnoff, I'll kill you.\" Dr. Evil said his one last threat and went off to findnFrau. Dr. Evil turned a corner to see Frau sitting in a room by herself. Hentried not to make it seem too obvious that he came to talk, but he reallyncouldn't do much to hide it. \"What do you want?\" she said. \"What's yournproblem?\" he asked, unsympathetically. She sighed, and turned away. \"Heynlook, don't be mad at me. It's not my fault what you did.\" He said. \" What do you mean? It was just as much you're fault as it was mine!\" \"No it wasn't! I didn't know what I was doing!\" \"Well neither did I! And what was I suppose to do!?\" \".Not do it? \"Ja, easy for you to say!\" \"Well, you apparently need to learn how to control yourself!\" \"It wasn't my fault! I was hyper! What was I suppose to do!?\" \"Did you even think that I wouldn't figure it out?! I mean, seriously,nFrau!\" \"I don't think I thought that far ahead.\" \"Yeah, well, of course not. All you thought about was 'Me! Me! Me!' didn'tnyou?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Of course, at least YOU got something out of it, that's all that matters,nisn't it? I wake up with no recollection of what happened, and a hang-nover.\" There was a long silence, Frau trying to think of an excuse of whatnhappened, and Dr. Evil kept agreeing to himself that it was her fault. \"Well, I hope you learned you're lesson.\" Dr. Evil said as he got upnto walk out. But before she could say anything, he had walked out of thenroom. Number Two was sitting at a table with Mustafa, when Dr. Evil camenwalking back in. \"How did everything go?\" Number Two asked, delicately.n\"Oh, fine. I think she's learned her lesson now. Number Two, how are wendoing with the plans?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Just fine, Dr. Evil. The spacenshuttle should be completed in a few days.\" Number Two answered. \"Veryngood, Number Two.\" Dr. Evil answered. \"Thank you, Dr. Evil.\" He answered. A few minutes later, Frau came walking back in the main chamber andnsat down in her usual seat. \"Welcome back, Frau.\"nDr. Evil said, half mordantly. She sat there in silence and ignored him.n\"Riiiiiight.\" Dr. Evil said. \"Now since my plan to use aerosol and destroynthe 'o-zone layer' hasn't worked out as well as I planned... We must go tonthe moon and spray a giant aerosol can with everything bad in it we cannthink of. I figure it will be more affective on the moon, nonethelessnwe'll have more of it,\" he explained. \"Now do we have a rocket ready?\" Dr. Evil asked. Then Number Twonanswered, \"Yes Dr. Evil\" \"Ok, now everybody's going to the moon. Expectnfor Scott,\" Dr. Evil said. \"I don't want to go anyway,\" Scott said matter-nof-factly. \"I think Scott should have a babysitter. He's not responsiblenenough to be on his own\" Frau suggested. \"Uh, no?\" said Scott. \"Yes. wencan't have him be alone here in the lair,\" Dr. Evil said. \"I'm 19!\"nScott protested. (A/N I read in an Austin Powers book he was 19 inn1999... But.. Let's just say he is _) \"Someone get me a phone book,\" Dr. Evil said ignoring his son. \"Whatnare you gonna do? Just pick a name out of the phone book?\" Scott asked.n\"Precisely,\" Dr. Evil answered then pointed at a name, \"You babysitter willnbe. Old Lady Ludwig.\" _________________________________________________ It's a bit shorter chapter. but. you'll get more[Chapter 8] \"Come on dad!\" Scott said. \"Don't talk back to your father Scott!\"nDr. Evil told him. \"But Dad, I don't need a babysitter!\" Scott argued. \"Yes you do, I don't trust you,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Why??\" \"I don't need to answer you! I'm the head of this joint, and I command youngive me deference\" \"I'm not even going to be here half the time anyway\" \"That's what babysitters are for. To know what your doing when you'renhere\" Scott sighed. \"Don't sigh at me Scott.\" Dr. Evil said. \"No!\" Scottnprotested. \"Frau tell him to listen to me.\" Dr. Evil asked. Frau sighed.n\"Don't sigh at me! Everybody's sighing at me! Number Two and Mustafa. younget a raise since you didn't sigh at me,\" said Dr. Evil. \"Frau's pay isnthe only one that stays the same.\" Dr. Evil said. \"Oh, yours too Scott.nYou got nothing, and your still getting nothing\" \"They don't even do anything!\" Scott argued. \"Who?\" Dr. Evil asked.n\"Number Two and Mustafa! They just sit there and listen to your stupidnplans!\" Scott pointed out. \"That's enough from you Scott! Now go get menthe phone so I can call your babysitter,\" Dr. Evil told him. \"Ok\" Scottnsaid then left. They all waited there for five minutes until Frau said, \"Indon't think he's coming back.\" \".No? Fine then, Number Two bring me a phone,\" said Dr. Evil.nNumber Two went and brought him a phone. \"Thank You Number Two.\" Dr. Evilndialed the number, \"Hello. Old Lady Ludwig. I need you to come and baby-nsit my son, Scott. My organization is going to the moon and I don't trustnhim in my lair alone,\" \"I don't like kids, they bother me,\" Old LadynLudwig (O.L.L.) said through the phone. \"Yes well, he's 19,\" \"Oh, ok then. You sound familiar...\" O.L.L. said. \"..Yes.. Well we live in an old school's basement.\" \"Ok, I'll be there a few. . . Hours. . .\" \"Good\" Dr. Evil said then hung up. \"Well it's all set,\" Dr. Evilnsaid. \"Did you tell her she'd have to be here for a month?\" Frau asked.n\"No. . . I forgot.. .\" Dr. Evil said like he didn't care. Mustafa left to go fix up the ship while they were waiting for OldnLady Ludwig. An few hours later she came. The door bell rang. \"NumbernTwo, Answer that please,\" Dr. Evil said. The door bell rang again.n\"Answer it Number Two!!!\" \"Ok Dr. Evil,\" Number Two said then got up tonget it. Then the door bell rang again and Dr. Evil sighed frustrated.nNumber Two answered the door and O.L.L. came in, she was an older woman.n\"Hello,\" She said. \"Welcome.\" Dr. Evil welcomed. \"Thank you sir.ma'am.n.Sorry it's a habit,\" she said. \"You sound reeeeeeally freakishlynfamiliar...\" Dr. Evil said confusingly. \"Yes, so do you,\" said O.L.L. \".n. . Yes well, Scott isn't here now,\" Dr. Evil said, still confused. \"Ohnok. . . This place is very secretive,\" she said looking around. \"Yes we try,\" said Dr. Evil. \"Oh, by the way. What's your name?\" \"Dr. Evil\" Dr. Evil said then did the pinky thing. \"....Did you buy any of my credit cards?\" \".................Are you a telemarketer?\" \"Yes I am.\" \"And you sell credit cards....\" \"Yes.\" \"I think I know you. . .\" \"And I know you,\" \"No....I think you've tried to sell me some items before.\" \"Were you the one flirting with me sir? ...Ma'am?\" \"I wasn't flirting with you!!!\" Dr. Evil protested. \"Yes you were,\" \"No! I wasn't!\" \"Then what were you doing?\" \"Tell you that I don't want credit cards.\" \"You called me darling,\" \"......Did not!\" \"Ja, I heard you Herr Doktor,\" Frau interrupted. \"IT DOESN'T MEANnANYTHING!\" Dr. Evil said loudly. \"I'd liquidate you all if I didn't havena lot to do...\" \"You also wanted to know my name,\" O.L.L. or \"Bart\" added.n \"Well you wanted to know my name!\" Dr. Evil said. \"And you wanted to hangnout.\" \"Which means nothing,\" said Dr. Evil. \"But you were flirting with mensir,\" \"SHUT UP OR I'LL KILL YOU AND HIRE SOMEONE ELSE!\" Dr. Evil yelled. \"...Ja, that is true doktor.\" Frau said. \"Frau.......this has nothing to do with you!\" Dr. Evil said. \"Why not?\" \"Because I said so!! Your making this difficult for me!\" \"Well its all her fault this is all happening. . .\" \"Yes I know\" \"Then why are you making it seem like it's mine?\" \"You keep budding in!!\" Frau sighed. \"Oh by the way your going to have to stay here for anfew months...\" Dr. Evil said to Bart. \"Ok, as long as you have phone andnTV I'm fine,\" \"Yes. . .\" The Number Two came in. \"Dr. Evil, the ship isnready,\" \"Thank you Number Two . . .\" Dr. Evil replied. They all headed out into the chamber where the rocket ship was. Theynall got prepared to leave. \"Well goodbye sir/ma'am,\" Bart said. \"SIR! Nonma'am! Just sir. . . Do I look like a ma'am to you? . . .Do I???\" Dr. Evilnsaid. \"Were going to need someone to launch the ship Dr. Evil,\" Number Twonsaid changing the subject. \"The only way to launch it is from thenoutside,\" \"Fine...Bart!\" \"Oh I can do it. All I have to do is press thisnbutton?\" Bart asked, she pushed it and the rocket went flying away with nonone on it. ____________________________________________________nBart's a fool.

Thnx for the reviews guys! ^_^ and! I do have the story all plannednout! And it's pretty much all typed.. Just not the middle =Pn.Enjoy! LoL __________________________________________________________ Everyone watched the rocket fly away. Dr. Evil sighed angrily.n\"Number Two, how long will it take to build another rocket??\" Dr. Evilnasked. \"Well. . . With all the supplies we have about four months,\" saidnNumber Two. \"Great...well, little-miss-im-a-frickin-idiot-so-let-me-shoot-nthe-rocket-off-when-no-ones-inside, you can go far, far away for anothernmonth,\" Dr. Evil said trying not to get to mad. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you wanted me to push the button,\" said Bart. \"NO, I DID NOT WANT YOU TO PRESS THE FRICKIN BUTTON!\" \"Well you asked me to.\" \"I did not. You just said 'Oh let me!' like a little retarded child andnpressed the button that said launch REALLY big.\" \"Well sir you said my name.\" \"But I didn't tell you to press it at that moment!\" \"You could have been more specific sir/ma'am.\" \"Just go away. . . Far away for you own sake!\" \"I thought I was going to baby sit sir/ma'am?\" \"Do you want me to kill you or are you just incredibly stupid?\" \"When should I come back?\" \"In four frickin months!!!\" Dr. Evil yelled. Finally she left. \"Your actually making her take care of Scott?nStill?\" Frau said. \"Yes,\" Dr. Evil answered. \"Uh. . . Mustafa and I willngo work on the new ship,\" Number Two said. \"Yeah sure,\" Dr. Evil agreed,nthen they left. \". . . Why are you letting her???\" Frau started again. \"Because I don't trust Scott.\" \"Well can't you change the babysitter?\" \"It's to late, she's already hired.\" \"Fire her!\" \"Why are you so obsessed Frau?\" \"Fine, keep her! You want her to be here anyway.\" \"And what's that supposed to mean Frau?\" \"Nothing Doktor!\" They continued fighting for a while, mostly about Bart.. . Launchingnoff the rocket, having to care of Scott, etc. . . \"Never mind Frau! Can we just drop it??\" Dr. Evil continued a few minutesnlater. Frau sighed, \"Fine doktor! Since you don't care,\" \"How many times must I tell you not to sigh at me?\" \"Well sorry doktor.\" \"A few times is okay, but not every two seconds Frau.\" \"And it doesn't matter if you sigh a lot?\" \"Uhh, no, it doesn't.\" Then Frau just left our of no where. \"Fine! Leave, see if I care,\"nDr. Evil said a little loudly. Then Number Two walked in. \"What do younwant??\" said Dr. Evil. \"Uhh, sorry Dr. Evil. I can leave. . .\" Number Twonsaid. \"No, that's ok Number Two,\" Dr. Evil told him. So Number Twonstayed. \"Number Two I need advice,\" Dr. Evil said (odd I know). \"For what Dr. Evil?\" Number Two asked. \"Frau's being insolent again.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" \"What should I do.. .\" \"You can go and apologize.\" \"But. . . It wasn't. . . I. . . Fine!\" So Dr. Evil went to apologize. He knocked on the door to the roomnshe was in. He knocked again, and since no one answered he walked in. Hensaw Frau sitting on a guy, that was a henchman. . . And she had a whip. . .n(A/N: aha... It's in the Goldmember DVD. On the video in the deletednscenes there all singing \"What's it all about Austin?\" and Frau's therensitting on a guy.. It's that exact time. just so ya know if ya saw it). \"Frau! Oh........God...Frau!\" Dr. Evil said disgusted. \"Uhh...nDoktor??\" Frau said. \"God, I didn't even leave you alone for 5 minutes!\"nDr. Evil stated. \"Uhh. . . Wait. . .\" she started. \"I'm not waiting herenFrau..\" Said Dr. Evil. \"Umm.. Well, it's not.,\" she started. \"It's not what it looks like!\" \"Ok, then what is it Frau?\" \"Nothing!\" \"Nothing? Really?\" \"..ja..\" \"Ya know, I was going to apologize...for real...but...I see you're a littlentoo \"busy\" to care for that.\" \"Doktor! I'm sorry I'll.. .\" Then Dr. Evil left. For some reason he waited a little beforenheading back to the main chamber, like maybe she would get the point. Butnthen he heard \"stuff\" happen so he walked away. He got back in to the room where Number Two was. \"How did it go Dr.nEvil?\" Number Two asked. \"Not to good, no,\" Dr. Evil answered. \"Well what happened?\" \"She's in there doing 'stuff' with . . . That one henchman.\" \"Oh, sorry Dr. Evil.\" \"Yes well, It's ok Number Two. . . Actually it's not ok. . .no.. It's yournfault. You talk me to go in there. I'm psychologically scarred forneternity!!\" \"I just suggested you apologized....\" \"And I did. Which caused me to go in there and see. .. that.\" \"Well, what were you going to apologize about?\" Number Two asked. \"....Hmm.not sure..I'm not really good at this \"apologizing\" crap.\" \"But exactly why were you going to?\" \"I don't know..I guess I felt bad....and then there she was just.. and henwas.. just wrong..\" Then Frau came in \"I'm sorry Doktor!!!\" \"Where.. What... How longnwere you listening?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Well. . .I heard why you were goingnto apologize.. And besides I couldn't stay there. . . With him,\" she said.n\"Yes, I see,\" Dr. Evil said confusingly. \"So then I came here. . .\" \".. .Yes.. What was that guy's name? I must know who to fire.\" \"Uhh. . . Fire?\" \"He wasn't doing his work Frau! So what's his name?\" \"Uhh..\" \"Do you know his name Frau?\" \"Well...\" \"You didn't even know his name?!?!? Honestly Frau. . . You Germans...\" Just then the henchman walked in. \"Oh, your fired,\" Dr. Evil toldnhim. \"...What?\" He said confused. \"You weren't doing your work,\" said Dr.nEvil. Then he left without saying much. ____________________________________________________________________________n____________________________________________________________________________n________________ NEW CHAP! Ya like? Frau's. weird _ LoL REVIEW![Chapter 10] LoL last chapter not what you expected? Well wait till u read this.. And!nTo answer your love or lust question Dr. Evil fan. I've been wondering thatnfor a while now too. your not alone. ________________________________________________________ \"...I'm sorry Doktor,\" Frau said again. \"Well sorry doesn't erasenthe past Frau,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Uhh, I'll go work on the rocket now,\" saidnNumber Two, then he left. \"Well I hope your happy,\" Dr. Evil said. \"For what?\" \"I don't get it! I didn't even leave you alone for 5 minutes!\" \"Well I got upset.\" \"About what Frau?\" \"Oh, I don't know. . . Everything?\" \"Is that what you always do when your upset? Have you been using me as anstress reliever?!\" \"No! This was the only time.\" \"Yea, okay.\" \"What Doktor?\" \"Nothing. . .\" Then Frau just left. . . Again. \"Fine, go again, who know where yourngonna go next,\" Dr. Evil said then walked away too. Both a bit.. teary.n_ Four months passed very fast and the rocket ship was ready to benblasted off again. Bart was now there, to watch Scott and push the buttonnto launch the rocket. \"Should I push the button yet sir-\" Bart started butnDr. Evil interrupted her before she could say \"ma'am\". \"No, as you seenwere not in the space ship as of now. You have to wait until a littlenvoice says 'blast off'.\" \"Oh, Ok\" Bart agreed. \"Okay, do you understand?\"nDr. Evil said. \"Yes\" Bart answered. \"Ok, everybody load up!\" said Dr.nEvil. They loaded up and all got in the rocket. Then a computerized voicensaid, \"Talking off in 10. . .9. . .8. . .7. . .6. . .5. . .4. . .3. . .2. .n.3. . .1. . . Blast off.\" Then they blasted off. Then they were in there newly made moon base (fast wasn't it?).n\"Well, were in space, finally,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Ja. . .\" Frau answered.n\"Frau, you have to learn to put the past behind you. Seriously, it'sngetting annoying,\" Dr. Evil said, pretty much out of no where. \"What?\"nFrau asked confused. \"You seem upset,\" Dr. Evil said. \"I'm not. . .\" Fraunsaid still confused. \"Well it seemed like it,\" Dr. Evil replied. \"Ok...\" she said. \"Okay.\" \"But.... I'm sorry doktor\" \"For what?\" \"...That\" \"...What?\" \"...Nothing doktor\" \"Okay...\" \"...But I am\" \"For what?\" Frau sighed. \"Don't sigh at me!!!\" \"Cant you accumulate how annoying that is YET!!!??!\" \"...Sorry\" \"Then stop!! Good lord.\" \"Uhh.. doktor, why did u come into my room the other day...?\" \".....I was GOING to apologize\" \"...Really?\" \"Really\" \"But then..\" \"So you'll never forgive me,\" Frau said. \"Maybe. . . Maybe not. . . But still maybe...not.\" \"So Dr. Evil, why don't you mark a date on when they should pay thenmoney,\" Number Two interrupted. \"Because they won't pay me,\" Dr. Evilnsaid. \"Yes, and that's when you destroy the world,\" Number Two told himnlike it was the first time. \"Alrighty. When?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Wellntalk to them and give them a deadline. Like, a day or so,\" (Yes! Moonntravel became faster!) Number Two suggested. \"How about Today at 9:30,\" Dr. Evil said like it was the best idea.n\"But it's 9:15 Dr. Evil. Could they get it here that fast?\" Number Twonasked. \"There's always a flaw isn't there Number Two?\" said Dr. Evil. \"Well. . . You can always try,\" said Number Two. \"No Number Two, cause younwon't like it will you?\" Dr. Evil said sarcastically. \"JUST DO SOMETHING!\" Frau yelled. Everyone got scared since it wasna bit surprising. \"Calm down Frau,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Well nothing's goingnto work for you is it?!?! You try to get everything perfect but it's all sonSTUPID that it can't possibly work!!! So why even try? And if your goingnto then try it now before we get caught,\" Frau said impatiently . \"Frau, do you have your 'friend' again?\" he asked. \"Can't I be upset on my own??\" \"No, you can't Frau.\" \"So I can only be upset one certain days . . .\" \"We'll it would be nice. Then I'd know when to expect it.\" \"Hmm. . . Well you can just continue on your worst plan ever.\" \"Actually the one with the earmuffs were quite off.\" \"There all bad doktor... Now excuse me while I go throw up. . .\" Then she walked out of the room. \"I wonder what her problem is,\"nDr. Evil said. Then they heard her throwing up in the background. \"Flunmaybe?\" He questioned. \"It might be,\" Number Two answered. They all satnthere. \"Why don't you tell the World Organization about the deadline? Evennthough it's. . . 9:33,\" Number Two suggested. \"I thin I know,\" Mustafansaid bringing up the older subject. Dr. Evil ignored him and looked at thenclock. \"Great. . . We didn't even tell them yet. How about 9:45?\"nNumber Two nodded. \"Hello? If you listen to me I think I might be able tontell you something that you might want to---\" Mustafa started. \"Bring me the World Organization!\" Dr. Evil interrupted. When thenW.O. came up they sighed. \"What now Dr. Evil?\" \"Gentlemen! You havenapproximately 9 minutes for you to get me the money!\" Dr. Evil said, notnaware that he didn't even tell them how much money he wanted. \"What money?n And we can't get anything to the moon that quickly,\" the W.O. said. Dr.nEvil said and was about to say something, but Mustafa interrupted. \"Dr.nEvil, I think Frau's pregnant.\" ______________________________________________________________ Muwhahahaha[Chapter 11] HI!!! Sorry bout the long time to update. . . But everything in my computerngot deleted (and luckily I backed up my story the day before so I didn'tnloose that! But I did loose half of this chapter which I have to type allnover again) and been busy. . . I also lost all my notes on what to type fornthe story, which now I have to make up the story by memory so. . . It mightntake a while to get it all set up again. But! Enjoy this chap! And! Yes! You do start to show after the forth month but it's only earlyn4th. . . And I think you usually show kinda all of a sudden, but I wouldn'tnreally know _ and Dr. Evil never seems to notice stuff any way =P _________________________________________________________ \". . .what?\" Dr. Evil said. \"Morning sickness, after whatnhappened,\" Mustafa explained. \"But, wasn't she on. . .\" Dr. Evil started.n\"I suppose it's still possible. . .\"Number Two said. \"You can always asknher.\" \"Yea what am I supposed to do, just go up to her and say 'Frau arenyou-'. . .\" said. Dr. Evil. \"Well she would have to tell you eventually,\"nsaid Number Two. \"Well That's frickin great. . .\" Dr. Evil said. \"Yournstill on Dr. Evil,\" Mustafa said the Dr. Evil said, \"Oh, can I get back tonyou?\" And switched off with the organization. Then Frau walked back in andnsat down. \"So Frau how are you? Not that your bad or anything. . .\" Dr. Evilntried to say. Frau got confused then Dr. Evil said \"Number Two hasnsomething to ask you!\" Number Two got surprised. \". . .Well Mustafanthought. . .\" He started. \"Don't bring me into this!\" Mustafa said.n\"Well, Dr. Evil was just wondering. . . Oh I can't do this!\" said NumbernTwo. \"Great. . .\" Dr. Evil said. \"Well it's your fault!\" Mustafa said to Dr. Evil. \"What?\" Dr. Evilnasked. \"Nothing!\" Mustafa replied quickly. \"Are you saying it's my faultnFrau might be pregnant?? Huh?\" Dr. Evil said in defense. \"Uhh. . . Dr.nEvil?\" Mustafa tried to point out. \"What? . . .Oops\" Dr. Evil saidnrealizing what he said. \"Well Actually, I've been thinking the same thing.n. .\" Frau started. \"And. . .\" Dr. Evil asked. \"I think I am,\" she said. \"Because of who. . .?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Well-\" \"Cause there was Burt! And that one guy!\" \"There was no Burt! Just you!! And him. . .\" \"Well who there be any way to tell whose?\" Number Two asked.nEveryone stayed silent. \"Well I guess not. . . but we would have to figurenit out if someone was more. . . Careful,\" Dr. Evil said. They all kind ofnsat there not really knowing what to say. Then Number Two said, \"Well hownabout until then we get on with the plan.\" \"Yes... Change of subject,\" Dr.nEvil said, \"BRING ME THE WORLD ORGANIZATION! . . .Again!\" The W.O. came on. \"Gentlemen! I've made my decision,\" Dr. Evil said,nthen he threatened the world with a HUGE amount of money. \"We don't haventhat much money Dr. Evil,\" The W.O. said. \"Then make more, I don't care,\" Dr. Evil told them. \"Well-\" \"Or just get some from Bill Gates, I'm sure he has some he can spare.\" \"We can't just tell private homes to give up there money.\" \"Sure you can, you do it with taxes all the time.\" \"But-\" \"Fine, I'll talk to him then.\" \"BRING ME BILL GATES!\" Dr. Evil yelled and the screen magicallynswitched to Bill Gates. \". . .hello?\" He asked confused. \"Mr. Gates, Inneed you to give money to the World Organization or else I'll destroy thenworld,\" Dr. Evil told him. Bill just sat there in confusion for a secondnthen Dr. Evil said, \"Here talk to them, discuss.\" Then he switched over tonthe world organization and he was the screen was split between the W.O. andnBill Gates. \"See now I helped you when I'm supposed to kill you. So getnme the money in 15 minutes!\" Dr. Evil said and switched the screen off innthe middle of them telling him they couldn't possibly get it there on time. 15 minutes later they didn't have the money so they went out tondestroy the world. \"They should have at least gotten me the money afternall I did, but it's there loss,\" Dr. Evil said. He went up to the buttonnhe had to push to launch the aerosol spray and pushed it. They all satnthere waiting for something to happen. Then he pushed it again and nothingnhappened. Then he pushed over and over. \"Why isn't it working?\" Dr. Evilnasked. \"Maybe someone forgot to put the spray in it's right place?\"nNumber Two asked. \"Well go look for it Number Two!\" Dr. Evil ordered. Number Two went to get it and set it up, he came back and said,n\"Nothing's in the rocket Dr. Evil.\" \"And what are you saying Number Two?\"nDr. Evil asked. \"We must have forgot it on Earth,\" He answered. \"Great. . .\" \"We have to go down and get it, unless you want to just leave and forgetnthe plan.\" \"That spray was a lot of money Number Two, I'm not wasting it.\" \"Ok, so we have to go and get it.\" So they all got in the rocket, Mustafa in front flying and Number Twonin the front helping. So Dr. Evil and Frau were stuck in the back.nMustafa tried to start but it quickly died out, he kept trying and it nevernworked. \"It seems the engines out,\" Mustafa said. \"Great, How bad cannthis frickin day get???\" Dr. Evil said and Frau looked at him. . . Oddly.n\"What??\" He replied to the look. They all got out and Mustafa inspected the plane and started to trynto fix it. \"Well I hope this doesn't take long,\" Frau said. \"Well whonknow with Mustafa fixing everything,\" Dr. Evil said. \"I should really getnanother mechanic type person, after he ruined made the cryogenic freezernand made Mr. Bigglesworth's hair fall out, didn't make the wires right sonit locked us in, couldn't fix the wires after that, If that never happenednyou might not be. . . Yea, except if it's that one guys!\" Dr. Evil said. \"Doktor! It wasn't him!\" \"What? Why can't it be?\" \"Well I was suspecting it before I. . .\" \"So even though you had a clue that you were you still went with him.\" \"It was a small thought, I couldn't have known directly after.\" \"But still, why'd you do it Frau?\" \"I told you!\" \"But you had a clue. . . And that cannot be healthy.\" \"But Doktor I-\" \"No, were not completely sure because you had to do something to make itnquestioning. . . \"I'm pretty sure it's not his.\" \"Doesn't matter Frau. . .\" \"Doktor. . .\" \"Shh! It's your fault Frau. . . Now I must talk to the World Organizationnagain and extend there deadline because we might be here a while.\" Everyone grouped in the main chamber (except for Mustafa because henwas forbidden to leave until the rocket was fixed). \"And yet again, BRINGnME THE WORLD ORGANIZATION!\" Then the W.O. was brought to him. \"What now Dr. Evil?\" \"Gentlemen! I am giving you the chance to take longer to send me thenmoney!\" \"We don't believe your really going to destroy the world.\" \"And why is that?\" \"You never seem to.\" \"Well Austin Powers isn't here to save you now!\" \". . .Why?\" \". . .I don't know. . . Just thought I'd say that.\" Just then Frau ran up to him, \"I'M SORRY DOKTOR!!! I'm sorry forneverything! Accusing you for cheating! Attacking you with a chair andnflushing your shorts down the toilet! If they were yours. . . Moving innwith Burt! Leaving the Evil Organization for a few hours. Alwaysndisagreeing, running off with Mustafa to get away from you, making you hitnthe button of all of us to get trapped! Me in there while you werentrapped! Whatever you were trying to prove during that puppet show!nStealing the flashlight, taking your chair, making you sleep on the floor,nnot giving anyone else any coffee, yelling at you for sleeping to much,njust yelling at you for no reason, being so hyper I got pregnant, mightnchange your life because of it, trying to convince you to not hire Bart,nand making fun of your plans! Especially me being with the henchman andnyou having to see it!\" Frau was yelling, and pretty much crying now, shenwas kind of. . . leaning against him (if you want to call what I'm tryingnto explain that). The whole room was dead silent. \". . . Can I get back to you?\" Dr.nEvil said to the silent and confused World Organization. They nodded andnshut off. He looked down at her not really knowing what to say. \". . .Incan leave. . .\" Number Two said, then walked out. Dr. Evil watched himnleave then at Frau. He was VERY uncomfortable of how close she was. \". . .nRiiiiiiiiiiight. . .\" He said, not knowing what else to say. \"Is that all you have to say?\" She backed away and turned away from him. \"Well what am I suppose to say?\" Dr. Evil asked, still confused. \"You can accept my apology.\" \". . . . . . . . . Alright! Fine Frau!\" \"Well you don't have to answer like your forced to!\" Dr. Evil sighed, then said, \"Ok Frau. . .\" He said a little plainly,nwhich apparently was good enough for Frau. The next thing you knew the song \"You Sexy Thing (or \"I believe innMiracles\")\" by Hot Chocolate was playing. Take a guess at what'snhappening. Just a door is shown to the room that they're in. Then Fraunyells, \"GIFFORD!\" \". . .whose Gifford? Is that the henchman??\" Dr. Evilnasked. There was silence. \"So you did know his name, ok Frau, after thisnI'm not forgiving you any more,\" Dr. Evil said, Then they continued. ____________________________________________________________ .odd I know..

Actuallynmake it up!!! Writers Block -_-'n__________________________________________________________ Back down on earth Scott was just having a wonderful time with Bart.nHe's just slouching in a chair watching TV when Bart walked in. He mostlynignored her. \"Sit up,\" She told him. \"Why?\" He asked. \"Because slouchingnisn't good for you.\" Bart said then sat down. \"Your slouching,\" he said,nseeing how she sat. \"Well that's because I didn't used to,\" She saidntrying to sit up more. \"I'm leaving,\" Scott said getting up. \"Where are you going?\" Shenasked. \"To my room,\" He said as he was leaving. \"I better not catch you doing drugs again.\" \"Why?\" \"There not good for you.\" \"Well blame my dad for giving them to me.\" \"So your father gave them to you.\" \"Yea. . .\" Then Scott left. *5 Months Later* Mustafa was still trying to fix the ship so they were all still onnthe moon. Mustafa was getting some things and passed Frau's room to headnback to the rocket. She was sitting on her bed and finished with her firstnminor contraction. \"Uhh. . . Mustafa?\" She said. \"Huh?\" He replied. \"Inthink. . .\" She said. Mustafa was confused and didn't really figure itnout. Then Number Two walked by and saw the Frau looked. . . Different. \".n. .Frau?\" He asked. \"Are you. . .?\" Frau just nodded. \"Go get Dr. Evil, Mustafa,\" Number Two told him, then the stillnconfused Mustafa went off to get him. Then a little later they came in.n\"What do you want Mustafa?\" Dr. Evil asked then looked over and saw Frau.nHe just kind of stood there. \"Dr. Evil she's-\" Number Two started to tellnhim. \"I know Number Two,\" Dr. Evil said, a little afraid sounding.nMustafa looked confused, then a second later he understood. They all just stood for a while not knowing what to do. She startednhaving a minor contraction. Then they still stood and stared having nonclue what to do. And when it was over they did the same thing. In annhours time Mustafa went to go fix the ship and Dr. Evil and Number Two werenjust sitting there. All of a sudden they heard an explosion and alarms started going off.n Mustafa ran in, \"Uhh, Dr. Evil,\" He said. \"What did you do now Mustafa?\"nDr. Evil asked. \"Well. . .\" Mustafa hesitated. \"What happened Mustafa??\" \"Uhh. . . The thing is. . .\" \"What happened Mustafa???\" \"Well a small part of the rocket sort of. . . exploded,\" He finallynanswered. They were all pretty surprised and Dr. Evil and Number Two went to gonsee. There was a pretty large sized hole in the moon base's wall from thenexplosion. \"The air is leaking so we have to fix it quickly,\" Mustafa toldnthem. \"Well good job Mustafa. . .\" Dr. Evil said sarcastically. \"What isnthere to use to patch it?\" Number Two asked. No one really knew so they started looking around the moon base.nWell mostly Mustafa and Number Two. Dr. Evil just kinda watched and lookednaround while staying stationary. \"Just take out a useless wall ornsomething, use the wood,\" Dr. Evil suggested. \"And how do you suggest wentake it out Dr. Evil?\" Number Two asked. \"I don't care\" he answered. \"I'll go see if there's anything in the ship,\" Mustafa said afternabout 15 minutes of looking, then went to go see. When he came back henfound a few boards. \"Good job Mustafa. . .\" Dr Evil told him. \"Don't wenhave a storage room or something?\" He asked. \"I'll go see,\" Number Twonsaid then walked off. About an hour later they barely scraped up enough supplies and thingsnto cover up the hole. So with the tools Mustafa was using to fix the ship,nMustafa and Number Two starting to cover it. Since it was an hour laternFrau's contractions got a little sharper and closer together. They werenabout 10 minutes apart, and since there was pain involved Frau was kind ofnloud when they came up, because she's loud about everything. \"Honestly,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Do you think she can just a little bitnquieter. . .\" \"Well Dr. Evil, do you think you can help us?\" Number Twonasked. \"Why should I Number Two?\" He asked. \"Well you can help us, runnout of oxygen, or go in there with Frau,\" Number Two told him. \"Alright,\"nDr. Evil answered. \"I suppose I'll just sit here and run out of oxygen.\"n\"Dr. Evil. . .\" Number Two started to try to convince him to help. Dr.nEvil sighed, \"Fine Number Two!\" he said annoyed. Then went over there onnhis chair. Leaving Number Two and Mustafa surprised. It was taking them a while since they had limited supplies and had tonplan everything carefully, and trying to get around Dr. Evil who was mostlynjust getting in the way. The air was starting to get pretty thin. \"Whyndon't you go see how Frau's doing?\" Number Two suggested to Dr. Evil.n\"Hmm. . .\" Dr. Evil responded then went in her room. He walked in and saw her looking a little bored since there wasnnothing really to do in the room. She was just waiting and trying tonbreath well was all. \"Oh, Hi Doktor,\" she said when she saw him come in.n\"How are you doing Frau?\" He asked. \"Well I can't really breathe!\" shensaid, getting annoyed with it. \"That's Mustafa's fault Frau. . .\" Dr. Evilnpointed out. \"They fixing it?\" she asked. \"Yes, They're about half way done,\" he answered, short on breath himself. \"Only half? Tell them they better hurry up!\" \"Yes well, maybe turning the oxygen on would help.\" \"Ja, and have it all float out of the moon base.\" \"Yes. . . Well Bye Frau.\" As Dr. Evil left Frau started another contraction, almost deafeningnhim. And it wasn't even at it's strongest. \"How was she?\" Number Twonasked. \"Good,\" Dr. Evil answered with her yelling in the background. The rest of the time Dr. Evil just sat there and forgot about helpingnNumber Two and Mustafa. A couple hours later the air was really fading.n\"Can I please turn on the oxygen now??? It's almost done, it's not like itnwill all go away!\" Dr. Evil said weakly. \"Well, we don't want it to wastenfrom all going out of the hole,\" Mustafa said just as weakly. \"The thingnis ¾ done. . . It won't waste if we're breathing it. Someone's having anfrickin baby in here! Stop being insolent Mustafa, some people actuallynneed to breathe,\" Dr. Evil said. They didn't say anything and just keptnworking. \"I'm the boss around here! I order the things to do aroundnhere,\" Dr. Evil said, declaring he was going to turn on the oxygen. . .n.Well somehow declaring that. \"Wait, were out of supplies and there's still some space left,\"nMustafa noticed. \"Just use frickin clothes or something,\" Dr. Evil said,nmoving to turn the oxygen on while on his chair. \"Would that work?\" NumbernTwo asked. \"Better then a big open spot!\" Dr. Evil said and got the oxygennto turn on. \"I'll go check to see if we have any heavy clothes that mightnwork,\" Mustafa said. \"And I'll help you,\" Number Two volunteered. \"Dr.nEvil go see if Frau's okay,\" he told him. \"Why me again Number Two?\" Dr.nEvil asked then turned to see him , but Number Two already left. So henwent to see her for the first time in the couple hours. When he walked in she looked quite tired, mostly from the lack ofnoxygen. \"Hello Frau. . .\" He said when he walked in. \"Hello Doktor. . .\"nShe replied weakly. \"The oxygen finally got turned on,\" Dr. Evil said. \"Finally!\" \". . .So. . . How have you been doing?\" \"Well, I'm going to have a baby in how many hours, and I'm on the moon withnno air.\" \"Yes. . .\" He just stood there for a few more seconds. \". . .Bye Frau,\" He saidnthen started to walk out. He saw Number Two standing near by. \"Maybe younshould stay with her, she's getting closer,\" Number Two said prettynquietly. Dr. Evil tried to think of something to say to protest it thenngave up and said just as quietly, \"Fine Number Two!\" Then he went back innthere. He just sat on a chair that was in there. They sat there for a while.n They heard Number Two and Mustafa trying to fix things and the oxygen wasnslowly coming back. An hour went passed and they only started a few mininconversations, all starting with \"How are you?\". Frau was also starting tonhave more contractions every hour. It's been a few hours of just sitting there then Number Two came in,n\"The hole has been patched up, if the clothes idea worked,\" he said. \"GoodnJob, Number Two. It took you long enough,\" Dr. Evil told him, he was in anpretty bad mood from just sitting there, bored and uncomfortable. Then Frau started another contraction, which were now coming every 1nor 2 minutes. So it was pretty close, and this time you could definitelyntell she was in quite a lot of pain. \"Well don't blame me about any ofnthis, it was your fault,\" Dr. Evil told her for no reason what so ever.nShe just got in a VERY bad mood and felt the desire to practically kill.nBut Number Two spotted this out quickly. \"Uhh. . . Dr. Evil why don't younwait out here,\" he said and forced him out right after he said that. Frau just started to get really upset after that, about everythingnthat was happening and what happened before, like Dr. Evil not really doingnanything during her very painful contractions. So she started yellingnbecause of the pain and anger and swearing. . . A lot. Deafening everyonenon the moon. Finally after a while she calmed down a bit. Dr. Evil and Mustafa were sitting in the main chamber, just. . .nSitting there. Then Number Two came in and announced that they were born.nThey both sat there not knowing if they should get up or anything, butnfinally they did and slowly walked to her room. The first thing Dr. Evil saw when he walked in was Frau hold twonbabies that were wrapped in something. It was all VERY awkward at thatntime and quiet. Then Mustafa said, \"They're cute.\" \"Yes. . .\" Dr. Evilnanswered. \"So.what shall we name them?\" Frau asked all of a sudden. \"Wellnwhat. range. are we going in?\" Dr. Evil asked. Frau had a confused look onnher face. \"What type.style. gender.\" He asked. \"Ah! Well they are girls Doktor,\" \"Girls okay. Girls?!?!\" \"Anything wrong with girls?\" \"Uhhh.no I guess not.\" \"Good. So what are there names? You know Doktor, I always wanted my name tonbe Emily.\" \"Riiiiiiiiiiight. and which one is Emily? Hmm. Eney, meeny, miney, mo.\" Frau sighed. \"Ok.this ones Emily\" Dr. Evil said pointing to the one on the right. \"Now what about the other one?\" \"Well I picked Emily, Now its your turn,\" Frau said. \"Meno Geno!\" \".It's a girl Doktor,\" \"O yeah. I forgot. what about Gina?\" \"That's a good name,\" Frau agreed. \"Coo!\" Then a little after that Mustafa went to quickly work on the ship andnNumber Two had the babies to let Frau sleep. He was in the main chambernalong with Dr. Evil who were both really tired. \"Want one Dr. Evil?\"nNumber Two asked him. \"Not really Number Two,\" Dr. Evil answered. \"Here,\"nHe said and gave him one anyway. Then as soon as he did she startedncrying. \"Great. . .\" Dr. Evil said \"That one is Gina.\" \"And how do you know?\" \"Well just when I brought them out here I went through the trouble ofnmaking little bands to go around there ankles with there name on it.\" Dr. Evil looked at the ankle and saw it, \"Oh, I see.\" \". . .Number Two shut this thing up,\" Dr. Evil told Number Two.nNumber Two took her and she stopped crying. \"I'm going to sleep now,\" Dr.nEvil said then started walking away. Both the babies started crying, \"Wellncan you help? Just for a little bit,\" Number Two asked. Dr. Evil sighed,n\"Fine, to get the little things to shut up! And don't expect me to touchnthem Number Two\" They both stayed up practically half the night getting them to go tonsleep. They were crying a lot so Number Two made Dr. Evil hold Emily butnhe held her pretty far away from him. They all finally fell asleep in thenmain chamber, and somehow they fell asleep on top of the extra clothes thatnthey were planning on using to patch the hole in the wall. Dr. Evil andnNumber Two fell asleep quickly with Emily sleeping on Dr. Evil and Gina onnNumber Two. Morning was only two hours away, which was when the babies woke upnand started crying again. Dr. Evil and Number Two were in a deep sleep andndidn't wake up so quickly, but Frau just woke up then heard them crying.nShe got up and followed the crying, when she found them she smiled at thensite. She picked them up, off of Dr. Evil and Number Two who were slowlynawaking. Later that day Dr. Evil and Number Two woke up. Frau walked in andnsaw them up. \"Hello Frau. . .\" Number Two said sleepily. \"Tough Night?\"nshe asked. \"Yes,\" Dr. Evil answered. \"Ja, I see you didn't even havenenough energy to put them in any type of bed,\" she said. \"Yes well, it wasntiring, and. . . Where did they sleep?\" said Dr. Evil. \"I came in here andnthey were sleeping on you,\" Frau told them. \"Great, this frickin moon basenis not helping me be evil,\" Dr. Evil said. Then Mustafa came stumbling in. \"I fixed the ship,\" he saidnpractically dead because of how tired he was. \"It took you four months tontry to fix it, then it explodes and you fix it the next day,\" Dr. Evilnsaid. \"Well the explosion blew up half of the engine, which luckily wasnthe bad side, so I just rebuilt it quickly which took all night,\" Mustafanexplained. \"And you just so happened to have all the parts,\" Dr. Evil saidnand Mustafa nodded, then Dr. Evil did after him in agreement. \"Well your to tired to fly the ship now,\" Number Two said. \"No, Indrank a lot of coffee,\" Mustafa said, even though it didn't seem to make andifference. So they all went into the rocket prepared to go back to earth.n And finally took off. ____________________________________________________________________________n______ Long update @_@ hope you liked! ^_^ sorry it took so long = And don't mind anything like if I said something wrong about birth. ornbabies.. Cause I dun really know much. And the whole birth thing is spednup kinda, but only because I didn't want to keep saying they kept doingnthings for a long time, I wanted to get on with it! And most of the stuffnhere is for the sake of the story. But Better news. I'm pretty much done typing things, which means fasternupdates for you!!! Well review and the next chapter will come fast =PnSorry... I babbled _[Chapter 13] Yay!! Finally! An update!!! And all I had to do was to writ one more page :P which my friend, Gina, wrote So sorry about the delay.. and if this chapter seems different its because me and Gina wrote it 2 years ago.. So our writing styles different and our mind thought differently :P but were still juss as immature so dun worry, its not that strange[Chapter 14] Wow! I am slow.. I even have this all written out and still fail to update P Ok! I think it is going to end soon.. Cause I'm starting to do weird things with it.. And when the main plot starts to dwindle.. Yea and I dun want that to happen to this XD And! Me and Gina stopped being obsessed with Dr. Evil about 2+ years ago.. So.. We dun think of too many new ideas P but I still have more after this! So… enjoy! 15 Years later \"Why'd you do that! I HATE YOU!\" Emily screamed. \"…Go to your room,\" Frau told her. \"Why!\" Emily asked stubbornly. Frau tilted her head down and looked up at Emily. Emily sighed and walked to her room, she didn't really have anything else to do any way. Emily had light brown hair that was shoulder length. She was wearing dark jeans with a navy blue shirt that had an independent symbol on the back. Frau went and sat down on there couch. They had a bunch of animals running around since Emily brought home every animal she found. Frau had just got a letter from Number Two that they should come back, mostly for Gina. She had no clue how he got it to her. She wasn't sure if she wanted to go or not. After she thought about it she decided to go. She went and knocked on Emily's door. \"Go away!\" Emily yelled but Frau just walked in anyway. \"…Emily… I have something to tell you,\" she started. \"We are going to go see… your father and… twin sister…\" \"You said my father died you liar!\" Emily said with her arms crossed. \"I thought it would be best if I didn't tell you, but your father is alive. And you have a twin sister,\" She said. \"Lies! And I have a twin? You know you could've told me that when I went through the whole 'I wish I was a twin' thing,\" Emily said. \"Anyway were going to leave in 2 days to visit them,\" Frau said. \"Okay…\" replied Emily. \"But what about all my pets!\" Then Frau answered, \"Well, we won't be there long…\" \"But Who would take care of them!\" Emily asked. \"I don't know… we'll ask one of the neighbors!\" \"But-\" Emily started. \"We aren't going to be gone for a year!\" Frau said then she walked out. 2 days later \"Hmm… When are we going to leave?\" Emily asked. \"Soon,\" Frau answered. She seemed a little nervous. Finally they left. When they arrived the first person they saw was Number Two. \"Frau? Yes I heard you might be coming,\" he greeted. \"and this is Emily?\" \"Uhh… Hi…\" Emily said, she was kinda shy around people she didn't know. \"I'll go tell Dr. Evil you're here,\" Then Number Two went and told Dr. Evil. \"Dr. Evil… Frau and Emily are here.\" Dr. Evil jumped, \"What! Uhh… Oh yes… send them in!\" When Frau and Emily came in Dr. Evil went towards them. \"Hello Doktor…\" Frau said slightly nervous. They stared at each other for a second, then Dr. Evil finally said, \"Hi Frau… and you must be… Emily,\" \"Hey! Aren't you that dude.. that's Evil and trying to take over the world and went to jail a couple of times 'cause Austin Powers caught you?\" Emily asked. \"Yes, that's right…\" he answered. \"Emily… this is your father… Dr. Evil,\" Frau told her. \"…Coo!\" Emily replied. \"Number Two… go get Gina… and Scott…\" Dr. Evil said. \"Yes Dr. Evil,\" Number Two said then he walked into another room where Gina and Scott were playing X-Box. \"Gina, Dr. Evil wants to see you… and you too Scott,\" \"Ok…\" Gina said confused. \"Tell him to go away!\" Scott said. \"I think you might want to come out there,\" Number Two told them. \"Fine!\" Scott said then they followed Number Two to the room. \"Who are they?\" Gina asked Scott quietly. Scott's eyes got bigger, \"Dude, it's Frau!\" Scott said in his normal voice, \"I wondered where she went…\" \"Gina… this is your mother and twin sister,\" Dr. Evil announced. \"Twin sister? But she looks nothing like me!\" Well, Gina has dark brown hair that was either up or down (now its down) and she's wearing jeans and a yellow shirt with a black \"W\" on it. \"We must be fraternal… not identical…\" Emily said. \"How come ya never told me? I mean you could of told me when I was in the middle of that 'I wish I was a twin' thing…\" Gina said. \"Frau! Why'd you leave me with him!\" Scott asked. \"Well, Dr. Evil said he wouldn't help me with the kids, I tried to take them both but Dr. Evil took Gina before I jumped out of the plane! And why do you still live here anyway?\" Frau asked. \"I'm still training him to be evil\" Dr. Evil answered. \"…And you never explained why you left me here,\" Scott asked. Gina put her hand on her hip and glared at Dr. Evil and he made that \"What did I do?\" look. \"You just had to take me! And he kept his word about not helping! Number Two took care of me my whole life!\" Frau looked at Dr. Evil with a mad look on her face. \"What? I told you I couldn't handle it…\" Dr. Evil said. \"Then why did you take her?\" Frau asked. \"I tried to get them both so you would stay…\" Dr. Evil said. Frau looked like she felt bad after he said that. There was a long silence. \"Can we go play X-Box now?\" Scott asked. \"How 'bout NO, Scott?\" Dr. Evil replied. Scott rolled his eyes. \"So what have you been doing for the past 15 years?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Well not knowing you were alive, because SHE told he you were dead!\" Emily said glaring at Frau. Dr. Evil raised an eyebrow and said \"Oh really… why is that Frau?\" \"Well if I told her you were alive she would she would want to know things that I don't really know or can't explain to her…\" she explained unsurely. \"Right…So Emily… when did she tell you this?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"…My whole life…\" Emily answered. \"Well what did you tell Gina about me?\" Frau asked. \"Yeah! Like he talks to me!\" Gina said. \"Shush! You stay out of this!\" Dr. Evil said to Gina and Gina didn't really seem to care. \"I mean… I wondered about a lot of stuff… but it's not like he would help now would he?\" She said. \"And It's not like he even listens when I talk!\" Then Dr. Evil replied, \"I do sometimes! Like when Scott got his first girlfriend! …Ya…\" \"Oh really… and how is that?\" Frau asked. \"Well it was when Gina was about 4 or 5 years old…\" He started. Scott rolled his eyes. Flashback starts Dr. Evil is trying to hold the world ransom… again. \"…unless you pay me-\" Dr. Evil said until he got interrupted by 5 year old Gina. \"Daddy, Daddy!\" Gina said pulling on Dr. Evil's sleeve. Dr. Evil sighed and said, \"Not now daddy's working!\" Then he pushed her away. \"But Daddy!\" She kept yelling. Everyone at the W.O. looked confused. \"Fine! What do you want!\" Dr. Evil yelled. \"Scotty's biting some girls face!\" Gina yelled. Everyone at the W.O. started laughing. Dr. Evil looked confused at first then jumped up. \"…What's he doing?\" He asked. \"He's biting some girls face…\" Gina repeated. Dr. Evil nodded then said to the W.O., \"Heh… hold on a sec\". Dr. Evil followed Gina to where Scott and his girlfriend was. \"Hey Scott! Scott? Scotty!\" Dr. Evil yelled. Scott was clearly a little too busy. Dr. Evil waved his hands around them until Scott looked. \"What do you wa- Dad!\" Scott said as he jumped up. \"Who's your friend?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Look, can't you see I'm a little busy?\" Scott asked. \"No…\" Dr. Evil replied. Scott rolled his eyes then tried to leave but Dr. Evil was in the way. \"Leave me alone!\" Scott said then pushed him out of the way and Scott and his girlfriend went into another room. \"Well… Thank you Gina,\" Dr. Evil said then patted her on the head and he went back into the room to talk to the W.O. Flashback Ends \"See! I did listen!\" Dr. Evil said. Scott rolled his eyes. \"Yeah! Just once!\" Gina complained. \"I'm sure there were others!\" Dr. Evil protested. Gina glared at him. It was quite then all of a sudden a small rodent crossed the floor. Everyone just stared at it. \"Ok… What's that?\" Dr. Evil asked. Emily stood there, looked around and went after it. Frau sighed. Emily came back holding the rodent. \"Sorry…\" she said. Frau looked at her. \"What! I had to take one of them!\" Emily said, \"It's not my fault it got out!\" Everyone looked at her. \"Dude! It's a mouse!\" Gina said walking towards her. \"Isn't she cute!\" \"Awww!\" Gina said then she picked it up and walked away with it. \"Hmm…\" Emily said and just stood there. Gina walked up to Dr. Evil and held it out to him. He just looked at it, then it jumped on him. Dr. Evil grabbed the arm rests and pushed himself up a little. \"Oh Jeez… Can you get this frickin thing off me!\" Dr. Evil said. Everyone started laughing, and not really helping him. Finally Emily went and got it off him. But her mouse was usually frisky so it jumped out of her hands. It ran down to the other side of the room. Then it became face to face with Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Bigglesworth sniffed around it then Emily started going toward it. She picked it up quickly and cupped her hands around it so it couldn't get out. Mr. Bigglesworth looked up at her then Dr. Evil called him over. Mr. Bigglesworth ran over to Dr. Evil and jumped on his lap. Emily walked back over to were the people were. \"You have a cat? Cool! But if I would of known that I should've brought her cage…\" Emily said still holding on the mouse. \"…Yes…\" Dr. Evil said petting Mr. Bigglesworth. Again there was silence. \"Can I go? I'm supposed to meet Sweet Jay at the football game!\" Scott said. \"Fine go… see what I care!\" Dr. Evil said. \"Can we go!\" Gina asked. \"…sure…\" Dr. Evil answered. Scott walked off to another room as Gina Emily went into hers. \"There's a dance after the game… so you should dress for that…\" Gina told her. \"Ok.. What kind of dance?\" Emily asked. \"It's just one with music playing.. Nothing fancy,\" Gina replied. \"This is what I'm wearing…\" Gina said and she held up a pink and navy blue striped shirt with a white collar, and jeans that had strings going around it and hanging down in the middle. \"Ok…\" Emily said then started going through a little bag she brought with her, \"I'll wear this,\" Then she held up a navy blue and dark green that had navy blue half sleeves with the number '10' in the middle and 'brat' in the corner pretty small. The 10 and the brat were in white. She had dark jeans with a brownish colored belt with strings hanging down. They all finished getting ready and then they walked to the game. They mostly just walked around and talked about how Gina didn't like Dr. Evil and Emily didn't like Frau and they explained themselves a little bit. When the game was over they walked to the dance. When they got there, there was music playing really loud and it was very dark except for a few neon lights. They met up with Gina's friends Kacie, Ashley, Cori, and Nathan. Soon they all started dancing, except for Cori because she was too scared, and Nathan. Emily's style of dancing was a little different then everyone else's but pretty much the same. Kacie and Ashley were acting crazy, like usual, and Nathan was just standing there. Ashley has short maroon-ish dyed hair and she wore glasses. Kacie has blondish/brownish colored hair that was in a pony tail. Nathan had blond hair that looked like he did nothing with it. Cori has dyed blond hair that was just down. When they weren't dancing they were just sitting on the stage talking. \"So when did you get here?\" Ashley asked Emily. \"Like 30 min before the game…\" Emily answered. \"Cool…\" she replied. Then her, Kacie, and Nathan jumped off the stage and walked off somewhere. \"This is cool…\" Emily said. \"Yeah… there's a dance after all home football games,\" Gina said. Emily nodded. \"He's cute…\" she said. \"Who?\" Gina asked. Emily pointed to Nathan. \"OoOo…\" Gina said. \"I never heard that before…\" Gina said. Then Emily asked, \"Why?\" and she laughed a little bit. Gina shrugged. \"Look at him! Don't you think so?\" She asked. \"I dunno… I guess,\" Gina said then jumped off the stage. Then Emily did. They started dancing again then Ashley and Kacie slid across the floor to them. They didn't see Nathan for a while but then Emily saw him talking to a blond girl. Emily started walking towards him and the first thing she heard was him saying \"EWWW! You spit on my face!\" Then the girl laughed and she ran away. Then he went after her for revenge. \"Your insane Nathan!\" Emily yelled then she walked over toward Gina. \"What the heck? Where'd you go?\" she asked. \"Over towards Nathan,\" Emily answered. Gina laughed and said, \"Your insane…\" Then Emily said, \"Well don't worry… this won't turn into one of those 'love things'\" Then the screen switches over to Dr. Evil and Frau. \"So Herr Doktor… how did you handle with Gina?\" Frau asked. \"Well… she was a pain, ya.. annoying.. too loud…\" He answered. \"Oh really… Emily was very quite… well when she was younger,\" Frau answered. Dr. Evil nodded and said, \"Really…so what did you do when you left?\" As soon as she started talking Dr. Evil stopped listening. After a while when Frau stopped talking she saw Dr. Evil in a daze. \"…Doktor? Doktor?\" she said. Dr. Evil came back to reality. \"Huh? Oh! Yeah… fascinating…\" Frau sighed. Well.. Thur ya go.. If you are still reading this at all P Well please review:D[Chapter 15] Yes…nI did just update this story if the same minute P Backnat the dance Emily, Gina, Ashley, Kacie and Nathan were walkingnaround the school. \"I'm bored…\" Ashley said. \"Me two,\"nKacie said. \"ME THREE!\" Nathan said happily. Gina looked atnhim oddly, \"Your messed up…\" \"Wanna go back to the gym?\"nEmily asked. \"Sure…\" Ashley said then they all went back downnto where everyone was dancing. They danced a little bit more. \"Sonwhere'd you come from?\" Kacie asked. \"Australia,\" shenanswered. \"How?\" Gina asked. \"I dunno… I just know I wasnthere… I don't usually speak in the accent though,\" she said.n\"OoOo…,\" Ashley said. 5nmin Later Theynwere talking about Emily's animals and how she got them all. \"Hownmany do you have?\" Ashley asked. \"Uhhh… a lot… I bring homenlike everything I find…\" she answered. \"You have koala's?\"nGina asked. \"Yeah, two,\" she answered. \"Kangaroo!\" Kacienasked. \"Yeah I have one… I used to have a wallaby too but I hadnto set it free. I only had it for like 5 days,\" Emily said. \"Fraunlet you have a kangaroo and she gets mad when you bring a hamster?\"nGina said. Emily replied, \"Well… first of all she told me that wenhad to leave all my animals at home… and the rest is kinda long,\"n\"Tell us!\" Ashley said. \"Ok…\" then Emily started. Flashbacknstarts Emilynwalked into her house, at this time she was around 6 years old.n\"MOM!\" She yelled through the house. \"I HAVE ANOTHER PET!\"nThen Frau walked in. \"What now?\" she asked. \"A kangaroo…\"nEmily answered. \"And why do you want one?\" \"Cause there cute!\"nEmily answered. \"Well, you still can't have one,\" Frau said.n\"Why!\" Emily argued. \"Because there wild, Emily,\" she said.n\"SO! We can tame it! It's just a baby…\" Emily said. \"Thennwhat about it's family?\" She asked. \"There was none around! Andnit looks hurt!\" \"What did you do with it?\" \"It's outside…nSee! You can see it!\" Emily said pointing outside. Frau looked outnthe door and saw a baby kangaroo in a small field. \"Look at it!nIts so cute\" Emily said. Then all of a sudden the kangaroonstarted jumping around the yard, messing up all the flowers that werenon the side of the house, and then punching the side of the house.nEmily just looked at Frau and then Frau said\"Sorry, Emily, butnit has to go.\" \"No! That's not fair! Where's he going tongo\" Emily shouted. \"Emily, it's punching a whole in thenhouse! We just can't keep a wild animal in the yard\" Frau said.n\"We can train it..\" Emily said. \"I'm sure the older itngets it will get worse,\" Frau said. \"We can still train it!nIt's not that old! Besides, look how cute it is!\" Emily stillnargued. \"Leave it out there for a month… if it doesn't wandernoff or it's parents don't come for it you can have it. But younhave to keep it outside, and it has to be here in one month,\" Fraunsaid. \"But you can't tie it up or anything… or force it to staynhere!\" She said. \"Ok!\" Emily said, sure it would stay. Onenmonth later \"Mommy!nThe kangaroo came back!\" Emily said happily running over to Frau.nThe kangaroo left that day and didn't come back till exactly onenmonth later. Emily pulled Frau to the door and the kangaroo wasnsitting there. \"But it wasn't there for a whole month,\" Fraunsaid. \"You never said it had to be!\" Emily said. \"Yes, but itnDID wander off,\" Frau told her. \"But it came back! It missednme!\" Emily told her. \"Well you can't have it,\" Frau said thennwalked off somewhere. Emilynwalked outside to the kangaroo. She stood next to it then kneeledndown. She wasn't to close to it since she knew they could bendangerous. She reached out to pet it and it flinched then it gotncalm. \"I'll name you… Jordan!\" Emily said then she stood backnup. She ran back into the house and Jordan just stood there. For thennext few weeks Jordan hopped around the house and didn't go to farnaway from it. Everyday she saw it Emily would say \"Look Mom!nJordan's still out there!\" Frau sighed and tried to ignore it.nEvery time she left or went into the house she saw the kangaroonlooking at her. She just walked in and paid no attention to it. Thisnwent on for a few more months and Emily kept bugging her about it. \"Comenon! Give him one more chance! He's been here forever!\" Emilynwhined. \"It had its chance,\" Frau answered. \"Don't call himnan 'it'!\" Emily told her. \"Emily… listen, you have a lot ofnanimals. Why do you want another one?\" She asked. \"Cause it's ankangaroo! And It's so cute! And I want to have lots of things tonlove!\" Emily said looking up at Frau. \"You know, it won'tnhelp you if you keep bugging me about it,\" she said. \"Ok…\"nEmily said. Emilyndidn't say anything about it but she always looked outside at it.nEveryday after she took care of the rest of her animals. Then one daynFrau said, \"Emily, how about this. You can have the kangaroo… butnit can't come into the house, you can't interfere with any ofnit's instincts. For example feeding it or giving it any easier waynto live. And You can't bring it back if it decides to leave,\"nEmily's face lit up. \"Really! YAY! Thank you!\" Emily saidnthen she gave her a hug. Then she ran off somewhere. Flashbacknends \"So…ntechnically it's not really yours since you can't feed it or anynthing… and it can run away and you can't do anything to get itnback…\" Gina said. \"Well that was 7 years ago so those rulesnwere changed a little bit,\" Emily answered. \"Kangaroo! I want ankangaroo…\" Nathan said dreamily. Ashley hit him so he'd quitnacting retarded. Theyncontinued to go on with the dance. \"I wonder what my mom and…nyour… our.. Dad are doing on there first night alone…\" Emilynsaid to Gina. \"Well… who knows…\" Gina said. (oO) Finally thennight ended and everyone had to go home. after the dance, they werenwalking home. \"This town is really.. small..\" Emily said.n\"I know. It's not that bad though, cause you can know everyonenyou see in the halls..\" Gina answered. Theynwalked up to the door and opened it. \"EWWWWWW!\"nGina said with a disgusted look. \"Oh my gosh!\" Emily yellednat Frau who was… with… Dr. Evil. They looked away then quicklynleft the room. They went in through the other way and went intonGina's room. \"That was more then I ever wanted to see…\" Emilynsaid. \"Oh my Gosh, I know,\" Gina said. \"Well I guess I'mnstaying over here tonight…\" Emily said. \"Probably…\" Ginanreplied. Therenwas a long silence. \"So…\" Emily said. \"That's nasty…\"n\"Yeah…\" Gina said, \"I wonder what Scott's going to do…\"n\"We should warn him…\" Emily said plainly. \"No… that'snok,\" \"…Let's stop talking about it now…\" \"Good idea,\" Emilynand Gina continued there night and Scott never found out. When thenmorning came things were a little awkward. Gina and Emily tried notnto talk or look at Frau or Dr. Evil all day and they didn't reallyntry to look at them. They didn't talk much for a few days, whichnwas more then Emily expected to stay. Then she figured out they werengoing to move back in. \"Really!nCool! Are we going to go back and get our stuff… what about all mynanimals!\" Emily asked. \"Uhh… I dunno…\" Fraunanswered. \"Can they all come! Cause if they can't I'm movingnback…\" Emily said. \"I don't think all of them…\" Fraunsaid. \"Why! What would we do with them? Desert them!\" Emilynsaid. \"You can have the little ones… not the big. Like thentiger…\" she said. \"Why! She's trained!\" Emily said. \"Indon't think we can bring a tiger here,\" \"It'll stay outsidenif I tell it to!\" \"Yes, but in the winter it will be to cold,\"n\"This place is big! It can have its own room!\" Emily said. \"Indon't think that'll work… Now we'll figure everything outntomorrow,\" Frau told her then Emily got up and walked away. \"Whatnwas that about?\" Gina asked her. \"Just talking about if werengoing to take my animals. She said no to the big ones… but I'llnconvince her!\" Emily said. And,nof course, she did. In a week they were all moved in. \"Ok… now Inhave to deal with another kid and 5 million animals!\" Dr. Evilncomplained. \"Yes, and I'll help, and Emily always takes care ofnthem and doesn't need any help,\" Frau said. \"But how does shentake care of THEM ALL? There's a lot…\" Dr. Evil said. \"Indon't know,\" she said. \"Cool!nI've seen so many animals!\" Gina said. \"It's not thatnmany…\" Emily said. \"It kinda is!\" Gina replied. \"…I likenthe tiger…\" \"I know! Isn't it cute?\" Emily said. \"…Makenit attack my dad,\" Gina said. \"Ok! But then I'd have tongive it away..\" Emily said. \"Aww..\" Gina said. Dr.nEvil was mostly just standing there when Mr. Bigglesworth camenrunning up behind him. Dr. Evil was confused and then he picked himnup. \"What is it Mr. Bigglesworth?\" he said. Then he looked up andnsaw a big tiger running towards him. His eyes got bigger, \"Oh…nthat's probably what..\" He slowly started backing up. It stoppednin front of him and she started growling. \"Ok… nice kitty…\"nhe said then he started walking away. The tiger stayed there,ngrowling. And walked faster and then the tiger started going forwardntowards him. Then he started running and she ran after him. Henran into a separate room with the door open and Mustafa was in there.nThen Dr. Evil pushed him outside of the room and closed the door.nMustafa was confused then he saw the tiger. His eyes got bigger andnhe backed up as far as he could on the door. She looked like she wasngoing to jump but then Emily came, \"KELLY! No!\" Kelly tooknher eyes off Mustafa and looked at Emily. Emily walked towards hernthen took her by the collar. \"Sorry…\" she said then walked hernaway. Emilynlocked Kelly up in a room. When Emily walked out she saw Frau lookingnat her. She looked up at her then Emily said, \"What! I didn'tnget to her at first!\" \"Wouldn't you'd think you'd put thentiger away first?\" Frau asked her. \"I was getting to it! Then itnwasn't there so I went and got it!\" \"If it happens again thennyou're getting rid of it,\" Frau said then walked away. Emily letnout her breath then continued to get everything else situated. Dr.nEvil was again talking to the world organization. He was in thenmiddle of talking when a turtle walked out in front of him. It wasnjust passing by and Dr. Evil stopped what he was saying and looked atnit confusingly. Every one at the W.O. looked at it and got confused.nDr. Evil just stared at it for a few seconds moving slowly across thendesk then he pushed it off and said \"Freakin turtle!\". Henlooked back and the W.O. and smiled a little then got back to what henwas saying. Emilynmust of saw it because she walked over, picked up the turtle, andnwalked away while glaring at Dr. Evil. That left the W.O. a littlenconfused to see a girl walking passed glaring at Dr. Evil while henwas just talking. Thensummer soon ended and it was time for Gina and Emily to go back tonschool. \"Finally the little brats have to leave,\" Dr. Evil said. Sonthen they went to school. On the first day they found out that theynhad to try out an experiment with baby dolls. They got them from thenschool and they are the most real dolls that they can get. They getndifferent kinds and they'll all cry at different times and getnhungry at different times. It can cry in the middle of the night andnat any time. You have to treat it like its real or else it can die. Whennthey got it they got partners to help with it. Gina got paired upnwith a boy named Jeremy and Emily a boy named Greg. And Gina got anbaby boy named Matteo and Emily had a girl named Leanna. Whennthey got home Dr. Evil was confused. \"Don't ask… it's for anschool assignment…\" Emily said. \"Yeah… for some reason theynmade us take care of the realest doll they can have.'\" Ginanadded. \"And what do you mean by… realest?\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Itncan cry in the middle of the night… u have to feed it… you havento keep its head up…\" Emily said. \"Can't someone else takencare of it!\" Dr. Evil asked. \"Well we are paired up with people,nbut they probably won't help us…\" Gina said. ThennScott passed then he stopped. \"Ok good… there just dolls…\" Hensaid quietly. \"Scott did you have to do this!\" Gina asked Scottnquickly. \"What?\" he asked. \"Taking care of the dolls…\" Ginansaid. \"Uhh… probably… but my partner probably took care of itnthe whole time,\" He said then he left. \"Well… I'm leaving,\"nEmily said then here and Gina walked off. Onennight Gina was sleeping and the baby started crying. But Gina was anheavy sleeper so she didn't wake up and it kept crying. Butndifferent from Gina, Dr. Evil woke up from it. He got up and thought, I thought this was over with…. He went into Gina's room,npicked up something off the floor and threw it at her, and Ginandidn't wake up. He left and tried to sleep but the room was closento Gina's. Hengot up and when he picked up the doll to break it or somethingnEmily's doll started crying. \"Honest to-\" He started then hendropped Gina's doll. He looked down at it and said, \"…O well,\"nThen it started crying louder. He gave up and left. When he left henslammed the door and it woke Gina up. Then she heard it crying. Shenrolled out of her bed and then she was surprised when she landed nextnto it and it wasn't in the little bed. She picked her up andnrealized that her head wasn't being supported on the floor. Shenpicked it up and heard Emily's doll crying. Shenwalked into her room and saw Emily trying to get to the doll. Whennshe got up she kinda crawled over to it. She picked it up and laidndown. \"Hello…\" Emily said sleepily when she saw Gina. \"Hi,\"nGina said then there was a long science, except for the babiesncrying. \"…Someone broke Matteo!\" Gina said. \"Huh?\" Emilynsaid half asleep. \"See! His neck's been bent back!\" Gina said.n\"Hmm…\" Emily said falling back to sleep. \"Younknow… Dad probably did it! Maybe it was crying in the middle of thennight so he just dropped it! And I did hear a door slam… so I wokenup… I think it was him!\" \"Hmm… ok\" Emily said not reallynpaying attention. Emily got Leanna to stop crying while Gina wasntrying to stop Matteo. It was really quite for a while then Ginansaid, \"Ok… bye!\" Then she walked out. Thennext morning before school Gina walked up to Dr. Evil. \"Dad! Whatndid you do to Matteo!\" \"…Who?\" \"Thendoll!\" \"O…nyes… It wouldn't shut up…\" \"Younbroke it!\" \"Andnhow did I break it?\" \"Indon't know! But his head's bent back! His necks broken! I'mngonna get an F now!\" \"It'snnot like it my fault it can't keep its head up.\" \"It'sna doll!\" Therenwas silence for a little bit then Gina sighed and walked offnsomewhere. Thenna few days later it was Friday. When Emily and Gina got home fromnschool Gina ran up to Dr. Evil. \"DADDY DADDY! EMILY HAS AnCRUSH ON ONE OF YOUR COLLEGES!\" Then Emily ran up, \"Nuh-Uh!nYou do!\" \"Sondo you!\" \"So!nHe's better!\" \"NuhnUh!\" \"Ginanlikes Mustafa!\" Emily said to Dr. Evil. \"Wellnyou like Number Two!\" \"Wellnat least Number Two's not cheating with Frau!\" \"…what!\" Dr.nEvil had a very confused look on his face. Then Gina walked away. Dr.nEvil said, \"What-\" Then before he finished Emily walk away. Justnthen Mustafa walked up to him. \"Mustafa… what's going-\" Dr.nEvil started to say then Frau walked up. Dr. Evil looked at them bothnin silence. Then Mustafa said, \"Dr. Evil… I fixed your chair thatnyou wanted fixed,\" \"Yes… Thank You Mustafa,\" Dr. Evilnreplied. When Mustafa walked away Frau stayed there. \"…What is itnFrau?\" Dr. Evil asked her. \"Well Herr Doktor, I just over heardnGina and Emily yelling so I came to see why…\" She said. \"Oh…nok,\" Dr. Evil said. They both stayed there in silence. Then Fraunwalked away. AndnThus.. this is the last thing I have written.. But I will end it mindnu! mebbe next update……… but it WILL happen!

Honey, it's time to wake up.\" A familiar voice said sweetly. Victor Frankenstein groaned, clearly wanting to sleep some more. He turned over on his side, his hand hanging over the side of the bed. His eyes begrudgingly opened when he felt that same hand being licked. He knew that tongue all too well. \"Victor, wake up. Sparky's been waiting for you all morning.\" Susan Frankenstein told her son. Victor groaned again and stretched out his back, annoyed at his disturbed sleep. He opened his eyes and saw his mom standing over him with a smile on her face. Victor's loyal dog, Sparky, barked and hopped onto the bed right beside his best friend. Victor smiled and patted the terrier's head affectionately. \"Morning, boy. Morning, mom.\" He said. \"It's almost eleven, dear. I don't think I could let you sleep longer.\" Susan said. \"Eleven? Really?\" Victor asked before looking over at the clock above his dresser. He squinted at the numbers then looked back at him mom and uttered, \"Oh… What day is it again?\" \"Saturday. If you get up now, I'll make you a late breakfast.\" Susan kissed her son's forehead and got up off her son's bed. \"What'll it be? French toast or waffles today?\" \"Waffles, please.\" \"Coming right up. You should get dressed while waiting.\" When Susan exited the room to make her son breakfast, Victor sat up slowly stretching his back and arms and curling his toes, giving one final yawn. Sparky sat up eagerly, barking at Victor as he jumped around on the bed. \"I'm up, I'm up!\" Victor told the bull terrier before Sparky hopped off the bed. \"Take it easy, boy. Let me get dressed first.\"[Chapter 2] After breakfast, Victor went out to the backyard with Sparky. He was throwing a baseball around for the terrier to playfully chase and catch, but Victor couldn't help but feel a little solemn. Ever since his first day on the baseball team and Sparky's death, he didn't know what to think of the sport anymore. But here he was, throwing the ball around and letting his beloved dog happily catch it like nothing has changed. He still couldn't deny that this was his dog's favorite game since he was a puppy. If Sparky is able to even request playing fetch after the events that have just occurred, then Victor can comply. The sound of a door opening and closing could be heard close by and Sparky looked towards the small gap in the fence. He barked enthusiastically and ran towards the gate, wagging his tail in an excited manner; Victor stood up and followed his dog to the gate. The terrier put his face up to the hole as he continued wagging his tail, high-pitched barking came from the other side of the fence. Victor smiled and walked up to the fence; he reached up, grasped the top of the fence, and pulled himself over to see over the gate. He looked down and saw Elsa's black poodle Persephone sniffing at Sparky's head peeking through the fence; she barked happily at the terrier's presence. Victor looked up at Mayor Bergermeister's backyard and smirked; of course, the Mayor would have beautiful green, clean-cut grass with unscathed flowers and shrubs all around. Victor glanced over to his right and was surprised to find Elsa Van Helsing standing by the back door staring at Victor. Surprised, he let go of the fence and fell backward. \"Whoa! Oof!\" He cried as he landed on his backside, hitting the ground with a thud. \"Victor?\" He could hear her voice of concern and footsteps through the grass. \"Victor, are you okay?\" Elsa put her hands on the fence and looked over to find Victor. She saw Victor stand up quickly and pat the back of his pants with his hands. \"Huh? Oh! Yeah, yeah! I-I'm fine.\" He laughed nervously. \"Are you sure?\" She asked concerned. Victor walked over to the fence and pulled himself up and looked at Elsa peeking over. \"Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Why?\" Victor asked quickly, clearly embarrassed. \"Because I heard your voice, followed by a thud. I just wanted to make sure you were okay.\" \"Oh, well… I'm fine.\" \"Good… Why were you peeking over the fence anyway?\" She asked. \"Oh-I uh-well Sparky, he uh-he was just looking through the hole in the fence and I wanted to see what he was…\" Victor looked into Elsa's eyes and trailed off. \"…looking at…\" Elsa looked over at Persephone sitting in front of Sparky, their noses touching; she smiled softly and tilted her head. Victor had saved Persephone and saved herself that Friday night… and she never officially thanked him for it. Elsa turned back at Victor suddenly; he pulled his head back at her sudden action, startled again. \"Whoa!\" Victor exclaimed. \"Oh, sorry.\" Elsa said. \"No, it's okay.\" Victor replied, calming down. \"Victor? You know… I never got to thank you and Sparky.\" Elsa blushed, looking away and back at Victor. \"For what?\" He wasn't focusing, increasing Elsa's embarrassment. \"For saving me and Persephone from that mutant rat and that vampire-cat thing… and from plummeting to our death off of a burning windmill on Dutch Day.\" \"Oh that…\" Victor blushed. \"You were in trouble and I was worried…\" Victor stopped mid-sentence, \"It was nothing.\" He looked down, a blush forming on his cheeks. \"You saved our lives that night, TWICE. That was very brave of you, Victor.\" Elsa cooed. \"I-I didn't want you to get hurt.\" Victor smiled bashfully. \"Thank you.\" Elsa said softly. The two of them looked at the other with interest for what felt like forever but was only a few seconds. Victor's arms began to shake under his weight and suddenly he fell back onto his feet. He saw Elsa pull away from his view. \"Um… Elsa?\" Victor called her name and pulled himself up over the fence once again. \"Yeah?\" She turned and looked up at him. \"I was wondering… I mean if you'd like to, would you… like to walk to school with me on Monday?\" He asked nervously, ignoring the shakiness in his arms. Elsa's eyes widened before she smiled back at Victor, shyly rubbing her forearm. \"…Yeah, I'd like that.\" She replied. \"Really?\" \"Of course.\" \"Great! I-I mean… cool.\" Victor smiled and fell back again and landed on the grass once again. Sparky pulled his head out of the fence and turned to look at his master. He barked and ran up to him. Victor sat up slowly, rubbing the back of his head. Sparky ran up to him and began licking his face. \"You okay?\" Elsa called out once again. Victor faked a smile as the girl peeked over the fence. \"Yeah.\" He groaned, still rubbing his head. \"Just fine.\" Elsa chuckled and pulled away. \"I'll see you later.\" \"See ya…\" Sparky looked over at the whole in the fence and watched Persephone disappear from his sight before looking back at Victor and licking his face once again. However, Victor was undeterred by his dog's actions; he just kept looking at the fence in a daze. \"Just fine…\" He said to himself.[Chapter 3] The weekend seemed to fly by and Monday had come faster than you can say 'take a note'. Today is the first day back to school since the Dutch Day disaster last Friday night. Mr. Rzykruski wouldn't be teaching the class anymore so the class will be forced to listen to the gym teacher teach a class she obviously has no interest in, or at least until the original teacher returns, but no one knows when that will be. But maybe today won't be so bad, Victor figured, he was going to walk to school with Elsa today. Victor smiled to himself at the thought before standing up from his seat at the table. Victor grabbed his plate and put it into the sink for his mom to wash. Victor walked down the hallway and turned into his room to grab his school bag then walked back into the kitchen, swinging the strap over his shoulder. Sparky rushed to his owner's feet and began to jump around him. \"Bye Mom, I'm off the school.\" Victor announced as he bent down to pet his dog. \"You're leaving already?\" She asked as she reached for the dishes in the sink. \"It's not even 7:30.\" \"I know. I'm walking to school with Elsa today.\" Victor told her, avoiding contact with his parents and focusing on his dog. Susan and Edward exchanged prideful glances. \"Really?! That's great, son!\" Edward called out, turning around to face his son. \"She's such a pretty girl and seems very sweet.\" Susan added. Victor blushed and said nothing. \"Is this going to be an everyday thing?\" Edward asked his son, putting down the newspaper he was reading and looking at his son who was petting Sparky. Victor looked up at his dad briefly. \"I don't know.\" He mumbled, bashfully shrugging his shoulders. \"Do you like her?\" His mother asked. Victor got embarrassed rather quickly. \"Yeah, she's nice.\" Victor continued to mumble. \"I think you should hang out with her more. You know, there comes a time when a young man such as yourself becomes more interested in girls—\" \"Dad!\" Victor shouted as his face turned bright red. \"You should invite her over for dinner sometime, sweetie.\" Susan chimed. \"Mom, stop!\" Victor yelled at his mother, covering his eyes in embarrassment. \"You picked a good girl, son. Now is the time to reel her in.\" Edward told his son, reeling the handle on the invisible fishing pole. \"Okay! That's it, I'm outta here!\" Victor called, raising his hand over his head in exasperation before he stomped to the front door. Sparky barked a goodbye to Victor. \"Have a good day at school, Victor!\" His mother shouted. The door slammed shut and Susan looked over at her husband. \"Well… at least he's making friends.\" She smiled. \"And a girlfriend, too.\" Edward smiled and pulled the newspaper back in front of his face. Susan smiled and shook her head playfully. Victor huffed and puffed as he walked briskly to his neighbor's house. He stood at the front door and rang the door bell, still fuming from embarrassment. Victor's eyes popped open when the door opened to reveal Mayor Bergermeister. Victor suddenly became timid, surely Victor was the last person the Mayor wanted to see right now. \"Good morning, Mr. Bergermeister.\" Victor smiled nervously. \"Is um, is uh… is Elsa still here?\" The Mayor glared down at the boy through his thick glasses. The silence grew thick and unpleasant, so thick you can almost cut it with a knife; Victor looked away, trying to escape the gaze of his rather nasty neighbor. Suddenly the Mayor leaned down the eleven year old boy's level. Victor pulled his head down and looked up at the frightening man with wide eyes. \"You may have saved my niece and that dog of hers, but that's no excuse for ruining the most important day of my career.\" He scolded. \"Sir, I didn't mean for—\" \"Uncle Bob!\" Elsa called out with her soulful voice. \"Leave him alone.\" Elsa pushed between the doorframe and her uncle to get outside. \"His deceased dog terrorized the town with a band of undead mutant creatures and ruined Dutch Day!\" He pointed a finger at Victor. \"Would you just get over it already?! Victor saved me and Persephone that night.\" She stood in front of Victor to defend him from her uncle, who Victor was obviously intimidated by. \"Or is that not important?\" The Mayor inhaled deeply and puffed the air out his nose, pulling his hands onto his hips. He shouldn't stay mad at the boy; he had saved his niece from falling to her death off the windmill he accidently set on fire. \"Where is that dog?\" He demanded. Elsa sighed; she knew that there was no compromising or negotiating with her uncle about Persephone. He clearly hated her dog… or any animal for that matter. \"She's in my room.\" Elsa sighed. \"Good.\" The Mayor exclaimed. Elsa looked over at Victor, she noticed his discomfort. \"We need to get to school.\" Elsa said to her uncle. \"Well, what are you waiting for? Get going. I'll see you later.\" He demanded, pulling back inside and closing the door in their faces. There was a short pause. Elsa sighed in frustration and rolled her eyes before turning around and walking down the lawn to the sidewalk. Victor looked between the shut door and back at Elsa, he ran to catch up with her down the sidewalk. \"Hey, Elsa!\" He called as he walked up beside her. \"Why is your dog locked up in your room?\" The two walked at the same pace. Elsa sighed once again in frustration. \"My uncle has never really been fond of animals. He doesn't want Persephone to ruin his precious flowers. She doesn't even go near them.\" \"Geez, that's awful.\" Victor said sadly. \"I know, I hate having to leave her in there while I'm at school.\" Elsa looked over at Victor; he did seem to sympathize with her. \"Besides, whenever she's outside she's always trying to flirt with Sparky through the fence.\" Elsa looked at Victor and smiled softly, anticipating his reaction. Victor laughed briefly at the romance between their dogs. \"Hey! Why don't you take Persephone over to my house while we're at school?\" Victor asked her. \"What? Oh, Victor, I don't know. Wouldn't your parents get irritated with two dogs running around the house?\" Elsa asked. \"Of course not! They wouldn't bother either of them.\" Victor reasoned. \"Persephone wouldn't be confined to one room and I'm sure she'd love to play with Sparky all day. I'm sure he gets bored while I'm at school too.\" \"Well… as long as it's okay with your parents.\" Elsa smiled. \"But… maybe you shouldn't come over to my house anymore.\" \"What?\" Victor asked, slightly taken back by her comment. \"I don't want you to have to worry about my uncle anymore. I'll bring Persephone over and then we can walk to school, okay?\" Elsa asked nervously. \"Oh. Okay…\" Victor thought back to his embarrassing morning with his mom and dad. \"But you'd have to deal with my parents.\" \"Come on, they can't be that bad. They seem so nice.\" \"No, they are nice and very supportive but they can be a little… embarrassing.\" \"What parents aren't?\" Elsa asked. \"My parents embarrass me all the time.\" Silence fell onto the couple as they continued to walk, now halfway to their destination. Elsa hadn't always lived next door, Victor thought. \"Where are your parents? If you don't mind me asking. I mean, you haven't always lived next door to me.\" Victor felt like he was imposing on Elsa's personal space and problems. When she didn't respond he began to panic. \"You don't have to tell me.\" He said quickly. \"No, it's fine. I just miss them, that's all. They had to go meet some Count or Duke or whatever in Romania. They said they'd be home for Thanksgiving. I hope they will be.\" Elsa sighed. \"They're normally never gone this long.\" \"Oh.\" Victor looked away. \"What do they do?\" \"They're philosophers. We briefly lived up in Romania and the Netherlands and my parents still get a lot of work over there, so we travel back and forth between here and there. They won't let me go with them unless it's during the summer. \"Your education is more important that traveling\" they'd always tell me.\" \"I guess that would make sense. I mean, I haven't been anywhere outside of New Holland, but I'd rather finish school before going off to see the world.\" \"Where are your parents from? Frankenstein is a pretty interesting name.\" Elsa asked. \"And Van Helsing isn't?\" Victor inquired. \"Well, my ancestry is Dutch, that's why I was the Little Dutch Girl at the Dutch Day Festival on Friday.\" \"Well… to be honest, I'm not too sure about my ancestry. I have some relatives in Italy but I think we're Genovese. It's funny, my dad used to tell me about his great uncle Fredrick Frankenstein and how he was ashamed of our family history for some bizarre, so he called himself Fredrick Fronk-en-steen instead.\" Victor laughed. \"What were they ashamed of?\" Elsa asked. \"That's just it, I don't know. There must've been a lot of crazy people in my family, I guess.\" Victor shrugged. Victor and Elsa arrived at school with ten minutes to spare before class started. They went into class, dreading having to learn science from the loud, clueless gym teacher, Coach Barnes.[Chapter 4] Victor sat at his desk in class, the last one in the front row. Normally he loved sitting in the front of the class but lately, Victor felt like it was the worst place to sit. Gym had never been Victor's strong suit and neither did he think he was athletically inclined. Elsa sat in her usual seat across from Victor; she set her bag down and pulled out her school book and pencil case, setting them neatly on her desk. Victor pulled out his school binder and opened it. Staring back at him was the picture that spawned the idea that fateful day in science class, the picture that Victor drew out of his grieving for his dog. Victor smiled down at the doodle before turning it to a new blank page. Victor looked up from his desk. \"Hey, Victor!\" Victor jumped back in his seat in surprise. \"Edgar, what are you doing!?\" Victor shouted angrily at his strange classmate. Edgar slammed his hands on Victor's desk and leaned over the desktop, Victor pulled back in his seat as far as he could. \"Victor, you did it, you did it!\" Edgar cheered. \"…What? Edgar, I don't know what you're talking about.\" Victor said under his breath. \"I think you do know!\" Edgar leaned in. Victor turned his head and looked at Edgar from the corner of his eye. \"No…\" Victor mumbled. Why is it still crazy, it's already been three days since the incident, will this ever end? \"You saved New Holland! Those sea monkeys, that goliath turtle, the mutant rat, and that vampire cat!\" Edgar shouted, throwing his hands up in the air. \"You saved everybody !\" Light, slow footsteps could be heard and Victor and Edgar turned their attention to the girl walking towards them, not a lot of people knew her name specifically and no one cared to know the girl with those big staring eyes. The girl looked down at Victor with her unwavering gaze. \"Mr. Whiskers didn't return home Friday night…\" She looked from Edgar's awkward expression to Victor's guilt ridden face. \"Victor… you saw him last… where did he head off to…?\" Victor looked at the weird girl and felt a sudden wave of guilt through his abdomen. What had happened to her freaky vampire cat? He abducted Elsa and Victor chased off after her. He saved Elsa from the bat-cat and then Sparky had saved him from the bat-cat and from the burning windmill. And then… AND THEN THE WINDMILL BURNED DOWN! And that girl's cat…! How was he supposed to tell her that her cat burned to death!? \"Uh- your cat, he… he attacked Elsa and took her to the windmill. The windmill got caught on fire and Mr. Whiskers… I'm sorry…\" Victor didn't finish his sentence. He didn't need to finish, the strange girl stared at him for a moment longer before turning away from him and walking back to her desk where she sat politely and didn't say a word, staring at nothing in particular. Elsa watched the girl walk to her desk. She turned around to try and talk to the girl, she may be strange but she was nice and an occasional friend. \"I'm sorry about what happened.\" She whispered. \"It's okay, Elsa; it wasn't your fault.\" The weird girl softly replied. This day couldn't get worse, could it? Victor sighed and turned his attention back to Edgar who was still standing in front of his desk. He saw that Edgar was looking at the weird girl with a slightly guilt look on his face… as well as a small blush on his cheeks. Victor smirked. Edgar was suddenly pushed aside, fallen to the floor by the incredibly tall Nassor, he towered over Victor's desk and gazed down at him with menacing eyes. \"Baseball practice is after school today and you are in much need of improvement if we are going to go to the championship this year.\" He hissed. Victor found himself scooted down into his chair. \"Actually, guys, I don't know if I—\" He started. \"You cannot leave the team now!\" Toshiaki walked in on the conversation, followed by his guinea pig of a friend Bob, the boy would do anything his friend would ask of him, which resulted in his broken arm. \"We won our last game because of you and besides, we can't kick you off the team. I already asked.\" Toshiaki looked around annoyed. \"Oh… okay.\" Victor sighed in defeat. \"If I have no choice…\" \"You don't!\" Toshiaki yelled and stormed back to his desk. Bob looked between Toshiaki and Victor, cheerfully saying a good morning to Victor before following Toshiaki to the desk next to his friend. \"Don't be late.\" Nassor pointed at Victor before heading back to his seat behind Toshiaki in the back of the class. Victor put his head on the desk. \"I'm dead.\" He whimpered. Edgar got up from the floor and peeked at Victor above the desk. Victor looked up and noticed Edgar right in front of his face; he jumped back in his seat. \"Will you quit doing that?\" Victor said sternly. \"You've got baseball today? Hey! You need someone to practice with, don't you? I'll practice with you!\" \"Uh, I'm pretty sure I have to practice with the team.\" Victor smiled awkwardly. \"Oh, but… but you're so horrible at baseball! You'll need practice outside of school!\" \"Gee, thanks.\" Victor rolled his eyes. \"Please, Victor! Please let me practice with you! Please, please, please ?\" Edgar insisted. The last time Victor let Edgar help him, he ratted on the whole class about bringing the dead back to life and told the students that Sparky was his science project! Victor would never bring Sparky back to life just for science! But then again, Edgar was a little like himself; he didn't have many friends. \"Okay, okay! Fine! If it'll get you off my back, we'll practice after school tomorrow.\" \"Oh thank you, thank you, Victor! You won't regret this!\" Edgar stated before rushing into his seat next to Victor. 'I hope I won't.' Victor thought, putting a hand over his face in exasperation. \"Okay, kids. QUIET, it's time for class.\" Coach Barnes said in a yell as she entered the room.[Chapter 5] The bell finally rang, signaling the end of class. Victor sighed to himself; this is going to be a long day. He gathered his belongings and got up from his desk and walk over to Elsa's. He stood in front of her desk and she looked up at him. \"I guess I have baseball practice after school today. So I won't be able to walk home with you.\" Victor said apologetic and annoyed. Elsa grabbed her things and stood up from her desk. \"That's okay, Victor. We can walk to and from school whenever you want. Maybe I'll drop off my stuff, pick up Persephone, and we can all watch you at practice. And we can walk home together after that.\" She gave him a kind smile. \"Really?\" Victor perked up. \"Yeah. Hey, if you want maybe I can pick up Sparky too?\" She asked. \"You don't mind?\" Victor asked, slightly baffled. \"Of course not. Call your parents and tell them I'm going to pick up your dog and I'll see you at practice.\" Elsa smiled and walked away. 'Great, now Elsa is gonna watch me stink at baseball.' Victor thought out loud as he walked to the front office of the school. He opened the glass door and walked up to the receptionist's desk. Victor put his hands up on top of the desk and softly cleared his throat; the lady at the desk turned her head to him. \"How may I help you, dear?\" She asked. \"Can I use the phone? I need to call my parents.\" \"Sure thing, dear.\" She pointed to the phone on the other side of the desk. \"Be sure to press 9 before you dial.\" \"Thank you.\" Victor walked over to the other side of the desk and began to dial his house. The phone rang a few times before his mother finally answered. \"Hello?\" She answered the phone confused; the school had never called her before. Had Victor gotten in trouble? Or was he in trouble? \"Mom? Hi, I uh… I have to stay after school today. I have baseball practice.\" \"Oh.\" His mother sighed. \"Is that all? I thought something bad happened.\" \"Oh, no.\" Victor chuckled. \"I just need to practice if I'm going to get any better and maybe go to the championship…\" \"Oh dear, that's wonderful. I'm so proud of you! Making friends and playing sports, I'm sure you'll be wonderful.\" \"Thanks, mom.\" Victor blushed. \"Um, my friend Elsa is going to watch me practice today—\" \"She is?!\" \"Yes, she said she would come by and pick up Sparky on her way home and bring him and her dog to the school field. Is that okay?\" Victor asked nervous, no one had ever taken care of Sparky other than Victor and his parents. \"That's fine dear, as long as you're sure you can trust her with your dog…?\" Susan questioned. \"Of course I can trust her!\" Victor said a little too quickly. \"She… she has a dog of her own, too. A black poodle, Persephone.\" \"Oh yes, that's right. Well if you trust her, I trust her too.\" Victor felt relieved at his mother's acceptance. \"I don't know how long practice is going to be; maybe an hour?\" \"Dinner is in two hours, if you're not home by then I'll save some for you in the microwave.\" \"Okay.\" \"Alright, you do good out there!\" \"Yeah… okay, bye.\" \"Bye, dear.\" Victor hung up the phone and thanked the receptionist once again before walking out the doors and heading to the baseball field. Elsa arrived at her uncle's house; she quietly opened the door and snuck in. She ran to her room and threw her stuff on the bed, Persephone ran up to her wagging her tail and jumping around her feet. Elsa hushed her dog as she grabbed the leash and clipped it onto her collar. She pulled her dog along with her as she headed back to the front door. \"Going to the baseball field at school, I'll be back for dinner!\" Elsa yelled then went out the door before her uncle got a word in edgewise. Elsa closed the door and made her way over to the Frankenstein household. She rang the doorbell. Sparky's ears perked up at the sound and began to bark at the door. \"I heard, Sparky!\" Susan called to the dog as she walked from the kitchen to the front door, with the dog leash in hand. \"That must be Elsa.\" Sparky ran around in excitement at that name. Susan opened the door to reveal Elsa and her poodle. Sparky ran to Persephone and they sniffed each other. \"Hello, Mrs. Frankenstein.\" Elsa said politely. \"You must be Elsa Van Helsing.\" Susan said as she looked at the strange girl. \"Yes, I am. Have you talked to Victor? He said I could pick up Sparky and take him to the baseball field at school.\" \"Why yes, he did.\" She smiled. Susan bent down and put the leash around Sparky's neck and handed it to Elsa. \"I trust you'll take good care of Sparky?\" Susan asked. \"Of course; Persephone and I enjoy his company.\" Elsa smiled. \"I expect Sparky to be back with my son immediately after practice.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" Elsa nodded her head obediently. Susan smiled down at the girl. \"Okay, well be careful on your walk and I hope to see you soon.\" Mrs. Frankenstein smiled. \"Okay.\" With that, Elsa set off down the street hand in hand with Persephone and Sparky. Victor walked up to the baseball field. The other boys were waiting for him and from here they didn't look too happy, Victor figured. Victor looked over at the benches, Elsa wasn't there yet… but sitting next to Bob was Edgar. He was waving towards Victor. He looked around him as he walked, no one was there. He must be waving at him; Victor tossed his hand up and continued to head to the field. Victor walked to the dugout where he set his school stuff down and the coach tossed him his baseball jersey, advising him to be here on time. Victor buttoned up his shirt and went out onto the field with the other players. Toshiaki and Nassor stood there with their arms crossed and their feet patting the dirt. \"Well, it's about time you showed up.\" Toshiaki called out to Victor. \"I had to call my mom first.\" Victor told him as he stood in front of the two bullies. \"Your mom didn't know you had practice today?\" Nassor looked at Victor with disbelief. \" I didn't even know I had practice today.\" Victor shrugged. \"Ever since Sparky…\" He looked out at the street. \"I haven't thought much about baseball since… that day.\" He looked back at the two boys. \"Fine.\" Toshiaki said, shaking his head in an annoyed manner. \"Just grab a bat and go over there; you need practice more than anybody here.\" Victor walked over to the fence and grabbed a bat; he then walked up in front of Nassor at home plate. He nervously looked over at Toshiaki and winded the bat up behind him. \"Come on, you two. Victor is waiting for us.\" Elsa chuckled as she led the two dogs down the sidewalk towards the school. Sparky and Persephone happily barked at Elsa as they continued to walk beside her. She glanced over to her left and saw the baseball field before heading over in that direction with the canines in tow. She went over to the bleachers and took a seat with both dogs sitting on either side of her just as Victor was up to bat. Toshiaki threw the ball, but Victor missed. Nassor tossed it back to his colleague; Victor missed a second time. Toshiaki groaned and shook his head. \"Victor, focus!\" He said. \"I'm trying.\" Victor replied before glancing to his left to see Elsa, Sparky, and Persephone sitting on the bleachers; he smiled at her. Elsa nodded her head at Victor and gave him a smile, indicating that she knew he can do it; he nodded back and winded up the bat again. Toshiaki waited a moment, then he threw the ball a third time… only for Victor to hit it just like he did on that first day. Now knowing what to do, Victor ran; he ran as fast as he could to each of the bases but when he was reaching home base, he slipped and clumsily slid into the base. The moment he stopped, Victor suddenly felt a sharp pain in his left arm. \"Oh my gosh, Victor! Are you okay?\" Elsa asked as she ran over to him with Sparky and Persephone. \"E-E-Elsa…?\" Victor said before everything went black.[Chapter 6] \"Victor? Victor, are you okay?\" Victor slowly opened his eyes and saw his parents and Elsa standing over him with concerned looks on their faces. He realized that he was in the local hospital. \"Honey, are you alright?\" Susan asked worriedly. \"M-Mom? Dad? What happened? Where am I—Agh!\" Victor tried to sit up, but a sharp pain near his left eye stopped him and he laid back down; he looked at his arm and saw it in a cast. He reached up to touch his head, only to feel a bandage wrapped around it. \"You broke your arm and hit your head pretty hard on the baseball field.\" Edward replied. \"I get the broken arm, but how did I hurt my head?\" Victor asked before a man in a white coat entered the room. \"When you slid, you struck the base itself and you received a concussion; almost broke the orbital bone around your eye.\" The man replied. \"Is he going to be okay, Dr. Flint?\" Elsa asked. \"He's going to be fine, dear.\" The Doctor replied. \"Luckily, Victor has a friend like you who got him over here in a jiffy.\" Victor's eyes widened in surprise before he asked, \"Elsa? You brought me here?\" She nodded and said, \"With a little help from your mom.\" Victor then heard two barks; he looked and saw Sparky and Persephone trotting into the room. Sparky hopped up onto the bed and licked his owner's face affectionately. Victor scratched the bull terrier's ears and smiled. \"Hey, boy.\" He said. \"Don't worry, I'm gonna be fine. Right, Doctor?\" \"That's right.\" Dr. Flint answered, nodding his head. \"You're going to have a black eye for a while and you'll need to keep that cast on your arm for the next three to six months, but after that you'll be good as new.\" \"Thank you so much, doctor.\" Edward said as he shook his hand. \"Of course. Now if you don't mind, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you all to leave. Victor needs his rest.\" The doctor said before leading Susan, Edward, Elsa, and the two dogs towards the door. \"Wait! Can Elsa stay, just for a little bit?\" Victor asked. \"Well… alright. But just for a few minutes.\" The doctor said as he, Edward, and Susan exited the room with Sparky and Persephone following suit. \"Something wrong, Victor?\" Elsa asked as she sat on the edge of the hospital bed. \"No, nothing's wrong. I just wanted to say… thank you.\" Victor replied. \"For what?\" \"For… getting me over here and for looking after Sparky.\" \"Oh, that. It was nothing. You helped me at Dutch Day, so I just felt I should help you in return.\" \"So… I guess this makes us even, huh?\" \"Yeah, I guess it does.\" The two tweens smiled at each other and laughed before they felt their hands touch. They pulled away and blushed in embarrassment. \"Hey, Victor!\" Both Victor and Elsa jumped at the voice. They looked at the door and saw Edgar, Bob, Toshiaki, and Nassor standing in the doorway; Nassor and Toshiaki didn't look very happy, not one bit. \"Are you okay?\" Bob asked as he and Edgar approached the bed. \"What are you guys doing here?\" Victor asked. \"We were there when your accident happened.\" Toshiaki replied. \"Now because of your new injuries, you can't be on the team anymore. At least not until your arm fully heals.\" Nassor added. \"You mean… I'm suspended from the baseball team?\" Victor asked, sounding slightly hopeful. \"For the time being… yes.\" Toshiaki and Nassor answered. 'No more baseball for six months. That's probably the best news I've heard all day!' Victor thought, smiling to himself.[Chapter 7] About three weeks had passed; Victor had his left arm in a cast and sling and a black eye, but he didn't seem to mind. Even though he couldn't properly build any new inventions nor do any big science projects or new home movies and the cast he wore itched like crazy, he was okay. And luckily, he was right handed… and Elsa was usually there to help him if he needed it. He felt more and more comfortable, happy, and safe around her; he felt she was someone he could really connect with. One day at school, Elsa approached Victor's desk in class with a rather worried look on her face. \"Hey, Victor. How's your arm doing?\" She asked. \"A little better than before.\" He replied before he looked up and noticed his friend's worried look. \"Elsa? What's wrong?\" \"Uh, it… it's Persephone. I think she's sick .\" \"Sick? Oh no. Tell me what's wrong.\" \"Well, she's been really tired lately; she's been taking more naps during the day. She's also been having trouble keeping her food down. She's thrown up four times in the past two days. I'm really worried about her.\" \"Okay, don't worry. I'm sure there's a logical explanation. Maybe we should take her to the vet after school, just to see if it's anything serious.\" \"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Thanks, Victor.\" \"No problem.\" \"Okay, kids. Quiet down. Take your seats; we have a lot to discuss.\" A woman with brown hair, glasses, and a green sweater said as she entered; the class recognized her as the sixth grade English teacher, Mrs. Winston. As Elsa promptly sat down at her desk, Victor raised his hand. \"Excuse me, Mrs. Winston? Where's Coach Barnes?\" He asked. \"Oh, she won't be teaching your class for a while.\" She replied as she turned to face the class. \" I will.\" \"Um, no offense Mrs. Winston, but do you know anything about science?\" Elsa asked, nervously raising her hand. \"Of course I do, dear. Just because I teach English doesn't mean I can't teach other things from time to time.\" Mrs. Winston replied. Victor and Elsa glanced over at each other, unsure of what was in store for them and the rest of the class. The teacher cleared her throat. \"Now before we begin, I'd like to introduce a couple of new students today.\" Mrs. Winston said as two young girls entered the room and stopped beside her; one girl had her dark hair pulled up into a bun and she was wearing a grayish yellow sweater and the other had puffy light brown hair and rectangular glasses. \"This is Hillary and Mae-Lee; they're your new classmates. Why don't you go take a seat, girls? Then we can start class.\" The two girls nodded at Mrs. Winston and they each promptly took a seat in the front row. Toshiaki and Nassor glanced at the girls curiously, not sure of what to say. The girls looked in their direction. \"Hello.\" The girl in the sweater said to them. \"My name is Mae-Lee.\" \"Hello.\" Toshiaki replied, reaching out to shake her hand. \"I am Toshiaki and this is my associate, Nassor.\" \"Hello.\" Nassor said as he shook the other girl's hand. \" You must be Hillary.\" \"Yes, you'd be correct. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" Hillary replied with a nod. \"Yes, you two seem very mature and sophisticated for your age.\" Mae-Lee pointed out. \"Thank you.\" Toshiaki said; Nassor nodded in agreement. \"Okay, that's enough. As nice as it is to see the new girls making friends already, you lot can get to know one another after class.\" Mrs. Winston said; as sweet as she was, she still had to enforce the class rules. \"Mrs. Winston?\" Edgar raised his hand. \"What are we going to do today?\" \"I was just getting to that, Edgar. Now let me see, where did you kids leave off…?\" Mrs. Winston said as she opened the binder sitting on the desk and took a look. \"Oh, it says here… we're going to do something a little different today.\" \"What do you mean 'a little different'?\" Toshiaki asked. The teacher smiled; she then walked around the classroom and gave a packet of paper to every student. On the front page it read in big bold letters: \"Make Friends Through Pen and Paper\". No one knew what it meant. \"Mrs. Winston, what is this?\" The Weird Girl asked. \"This is your new assignment.\" Mrs. Winston replied with a sly smile. The packet read that the students were required to write a one page letter and send it off on a balloon and if a letter comes back, then the students would each have a pen pal. And the letter was due the next day because that was when they would be launching them into the sky. After a long day, the bell finally rang. Victor and Elsa were walking down the sidewalk side by side on the way home… and they were discussing the assignment Mrs. Winston had just given them. \"So, what do you think of this project, Victor?\" Elsa asked. \"I don't know. I'll have to see what my parents think of it first.\" Victor replied. \"Yeah. Same goes for my uncle. I just hope he doesn't make too big a deal out of it.\" \"Uh, speaking of your uncle…\" Elsa looked up and saw Persephone lying on the front lawn of her uncle's house and she wasn't looking so good; the Mayor was standing over the poodle and glowering at her. \"Uncle Bob? What's going on?\" Elsa asked as she and Victor ran towards him. \"Your dog is acting up again.\" Mayor Bergermeister replied. \"Oh no, she looks terrible.\" Victor said, kneeling down to get a better look at Persephone. \"She looks even worse than before.\" Elsa said worriedly. \"Victor?\" Susan called as she strode towards the Mayor's house. \"Honey, what's going on?\" \"Oh, mom!\" Victor said as he looked up at his mother. \"Can you drive me, Elsa, and Persephone to the vet? We think she's sick.\" \"Oh no, the poor little thing.\" Susan said, kneeling down and gently stroking the poodle's head. \"Let's get her in the car. We can go right now; Sparky can come too.\" \"But Sparky hates the vet.\" Victor pointed out before he heard Persephone start to gag. \"Oh boy, not again.\" Elsa said, taking a small step back; Susan and Victor stood up and did the same before the poodle finally threw up right there on the walkway. Mayor Bergermeister stood in shock and disgust before he glowered at Elsa and Victor. \"I'll go get Sparky.\" Victor said before heading to the backyard of his house. \"Um… Elsa? Would you help me get Persephone into the car?\" Susan asked. \"Sure.\" Elsa replied before she picked up her beloved dog as gently as she could and went next door with Susan. \"Wait a minute, who's going to clean this up?!\" The Mayor shouted as he stood before the puddle of dog vomit on his lawn.[Chapter 8] \"Well, I'll be darned.\" The vet, Dr. Hawthorne, said as she looked at her clipboard. \"It looks like Persephone isn't sick at all… She's going to have puppies .\" \"PUPPIES?!\" Victor and Elsa screamed in shock. \"That's right.\" Dr. Hawthorne said with a smile. \"I'd say she's roughly four days in already. So you should expect the puppies to be here within the next two weeks or so.\" Victor and Elsa looked at each other, then at Sparky and Persephone; they seemed to be cuddling and smiling. It looked like they were pretty excited for puppies of their own. \"Thank you, Dr. Hawthorne.\" Susan said as she shook the vet's hand. \"Of course, Mrs. Frankenstein.\" Dr. Hawthorne said kindly. \"Now I advise that Persephone take it easy for a while; we don't want anything bad to happen to the puppies. So no rough play of any kind, understand?\" Elsa nodded before gently tying the leash to the poodle's neck and heading towards the door with Victor, Sparky, and Susan. \"Thank you, doctor.\" Elsa said before she and the others exited the vet's office. On the way back, Victor, Elsa, and Susan couldn't stop thinking about what Dr. Hawthorne had told them; in just a few weeks, Persephone was going to become a mother… and Sparky a father. \"Puppies, puppies, puppies…\" Elsa repeated under her breath. Finally, they made it back to the neighborhood. Elsa and Persephone exited the car and walked towards the Mayor's house, but not before Victor called out, \"Elsa?\" She turned around to see Victor getting out of the car and walking towards her. \"Yes?\" She asked curiously. \"I, um… I just want you to remember that… if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.\" Victor said nervously, a blush starting to form on his cheeks; Elsa blushed too. \"Thanks. And maybe we could talk about this whole… thing later on, so we can work things out.\" She said. \"Good idea.\" \"Come on, Victor. It'll be time for dinner.\" Susan called as she and Sparky entered the house. \"I'd better get going.\" \"Yeah, me too. But thanks, for all your help.\" \"No problem. See you tomorrow?\" \"Absolutely. The two smiled at each other and parted. When Elsa made it into her uncle's house with Persephone, she sighed and knelt down to look at her dog. \"I can still hardly believe it, Persephone.\" She said. \"No wonder you've been acting so weird lately.\" Persephone barked and affectionately nuzzled herself against her owner; Elsa carefully wrapped her arm around the canine in a hug. The Mayor cleared his throat. \"Uh… hi, Uncle Bob.\" She said nervously. \"So… what's wrong with that dog of yours? Anything serious ?\" Mayor Bergermeister asked. The girl looked at her dog, who looked at her worriedly; Elsa had no idea what to say. At Victor's house, Victor and Susan had told Edward everything. \"Puppies?!\" Edward exclaimed with wide eyes. \"Yep. Dr. Hawthorne said that they'll be born in a couple weeks.\" Victor said, nodding his head. \"Well I'll be… Sparky's going to be a father!\" Edward exclaimed; Sparky shot up and trotted towards the dinner table at the mention of his name. \"I still hardly believe it, dear. When we were given the news, I was genuinely floored.\" Susan said as she took her seat. \"But as exciting as this is, we'll need to be prepared for when the puppies do arrive. We'll need a plan.\" \"Yes, but what do you say we go over it a little later on down the line?\" Edward suggested. \"For now, I'd just like to enjoy dinner.\" \"Good idea.\" Victor said. \"But first… Victor, I'd like to talk to you about this new school project.\" Edward said. \"Project?\" \"This pen pal project.\" \"Oh, that. What about it?\" \"I just think… that it's a great idea!\" \"Okay dad, let me just… Wait, what?\" \"I said it's a great idea. This would be a fantastic way for you to make friends. Have you figured out what you wanted to write yet?\" \"…Not yet.\" \"Well you'd better get started on it. It's due tomorrow, isn't it?\" \"Oh yeah.\" \"But remember; if you need any help, don't be afraid to ask us.\" After dinner, Victor sat at his desk in his room looking at an open notebook and a pencil in his hand. He wanted to write a good letter, but he had never done this pen pal thing before so he had no idea what to do. Sparky was lying on the bed, looking at his owner with curious eyes. Victor groaned in frustration. \"Ugh! I just don't know!\" He exclaimed. \"There are so many things I can write, but I've got nothing !\" \"Victor?\" Susan said. \"Mom? What are you doing?\" Victor asked, turning around to see his mother enter his room. \"Nothing; it's just I couldn't help but overhear.\" \"Oh, that. Well… right now, I have no clue what to write; I just keep drawing a blank.\" \"It's okay, sweetheart. Everyone gets writer's block from time to time… Do you need any help?\" \"…Yeah, I think I do.\"[Chapter 9] The next morning at school, Victor sat at his desk with the finished letter in his hand; it had his name and house address on it, but no stamp. They were going to attach the letters to balloons and launch them into the sky that very day; he was nervous. \"Okay, does everyone have their letters ready?\" Mrs. Winston asked; everyone nodded. \"Good. Now I have the balloons all ready and they're outside right now. Are you ready?\" The class nodded. \"Then let's go. And be sure to have your letters with you at all times.\" The class got up from their desks and went out to the field; lots of brightly colored helium balloons were tied to the fence of the baseball diamond waiting for the group. \"Now form a line and grab a balloon, then attach it to your letter. But don't let go of it yet; we'll be launching them all together.\" Mrs. Winston instructed; a line was formed. Victor was standing in front of Elsa; he decided to strike up a conversation with her. \"Elsa? How did your uncle react to the… news?\" He asked in a whisper. \"About Persephone? Oh… not too well.\" Elsa replied. \"He was pretty shocked and angry about the whole thing; he kept saying things like 'That dead mongrel next door got your dog pregnant!' or something similar to that. But the worst part is… he wants nothing to do with the puppies and he's planning on selling them after their born.\" \"What?! No, he can't do that!\" He cried. \"That's what I said!\" She remarked. Then, Victor had an idea. \"Hey, I know. Why don't you and your uncle come over to my house after school today and you, me, my parents, and your uncle could talk things over? That way, we could all make a responsible decision without doing anything too drastic.\" \"Good idea… I just have to find some way to make my uncle agree.\" \"…Now that could be a problem.\" \"But I'm sure I'll think of something.\" \"Okay, you two. That's enough; you can continue your conversation after class. Now grab a balloon.\" Mrs. Winston said when Victor and Elsa made their way to the front of the line. Victor grabbed a red balloon while Elsa grabbed a blue one; Mrs. Winston added a small piece of tape to the strings. The two exited the line together and stood side by side in a circle; Hillary was standing next to Elsa. \"I couldn't help but overhear your little chat with Victor.\" She whispered. \"Something about… puppies and getting rid of them?\" \"That's none of your business, Hillary.\" Elsa hissed. \"Hey, Victor. What's all this about puppies?\" Edgar whispered. \"Is it something between you and Elsa? Can I get in on it?\" \"None of your business. And one more thing, Edgar… shut up.\" Victor shushed. \"Okay. Now that everyone has a balloon, attach it to your letter and we can launch.\" Mrs. Winston said; everyone did as they were told. \"Ready? And… go!\" The students let go and the balloons floated into the air and flew off into the sky until they finally faded from view. The school day ended as quickly as it began; Victor and Elsa walked home together, as usual, and they knew what they had to do. That night, the two children awkwardly at the table in Victor's house with Mayor Bergermeister, Susan, and Edward sitting with them; they were discussing what they were going to do with Sparky and Persephone's puppies when they were born. There was a bit of yelling, mostly from the Mayor himself, and it took a long time, but in the end… they all finally came to a reasonable agreement. \"So what you're saying is that when the puppies are born… Victor and Elsa can look after them?\" The Mayor asked. \"Why not? Half for Victor, half for Elsa; and they can even switch.\" Edward replied. \"I personally think that's a terrific idea.\" Susan said with a smile; Victor and Elsa agreed. They all looked expectantly at the Mayor who was looking at the two dogs in one corner of the room. He sat in silence for thirty seconds until he let out a defeated sigh. \"Fine.\" He said, reluctantly shaking Edward's hand. Victor and Elsa smiled, stood from their chairs, and hugged each other tightly. But they quickly pulled away in embarrassment. They looked at Edward, Susan, and the Mayor who were looking at them in surprise; they blushed and glanced away from one another.[Chapter 10] Days passed and Persephone's pregnancy progressed; she was eating more and she was rather tired and she napped more often. Victor and Elsa did their very best to care for Persephone, but she was fine especially with Sparky at her side. And during that time, a letter from an unrecognizable address arrived at Victor's house. Susan found it while she was leafing through the mail one morning. It had Victor's name on it as well as the house address, so she decided to give it to him one Saturday morning. When Susan gave him the envelope, Victor inspected at it curiously; he wondered who in England would send him a letter… until he remembered the Pen Pal Project from school. \"My balloon made its way to LONDON!\" He cried in revelation. He carefully opened the envelope and there was a picture of a boy with black hair and fair skin and wearing a pale blue sweater who looked to be his age along with a singular piece of paper. It read, \" Dear Victor Frankenstein, Hello. My name is Shamus Holmes. I'm also eleven years old and I live in London England with my father, mother, and two older sisters. May I be honest with you? I have no idea how to do this sort of thing either, so please forgive me for that. And I'm very sorry that it took me this long to respond, I only just got your letter a week and a half ago. I found it dangling from a red balloon in the old tree outside my house and I hadn't the slightest idea what to write. I'm assuming you'd like to know more about me so… here we go. Like you, I'm also in the sixth grade and I have a slight interest in science, but I also enjoy learning history and forensics. Not many people know this, but I dream of becoming a police officer someday and helping any and all people in need… as well as solve mysteries and crimes, like the main character in my favorite books, Sherlock Holmes. Isn't it funny how he and I have the same last name? Probably just a coincidence. I suppose that's it for now. Write back to me as soon as you can and if you really want to, maybe we can become friends. Signed, Shamus Holmes \" \"Shamus Holmes?\" Victor quoted as he looked at the picture of the boy; Shamus looked pretty nice and he seemed innocent enough. \"Hey, Victor.\" Edward said as he walked into his son's room; he noticed the letter and photo. \"What've you got there?\" \"Oh, this? Just… a letter from a kid in London.\" Victor replied. \" London ?\" \"Yeah, his name is Shamus. Apparently, he got the letter on my balloon.\" \"Well, that's great, son. Mind if I take a look?\" \"Go ahead.\" Edward read through the letter and smiled at his son. \"I want to write Shamus back.\" Victor said simply. \"Well nothing's stopping you, son.\" Edward replied. \"Well done. You just made a new friend.\" Victor smiled. A few more days went by and then… the big day finally came. It was a cold, rainy evening and Elsa and Persephone were having dinner over at Victor's house when it happened. When she and Sparky were cuddling in one corner of the dining room, Persephone started to whimper and cry out in pain. Elsa turned her head to look at her dog and she gasped. \"Oh my gosh, Persephone!\" She cried as she ran over to the poodle. \"Persephone, are you okay?\" \"What's wrong with her?\" Susan asked. Elsa's eyes suddenly widened in horror at the sudden realization; she looked back at the Frankenstein family. \"…I think the puppies are coming!\" She yelled. \"Wait, what? NOW?!\" Victor screamed, standing up from his chair. \"We need to get her to the vet!\" Edward exclaimed. \"Uh… It might be a bit too late for that. Her temperature dropped.\" Elsa remarked as she felt Persephone's face; it felt cooler. \"We need to act fast. We'll need a blanket, some rags, and water, STAT!\" Edward, Susan, and Victor ran in different directions to get what they needed. Victor grabbed a large blanket while Susan fetched lots of spare rags and Edward filled a bowl with tap water. The blanket was laid under Persephone and the rags and water were used to wipe up any stains. Then, it began. It took a few hours at most and Persephone was somewhat struggling, but Elsa and Sparky stayed at her side every step of the way. Then there was a knock at the door; Edward went to answer it. \"Come on, Persephone; you can do it. That's a good girl.\" Elsa said encouragingly. \"Elsa?\" Two voices asked. Elsa turned around and she gasped when she saw two people standing over her with shocked looks on their faces; it was her parents. \"Mom, Dad?!\" She cried as she stood up. \"Honey, what's going on?\" Her father, Jonathon, asked as he hugged his daughter. \"What's wrong with Persephone?\" Elsa's mother, Lydia, asked worriedly. \"She's having puppies and they're almost here.\" Victor replied. \"PUPPIES?!\" Both adults cried. \"Oh man, here they come!\" Victor exclaimed; Elsa sat back down next to him. It was truly a sight to behold; after a while, Persephone had successfully given birth to four adorable little pups, two boys and two girls. Sparky sat at the poodle's side, gently an affectionately licking her face; the bull terrier looked at the puppies, realizing that he was now a father. Elsa started crying; she felt she had just become an aunt… and Victor an uncle. \"Oh my goodness.\" Susan whispered. \"Would you look at that…?\" Edward muttered. \"They're so cute.\" Victor commented; Elsa nodded and said nothing. \"Your uncle never told us that Persephone was pregnant .\" Jonathon commented. \"When did this happen?\" Lydia added. \"About three weeks ago.\" Edward replied. \"Hey, Victor? Elsa? Have you thought about what you wanted to name the puppies?\" Susan asked the two children. \"Us?\" They asked. \"Yes; they are yours now, technically.\" Susan said. \"Hmm. I guess I haven't really thought about that until now. Have you?\" Victor asked. \"No.\" Elsa replied before she looked at the little female poodle. \"But I have always liked Anastasia.\" \"Hmmm, I like it, a lot. Hey… how about Coal?\" \"And Raven?\" \"And for the last one? …Hades.\" The two children looked at the canines huddled together before them; Persephone and Sparky nodded their heads at their owners, indicating that they like the names they picked. It wasn't just Sparky and Persephone; from now on, it was Sparky, Persephone, Coal, Raven, Anastasia, and Hades and they were all one big happy family.[Chapter 11] A couple of years went by and Coal, Raven, Anastasia, and Hades had grown up into sweet, energetic, and playful dogs; Victor, Elsa, Sparky, and Persephone took very good care of the four of them and played with them all the time. And during that time, Victor would write to his new friend, Shamus, almost every day, telling him about different exciting things that happened like the birth of the puppies and him participating in the science fair even with his still broken arm at the time. Elsa had also gained a pen pal of her own; it was a young named Kristen who lived out in New York City. During that time, Victor and Elsa had started to grow closer and closer as friends and they were almost inseparable, rarely separated. They would be seen doing homework together, studying together, and even having lunch together… which the rest of the class quickly noticed. Finally, they reached middle school. The eighth grade had started and everyone was going through puberty… and pheromones were in the air. One day in class, Edgar approached Victor's desk. \"Hey, Victor.\" The hunchback said. \"Hi, Edgar.\" Victor uneasily greeted. \"…Can I help you?\" \"As a matter of fact… you can.\" Edgar said quickly. \"I need… advice.\" \"If you want advice on doing better in baseball, then go ask Toshiaki or Nassor. I can't help you there.\" \"No, not baseball advice… I need advice on girls .\" Victor's eye widened; did he just hear the hunchback right or was he still asleep back at home? \" Girls ?\" He repeated. \"Yes.\" Edgar whispered. \"The whole school has seen you with Elsa for the past two years and I just want to know… how do you do it?\" \"Do what?\" \"How are you guys so close? Even after these several months ?\" \"Oh, uh… I don't know. I guess we just enjoy each other's company, that's all. And since Sparky and Persephone had their pups, I guess we just…grew closer.\" \"Enjoy your company, huh? …Thanks, Victor. I owe you.\" \"Hold up, Edgar… Why do you need advice on girls all of a sudden?\" Edgar froze and gulped; his eyes seemed to be glancing in a different direction… and a small blush was starting to form on his cheeks. When the teacher entered the classroom, he relaxed and quickly headed over to his seat near the back. Victor was confused and he looked to see where Edgar was looking; it was the Weird Girl sitting in the very back of the classroom. At lunch, Victor decided to investigate Edgar's behavior… which was much stranger than usual. He approached Edgar who was sitting with Bob and Toshiaki. \"Hey, Edgar? Why did you ask me that question in class?\" Victor asked. \"Uh, what question?\" Edgar asked, trying to sound innocent. \"The one about girls. What's that all about?\" Victor replied. \"Edgar? Why do you ask Victor for advice on girls ?\" Toshiaki questioned, raising an eyebrow. The hunchback froze and said nothing for a good minute before Bob asked a question of his own. \"Is this about that dance coming up?\" He asked. \"What dance?\" Victor asked as he sat down. \"You don't know?\" Toshiaki exclaimed before he took a poster out of his backpack and handed it to Victor. \"There is a masquerade dance coming up for Halloween. Everyone will be going.\" The poster was a bright red color and it was decorated with tiny black bats, a crescent moon in one corner, and jack-o-lanterns. It read: \" New Holland Junior High School Halloween Masquerade Dance \" in big bold black letters. And on the bottom of the poster was a date: \" October 20 at 5 pm \". Victor looked back at Toshiaki. \"I'm sorry, but I never heard.\" He said, handing the piece of paper back to his classmate. \"That's okay, Victor.\" Bob said sympathetically. \"But this dance still doesn't explain why…\" Victor began before glancing at Edgar who wasn't paying any attention to their conversation; he was looking at a table in another part of the cafeteria. \"Edgar? E? You okay?\" Bob asked as he shook his shoulder. \"It's like he's in a trance.\" Toshiaki commented, waving a hand in front of his face. \"What the heck is he looking at?\" Victor asked. \"Is it not obvious?\" Nassor's voice remarked; the three boys jumped and looked to see Nassor slowly approach their table and sit down. \"He is staring at her .\" Nassor pointed a finger at the Weird Girl who was sitting at the table Edgar was staring at; Edgar's eyes seemed to be glazed over and he had a rather dorky smile on his face as he leaned on his hand. \"Edgar!\" Victor cried, clapping his hands in front of the hunchback's face. \"Huh, huh? What, what? What happened?\" Edgar stuttered, snapping back to reality. \"You were staring at the Weird Girl again.\" Nassor commented. \"She has a name, you know.\" Edgar huffed. \"…It's Mindy , in case you're having a slow day.\" \"Mindy?\" Bob questioned, just oblivious as always. \"Hold on… You want to ask Weir— I mean, Mindy … to the Halloween Dance, don't you?\" Toshiaki inquired. \"What?! I-I-I-I-I, uh um…\" Edgar sputtered, trying to think of a believable fib. \"Come now, Edgar. We can see your blush; you're so red you look like a tomato. You like her, don't you?\" Nassor teased. \"Hey, leave him alone.\" Bob intervened. \"If he wants to have a crush on Mindy, let him. At least he wants to ask her to the dance. But the bad news is he has no idea how, we should help him.\" \"…Thanks, Bob.\" Edgar said. \"No problem…\" Bob said before looking back at Nassor and Toshiaki. \"And I'm just putting it out there, I know you guys each have a girl you want to ask to the dance too.\" Toshiaki and Nassor froze and looked at each other nervously; they knew exactly who he was talking about… Hillary and Mae-Lee. The four boys were so enthralled with their conversation that they didn't even notice Victor get up and find a different table to sit at. He quickly found one and took a seat next to Elsa. \"Hey.\" She greeted with a smile. \"Hi.\" He greeted back; he smiled back. \"What's going on with Edgar?\" Elsa asked. \"Oh… it's nothing.\" Victor replied. \"Hey, do you know about the Halloween Dance?\" 'What the heck did I say that for?!' He thought, doing a mental facepalm. 'Of course she knows, practically everyone in school knows!' \"Yeah, so what?\" Elsa inquired. \"…Never mind.\" He replied in defeat. Toshiaki, Nassor, Bob, and Edgar looked and saw Victor sitting next to Elsa at that different table and smiled. \"Looks like we're not alone in wanting a date for this dance.\" Toshiaki commented. \"Seems like it.\" Nassor added with a nod. Bob and Edgar looked at Victor and even though they agreed, they said nothing. After school, Victor sat at his desk, reading the latest letter from Shamus and thinking of what to write back. The letter read: \" Dear Victor, First of all, how are you? Good? I'm good too… sort of. Well, a lot has happened to me over here. My older sisters had gotten into a fight, it was very nasty. I was doing my homework, minding my own business when I heard screaming and a crashing sound from downstairs. Even though I knew what was going on, I decided to investigate anyway. I went down the stairs and I saw my sisters, Muriel and Louise, screaming and yelling at one another. I don't know what they were arguing about (I bet it was something petty and insignificant), but I felt I had to step in. So I did… and the results were pretty disastrous. I ended up getting punched in the face, which resulted in a broken and bleeding nose; I had to go to the doctor for it. Well that's all I have to write today. I'm sorry I couldn't think of anything else. But if anything exciting happens to you, let me know. Signed, Shamus \" Victor smiled before he opened a notebook, got out a pencil, and began to write. \" Dear Shamus, I'm sorry to hear about your accident and I hope you'll be okay. You know something? I never knew what it's like to have siblings, being an only child and all. But I guess it's alright; I have you and Elsa to talk to and you guys are like my practically closest friends. And speaking of Elsa… I'm planning on asking her to the upcoming Halloween dance, but I have no idea how to go about it. I know this may sound like a stretch but do you think you can help me out? But it's okay if you don't want to; I understand. Talk to you soon. Signed, Victor \"[Chapter 12] A week went by. The Halloween dance was getting closer and pretty much everyone had a date… except for Victor. He was far too scared to ask the one girl he wanted to go with, Elsa. He knew he had written to Shamus asking for advice, but he didn't get a response yet and now he felt like he couldn't wait any longer; he had to ask Elsa sometime soon or else he'll be too late. At school, Victor sat at his desk with his head buried in his notebook; it had a long list of possible scenarios on how he could ask Elsa to the dance. \"What are you doing?\" A voice asked. Victor looked up and saw Toshiaki standing at his desk with a raised eyebrow. \"May I help you?\" Victor asked. \"…You want to ask Elsa to the dance.\" Toshiaki whispered. \"But you don't have to do any of these pointless little schemes to do it.\" \"Well… what would you do? How did you ask Mae-Lee to be your date?\" \"…I just asked her.\" \"That's it?\" \"Yes. It's as simple as that. Think it over; it is worth a try. And I suggest you do it soon; it's now or never.\" He went straight to his seat. \"Hello, Elsa.\" The Weird Girl, Mindy, said to Elsa just before they entered the classroom. \"Uh, hi Mindy.\" Elsa said uneasily. \"…You want Victor to ask you to the dance, don't you?\" Mindy asked. \"H-h-h-how do you know that?\" Elsa nervously inquired. \"Edgar told me… before he asked me to be his date.\" \" Edgar ?\" Mindy blushed and smiled nervously; Elsa gently nudged her in the ribs and smirked ay her. Then Mindy's blush faded and she shook her head; she was getting off track. \"This isn't about me.\" She said before turning back to her friend. \"This is about you and Victor.\" \"Well… so what? It's no big deal, really.\" Elsa retorted embarrassedly. \"It is a big deal. You like him, don't you? AND you want him to ask you to the dance, right?\" \"Well, yeah but—\" \"But nothing . And if he doesn't ask you, then you should ask him .\" \"No! I can't do that! What if he says no? What if he laughs at me? What if he never wants to talk to me again?!\" \"He won't.\" \"How are you so sure?\" \"Because I've seen the way you two look at each other. You're closer than any other two people I've ever known.\" \"Girls? Get your hindquarters in here; it's time for class.\" The teacher said before entering the classroom. \"The dance is in TWO DAYS, Elsa. It's now or never.\" Mindy said before she and Elsa entered the classroom and took their seats. After class, Victor stood at his locker and thought about Toshiaki had said to him… and he decided to take his advice and give it a try. 'Come on, Victor.' He thought. 'You have to do it now or you'll never get another chance. This is no time to be a wimp.' He looked up and saw Elsa walking down the hall towards him. He froze. 'Oh man, there she is…' He thought. 'Maybe Mindy's right. Maybe I should step up and ask him first. It'll be quick and easy, I'm sure of it.' Elsa said to herself before she glanced up to see Victor. 'There he is now.' She walked over to him, her face turned bright red as she bit her lip. Victor glanced away from her and nervously grinned as a blush started to form on his own cheeks. 'You can do this, Victor. You can do this, you can do this.' Victor said to himself before clearing his throat. \"Hey.\" He said. \"Hi.\" Elsa replied. \"So… the Halloween Dance is this Saturday.\" \"…Are you gonna go?\" \"I'd like to, yeah but, um… d-do you think we could, oh I dunno… maybe you and I could…? I-I mean… Oh boy.\" \"What's wrong?\" Victor took a deep breath and looked Elsa dead in the eye. \"Elsa?\" He asked. \"Yes, Victor?\" Elsa questioned, a smile creeping onto her lips. \"…Will you go to the Halloween Dance with me?\" \"Yes, yes, YES!\" Elsa grinned and wrapped her arms around Victor in a hug before regaining her composure and pulling away from her friend; their faces turned bright red. \"I-I mean, uh… yeah, I'd love to.\" She stuttered. \"R-R-Really?\" Victor asked with wide eyes. She nodded and smiled before they heard the bell ring. \"Wanna head to class together?\" Victor asked, offering his hand to Elsa. \"Why not?\" Elsa replied before taking her friend's hand and going down the hall with him to their next class. \"Nice one.\" Toshiaki whispered as he watched from afar. When the day of the Halloween dance came, everyone at New Holland Junior High was getting ready. That night, Victor decided to wear a black button-up shirt with a neon green necktie, a swamp green jacket, fingerless leather gloves, black and gray striped pants, his regular shoes, and a pair of goggles from his lab in the attic; his face was painted bright green with little scars scattered about and a pair of fake bolts were attached to both sides of his neck. When Victor was ready, Susan couldn't stop taking pictures of him. \"You just look so handsome, Victor!\" Susan gushed with the camera in her hands. \"My little monster!\" \"Ugh, mom! Would you stop?! You've already taken like, 300 pictures already! It's getting embarrassing.\" The boy groaned. \"Nonsense, I've only taken—\" Susan said before Edward stepped in. \"Honey, Victor has a point.\" He said. \"He's going to be late.\" \"Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.\" Susan chuckled. \"Well, I hope you have a good time at the dance, sweetie.\" \"Thanks, mom.\" Victor said before heading towards the door. \"I'll see you guys later.\" \"Just be careful out there.\" Susan commented before handing her son a flashlight. \"Bye, son.\" Edward said. Sparky, Hades, and Raven barked happily as Victor headed out the door, leaving Susan in tears of joy. \"Oh, our son has grown up into a fine young man, hasn't he?\" She cried. \"He has.\" Edward replied, wrapping an arm around his wife's shoulder. \"Thankfully, he has such a great mother to help with that.\" \"And, of course, his dashing father helped too.\" Susan playfully said as she hugged her husband. \"No doubt about that.\" Victor towards Elsa's house and knocked on the door; Elsa's father, Jonathon answered. \"Good evening, Mr. Van Helsing sir.\" The boy said. \"Why good evening, Victor. I assume you're here to take my daughter to the Halloween Dance.\" The man said politely. \"Yes, sir.\" Jonathon smiled, turned his head, and called out in a sing-song tone, \"Oh Juliet! Your Romeo has arrived!\" \"Dad!\" Elsa's voice cried out in embarrassment. \"Excuse me; I'll be just a minute.\" Jonathon said before heading back into the house. Coal, Anastasia, and Persephone bounded towards Victor in joy; he smiled at the three dogs. \"Hey, you guys.\" Victor said, kneeling down and scratching their bellies and behind their ears; Persephone licked his face affectionately, thankfully his makeup didn't smudge. \"Hi, Victor.\" He was so focused on the dogs that he didn't hear Elsa approach; he quickly got back onto his feet. \"Hey, Elsa. Ready to…?\" Victor looked and what he saw made his eyes widen. Elsa wore a purple Victorian-style dress with a black bodice, fingerless fishnet gloves, a simple black choker necklace with a cameo pendant, pale gray tights, and black ballet slippers with ribbons laced up her legs. Her long black hair was in a big ponytail with streaks of purple and white and it was held together with a silver ribbon. She even wore a little makeup that gave her face a slight glow. When Elsa looked at Victor, her dark eyes seemed to sparkle. \"Are you okay?\" She asked. 'Whoa…' He thought. Victor opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Elsa glanced down at her costume. \"Is it too much?\" She asked. \"What? No! No way!\" Victor blurted out before pulling himself together and clearing his throat. \"Y-y-you look… amazing .\" \"Thanks.\" She said, blushing. \"Oh, hello Victor. Don't you look cute?\" Elsa's mother, Lydia said as she and Jonathon made their way to the pair; she was holding a camera in her hands. \"Not again.\" Victor mumbled in embarrassment. Lydia then took about twenty or thirty pictures of the two of them together and after bidding Jonathon and Lydia goodbye, Victor and Elsa were finally off to the dance. Lydia had started to cry, Jonathon grasped her hand. \"Our little girl is growing up!\" She wept. \"It's hard to believe, I know. But it's true; Elsa has become a beautiful young lady.\" He replied before giving his wife a kiss. They headed back into the house with Persephone, Anastasia, and Coal following close behind.[Chapter 13] Victor and Elsa walked up to the doors leading to the gym and the moment they entered, they were rather surprised. At first, they were expecting to see a lazily decorated gymnasium with cheap helium balloons and cheesy-looking Halloween décor. But they were way off; there were streamers, lots of orange and black balloons, very convincing Halloween decorations, and lights in Halloween colors. \"Wow.\" Victor said in surprise. \"I… never expected the school to go all out for this.\" \"You took the words right outta my mouth.\" Elsa muttered, nodding her head and glancing around; the she noticed the rest of the class in one corner of the gym laughing and talking. \"Hey Victor, look.\" They were all dressed in various costumes; Mindy was dressed as Alice from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland with Edgar as the White Rabbit, Toshiaki was dressed in samurai armor while Mae-Lee was wearing a trench coat and a surgical mask, Nassor was in royal Egyptian garb and gauze on his arms and legs while Hillary wore the garb and jewelry of a matching Egyptian queen, and Bob was dressed as a sailor while his own date, a girl named Jenny, was in a mermaid-styled outfit. Edgar noticed Victor and Elsa standing at the gym entrance and he yelled, \"Victor!\" Victor froze and awkwardly smiled as the group approached him and Elsa. \"Hey, guys.\" He said. \"Whoa, you two look great.\" Bob commented. \"Thanks, Bob.\" Elsa replied before turning her head towards Mae-Lee. \"Hey, Mae-Lee? No offense, but what are you supposed to be? What's your costume?\" Mae-Lee said nothing as she removed her surgical mask to reveal long red scars running through her cheeks. Victor and Elsa gasped. \"Oh my gosh! Mae-Lee, what happened to you? Are you okay?\" Victor asked worriedly; Mae-Lee only laughed in response. \"That is exactly what I said when I went to pick her up.\" Toshiaki laughed along with her. \"Don't worry, my friends.\" Mae-Lee said calmly as she took a large pair of scissors out of her trench coat. \"These scars are just makeup. But to answer your question, Elsa, I am dressed as Kuchisake-Onna, or the Slit-Mouthed Woman.\" \"It is a famous ghost story from Japan; it has been told for centuries.\" Toshiaki explained. \"A long time ago in the Japanese Heian period, a samurai was married to a beautiful woman; she was the object of everyone's affection and she knew it. She would go around the village and ask those who stared, 'Am I pretty?' The samurai was not happy with the attention she was drawing to herself and when he discovered that she was being unfaithful, he flew into a jealous rage and he wanted her to pay.\" \"What did he do?\" Edgar asked, intrigued by the story. \"One night, armed with a knife, he attacked her.\" Mae-Lee continued. \"He pressed the blade into her cheek and slit her mouth from ear to ear, leaving her with a bloody twisted grin. 'Who will think you are beautiful NOW?' The samurai asked her as she bled and wept. Soon afterwards, she died and returned to Earth as an angry spirit known as Kuchisake-Onna who carries a huge pair of scissors which she uses to kill anyone she came across.\" \"Has anyone ever seen her?\" Mindy inquired. \"Not that I know of.\" Mae-Lee replied, shaking her head and putting the surgical mask back on. \"So… those scissors you're holding aren't real?\" Victor asked. \"Oh, heavens no. I made them out of cardboard, popsicle sticks, craft foam, and paint. What do you think?\" \"They're really cool.\" Bob commented. \"Thank you.\" \"Ahem. Attention! Attention, everyone!\" A voice said. The group turned to face the stage and saw Mr. Bradford, the theater teacher, onstage standing in front of a microphone. He was wearing a Shakespearean outfit, complete with tights and poofy sleeves… which made a couple of students laugh under their breath. \"Good evening and welcome to New Holland Junior High's Halloween Masquerade Dance.\" Mr. Bradford proudly announced; the students in attendance politely clapped their hands. \"We have a pretty big night planned. First of all, there's going to be a costume contest held at 6:30 and then at 7:00, there will be a dance contest now is your chance to sign up for either one or both if you want; the sign-up sheet is right next to the snack table. And finally at the end of the evening, we will be crowning the King and Queen of the Masquerade. Anyone is allowed to participate and the winners will be announced at 8:00 when the Dance has finally come to a close so be sure to cast your votes now. Have fun tonight.\" And with that, he stepped away from the microphone and walked off the stage. Toshiaki, Nassor, and Edgar were staring at one another before heading over to the snack table, most likely to sign up for both the costume and dance contests. Jenny shook her head. \"Do they have to compete in everything ?\" She asked. \"Some days are better than others.\" Bob replied before he and Jenny walked back over to the snack table. Over the course of the evening, everyone was having fun. Nassor, Hillary, Toshiaki, Mae-Lee, Edgar, and Mindy signed up to be part of both the costume and dance contests later on and Victor and Elsa… well, they just spent time together. They talked, they laughed, they ate a little bit, and they just had a grand old time. Then at about 6:30, Mr. Bradford's voice came on over the loudspeaker. \"Hey, kids. It's time for the costume contest. Whoever signed up, form a single-file line and we'll begin very soon.\" He said as the students who are part of the contest formed a line near the stage. There were lots of kids, including Nassor, Edgar, and Toshiaki and their dates. But in the end, Edgar and Mindy were the winners while Nassor and Hillary got second place and Toshiaki and Mae-Lee were in third. Then at exactly 7:00, music had started to play, which was most likely the start of the dance contest. The competing students danced and danced while the rest of the school watched with wide eyes. And it ended in a tie between Edgar and Toshiaki… since Nassor couldn't dance to save his life. But luckily, Hillary didn't seem to care. Then a slow song had started to play. \"Well, I think now is about time for a bit of a slow dance.\" Mr. Bradford said. \"So grab that special someone, head out onto the dance floor, and hold them close.\" The lights dimmed and the students all went out onto the dance floor. Elsa smiled as she glanced over at Victor; he looked at her and smiled nervously. \"…You wanna dance, Elsa?\" He asked, offering his hand to her; Elsa grinned. \"Yes, yes! Oh, I mean… I'd love to.\" She replied, quickly composing herself. Victor took Elsa's hand and they made their way to the middle of the dance floor. He slowly snaked a hand around her waist and held her hand in the other before they started to slowly glide across the floor. Victor had never learned to dance before, but that didn't seem to stop him from waltzing with his date. Then he noticed Elsa's graceful movements and strides as they danced. \"Hey, where'd you learn to dance like this?\" He asked in a whisper. \"Promise you won't tell?\" Elsa asked quietly. Victor nodded before she leaned in and whispered into his ear, \"My uncle has been forcing me to take ballet lessons… and I don't like it.\" \"Why?\" \"Because he thinks it would be good for me for some bizarre reason. And he won't let me quit, no matter what I do.\" \"Well… you're really good.\" \"You really think so?\" \"Yeah.\" Elsa smiled and blushed; Victor did the same. As they danced, some of the other students had noticed and they went out and made some more room, forming a circle around Victor and Elsa. However, they were so enthralled with their dancing and each other that they didn't seem to notice everyone watching them. Then as the music faded to a slow, steady finish, Victor and Elsa stopped and the entire school clapped their hands in applause, which made the two gasp in shock and blush in embarrassment. \"Whoa…\" Elsa murmured. \"Yeah, I completely forgot that we weren't alone.\" Victor added. \"Okay, everyone.\" Mr. Bradford said into the microphone; the students directed their attention to the stage. \"The results are in and now, it's finally time to announce the King and Queen of the Halloween Masquerade.\" \"Finally.\" Nassor muttered. \"Let's see who wins.\" Toshiaki added. Mr. Bradford held up an envelope, opened it, and said, \"The Halloween Masquerade Dance's King and Queen are… Victor Frankenstein and Elsa Van Helsing.\" \" Us ?!\" Victor and Elsa exclaimed in shock. \"That's right. Come on up and receive your crowns.\" The teacher said as he gestured the pair to come on to the stage. The rest of the students clapped their hands in applause; Nassor and Toshiaki weren't very pleased but they clapped anyway, just to be polite. Elsa and Victor made their way onto the stage in front of everyone and right next to Mr. Bradford. He turned, took a king's crown that was sitting on a pillow, and placed it on Victor's head while another teacher took a queen's tiara and put it into Elsa's hair. \"Congratulations, you two. And you can keep the crowns.\" Mr. Bradford said. \"Hey, how about a kiss?!\" Edgar shouted; Victor and Elsa froze and blushed. \"Why not?\" Mindy agreed, shrugging her shoulders. \"I agree! We need a kiss to properly end this dance.\" Toshiaki commented as Nassor nodded in agreement; Mae-Lee and Hillary nodded as well. \"Come on, guys! Kiss, kiss, kiss!\" Bob cheered. \"Bob!\" Bob's mother cried out from the snack table. Thinking fast, Victor grabbed the microphone and said, \"Okay, okay. Instead of a kiss, why not just one more dance before we all head home?\" \"One more dance is fine.\" Mr. Bradford said before Victor and Elsa headed back to the dance floor quick as lightning. The dance had finally come to an end and everyone was on their way home. Elsa and Victor had walked out the door and were heading down the sidewalk when Victor thought of something. \"Hey, Elsa?\" He asked. \"Yeah?\" Elsa asked. \"I just remembered, my dad gave me a bit of money and I was wondering… do you, uh… you wanna go get some ice cream? It's only a block away.\" \"Ice cream? …Sure, I'd love to.\" \"Then follow me, my Queen.\" \"Why of course, my King.\" She playfully took his arm and they laughed as they walked over to the ice cream shop. At the shop, Victor got cookies-n-cream and Elsa got mint chocolate chip. Then they went over to the park and sat down on a bench to eat their ice cream and talk. And the moment they finished their ice cream, they got up from the bench and headed back to the neighborhood. They stopped at the door of Elsa's house. \"Thank you, Victor.\" Elsa said. \"I've had such an amazing time tonight.\" \"Me too.\" Victor replied before looking her in the eye. \"You know, Elsa… I've had a thing for you since that very first day of school.\" Elsa's cheeks suddenly turned red as she looked at him and said, \"Really? I… I've had a thing for you too, Victor.\" Victor's eyes widened and he started to blush too. And then, he grabbed her by the shoulder, leaned in, and pressed his lips against hers. Elsa's eyes widened in shock and her heart beat faster and faster before she closed her eyes and started kissing him back. She never wanted it to end but after a few seconds, they broke away. \"That was…\" He stammered. \"…nice.\" She finished. Neither of them said a word for what felt like a half hour. Victor awkwardly cleared his throat. \"So, uh… I guess I'll see you at school?\" He asked. \"Yeah, school.\" Elsa replied before surprising Victor with a peck on the cheek. \"Um, bye.\" \"Bye.\" Victor said before Elsa opened the door and went into the house. On his way back to his house, Victor still couldn't believe what just happened; he just kissed the girl he's been crushing on since the first day of kindergarten. And when he finally made it home, his parents and the dogs greeted him with overenthusiastic smiles and happy barks. \"Hey, son. How was your night?\" Edward asked. \"Did you have fun?\" Susan added. \"Yeah, I had… a lot of fun.\" Victor replied before heading up to his room in a daze. \"Victor? Son, are you okay?\" Edward asked before he heard the door to his son's bedroom close; he looked back at his wife. \"What was that all about?\" Susan just shrugged at him in response, just as confused as he was. If they could, the dogs would've done the exact same thing. In his room, Victor took off his costume, cleaned the makeup off of his face, changed into his pajamas, and collapsed onto his bed with a huge smile on his face. After replaying the entire night in his head, he realized something before he went over to his desk, opened his notebook, and began to write. \" Dear Shamus, I think I'm falling in love with Elsa… \"[Chapter 14] Victor went to school on Monday, only to see everyone giving him very weird looks and giggling at him and he had no idea what was going on. When he met up with Elsa in class, he asked her, \"Elsa, do you know what's going on with everyone today?\" \"No clue.\" She answered, shrugging her shoulders. It was then that Edgar, Mindy, Toshiaki, and Nassor all came into the classroom; they saw Victor and Elsa sitting together and they approached them. \"Hey, guys.\" Edgar said slyly. \"Hi, Edgar. What are you guys doing here?\" Victor asked. \"We're here for class. What else?\" Nassor replied; Mindy and Edgar giggled. \"But is something going on?\" Elsa asked. \" You tell us .\" Toshiaki answered. \"…How was your kiss ?\" Victor and Elsa froze as they looked at each other wide eyes; they looked back at their friends. \"W-w-w-what are you talking about?\" Victor nervously stammered, trying to sound innocent. \"You must be going crazy, Toshiaki.\" Elsa quickly added, rubbing her hands nervously. \"Don't be like that.\" Nassor said. \"We know all about what happened after the Halloween Dance.\" \"Like how you went out for ice cream afterwards… and how you kissed on Elsa's doorstep.\" Mindy commented with a sly smile. \"How do you know about that?\" Victor asked. \"We saw the whole thing on our way home from the dance.\" Edgar said. \"We saw you two talking and laughing about something and then… you KISSED.\" \"…So you told the whole school ?!\" Elsa snapped. \"They told us first.\" Nassor commented. \"But they had a right to know.\" Mindy said, shrugging her shoulders and smiling. \"You guys just violated our privacy! Are you CRAZY?!\" Victor yelled. \"But you like each other, do you not?\" Nassor questioned. Victor was about to speak when he paused and looked back at Elsa who was blushing at him; he said nothing as a blush formed on his cheeks as well. \"Just as I thought.\" Nassor said smugly; Toshiaki smiled and nodded. \"So when are you guys gonna start dating ?\" Edgar asked enthusiastically. \"Shut it, Edgar!\" Elsa cried out. \"But as of now, the entire school thinks you two are perfect for one another.\" Toshiaki pointed out. \"What makes you say that?\" Victor asked, folding his arms. \"Okay, kids. Quiet down. It's time for class.\" The teacher said as he entered; the group went back to their seats. Instead of paying attention to the lesson, Victor thought long and hard about what his friends had said. Were he and Elsa really meant for each other? Well he did confess his feelings to her on the night of the Halloween Dance and he did kiss her. Maybe it could work out. But then he thought about the Mayor and Elsa's parents… and his own parents. What would they think? The Mayor would probably kick him out of town, or WORSE… her father could very well kill him if he really wanted to. The bell rang. At lunch, Victor and Elsa sat together as usual. \"Elsa, can I talk to you about something?\" He asked. \"Is it about what Edgar, Mindy, Nassor, and Toshiaki said?\" She replied. \"…Yeah.\" \"Well… I personally think we're a little young to date. But even if we do start to date, what do you say we do it later on down the line? Like when we're in high school or college or something?\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. Nobody can just rush into this sort of thing; it takes time, work, and a lot of effort. From what I heard, relationships are hard even under the best of circumstances. I heard that they're not always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for… according to my mom and dad. You know what I mean?\" After thinking it over for a little bit, Victor looked back at Elsa and nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, you're right.\" He said. \"We should wait.\" \"Then it's agreed.\" They shook hands and smiled before they started to eat their lunch. After school, Elsa went home… only to see her parents and her uncle waiting for her in the living room. The room was silent and Elsa felt very nervous and uncomfortable; she cleared her throat. \"Uh… what's going on, guys?\" She asked. \"Did you kiss that Victor Frankenstein boy?\" Mayor Bergermeister asked with a scowl. Elsa froze in terror. \"…W-w-what?\" \"And is it true that you kissed him back?\" The Mayor added. The girl had no clue what to say; she just hung her head in shame and said nothing. \"So it's true.\" Bergermeister concluded as he stood from the sofa and walked towards his niece. \"Uncle Bob, before you say anything… Victor and I did kiss.\" Elsa admitted. \"But who cares? I really, really, REALLY like Victor and he really likes me back. He and I talked earlier today and we decided that if we did want to date, we would do it later when we're OLDER. And I don't care what you're going to say next; I'm NOT going to stop seeing Victor, whether you like it or not, and there's nothing any of you can say or do that will change my mind! Get the picture?\" Elsa glared daggers at her uncle who took a step back. The Mayor nervously looked over at Jonathon and Lydia for some form of help. Lydia stood up and went over to her daughter. \"Elsa… we're not angry, upset, or ashamed.\" She said calmly. \"You're not?\" Elsa asked as she relaxed her tense muscles. \"We're NOT?\" The Mayor rudely questioned; Lydia quickly shushed him by nudging her elbow hard into his ribs. \"Of course not.\" Jonathon added. \"Sweetie, we're just a little surprised.\" \"B-b-but how did you find out?\" The girl asked nervously. \"We received a call from the principal saying that almost every student at school was spreading rumors about you and Victor after the Halloween Dance.\" Lydia replied. \"And we're proud that you decided to wait until you were older to get into this whole dating business.\" Jonathon said reassuringly. \"Yes, you're far too young to date.\" The Mayor commented. \"Stay out of this, Bob.\" Jonathon hissed; his brother-in-law stayed quiet. \"We're just glad you're thinking maturely about this.\" \"Thanks, guys.\" Elsa said as she hugged her parents; Persephone, Hades, and Coal entered the room and happily joined the group hug. At Victor's house, Victor was confronted by his parents as well. They sat at the kitchen table in silence for a minute or two before Edward finally decided to speak. \"Son… is it true that you kissed Elsa from next door?\" He questioned. Victor's brow furrowed as he looked at his father; he looked him in the eye and sternly said, \"So what if I did kiss her? Didn't you guys want me to go out and make friends? Well, I'm doing it. I REALLY like Elsa and she likes me too and there's nothing either of you can do or say that will stop me from seeing her!\" Edward and Susan looked at each other, then at their son in shock and surprise. Susan put a hand on Victor's shoulder. \"Sweetheart… we're not upset.\" She said. \"You're not…?\" Victor asked. \"Of course not.\" Edward added. \"But you and Elsa are too young to start dating.\" \"Way ahead of you, dad. Elsa and I talked earlier today and agreed that we're not gonna rush into this sort of thing. We're going to wait until we're older to start dating, if we ever decide to.\" Victor replied. \"Really?\" Edward asked; the boy nodded. \"Wow, that's… a very wise and mature choice, son.\" \"And we're really proud of you for it.\" Susan added with a smile. \"Thanks.\" Victor said as he hugged his parents; Sparky, Anastasia, and Raven came in and joined the embrace.[Chapter 15] Four years have passed and Victor and Elsa are now seventeen years old in their final year of high school. They've decided to become boyfriend and girl friend a long time ago, since the first day of freshman year. When it was first announced, the whole school had been in an excited uproar; after all, the couple the school had been routing for was finally coming true before their eyes… with Edgar, Mindy, Nassor, and Toshiaki taking the credit, of course. Around the same time, Mindy and Edgar had started dating as well… thanks to the encouragement of Bob and his new girlfriend Jenny. Be at lunch, in the library, or out on a date, Victor and Elsa were always seen together; they always felt at home around one another and they wouldn't have it any other way. One stormy night while they were watching a black-and-white horror movie at Victor's house, Elsa was awfully quiet and Victor was growing very curious. They were lounging on the couch side by side; she leaned up against him as he wrapped his arm around her shoulder. \"You okay, Els?\" Victor asked. \"…I'm worried about Persephone.\" Elsa suddenly commented. \"Is she sick?\" He asked as he got up and pressed a button to pause the movie. \"Yeah. And… she is getting older.\" Victor knew exactly where his girlfriend was going with this and he had to swallow the lump in his throat. \"Elsa, you know I promised my parents that I—\" \"I know, I know.\" Elsa sighed as she nuzzled against her boyfriend; he held her hand. Victor knew perfectly well that Persephone was mortal and that when Death decided to pay anyone a visit, there would be no turning back. But then he remembered Sparky and their four pups; he wondered about they would handle her death and his resolve weakened. He knew that Sparky would not want to live without his soul mate. Maybe… maybe now was the time to finally let go. \"Victor? You can press play now.\" Elsa's voice said. But he didn't. The boy sighed as he turned the horror movie back on, but he was unable to concentrate on the event happening on the screen before them. Later that night, at about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, the phone rang. Victor was suddenly woken up by the sound of his bedroom door opening; he groaned as he sat up and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. \"Mom? It's the middle of the night, what's going on?\" He yawned. \"Honey? Phone's for you. It's… Elsa.\" Susan said. Somehow, Victor knew why his girlfriend was calling now before he could even ask what was wrong. He got out of bed, took the phone, and said into it, \"Hello, Elsa?\" \"V-Victor?\" 'Oh no, the tone in her voice…' He thought; he knew she was crying. \"Elsa, what's wrong?!\" \"It's Persephone. I woke up to get a drink of water and… and I found her. She's…\" Elsa's voice faded, and Victor completely understood what she was trying to say; his face fell. \"Oh… you want me to come over?\" \"Please. I know you made a promise, but PLEASE; bring her back. It isn't fair that you can have your dog forever and I can't have mine. Sparky would be happier with her too…\" Victor bit his lip as he thought through his girlfriend's words, feeling like he might make himself cry. \"Sparky would be happier with Persephone, and so would the pups. I know it's not fair, and I know you want her back. I can't fix one, but the other two…\" There was a pause on the other end. \"Victor, no; I didn't mean it like that.\" \"No… It would be better.\" He looked up to where the attic was supposed to be; that was where Sparky usually slept. \"No! Victor, you can't put Sparky down!\" \"I'm not practicing euthanasia. I just… I think I should just turn off his electricity. He's charging right now, so it shouldn't take too long.\" \"Don't! You shouldn't have to lose your dog just because I lost mine. You need him!\" \"He's not my only friend anymore.\" Victor bit back his own tears, finally realizing what he'd been denying. \"I have you, and Edgar, and Bob…\" \"But you still need him! All of the trouble you went through to bring him back… does that mean nothing to you?\" \"Elsa, calm down. I have to lose him eventually, don't I? …And I have to learn how to let go.\" \"How are you so calm about this?!\" 'I'm not.' \"I… I don't know; I guess I just have to be.\" After a long moment of silence, Elsa finally spoke again. \"Maybe we can bury them together.\" \"…I bet they'd like that.\" \"Can we keep talking? I don't think I can go back to sleep right now.\" \"…Me neither.\" \"Thanks, Vic.\" \"No problem, Els.\" Meanwhile, Susan and Edward sitting in the other room and watching and listening to everything their son was saying. A few days went by. It was Sunday when Sparky finally breathed his last, a fairly relieving and devastating moment as Persephone was starting to be beyond help of any kind. A soft drizzle followed the gray morning as the young couple made their way up the hill in the Pet Cemetery, carrying their dogs in the same box between them. Raven, Hades, Coal, and Anastasia were sadly following close behind. \"Here's to the cutest, sweetest dog couple that ever lived.\" Elsa muttered as she helped her boyfriend set the box into the hole that was dug the day before. \"May they forever rest in peace.\" Victor added softly. \"And forever rest together.\" Victor was a little startled when he felt his girlfriend's gentle hand grasp his own; he wasn't expecting any form of affection today. She rested her head on his shoulder, trying her hardest not to cry. The two held hands in silence, looking down at the hole at the blank top of the box before Victor picked up a nearby shovel and began to cover the hole. The four pups laid themselves down near the grave together as the hole was finally covered with dirt; they whimpered softly, as if they were crying. As of today, Victor was finally letting go… but at least he didn't have to do it alone.[Chapter 16] \" Dear Victor, I'm so sorry about what happened to Sparky and Persephone; my condolences to both of them and you and Elsa. Speaking of Elsa, I'm glad to hear that you two are together. Judging by the photos you sent me, you two make a beautiful couple… if you don't mind me saying so. I wish I knew what it was like to have someone as loving and caring as Elsa close to me. Sorry if I'm rambling. But I hope to talk to you again soon, my friend. Signed, Shamus \" Victor read over the letter from Shamus a few more times; this was from four years ago and he hasn't received another letter since. Victor was starting to worry about his friend; he hoped nothing bad had happened to him. His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a knock at the door. He went to answer it and there was Elsa in her graduation gown and cap with a big smile on her face; it was their college graduation day. They both majored in science while Elsa had a minor in history and Victor had a minor in veterinary studies. They've been dating for the past seven years, they graduated high school as a pair, and now they were graduating college as a couple. \"You ready?\" She asked. \"…I am now.\" Victor replied as he took his girlfriend's hand and walked out the door with her. As the ceremony began, the Dean stood in the center of the stage as the crowds of proud parents and little siblings cheered and clapped their hands in applause. Dean Talbot recited his opening speech, talking about how proud he was of every single one of the graduates standing here today. He then began listing off the names of the students one by one, each one of them rising from their chair and receiving their diploma from the Dean when they were called. Victor and Elsa sat next to one another in the students' seating area, holding hands and nervously waiting for their names to be called. About three quarters through, Victor noticed that neither of their names had been called yet, despite 'E' names already having passed. Why hadn't they been called yet? Soon enough, pretty much everyone except Victor and Elsa had been given their diploma. Elsa looked around, confused and slightly worried. 'What was going on?' She asked herself. \"Victor Frankenstein and Elsa Van Helsing.\" The Dean announced as he beckoned the couple onto the stage. Blushing furiously, Elsa followed Victor onto the stage and they stopped, standing before the Dean. \"I am very proud of the both of you.\" Dean Talbot began. \"You are the highest ranking students and valedictorians this University has ever seen, starting out at the age of seventeen. And it is my pleasure to grant you the highest honor this school can bestow that of the Hound.\" The Dean reached behind him, pulled out two scrolls, and gave one to Victor and Elsa. Within the scrolls were small golden badges in the shape of shields, each with the silhouette of the head of a noble dog in the center. With proud smiles, Elsa and Victor fastened their badges onto their graduation gowns with their diplomas in hand. The Hound Award was awarded to only the best of the best, the students who really caught the eye of the Dean. Today was truly the greatest day in Elsa and Victor's lives. As they turned to face the cheering crown before them, Dean Talbot tapped Victor on the shoulder and gave him a small package. Victor grinned as Talbot gave him a sly wink; Elsa watched this exchange with confusion… she didn't even see the box in her boyfriend's hand. What was going on? Victor then turned to face Elsa, his dark eyes looking deep into hers. He got down on one knee and opened the small box, which revealed an absolutely beautiful ring. Elsa's eyes began to fill up with tears as the crowd gasped. \"Elsa Van Helsing?\" Victor began. The room quickly went silent. \"Y-y-yes, Victor?\" Elsa replied hesitantly. \"…Do you love me?\" Elsa's lower lip trembled and tears streamed down her cheeks; she slowly nodded. \"…Yes.\" \"Then… will you marry me?\" Victor grinned a hopeful smile up at her, his warm gaze lighting up Elsa's heart and soul; more tears of joy fell from her eyes. \"Yes, yes, YES!\" She cried as Victor took the ring out of the box and placed it onto her finger. Victor stood up before Elsa wrapped her arms around him in the biggest hug she could muster; he returned the embrace. The crowd roared and Dean Talbot beamed before the young couple shared a passionate kiss. 'This really is the best day ever.' Elsa thought.[Chapter 17] Victor and Elsa's engagement lasted well over four months and during that time, they planned the wedding themselves… with a little help from their families, of course. Mayor Bergermeister persisted on taking on the project himself, but Lydia and Jonathon politely told him to back off and leave the wedding planning to the bride and groom themselves. The four months passed; it was the night before the wedding and Elsa, Lydia, and Susan were gathered together in Elsa's house for a small little gathering in celebration. \"Here's to you, dear.\" Susan raised a glass of cider. \"Congratulations.\" \"Oh, my little girl's getting married !\" Lydia sobbed. \"I'm so proud of you!\" \"Mom!\" Elsa smiled in embarrassment. \"How are you feeling, Elsa?\" Susan asked. \"A little nervous.\" The young bride-to-be replied. \"And REALLY excited.\" \"This is all so wonderful, sweetheart.\" Lydia beamed. \"You know, this is almost exactly like the bachelorette party my friends threw for me before I married your father.\" \"I remember my bachelorette party, too.\" Susan chimed in. \"Thought it wasn't anything big or flashy; just me, my mother, my grandmother, Edward's mother, and my closest friends. Nonetheless, I couldn't be any happier for you, Elsa. My son is very lucky to have someone like you.\" \"Thanks, Mrs. Frankenstein.\" \"Please, you don't have to be so formal. I'll be your mother-in-law soon, just call me Susan.\" \"Sure, Susan.\" Elsa giggled. \"So, dear, do you have any last-minute requests before tomorrow?\" Lydia asked. Elsa thought for a moment or two before she answered, \"No, I don't think so. I think you and dad already have everything covered.\" \"If you say so.\" Lydia wrapped her arm around her daughter's shoulder in a hug; the three women laughed. At the Frankenstein house, Victor was holding a similar celebration with Edward, Jonathon, and even Mayor Bergermeister. \"I've got to give you credit, Victor.\" The Mayor admitted. \"When I first heard about you and my niece, I didn't think it would last the week. And yet, here you are, about to marry her.\" \"Yes, you've been together since your freshman year of high school. What a way to commit.\" Edward said, putting a hand on his son's shoulder. \"Thanks, dad.\" Victor smiled at his father. Bergermeister's eyes narrowed at the groom-to-be grimaced. \"Don't push it.\" \"Sorry.\" Victor said as he grinned nervously. \"Oh lighten up, Bob!\" Jonathon admonished him. \"I, for one, am overjoyed about you joining our family, son.\" \"So am I, sir.\" Victor sighed. \"Elsa is, well… she's the one for me. I can't imagine being with anybody else.\" \"Well, I'm glad to hear that. My daughter is very, VERY lucky to have someone like you in her life. Hey, I think we'd better call it a night, fellows.\" Jonathon suggested. \"We want to get up bright and early for tomorrow.\" \"You said it, dad-in-law.\" Victor nodded. \"Goodnight, guys.\" \"Night.\" The others chorused, filing out of the house. Victor cleared up everything, then got ready for bed. As per tradition, he wasn't permitted to see his bride until the wedding, lest the union be cursed with bad luck. It was nothing but a superstition, but he preferred not to risk it. He climbed into bed, visions of his love on his mind until he drifted off to sleep, and even after. The next morning, Elsa was practically pushed out of bed by Lydia, who had her hair up in a towel and was dressed in a fuzzy bathrobe; she looked like she just got out of the shower. \"Mom…?\" Elsa moaned, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. \"Wakey-wakey, my little bride-to-be!\" Lydia cheered. \"We need to get you ready!\" \"I… I don't remember ordering a wake-up call.\" Elsa grumbled. \"There'll be time for sarcasm later, sweetie.\" Her mother said, unfazed. \"Now, let's get you all dressed up for your big day!\" Elsa was almost pushed into the bathroom, where she woke up after a nice hot shower. After that, she went downstairs and had a quick, but filling breakfast. Then Elsa proceeded to get dressed, along with everyone else. By now, she felt wonderful, ecstatic. She felt like she had an endless amount of energy, as if she had slept for a hundred years. As Elsa was humming the wedding march to herself, Lydia combed and styled her daughter's hair into a sleek bun. Then the dress came on; it was pure white with lavender accents and a lace top, the skirt had a bit of a train, and long, silvery, fingerless satin gloves were on her hands. The shoes came next, which were basically plain white slippers with a small heel and small lavender bows over the segment covering her toes. And finally, the veil; it was the finest sheer silk, topped with a ring of pearls and tied around her bun. Elsa looked in the mirror and gasped as she stared at her reflection with wide eyes; was this real or was this all just a dream? She pinched herself, it was real. \"What do you think?\" Lydia asked; she was already in her dress. \"I… I look… incredible!\" Elsa exclaimed, tears of joy running down her face. \"Thank you so much, mom.\" \"Don't go giving me all the credit.\" Lydia replied humbly before giving her daughter a hug. \"I just picked out the dress; you did the 'looking incredible' part yourself.\" Elsa gave a little twirl before her uncle's voice sternly said, \"Hold it!\" A camera flashed, temporarily blinding her. It was from her father's camera. Elsa ended up posing for multiple pictures by herself, then with her mother, then her uncle, and then her father. Eventually, Elsa said, \"How many more pictures do we have to take? I'd rather not be late for my own wedding.\" \"A bride is expected to be late for her wedding.\" Jonathon chuckled. Elsa rolled her eyes and frowned, but her frown was barely visible because she was so happy. \"Just twelve.\" Her father replied. After those twelve photos, they all climbed into the limousine that was waiting outside, which as headed towards its destination, the church. Inside, the entire room was packed with guests; Victor and Elsa's families and many old friends from school (from middle school, high school, and even college). Reverend Campbell was standing center stage at the altar, having happily agreed to conduct the ceremony. The groom was nervously awaiting his bride's arrival, his father standing right next to him. \"You okay, son?\" Edward asked. Victor looked over at Edward and said, \"Yeah, I'm fine; just a few butterflies in my stomach.\" \"Well don't worry. I was just as nervous as you on the day I married your mother.\" Edward explained. \"But everything will be fine, trust me.\" \"Thanks, dad.\" \"No problem.\" The music started to play and everyone turned around to face a beautiful sight at the very end of the entrance of the church, Elsa. Victor gaped at the vision of beauty that had just arrived. \"Whoa…\" He sighed. Jonathon stood by his daughter's side as she walked down the aisle, a bouquet of flowers held in her hand. Victor smiled happily at Elsa. He still couldn't believe that his secret crush ever since kindergarten would soon become his wife; as crazy as it sounds, it was almost feeling like yesterday when he first met her. Jonathon then stepped aside as she reached the altar. Elsa climbed the steps, standing practically nose to nose with Victor; they turned their heads to face Reverend Campbell, who was smiling very warmly for an older man. \"Friends, family…\" He began. \"We are all gathered here today to celebrate the union of Victor Charles Frankenstein and Elsa Anais Van Helsing. Before we begin; if there is anyone who rejects today or doesn't think these two should be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.\" Victor took Elsa's hand, who gladly accepted it, and took a small step closer to him, smiling as much as he was. No one had spoken and the Reverend nodded. \"Elsa… I vow to always love, care, respect, and to always keep you in my life. You are the most beautiful, most brilliant, most amazing woman I've ever met; I will never let you go or abandon you. My love for you has done nothing but grow over the years we spent together, it will never ever be broken. I love you, Elsa and I always will.\" Tears of joy formed in Elsa's eyes, very pleased with what she had just heard. The guests smiled, but only the girls were crying with joy. After a few moments of silence, the priest turned to Elsa and said, \"Now you…\" Elsa gazed at her groom, still smiling through her tears. \"Victor… you are such a wonderful man. You've been there for me since the beginning and I promise everything that you've just said to me, I will do the same for you. I vow to care and love you, no matter what. If we ever end up in a fight, just remember that I will never wish to leave you, but to grow closer to you in any way there is; I love you, Victor, always and forever.\" More tears and sniffs were heard from the female guests, watching the beautiful sight in front of them all. \"Now Victor…\" The priest said. \"Do you take Elsa to be your wife, to have and to hold, until death do you part?\" \"I do.\" Victor replied. The priest nodded and turned to Elsa. \"And do you, Elsa, take Victor to be your husband, to have and to hold, until death do you part?\" \"I do.\" Elsa replied. They exchanged rings before Reverend Campbell announced, \"Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.\" The young couple embraced in a long, sweet kiss. The crowd cheered loudly before the bride and groom walked up the aisle, out the church, past the guests showering them with flower petals, and into the limo that would take them straight to the reception. At the reception, Victor and Elsa not only had cake and danced the night away, they reconnected with old friends from their childhood. Bob had opened his own restaurant with Jenny, Toshiaki and Nassor are training to become science teachers with Hillary and Mae-Lee, Mindy had become a psychoanalyst and was in the process of writing a book on dream interpretation, and Edgar had gotten a job as a grave digger in the local cemetery. After a few minutes of dancing, Victor and Elsa sat down. It was then that they were approached by a familiar face. \"Mr. Rzykruski?!\" They exclaimed. \"Hello, you lovebirds.\" Mr. Rzykruski said with a smile. \"You were invited?\" Elsa asked. \"Of course I was, Elsa. Your mother made up the guest list. And besides, I wouldn't miss this for the world.\" He said as he gave his former students a hug. \"So, what have you been doing with yourself, sir?\" Victor asked. \"Well, I've been working as a science exhibit curator at the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh for the past several years.\" He replied. \"In Pennsylvania?\" Elsa asked; he nodded. \"Wow, that's amazing.\" \"Thank you. I just wanted to stop by and give my congratulations… And between you and me, I always knew you two would end up together.\" Mr. Rzykruski said in a conspiring whisper, which made Victor and Elsa blush and smile at each other. \"Thanks.\" They laughed. \"You're welcome. And good luck to you both.\" Mr. Rzykruski said warmly. All too soon, the celebrations wound down. Victor and Elsa headed for the limo that would take them to the airport, and from there, their honeymoon destination in Boston Massachusetts. Closing her eyes and smiling widely, Elsa hurled her bouquet into the air over her shoulder. All of the single ladies wrestled to catch it, only for the flowers to fly right over their heads and land in the hands of Mindy. She looked at Edgar, who was looking at her with a hopeful, dopey grin on his face. \"Wow, Mindy.\" He said nervously. \"Looks like you're going to be the next bride, and that reminds me. There's something I've been meaning to ask you.\" Mindy blushed and smiled to herself with wide eyes. \"Enjoy your honeymoon, Elsa.\" Jonathon told his little daughter. \"And Victor? Take care of her.\" \"You can count on me, sir.\" Victor nodded. \"Congratulations, sweetheart.\" Lydia beamed. \"I always hoped you would one day feel the joy I feel.\" \"And now, I will.\" Elsa grinned. \"Every day, for the rest of my life.\" \"Congratulations, you two.\" Edward said. \"I've never been so happy.\" Susan cried. Victor and Elsa hugged their parents and smiled. And on that heartfelt note, they climbed into the waiting limo. They waved to their friends and families, who enthusiastically waved back. The crowd cheered and waved after it, until it vanished down the road. Inside, Victor and Elsa were snuggled up together, exhausted from their big day. \"Whew, what a day.\" Victor sighed. \"Victor? Thank you so much for giving me the greatest day of my life.\" Elsa beamed as she wrapped her arms around him in a hug. He wrapped an arm around her shoulder and kissed her cheek before saying, \"And now comes the honeymoon. Just you and me, husband and wife, in nice, quiet Massachusetts.\" \"Can't wait.\" Elsa nuzzled him. \"Love you.\" \"Love you too.\" They cuddled each other happily. Their big day had gone by without a hitch, and tomorrow would be their first full day as Victor and Elsa Frankenstein. Now they had the rest of their lives to look forward to, together.[Chapter 18] After a nice quiet stay in Boston, where they took romantic strolls through at the local parks during the day, and cuddled in their room at night, Victor and Elsa returned home as husband and wife. When they returned, they earned enough money at their jobs and bought a beautiful two-story house, perfect to start a family. The young couple began their new life together; Victor working at a local science lab and selling a few of his inventions and Elsa working as an archivist for the New Holland Historical Society. A few months had passed since they moved into their new home and lately, Elsa had started to feel very strange. She felt it difficult to stay awake at times especially during the day, she's been feeling unnaturally dizzy, and she could hardly keep her food down, nearly throwing up after every meal almost every single day. One morning, Elsa and Victor were still in bed when she woke up with a familiar sickening feeling in her stomach; she felt like she was going to throw up. She sat up, only for Victor to begrudgingly wake up. \"Els? Is everything okay?\" He asked, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. \"Uh… it's nothing.\" She lied as she proceeded to get out of bed. \"Elsa, this is been going on for the past few weeks; it clearly isn't 'nothing'. Come on, what's wrong?\" Victor said, turning to see Elsa head towards the bathroom with a hand to her stomach. \"Sorry… I'm just… really not feeling well. I'll be right back, just gimme a minute.\" She replied before closing the bathroom door. In bed, Victor could faintly hear a gagging and haggard coughing soon afterwards; his wife was vomiting again. 'Not again…' He thought. At this point, Elsa felt so miserable and fed up that she finally decided that she had enough. She wanted to know what was going on with her, so she booked an appointment with the local physician, Dr. Karen Rodney, to get to the root of the problem. Later that day, Victor was in the living room reading a book when his wife came home. When he looked up from his book, he saw that Elsa's eyes were pretty wide, as if she was given news. Either exciting or terrible, he didn't know. \"Els? What'd the doctor say?\" He asked, putting the book down. \"No… nothing's wrong. I just… I have something important to tell you.\" Elsa replied nervously. Victor gestured for Elsa to sit down next to him and tell him everything Dr. Rodney had told her earlier that day; she sat down next to her husband and put a hand on her abdomen. \"Is everything okay, hon?\" Victor asked; she didn't respond, causing him to reach out and take her hand. \"Elsa, what's wrong?\" \"I have news.\" She said bluntly. \"What kind of news?\" \"Victor… how many kids would you like to have?\" This sudden question surprised Victor; he hadn't really thought about that until now. \"I don't know, one… maybe, two or three. Why do you ask?\" He replied. \"Good.\" Elsa grinned at that answer; she leaned closer to her husband's ear. \"Because I'm pregnant .\" Victor's eyes widened and his jaw dropped as he looked at his wife. \"Is… this true?\" He asked; she nodded. \"Yes, I'm having a baby.\" She said, her excited grin still plastered on her face. Victor blinked a few times before he wrapped his arms around her in a smothering hug and started to burst into laughter. Elsa laughed along with him as she hugged him back. \"Oh my gosh, we're gonna be parents! This is fantastic!\" He cheered. \"You really think so?\" Elsa asked. \"Absolutely! Wow.\" Victor gave her a small peck on the cheek, earning him a dazzling smile. \"Victor? …Between you and me, I just hope I'm ready to be a mother.\" Elsa said. \"Are you kidding me? You'll be a great mother.\" Victor assured. \"You're caring, kind, considerate, and fair… all the makings of a great mom.\" \"Being parents is a pretty big responsibility.\" Elsa noted. \"You really think we'll be up for it?\" \"Absolutely. You and I are hardworking, smart, and dependable.\" He reminded her. \"I'm sure the two of us will be just fine.\" \"Hmmmm… yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks, Vic.\" \"Of course, Els. Love you.\" \"Love you, too.\" Victor pulled Elsa closer to him as they sat together on the sofa; Victor wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulder. \"So… how long?\" He asked. \"According to Dr. Rodney, five weeks I think.\" Elsa replied. \"So the baby should be here by… the end of year?\" \"Probably.\" \"…We need to tell our parents.\" \"You're right. But… how should we tell them?\" \"Leave it to me, hon.\" He smiled at her and kissed her cheek; she smiled back. 0-0-0-0-0-0 A week went by since Elsa had told Victor the news. They decided to tell their parents in person, so they called them and asked them to come over. When they arrived, Edward, Susan, Jonathon, and Lydia were all rather confused. \"Thanks for coming over on such short notice, you guys.\" Victor said politely. \"No problem, son. Now what's going on?\" Edward asked. \"Yes, dear. Is something wrong?\" Susan added. \"Or is there any special reason you called us?\" Jonathon asked. \"Yes. And nothing is wrong. Victor and I have some pretty big news to share.\" Elsa replied. \" Big news? Oooh, do tell.\" Lydia inquired with a smile. Elsa looked at Victor with a smile; they nodded their heads at each other before looking back at their parents and saying, \"We're having a baby.\" The room quickly went quiet; Edward, Susan, Jonathon, and Lydia stared at the couple with wide eyes. Finally, after a few moments of silence, Susan let out a deep gasp and stood up. \"A baby?! Oh, how wonderful!\" She gushed, giving her daughter-in-law a big hug. \"This is amazing! Congratulations!\" Edward cheered. \"Wow, you're gonna be parents! This is great!\" Jonathon exclaimed. \"Oh my goodness!\" Lydia beamed as she went to give her son-in-law a hug. \"I can't wait to see your foal.\" Susan cooed. \"Me, neither.\" Jonathon grinned at Elsa. \"Way to go, my little voodoo doll. Or should we call you 'mom-to-be' from now on?\" \"Very funny, dad.\" Elsa shook her head. \"…I just wish I felt more ready for this. Can we really be good parents?\" \"Are you kidding?\" Edward asked. \"You two will be fantastic parents! Any kid would be lucky to have you!\" \"Edward's right.\" Lydia agreed. \"You're both intelligent, and considerate, and you know how to watch out for others. You'll be a wonderful mother, Elsa; I just know it.\" \"That's what I said.\" Victor recalled. \"Great minds think alike.\" Lydia smirked. \"Besides, you'll have all of us to help.\" Susan added. \"Really?\" Elsa smiled. \"No doubt.\" Jonathon nodded. \"Just try and keep me away from that sure-to-be adorable bundle of cuteness!\" Lydia squealed. \"Thanks, you guys.\" Elsa chuckled, feeling better already. \"Yeah, thanks.\" Victor added with a confident smile. The six of them shared a hug.[Chapter 19] And so it began. The first couple of months were pretty uneventful, except for the morning sickness. But that eventually faded, much to Elsa's relief. She also started to wear rather baggy clothes, just so it wouldn't feel so tight around her stomach. By the third month, Elsa's first ultrasound appointment came around. That night, Victor and Elsa were sitting in bed, gazing at the image of their baby given to them by Dr. Rodney. \"Wow, would you look at that…\" Victor lamented. \"I still hardly believe it.\" Elsa replied. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\" He cooed. \"Gorgeous.\" She snuggled against her husband. \"Not to brag or anything, but were you expecting anything less ?\" \"No way.\" Victor wrapped his arms around her in a hug. Then, Elsa thought of something. \"Victor? Which are you hoping for?\" She asked as she set the pictures on the nightstand. \"Hoping for? What do you mean?\" Victor asked, raising an eyebrow. \"I mean, what are you really expecting the baby to be? A girl or a boy?\" \"Oh, well… I have no idea, honestly. Besides, Dr. Rodney said it's too early to tell. But I don't think the gender really matters to me; I just want the baby to be healthy.\" Elsa put a hand on her abdomen and smiled. \"Yeah, me too.\" She replied, looking at Victor lovingly. Victor pulled his wife closer to him and kissed the side of her head before saying, \"But I suppose we'll just have to be surprised, huh?\" He put a hand on Elsa's before she kissed his cheek. \"Yeah, I guess so. Goodnight. Love you, Vic.\" She said, snuggling back into bad. \"Love you too, Els.\" He replied before shutting off the lights. 0-0-0-0-0-0 As more time passed, Elsa's stomach grew larger, due to the little one growing inside her. Victor responded by doing practically everything for her, and insisting she stay off her feet. The attention was flattering at first, but it soon grew rather tiresome. Eventually, she had enough. \"Here, let me get a cushion, along with your tea.\" Victor offered one day. \"Honey, enough!\" Elsa groaned. \"I may be pregnant, but I'm not helpless!\" To emphasize her point, Elsa got up, walked to the kitchen, grabbed her tea and the cushion, and sat back down, leaving her would-be caretaker with a very sheepish look on his face. \"Sorry, hon.\" Victor rubbed the back of his neck. \"I was only trying to help…\" \"I know, and it was sweet of you to try.\" Elsa smiled. \"But I don't need you to do everything for me. A little extra girth won't slow me down.\" \"That's my Elsa.\" Victor beamed. \"She never gives up.\" Elsa chuckled as her husband went over and gave her a hug, followed by a playful peck on the nose. By the fifth month, Mindy, Jenny, Hillary, Mae-Lee, Susan, and Lydia had put together a surprise baby shower for Elsa. She sat in a comfortable armchair as she unwrapped the presents given to her. \"Open mine first, Elsa!\" Jenny exclaimed, placing a gift wrapped in yellow in her friend's lap. \"Okay, okay.\" She giggled. Elsa unwrapped the gift and opened the box to reveal an adorable stuffed teddy dear with button eyes and a small checkered green and purple quilt. She took it out of the box and smiled at Jenny. \"I saw it in the shop a few days ago and I just figured you'd use it.\" Jenny beamed. \"And I made the quilt myself.\" \"They're perfect; I'm sure the baby will love both. Thanks, Jen.\" Elsa smiled at her friend. \"Now for my gift.\" Mae-Lee said, offering Elsa a box wrapped in red. Inside, there were eight sets of baby-sized footie-pajamas in red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple, and even pink. \"I didn't know whether your child was going to be a boy or a girl, so I made them in every color of the rainbow. I hope you don't mind.\" Mae-Lee casually said. \"Don't mind? They're beautiful, Mae. Thank you so much.\" Elsa beamed. She opened Hillary's gift next: a lovely silver metal rattle, which she explained was hers as a baby. \"Wow Hill, this was really yours?\" Elsa asked. \"Indeed it was. Now I want you to have it, my friend.\" Hillary replied. Mindy's gift was an illustrated book of fairy tales and other fables and a record of all kinds of lullabies. \"Now it's our turn.\" Susan said as she and Lydia pulled a box with purple and green wrapping. Elsa took the box and what she saw made her gasp; it was a beautiful mobile with bats, little lightning bolts, and even dogs that resembled Sparky, Persephone and their pups. Her eyes filled up with tears as she looked at Lydia and Susan. \"I love it!\" She exclaimed, hugging her mother and her mother-in-law tightly. \"Thank you so, so, SO much!\" \"You're welcome, sweetheart.\" Lydia beamed. \"We put it together ourselves, with a little help from the boys.\" Susan said with a giggle. \"Thank you so much, girls! These gifts are wonderful.\" Elsa cried. \"Oh, we're not done yet.\" Mae-Lee declared. \"We all pitched in on this one.\" Jenny went upstairs, followed by Mae-Lee. They returned with a wooden crib painted blue and decorated with black roses on the side. The cushion was feathered and the laced pillow was made of silk. Elsa was about to cry. \"Oh my gosh, you girls are the best!\" She declared. \"And I know the baby is going to have the best aunts and grandmothers in the world.\" They all moved in for a group hug. Later that night, Elsa lamented all about the baby shower. \"Wow.\" Victor said, looking at the crib in the corner. \"They really made that?\" \"Yeah, isn't it beautiful?\" Elsa asked. \"Absolutely. The baby is gonna love it, along with the mobile.\" Elsa let out a contented sigh before she laid back into bed with Victor right beside her. \"Sweet dreams.\" She whispered. \"You too.\" He hummed, giving her a kiss and turning off the light. 0-0-0-0-0-0 The New Holland Windmill was on fire and Elsa was hanging on to it, just like on Dutch Day all those years ago. Victor had finally reached the top. \" Victor, help me!\" She cried. \" Hang on, don't let go!\" Victor yelled as he tried to grab her hand. \" I can't reach!\" Mr. Whiskers the vampire bat cat suddenly attacked Victor, knocking him over. He pushed the monster off of him and it flew in a different direction before he tried to think of something to save his wife. \" Hold on!\" \" I'm losing my grip; I can't hold on for much longer!\" Victor grabbed a rope and threw it down just as Elsa's grip had finally failed. She fell, but grabbed the rope just in time… only to be flung right at Mr. Whiskers, who hissed hungrily at her. She screamed. \" ELSA! NO!\" 0-0-0-0-0-0 \"ELSA! NO!\" Victor screamed. He jumped up in bed in a cold sweat. He was breathing heavy, terrified for his life… or their lives. Victor looked to his right; Elsa was alive and well. She rubbed her eyes and looked over at her startled husband. \"Victor? Are… are you okay? What's going on?\" She asked, looking for a clock; it was 3:47 in the morning. She yawned and turned on her lamp. \"Sorry, Els… I-I didn't mean to wake you but…\" Before Elsa could respond, Victor tackled her. He kissed her all over her face and stomach, hugging her tightly. As his face rubbed against her clothes, Elsa felt her night shirt becoming wet. She looked down curiously and she was slightly shocked by what she saw. Victor was crying! \"Victor?\" He looked up, sniffling. His eyes were, indeed, red and tears were streaming down his pale cheeks. Elsa wiped his face; she had never seen her husband so shaken up. \"What happened? Are you okay?\" She asked. Victor was glad he had Elsa because he knew she would never judge him. She knew if someone like him was crying, something was definitely wrong. \"N-nightmare… you-you and the baby…\" He whimpered. Elsa rubbed his back, trying to relax him. \"What about me and the baby?\" He gripped into her impregnated belly. \"You… you fell off the burning windmill… and Mindy's old cat killed you!\" \"Shh, shh… it's okay. It's okay.\" She rubbed his cheek, kissing his forehead. She tried to be as comforting as possible. \"B-but I thought I lost you! And our baby!\" He continued. Elsa felt tears stinging at her eyes; she had never seen her husband so scared and so sad before. She laid several kissed on top of his head, nuzzling his mane. \"No. You didn't lose us. I'm alive and so is the baby. Here, listen to it.\" She gestured to her belly which Victor was using, gently, as a pillow. His eyes widened as he quieted down. \"I… I hear something.\" He whispered. Elsa giggled as her husband's hands moved all over her belly, starting to tickle. His saddened expression was quickly replaced as he acted like a kid on Christmas Day. \"See. We're all fine.\" Victor rose back up to his original position. Elsa kissed him on the nose before settling down with the pillow. Victor dragged the blankets up to them; he leaned over to her ear and whispered, \"Well… just to be safe.\" He placed a protective hand on her belly, making sure nothing would hurt her again; in dreams or reality. They snuggled back into bed and shared another kiss before Elsa turned the light off.[Chapter 20] As the ninth and final month rolled around, Elsa was bigger than ever, but she insisted on staying active. It was the Winter Solstice and she and Victor had just finished their walk through the neighborhood that very morning. They stood at the door as they were just about to take off their winter coats. \"Do my ankles look fat to you?\" Elsa asked. \"No way.\" Victor replied, shaking his head. She gave him a look that screamed, 'Tell me the truth.' \"What? I am.\" He admitted. \"You wanted me to tell you the truth.\" \"Hey, I'm only kidding.\" She giggled. \"I was just—\" Suddenly, Elsa felt a sharp pain in her stomach. She let out a cry and clutched her stomach with both hands. Victor put a hand on her shoulder and looked at her with a concerned look. \"Honey, what is it? What's wrong?\" He worriedly asked. \"It… it's the baby. I think it's coming!\" Elsa wheezed. \"The baby?! Right NOW?! It's a little early, isn't it?\" Victor cried. \"Tell that to the baby, why don't you?\" Elsa retorted, before leaning against the wall in pain. \"Aagh!\" \"Okay, okay, don't panic!\" He said, panicked. \"We've got this. We know what to do, right?\" \"Right.\" Elsa replied as she picked up the phone to call her parents. After the call was made, Victor carefully took Elsa to the car, started it, and took off in the direction of the hospital. When they got there, they barreled through the doors and to the front desk. \"Get Dr. Rodney, now!\" Victor yelled. \"My wife is about to have our baby!\" \"I'll let her know right away.\" The elderly nurse nodded, before dashing off down the corridor. Victor eased Elsa onto a chair. \"Easy, now.\" He rubbed her shoulder. \"Everything's gonna be fine.\" \"Don't patronize me.\" Elsa said through gritted teeth; her breathing staggered. \"I know perfectly well what may or may not happen, so don't think a half-hearted reassurance is gonna help.\" Victor gulped and said nothing. Before long, Dr. Rodney, followed by the same nurse with a wheelchair, arrived. \"This way, please.\" She noted. Victor helped his wife into the chair, and they took her to the birthing room. As Elsa lay on the bed, in total agony, Victor held her hand. \"It hurts…\" Elsa cringed. \"It hurts… so much…\" \"Easy, now.\" Victor said. \"Just remember your breathing.\" \"Right.\" She whispered, looking at her husband worriedly. At the same time, she held onto his hand. \"Victor, I'm so scared. I'm not sure I could—\" \"Don't worry.\" He stroked her hair. \"You'll get through this. I know it.\" \"Okay, Mrs. Frankenstein.\" Dr. Rodney interjected. \"Just relax and everything will be alright.\" After an hour or so of intense agony, Elsa's pain finally ceased, as the cries of a newborn baby filled the room. \"Congratulations.\" Dr. Rodney smiled. \"It's a boy.\" Victor and Elsa sighed in relief. The baby was wrapped in a swaddling pale blue cloth and placed in Elsa's arms. He looked like a perfect mix of both of his parents; black hair, fair skin, and big dark eyes. \"He's so beautiful.\" Elsa sighed. \"He sure is.\" Victor smiled. \"Way to go, Els. You did great.\" The baby boy shifted slightly in his mother's arms and cooed softly. Not long after, Edward, Susan, Jonathon, Lydia, and even Mayor Bergermeister came in. \"Congratulations, you two.\" Susan smiled. \"What a strapping little fellow.\" The Mayor commented. \"Wow, he looks just like his father.\" Edward beamed. \"He is so cute!\" Lydia squealed. \"I could just eat him up!\" \"Great job, Elsa.\" Jonathon grinned. \"You too, Victor.\" \"Thanks, dad.\" Elsa chuckled. \"So, what are you going to call him?\" Edward asked. \"We've talked about it for a while now.\" Victor admitted. \"Threw a few names out… but there's one name we both agreed on giving our baby if it was a boy.\" \"And what is it?\" Lydia asked. \"Peter.\" Elsa smiled at the boy. \"Peter Timothy Frankenstein.\" \"The perfect name.\" Mr. Bergermeister nodded. \"Welcome to New Holland, Peter Frankenstein.\"[Chapter 21] By the time Peter was two years old, he was already full of boundless energy and infinite curiosity; he would race around the house, examining whatever caught his fancy. One morning, Peter was attempting to discover what was under the sofa when Victor pulled him out. \"Not so fast, little explorer.\" He chuckled. \"Awwww, no fair!\" The little boy groaned. Victor took Peter over to his mother, who was sitting at the kitchen table. \"There's my little prince.\" Elsa smiled, kissing her son's nose. \"Peter, daddy and I will be gone for a little while. But don't worry; your grandma and grandpa will be taking care of you until we come back.\" \"Yay!\" Peter cheered. Then as if on cue, there was a knock at the door. Victor answered it and there were Edward and Susan standing in the doorway. \"There's my little grandson!\" Susan exclaimed, taking Peter out of Victor's arms and giving him a kiss on the cheek. \"Hi, grandma! Hi, grandpa!\" Peter cheered before Susan put him down. \"Thanks for coming over you guys.\" Victor said as Elsa got up from the table and met him at the door. \"Are you two absolutely sure you can do this?\" Elsa asked. \"Of course.\" Edward said confidently. \"Wouldn't have agreed to it if we couldn't. Piece of cake.\" \"Yes, dear.\" Susan added as she and Edward entered the house. \"Go on, have fun. Everything will be fine.\" \"Okay, if you say so.\" Victor said as he grabbed his overcoat and put it on. \"But remember, don't let him near any electrical sockets, don't let him open any cabinets he's not supposed to go near, and don't forget that if he gets fussy, just give him his special blanky and he'll calm right down.\" \"No problem. And have no fear; grandma and grandpa have everything under control.\" Edward replied with a nod. \"That's that settled then.\" Victor smiled. \"We're off.\" \"One word of advice.\" Elsa added as she wrapped her scarf around her neck. \"Don't take your eyes off of peter. Not for a moment.\" \"Can do.\" Edward saluted. \"Of course.\" Susan added. Victor and Elsa each gave Peter a kiss before waving goodbye and heading out the door. As the door closed, Edward was feeling confident in his babysitting abilities. \"Like I said, this is going to be a piece of cake.\" He smirked. \"Right, honey?\" \"Yep. What do you think, Peter?\" Susan asked. Turning around, Susan realized Peter was gone. \"Oh dear. Where'd you go?\" She looked around frantically. \"Over here!\" Peter called, having climbed up onto the sofa. \"Watch me jump!\" \"No!\" Edward yelped. Peter began to jump and jump on the sofa's cushion until he slipped. Edward made to catch him, throwing his hands up, but Peter ending up landing on his stomach. \"Whee!\" Peter giggled. \"Fun!\" \"Yeah, real fun…\" Edward groaned. Peter turned his attention to the kitchen, got up, and cried, \"Hungry!\" \"Hey, wait!\" Edward called. \"Sweetie, hold on!\" Susan added. Peter climbed off of his grandfather and rushed into the kitchen. Suddenly, his eye was caught by a box up on top of the fridge; it was slightly ajar. \"Ooh, cookies…\" He drooled. \"Grandma get them?\" \"Sorry honey, but you know the rules.\" Susan said. \"No sweets before lunchtime.\" Peter pouted before he got an idea. \"I get them.\" He announced as he made his way to the counter. \"Oh no you don't!\" Edward said as he went to pick up the little boy. Peter struggled to get free from his grandfather's grasp and eventually, he made his way onto the counter and walked over to where the fridge was standing… much to the fright of Susan. She tried to grab him again, but it was too late. Peter reached up to grab the box of cookies, only for the box to slip out of his tiny hands and cookies to fly all over the room and turning into nothing but crumbs when they made contact with the kitchen floor. \"Victor and Elsa are gonna kill us for this.\" Susan groaned. \"I sorry, grandpa and grandma.\" Peter said remorsefully. \"You should be.\" Edward said harshly. As the little boy shrank before his grandfather's anger, Edward softened. \"But I oughta be, too. I thought this would be a breeze. Boy, was I wrong. I guess we're just a little out of practice; it's been over twenty years since we last did this sort of thing, after all. We couldn't keep up with you, and we couldn't even stop… all of this.\" \"We're so sorry, dear.\" Susan lamented. \"We must be the worst babysitters ever.\" \"No.\" Peter shook his head. \"Grandpa and grandma good babysitters.\" \"Thanks, sweetie.\" Susan smiled. \"Hey, there's still some time before Elsa and Victor come back. We might be able to clean up this mess.\" \"I help?\" Peter asked. \"Well…\" Susan said, sounding unsure. In response, Peter gave her the puppy-dog eyes treatment. \"Okay. You can help a little.\" \"Yay!\" Peter cheered. \"Let's get to work.\" Edward smiled. Together, they returned to the kitchen and started cleaning up. Edward and Susan did most of the work, but Peter was able to help by holding the dust pan. Eventually, the kitchen was returned to its original state. \"Great work, kiddo.\" Edward smiled. Peter beamed. \"Now, let's get back to the front room before your mommy and daddy get back.\" Susan declared. The trio dashed out of the kitchen and leapt onto the couch. A few moments later, the front door opened, and Victor and Elsa walked in. \"Mama!\" Peter squealed, jumping off the couch and racing to meet them. \"Dada!\" \"Hey, kiddo!\" Victor smiled, picking up his son. \"We missed you too.\" \"Did you have fun with grandma and grandpa?\" Twilight asked. \"Yeah!\" Peter cheered. \"Good babysitters!\" A yawn suddenly escaped his mouth. \"Tired…\" He mumbled. \"Time for your nap, sweetheart.\" Elsa whispered. Peter was taken upstairs and placed in his bed. \"Sleep tight, champ.\" Victor whispered. As they left the room, Elsa turned to Susan and Edward as they were about to grab their coats from the coat rack by the door. \"I hope Peter wasn't too much trouble for you.\" She smiled. \"Oh, no.\" Edward fibbed. \"He was a perfect little angel.\" \"Well in that case, maybe we should have you sit for us more often.\" Victor grinned. \"What do you say?\" \"Yeah, sure…\" Susan gulped. \"Now, if nobody minds, I think I'm going to go right home and take a hot bath.\" \"Me too.\" Edward added. Edward and Susan dashed out the door. Victor and Elsa looked at each in bemusement, then shrugged as they closed the door. Back in his little bed, Peter enjoyed a calm, peaceful sleep, the fun he had with his grandma and grandpa still fresh in his mind.[Chapter 22] During the summer months, a three-year-old Peter had noticed that there was something off about his parents recently. They were holding hushed discussions behind closed doors. One morning, he was sitting on the floor playing with a racecar when he noticed Elsa about to leave the house. \"Where are you going, mommy?\" Peter asked. \"Oh, just to the clinic.\" Elsa said shiftily, grabbing the car keys. \"I have to get my regular check-up from Dr. Rodney. See you soon. Love you!\" And with that Elsa dashed out, shutting the door behind her. \"Okay…\" Peter shrugged as he heard the car start and drive off. \"Well, look at this.\" Victor smiled, kneeling beside his son. \"It's just you and me here today. Wanna go outside and play catch, kiddo?\" \"Would I!\" Peter chuckled, standing up. After a bracing session of fun in the front yard, Peter and Victor went back indoors. An hour later, Elsa returned home. \"Victor?\" She pointed toward the kitchen. \"A word?\" \"Sure, honey.\" Victor nodded. The two went into the kitchen. There were hushed whispers, then a gasp of surprise from Victor followed by a whoop of glee. He and Elsa came back into the main room, wearing large smiles. He could also see his mother crying and he gasped in fright. \"Mommy? Daddy? What's wrong?\" Peter asked nervously. \"Peter… nothing is wrong. We're just very happy.\" Victor told his son. \"About what?\" The boy asked, stumped. \"Honey, we have great news.\" Elsa added. \"What is it?\" Peter asked again. Elsa then picked up her son and gently placed him onto the sofa; she and Victor sat down on either side of him with the grins still adorning their faces. \"What's going on?\" Peter asked worriedly. \"Peter… we're having a baby.\" Elsa announced. \"W-what?\" Peter stuttered, his eyes wide with shock. \"That's right, kiddo. You're going to be a big brother.\" Victor beamed, nodding his head. Peter couldn't believe what he was hearing; he had always wanted to have a little brother or sister, but he didn't expect to have one so soon. Suddenly, his look of shock and disbelief faded into a look of pure excitement and wonder. He stood up and jumped for joy on the sofa as he laughed. \"You're pretty thrilled about this, huh?\" Elsa giggled. Peter didn't answer; he just continued to laugh, jump for joy, and even run around the room a little bit. \"I'll take that as a 'yes'.\" Victor chuckled, wrapping an arm around his wife's shoulder. Peter looked and quickly jumped back onto the couch, joining in on the embrace. He looked up at Elsa, who was smiling down at him. \"When will the baby be here? Today? My next birthday? Christmas ?!\" He asked excitedly. \"Sorry kiddo, but no.\" Victor replied. \"The baby will probably be here sometime next spring.\" \"Awww.\" Peter sighed, sounding disappointed. \"… but where is the baby?\" \"It's on its way, honey.\" Elsa said, pulling her son close. \"You'll need to be patient, but don't worry. After waiting, it'll be worth it in the end. You'll see.\" Peter grinned and wrapped his arms around his mother's waist in a hug; Elsa smiled and ruffled his hair before giving him a kiss on the forehead. She looked at Victor who smiled back at her. In a matter of months, they were going to be a family of four.[Chapter 23] Over time, Victor and Elsa seemed to be busier than ever, preparing the house for the soon-to-be newcomer to their home. During this time, Peter would learn everything he needed to know about being a good brother and he often asked Elsa when the baby would be coming; her usual response was 'Soon, sweetie. Soon.' It was Christmas Day and Elsa was due in a matter of months; Peter, now four years old, was more excited than ever before. That night after dinner, she just finished reading her son a bedtime story when he asked her, \"Mommy? Are you okay? How's the baby? Is it not very cramped in your tummy?\" \"Don't worry sweetie, I'm sure the baby is fine.\" Elsa replied as she put tenderly a hand on Peter's head and gently pulled him into his embrace, pressing her son to her belly. Peter smiled and rubbed his mother's round, taut stomach with his tiny hand until he felt something move; he gasped in surprise. \"Oh! What was that?\" He asked. \"It's okay, honey. It was only your little brother or sister, that's all.\" Elsa replied with a giggle. \"I guess it wants to meet its big brother as fast as possible.\" \" I want to meet it too. I wish I could we could meet today.\" \"Everything takes time…'' \"Hey, you two.\" Victor said as he entered the room and sat down on the bed. \"What are you doing?\" \"Just talking about the baby.\" Elsa replied. \"The baby is moving, daddy! Here, feel!\" Peter said as he grabbed his father's hand and placed it on Elsa's belly. Victor smiled as his unborn child moved and shifted; he looked over at his son who was curiously resting his ear on his mother's tummy. \"Son? We know you're excited about the new baby, but you need to remember something. Your mother and I are going to spend a lot of time with the baby.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"But… you must also know that just because there's going to be a new baby here doesn't mean that you're any less important to us. We'll always love you no matter what.\" \"You will?\" \"Always and forever.\" The small family hugged each other tightly before Peter let out a yawn. \"Awww, looks like someone needs a trip to Dreamland.\" Elsa joked as she tucked her son into bed and gave him a kiss on the head. \"Goodnight, honey.\" \"Goodnight, mommy. Goodnight, daddy.\" Peter said before he fell fast asleep. Victor and Elsa smiled, shut off the lights, and exited the room, quietly closing the door behind them. The couple then went to their own room to get ready for bed. \"Hey, Els? Look what I found.\" Victor said as he held up a few pieces of paper stapled together. \"What's this?\" Elsa asked, taking the packet in her hands. \"A list of names for the new baby; both boy and girl. And judging by the messy handwriting in crayon, I'm guessing Peter put this together himself.\" Elsa laughed as she read the list to herself; she laid down in bed as her husband sat beside her. \"Where did Peter find all of these?\" \"I found a book full of names when I discovered this packet. He must've been reading through it while he was making this.\" \"This is so cute! …And these names he found are all… really good. Do you think Peter would like it if we picked one of these names for the baby?\" \"I'm sure he'd love that. Let's see what we have here.\" After reading through the entire list, Victor and Elsa finally decided on perfect names for the baby; one if it was a boy and one if it was a girl. \"I think it's perfect.\" Victor lamented as he and his wife snuggled under the covers. \"Me too. What do you think, baby?\" Elsa asked as she looked down at her round belly. \"Do you like those names?\" A firm kick was the response; Elsa giggled as Victor put a hand on her stomach. \"Nice to see you agree.\" \"Goodnight, Els.\" Victor said as he kissed his wife goodnight. \"Goodnight, Vic.\" Elsa said, kissing her husband back. She shut off the lights and they slowly drifted to sleep. 0-0-0-0-0-0 As the weeks passed, it began to grow warmer; spring was finally in the air and Peter couldn't wait to meet his new little sibling. One day, Peter came home from school only to see Edward and Susan waiting for him; the house was devoid of his parents. \"Grandma? Grandpa? What's going on? Where are mommy and daddy?\" He asked, worriedly looking around the room. \"At the hospital.\" Edward told him. \"Your mommy is having the baby as we speak.\" \"Really?!\" Peter gasped. \"Yes, honey.\" Susan nodded. \"The little one started wanting out not long after lunch. Our job was to wait until you got home, then bring you to the hospital.\" \"So let's go!\" Edward declared, \"Okay.\" Peter nodded as Edward picked him up and led him back outside; Susan followed close behind. By the time the three of them arrived at the hospital, Victor and Elsa were still in their room. Peter anxiously waited for the results right outside the door, pacing the floor as he did so. 'I hope everything's alright in there; I hope mommy's okay.' He thought. Susan put a hand on her grandson's shoulder. \"Peter, honey; don't worry.\" She said. \"Your mommy is going to be okay. If I know her, she's strong and she'll be just fine.\" \"You think so, grandma?\" Peter looked up at his grandmother. \"I know so.\" They shared a hug. That was when the door to the room opened and Victor's head poked out; he looked tired. \"Peter? You can come in now.\" He whispered with a smile. Peter took his father's hand and followed him into the room where his mother rested; Edward and Susan nodded at him before the door closed. Peter looked and he saw an exhausted, disheveled Elsa… and she held a tiny baby in her arms; it was a girl. She had big dark eyes, fair skin, and black hair, just like him. Peter's eyes were wide with wonder as Victor gently picked him up to give him a better look. He stared at the bundle in Elsa's arms; she was so small, so quiet, so innocent and sweet. \"Peter, say hello to your new little sister.\" Elsa whispered. 'Little sister?' The small boy thought. \"Hi. I'm Peter, your big brother.\" Peter murmured to the baby, clinging onto the hospital bed frame. \"What do you think, kiddo?\" Victor asked. \"…She's perfect .\" Peter turned to face his mother. \"What's her name, mommy?\" \"Her name is Moira; Moira Juliet Frankenstein.\" Elsa replied softly, giving her son a tired smile. Peter looked up at his parents, then at his baby sister; he realized that they decided to use the names he picked out. He smiled as little Moira reached out and grasped his finger with her little hand. Peter giggled and smiled; he now had a new little playmate, and he made a promise to always be there for Moira, protect her, and love her no matter what. Victor and Elsa smiled as they looked at their children; they knew things at home would never be the same, but that was okay. As long as they were all together, they could do anything.[Chapter 24]  ","Summary":" \"Victor? Honey, it's time to wake up.\" A familiar voice said sweetly. Victor Frankenstein groaned"}]
