Almost Famous y sus personajes pertenecen a Cameron Crowe. Solo me pertenece la trama y redacción de este fanfic. Notas: Probablemente Crowe no estaría demasiado feliz con esta viñeta (con eso de que es una película ligeramente autobiográfica), sin embargo cuando vi la película por primera vez hace un rato pude sentir fuerte y alto toda esa tensión entre ambos protagonistas. La sentí y el hecho de que la chica los haya querido juntar, Oh, Dios , no pude resistirme a escribir esto. Para las pocas que hayan visto la película y vayan a leer esto, espero que les guste. La Música en mis Venas Las hojas de las partituras volaron por los aires alcanzando todos los rincones de la habitación. De pie en el medio William permaneció con los brazos en alto en la posición que quedaron luego de lanzar los papeles. Los melados ojos permanecieron inexpresivos mientras las partituras caían a su alrededor. Por un momento solo hubo silencio en su mente, antes de que el sonido de los vehículos del exterior le alcanzase devolviendo la realidad al lugar. Los dedos de sus pies volvieron a sentir la suavidad de la esponjosa alfombra, enviando vibraciones de placer por el resto de su cuerpo. Sus párpados se apretaron con fuerza antes de que sus manos vueltas puños se presionaran contra sus ojos. La palidez de su piel parecía brillar con mayor fuerza a la tenue luz del amanecer que se filtraba por la ventana, haciéndole parecer etéreo a contraluz. Grandes manos tocaron el pecho desnudo de William quien dejó caer sus brazos hasta atrapar con ellos los fuertes bíceps del hombre tras él. Su espalda desnuda sintió el calor del pecho del hombre más alto quien hundió su nariz entre los cabellos alborotados del menor. Se mantuvieron en tranquilo silencio por largo rato antes de que la voz fuerte del mayor se impusiese atrayendo más cerca del otro cuerpo. —Si lo que querías era vengarte hubiese sido más eficaz el romper las partituras más que solo lanzarlas ¿no crees? —Pero no sabía si tienes copias de todas. No quisiera destrozar una nueva creación y ser el responsable de privar al mundo de tu música tan solo porque seas un jodido hijo de puta— repuso la voz suave de William mientras ladeaba el rostro para darle espacio al otro. Russell no desperdició la oportunidad y plasmó un beso sobre ese cuello mientras absorbía el suave aroma del muchacho. Del hombre ya, hacía tiempo que había dejado de ser un muchacho, tuvo que recordarse una vez más. —Siempre estás cuidando de mí y de Stillwater, a pesar de todo. —Soy vuestro abogado, es mi deber. Sus ojos se encontraron con la luz del amanecer cegándoles a medias. Sus labios no mostraban sonrisas, pero sus acompasados latidos les indicaban que de nuevo todo estaba en paz entre ellos. Russell sabía que no merecía una disculpa tan sencilla, pero no sería él quien lo pelease. Se besaron suavemente mientras una de las manos de músico caía por el abdomen de William quedándose afirmada justo sobre la cinturilla de su desteñido jean de fin de semana. Los dientes de Russell se cerraron en el labio inferior de su pareja con la presión justa para hacerle soltar un suave gemido derritiéndole entre sus brazos tal como le gustaba. —La gente suele decir que los grandes momentos de la vida real no tienen Banda Sonora como en las películas, pero yo siempre he pensado que ellos se equivocan— murmuró Russell besando el oído de William mientras observaban juntos hacia el sol que se erguía entre los edificios de Nueva York —Siempre que te beso escucho la música en mis venas. A veces William se preguntaba porque Dios le había dado a ese hombre un don tan hermoso junto con una personalidad tan espantosa. Era injusto, pensaba, porque de esa forma nunca podía decirle que no y seguía cayendo en el círculo vicioso que significaba estar enamorado de una estrella como Russell Hammond. Y siempre se quemaba con su luz. Pero qué importaba quemarse si luego sus heridas serían sanadas con besos del hombre al que amaba. FIN Muchas gracias por leer. Por si no se entendió, esta escena ocurriría años después del final de la película. Stillwater consagrada como banda de alto nivel y William siendo ya abogado. Si se preguntan \" ¿Cómo fue que estudió Leyes si su motivación era escribir sobre la música a todas luces? \" pues… yo amo escribir historias y aquí me tienen, estudiando Derecho con dolor, ahaha xD La viñeta trata, como habrán notado, de una reconciliación. Un perdón a una disculpa no pedida. ¿El motivo? Podrían haber tantos motivos por los que Russell podría enfadar a William que prefiero dejar eso a la imaginación de cada uno y no limitarlo por un motivo específico que no desarrollaré. Lo importante es que la música y el amor siguen vivos en sus corazones. Latiendo fuerte en sus venas.

Sadly, being born in 1997, I was not able to experience the awesomeness that was the classic rock era. Ever since I was little, I've been heavily influenced on music by my father, who worked from home, while my mother was always out in some random foreign country for some business meeting. Listening to classic rock bands have inspired my entire lifestyle, from my clothes, to my attitude, to my outlook on life. When someone says the word \"bands,\" I don't think of Sleeping With Sirens or Black Veil Brides, none of that whole genre. I think of Fleetwood Mac, Led Zeppelin, Stillwater, The Doors, Pink Floyd, and so many more. These are the bands that started a whole new generation for the entirety of the music industry. Although this happened so, so long ago, I had the opportunity to experience it in 2015, a year where \"pop music\" dominated the charts. At 18 years old, during the prime of my life, I toured as an undercover groupie, or a \"Bandaid,\" for a classic rock cover band, The Mockingbirds. With them, the youngest member five years older than myself, I discovered more within eight months than the past eight years of my life. This is my story of coming face-to-face with the hardships and good times that go along with the rock and roll life… only in 2015. ","Summary":" 1973 was a year to be alive.

Esa noche ya se termino hace 12 años atrás..pero todos la recordamos como si fuera ayer.. todavía podemos oler el suave olor a café y cigarro.. y ver esa oscuridad inclaudicable con fugases estrellas que nunca mas pudimos ver..Como olvidar ese frió intenso que se manifestaba en las narices rojas.. como olvidarnos de los muchos abrazos que se dieron esa noche.. de las miles de luces multicolores que volaban flotando en el techo con el fin de animar cada alma con sentimientos que estaba ahí.. Todo el mundo o ,bueno, toda la gente que conozco me ha dejado claro que el amor es algo grande..algo que no se da de un día para otro.. y que es reciproco y serio. Pero ¿Qué pasaría si una mañana te das cuenta que el gran amor de tu vida ya no te da día a día razones para amarlo¿y si en una noche con solo ver a alguien..te enamoras? Todo comenzó un julio de 1962.. en plena época hippie.. las flores, las guitarras y el amor se olían en el aire y era muy fácil perderse en las mentiras de otro.. la gente se había vuelto mas ilusa e ingenua.. y la libertad se estaba apoderando del espíritu de todos los jóvenes.. obviamente no todos vivían en ese mundo color amarillo fosforescente..pero aquellos que no estaban conforme con la libertad..se refugiaban en la música .. y no puedo describir esta época sin mencionar las drogas..que también se fueron apoderando lamentablemente, de las mentes de los jóvenes.. El amor, en ese entonces.. era algo que ya no necesitaba compromiso… y nadie estaba en contra de ello.. bueno.. aparentemente nadie.. Podríamos decir que el mundo juvenil estaba en su mejor momento.. todos sus cerebros estaban en una constante danza día a día.. ya no habían problemas.. y si los habían.. podían refugiarse en cualquier cosa para matarlos.. el día no se diferenciaba de la noche y no existían las caras desagradables ni los comentarios fuera de lugar.. ahora parecía que cada persona se conocía desde que eran chicos.. y las calles de habían convertido en una gran casa donde convivían miles y miles de personas sonriendo las 24 horas del día.. A solo dos kilómetros de la calle principal de Treviglio, una pequeña ciudad del sur de Italia, en la cafetería mas antigua del lugar, estaban sentados martín y samanta, dos muchachos de segundo medio del colegio con mejor prestigio de la zona, y por consiguiente, el menos valorado por la juventud hippie que buscaba solo lo mas sencillo. Martín era un muchacho alto, flaco, con verdes ojos intensos y muchas espinillas.. hablaba muy bajo pero siempre mirando a los ojos.. tenia un aire paternal que hacia a samanta volar en sus brazos cada ves que estaba con el.. ella era mas baja y rubia.. con ojos miel y cachetes bien colorados.. era cariñosa y reía siempre.. se conocían desde el jardín y se tenían mucho cariño.. se podría decir que se conocían bastante..o eso era lo que creían saber.. Se habían quedado de encontrar ahí la semana pasada.. era un día martes, a las 7:53 exactamente.. un día soleado pero con arto viento.. pronto se tendrían que ir al colegio. martín quería hablar con ella.. pero de nada importante..solo conversar.. -oye Sammy.. ya quiero salir de vacaciones.. estoy harto de las miles de pruebas.. y los profesores ya me están aburriendo.. – decía Martín mientras tomaba un café helado -ay si.. pero ya queda poco! .. oye.. y que vas a hacer en el verano? Dijo Samanta comiendo pequeñas galletas de chocolate y mirando de reojo al chico. Martín miro a los ojos a samanta y se quedo callado un buen rato.. -heee..voy voy..- balbuceaba sin saber porque se podía tan nervioso.. era como si supiera que una noche del verano todo iba a cambiar entre ellos.. -voy a viajar con mis papas y Camila a Vicenza.. y después capas valla a la playa.. y tu? Samanta sonrió y dijo- ay yo también voy a la playa.. Martín sonrió también.. Samanta pensaba - guauu que lindo se ve a si.. se le hacen pequeños hoyuelos en los cachetes! Que daría yo por tener algo con el..- Y de repente sintió algo dentro de ella que no supo describirlo.. capas ella también se estaba dando cuenta que una de esas noches en la playa algo iba a cambiar.. De repente entraron dos chicos y una chica, los tres abrazados y riéndose a carcajadas.. Un muchacho saco un algo enrollado del bolsillo y se lo empezó a fumar mientras el otro chico con la chica se besaban apasionadamente .. Los tres pidieron un baso de agua y se fueron riéndose muy desagradablemente. -Mmmm no entiendo porque son así.. acaso sus mamas no les enseñaron a comportarse bien frente a su novia y a no fumar marihuana?- Dijo serio martin. Los dos se miraron y samanta creyó que era otro de los consejos paternales de martín..pero antes de que pudiera terminar de pensar..una risa incontrolable se apodero de ella y se rió a carcajadas, casi como los muchachos que recién se habían ido. Martín también se largo a reír y dijo: -no se porque.. nosotros no somos así.. - ai pero..no crees que nuestra vida es mas sana? -si pero.. es así de divertida? -no lo se pero.. por lo menos tenemos valores.. y nuestro colegio es católico.. - si eso es bueno..pero apuesto a que te mueres de ganas de fumar un puro.. -jaja mmm podría ser.. pero Martín! Porque no esperar hasta que semanos mas grandes.. -si puede ser.. por el momento prefiero mi vida como esta ahora.. aunque me digan que mi familia tiene demasiada plata y que podría hacer muchas mas cosas de las que hago ahora.. y q vivo en una burbuja bla bla bla... buaah me da lo mismo.. por lo menos no termino en una clínica todas las semanas y no me olvido quien es mi novia al otro día. Ese si que era un consejo paternal… que hizo volar a samanta.. y le tomo la mano sin pensarlo.. -martín eres taan inteligente.. jejeje .-dijo con una risita tonta - jaja gracias sammy..pero es solo la verdad.. eei estas muy bonita hoy día.. bueno.. vamos al colegio? Se esta haciendo tarde.. -vamos Martín. Pasaron semanas y semanas y el colegio envés de alivianarse con el tiempo, se hacia mas pesado.. los profesores no perdían ninguna oportunidad de estresar a los chicos y por si fuera poco, ya los estaban preparando para el gran examen final de cuarto medio, el F.U.I.C. Todo esto.. a solo dos semanas de salir de clases. Al fin llego el día.. todos se despedían en la salida .. pero sabiendo que seguramente se iban a volver a ver en la playa de Treviglio..lugar donde la mayoría del colegio se refugiaba en el verano.. para huir de todos los jóvenes liberales que les quitaban todos sus sueños de tener un espíritu limpio.. El calor se empezaba a impregnar en los desayunos de todos los días y en los ojos de las quinceañeras que se bañaban en sus piscinas.. el calor achicaba todos los pensamientos.. ensuciaba el agua y decaía las mentes de todos.. agrandaba el pesimismo y las confusiones.. poco a poco el calor se apoderaba de todo ser vivo de Italia..hasta en las ciudades mas frías.. Por eso fue que un día Benjamín y Manuel, los dos mejores amigos de Martín, decidieron organizar unas vacaciones a un lugar frío.. un lugar donde pudieran huir, además de los jóvenes liberales.. del calor insoportable de Treviglio.. y decidieron buscar otro lugar.. un lugar que pronto se convertiría en escenario de unas grandes e inolvidables vacaciones… de una larga noche… -laura! Mañana hay un asado en la casa de Leopoldo.. vamos a celebrar el final del año..quieres venir? - hola Aida.. ya, me encantaría! Voy a ver.. - okay, oye me contaron que no te fue muy bien en los exámenes.. que mal! -mmm la verdad es que me da lo mismo.. por el momento prefiero preocuparme de cosas mas importantes.. como la salud de mi papa que esta cada día peor.. o ayudar a mi hermano a reunir la plata para la universidad el próximo año.. - bueno si, tienes razón, pero no puedes descuidar así como así las notas.. oye por cierto, tu papa no esta bien? - no Aida.. pareciera que los medicamentos no les hacen bien.. - que mal, te deseo lo mejor laura.. ya, te tengo que cortar mi mama me llama para comer.. chao -adiós.. A solo dos cuadras de la iglesia, dentro de una casa de madera muy calurosa, estaba una niña tirada en su cama con ojos llorosos.. acababa de cortar el teléfono después de una conversación con una chica de su colegio.. La pequeña se llamaba laura, su padre tenia cáncer hace tres años y aparentemente, la enfermedad se estaba apoderando de todo.. de el cuerpo de el, de su mente.. de la unión de la familia.. de las notas de la chica.. y la plata iva desapareciendo como si fueran plumas en dos manos.. su hermano, Lorenzo acababa de salir del colegio y quería estudiar medicina, pero el dinero lamentablemente no alcanzaba. Lo que nadie sabia, era que este verano laura iba a cambiar.. capas para bien o para mal.. eso se los dejo q ustedes.. Mientras laura miraba lánguidamente el techo y se limpiaba los ojos debajo de sus lentes con el chaleco .. dos muchachos de su clase estaban organizando unas vacaciones con amigos a un lugar con un clima mas frió que Italia.. habían pensado en Inglaterra, pero no era lo suficientemente frió y seguramente era demasiado caro.. también pensaron en Finlandia pero era muy peligroso.. capas les podía pasar algo.. hasta que llegaron a la conclusión que noruega seria el lugar perfecto. -Noruega… noruegaa.. noruegaaaaaa .. mira mira dilo hartas veces! -Jajaja noruega noruegaaa jajaja - lo vamos a pasar demasiado bieen! -si estoy seguro que si! Que entretenidoo.. ya me quiero ir! - jajajaj… Manuel y benjamín se abrazaban , gritaban y se reían descontroladamente después de haber escuchado de sus padres que si podían ir. En sus cabezas había una gigantesca ilusión que no podían controlar, tenían una fuerza intensa con mucha energía que tenían que expulsar.. se sentían completamente llenos.. solo faltaba el día del viaje.. solo faltaba estar ahí.. ahí con sus amigos y amigas.. ai en la playa con ese frió que seguramente lo iban a sentir las mejillas.. Cuando les contaron a los demás, la primera reacción fue – pero ¿Cómo vamos a huir de el calor? Si estamos en verano.. ¿no es algo raro? Pero a pesar de eso, mientras pasaba el tiempo y las pieles se iban poniendo cada vez mas rojas y los periodistas aconsejaban irse de vacaciones a lugares mas cerca de los polos.. (cosa que nadie hacia porque los hippies amaban el sol), los compañeros de benjamín y Manuel se fueron dando cuenta que no perdían nada yéndose una o dos semanas a un lugar con amigos.. ya que después volverían al calor infernal que no se apagaría hasta noviembre. Samanta , Fabricio, benjamín, Manuel, Agustina, Gianfranco , Laura , Aida, Martin, Raffaella, Giordano, Nicoletta, y Bruno. 13 jóvenes unidos por un solo sueño: pasarlo bien. Porque el tema del calor ya había pasado a tercer plano.. ahora lo mas importante era liberarse de los problemas y unirse mas a sus compañeros para convertir ese verano en un verano inolvidable.. que asi iva a ser.

The article,nseveral pages long, was to commemorate, if even that, the fifteennyear anniversary of the band's breakup, and featured interviewsnwith the three remaining band members and their manager.

Once there was Penny Lane. Dedication: I dedicate this to everyone else whonknows what it is to be a fan. To truly love some silly little piecenof music or some band so much that it hurts. The Wind I listen to the wind, To the wind of my soul, Where I'll end up, well I think Only God really knows You don't know what to do. You don't want tonstay and you don't want to go. Soft musicnis playing in the background as you stare out the window, trying tondecide. You were never any good with decisions. You want it all, even if you know you can't havenit or you don't know what it is you want. Suddenly your friend JoninMitchell is singing just for you and you mouth the words along withnher strong voice, because of course you know them 'Hentried hard to help, you know he put me at ease, and then he loved menso naughty, made me weak in the knees, oh I wish I had a river Incould skate away on'. Countless of times you've heard those words before, but now theynhave colours and meaning and you know what to do. You should go. Dust gets in your vivid green eyes as you pull down the old, batterednbrown guitar case from the darkness of the top shelf of yournwardrobe. It is right that the only light in the room comes from anfew lit candles, for this is sacred. You can feel it as you open thenclasps previously locking the case and pull out a green, velvet coatntrimmed with white fur. Out of the pocket falls a pair of large sunglassesnmade by purple plastic and the from your mother's radio downstairsnthe chords and words of a Beatles song slips through your floorboards 'Penny Lane is in my ears and in myneyes, wet beneath the blue suburban skies, I sit and meanwhile back' you smile a secret smile that still lasts when you head out the frontndoor and even though your mother tells Lady Goodman goodbye, it'snPenny Lane who leaves the simple house. Now the summer has begun. I've sat upon the setting sun, But never, never, never, never, I never wanted water once, No never, never, never, never You'renin and you met, and it's heaven and it's hell. Its bright lightsnand brown eyes. And it's music, becausenmusic is always and it's everywhere. From your hidden spot on thenside of the stage you watch him.

Thengirls that are visible from the stage are simply encouraging, butnyou, invisible and yet noticed, are the true fan that makes themnsomething. I listen to my words, But they fall far below, I let my music take me, Where my heart wants to go And thennyou find out. He wants you to come. Just like last summer. And younremember it, and you want to, but you don't. Back where younstarted, you don't know what to do or where to go. Younwalk home to a home that isn't home, greet your mother that isn'tna mother and lie down in a bed that isn't his. Everything isnconfusing, but everything is simple.

I wished for a Morocco, but it was never real. I always wanted Stillwater more. There was William in Morocco with me, or there was Russell on the road with me. There were exotic new friends or my beloved Band-Aids and my crowd. But now that's all done. I had my fun with Stillwater. Russell and I have moved on. My Band-Aids had split up and followed their own separate bands. And William? What of William? He was the only one I wasn't past. William. William. William. What to say about William? He was polite and sweet. He was intelligent and fun. Interesting, mysterious, and caring. All he ever did was care. That's all his fun with Stillwater ever was. Just him caring about the boys. And about me. Always caring. My birthday. The night of the Quays. The next morning. He was the one who was there. Trying to help me. Trying to keep me safe. He cared. He said he loved me. That was all I remember from the night of the Quays. The next morning I woke up lying on the couch, my head on his lap.

I'm going to lie on the beaches of Essaouira. I'm going to visit the shops of Marrakech. I'm going to ride a camel around and wear exotic clothes and eat exotic foods and… And what? None of that sounded interesting. Lying on beaches alone? Window-shopping on the streets of Marrakech alone? Riding around on a camel alone? Wearing exotic clothes and eating exotic foods alone? No, that was not how it was meant to be. William. We would go together. Just like we had planned once. We would go there together. We would lie in each others arms. We could buy each other things in the shops of Marrakech. We could race each other across the hot sands as fast as we could make our camels go. We would wear exotic clothes and taste exotic foods. Together. Yes, William. We would go. One year. That's how long it's been since I've seen William. Spoken to him. I need him now. We need to go to Morocco. We will. He'll be in school again soon. Perhaps he already is done with school. Is a year too long? Too long for what, Penny? To long for what? For him to still love me? Now that I've finally realized what I feel for him? A year. Damn. Love. Never something I thought I'd feel. Then there was Russell. I wanted him to love me, I wanted to myself. I didn't though. And of course, neither did he. I'm going to Morocco. This weekend. I'll leave in four days. I'm going and I'm going make it all happen. It's all happening. It's all happening… ","Summary":" A/N: So, this is my first Almost Famous story.

Onenshot about the life of a Band Aid She foundnherself by the side of the stage once more, looking out at the mannshe loved. As usual he resided towards the back of the stage, annintegral part of the band, yet shying away from the limelight hisnfellow band mates so enjoyed. It was this shyness that had firstnattracted her, a talented guy, but without the ego of a front man. nShe'd berated herself the night she'd met him. Having gone to angig simply because she loved the band, she'd ended up catching theneye of the singer who'd later sent a roadie down to the front tongive her a pass for the meet and greet later. What had started as ansimply fan greeting, had ended up as an all night party. From meetnto dressing room to pub to tour bus. She'd spoken to them all butnhim… having caught the singer's eye at the gig he'd soon lostninterest when it had become clear she was no groupie, yet his fellownmusician hadn't been able to let her go. A simply hello had becomena talk lasting into the small hours of the morning. When the driverntold the band it was time to head off to the next venue, she hadn'tnbeen able to make herself leave the bus, telling herself she'd justnget a train back home tomorrow. But tomorrow had stretched on fornthree weeks, only arriving with the end of the tour. Tired and poornshe'd kissed him goodbye and headed for home. The nextnfew weeks had been hell. Having returned home to find she'd beennsacked, she'd got a temping job over the Christmas season, but hernmind wouldn't stay on the job, how could it? She'd spent threenweeks on tour with one of her favourite band, falling more and morenfor a man she should never have known. Then had come the phone call.n One tour, one month, twenty three cities around Europe. Forget hernjob, all she had to do was go with them, they'd provide the rest. nShe'd argued with herself for the next week, how could she do it? nGo on tour again, follow him around, forget her life? Her argumentsnhad been futile, by the time the departure date came around she wasnsat in his living room with a packed bag waiting for the bus. Thingsnhad changed when they'd arrived in Germany, she'd found otherngirls there, the hotel room she shared with the roadies wasninvariably shared by others too. Always girls. Always young. Neverngroupies. That's when she'd first heard of Penny Lane. BandnAids they were called. Inspire the group, support the group, nevernsleep with them. She fit in well, she was a perfect Band Aid exceptnfor one small thing. She'd broken the first rule of being a BandnAid before she'd even heard of them. Never fall in love with thenband. Of course she was doing better than Penny Lane had, at leastnher guy was single… Not that it made any difference, he broughtnher on tour, eventually she did sleep with him, she still couldn'tnclass herself as groupie though, there were too many feelingsninvolved, and yet she knew she never had a chance. Not really. Atnthe end of the day, she was never sure how he felt about her, onlynone thing was certain, whatever he felt, it wasn't enough to wantnto be with her. So herenshe was again, one album and two world tours later. Standing by thenside of the stage with Amber, a fellow Band Aid who'd broken thensame rules she had, although she'd gone for the singer. They bothnstood, watching their respective men. A girl in the front row caughtnher attention, a sweet little thing, no more than sixteen. She sawnthe girl throw something on stage. A bracelet. The singer ignorednit and so Amber could relax, but she couldn't. She watched her mannpick it up and slide it over his wrist, raising his hand to his mouthnto blow a kiss at the girl in the audience. A shiver passed throughnher as she watched her man with the unknown child, but it wasn'tnthrough jealousy, she'd given up on that a long time ago, she wasnsimply remembering that first night, when she'd first spoken tonhim, felt her heart race as he asked her name, taken her hand, kissednher… Too many memories, too much pain. Her musician might bensingle, but in the end, she was no better off than Penny Lane. Shenwas still a Band Aid. She was still alone. That's why they werenthere wasn't it? Her, Amber, Penny? They were there, so theyndidn't have to be alone by themselves. So they could convince eachnother this was what they wanted. To stand by the side of the stage. nTo watch the men they loved.

Go find something safer for your delicate constitution. For those of you who like slash, enjoy! Minor spoilers! Setting: The end of the movie where Russell visits William's house and William interviews him. **** \"When did you get so professional again?\" Russell asked with a smile as he leaned over the back of the chair halfway through their interview. William shrugged as he held out the microphone. \"You owe me an interview.\" \"So I do, so I do,\" Russell nodded. \"But do we have to be so serious? I've answered some questions. Let's do something more fun. Less serious.\" \"Not so serious...I can do that,\" William said setting the microphone down but leaving it on. \"How's this for a good not serious question? Have you ever exposed yourself on stage?\" Russell laughed as he looked at the young man before him. \"Have I ever exposed myself on stage? Well, how about this...I'll answer a question for you if you answer a question for me. Deal?\" Russell asked. \"Deal,\" William agreed. \"Alright, once in this little shit hole nightclub I was drunk off my ass and the crowd was rough. So I pulled my jeans down and played with them around my ankles.\" Russell explained. An amused smile spread across William's face. He laughed at the slightly red tint of Russell's face. \"So William,\" Russell said interrupting his amusement. \"Here's my question to you. When was your first kiss?\" William calmed down and thought about it. \"Right after I met you at that first concert. It was Sapphire. She kissed me on the corner of my lip.\" William said touching his lips. \"Just the corner? What about loosing your virginity? Who was that?\" Russell asked with interest. \"Ah, ah, a question for a question. And it's my turn now.\" \"Fine, ask your question, but don't think you're getting out of answering mine.\" Russell replied. \"Okay, what did you want to be in high school? What did you want to grow up to do?\" William asked. \"That's kinda deep. But it could be fun. In school, I always wanted to grow up to be....an ice cream man.\" Russell answered. \"An ice cream man?\" William repeated. \"Yeah, ride around in a truck with all that ice cream. That would be the life. Ok now, so answer my question, who took your virginity?\" \"Ah, I was deflowered by a troupe of crazy 'Band-Aids,'\" William answered. \"Ah, I know who it was!\" Russell said suddenly. \"Yeah, Sapphire said that in any other city in the world, other than Greeneville, I'd still be a virgin,\" William explained. \"Agreed, Greeneville was pretty boring,\" Russell reminded. \"How would you know? You spent the whole time shacked up with Penny!\" William replied a bit resentfully. \"Is that your question? I spent the whole time with Penny cause it was so boring. I was afraid I'd do something I might regret.\" \"Like what?\" William asked interested. \"My turn first. Do you really love Penny?\" William looked at Russell surprised. \"I...well. Yeah, she's beautiful and mysterious and she...well...yeah. I love her. But I guess it's a strange kind of love. Give and take, I'm the give and she's the take.\" William frowned as he looked down at the floor. \"Hey, its alright, she did the same thing to you that I did to her. She gave and I took. Like you said, I used her.\" Russell said reaching out and patting William's leg comfortingly. William looked up at Russell. \"What did you mean when you said you might do something you'd regret in Greeneville?\" Russell blinked as everything turned on him. \"I...well...\" he hesitated, suddenly very nervous. \"Come on, I answered your question, what did you almost do?\" \"I almost went to someone who was off limits. I almost....\" Russell stopped. \"Who Russell? What did you do?\" William prompted leaning forward. \"The interview,\" Russell said looking over William's shoulder. \"The interview is over. I just...answer my question please?\" \"You William. I almost went to you,\" Russell whispered as he focused on William. \"Me? Wha-Why?\" William asked confused. \"Because...well look at you William. You look like an angel. That face, so innocent, and your smile. God those dimples! And just...from the moment we met there was something about you. But I couldn't touch you,\" Russell explained. \"Because of Penny.\" \"No! Because I was afraid. I mean, look at me. I sleep with all these groupies. I've done so much shit in my life and then there you are so, so pure. So real. I couldn't touch you. I didn't want to make you dirty. I didn't want you to become like them. You're more important, more real then they ever were, those stars, those girls, those people. You're always honest and truthful. You never pretend. You're always William, and that's what I love about you. You are William. You are...you are...\" Russell faltered. \"About to kiss you,\" William murmured, finishing the sentence. He leaned forward on the bed. Russell's eyes widened as William's face got closer to his own. He held his breath as William's soft lips touched his. It was everything he'd imagined and more. Despite his initiation of the kiss, William was still shy and hesitant. Russell put his hands up and gently captured William's face. He pressed their mouths together and he used his tongue to gently part William's lips. William opened to him like a flower opens to the sun. Russell allowed his tongue to roam through William's sweet mouth. Just the taste of him was a drug. He was instantly addicted. Slowly and reluctantly he pulled back, releasing William. William sat back on the bed heavily. He stared up at Russell with wide eyes. Russell got off his chair and moved in front of William. William looked up as Russell pushed him back on the bed and settled over him. Russell brushed the hair out of William's eyes with his finger. His fingers ran down William's cheeks caressing the soft skin. His skin was so soft. He was so young and he just didn't realize how bad for him Russell was. Or maybe he did and just didn't care. \"Russell,\" William murmured softly as he leaned into the gentle touch. \"William...I can't,\" Russell sighed. \"Why not? You did it with Penny. I'm not much younger,\" William replied, looking up at Russell with those big trusting eyes. \"It's not that. I just. I don't want to use you like I did to Penny or she did to you. I don't want you to get hurt.\" \"You wouldn't hurt me.\" William said firmly. \"I already have. How do you know it won't happen again?\" Russell asked despairingly. \"Because you're going to be careful. You're going to constantly be asking yourself if you did the right thing. I know you Russell. You won't hurt me.\" William replied taking Russell's hands into his. Russell looked down at their interlaced fingers. \"How can you be so sure?\" \"Because I can, does there need to be a reason? Can't I just believe in you?\" William asked. \"I...you believe in me?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you trust me?\" \"Yes.\" Russell looked thoughtful. \"Can I kiss you again?\" \"Yes.\" **** \"William! Rolling Stone Magazine is on the phone!\" \"Coming!\" William called out. He got off the bed and quickly pulled his shirt back on. He zipped his pants and straightened his hair before rushing out of the room to answer the phone. Russell smiled as he sat up on the rumpled bed. He re-buttoned his shirt and straightened out his hair and beard. Standing up he adjusted his jeans. He was looking through the pictures spread across William's desk when the door opened. He looked up expecting to see William but instead was faced with William's mother. \"Hello Ms. Miller,\" Russell greeted. \"Hello Russell,\" William's mother responded. Her fierce gaze pinned him. \"I know what you were doing,\" she stated. \"Excuse me?\" Russell blinked. \"Don't play dumb with me Mister. I know that you were kissing. I can smell it.\" \"You can?\" Russell asked confused. \"Mother,\" Anita scolded from the doorway. \"Sorry, she does this all the time,\" Anita explained as she tried to lead her mother from the room. \"Anita!\" Elaine protested. \"Leave them alone mother.\" Anita instructed. Russell watched them leave bewildered. Anita turned in the doorway and winked at him. \"Take care of my little brother,\" she ordered before closing the door behind her. Russell sat back on the bed staring at the door. William came back a few minutes late smiling bright enough to outshine the sun. \"Good news?\" \"Yes! Rolling Stone wants me to be an intern reporter. I'll get college credits and will be able to have a full time position with them when I graduate.\" William explained as he shut the door behind him and walked over to the bed. \"I thought your mom wanted you to be a lawyer.\" \"Well I don't want to be a lawyer. I don't like all those rules and laws. But I love Rock n Roll. The music, the bands, the people.\" \"The lead guitarist of Stillwater?\" \"Yeah, I love him too,\" William replied with a smile. \"That's all I need to hear,\" Russell replied as he pulled William to him and kissed him gently.

Note: I decided that despite the lack of Almost Famous fiction on this site (and in general, I believe), my favorite movie needed a tribute. It's been fun fleshing out these characters, and hopefully doing justice to the one who has become iconic. The song is, of course, by Led Zeppelin (because who else is worth listening to?) and every line and chord of it has the mood and the melancholy that I was trying to communicate here.

But it's all Cameron Crowe's. ---- Polexia Aphrodisia \"Act One, in which she pretends she doesn't care about him.\" His fingers are tangled up in her hair, and she isn't like the other girls. For her, it isn't about the music or the sex or the fame or even the excitement. It's just about him. She never meant for any of this to happen. She never even listened to rock 'n' roll; she grew up on her mom's Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra records, and music was never more than background noise to her. For the first few months, she would stare at the other girls up there on the edges of the stage during the concerts or in the \"jam sessions\" in the dingy motel rooms, amazed at the way they closed their eyes ands swayed to the music, drinking it in. But even she has to admit that, after a while, it began to get under her skin, too. She wasn't even supposed to be there that night. But her San Francisco suburb was quiet on Saturday nights, and her best friend Lucy had a huge crush on the guitarist from some midlevel band that was opening for the Guess Who that night. They didn't even attend the concert, just went around to the back of the stadium and Lucy apparently knew the bouncer at the door. Janie (that was her name, back before she was Polexia; she wasn't lucky enough to be born with a name that belongs in this life like Sapphire was) was vaguely disgusted by the whole thing: she had no way of knowing that this scene would play out again and again and come to define her life. There were too many people crammed into the dressing room and there was too much laughter and too much of some sickly sweet smell she wasn't used to and the girls were too made up and the men were too proud of themselves. And she sat scrunched up in a corner on the edge of a counter and watched Lucy laugh far too loudly. And she was just about to grab her purse and leave when she saw him. He was laughing, too, and there was a girl hanging off each of his arms, but his eyes looked…scared. His eyes looked like she felt. Like he wasn't really sure he belonged here, like he wasn't really sure where he belonged, like he wasn't really sure who he was, even though his laugh was a cocky as anyone's. She didn't go home that night. He barely noticed her at first, just like most of the guys never really noticed any of the girls, and she had never been one to draw attention to herself, and after all, she didn't have anything to offer him. She was only sixteen. But she was always, always there, and one day he turned around and he actually saw her, and she knew she would never go home again. She told herself again and again that he didn't love her, that he just loved that she loved him, because he was needy, so terribly needy, as needy as she was. But he would hold her in his lap afterwards, his fingers tangled in her hair, her cheek against his chest as he leaned back against the headboard, and he would talk. She's not even sure if he really knew that he was talking, if he ever really heard himself. But she would lay there and listen and listen as he told her every petty jealousy, every insecurity, even as he practiced his bravado, and she would sometimes think, Surely he can't tell this to someone he doesn't love. But she knew that it might slip away in a moment, and she knew that he didn't really love her, but she also knew that she couldn't leave as long as he would let her stay, and so she pretended, because there was nothing else to do. She swayed to the music and screamed for other bands and talked about the \"power\" of rock 'n' roll and occasionally went home with other guys, though that hurt so bad that sometimes she couldn't breathe. And she thought that she had everyone fooled. Until the day that Sapphire pokes her in the ribs with a long fingernail and demands that she stop looking at Jeff. I'm not looking at him , she says. Sapphire snorts and twirls a lock of straight hair around her finger. You're always looking at him. Even when you aren't looking at him, you're looking at him. And she knows that she's never fooled anyone, especially not herself. And after that, when the offer comes, the choice is obvious. And she tells him that she's leaving and he just looks at her with those sad eyes that break her heart, and he doesn't try to stop her. As she sits on the plane beside Ritchie Blackmore, all she can think about is that she might have taken this pretending too far. --- Estrella Starr \"She changed everything. She was the one that said, 'No more sex. No more exploiting our bodies and hearts'.\" She tries to be a Band Aide, but she knows she's really just a groupie. Ever since she met Penny at the Continental Hyatt house, she's wanted to be a Band Aide. She would sit on the floor by the ottoman and sneak glances out the window at the men with their guitars and their unkempt hair and that something—that celebrity—hanging all over them, and she would soak in every word Penny said. Room 301 was the school for Band Aides where Penny would talk about the music and what it meant and what it meant to inspire it and how it could only be the music or else they were all just cheap girls who wanted someone else's fame to rub off on them. We are rock and roll, Penny would say. There wouldn't be any songs, there wouldn't be any bands, there wouldn't be anything without us. And it all seemed so much bigger and more important than anything she had. And she really did believe every word Penny said. It helped she liked the music, liked to listen to it, loved to dance to it, but it wasn't enough, because she didn't love it like the other girls. Not the way Sapphire does—she's all surface unless she's listening to some song and then she's so deep that it scares her—or Beth does—like its her salvation—or Penny does—like, more than, anything, she wants to be a part of the music itself. What she loved was the rush. Was the rush and the parties and the laughter and the drinks and the hotels and the drugs and the changes of scenery and the people—especially the people. She's a follower, always has been, and she worships people. Especially famous people. It isn't necessarily that everyone knows them—that they are famous. It's just that, like Penny always said, famous people are just more interesting. These people aren't like the ones she grew up around, people who were quiet and content and sometimes desperate, people who worked hard and got married and had kids and lived quiet, unassuming lines. The thing that amazed her most was the people who really, truly seemed satisfied by that kind of life. She would look at them and know that that could never be enough for her because being still was the scariest thing of all. She hated it and so she ran after the people who never sat still for a moment, who ran after something everyone knew they would never find, who were movement and sound and color. She knows that this makes her one of those cheap groupies that Penny speaks of so derisively. But knowing that doesn't change anything, doesn't change the fact that, deep down, she's just in it for the excitement. And as time goes by, the excitement has less and less to do with the music until there isn't any music anymore—only movement and sound and color and then darkness. --- Beth \"I've seen the future, and this all works out reasonably well.\" She hates winter more than she loves anything. Her counselor at school, her priest at church, her parents at home used to lecture her. You've got it all wrong, Beth. You make choices not because you love something, but because you hate something else. Not because you want something, but because you're scared of its opposite. Not because of dreams, but because of nightmares. It's dangerous, Beth; it isn't healthy. You're all backwards. She's always seen the world in terms of negative space. And the thing she hates most in the world is winter. The auras die down in the winter, becoming a thin sheen of color that clings sticky and damp to people's skin. There isn't laughter or music or sunshine in the winter, and all she can think of is how the coldsilencedarkness scares her. Their songs carry summer along with them. Their songs are summer, and they weave it out of the strings of their guitars or beat it out of a drum. At home in Denver when she was young, and the world was gripped by winter, before she could chase after that summer, she would carry the record player into the bathroom and fill the tub up to the brim with steaming water and not come out until her skin was shriveled and blue and goosebumped. She had the biggest record collection in her grade at school, and everyone thought she was cool, but she never did it because of that. At the concerts, the auras flared up and vibrated and shimmered and danced and hummed, and she didn't really need drugs to see them. The music was more than enough. Bumpy oranges and silky yellows and rough purples and slick blues and feathery greens and velvety reds and cold silvers and warm golds—there were auras everywhere, and that was good enough for her. She meets a couple of girls in the bar at Swingo's one night in Cleveland and they start talking—about what they believe about music, about their favorite songs, their favorite bands. And before she knew it, she's one of the Band Aides, and she's legendary, and not just for making it about the music, but because sometimes she can just look at people and know who they are. It's the colors, you see. She isn't really picky about which songs she follows—after all, all rock is summer—but she likes Stillwater best. Russell is a burnt orange and Jeff is a faded red and Larry is a beat-up green and Ed is a demure blue. And the other girls are just as colorful—Sapphire's as vivid as her name, and Polexia is constant green, and Estrella is subdued pink, and Penny's such a bright yellow she can hardly bear to look at her. And when the music plays, it's summer, and she can hide in the colors, and she knows she'll keep running away from the winter for the rest of her life. --- Sapphire \"They don't even know what it is to be a fan. Y'know? To truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts.\" The first time it happened was in a stadium in the hometown she never really belonged in. 1970, the Allman Brothers Band tour right after the release of Idlewild South , and she'd come alone because she didn't want to share it with anyone else. She still remembers the smell of pot in the air and the cold metal bar biting into her bare midriff as she tried to get even closer to the stage and the magic that was coming from Duane's fingers. Every strain of \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" sounded like it was infusing the universe with meaning, and it may have just been the drugs, but she finally felt here was something worth loving. A little more than a year later, he was dead, and she was floating again. She'd wandered into the party that night after work—waitressing in a diner by the underpass was depressing enough that she had to party hard just to forget, and going home to Mama at the end of the day and seeing her big sad eyes didn't help anything—just wanting some beer and some weed and maybe a quick lay. But returning to the noise and the laughter and the music downstairs after puking her guts out in the bathroom, she passed a record player in an empty bedroom, and she locked the door behind her. There was a brand new record lying on the top of the pile on the desk and she barely glanced at the cover before letting the needle drop. The first song was a nice ordinary little love song, but she sank to the floor when \"Love Comes and Goes\" started playing. Sitting in the dim light stained orange by a colored lampshade, she felt like she had that night at the concert, like someone had tied a rope around her stomach and her heart and was jerking them from her body. The smell of pot clung to her hair and her eyes were bloodshot from too much beer. And she closed them and leaned her head back against the scratchy comforter on the bed behind her, and she gave herself up to the music. When Stillwater came to town the next summer, she walked straight to the back entrance of the club. Flirted a little with the dopey bouncer. Scared the timid little girl who was acting as stage manager out of her wits. Walked right up to the edge of the stage and listened and listened and listened, and when the music died away, there she was, waiting for them. She was the first one to stick around for more than a night, the first one to get invited onto the bus, the first one to hook the boys up with the pot and the harder drugs that she only took after her mama called. And when the other girls showed up, trickling in one by one—some permanents, some mere stopovers—she was never jealous. After all, despite all their talent on stage, there was nothing particularly special about the Stillwater boys offstage. After all, she had the music. She slept with the boys and they enjoyed it and so did she. She was always one of the favorites, and they shouted her name when she strutted into a room, and they bought her drinks and laughed at her jokes and she was practically one of them. And if none of them treated her like she was fragile—as Jeff treated Polexia—and if none of them told her secrets—as Larry sometimes told Estrella or Beth—and if none of them acted like the world would come crashing down if she wasn't around—as Russell acted around Penny—well, then, that was all right with her. After all, she had the music. And when a sweet, innocent little boy who she herself taught about the world showed up and wrote the truth and showed them all who they were and the whole damn thing seemed to fall apart, she left, just like everybody else. Because suddenly things were complicated where they never had been before, at least for everyone else. But it's still so easy, so simple, so clear for her. After all, she has the music. So here she is, walking into the impromptu cafeteria and going through the serving line and getting the last, overdone, too-tough steak and sitting down next to Russell at the table and glowering at the new girls and knowing that she always knew she would end up back here. Sapphire always comes back. --- Penny Lane \"I always tell the girls, never take it seriously. If you never take it seriously, you never get hurt. You never get hurt, you always have fun, and if you ever get lonely, just go to the record store and visit your friends.\" She planned Morocco right after Russell walked away. William \"introduced\" them, and he looked at her, and he was exactly the same. And she couldn't help the smile that spread across her face, because he was looking at her exactly as he always had, and he was Russell . But then he walked away, to prep for the show, and she was left sitting beside a sweet little boy who already looked at her with worshipful eyes and who somehow didn't judge her. And, as always when Russell was away, her head cleared and she saw herself. And the fact that her hand was still tingling where he'd held it in his own—tingling like she was some kind of schoolgirl in puppy love!—told her that she needed to get out. In an empty parking lot, she told William. Wear different clothes, find a different crowd, be completely different people–new names, he even suggested later, and she didn't say anything, because she knew that she'd go back to her old one, the one she hadn't used since that night Keith Richards handed her that Coke with ice and a lemon. Back before she was Penny, back when she was still Lady, her mother, who had married for love and always regretted it, would strut around the house in high heels and fake fur and fake pearls and talk in her fake British accent about all the exotic places she had visited with her exciting gentlemen friends before she settled down with Harry Goodman, a quite ordinary middleclass real estate agent from San Diego. And although Lady never agreed with her mother on much, even she couldn't deny that some of the places Evangeline Goodman (that wasn't her real name, either; apparently one of the few things Lady had inherited from her mother was the desire to change names) had visited were magical. She would sit on the faded chaise lounge beside her mother and look at old black and white photographs of Paris and Florence and Rio de Janeiro and Cairo and Marrakech. It's her one overwhelming memory of childhood, the one good memory of her mother. And when she got older and finally got enough backbone to talk back to her mother and all the fighting started in earnest, she would always threaten to run away to Morocco. What she doesn't tell William, weeks later when she tells him her name and all the things she's done—when she tells him she's told him all her secrets—is the way her mother used to take her chin between her ringed fingers and make her stare her in the eyes. Don't care too much, Lady , she would say. Caring gets you nowhere. She doesn't tell him how she failed to live up to those words. That night in San Diego, she made the decision about Morocco, but she pushed it aside for a little while as she followed Russell and the band up onto the stage. The music had always pushed everything else away. She remembered again, in the empty parking lot, because she could always remember when Russell wasn't around. She knew she needed Morocco, even then, and when she told William she needed a new crowd, what she meant was, It isn't just about the music anymore; I'm taking it seriously. And every time she was alone in a hotel room or dancing on the confetti-strewn stages by herself or during those few days back in San Diego, she would know that she had to leave. She was violating her own creed, and she had to go. But it was so hard to remember that when Russell was around, and every time he entered a room or let loose a cord or held her or even looked at her, she knew that she could never go. Eventually, though, the choice was made for her, and she found herself back in San Diego with a mother who gave her disapproving looks and a dresser drawer full of partial tickets and a faded photograph of Marrakech taped to her mirror and William's voice in her ears: There is no Morocco! Well, there is, and it's so frighteningly different and so dreadfully the same. And she finds a new crowd, mostly European expatriates and hippies dreaming of a new world. And they're so different from the crowds at the Riot House or Swingo's, and yet they're exactly the same. And the fancy cocktail parties punctuated by hookah and strange foreign drugs are so different, and yet they're exactly the same. And her life is completely different, and yet it's exactly the same, except that he isn't there. And, after all, she's still herself, and so she finds a record store, run by a Brit who looks shockingly like Mick Jagger and who ships in everything from Simon and Garfunkle to Joni Mitchell to Deep Purple to David Bowie. It takes her weeks to get up the courage to ask him if he's got any Stillwater, and he rummages around in the back for a while before pulling out Love Thing . And she sits on a stool with the headphones on her ears, and she doesn't cry. But she comes back, again and again and again, to visit her friends. And she's Penny and yet she's Lady. And she's happy and yet she's sad. And she's at home and yet she's lonely. And everything is completely different, and yet it's exactly the same. --- Reviews make my day!

I just came up with the story. William Miller was sitting in his room listening to the newest record of Still Water. This was his first time listening to it. He missed everyone from the band, then he missed all the band aids, then there was Penny Lane (who was a band aid). He hadn't seen any of them (except Russell) in five months. And Russell, he hadn't seen in about four months. William smiled at the memory of when Russell had come to his house and let him interview him. That had been a great day. Two Weeks Later... \"What do you mean there's someone at the door for me and you don't know who it is?\" asked William in a groggy voice. His mother had just come into his room and woken him up at ten in the morning to say, \"There was someone at the door to see him, but she didn't know who it was.\" \"I am not for sure who it is. Probably one of those rock friends of yours. And she looks pregnant,\" after saying this she left his room. Williams head was in a whirl. Who was it? One of the band aids? And if so, What did they want? William got up and got dressed. Then he hurried down the hall and into the livingroom. There sitting on the couch was Saphire. Williams mind went back to that night when they had slept together, in the hotel. \"Saphire, what are you...?\" \"William, it is so good to see you! We have all missed you. It just isn't the same without you hanging with us. Your probably wondering why I'm here? Well, I have some news for you William.\" she stopped for a second to catch her breath. William stared at her tummy. It was swollen with the unborn child. He was still staring when she began again,\"William, I am pregnant, as you can see. That isn't the news I have to tell you. The news is that you're the father.\" William just stared. Had he heard her right? But he had. Sorry, I had this in my head and had to get it out. Let me know what you think.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own Almost Famous or the Characters used in this story, but the story idea you are reading is all my own. Shock Wave - Chapter 2 William slowly backed up and sank down into the chair he knew would be there. Saphire was watching him. William knew she wanted him to say something, but he couldn't. He didn't know what to say. He had never expected anything like this. Williams mind traveled back in time to that night five and a half months ago... \"It's alright William. Just enjoy it. Just relax.\" That had been easier said than done. The whole time he had been having sex with Saphire, Polexia and Beth. He'd been thinking about Penny and wishing it were her... \"William?\" Saphire snapped him back to the present. \"Yeah? Sorry, I was just...\" he trailed off. \"I know that this must be hard to take in. I'm sorry I shouldn't have just dropped by, I just thought you should know. I mean, when my dad finally found out about me, boy was he pissed that my mom didn't tell him.\" \"Thank you, I want to know. I'm glad you told me.\" William looked around the room for a while trying to get courage to ask what kept repeating in his mind. \"So, what are you going to do? I mean are you going to have the baby?\" Saphire looked at him. \"I mean do you want it, the baby? Oh god, how did this happen?\" William ran his fingers through his hair. \"Don't answer that, I know how it happened I just can't believe it did. I mean I don't know how to be a father! I haven't had a father since I was young, I barely even remember him. I don't know the first thing you do...!\" \"William, calm down. It is going to be alright.\" Saphire walked over and looked down at William, who was still seated in the chair. \"William, to have a child is a gift. And if I know you at all, you will be a great dad to your child. Even Penny thinks so.\" \"Wait, Penny knows that you're pregnant and that it's mine?\" Before Saphire said yes he knew. \"Who else did you tell?\" he asked feeling very worried. \"Well, I told Penny and Beth, and then Polexia.\" William put his head in his hands. This was just great. Not only was he going to be a father at barely sixteen, but now everyone knew, even before he did. The worst was Penny knowing. He'd give almost anything for her not to know. \"So if Beth and Polexia know, you can bet they told everyone that they know, who in turn told everyone they know. Great, so everyone knows! Oh god, what am I going to do? How am I supposed to tell my mom?\" \"Tell me what?\" William turned around in his seat to see his mother standing in the doorway looking at him. I know this short, but this as far as I can go for now. Please tell me what you think and if you want me to write more, and I just might.

(Unfortunately.) Chapter 1: Home William tapped the steering wheel of the used Chevy, listening to the bland conversation of radio hosts and thinking. He was leaving San Diego. Tomorrow he would wake up in Italy, to spend the summer doing the Europe thing. His mother had not been happy about this, unsurprisingly, but God knew he'd had enough experience taking care of himself. In fact, it had been her idea nine years ago, he'd pointed out, to use those two extra years and explore; \"see what you like,\" she'd said. And he was twenty, after all. \"I'm feelin' a little nostalgic today, Jim,\" announced the radio loudly. The opening notes of Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\" floated through the speakers. William smiled automatically. \"I have to go home,\" he told Penny bluntly. Around them, choruses of 'hold me closer, tiny dancer' could be heard. Penny waggled her fingers at him, smiling as if she knew something he didn't. \"You are home.\" Home. By this time William was sure it was just a concept, an idea at most; something to console yourself when you were lonely. He thought he knew home until he left with Stillwater in '73, where he felt very much at home in various hotel rooms and a random party in Topeka. Then he returned to San Diego, which quickly became home again, and until graduation two days ago \"home\" was his dorm at USD. Tomorrow home would be a hostel in downtown Palermo. People got homesick all the time, but really you could make a home anywhere. If you went by that saying, \"Home is where the heart is,\" then home was wherever you were. Home was an imaginary place within reach whenever you felt disconsolate. And that wasn't necessarily a bad thing, just a little sad in a way. The song faded out slowly, to be followed by an extremely loud Zeppelin anthem. William drummed his fingers to the beat. Tomorrow he would be home. William buckled his seatbelt and slid on some headphones. Multiple guitars strummed, launching into a familiar Who song. The mobster type next to him frowned and shifted in irritation, signaling the stewardess for a beer. Rolling away from him, William faced the window. The view from the window was the best thing about flying. It was amazing and beautiful and rich and sickening all at once, and he loved it.[Chapter 2] DISCLAIMER: Still a poor writer of fics and other stories; still not Cameron Crowe. Thanks to those who reviewed! For a minute or two William stood andrnwatched, blinking in disbelief; for a minute or two he toyed with thernidea of letting her go, then holing up in his Best Western room forrnthe next two days, vanishing from Morocco as if a phantom. But thenrnshe moved from the newsstand at which she stood, turned to leave,rnand he found that his feet were pounding against the tile floor.

I woke up and I felt like I was going to die because I was so tired and I didn't want to go to this singing camp but I had to because I wanted to be a singer so I bet it would help me be a better singer. So I got up and I got dressed I put on my Ed Hardy T-shirt and I put on my hot pink Juicy outfit and my pink sparkly Converse and I went to go brush my teeth and do my hair. After I got done brushing my teeth and doing my hair I went down stairs and saw my mom making breakfast. \"Mom what are you making\" I said. \"Pancakes, and did you get all your stuff yet Miley?\" my mom said. \"Yes, why wouldn't I, mom the bus is going to be here like in 15 minutes can you hurry up?\" I said. \"Don't worry Miley It will be done in like in 2 minutes don't worry.\" Mom said. \"Sorry I just am really nerves because what if I'm not good enough at signing for the camp?\" I said. \"Trust me honey you will be, now here are your pancakes and are you sure you have everything packed?\" said my mom the thousandth time. \"Yes I am positive I have everything so don't worry and If I forget something I just will go to the store right by the camp and get it don't worry\" I said. Beep beep. \"Mom there's the bus I love you, and I promise I will call you every day if I remember so don't worry about it\" I said. \"Ok I love you Miley have fun!\" my mom said sadly not trying to cry. I picked up my bag and ran to the bus. When I got on the bus I say so many people, in the back there was an empty seat so I went to sit down in the seat. Next to the seat there was this really hot guy listening to his I pod. He looked at me and then looked away with a grin on his face. I said to him \"Hi my name is Miley Miles what's your name?\" He looked at me and he said, \"My name is Evan Davidson.\" He still had like a grin on his face. \"How old are you?\" I said looking happy. \"I'm 17 you?\" Evan said. \"I'm 17 too!\" I said excited. \"So you are a good singer I bet\" I said. \"I guess\" Evan said weirdly. \"Are you any good?\" Evan said. \"Umm I don't really know?\" I said questionably. \"You must be if you're on this bus\" he said. \"Haha I bet I am good then\" I said laughing for no reason. Then the bus came to the last stop and three girls came on the bus and this one girl who is gorges came and sat my Evan. She said \"Hi Evan we haven't seen each other in so long how come you couldn't come over I missed you so much?\" \"I was just to busy working on songs for this camp….\" \"Oh ok honey.\" Then the girl kissed him on the lips. \"Who are you?\" the girl said to me. \"I'm Miley Miles\" I said. She said \"I'm Ashley Simons, and if haven't met my boyfriend his name is Evan Davidson\" Ashley said. \"Oh I like your name, and I met him when I got on the bus\" I said. \"Oh ok well stay way from him he is my boyfriend!\" she said meanly. From that point on I new I was going to stay away from Evan for awhile and I new now this camp wasn't going to be the best camp ever.[Chapter 2] Whennthe bus driver yelled time to get off the bus I took my bag and Inhurried off the bus. When I got off everything looked to beautifulnthe lake sparkled. When everybody got off the bus the camp managernarranged us into groups of four to go to our cabins and of course Ingot stuck with Evans girlfriend Ashley, it's just my luck. Inhurried up and got into the cabin when Ashley was outside talking tonEvan so I went by the window to see what there talking about. Ashleynsaid, \"Make sure you stay away from Miley she seems like she wouldnsteal you from me.\" \"Trust me, Miley, is not going to comenbetween us I promise.\" \"Ok I will see you in a little bit when wenhave to go and meet for lunch at the cafeteria,\" Ashley said. \"OknI will see you in a little bit.\" Ashley walked in and then she hadna grin on her face. \"Inguess I have to be stuck with you in this cabin,\" Ashley said stillnhaving that grin on her face. \"I guess so.\" \"The other twongirls came in and introduced them selves. There was this one tallnblond skinny girl and her name was Jenna Blake. The other girl wasnshort and skinny and had brown hair, her name was Sydney White. Theynlooked really nice!

He stood up and scratched himself - hisnballs, his hair, his chest. He walked over to his record collectionnand picked out Tommy , lowering the arm and listening to ThenWho fill his room. He walked to his closet, throwing a Stillwaternt-shirt over his heads, jumping in to his jeans and throwing his bagnover his shoulder. He was off for another day at work, another daynediting for Rolling Stone. Evernsince the final interview with Jeff, William felt like all he did wasnedit other peoples work. As other people sent in useless drivel aboutnBowie and AC/DC and other bands that William liked, but not enough tonwrite about. And he had to read it all. It was his job. It only paidn$2.75 an hour, but it kept him in all the records and passes that henwanted, which was more than he could have ever asked for. \"Hinmom,\" he said, as he walked in to the kitchen and found his momnpouring a glass of orange juice, a plate of pancakes already sittingnon the counter. \"Hi,nhoney,\" she said, reaching up and kissing his forehead. He smilednand took the glass or orange juice, walking out the door, waving overnhis shoulder. \"But, I made you breakfast,\" she said as the doornslammed. Williamnknew it was wrong to just walk out on his mom, but he hadn't reallynbeen in a talking mood for a while. He was going through Pennynwithdrawal. He wanted to see her, wanted to touch her, wanted to hearnher voice. It had been almost seven months since he had last seennher, even longer since the days of Tiny Dancer, and Williamnwas worried that she was forgetting him. That thought was terrifyingnhim, because he sure wasn't forgetting her. Thenwalk to the office was usually long enough for him to think aboutnlots of things, including which pieces he wanted to pass on for thenmagazine. But lately, the only thing he had been thinking about wasnthe first time he had met Penny Lane - and he replayed the momentnover and over in his head until he was in his office, and then againnand again until he went to bed that night. Some people called it ansickness. He called it Penny Lane. Wenare not groupies. We don't sleep with the band. We inspire. We - wenare band aids. Inalways tell the girls - never get serious. Never get serious, nevernget hurt. Never get hurt, you can keep having fun - and if you evernget sad, you just go to the record store to see all your friends. Younare home. Anythingnshe said. Everything she said. That stupid coat, those hugensunglasses, the smile that always let you know that she knew morenthan you did, even if she didn't know what. Thatnday, when William walked in to work, things felt different. The airnwas…off. In a way he hadn't felt since the day his foot hit thenfloor of the Stillwater tour bus. He stopped in with the generalnreciptionist and asked if he had any messages. Usually she justnscoffed and waved him on - he wasn't high up on the magazine foodnchain, but today she handed a small, regulation-pink paper. PennynLane was in France. And William Miller was going to interview her.nTomorrow. Holdnme closer tiny dancer.[Chapter 2] \"WilliamnMiller.\" \"PennynLane.\" \"Accueil,nmon amie.\" \"Thanks,\"nWilliam said, walking in to the small entry way. His head spun anlittle. He wasn't supposed to be here. Well, technically, he wasnsupposed to be here. But being here felt to weird. A day ago, he hadnbeen on a plane, nodding in and out of sleep and he hurtled to andifferent country and the women he hadn't seen in months. And nownhere he was. He was walking in to her small, grungy apartment. Onenroom. A mattress on the floor. Beaded curtains in place of a door tonthe bathroom. No kitchen. Not the idea of glamour William knew thatnPenny wanted. \"Thenplace is, uh, nice.\" \"Merci.nI just moved in the other day. Did you know that Hendrix is doing antour of Europe?\" \"Yes.nYes I did.\" \"Inknew you would. After all, you are The Enemy. Anyway, I met up withnSapphire and her and I were in Belgium for almost two weeks, onnJimi's card. Let me just tell you, the chocolate in Belgium-\" \"Whyndidn't you call me?\" The words escaped his lips faster than henhad meant them too. It wasn't supposed to be like this. He was herenon business. HE was here to interview Penny Lane for Rolling Stone,nsome human interest story about the girls behind the great bands. Henwasn't here to question or reminisce, or ask her why she didn'tncall. He wasn't supposed to. But he did. \"Whatndo you mean?\" \"Don'tnplay stupid, Penny. Please. That's not who you are. You're anLady.\" Pennynlooked down and smile. No one ever called her by her real name. Itnwas a foreign name to her. Lady Goodman was a little girl with bowsnin her hair and buckles on her shoes who loved ponies and dolls andntea parties and was mommies little princess and daddies good girl.nPenny Lane wore her hair down and loved tye-dye and camel-skin cotesnand aviators, who slept with rock stars and fell in love and neverntalked to her mom or dad and loved music and drinks and going to thenrecord store. Lady and Penny hadn't been the same in a long, longntime. \"William,nmon amie. Please, have a seat.\" \"Indon't want to sit.\" \"Suitnyourself.\" Penny turned and walked to her bed, across the room,nlying down and cocking her head up on her elbow. \"It's going tonbe rather hard to do the interview from this far away, but I supposenif I yell loud enough, we should be alright.\" Reluctantly, Williamnsmiled and walked across the room, sitting down on the floor againstnthe wall. \"Sontell me, Penny Lane, what was it like being with Russell fromnStillwater? Do you believe you had any kind of influence on thenmusic?\" William continued to ask questions, and Penny continued tonanswer. She never gave a true answer, William noticed. She had longnago become the master of the double entendre, the misty eyed questionnas a response, the coy laugh and the refusal to answer. Williamnwasn't sure how long the interview lasted, but when he looked upnagain, it was dark outside and he was ravished. \"Inam in drastic need of sustenance,\" he muttered, opening Penny'snone window, trying desperately to get some more air recirculatingnthrough the small apartment. \"Ah,nyes. The need for food is one felt by many. How would you like me tontake you to the best little French café in the area?\" \"Wouldnyou do that?\" \"WouldnI do that? You drastically underestimate my powers as a hostess,nWilliam Miller.\" \"I'vennever estimated your powers as a hostess. You've never hosted menbefore.\" \"Touché,nmy friend. Touché. Well, tonight consider me your hostessnextraordinaire. I will show you the best restaurant, the bestncocktails bar, and the best club this side of the rive Seine.\" \"Alright.\" \"Thennjust let me get ready.\" She shimmied off the mattress and walked tonher bathroom, the only other room in the small apartment. Through thencracked door, William could see all of Penny's clothes hanging fromnthe shower curtain, spilling in to the tub and out on to the floor.nHe wondered where she showered, but decided that he didn't want tonknow. He watched as she changed her shirt, the smooth skin of hernback sliding up and down his spine. He watched as she fluffed hernhair, smoothing on some lipstick and sliding a pair of aviators overnthem. Suddenly, she was standing in front of him. \"Younknow, you never did tell me why you didn't call. I was waiting tonhear from you.\" Shentook a hold of his hand and pulled him up, leading him out the door.nAs she turned to lock it, he caught the slightest trace of hernperfume. The sent almost knocked him out. It was just so…Penny. \"Allnin due time, William. I promise you, all will be answered in goodntime.\" Inleave tomorrow night, William thought. Due time better comenbefore then, or I might just go crazy. Countnthe headlights on the highway.

This is my first fan fiction in years. I used to write a lot of them under another name. Good ones, too. But when depression and writer's block hit you dead in the face going one million miles an hour, you tend to forget about how much happiness and tranquility writing fan fiction brings you. Disclaimer - I don't own the Tremor Brothers, but I do own their sister Joanna and the goofy shit that follows. Everything else belongs to their respectful owners. Warning - A lot of fluff. :3 I was also really intoxicated when I wrote this, so there's gonna be OOC. Plot - The Tremors are pegged as heavy hitting assassins with near zero regard for human life...which ain't bullshit. Buuuuut they love their little sister more than killing shit. And, every once in a while, they love to play a good game of chase... Yer Gonna Git It . The forest was lovely this time of day. It was before noon, a pleasant breeze stirred up the grounded leaves; the birds were chirping as they pecked around looking for worms, but there weren't too many birds so it wasn't annoying. The sun's rays shown between the trees. It was enchanting... Or it would've been if booted feet hadn't ran through, disturbing the birds making them get the fuck outta dodge and fly up to the highest tree branch. The booted feet belonged to a blonde haired blue eyed young woman by the name of Joanna. And boy was she haulin' ass. She was an excellent runner and in real decent health. Her brothers, who were currently 'playing' with her, were actually heavy duty speed freaks. You'd think that since they ate that garbage like it was candy then they wouldn't be able to function. Honestly, it didn't bother Joanna. If her brothers were around, she enjoyed the time spent with them. \"Boo!\" Lester, her middle eldest landed in front of her by jumping from a high tree branch. How he didn't break something was anyone's guess. \"Gah!\" Joanna slid across the dirt so she wouldn't run into him, and then ran a different way. Lester watched her run with an amused grin plastered on his face and lifted up his goggles to rest on his forehead. He waited a minute before shouting, \"Darwin! Jeeves! JoJo high tailed it to the East!\" He cackled after Joanna yelled at him to shut up. Now, the Tremor Brothers weren't the smartest human beings on the planet (actually, anyone who knew who they were and lived to tell about it would say the same thing), but damn if they didn't know how to track humans and animals alike when they were in the woods. And Lester had already tracked her down and he was usually a clueless fuck so it was only a matter of time before the other two spotted her. Darwin was already chuckling at the thought of Joanna thinking she could outrun them again. Last week, she did manage to keep away from them and get home before they could catch her. When they reached the house, she was sitting on the porch drunker than hell (a rare thing) asking where the fuck they've been all day. The only reason she got to the house first was 'cause Jeeves' big ass had a sudden case of the flu. He played 'chase', though not at his best. But he was feeling 100% today. And Joanna was gonna git it for being so cocky... Joanna ran as fast as she could with her boots pounding on the dirt. She wished she hadn't worn jeans, she was starting to get warm. She also cursed at herself for not bothering to put her hair up. At least she was wearing a tank top though. She didn't know how long she was going to keep her pace; she was starting to get winded. Lester decided to be a giant turd and give her position away, so there was no telling when - \"Gotcha!\" Jeeves, her giant 6'7'', built-like-a-tree brother whipped out from behind a large Oak and lifted her up in his arms. *He laughed his head off, grinning as his sister started laughing and squirmy while pushing on Jeeves shoulders in vain. \"Ah gotchu JoJo! Yew can't get away this time...\" Joanna yelped and giggled as he tossed her up, catching her with his large hands then throwing her over his broad shoulder and started walking back the way she had just ran from. \"Hey, Darwin! Lester!\" Jeeves called out. \"I got JoJo!\" The young woman groaned, \"Do you have to announce it?\" Jeeves smacked her ass. \"Ouch, ya fucker!\" She awkwardly smacked the back of his mo-hawked head and he started to spin her around which caused her to start laughing and cursin' at him. They both became dizzy after a while so Jeeves stopped spinning and started walking toward Darwin and Lester who caught up to them, and found Joanna's predicament funnier than hell. Jeeves lowered his sister down and playfully wrestled her to the ground. She tried to sit up but Jeeves put some of his weight on her legs and Darwin, who knelt down, grabbed her arms and held them above her head. Lester decided he was going to sit on a tree stump and watch. \"What are you doing?\" Joanna asked, apprehensively. Usually, Jeeves would just carry her home while Darwin and Lester threw harmless insects on her hair. But this was something entirely different. Darwin looked down at her, holding her wrists in his hands. \"Lettin' you know yer place as our baby sister.\" Jeeves put his forehead to Joanna's and chuckled, \"Yerher gonna git it, JoJo...\" He sat back up and started wriggling his fingers. Joanna's eyes widened and she started to shake her head, to which Jeeves nodded and he dug his fingers into her waist. Joanna started screaming, laughing and kicking her feet in the dirt. \"STAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAP! NAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Lester was laughing like a retarded hyena from his seat on the stump. Darwin chuckled, \"It's only gonna git worse, kiddo.\" He nodded at Jeeves who suddenly drove his long thumbs into her armpits. Her reaction was what the brothers were hoping for as Joanna screamed and laughed louder than hell and tried pulling her arms down, but Darwin had a solid grip on her wrists. Little tears were streaming down her face as she screamed, \"STHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAP! PLEHEHEHEHEHEHESSEE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!\" Joanna regretted wearing a tank top. \"Yer beggin' already?\" Darwin asked, wearing a shit-eating grin. Joanna was laughing harder than she had in a long time. Jeeves started tickling her ribs which made her squirm like a worm. Soon her laughter because silent and her face was becoming red, so Darwin finally FINALLY had Jeeves quit his torture on their poor sister. Darwin let her arms go and she just lay there a heavy breathing, giggling mess. Jeeves moved her hair out of her face just as Lester hopped off of the stump. \"That'll teach yew, JoJo.\" \"Fuck off.\" Joanna breathed out. \"Yew want a 'nother round?\" Jeeves threatened playfully, digging his long fingers into her ribs. \"No!\" Joanna squealed, clamping her hands around her brother's wrists. \"Alright, enough foolin' around; let's git some lunch.\" Darwin said as he stood up. Jeeves stood up over his sister at the mention of food, and since she wasn't moving fast enough he decided to scoop her up underneath her arms and sling her over his shoulder. He walked away with Lester and Darwin following closely, talking about what they wanted to cook up for lunch. Joanna rested her elbows on her brother's back and put her face in her hands. \"So what the hell made you guys wanna tickle me?\" \"Cuz it was funny.\" Lester said, grinning like a fool. He went back to talking about food with Darwin. Guess that was the only answer she was getting. Oh, well. It was better than having bugs thrown in her thick hair that were a bitch and a half to get out. Granted, it was harmless; just really annoying. Joanna started to smile lazily. Darwin did a double take and saw this. \"Whatcha smilin' for, kid?\" His sister giggled and shook her head. \"Nothing...\" ... END - See? I told you there was OOC. Again, this is my first fanfic in years. I kinda thought Smokin' Aces needed a ticklefic. I don't know why, but I thought it would be cute to write a fic like this. I won't respond to rude reviews. Constructive criticism; always. :) By the way, the asterisk * placed beside the sentence 'He laughed his head off, grinning...' Yeah, I was trying to imagine his laugh from when he was wrestling with Lester and laughed in his face after taking him down on the hood of the car. ","Summary":" Okay, guys. This is my first fan fiction in years. I used to write a lot of them under another name"},{"Movie":"Smokin' Aces","Title":"The First Tremor Christmas","Author":"The Noble Rot","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7632804","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"You got any memories of Christmas from the times when I wasn't there?\", Darwin asked me, taking a sip of beer. It was a few days before Christmas, and we were sitting in a bar in town together enjoying a couple drinks before the long drive home. I swirled my beer around in the bottle and glanced up at the tiny Christmas tree over the bar, my gaze far away. \"Yeah I do. After the second time ya ran away, actually. You remember how we never did get no Christmas tree er nothin'? No presents, neither. Well, Jeevesie was still a little fella, maybe six. I was nine. It was the first year I decided ta take matters inta my own hands. I did everythin' I could fer money, mostly doin' yard work an' cleanin' stables. Shit like that. There was this fire truck I wanted ta buy fer Jeeves. You know how he loved fire trucks. Jeeves only knew about Christmas at all 'cause they showed them pageants on the old black an' white television in the livin' room. You remember it? Anyhow, he asked Fritz round about September o' that year how come Santa never came ta our trailer. Fritz told him Santa didn't cater ta no white trash folk like us. Then he left, out ta the bar or someplace. I had a cryin' little brother on my hands fer the rest o' the night. Broke his heart, see, cause he wanted more 'n anythin' fer some little bit o' magic in life. Things was so bleak. We was hungry most o' the time, even though I made goddamn sure Jeevesie got fed even if it meant goin' ta bed with nothin' in my stomach. Fuck it. Badger's er tough, even baby badgers.\" I took another drink and held up the empty bottle, waving it slightly at Mike the bartender. He came over and replaced it immediately. I pried off the cap and continued. \"So I worked. Nine years old, out there muckin' horse shit on a pitchfork, helpin' ta haul in the harvest, rakin' leaves, runnin' a mower. Gettin' five bucks here, three bucks there, seven over there. One time this real sweet lady gave me a twenty dollar bill fer cleanin' out her basement. She gave me that twenty dollars an' also her late husband's Swiss Army knife. I ain't never seen nothin' so goddamn cool as that Swiss Army knife in my whole entire life. It had literally everythin' on it. Nail file, scissors, tweezers, two kindsa screwdrivers, tooth pick, seven types o' blade. Shit, it was somethin' else! I tucked it in my pocket an' ran home like the wind. I knew what ta do with it. Right then, moment it was in my hands, I knew. \"Anyhow, by the time Christmas rolled around I had a hundred an' fifty three dollars saved. Went right out two weeks before Christmas an' bought a shitload o' canned food, mostly Spam an' baked beans, ta hide under my bed so I could feed Jeeves when he got the tummy rumbles in the night. Then I went to the Dollar Mart an' bought a big ol' string a lights, some shiny ornaments, some tinsel. An' I bought a toy fire truck an' a helmet an' some thick socks an' a pair o' boys' extra large pajamas. Lotta candy, all the candy we wanted but Fritz never gave us. I also picked up a ham from Old Man Teigler's pig farm an' got some taters an' carrots from the grocer. Took it all home, hid the gifts an' lights in the garage. Buried the ham under some slabs o' deer haunch in the big outdoor freezer. I could barely sleep fer two weeks.\" I turned to look at Darwin, still remembering that moment. I can almost feel it again just as clearly, what I felt then. A young boy forced too soon into a man's world, about to perform my first great act of kindness and charity for the person I loved most in the world. \"Christmas Eve came, Jeeves fell asleep on the floor under our window, waitin' on Santa with desperate hope in his swollen red eyes. Moment he passed out, I got up an' covered him with my blanket, then crept on outta our bedroom an' down the hall. Fritz had this old saw, he kept it in the shed up on a hook. I got the key from his jacket an' went on out there ta fetch it, tryin' like hell ta be as quiet as a church mouse. Fritz was sleepin', ya see, an' you remember how he hated gettin' woke up fer any reason. I'd felt the bite o' that belt just a day earlier an' I still had a limp...wasn't too keen on gettin' a second helpin'. I had work ta do.\" I chuckled and took another long drink, looking up at the Christmas tree. \"Well I got the shed open an' I got the saw down alright. No trouble there. An' I took it an' headed out ta the woods. \"Took me an hour ta find the right tree, a 6-footer with real nice boughs. Another half hour ta saw the motherfucker down, but I'd taken trees down before as part o' my odd jobs an' I knew what ta do. I finally got that sumbitch down an' I drug it on home in the moonlight through the snow. That was some walk, Darwin, lemme tell you. I was all sore an' tuckered out when I got ta the bottom o' those steps. But I was glad I done it. So I set the saw back in the shed an' lock it, then I came on back ta the front steps an' started ta haul the tree up. I took one step when I heard a voice, the last voice I wanted ta hear. \"What in tarnation do you think you're doin', boy?\" It was Fritz. He was standin' in his red union suit in the open door, watchin' me struggle up the steps with a goddamn fir tree.\" I rubbed the back of my neck, shaking my head. \"What the fuck was I gonna say? I looked him dead in the eye an' told him the truth. \"I'm bringin' Christmas ta Jeeves, sir.\" Well that old fucker eyed me fer what seemed an eternity, an' I looked right back at him. Then he nodded one time. \"Well, Lester,\" he says ta me, he says, \"You better let me help ya haul that thing inside before we both catch our death out here.\"\" Over thirty years later, I was still mystified by the moment. My voice lowered as I looked at Darwin again, gesturing toward the tiny tree over the bar. \"A miracle, ya know? So he came down them steps an' helped me get that big ol' tree inside, both of us tryin' ta be quiet so as not ta wake Jeeves. He put the tree in an old bucket an' I filled it up with rocks from the yard an' a couple bricks. Then I snuck on out to the garage an' brought in everythin' I'd bought. Fritz didn't say nothin' an' he didn't ask how I come by the money fer it all. He knew. Together we put the lights an' the ornaments an' the tinsel on. We wrapped up the truck an' the helmet an' the socks an' pajamas in newspaper an' tied the packages with boot laces, then put 'em under the tree. Then we plugged it in an' just stood back. \"I tell ya Darwin,that was the most beautiful tree I ever did see in my whole life. Me an' Fritz just stood there, starin' an' bein' quiet, lookin' at what we done. Then he patted me on the shoulder once an' went on back ta bed. I won't bore ya with how I crept back out to the freezer an' got the ham. How I thawed it in the sink under warm water while I preheated the oven an' cut up the vegetables. I won't get inta the details o' the spices I improvised from the kitchen, or how I pounded stale biscuits out on the back steps in a plastic bag ta make bread crumbs fer the stuffin' I wanted ta create. Suffice it ta say that I spent the better part o' the wee hours cookin' up a storm. I slow-cooked that ham, bastin' it in its own juices. I cut up the carrots an' taters an' put 'em in there too with some bay leaves an' salt an' pepper. I made stuffin' an' gravy with the juices too. I made pie crust, an' pared down apples an' added a ton o' cinnamon ta make a pie. It was the smell o' the food as woke up the house. Next thing I knew, the light was creepin' across the frosted windows an' I could hear runnin' feet in the hall. \"I looked over, an' Jeeves was standin' in the door o' the kitchen in his too-small sweatpants an' threadbare t-shirt just grinnin' at me. He was so happy, his whole face was glowin'. I hugged him an' said \"Merry Christmas, Jeeves.\" He chuckled an' hugged on me, happy as a puppy that he was gonna get fed, an' he ran off towards the livin' room ta watch television while I finished up cookin'. Shit, you know I had ta follow him. He stopped dead in the entrance to the room, starin' at the Christmas tree with eyes like saucers. Just starin' an' starin'. The look on his face was somethin' I will never ferget as long as I live. He took a few timid, shy steps forward an' just kept lookin' as though he couldn't believe his eyes. I heard Fritz come up behind us, just standin' in the hallway watchin' Jeeves. He put his hand on my shoulder again, an' I looked up at him. We were both grinnin'. Jeeves suddenly burst out shoutin', \"SANTA FOUND US! SANTA CAME! LESTER, LOOK! DADDY, COME SEE! SANTA WAS HERE!\" \"Instead o' gettin' pissed at Jeeves fer yellin' in the house, Fritz busted out laughin' an' came inta the room an' hugged him. Then he winked at me. \"He sure did, Jeeves. Looks like Santa found ya after all.\"\" I fell silent for a few minutes then, staring at the lights, remembering. \"So we had a Christmas for the first time ever. I cooked up the best ham in the world an' there was so much we couldn't eat it all in one day even with Jeeves's appetite. An' after we ate, Jeeves got ta open his presents. We sat in the livin' room an' laughed as he ran around makin' siren noises in his new hat, we clapped an' cheered an' whistled when he pulled on his new pajamas an' socks an' strutted across the floor like a fashion model. We made pretend fires out o' crumpled paper so Jeeves could race to the rescue with his new truck. When Jeeves finally fell asleep from too much excitement and a full belly with his arms around his fire truck, still wearin' that helmet, Fritz an' me just kinda sat back an' relaxed. It started ta snow outside. I went over ta his chair an' pulled out a small package wrapped in tin foil, an' I put it in his hand. \"What's this now, boy?\" he wanted ta know. I didn't say nothin', an' he unfolded the foil. It was the Swiss Army knife. He just looked up at me, an' I looked back down at him. Then I said, real soft, \"Merry Christmas, Daddy.\" An' he nodded his head. An' then he said, all soft an' gruff-like, \"Merry Christmas, Lester.\" ","Summary":" \"You got any memories of Christmas from the times when I wasn't there?\", Darwin asked me, taking "},{"Movie":"Smokin' Aces","Title":"Love Triangle","Author":"Candie1981","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8074947","Passage":"[Chapter 1] LOVE TRIANGLE Emma Deluca – Original character Nicholas – Jared Keeso Darwin Tremor – Chris Pine Jeeves Tremor – Kevin Durand Lester Tremor – Maury Sterling Kaitlyn Tremor – Autumn Reeser Emma awoke to the sounds of a hospital room, beeps and whirrs of machinery and the low talk of the doctors and nurses in the hallways. Her finger twitched as her eyes slowly opened and she could feel an extra weight shift on the bed. Her fingers tightened around the hand that held hers. \"Nic?\" She asked, groggily. \"Em'? God it's good to hear your voice!\" Nicholas smiled as he squeezed her hand, \"How do you feel?\" \"Like I was hit by a freight train!\" She moaned as she tried to sit up a little, but was met by a sharp pain in her side. She hissed at it and lay back down. \"Hey, take it easy, the doctors said you're gonna be sore for a while!\" Nicholas replied. \"How long have I been out?\" \"A few days. The doctors weren't expecting you to be awake so soon!\" \"I almost wish I wasn't!\" She replied, rubbing a hand over her face. Her eyes finally became unblurred and focused on the young man, he was still in his suit, though the tie and coat long disregarded, his usually neat hair dishevelled and he looked like he hadn't had a decent night's sleep in weeks! \"Damn, Nic, you look like shit!\" She replied with a grin. \"How long have you been here?\" He just looked at her, \"You haven't left?\" \"Nope, I couldn't leave you here alone, even though Agent Baker has twenty-four hour security on your door!\" He replied after giving himself the once over. \"Security? What for?\" She was confused, the last thing she could remember was getting on a plane in Quantico. \"You don't remember?\" She thought for a moment, \"The case! I didn't complete it, did I?\" Nicholas shook his head, \"You don't remember anything?\" \"Not really, I remember getting on the plane, but nothing after that!\" He gave her a small smile, \"It's ok, the main thing is that you're going to be alright!\" He leaned over and kissed her forehead. \"I'm gonna let the doctor know that your awake, I won't be long.\" Emma held his hand tighter, she knew that her case involved the Tremors and she knew she'd failed and they were still out there, now she was their newest target! That was the reason for all the security. Nicholas stopped mid-stand, \"Don't worry, your completely safe here. Baker handpicked the agents to guard you!\" He gave her hand a gentle squeeze and kissed the back of her fingers. She felt the hot tingle behind her eyes and she forced the tears back. She knew that Darwin and his siblings would have their revenge and it didn't matter how many men where outside that door, they would reach her, it was all just a matter of time! Finally, she nodded her consent for him to leave, turning her face away as the tears she fought so hard to keep from falling rolled over her cheeks. She couldn't let Nic see her like this, she hated for him to see her in this hospital bed, weak and useless. She saw the concern in her partners face, felt it in his touch. He loved her and she knew he was blaming himself for the situation they were both now facing. The memories of the last few weeks where slowly starting to come back to her. The meeting her and Nicholas had about the case with Agent Baker, her decision to go undercover and get inside the Tremors psycho little speed filled world. How furious Nicholas was when she agreed to the task, he tried to talk her out of it and Baker too, but Baker was convinced that Emma was the best suited agent in the F.B.I for the case. She remembered their last night together before she flew out to Nevada, Nic was still beside himself with grief that he couldn't change her mind. She remembered how he told her he loved her, his passionate, pleading kisses and how he made love to her, like it was the last time they would be together. How his beautiful blue eyes surveyed her face, still pleading for her not to go, but he knew how stubborn she was. She loved her job and she wasn't going to turn down one case, no matter what the cost. Her thoughts where lost in that last night she spent with Nic, when the doctor came in. \"Well, well, look who's awake!\" He smiled, \"How do you feel?\" Emma stared at him blankly for a second, \"O.K. I guess. Everything is sore and stiff!\" \"Well, considering the ordeal you went through, you're very lucky in deed!\" The doctor replied, \"Do you remember anything of what happened?\" \"I remember a little, but mostly before I left for Nevada!\" She replied. \"Well, that's normal. After such a traumatic incident, the brain will temporarily shut off those memories, it is a defense mechanism. Persons retain the capacity to learn new information and there may be some partial or complete recovery of those memories. Try not to force them, let them come naturally. Forcing them may result in the brain repressing them further and you may never regain them.\" The doctor replied, \"We'll set up a time for you to see a specialist who will help you deal better with the events of the last few months.\" \"A shrink? Doc, look, I really don't think I need to see one of those…\" \"I know, a lot of patients are embarrassed by having to consult with a psychiatrist at first, but in the end they are thankful for the opportunity!\" She decided not to argue and left it at that, even though she thought shrinks where for crazy people. \"Now, let's just have a look at you and see which of these machines we can get rid of!\" The doctor checked her over, \"Yes young lady, you are very lucky to be alive, your suffering from a concussion, numerous cuts and bruises and a sprained knee, along with one major gunshot wound and one minor!\" He removed the gauze from below her ribs, \"The bullet went right through, missing any vital organs and arteries! But this one,\" He removed the gauze from her shoulder, this one could have been a lot worse if it wasn't for Agent Nicholas applying pressure to it until EMS responded. It nicked a main artery and you very well could have bled out! You had an angel watching over you that day!\" He motioned for her to sit up as best she could to inspect the exit wound on her back , \"Well, I think everything but the I.V. can go! I'll send in a nurse to take care of that. I'll be back later to check up on you again, Agent Deluca!\" \"Hey! Brought a snack from the cafeteria, didn't know if you'd be hungry or not!\" Nicholas replied as he stepped into the room. She smiled as he sat beside her, \"Thanks! But I'm not really hungry!\" She grabbed the coffee out of his hand, \"But this'll do!\" She grinned. \"I should have seen that comin'! He replied, \"So what did the doctor say?\" \"Temporary amnesia, \"She replied, sipping on the hot coffee. He looked worried, \"Well, repressed memories, I can remember everything leading up to my flight here, but after that, not much, just blurs of stuff that I'm not even sure are real or not yet!\" \"Do you remember anything about the night before you left Quantico?\" He asked sheepishly. She smiled and grabbed his collar, pulling him to her, \"I remember everything about that night!\" He searched her eyes, finding a passion in them he rarely saw, in that split second before their lips met. Their embrace lasted for what seemed like forever, Nicholas' hand gently rubbing her cheek as they separated, looking into his icy blue eyes, she replied, \"I love you Nic, that's one thing I couldn't forget!\" He smiled down at her, placing his forehead against hers, \"I love you too!\" And he kissed her nose, which she crinkled up. They sat there in silence, fingers intertwined for a few minutes. \"Nic?\" \"Hmmm?\" \"Tell me what happened, it might trigger my memory or something.\" He hesitated, \"Please?\" He sat back in the chair, keeping her hand in his, \"Are you sure? I mean, it's only been a few hours.\" But he saw the determined plea in her eyes. \"Well, when you last checked in with Central Intelligence, you said that the Tremors had picked up another hit and that it was going down in a few days. They were going after some mob mark, Buddy Israel, but that was it! Jenna was able to find out more info about Israel, he was the son of a mob boss, Primo Spirazza. Apparently, Israel was planning on outing his father to the authorities, something to do with Spirazza cutting him out of the family business. He was holed up in a casino in Lake Tahoe. The Tremors got the hit, one million for Israel. Baker sent out a team to get to Israel before them and to help you bring them in.\" \"And where you part of that team?\" \"Yeah, Baker wasn't going to let me at first, but I was going out of my head with you gone. I wanted to be there, to help you get out of that mess!\" His face turned a slight shade of pink, \"I knew you could do it on your own, but I was afraid what might happen to you if those speed-freak Nazi found out who you really where. I couldn't lose you!\" After a few moments of shared silence, he continued, \"By the time we got to the casino, the place was a war zone. We had three of the Tremors backed into a corner, but there was no sign of you or Darwin. Then I heard gunshots coming from behind us, when I turned to see what was happening, I saw the both of you. You hesitated, only for a second before you opened fire on us, purposely missing the agents, I guess Darwin was smarter than we thought and picked up on it, then he turned on you. I tried to get to you, but it was too late. He shot at you, you stepped back, lost your footing and fell down the stairwell. I didn't know you had got hit 'till I finally got to you. Darwin tried to keep me from getting to you, he came at me with his machetes when he ran out of bullets. I don't really know what happened after that, it was all a blur, but I managed to find you.\" His voice shook for a second, \"I thought you were dead, there was so much blood!\" By now, he was standing at the window, back to her. \"I thought to myself, I failed! Emma's dead because I couldn't protect her!\" She could hear the tears in his voice, even though she couldn't see his face. She went to speak, but was cut short, \"Em' I'm sorry! I should have done something, anything to keep you safe! I should have done more to keep you in Virginia!\" He turned to face her, the tears running down his cheek. It broke her heart to see him like this, \"Nic, it's not your fault! I screwed up, not you!\" Her eyes overflowed. He came to her, holding her to him, \"I'm sorry!\" He repeated. Emma pulled away slightly and looked up at him, wiping the tears from his face. \"You don't need to be sorry. I'm here because of my mistake, and besides, you know how hard headed I am, there was no way I was going to turn this case down, even if you tied me to the bed, I'd have figured out a way out of it!\" She grinned at him. He smiled back, knowing what she said was true, she would have went no matter what, \"So please stop blaming yourself for this! I'm fine, more or less, and when I get out of here, if it makes you feel better, you can be my personal man servant until I get better, K?\" He was about to respond when the door opened. Quickly dropping out of their embrace, Nicholas retook his place at the window, trying to dry up the last of the wetness on his cheeks. \"Well, well, look at you!\" Agent Baker replied as he entered the room. \"Not too bad considering what you went through!\" Emma smiled at him, 'Thanks Boss!\" \"I see you've had company!\" He nodded in Nicholas' direction, \"Nic, you look like shit! Go back to the hotel and get some rest, that's an order!\" He quickly glanced at Emma, who nodded, knowing full well that he wouldn't be gone for more than a few hours. \"Yes sir!\" He replied as he grabbed his coat. \"I'll come back later, K?\" She could see the pain in his eyes, he wanted to be with her in case something happened, so he could make up for the last time and protect her. \"You know, he really cares about you.\" Baker replied when the door closed. Emma tensed a bit, knowing that relationships between partners in the F.B.I where frowned on, but relaxed a little when she saw the smile on his face, \"He's a good kid!\" \"Yes, I know!\" \"So, how are you feeling?\" \"Not bad, seeing that I was shot twice then fell down a flight of stairs!\" She replied, as Baker, a man not much older than herself, maybe thirty, with dark curly hair and a goatee, took a seat beside her bed. \"So, can you tell me what happened?\" He asked, pulling a notepad and pen from his pocket. \"Not really, the doctor said I have a kind of amnesia, I can remember the day I left Virginia, but nothing after!\" \"I see, repression, not uncommon in these situations.\" He replied. \"Mmmhmm, so I've been told.\" She replied, \"The only things I know are what Nic told me. But the doctor said my memory will come back in time!\" \"Good, good! So Nicholas informed you that the Tremors escaped?\" \"Yes sir, he did.\" \"That's why I have so much security in the building. I'm sure they will try to get to you, if they think you survived. But don't worry, I have the best out there, Dom, Abrego, Porter. We won't let anything happen to one of my best!\" He grinned. The news was a bit unsettling, she knew the agents he had picked where indeed the best, but she also knew that the Tremors would eventually come for her, no matter what, and her friends would have to suffer along with her! \"Well, I'd better get going, let you get your rest. I've informed Agent Nicholas to update me on your condition. Take your time, rest and get better! We all miss you around the office!\" He smiled. \"Have a good evening sir!\" She replied as he exited the room. Moments after Baker left, the door opened. \"Nic, what are you still doing here? Baker told you to go home!\" She replied, a little ticked that he had disobeyed their lead agent, but was relieved that he was here with her again. \"I know, I can't go, I won't leave you alone! I'll sleep in that chair every night until your better if I have too, I don't care!\" He replied. \"I know you would, but you really need to get some rest, and seriously, you need a shower!\" She laughed, pinching her nose. \"Yeah, I guess you're right, O.K. I'm gonna go, but I'll be back in a few hours, I promise!\" He replied, \"I love you!\" He kissed her forehead. She knew all along that he had cared for her, but she hadn't known it was so deep until that last night in Quantico. He was so distraught that he couldn't change her mind, he'd sat her down, told her how he really felt about her, made love to her. In a way, he was hoping it would change her mind and in another, he did it because he thought it would be the last time he'd see her alive. And before that night, she hadn't known herself how much she really cared for him. \"Love you too stinky!\" She teased. \"Do you need anything before I go, or anything brought back?\" She thought hard about asking, \"Could you leave your gun?\" He stopped and looked at her, \"Em' there's plenty of security here, you won't…\" \"Please? Just for some peace of mind!\" She pleaded, without missing a beat, he unclipped the gun from its holster and handed it to her, with an extra clip. \"Thanks!\" She slipped it into the side table drawer. He nodded and gave her a small smile before he left. Emma awoke to something cold against her temple and the strong smell of weed and sweat. She knew before she opened her eyes that it was Darwin. \"Well, well, sleepin' beauty's awake!\" He replied in his thick southern drawl. I thank you's got sum e'splainin ta do, lil lady!\" He pulled her roughly from the bed, shoving her towards the window. \"Dar, what are you doing here?\" She stuttered, trying to regain some strength in her battered legs. \"Cum on naw, tha family's waitin' in tha car fer our lil reunion!\" He motioned the gun towards the window, \"Naw git!\" She stood her ground, \"I'm not going anywhere with you!\" She spat. He locked the gun, \"Well, I beg ta differ witcha ther'.\" \"No, if you're going to kill me, then do it here, now!\" She dared, 'What the hell are you doing?' Her sane mind screamed at her. \"Naw, thank I'll make yer by'friend find ya, piece by piece!\" He snarled, \"Naw git out that ther' winda before I throws ya out!\" She grabbed whatever she could, the gun was too far away, and threw it in Darwin's direction, hoping to get to the gun or the door. He came at her, \"Naw, I don' usually 'it women, but you jus' gone an' pissed me off!\" He backhanded her, causing her to hit the floor hard. He grabbed her by her hair and pulled her to her knees, she grabbed a bedpan and smacked him hard across the face, causing him to stumble backwards. She darted as best she could towards the door, when a sharp pain tore its way through her back and out her chest. She fell, hands to her chest, tears and blood smeared across her face, gasping for air. Darwin stood over her, looking down the barrel of his German officers pistol, \"I sure hate ta do this, but, it's tha' way of tha' world, beautiful!\" Then he pulled the trigger. Emma woke up with a scream, soaked in sweat, she frantically felt herself for new bullet wounds. She felt hands grab her by the shoulders and she screamed again. The door to her hospital room burst open and three agents rushed in. \"Em'! Em'! It's me, Nic!\" He replied, \"Its ok, guys!\" The agents put away their guns and left the room as Emma came to reality and hugged into Nicholas chest, sobbing uncontrollably. \"He came for me Nic!\" She sobbed, \"Darwin, he killed me!\" Nicholas held her tightly, stroking her hair, \"Sssshhhh, it's alright! It was just a dream! I'm not going to let anyone hurt you, I promise!\" \"It was so real. Nic, I could feel the gun against my skin, I could smell him! I felt the bullet hit me!\" She cried. \"It's ok, it's over now, you're ok!\" He whispered. He laid her back onto the pillow, but she refused to give up the death grip she had around his chest. So he lay there with her, whispering to her and placing tender kisses on her head until they both fell asleep. ... \"How fuckin' sweet!\" Kaitlyn replied, shoving the binoculars at Lester, who flicked them to his face. \"Yep, makes me wanna puke, it do!\" He replied, \"Well, you gonna tell Darwin she's awake 'n wit her lover boy?\" Lester flitted his eyelids at his half sister. \"Dammit Leester, grow a fuckin' spine!\" She smacked him hard on the back of his bald head, Go tell Dar' yerself!\" Lester, who looked as though he thoroughly enjoyed the beating, hopped out of the tree they where perched in and headed for the car, where a sleeping Darwin lay. On the way, he picked up a nice long stick, \"Darwin? Hey, Darwin!\" No response, so he up and poked his older brother with the stick, he knew after all these years, that when your waking Darwin, it's possible to get kicked or punched, so he'd choose a stick to poke him with from a safe distance! \"What tha' fuck Leester? Fuck! Wha's it?\" Darwin replied, groggily swatting his brother's attempts to wake him. \"She's awake Dar'!\" With that Darwin's eyes flicked open and he nearly tore the door from the car as he bolted towards Kaitlyn. \"Give me 'em!\" He snatched the binoculars from her hand. \"Ah, Dar' I don't thank ya wanna do tha…\" Kaitlyn trailed off. Darwin seethed with anger and he didn't know if it was because he hadn't killed the little narc in the first place or if it was because she was in the arms of another man! \"Fuckin' son of a bitch!\" \"What we gonna do?\" \"I dunno, right yet!\" He snapped. He punched the hood of the car as he stormed off, startling a sleeping Jeeves. \"Wha', wha's goin' on?\" Jeeves sleepily replied. Lester, who now took up a seat in the back, smacked his baby brother in the side of the head. \"Whacha thank is goin' on ya moron? Em's awake!\" \"Oh, can we go see her? I miss Em'!\" Jeeves received yet another whomp from his brother, \"Damnit Leester, stop hittin' me!\" \"Well, stop actin' like a damn idgit!\" \"All of ya, shut tha' hell up! Yer givin' me a migraine!\" Kaitlyn replied, sitting in the passenger's side of the car. \"Wha's he gunna do?\" Lester asked. \"I dunno Lees, I don't even know if he knows yet!\" Kaitlyn replied, \"Ther's a hell of a lot of security in that hospital!\" \"Hey, Dar! Darwin!\" Lester shouted, \"Naw, wher' do ya 'spose he's got ta?\" They all looked at one another, then took off for the tree. \"Give me them binoculars Leester!\" Kaitlyn replied, climbing back up the tree, \"I don't see 'im. Wher' tha' fuck did he go?\" \"Whacha all lookin' at?\" Darwin asked, leaning against the hood of the car. \"Wha? Dar! We was wonderin' wher' you got ta!\" Lester replied. \"Had ta take a piss!\" He shrugged a thumb over his shoulder. \"K, well, we're gonna git sum shut eye!\" Lester replied, pulling Jeeves along with him. Kaitlyn sauntered over to her brother, \"Wanna talk 'bout it?\" Her brother had changed drastically over the last few days, and she knew it was because of Em'. \"Naw, not really!\" He spat chewing tobacco through his teeth. \"Not right yet! Got a lot to figure first.\" Darwin had many girls in his life, but Em', she was different and he didn't know how to react to this treason! He thought there was something between them and then she stabbed him in the back. He was such an idiot, he should have seen right through her, but he was blinded. \"Dar' cum on, ya gotta git sum sleep!\" She replied, getting back into the car. \"Ya, be ther' in a bit!\" He was a torn man. His animal side wanted to blow her brains out, but the male inside, wanted to fuck them out! He just sat there for hours, staring into the sky, trying to sort himself out before he finally fell asleep. ... \"Good morning sunshine!\" Emma replied as her eyes fluttered open and fell on Nicholas face. \"Morning beautiful!\" He smiled, \"How are you feeling?\" \"Better.\" She replied, cuddling closer to his warm body. Then she let out a sigh, \"Mmmmm, comfy!\" She smiled. He chuckled at her, \"Me too!\" \"Don't move, ever, K?\" She snuggled in more. He laughed and kissed the top of her head. Then a knock came on the door, Emma groaned as Nicholas slid out of the bed, \"Come in!\" He replied. \"Good morning!\" A chipper young nurse replied as she entered the room. \"Morning!\" Emma groaned. \"How are you feeling today?\" \"Ok I guess.\" \"Well, that's good!\" The nurse replied. \"I'm gonna get some breakfast, be back in a bit, k?\" Nicholas replied. \"K.\" When Nicholas left the room, the nurse began to check Emma over. \"Well, it looks like your healing nicely!\" \"Does that mean I can go home soon?\" Emma asked anxiously. \"Oh, not yet I'm afraid! Maybe by the end of the week!\" She replied, removing the gauze on her back. \"But I think its safe enough for you to have a shower now, how does that sound?\" \"Oh my god, that sounds awesome!\" Emma replied, happy to be getting out of her bed. \"Your husband's been very worried about you, I bet he's glad your awake and doing well!\" \"My hus…Wha'?\" Emma stuttered, blushing, \"Nic? No, he's not my husband!\" \"Oh, sorry, it's just his concern for you, he came with you in the ambulance and I haven't seen him leave for more than a few minutes at a time!\" \"Yeah, he's my partner, we're very close!\" Emma replied. \"I see, well then, let's get you in that shower, shall we?\" The warm water running down her now swollen and bruised body felt like heaven, unfortunatley, her injuries kept her from enjoying this alone! The young nurse assisted with the showering, which was very awkward. When she was finished, she begged the nurse to let her do things on her own, she didn't like to be tended on much by strangers! \"Breakfast is here!\" Nicholas replied as he entered the room, \"Oh, shit! Sorry!\" Emma was standing by her bed, dressed in only her bra and panites. But he couldn't help but take another look before turning his head. He hadn't noticed before how banged up her body had been. She had bruises everywhere, along with some small cuts and two bullet wounds. But with all of that, she was still gorgeous, each of those marks made her even more beautiful to him, they showed how brave and strong she was. \"Well, it's not like you haven't seen me in less!\" She grinned, then she remembered the state her body was in and quickly pulled on some scrubs the nurse had left for her. \"You sure you're feeling alright?\" Nicholas asked, concerned now with her level of pain. \"Yeah, I'm even better now that I've had a shower!\" She sat back on the bed, \"So, what's for breakfast?\" \"Coffee and bagels! There's not a big selection in the cafeteria.\" \"What I wouldn't give for a Hava Java coffee right about now! I can't wait to get back home and sleep in my own bed!\" She sighed. \"I know, it won't be long and we'll be on a plane back to Virginia!\" \"Yeah, the nurse said probably by the end of the week, but I can't wait that long! I'm gonna go crazy in here, I can't even go outside of this room, let alone the building.\" ... \"Boy, 'ave you completely lost yer mind? You can't just waltz in ther' 'n take her out, one way 'er tha' other!\" Lester replied. \"Ya gotta figure out what yer' gonna do wit' 'er first!\" Kaitlyn replied, \"I sure don't know what I'd do in yer situation!\" \"I knows whut I'm gunna do!\" Darwin replied, sliding his goggles off of his face. \"I'm gunna go in ther' and bring her home!\" Flabergasted, Lester replied, \"Wha...What are you sayin' Dar', you'd risk bringing 'er back wit us? You can't be serious, she's FBI!\" \"Shut up Leester, I'll do whut I please!\" \"Dar', are ya sure this is whut ya wants?\" Kaitlyn asked. \"Yup.\" He stopped and looked his sister in the eyes, \"I luv 'er!\" Lester and Jeeves where about to burst into laughter at this, but decided to keep quiet with the look their older sister shot them. \"You two, git!\" She spat, shooing them away. \"Dar', I know you do, but Leester has a point, and do you really think she's gunna want to cum back wit us?\" \"She will, I know she will! She's one of us, Kait', she's a Tremor through 'n through!\" \"Dar', she's FBI, she's not one of us! Darlin', I miss her too, she was the sister I ne'er had! But, an' i hates ta say it fer a second time, Leester's right. We don't know if we can trust her again!\" Darwin just glared at his siblings. \"Fuck it, if yer out, yer out, but I'm goin'!\" He replied, grabbing his gear. The three looked at one another, then at Darwin's retreating back.

Please Review. Thanks. Warmth swept over her body as she moved in the tangle of white sheets. The sun was shinning brightly now. Making her blond curls come alive. Penny shook her head slowly not believing where she was. As she took a tentative step to get out of bed she wondered if it was all really happening. Was she in bed with this rock god? Panic started to fill her though, she promised she'd quit the game. But the whole gang had been in town, and when that voice had said \"Please Miss Penny Lane\", how could she say no? She was remembering last night, it was all coming back to her…… The Night Before Penny danced slowly backstage at the show, somehow by a miracle of god they'd managed to get Sabbath, Zeppelin, and the Stones to play on one lovely stage. She listened to the sound of the crowds screaming for these men who would soon come back stage and make her do some very naughty things. She had tried to stop playing this part, but when she had gotten that call from Sapphire and heard the lineup how could she refuse the ticket. So here she was moving a little bit faster, wearing a sparkly slip dress, barefoot, swaying to the sound. She had to say she truly loved the music. Each note hit her inside a way nothing else could. The boys were finishing up now and soon the chaos would ensue. She was ready for it however; years of groupie dome hadn't been wasted. She could hear them all filing in, she didn't stop dancing though. That was always the trick, pretend like you don't care, treat them like the milkman and then suddenly snap and remember your place just as they were about to through in the towel. Slowly she felt a hand on her back. Someone placing a drink in her hand, a coke with ice and lemon. \"For old times sake, darling\" he whispered as she took a sip. She seductively turned around, never stopping the dance, and took another drink. \"Don't you think I'm old enough to have a real drink, yet?\" She drawled into his ear. \"You, sweetheart, are old enough to have whatever you want\" \"Well in that case….\" She leaned in and new there was no hope, the game would continue. That's all she remembered from the night before once you add the mad dash to the hotel room and the cold sheets. Penny snuck into the shower, hoping to get out before it was to late. She wanted to be gone before he woke up. Luckily for her the man always slept in late. Just as she finished getting dressed and was about to make a dash for the door a hand grabbed hers. \"You aren't planning on leaving so fast are you? Miss Penny Lane, please, please don't leave yet we've just began?\" The dark voice told her in his commanding tone. She was once again pulled into the hotel room where she would spend the next week until she finally disappeared once and for all, or so everyone thought including her self. She had spent a week of bliss with the boy who brought her into the world that had been her life for so many years. Now at sixteen she quit. 12 months later Penny walked gradually along the park trail pushing the stroller. She had gone, that was true, but she now had a part of her old life to keep with her forever. A living memento of days gone by, whether for good or bad. She hoped no one would ever find out about her little secret or she would be in a world of trouble, once again. Okay that's the end of the first chapter. Hope you enjoyed. I may write another chapter depending on whether you guys want one or not. Thanks for reading it. Please review.[Chapter 2] She sits there.nCurls in a bundle, blowing softly across her neck.

Lane disappeared fromnthe rock n' roll world 3 years ago, leaving behind her wild ways.nLane has had multiple songs written about her by such artists as LednZeppelin, Black Sabbath, the Beatles, Stillwater, Gram Parsons, thenWho and the Rolling Stones. She currently lives in Los Angeles,nCalifornia. She is 19 years old. RS: So Penny Lane, isnit? Now, if words correct you've been gone from the rock world fornalmost 3 years. Why is that? The good times turn bad? PL: I was told thatnWilliam Miller was to be conducting the interview. Now I don't meannto be impolite, but I agreed to this under the conditions that henwould do it. If he's not going to be here then I'd prefer not tondo it. RS: UnfortunatelynWilliam had to go home for some type of family emergency. He warnednme that you may be hesitant to do the interview. But he promises thatnhe is going to review all the information and publish only what henfeels to be appropriate. Also he has allowed, why I don't know,nthat you will have to sign off on the story before it's published.nThereby allowing for you to choose what is printed. PL: Well in that case.nI guess I'll continue. Let's see, you asked why I left the world.nWell I just had other priorities that were more important to me thenna party and another long flight across the globe. RS: What prioritiesnwould that be? PL: I'd prefer not tondisclose that at the time. RS: Later perhaps then.nHow would you describe your time traveling with some of the greatestnrock bands in history? PL: Magical while itnlasted. I wouldn't want to do it again though. I was young then andndidn't have very many cares. There is an aura of freedom whilenyou're on the road with your favorite band. That all is possible,nthis crazy vibe of excitement. It's all very liberating. Maybe toonmuch so. RS: Your only 19, ifnI'm correct. Not old at all. Now let's see. What was yournfavorite moment being a groupie? Any one time that pops in your mind. PL: That a very hardnquestion. There were a lot of good times. The moment's rights afterna show finished were always the best. The excitement that filledneveryone, the things they'd do. Madness. RS: What kind ofnthings? PL: Some shocking, somennot. Just depends what you're used to. Mostly a lot of drugs andnbooze. Makes people do some silly things. I'd prefer not to revealntoo many details, though. Not my place. Wouldn't want them talkingnabout some of the things I've done. RS: Come on just tellnme one story. PL: Fine I'll givenyou a story but its going to disappoint. Once while on tour with thenbig bad stones, we went to a local park near the gig they werensupposed to play in Atlanta. While there we crashed a 5 yr old girl'snbirthday party. Her name was Melinda, I believe. Well Mick and Keithnhad brought their guitars with them so they spent the whole entirenday singing nursery rhymes to all the kids there. It was awesomenseeing these big \"scary\" musicians with unicorns painted on theirnfaces singing kiddy songs. RS: That doesn'tnsound too exciting. PL: See that's thenthing about the scene. Yah there are all these wild and crazynparties, but it's the small mellow things you remember. Partiesnhave a tendency of blending after awhile. It all starts to become thensame thing. RS: Now Penny, I'mnafraid I am going to try and ask that question one more time. Why didnyou leave the rock n' roll world? PL: If it's thatnimportant to you to know. Here it is. I had a child.

","Summary":" Miss Penny Lane, Please A/N: Hey everyone hope you enjoy this story, its one of my favorite movies "},{"Movie":"Pianist","Title":"The Idiot, Fiodor Dovstoiesky","Author":"LeighPancakes","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718379","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I glance around the living room, still half-asleep. Wladek and Papa are sleeping in their little beds, while I am wide awake. I know none of my family members will start with their day to day affairs until at least seven o'clock. I look at my worn leather belt watch, from the old times in which I was a writer. But now I know I can't do that for a living, I sell my books down in the streets. It feels like a sore pain in my chest whenever I sell one of them, my companions in dreams and adventures since I was a kid, but I don't know better than that. I sell very little anyway, and Mama and Papa need every single zloty me and my siblings earn from our jobs to keep on living. Half past six. I will never admit it, but I feel lucky about having a pianist brother. Were it not for Wladek, we would have very well starved to death by now. He's the one who brings real money to the Szpilman household, even if I don't like it. What does piss me about his job is the fact that he plays for the ghetto parasites, those who profit themselves from smuggling and don't give a damn about poor peoples' suffering. I always feel how my teeth clench and my knuckles go white when I see one of those so-called rich Jews walking around the ghetto, their heads up in a superiority menace and their eyes practically smirking at beggars for being poor. Papa says it's because I'm a Socialist, but I can't help it. I slowly get out of my bed and change into my usual outfit: a worn shirt and suspender pants, along with my always-present brown cap. Back when we lived outside the ghetto, I used to wear my hair well combed and with hair gel, but now I'm just a poor bookseller I wear what I can. I look outside, it seems like it's going to be a cold day. It's January 1941. We've been trapped inside this mousetrap for three months. I sometimes think we will never leave, we will never trespass the ghetto's walls again. If only I had known...if only we had left Warsaw in time. That would have given us time. We would have gone to the north and we would have taken a boat to England. Wladek and I can handle English, and the others would learn quickly. We would live in peace, not in this hell we call our everyday life. My stomach roars, but I prefer not to eat anything and save it for my family, they need it more than I do. I'm the youngest man in the family, after all. I'm twenty-four and I'm not growing. I might pluck some bread from a street baker later on. And of course I will not use my money to buy food for myself. I already gain little money – three zloty or less a day, probably – and I don't want to waste it on bread only I will enjoy. I get the basket I use to carry all of my books, with exception of one of them: The Merchant of Venice. Why? Because it was the first Shakespeare play I ever read, back when I was thirteen, and because our situation – the situation of Jews oppressed by Nazis all over Poland and Germany – is very well described in one of Shylock's soliloques. I know it by heart from reading it so many times. As I look at Shakespeare's portrait on the old cover of my eleven-year-old paperback, I smile. I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, heal'd by the same means, warm'd and cool'd by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, do we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. As I finish humming the soliloque once again, I, Henryk Szpilman, realize something. We must revenge. Jews must rebel against Nazis, take what is ours back and bring peace and equality back to our country. They are invasors, after all. They've wronged us for a year now, and I suspect they still will until someone stops him. And why shouldn't that someone be us, the Jews? I shake my head. The part of me who's into politics and longs for the Jewish liberation, the one that usually gets me into trouble, tells me to do something about this oppressive situation, but my poet, writer part tells me war won't be eradicated with more war. As the two sides of my personality battle for a certain idea inside my brain, I try to focus on getting some of my books inside the basket. When I'm done, I grab hold of it carefully. It's heavy and too big for a single person to carry it, I don't know how I'm going to reach the big ghetto without any help. Wladek usually helps me when he finishes working at Cafe Stuzka, and every night tells me to wake him up in the morning to help me carry the books to the place I usually stand at. But I just don't want to bother my older brother. It's fun to think how he was the one who protected me back when we were kids, when now I'm the tougher one, while he's just a silent man who tries to play piano for a living. I grab my jacket and my scarf from the chair I use as a hanger. I have a pair of gloves, but they're torn and some of the fingers are broken. Mama told me Halina and her would mend them in no time, but for the time being I have no gloves to wear for a tough day in the outside. We've never been through such a hard winter, without our usual coats, hats, gloves and scarves. The girls even have to share a coat, since Halina's got stolen from her hands by a beggar when she had taken it off in the entrance of a shop. Regina always scolds her for being so absent-minded, while Mama just sighs and says we'll save up some money for a new coat. I'm about to start a long journey to the big ghetto. I try to catch a good hold of the basket, but it's hard. I hear the books inside moving slowly. I hope they aren't too noisy, because I don't want to wake up my family. As I approach the front door, I hear a voice that I immediatly recognize. \"Henryk?\" I turn around to find my brother Wladek with his green eyes wide open. His big hook nose lets out a heavy sigh, with the help of his mouth. He blinks a couple of times, and then yawns quietly. \"Go back to sleep,\" I hiss. \"I'll help you,\" he says. \"You know it's too heavy for you to carry it all the way to the big ghetto.\" \"I've done it plenty of times,\" I answer, feeling rather offended. \"I can handle it by myself.\" \"Hold on,\" Wladek doesn't seem to hear me, because he jumps out of bed and gets himself dressed into a shirt, pants, tie and his coat. He's lucky, he has a coat. I just have this stupid jacket. Oh, and look at that ridiculous tie. He wears it because the parasites of the ghetto want him to. Pathetic. And look at that hat! Does he want to pretend he's still rich or what? I think Wladek hasn't quite assumed we're poor now because – \"Ready?\" my brother asks, grabbing hold of one of the sides of the basket. I just grunt and nod. \"But be quiet. I don't want Papa and Mama to wake up.\" Wladek nods and smirks as we walk out of our house, \"Sure thing, Henryk.\" I must admit, my brother does help when it comes to carrying the book basket to the big ghetto. Well, four hands are stronger than two. Not that I'll tell him anyway. \"Thanks,\" I mumble as I open the basket. \"You're welcome,\" Wladek answers. \"Do you want me to stay for a while? Yehuda's house is just ten minutes away from here and he expects me to be there at eight.\" I shake my head. My brother has done enough for today. I'll spend the next nine hours standing in the snow, with two copies of random books in my hands, yelling for the public, \"Dovstoieski! Shakespeare! Tolstoy! Kafka! Dickens! Dante Alighieri!\" without anyone really paying attention to me, except from one or two wealthy teenagers and a couple of girls who would smirk at me – the bravest ones daring to wink an eye at me. Only a couple of elder men would approach and really pay attention to my books. Most of the days I didn't sell anything. Other times, I sold one book or two, although this was really rare. Selling three would be a of miracle. I'd never sold any more than two books the same day, and this had only happened once, one of the first days in the ghetto, after I quitted trying to get a good job and started sellings my books in the street. I firstly started in our ghetto, the small ghetto, but then I realized all of the small ghetto citizens travel around the big ghetto daily, whilst in the big ghetto there are many more inhabitants – usually poorer, but who says poverty denies literary hunger? – and I thought I would sell more books by travelling there every morning. I was partly right and, after three months, I was surprised to see I had only sold eighteen books. I had imagined I would ultimately run out of books, but seeing I've sold an average of eight books per month and considering the collection of more than two hundred books by joining all of our familiar cooking books, novels and essays (plus the books I've stolen from here and there), I think my bussiness will be running for a while until we get out of books. Still, I can't help but worry someday I'll run out of books and I won't have anything to do for a living. I see a wealthy man approaching me, so I start yelling again. \"Dovstoiesky!\" I cry. \" The Idiot , by Fiodor Dovstoiesky!\" It's now five o'clock and I've only sold one book in ten hours I've been standing here. Fantastic. And it had to be The Idiot . I should have just torn the title off and stuck it to my head. I'm just an idiot for standing here doing nothing for hours, while I could be helping my family out of our pathetic situation. I grunt as I hold two new books in my hands: The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri and The Prince by Nicolas Maquiavelo. Pedestrians don't even glance at me, even though I yell the titles and a variety of authors I have in my basket. At twelve o'clock, for a so-called lunch, I plucked a glazed croissant from the baker in the other side of the street, not having any money with me. After enjoying a brief but stomach-fulling meal – over the past months I have learned to fill myself with as little food as possible – I went back to selling, and I finally found a young man, around the age of twenty years, who bought my The Idiot copy for three zloty. And that's all I've done for today. I hold the books in my hands, wondering if any citizen of the ghetto will ever notice I'm standing there. Doesn't seem likely. I watch how a familiar figure approaches me, waving in the middle of the crowd. I raise my hand too. It's Wladek. He must be done with his job for today, so I guess we'll be heading back home for diner. \"Hello, Henryk,\" he greets me as I place the two books inside the basket. \"Hi,\" I answer coldly. I bet he's been feeling warm all the day long, inside that lame cafe, while I've been freezing in the snowy street for hours without complaining. Just as we always do, each of us picks up a side of the basket and we start carrying it back home in silence. None of us speaks, we don't need to, I don't want to. I just look to the front to make sure I don't trip over a dead corpse or get pushed by the flow of passengers and pickpocketers who are so usual in our ghetto. \"Have you sold anything today?\" Wladek asks finally. \"Just one,\" I answer. \"Dovstoiesky, The Idiot . Three zlotys.\" I look to the front again and I can't see Wladek's face, but I know he's murmuring, \"better than yesterday.\" We reach the train railway. A train is passing by right now, so we're stopped by some Gestapo officials. If I hate anyone more than the ghetto parasites, that's the Gestapo. They're reckless with us, and wouldn't care less if we live or die. When we arrive, a man is mumbling to himself about how idiot Germans are. I have to agree with him in silence. Then I watch in silence a shocking scene. Some Gestapo officials are looking at a couple of Jews with looks of grim and contempt, with their rifles in their hands. At one point, they order a young couple to start dancing to the music some street musicians are playing. They can't do anything but obey. I start to feel rather ticked off, and I feel Wladek's hand over my shoulder. I realize my knuckles have gone white. \"Calm down, Henryk,\" he tells me. I shudder, but I stare at the scene. They're bringing a variety of couples to dance in front of them – to humilliate us, to wrong us. They hit them gently with their rifle as they chuckle in German, \"Faster, Jew!\" and they laugh at the dancing, humilliated Jews, pointing at the ones they consider the funniest. I have to close my eyes to prevent myself from yelling, screaming or punching someone. When I open my eyes again, the train is gone and we're allowed to move once again. When we arrive to our tiny house, both Wladek and I feel exhausted. We leave the book basket in the small, ridiculous hall and are soon met by Mama, who comes from the living room. \"Wladek, Henryk,\" she says as a greeting. \"Itzak Heller is waiting for you.\" Wladek and I share questioning glances, while Mama just shrugs and walks into the living room. We both walk inside and see Papa is standing next to the sofa, while Itzak Heller, chief of the Jewish Police of our ghetto, is sitting in our table, drinking some alcohol he's probably brought with him. \"What's happening?\" I ask coldly. I've never liked Heller very much, nor do I like his Jewish Police. \"Boys, sit down,\" she tells us. \"I'll go prepare some tea...\" Mama disappears inside the kitchen. I go to my chair and leave my hat, scarf and coat, and Wladek does the same. Then, I walk into the kitchen without even bothering to glance at Heller. \"Well, what are you here for?\" I ask dryly. Heller rolls his eyes and Papa stands there without saying anything. \"He's brought pastry,\" Papa tells us. \"His father is back to the jewelry business... it's going well, right Itzak?\" Heller rolls his eyes at Papa, while Wladek just stands there in the doorway, not saying or doing anything at all. I get myself a glass of water from the kitchen and as I walk by Heller once again, he says, \"We're recruiting people.\" I sit down on the sofa and look at him blankly, stating that I don't really care about it. Me in the Jewish Police. Rather beg in the streets. \"Trains are coming from all over Poland bringing Jews from dozens of cities,\" he continues. \"In no time, we'll be more than a million Jews in the ghetto. We need more Jewish policemen.\" I look at the ceiling with a sarcastic smile in my face. \"Ah, I see,\" I say, my voice dripping with sarcasm. \"You want me to beat up Jews and catch the Gestapo spirit.\" \"Someone has to do it,\" Heller replies, shrugging. \"But why me?\" I ask. \"I thought you only recruited boys from rich families. I mean, look at me, look at us...\" \"Yes, I've thought of you, that's why I came,\" Itzak Heller replies, his brow now furrowed. \"Your family could have a better life. Do you want to keep living from the books you sell in the streets?\" I take a long sip from my glass water and give Heller another long, sarcastic smile. \"Yes, please,\" I ask, sarcasm filling my vocal chords once more. Heller scoffs, \"I'm trying to do you a favor.\" As he sees I'm a lost cause, he turns over to Wladek with a persuading smile. \"What about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. In the police we have a jazz band, and I'm sure they'd love you to join them. Come on, sign up. You don't have a job.\" \"Thanks,\" my brother answers, always so polite. \"But I do have a job.\" Itzak Heller looks at us with exasperation written in his face. He just shakes his head and gets his cap, and storms out of our house. I sit in the sofa, taking long sips from my glass of water, while Wladek stands in the doorway. Papa turns at me and furrows his brow angrily. \"Why have you done that, Henryk?\" he asks. \"You shouldn't have been so rude to Itzak. He's offered you a job! Weren't you looking for one?\" \"Not that type of job, Papa,\" I say. \"Not that type of job.\" Papa sighs and just walks into the kitchen, exasperated. Wladek sits next to me and stares at the wall. \"You did well, Henryk, no matter what Papa tells you,\" he assures me. \"You're a good man, you won't go around beating up people...\" I nod as I leave the glass of water aside. I release a long, peaceful sigh. After this conversation with Heller, selling books in the streets for the rest of my life does seem like a tempting option.

So I wrote about it. Disclaimer: I am not writing about the 'real' people, I am writing about their characters as portrayed in the movie (The Pianist). I do not own the plot, characters, or anything of that sort. I am not looking to make a profit off of this story. The song that I listened to on repeat while writing this story: The Piano - Michael Nyman Every time he placed his fingers upon those ivory keys, a calm would wash over him. The music would always soothe his nerves, no matter what was happening around him. A bomb could be threatening his life (as they had seemed to be doing quite frequently) and he would continue to play with such passion that his fingers would ache with the strain. Yet, the audience would always think that he played with ease. Usually he did, since years of vigorous training had left his hands able to play for hours on end. He could remember being five years old, playing scales up and down the keys for two hours straight. No one in his house had wanted to hear another C scale for as long as they lived. Most of the time his family was supportive of his choice of career. Being a pianist for the Warsaw radio was nothing to scoff at. Yet Henryk (his brother) tended to yell at him when he composed late into the night. \"Stop playing the fucking piano Wladek! That noise is not a masterpiece!\" Of course it wasn't a masterpiece. At least, not yet. Composing was his favourite thing to do. As he wrote his notes upon paper he envisioned years of pianists playing his music to crowds of eager people. The love of music was what he desperately wanted to pass on. That day many things had happened to Wladek. He had been playing piano at the station when a bomb had gone off. Moments later he had run into the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life. And now, he was sitting in front of his worn yet tenderly cared for piano: hands shaking. Their future was leaning over a cliff, watching the waves crash against the rocks below. Their footing was threatened by the push of the Nazi's at any second. No Jew knew what was to happen, but they all tried to keep their heads high. Persecution of the Jews was nothing new and everyone hoped that it would pass over quickly. Of course, it wasn't just the Jews who were being killed. It was everyone who happened to not be of the pure Aryan race. The murders were unspeakably horrid; the papers were censored with propaganda. Wladek sighed and pushed his fingers into the keys of his piano, listening to the unorganized sound of crushed notes. \"What are you doing?\" He turned his head to the doorway where the silhouette of a man was standing. Henryk, his only and most stubborn brother was leaning against the doorframe, staring at him in fake annoyance. Wladek could tell that he wanted to talk, but they had never been very adept at communication, (being brought up as emotion concealing males). \"Trying to play piano.\" \"Then play.\" \"It's difficult.\" Henryk walked to the corner of the room by the front window, sitting down in an armchair. He stretched out and scratched his head. Wladek could tell that he hadn't slept in awhile from the dark bags under his eyes. He knew that Henryk had been stressing about the money situation lately. \"I've heard that they want to put us into ghettos soon.\" Henryk said solemnly, turning his head towards the window and staring blankly into the street. It was dark outside and the lights were beginning to turn out in the neighbour's houses. Wladek didn't reply to his comment. Instead he plucked out a simple tune with his left hand. \"Mom's going to sleep.\" Henryk then said. There was an uncomfortable silence. \"What do you want Henryk?\" \"I hear you're becoming friendly with Dorota.\" Wladek turned to face his brother, leaning his back against the keys. \"She's a very beautiful woman.\" He replied, picturing her face in his mind. She played the cello…. They could play wonderful duets together. \"Yes, but she's also blonde haired and blue eyed.\" \"What does that matter?\" \"She'll get hurt for being with you Wladek.\" Wladek closed his eyes slowly, rubbing his fingertips against his temple. Of course he knew that, but he couldn't help picture the future that they could have. If only… if only he weren't a Jew. \"I know.\" He replied, turning back and closing the cover over the keys. \"How about you, do you have a woman in mind yet?\" Henryk smiled, his eyes twinkling for just a second, \"You know me, I always have a woman in mind. It's just the commitment that I lack.\" \"Maybe that's a good thing.\" Henryk perked his head up at this comment and then leaned forward in his chair. \"What do you mean?\" Wladek couldn't help it, the thought of ravaging a woman for a night sounded like a good idea. At least when it came to Dorota it did. \"Brother to brother,\" he began, speaking slightly softer so as his parents wouldn't overhear, \"it sounds like a nice idea to have Dorota for a night and then leave to the ghetto. She would be better off, and I wouldn't be left wondering what it would be like.\" He could tell that Henryk was feeling slightly uncomfortable of the subject matter, but it was obviously something that they could both relate to. Who knew if they would survive this war? They might as well discuss as much as possible in the time being. \"Then do it Wladek, take her out for dinner and seduce her. It should be easy for you, since you already seem to have her falling head over heels.\" \"But… I'm not that type of man.\" Henryk nodded his head and then placed it in his hands, scratching his head once more. \"You're right. You're a better man than me.\" \"If you could only hear my thoughts Henryk.\" Wladek said with a chuckle. Henryk cracked a smile. \"We must be brothers after all.\" Henryk said, breaking out into a deep laughter. Wladek joined in, wiping the corners of his eyes where tears had slipped through. \"Be quiet down there!\" a female voice shouted from up above. Both brothers became silent at once, holding back their laughter as best they could. \"I still say that you should seduce her. Except… in your own sort of way. Don't go into it thinking: \"She will sleep with me tonight\". Think… \"We will fall in love tonight\". She'll never be able to resist you brother, especially with your hands.\" Wladek chuckled, holding his hands out in front of him. Long spidery fingers that girls used to find repulsive in elementary were now considered an asset in his adult life. How things changed. He sighed, placing his hands back at his side. He felt like confessing in the midst of all of this already controversial talk. \"I've never slept with a woman.\" Henryk made no movement, his eyes staring at the floor. \"I've figured as much,\" he replied in a surprisingly serious voice, \"see, you are the better man Wladek.\" \"I'm the more foolish man if you ask me.\" There was a silence once more, but this time it wasn't uncomfortable. It was pensive. \"Do you love her?\" \"I think… I might.\" \"Then tell her. Start your life before it's too late.\" \"I'm afraid.\" \"Don't be, she won't reject you.\" But rejection was the last thing on Wladek's mind. He was more afraid of what could happen. What if she became pregnant and he was put into a ghetto? She would be convicted of having relations with a Jew. She would be killed. So as the two brothers said goodnight and Wladek lay in bed, he decided that he would not seduce Dorota. She would stay his friend, and nothing more. The bed squeaked as he moved his hand beneath the covers, reaching his fingers out to grasp the heat that abode there. He caressed himself like he imagined she would. He imagined that his seduction had succeeded. He made love to Dorota without the consequences.

This is my first Pianist story, 'The Idiot, Fiodor Dovstoiesky', it's just about a day of Henryk's life in the ghetto. Enjoy! =) ... ... ... I glance around the living room, still half-asleep. Wladek and Papa are sleeping in their little beds, while I am wide awake. I know none of my family members will start with their day to day affairs until at least seven o'clock. I look at my worn leather belt watch, from the old times in which I was a writer. But now I know I can't do that for a living, I sell my books down in the streets. It feels like a sore pain in my chest whenever I sell one of them, my companions in dreams and adventures since I was a kid, but I don't know better than that. I sell very little anyway, and Mama and Papa need every single zloty me and my siblings earn from our jobs to keep on living. Half past six. I will never admit it, but I feel lucky about having a pianist brother. Were it not for Wladek, we would have very well starved to death by now. He's the one who brings real money to the Szpilman household, even if I don't like it. What does piss me about his job is the fact that he plays for the ghetto parasites, those who profit themselves from smuggling and don't give a damn about poor peoples' suffering. I always feel how my teeth clench and my knuckles go white when I see one of those so-called rich Jews walking around the ghetto, their heads up in a superiority menace and their eyes practically smirking at beggars for being poor. Papa says it's because I'm a Socialist, but I can't help it. I slowly get out of my bed and change into my usual outfit: a worn shirt and suspender pants, along with my always-present brown cap. Back when we lived outside the ghetto, I used to wear my hair well combed and with hair gel, but now I'm just a poor bookseller I wear what I can. I look outside, it seems like it's going to be a cold day. It's January 1941. We've been trapped inside this mousetrap for three months. I sometimes think we will never leave, we will never trespass the ghetto's walls again. If only I had known...if only we had left Warsaw in time. That would have given us time. We would have gone to the north and we would have taken a boat to England. Wladek and I can handle English, and the others would learn quickly. We would live in peace, not in this hell we call our everyday life. My stomach roars, but I prefer not to eat anything and save it for my family, they need it more than I do. I'm the youngest man in the family, after all. I'm twenty-four and I'm not growing. I might pluck some bread from a street baker later on. And of course I will not use my money to buy food for myself. I already gain little money – three zloty or less a day, probably – and I don't want to waste it on bread only I will enjoy. I get the basket I use to carry all of my books, with exception of one of them: The Merchant of Venice. Why? Because it was the first Shakespeare play I ever read, back when I was thirteen, and because our situation – the situation of Jews oppressed by Nazis all over Poland and Germany – is very well described in one of Shylock's soliloques. I know it by heart from reading it so many times. As I look at Shakespeare's portrait on the old cover of my eleven-year-old paperback, I smile. I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, heal'd by the same means, warm'd and cool'd by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, do we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. As I finish humming the soliloque once again, I, Henryk Szpilman, realize something. We must revenge. Jews must rebel against Nazis, take what is ours back and bring peace and equality back to our country. They are invasors, after all. They've wronged us for a year now, and I suspect they still will until someone stops him. And why shouldn't that someone be us, the Jews? I shake my head. The part of me who's into politics and longs for the Jewish liberation, the one that usually gets me into trouble, tells me to do something about this oppressive situation, but my poet, writer part tells me war won't be eradicated with more war. As the two sides of my personality battle for a certain idea inside my brain, I try to focus on getting some of my books inside the basket. When I'm done, I grab hold of it carefully. It's heavy and too big for a single person to carry it, I don't know how I'm going to reach the big ghetto without any help. Wladek usually helps me when he finishes working at Cafe Stuzka, and every night tells me to wake him up in the morning to help me carry the books to the place I usually stand at. But I just don't want to bother my older brother. It's fun to think how he was the one who protected me back when we were kids, when now I'm the tougher one, while he's just a silent man who tries to play piano for a living. I grab my jacket and my scarf from the chair I use as a hanger. I have a pair of gloves, but they're torn and some of the fingers are broken. Mama told me Halina and her would mend them in no time, but for the time being I have no gloves to wear for a tough day in the outside. We've never been through such a hard winter, without our usual coats, hats, gloves and scarves. The girls even have to share a coat, since Halina's got stolen from her hands by a beggar when she had taken it off in the entrance of a shop. Regina always scolds her for being so absent-minded, while Mama just sighs and says we'll save up some money for a new coat. I'm about to start a long journey to the big ghetto. I try to catch a good hold of the basket, but it's hard. I hear the books inside moving slowly. I hope they aren't too noisy, because I don't want to wake up my family. As I approach the front door, I hear a voice that I immediatly recognize. \"Henryk?\" I turn around to find my brother Wladek with his green eyes wide open. His big hook nose lets out a heavy sigh, with the help of his mouth. He blinks a couple of times, and then yawns quietly. \"Go back to sleep,\" I hiss. \"I'll help you,\" he says. \"You know it's too heavy for you to carry it all the way to the big ghetto.\" \"I've done it plenty of times,\" I answer, feeling rather offended. \"I can handle it by myself.\" \"Hold on,\" Wladek doesn't seem to hear me, because he jumps out of bed and gets himself dressed into a shirt, pants, tie and his coat. He's lucky, he has a coat. I just have this stupid jacket. Oh, and look at that ridiculous tie. He wears it because the parasites of the ghetto want him to. Pathetic. And look at that hat! Does he want to pretend he's still rich or what? I think Wladek hasn't quite assumed we're poor now because – \"Ready?\" my brother asks, grabbing hold of one of the sides of the basket. I just grunt and nod. \"But be quiet. I don't want Papa and Mama to wake up.\" Wladek nods and smirks as we walk out of our house, \"Sure thing, Henryk.\" I must admit, my brother does help when it comes to carrying the book basket to the big ghetto. Well, four hands are stronger than two. Not that I'll tell him anyway. \"Thanks,\" I mumble as I open the basket. \"You're welcome,\" Wladek answers. \"Do you want me to stay for a while? Yehuda's house is just ten minutes away from here and he expects me to be there at eight.\" I shake my head. My brother has done enough for today. I'll spend the next nine hours standing in the snow, with two copies of random books in my hands, yelling for the public, \"Dovstoieski! Shakespeare! Tolstoy! Kafka! Dickens! Dante Alighieri!\" without anyone really paying attention to me, except from one or two wealthy teenagers and a couple of girls who would smirk at me – the bravest ones daring to wink an eye at me. Only a couple of elder men would approach and really pay attention to my books. Most of the days I didn't sell anything. Other times, I sold one book or two, although this was really rare. Selling three would be a of miracle. I'd never sold any more than two books the same day, and this had only happened once, one of the first days in the ghetto, after I quitted trying to get a good job and started sellings my books in the street. I firstly started in our ghetto, the small ghetto, but then I realized all of the small ghetto citizens travel around the big ghetto daily, whilst in the big ghetto there are many more inhabitants – usually poorer, but who says poverty denies literary hunger? – and I thought I would sell more books by travelling there every morning. I was partly right and, after three months, I was surprised to see I had only sold eighteen books. I had imagined I would ultimately run out of books, but seeing I've sold an average of eight books per month and considering the collection of more than two hundred books by joining all of our familiar cooking books, novels and essays (plus the books I've stolen from here and there), I think my bussiness will be running for a while until we get out of books. Still, I can't help but worry someday I'll run out of books and I won't have anything to do for a living. I see a wealthy man approaching me, so I start yelling again. \"Dovstoiesky!\" I cry. \" The Idiot , by Fiodor Dovstoiesky!\" It's now five o'clock and I've only sold one book in ten hours I've been standing here. Fantastic. And it had to be The Idiot . I should have just torn the title off and stuck it to my head. I'm just an idiot for standing here doing nothing for hours, while I could be helping my family out of our pathetic situation. I grunt as I hold two new books in my hands: The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri and The Prince by Nicolas Maquiavelo. Pedestrians don't even glance at me, even though I yell the titles and a variety of authors I have in my basket. At twelve o'clock, for a so-called lunch, I plucked a glazed croissant from the baker in the other side of the street, not having any money with me. After enjoying a brief but stomach-fulling meal – over the past months I have learned to fill myself with as little food as possible – I went back to selling, and I finally found a young man, around the age of twenty years, who bought my The Idiot copy for three zloty. And that's all I've done for today. I hold the books in my hands, wondering if any citizen of the ghetto will ever notice I'm standing there. Doesn't seem likely. I watch how a familiar figure approaches me, waving in the middle of the crowd. I raise my hand too. It's Wladek. He must be done with his job for today, so I guess we'll be heading back home for diner. \"Hello, Henryk,\" he greets me as I place the two books inside the basket. \"Hi,\" I answer coldly. I bet he's been feeling warm all the day long, inside that lame cafe, while I've been freezing in the snowy street for hours without complaining. Just as we always do, each of us picks up a side of the basket and we start carrying it back home in silence. None of us speaks, we don't need to, I don't want to. I just look to the front to make sure I don't trip over a dead corpse or get pushed by the flow of passengers and pickpocketers who are so usual in our ghetto. \"Have you sold anything today?\" Wladek asks finally. \"Just one,\" I answer. \"Dovstoiesky, The Idiot . Three zlotys.\" I look to the front again and I can't see Wladek's face, but I know he's murmuring, \"better than yesterday.\" We reach the train railway. A train is passing by right now, so we're stopped by some Gestapo officials. If I hate anyone more than the ghetto parasites, that's the Gestapo. They're reckless with us, and wouldn't care less if we live or die. When we arrive, a man is mumbling to himself about how idiot Germans are. I have to agree with him in silence.

I start to feel rather ticked off, and I feel Wladek's hand over my shoulder. I realize my knuckles have gone white. \"Calm down, Henryk,\" he tells me. I shudder, but I stare at the scene. They're bringing a variety of couples to dance in front of them – to humilliate us, to wrong us. They hit them gently with their rifle as they chuckle in German, \"Faster, Jew!\" and they laugh at the dancing, humilliated Jews, pointing at the ones they consider the funniest. I have to close my eyes to prevent myself from yelling, screaming or punching someone. When I open my eyes again, the train is gone and we're allowed to move once again. When we arrive to our tiny house, both Wladek and I feel exhausted. We leave the book basket in the small, ridiculous hall and are soon met by Mama, who comes from the living room. \"Wladek, Henryk,\" she says as a greeting. \"Itzak Heller is waiting for you.\" Wladek and I share questioning glances, while Mama just shrugs and walks into the living room. We both walk inside and see Papa is standing next to the sofa, while Itzak Heller, chief of the Jewish Police of our ghetto, is sitting in our table, drinking some alcohol he's probably brought with him. \"What's happening?\" I ask coldly. I've never liked Heller very much, nor do I like his Jewish Police. \"Boys, sit down,\" she tells us. \"I'll go prepare some tea...\" Mama disappears inside the kitchen. I go to my chair and leave my hat, scarf and coat, and Wladek does the same. Then, I walk into the kitchen without even bothering to glance at Heller. \"Well, what are you here for?\" I ask dryly. Heller rolls his eyes and Papa stands there without saying anything. \"He's brought pastry,\" Papa tells us. \"His father is back to the jewelry business... it's going well, right Itzak?\" Heller rolls his eyes at Papa, while Wladek just stands there in the doorway, not saying or doing anything at all. I get myself a glass of water from the kitchen and as I walk by Heller once again, he says, \"We're recruiting people.\" I sit down on the sofa and look at him blankly, stating that I don't really care about it. Me in the Jewish Police. Rather beg in the streets. \"Trains are coming from all over Poland bringing Jews from dozens of cities,\" he continues. \"In no time, we'll be more than a million Jews in the ghetto. We need more Jewish policemen.\" I look at the ceiling with a sarcastic smile in my face. \"Ah, I see,\" I say, my voice dripping with sarcasm. \"You want me to beat up Jews and catch the Gestapo spirit.\" \"Someone has to do it,\" Heller replies, shrugging. \"But why me?\" I ask. \"I thought you only recruited boys from rich families. I mean, look at me, look at us...\" \"Yes, I've thought of you, that's why I came,\" Itzak Heller replies, his brow now furrowed. \"Your family could have a better life. Do you want to keep living from the books you sell in the streets?\" I take a long sip from my glass water and give Heller another long, sarcastic smile. \"Yes, please,\" I ask, sarcasm filling my vocal chords once more. Heller scoffs, \"I'm trying to do you a favor.\" As he sees I'm a lost cause, he turns over to Wladek with a persuading smile. \"What about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. In the police we have a jazz band, and I'm sure they'd love you to join them. Come on, sign up. You don't have a job.\" \"Thanks,\" my brother answers, always so polite. \"But I do have a job.\" Itzak Heller looks at us with exasperation written in his face. He just shakes his head and gets his cap, and storms out of our house. I sit in the sofa, taking long sips from my glass of water, while Wladek stands in the doorway. Papa turns at me and furrows his brow angrily. \"Why have you done that, Henryk?\" he asks. \"You shouldn't have been so rude to Itzak. He's offered you a job! Weren't you looking for one?\" \"Not that type of job, Papa,\" I say. \"Not that type of job.\" Papa sighs and just walks into the kitchen, exasperated.

His chest burnt. And yet, he wrote. He was relentless at it; little could anyone do to stop him. He was the scriptor of the ghetto's cruelty; the painter of its solitude and darkness in spite of its growth in population with every day that went by. He shuddered at the thought of how children inside the ghetto wouldn't even flinch at the sight of a dead person on the pavement. If it had been him, aged ten and carrying an innocent soul upon his chest, he reckoned the least he would have done would have been letting out a loud gasp, a choked sob even. So would have done his brother, Wladek, or his sisters. And yet children those days didn't really seem to be children anymore — striped from their youth, their innocence and the naivety that is usually brought by a young age, their souls were little more than wayfaring flickers of life that were constantly threatened with being blown away by the SS officials that haunted the ghetto like wolves. That was, in a way, why he started writing about the ghetto. He had always had a thing for literature, really — he had been condemned by the necessity of writing all that sped through his mind since an early age. Of course, little had the short stories he wrote inside the ghetto to do with the childish things he had written in the past. He had always praised Dostoievsky, Tolstoy, Goethe and Joyce — now he would constantly mock them and think that little did those nineteenth-century bourgeois-y authors know about the hardships of life. He had attentively read and celebrated Kafka's writings, along with a number of Jewish authors he hadn't been taught about in university. He despised positive, simple literature, written in what he believed a gaiety that could only be found in authors that determinedly had endured little hardships throughout their lives. He was glad to see that the ghetto, if not in its entirety, was somehow depicted in other authors' struggles — this, somehow, made him feel safer and somewhat at ease. And so he wrote. He would write everything that occurred to him while sitting on his old, ragged mattress next to Wladek's — he didn't have much spare time, having to feed his family and take care of his aging parents, but he usually wrote when everyone else slept and he could steal a flicker of light pouring from the little window in the small living room he slept in. He would reminisce what he had seen throughout the day and simply write it down. His style was sober yet intricate; unbiased yet passionate. He poured his feelings and thoughts into every single word. And, though he usually disliked most of what he wrote, he always felt better after dropping his aged pen. Because writing was what helped him get by, and because those hours sitting by the gloom of the night were perhaps one of the few reasons that kept him sane inside the colossal warehouse of madmen and hunger that was the Warsaw ghetto. One day, however, he was unable to keep on writing. He and his family were moved out of their temporary home in the ghetto, and were sent to work somewhere else. Little did Henryk know that was the beginning of what would be the Szpilman family's end — for five of the six of them, at least. He became quieter, angrier, moodier. He knew it wasn't his brother's fault, but there were days when he wouldn't even bother talking to him. Wladek knew that Henryk's sole ambitions were to write and to fight the nazis — and yet they were all trapped in some factory that was to be closed soon anyway. He tried to write, but he hardly could — his pen was running dry, and so was his seared soul. One could think that a man on his twenties, with most of his life ahead of him, should not feel so rotten and cold; but the truth was that Henryk Szpilman could feel Death's cold breath on the nape of his neck at all times. He, after all, couldn't help but feel like he had been defeated by the nazis. He, the young, sarcastic man who had once snickered at the thought of subordinating himself to the nazis' power. He, the wild poet who had once claimed that he would be both Rimbaud and Lord Byron — what he hadn't imagined was that, in fact, he would die around the same age as they did. In the Umschlagplatz, he wrote a few last words before they were called to board the train that would take them to what the nazis and the Judenrat would call the East . He wrote it on the front page of his sample of The Merchant of Venice — he had hated writing on his books in the past, but the war had made him change his mind about quite a number of things — and, though simple and short, he couldn't help but smile sadly as he imagined those words would be the last he wrote. \"Yes, Shylock. They've prickled us, they've tickled us, they've poisoned us. Revenge will be an option. But not today. I am too tired, too little resilient. I feel like an old soul trapped inside a young man's chest. I've known little in my life — I haven't read all the books I intended to read, I haven't visited all the places I had dreamt about as a young man . . . I never fell in love, either. But it is I, Shylock, the young yet old Henryk Szpilman, who is now parting on a quest that has been the center of discussion for all religions throughout history. Do I deserve to die? Does my father? Does my old, lovely mother? Do my sisters, or my brother? Does anyone in this Umschlagplatz deserve the fate the Nazis have condemned us to? They've wronged us, Shylock. And as for me, I am still expecting revenge. Not for me, but for my people and the struggle they have been put through.\" Upon finding an old sample of The Merchant of Venice in an old, crippled bag while cleaning up Gas Chamber 1's entrance in Treblinka, it was said that a young Polish soldier fell to his knees, weeping quietly upon the fate of a wild poet that had been tamed by hunger and despair.

The last we see of him is when Brody leaves the ghetto permanently to be hidden by his friends outside. This is what could have happened to Majorek after Brody escapes. As usual this is a non-profit piece so please don't sue me. #1 I remember the day Wladyslaw left, it was snowing but the man looked so different. The rest of us were tired, as usual from the brickworks. Building houses and re-building the shattered old ones was exhausting. Wladyslaw by this time had got himself a job in the supply shed, handing out screws and nails and tools to the workers that needed them. It was dangerous work as he often had to quickly sort through new deliveries to find any contraband the Polish resistance had sent us and hide it, but most of the time he was left alone. Plus he was indoors next to a stove, not twenty feet in the air on rickety wooden scaffolding building walls with insufficient mortar. 'G-d, how I hate the Nazis. I think the worst thing about them is their arrogance. They are so opinionated, so mean, so holier-than-thou. The way they strut about in their leather sickens me. They really believe the garbage about being superior to our subhuman; Unter-mushen they call us and they think it gives them the right to do anything. It's strange but I sometimes can't believe there used to be half a million Jews in this place. And now? After the deaths, shootings, suicides and deportations something like thirty thousand remain. I'm tired of taking orders, tired of the labour, humiliations, the lies and most of all the fear. The fear that they will kill us all someday. Someday? In the future? I thought people looked towards the future with hope; what do we hope for? A bullet, typhus or a train-ride to Treblinka. No. if my future must end it will end when I decide, not some green uniformed devil with hate behind his frosted eyes. I'm going-…' \"Majorek?\" I stopped writing, unsure as to who was calling me. If the 'wrong people' discovered I was writing in the ghetto they'd turn me in and I'd find myself dead sooner than I wished. Unconsciously I collected the papers and slid them back into their hiding place between the steel bed frame and my thin mattress. They were hidden as the voice came again. \"Majorek?\" This time I recognised the voice, Yakob. A friend. Not that I needed to fear the Nazis now, they wouldn't have used my name. We only feared collaborators here, people who'd turn members of the underground over to the Gestapo for an extra loaf of bread and a smile full of empty promises. I finally found my voice in a reply. \"I'm here\". Yakob crept over, it was a round midnight and most workers in our section were asleep, lost in their own personal nightmares. \"Yakob, what is it? What do you want?\" Yakob put his face to mine so to not wake the others. He was clean shaven, one of the few personal traits he refused to let the Nazis beat out of him, he was never scruffy. Very dapper. \"Januk wants to see you\". \"Now?\" \"Yes\". \"Why now?\" \"I don't know why, he just told me to get you\". \"Does he think something's on the rise?\" Yakob shrugged, he didn't know. I'm going to have to go and see Januk then. \"Ok, I'm coming\" I said. Just hoping that I'd be able to stay warm a little longer; nothing like a Polish winter to make you appreciate heat. We slept in our clothes in the barracks, the single wood stove producing pathetic amounts of heat. Good in a way as it saves us time putting our clothes on in the mornings, or of course when we want to do a moonlight flip out of the barrack and into another part of the ghetto. We're lucky too; the Nazis are currently lax in their interest. Continual haranguing of three hundred thousand people over four months onto trains means they are beginning to overlook the movements of the last few thousand. I knew where Januk was but I let Yakob lead the way as we crept down into the cellar of the building they used as a barracks and slipped out a window and into the ruins that surrounded the waste ground they used for the roll call. Januk's building was a good ten minutes away and that ten minutes didn't include 'hiding time' if we happened to run in the irregular Nazis patrols that occurred all over the ghetto. Sometimes I wished they were more regular, and then we could work our plans around them. But like I said the Germans were beginning to get sloppy and although this was a problem it's certainly the least of many. Finally after scurrying through two bombed-out apartment blocks and across the first floor of what used to be a textile factory I saw our objective. Januk was holed up in the basement of a warehouse; the only way in was through a sewer conduit accessible from the main part of the street. In order to see him we were going to have to pry open the man-hole cover in front of the warehouse. I'd done this twice before, but never with Yakob and not with a German patrol encamped less than two hundred yards away. This is going to be a problem.

A young boy was being hauled to death in front of me, and I couldn't do anything. Another woman was being badly hit as well - I could see she was pregnant. Her father, an old man, tried to protect her, but the Jew police would not listen. When he got fed up of the old man's pleas, he gave him a painful hit with the back of his shotgun and the man fell down to the ground, bleeding severely. There they all lay, dead corpses advising us about what the Germans would do to us once we hopped onto that deathly train. And still I jumped on. What else could I do? Run away and try to die like a hero? That wouldn't do me any good. My family needed me, and I had nothing left. They had burnt my poems, ripped out all of the pages in my books. The only thing left inside my numb and swollen body was a small hope that everything my work mate Janusz had told me about Treblinka wasn't true. If you tickle us, do we not laugh? Over the train journey to Treblinka, my brain went numb. For the first time in all those years, I felt something unknown to me: fear . Not the fear a child feels when he believes a ghost is hiding under his bed. This was something a lot more deeper. Something inside me told me I didn't have much time left. I was standing next to Papa, who was mourning silently for a piece of bread. It broke my heart to see him like that, but I couldn't do anything about it. I searched in my bag and found nothing but a couple of books. Those damn books had been my life, and now they were all gone. All but the two I had brought with me, The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare and The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. My mind went back to the time when I first read The Merchant of Venice . I was a skinny, rather cocky fourteen-year-old with revolutionary ideas about fascism and communism. Of course, I had no idea that barely ten years later I would find myself trapped in a train, being sent to my most certain death. I would always throw puns and sarcasms at my older siblings, and pick on a twelve-year-old and rather weak Halina. I chuckled softly, remembering that one time I had pulled her braids' hair ties off and she had started crying loudly when I hung them out from the living room's window, laughing as I never had. But then, a feeling I had never felt before washed over me. I couldn't recognize it at first, but after a while I assumed what I felt was nothing less than guilt. I felt guilty for not being nice enough to my little sister, for laughing at Regina's job as a lawyer, for not telling Papa and Mama how much I loved them, not once. But most of all, I felt guilty for having despised Wladek's attempts to be a nice brother. In that very moment, it struck me how many times had he offered himself to help me, how much he had done for me without me asking him. I felt such a lump in my throat, such a guilt inside my chest... \"Papa, where's Wladek?\" I asked. Dad did something like a smile before wrenching once again, clutching his belly in a heartbreaking pain. \"He escaped,\" Papa whispered. He escaped. Wladek escaped. I would never get to say I was sorry, nor would I ever be able to see my only brother again. Now, all I could do for him was wish him the long, calm life I would never have. If you poison us, do we not die? As we mounted off the train in Treblinka, I looked up at the sky. I didn't know how many days had gone by ever since we had left Warsaw, but the sun shone brightly over us, tempting everyone in the surrounding area to go outside and have a nice bath in the lake. But of course, none of us would enjoy such a pleasure - we were just lambs being sent to slaughter. I never saw Papa, Mama, Regina or Halina again. Perhaps they were killed right after our arrival, or perhaps they were just sent to another bunkhouse. That, I cannot tell. The only thing I can remember from those days I spent in Treblinka was the thought that every day that I was kept alive was the worst torture they could put me into. I worked until my hands went numb and my knees pleaded my brain to stop. I knew I wouldn't be able to take it much longer. One day, a German officer said they were going to move us to another bunkhouse, and before that we had to get a medical check and a small shower. I knew what was coming, but I did not protest. It would not do me any good to be killed by a German's bullets. A few of us entered the small chamber where they said they would give us a small shower and then take us to our new, special bunkerhouse, which I suspected as one of the ovens in the camp. We would die in the worst conditions - hungry, thirsty, naked. Away from everyone I loved and knowing I would soon find out the reason of being of every religion. By the time being, I doubted there was anyone up there, but as always, hope was the only thing stronger than fear. I felt how my body went numb as the taps were turned on, but I was not afraid. And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? After all, I had been dead for a long time before I breathed in the painful gas that burnt my lungs violently. When you burn a poet's lyrics, you're burning his soul too. ","Summary":" If you prick us, do we not bleed?

Summary: Hosenfeld waits, and hopes beyond hope, that someone will come save him. SLASH! Hosenfeld/Szpilman. Dedicated to Jem Griffith . I hope this story finds you well and that you enjoy it. The Music's Still Playing His throat was dry. Hosenfeld tried to swallow, but his mouth was just as dry as his throat and it did nothing but make his throat raw. His lips were cracked and his hands were bruised and bleeding. The sun beat down, mercilessly, on him and his fellow captives as they all sat huddled together in a small fenced in area. He didn't know where he was, what day it was, or even what was happening to the the world around him. But what was bothering him the most was not knowing what had happened to his family. Hosenfeld wanted to cry, but he was so dehydrated and had already cried so much in the past few... Days? Weeks? Months? He didn't know. All he knew was that soon he'd be carted out of the containment area in a little wooden wheel-barrel and dumped into some pit with the rest of the dead prisoners. At least then I will stop hurting, Hosenfeld thought to himself, dully. Currently, Hosenfeld was sitting in the middle of the containment area with his back pressed against the backs of two other men, his knees drawn up to his chest, his face looking skyward. Clouds rolled by overhead, and he prayed they'd stay for a moment, just to give them a reprieve for the scorching heat. They didn't though. One of the men who's back was pressed against his moved and slightly elbowed Hosenfeld's back before he completely fell over and landed face first into the hard, unforgiving earth. Hosenfeld sighed as he turned around, looking down at the dead soldier before him. He had known that this was coming for a few days. The man was old and already sick when they brought him here, and with these living conditions, he never stood a chance. After another moment, Hosenfeld turned back around and turned his face back up to the blue and white sky above him. He watched as a bird- he couldn't discern what kind -glided across the sky. It was so elegant, so smooth, and so confident in its movements, daring to take leaps and bounds that even men had to think twice about. It was so beautiful, so... Free. Hosenfeld closed his eyes and tried to imagine himself gliding up there in the clouds, far away from the troubles and strife of the world far below. He tried to imagine what it would feel like to feel the air slipping through his fingers; his body light as air as he rose higher and higher into the sky. Totally free. Soon, he saw nothing but blue sky around him and blue ocean below him. He could even smell the salt and feel the spray of the ocean on his face as he imagined himself swooping down low and letting the wind carry him where it would. And then... There, carried on the breeze, came the beautiful melody of a piano being played. A tune he thought he'd never hear again. And soon he was drifting back to that house. To that room. To that piano. To Szpilman. The scruffy looking Jew sat at the Piano, his long, pale fingers dancing over ivory and black keys. The music flowing from the instrument sounding almost ethereal. And there he, himself, stood, old gray uniform and neatly cut hair. He watched the young man's face as he became so engrossed in the music that he had closed his eyes and knitted his brows in such a way you'd think he was in pain. His lips parted, showing how full and pink they really were under the man's beard. Finally, the music stopped and the man looked up, wide, brown eyes seeming to stare straight into Hosenfeld's very soul. \"Captain?\" He questioned and without realizing it, Hosenfeld had moved to stand a mere two feet from where the younger man sat. \"Yes?\" Hosenfeld answered, his voice much softer and smoother than he last remembered. \"Where are you?\" Hosenfeld blinked. What did he mean? He was right in front of him. How could Szpilman miss him? Hosenfeld reached out, his hand resting on Szpilman's shoulder. He gave it a light squeeze, feeling warm muscle and solid bone under his palm. Szpilman only blinked up at the captain and repeated his question. Hosenfeld cocked his head slightly. He didn't understand what the other man was asking. What was he talking about? He was here with Szpilman! Couldn't Szpilman see that!? Why couldn't he...? Suddenly, Hosenfeld's world shook. Shouts, cries, and pain flooded his senses. His eyes opened with a sharp intake of breath as he was shoved to the ground. His hands braced him against the ground, keeping him from doing a face plant into a rock, but also causing his already torn up hands to split open in new cuts and start bleeding anew. Getting his senses about him, Hosenfeld quickly looked about. It was dark out, the sun having gone down a long time ago. It was just a dream, Hosenfeld thought to himself, feeling more sad than he thought he should have. Why would he dream of being back in that house with Szpilman and not with his family? Why would that dream make him happy? Hosenfeld didn't know and didn't have time to dwell on such things as the guards were ordering the prisoners to rise to their feet and move. They were loading everyone up into trucks and moving them to a better holding facility- jail -to await a proper trail. At least, that is what they had told the prisoners. Hosenfeld figured it would be more like the Nazi concentration camps; only this time they were the Jews. And somehow, even after all the pain he had suffered through already, he could not blame them. They were angry, and rightfully so. Their kin and loved ones had been, mercilessly, killed right before them. Their rights and freedoms stripped from them. They had been forced to flee their homes and leave behind everything they knew and loved, just to stay alive. They were angry, and now had the power to exact a little revenge of their own. So, Hosenfeld could understand why they were doing this. He was dying. He wasn't going to try and lie to himself. He sat with his back pressed up against the cold stone of the prison walls. His four other cellmates paid him no mind. Rather, they kept to themselves, forming their own little group that excluded him. Like animals, they could smell death all over him. Who wanted to befriend a dying man in this place? There were no windows in this place. Just three stone walls and one wall of pure iron bars. Hosenfeld ached to see the sky again. To feel the sunlight kiss his skin. It was getting harder for him each day to remember what shade of blue the sky really was. It was such an awful thing to forget, he knew. When he was a free man, he guessed he must have taken being able to look up at the sky for granted. A mistake, if given the chance, he wouldn't make again. But then... There was no hope in this place. Hosenfeld closed his eyes, likely for the last time, he knew. But he didn't want to die looking at those walls. He wanted to see the sky one more time. To fly through the sky with the grace and the ease of someone without chains that bound and pains that crippled. Just... One more time. He would fly. And the music would play. The music played on, long after the sky had turned black and his body had fallen back to earth. The music played through the darkness and through the pain. It kept him warm. It kept him grounded. It kept him safe. He moved towards the beautiful sounds of someone playing a piano, even though his body screamed in agony at every step and the all consuming darkness covered him like a thick, wet blanket. He was in a thick haze. His body felt sluggish and he still couldn't get out of the darkness, but the music had become louder. Clearer. Sharper. He just had to keep moving! He knew he could reach that sweet sound if he could just keep moving, even if his body was threatening to fall apart on him. ...just keep moving... A bright light pierced through the darkness, bring its own kind of pain with it as Hosenfeld recoiled from the light, at first. The music stopped, and Hosenfeld felt a moment of panic. So he raced toward the light, embracing the pain as it flooded his senses completely. Hosenfeld opened his eyes slowly, cringing at the brightness of the room. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust, but after that he realized he wasn't in his cell anymore. The bed he was on was soft and warm and not made of stone. There was a window next to him and the whole place smelled clean and fresh. Where was he? And how had he gotten there? The music started again. It was so beautiful. So calming. So relaxing. Hosenfeld could lay there and listen to it forever if he were allotted. Wouldn't be a bad way to die, in his opinion. All too soon, in Hosenfeld's opinion, the music stopped. There was some slight creaking as someone moved about in the rooms outside of Hosenfeld's own. The captain didn't dare make a sound. But he watched as the door to his room slowly swung open, revealing a tall, well dressed man with neatly cut and combed hair. Their eyes met and Hosenfeld saw surprise flash across the stranger's face. \"You're awake!\" The man announced. \"How long have you been awake?\" Something about the man was familiar. It nagged at the back of Hosenfeld's brain, but he couldn't place it. \"Not long,\" Hosenfeld replied, voice hoarse and rough from under-use and being severely dry. The young man noticed and quickly moved to hold a glass of water to Hosenfeld's lips, who drank, greedily, thanking his caretaker after he had finished the glass. \"How do you feel today?\" Hosenfeld stared up at the younger man before him. At this close he could get a better look at him. He was Jewish, there was no mistaking that fact. \"Could be worse,\" he finally answered. \"Oh,\" the man said, unsure as he fidgeted where he stood. \"I have medicine for the pain. But first you must eat something.\" Hosenfeld stared intently at the young man's face. Who was he? And just as he was about to open his mouth to voice his question, he glanced down at the pale hands that were nervously wrapping and unwrapping themselves from around each other. He had seen those hands many times, hand even dreamed about them. \"Jew!\" Hosenfeld exclaimed as he struggled to sit up in his bed, in an attempt to get closer to the other man. \"Captain!\" Szpilman moved quickly to wrap his arms around the soldier and helped him into a sitting position. \"You shouldn't exert yourself.\" Szpilman fluffed Hosenfeld's pillow before completely moving away from the other man. \"You gave me quite the scare. When I first brought you here the doctor warned me that you might not wake up at all.\" \"You found me.\" \"Of course,\" replied Szpilman, giving the other man a small, sad smile. \"How?\" \"Does it really matter?\" Hosenfeld was at a loss. He felt like he was drifting off into a dark and unknown sea. But that was okay. He had found his guiding star. So long as he could keep his eyes on Szpilman, he would never be lost again. \"You need to rest,\" whispered Szpilman, gently, as he moved back over to the door. \"And to eat. I'll make some soup and bring it to you in about an hour. How does that sound?\" \"Good. Thank you,\" replied Hosenfeld, finding that he still couldn't take his eyes off the other man's neatly shaven face. Who knew there was a rather handsome looking man under all that scruff? Not to mention, how much younger the pianist looked this way. Before Szpilman turned to leave the room completely, he turned back to look at Hosenfeld, casting the young soldier a small smile back at him, something close to guilt and sorrow in his eyes, which Hosenfeld thought was odd. There was nothing Szpilman had to feel sorry for. He never did anything to hurt the young captain. And yet... He still looked at Hosenfeld as if he were the cause of all the young captain's pain and afflictions. After dinner, which Szpilman and Hosenfeld shared in Hosnefeld's room with Szpilman sitting in a chair next to Hosenfeld's bed, Hosenfeld had almost instantly fallen asleep again. That left Szpilman to clean up their dinner and get himself prepared for bed. Szpilman had been in the middle of washing the dishes when he heard screams coming from Hosenfeld's room, his hands wrist deep in soapy, cool water. At first, Szpilman had been terrified and ready to flee, all those years on the run telling him to run and hide. But then he remembered where he was and who's room the screaming was coming from. Dropping the bowl he was washing back into the sink of water and dashing down the hall, his hands dripping soapy globs all along the floor as he went. He opened Hosenfeld's door without so much of a warning, and charged inside the room, eyes scanning for any danger. No one else was in the room, which Szpilman gave a quick sigh of gratefulness about. If someone had been in the room and hurting Hosenfeld, Szpliman wasn't sure he could fight them; he would try, of course, but he had never been much of a fighter. Next he turned his gaze toward Hosenfeld, who now had stopped screaming and was sitting up in bed, brow glistening with sweat and eyes wide as he frantically searched for some unseen terror. \"Hosenfeld?\" Szpilman ventured once Hosnefeld's gaze scanned over him, taking a very small, slow step toward the other man on the bed. \"Szpilman,\" gasped Hosenfeld, releasing a breath he had been holding in before panting heavily. \"I- I...\" The young captain's mouth opened and closed as he tried to voice his thoughts but it was so hard- so very hard. And without realizing it, Hosenfeld's hand had reached out toward Szpilman, almost of its own accord, beckoning the other man to him. Szpilman quickly slid over to Hosenfeld's side of the bed, kneeling as he took Hosenfeld's slightly shaking hand in his own, his still damp hand causing the bandages on Hosenfeld's own to soak up some of the water and become damp themselves. \"You are okay, Wilm,\" whispered Szpilman, rubbing Hosenfeld's one hand in both of his own. \"You are safe now. I promise.\" Hosenfeld took comfort in the small gesture and the soft look in Szpilman's eyes, and soon he found the tension leaving his shoulders and his breathing even out. \"Thank you, Szpilman,\" said Hosenfeld, giving the other man's hand a soft squeeze. \"Wladek,\" replied Szpilman. \"What?\" Asked Hosenfeld, his face scrunching up in confusion. \"You can call me Wladek,\" explained Szpilman. \"I think we are friends now, Yeah? We can call each other by our Christian names.\" Hosenfeld smiled. He was happy and content, something he hadn't been in a long time. It was a nice, warm feeling. Hosenfeld nodded his head at Szpilman, looking down at their joined hands on the bed, noticing how Szpilman was still kneeling down on the hard wooden floor. \"That must hurt you,\" Hosenfeld nodded toward Szpilman's knees. \"Here.\" The German tugged at Szpilman's hands, moving slightly over so that the Jew could sit on the bed with him. \"Sit down.\" \"I-. W-wouldn't,\" began Szpilman, stuttering nervously, but rising to his feet all the same and sitting carefully on the edge of the bed, \"you be more comfortable if I moved to sit in the chair over there?\" Szpliman looked over his shoulder to the chair he had been sitting in for dinner. \"Here is fine,\" continued Hosenfeld, rubbing Szpilman's knuckles with his thumb. \"Unless you don't want to sit here.\" Szpilman quickly shook his head, even as he felt his ears and face heat up. He understood how Hosenfeld was feeling right now. After so much isolation and fear, a little human contact and a kind touch can go a long way. \"This is fine. But are you sure I am the one you want to be close to?\" Hosenfeld had to stop and question himself. How did he feel about Szpilman? He realized long ago that he cared about Szpilman. He cared about lots of people, that was no strange thing for him, even if some people said differently. He saw no restrictions to love. No price tags. No obligations. No requirements that needed reaching. Just a gift freely given. \"I want you here with me. I understand if you feel uncomfortable with that,\" began Hosenfeld, squeezing Szpilman's hand one last time before completely releasing it. \"But you are a dear friend to me, and your presence brings me comfort. I just want you close.\" Szpilman blinked. He hadn't realized Hosendfeld had felt that way. He thought he was the only one who felt like that. Szpilman reached out to take Hosenfeld's hand once more as he slid up onto the bed more. \"You are a dear friend to me too, and I care about you deeply. Whatever comfort I can give you, you can freely take.\" The two men smiled at each other, soft and sweet as they sat next to one another on the small bed, talking about things of their pasts. Lives before the war. Loves of their lives. Family. And their futures. Without them realizing it, the sun had set outside and the room around them had grown dark. They both were now laying side by side, their shoulders and arms warm where they connected between them, neither minding the contact, enjoying it actually. They each stared up at the cracking ceiling as they spoke of their hopes and dreams, and fears. \"I fear...\" began Szpilman. \"I fear, being alone again. I fear the absolute darkness that comes with knowing that even in a crowded room you are completely alone.\" He felt Hosenfeld's head nod next to his, knowing that the other man understood how he felt. \"I fear,\" Hosenfeld whispered. \"I fear...\" There was a sharp intake of breath before a slow release. \"That... the music will stop.\" In the dark, Szpilman turned his head to look at the side of Hosenfeld's face. He didn't understand what the other man meant. \"When I was in that camp. I dreamed of you.\" \"You... did?\" Szpilman didn't sound disgusted or worried, just curious. \"Yes. You were playing for me. Your music guided me through the dark. You saved me, even in my dreams,\" Hosenfeld explained with a small, amused laugh, turning his head to be face to face with Szpilman. \"Thank you again for finding me.\" Szpilman could only smile at his friend. Something he learned in a lifetime of playing the piano, was that you didn't always need words to communicate feelings or thoughts. Hosenfeld turned back to look at the dark ceiling again, his hand between them reaching out and grasping Szpilman's own hand. Szpilman heard Hosenfeld yawn and went to move from the bed, but Hosenfeld wouldn't release his hand. \"Stay. Please,\" said Hosenfeld. \"We don't have to be alone when we have each other.\" Szpilman felt something strange stir in the pit of his stomach. It wasn't all that unpleasant, just... Different. Szpilman, after a moment of trying to sort through his feelings, slid back next to Hosenfeld, who released Szpilman's hand to roll over on his side so that Szpilman would have more room. As Szpilman got comfortable in the bed, he carefully pulled the blankets over himself and Hosenfeld. Both men turned away from each other, keeping their backs to each other, both laying on their sides, their eyes wide open. And Szpilman knew that sleep wouldn't come easy for him tonight. Then he felt the bed shift and bounce softly as Hosenfeld rolled over, now facing Szpilman's back. \"Wladek?\" He questioned softly. \"Yes?\" Whispered back Szpilman, not moving. \"May I- Could I, I mean to say...\" Hosenfeld groaned softly before digging himself deeper into his pillow and blanket. \"Nevermind. Good night Wladek.\" \"Okay, good night Wilm.\" It wasn't long after that that Szpilman heard Hosenfeld's breathing even out and deepen, signaling that the other man was asleep. Too bad for Szpilman that he, himself, couldn't get to sleep as well. He laid there for a few minutes longer, sleep evading him quite tactfully, he thought, before he decided to roll over, bringing him face to face with a sleeping Hosenfeld. In the darkness, Szpilman couldn't see the other man's face, but he could feel the warmth from his body, his soft breathing, and the light tickle of his hair across his nose. And then, in a movement so quick that Szpilman barely knew what was happening, Hosenfeld's eyes snapped open and he was lunging forward and straight into Szpilman. Szpilman let out a small 'oomph' sound as the air was suddenly knocked out of him, and out of instinct he quickly wrapped his arms around Hosenfeld's shoulders. \"Wilm,\" stated Szpilman as he held the other man close. \"Wilm! You are okay. You are just dreaming.\" Hosenfeld gasped for air, finally waking up enough to realize that his face was pressed, flush, up against Szpilman's chest, his arms trapped between his and Szpilman's stomachs, Szpilman's own hands wrapped tightly around his shivering form. \"Wladek?\" The arms around him loosened enough for Hosenfeld to pull away and look up into the dark face of his companion. \"I'm sorry.\" \"It's okay. We all get nightmares,\" confirmed Szpilman with a smiled, even though he didn't think Hosenfeld could see it. \"Did I hurt you?\" \"No! Of course not.\" \"I'm sorry. This must be awkward for you.\" \"No. Not really.\" Szpilman pulled Hosenfeld closer, knowing the other man needed closeness and comfort right now. And Hosenfeld could do nothing as his breath caught in his throat and he was suddenly resting his head on Szpilman's shoulder, the Jewish man's hands running through his hair, gently coaxing his minuscule tremors away. He slept all through the rest of the night without ever having one nightmare, with one of Szpilman's arms wrapped around his waist and the other tangled with his own between them. In the morning, Hosenfeld had awoken to Szpilman humming a soft and comforting tune, his hand running slow and soothing stroke's up and down his back. And that's when Hosenfeld realized that the music was still playing. The End Das Ende Owari Fin A/N: They needed fluff, plain and simple. Thank you so much for reading.

After long days on the front lines in Germany, he found serenity in the music. Jacks Captain was among the men who would sit and listen to Jack play at night while they sipped on a forgotten bottle of scotch. Other men would sit around and wonder what tomorrow would bring, and if they would be alive. Jacks cousin was in the piano parlor, when all of a sudden a German Tiger tank echoed in the distance. The men gathered their gear and headed for the roof of the house, but Jack kept playing. As he sat in the dark playing those eighty-eight keys the rest of the company was yelling at him. \"Jack! Stop playing now, they are going to hear you!\" a man yelled. \"Jack! Stop this instant, and that's an order!\" his Captain yelled. But Jack did not stop. Once the Tiger tank made it to the house where they Army unit was. All of the men were hiding on the roof, praying that no one would see them. Jack was playing along to Pachelbel's Cannon in D when he noticed black boots standing in the doorway. \"Up!\" The man shouted at Jack. Jack stopped, looked up at the man, and placed his hands in the air. The German officer looked at Jack, and asked, \"You play?\" Jack replied with a shivering \"Yes\". The German officer replied, \"Play something for me\". Jack sat down at the piano and began to play a Beethoven's Sonanta Quasi Una Fantasia. The German officer sat down, poured himself a class of the scotch, and listened to Jack play the piano. Once the song had ended Jack looked at the German officer. The officer stood up and told Jack that the war would be over soon, and that he would like to hear him play on German radio one day. Jacked gave a scared smile and said, \"Yes, that is my goal. I would like to play on the radio.\" The German officer set down his scotch and walked out the door. He told his crew on the Tiger tank to continue on. Jack started to cry as the rest of the company started down from the roof. Jack's Captain said, \"Boy you and that piano might have saved us all!\" Jack stated, \"Yes, but I cannot believe that he enjoyed my music.\" Captain replied, \"Keep playing, and never leave those keys.\" ","Summary":" Eighty-eight keys A young man by the name of Jack sat every evening and played the piano.

Semakin jelas saat pintu utama dibuka. Seorang anak laki-laki dengan fokus memainkan piano, disamping nya berdiri seseorang yang lebih tua beberapa tahun memegang tongkat pendek seperti mastreo handal. \"Nona duduk lah dulu, sebentar lagi giliran anda.\" ujar sang pelayan menyuruh anak majikan nya duduk di kursi tunggu salah satu tempat les piano ternama di kota mereka. Gadis itu dengan patuh duduk menghadap jendela masih mendengarkan Lantunan piano dari anak laki-laki didalam sana. Beberapa menit kemudian suara itu berhenti di tutup dengan suara tepuk tangan. \"Bagus-bagus. Permainan mu semakin handal, tuan. Aku yakin kau akan menjadi pianist handal.\" Lelaki itu terkekeh pelan, menggeleng. \"Kau berlebihan.\" ia membereskan peralatan nya sebelum beranjak pergi. \"Ah, siapa dia ?\" Lelaki yang lebih tua berkacamata tadi mengikuti arah telunjuk sang tuan muda. Salah satu murid emas nya. \"Oh, dia baru masuk hari ini. Anak dari keluarga besar Kim itu.\" \"Kim ? Kim entertainment ?\" Pelatih hanya mengangguk. Anak lelaki pemain piano tadi hendak bertanya lebih lanjut sebelum kepala pelayan nya memanggil. \"Tuan, kita harus bergegas. Ayah dan ibunda tuan sudah menunggu sekarang.\" ketua pelayan mengatakan nya dengan santun dan penuh hormat. \"Baiklah.\" ia berpamitan dengan pelatih nya menunduk sebagai tanda hormat sebelum mengikuti langkah ketua pelayan rumah mereka sambil menelan pil, melewati gadis yang masih fokus berjalan kedepan tanpa menoleh sedikit pun. OoO Xiumin duduk disofa sembari menunggu giliran nya bermain piano. Ia memandang sekitar, memperhatikan seisi rumah dengan seksama sampai mata nya beralih ke dalam ruangan berlapis kaca. Seorang gadis dengan wajah menunduk, disamping nya pelatih Han sedang berbicara yang tak bisa Xiumin dengar. Lelaki tua berkacamata itu terlihat membentak lalu berlalu pergi setelah memukul piano dengan keras membuat suara cukup bising. Pelatih Han memang terkenal tegas dan ketat dalam melatih seseorang. Belum lagi murid yang ia didik memiliki bakat seperti diri nya. Han tidak akan segan-segan melatih anak itu hingga melebihi batas kemampuan sang anak. Xiumin baru pertama kali melihat pelatih Han semarah tadi. Lelaki itu masih terdiam ditempat memperhatikan gerak-gerik sang gadis yang tampak mencari sesuatu hingga ia tak sengaja menyentuh toples kaca berisi permen warna-warni dan membuat nya jatuh kelantai. Xiumin berdiri, berniat membantu hingga ia diam membeku ditempat. Memandang heran kearah gadis itu sebelum menoleh kearah kepala pelayan yang sering menemani nya sejak kecil. \"Dia...\" Xiumin tak berniat melanjutkan ucapannya melihat kepala pelayan menaruh jari telunjuk di bibir. Menyuruh lelaki itu tak berkomentar lebih lanjut. Kepala pelayan keluarga Xiumin beranjak pergi menemui pelatih Han untuk membicarakan jadwal latihan tuan muda nya. Karena ada keperluan keluarga jadwal latihan tuan muda harus di ubah. Xiumin memandang sejenak kearah pintu yang sudah tertutup rapat. Ia bergegas memasuki ruangan kaca tadi, tak berniat mengeluarkan suara Xiumin hanya memandang gadis yang sudah kembali duduk di kursi piano. Ia hanya diam tanpa menyentuh tuts piano. Xiumin berjalan pelan kearah gadis tadi. Melambai-lambaikan tangan tepat ke wajah gadis itu. Menunggu reaksi. Nihil. Gadis itu sama sekali tak terganggu. Mata nya fokus menghadap ke depan tepat ke wajah Xiumin. Lelaki tadi tak kehabisan akal. Memasang wajah terjelek yang ia punya untuk membuat gadis tadi ketawa. Masih sama, gadis itu sama sekali tak bereaksi. Setelah semua yang ia lakukan Xiumin duduk disamping gadis yang akhirnya menoleh. \"Pelatih Han ?\" Xiumin menggeleng. \"Bukan.\" ia menggeser tubuhnya mendekat. Menatap ke manik mata coklat didepan sana. Terdiam cukup lama. \"Siapa kamu ?\" suara lembut namun sarat akan makna membuat Xiumin menghentikan kegiatan nya. Ia gelabakan sendiri sebelum cengengesan tak jelas. \"Kau bisa memanggil ku, Xiumin.\" lelaki itu menjulurkan tangan. Beberapa detik kemudian lelaki itu sadar, ia harus melakukan sesuatu. Jadi Xiumin menarik tangan gadis itu untuk menjabat tangan nya. \"Xiumin.\" \"Nama yang bagus.\" puji nya tulus membuat rona merah hadir tanpa gadis itu sadari. \"Ka-Ka-Kau sendiri ?\" \"You jung. Kim You Jung.\" Xiumin mangut-mangut lantas meletakkan tangan nya keatas tuts piano. \"Kau mau mendengar lagu buatan ku ?\" \"Lagu ? Buatan dirimu sendiri ? Wah! Kamu jenius sekali.\" puji You Jung polos. Xiumin terkekeh pelan menanggapi reaksi lawan bicara nya. \"Tidak. Aku tidak sejenius itu, masih ada yang lebih hebat dari ku salah satu nya pelatih Han.\" Xiumin merenggangkan otot-otot tangan sebelum memulai bait pertama dengan baik. \"Itu sangat indah.\" You Jung menutup mata nya menikmati alunan piano yang tak pernah terdengar selembut ini. Ia saja yang berlatih dari kecil tidak pernah bisa memainkan piano seindah dan sebagus itu. \"Maaf, aku baru menyelesaikan setengah nya saja. Tapi, aku berjanji akan menyelesaikan secepatnya dan menunjukkan kepada mu.\" ucap Xiumin malu mengakhiri permainan tunggal nya barusan. You Jung tersenyum tipis. Xiumin menengok kebelakang, pintu ruangan pelatih Han terbuka lebar dan ketua pelayan nya baru saja keluar membuat Xiumin bergegas sembunyi dibalik piano. \"Apa kau baru saja bermain seperti tuan Xiumin, Nona You Jung ?\" pelatih Han menghampiri You Jung yang masih tersenyum di bangku nya. Han celingak-celinguk memastikan telinganya tadi tidak salah dengar. \"Kalo kau bisa bermain sebagus itu daritadi, aku tidak akan memarahi mu.\" ucap pelatih Han dingin sebelum pergi meninggalkan ruang latihan. Xiumin mengintip memastikan pelatih Han sudah pergi. Ia menghembuskan napas lega kalo saja tadi pelatih Han tahu ia disini, bisa habis diri nya kena omel yang melebihi Ibunda nya sendiri. \"Kamu darimana saja ? Tiba-tiba hilang seperti tadi.\" komentar You Jung saat merasa kursi disamping nya kembali di duduki seseorang yang ia yakini itu Xiumin. \"Tuan Han datang. Kalo dia tahu aku yang main piano tadi bersama mu aku bisa kena amarah nya, asal kau tahu amarah tuan Han sangat mengerikan.\" sungut Xiumin memastikan pelatih Han tak kembali secara tiba-tiba. You Jung tertawa mendengar bagaimana Xiumin memanggil pelatih mereka dengan panggilan tuan. Xiumin mengambil permen yang berada didalam toples kaca di atas piano. \"Buka mulut mu.\" Walau ragu You Jung tetap membuka mulut. Perasaan manis menyeruak didalam mulut saat permen manis kesukaan nya menyentuh lidah. You Jung kembali tersenyum seraya bergumam terima kasih kepada Xiumin. Xiumin menatap jari telunjuk yang tak sengaja menyentuh permukaan bibir You Jung. Dan ia mulai gugup sekarang. \"Kau sangat menyukai permen ?\" \"Iya, mereka sudah seperti obat bagi ku.\" Xiumin ber-oh ria sebelum buru-buru mencari tempat kecil untuk menyimpan pil. Meminum dengan cepat membuat suara grasak-grusuk disekitar terdengar. \"Ada apa ?\" tanya You Jung khawatir. \"Tidak ada apa-apa.\" tangan nya kembali mengambil permen untuk gadis itu. \"Buka mulut mu. Manis ?\" You Jung mengangguk senang. Entah kenapa berada didekat Xiumin membuatnya merasa di hargai. \"Oh! Kau mau jalan-jalan ?\" tawaran mendadak dari Xiumin membuat You Jung agak kaget. \"Tapi, bagaimana dengan pelatih Han?\" Xiumin menggaruk kepala nya yang tidak gatal. Mendadak bingung sendiri. \"Sekarang memang tidak bisa. Bagaimana kalo besok ? Jadwal latihan di percepat bukan? Jadi kita bisa membolos~\" \"Membolos ?\" You Jung mengerjap heran, ia tak menyangka Xiumin bisa berkata seperti itu dengan santai. Padahal You Jung pernah mendengar pelatih Han tak akan segan-segan menghukum murid nya hanya karena mereka anak emas atau sejenisnya. Peraturan tetap peraturan. \"Bagaimana ? Kau mau kan? Daripada suntuk bermain dengan piano mulu.\" seru Xiumin semangat. You Jung tampak berpikir sejenak sebelum mengangguk pelan. Xiumin sontak memekik girang sebelum berhenti sadar itu akan mengundang perhatian. \"Baiklah! Besok kita jalan-jalan~\" Xiumin bergegas merapikan barang bawaan nya sebelum pergi ia berucap. \"Sampai jumpa besok, You Jung.\" \"Hati-hati.\" sebelum ucapan itu selesai suara kepala beradu dengan pintu terdengar nyaring memenuhi seisi ruangan. You Jung menoleh kaget. \"Xiumin ?\" \"A-Aku baik-baik saja. Tidak papa tidak papa.\" Xiumin membuka pintu dengan jidat merah. Untung saja You Jung tak melihatnya tadi, bagaimana reaksi bahagia Xiumin sampai tidak sadar pintu ada didepan wajah nya. You Jung tersenyum sebelum Xiumin benar-benar hilang di balik pintu. OoO Suara tongkat memukul piano terdengar dibarengi suara tegas disamping Xiumin membuat lelaki itu agak terpenjarat kaget. Dia kembali fokus dengan note-note didepan nya walau lirikan mata nya mengikuti langkah You Jung yang baru datang dari balik jendela yang mengarah langsung ke gerbang utama. \"Tuan Xiumin seperti nya hari ini anda tidak fokus. Ada masalah ?\" Xiumin lantas menggeleng cepat. Buru-buru membereskan barang nya sebelum menunduk memberi hormat. Latihan nya selesai lebih cepat. Pelatih Han menatap nya sebentar sebelum berbalik masuk ke ruang pribadi milik nya. Xiumin bergegas menghampiri You Jung yang tak di kawal penjaga pribadi milik nya. Mencolek pundak gadis itu. \"Kita pergi sekarang ?\" \"Xiumin ?\" You Jung agak kaget mendengar suara yang ia hapal tepat di sisi kiri nya. \"Pergi ? Kemana ?\" \"Kau lupa ? Kita jalan-jalan, ingat ?\" You Jung membentuk huruf O dengan mulutnya. Mangut-mangut saat ingat dengan janji mereka kemarin. \"Ah, tapi sebentar lagi giliran ku.\" \"Pelatih Han ada keperluan sebentar. Jadi latihan mu di undur dulu.\" \"Benarkah ? Kenapa pelatih Han tidak memberi tahu ku dulu ?\" \"Mungkin dia lupa.\" Xiumin memperhatikan sekitar nya sebelum menarik tangan You Jung membawa gadis itu pergi sebelum pelatih Han keluar dari ruangan nya. Sebenarnya Xiumin sengaja berbohong karena ia ingin mengenal You Jung lebih dalam. Kalo hanya sekedar ngobrol biasa itu akan susah mengingat jadwal mereka berdua yang saling bertabrakan belum lagi pengawal Xiumin akhir-akhir ini lebih posesif dari biasa nya berkat perintah dari sang Ibunda tercinta. \"Kita mau kemana ?\" You Jung bertanya saat tangan nya ditarik Xiumin entah kemana. Ia merasa mereka berada di luar ruangan terlebih lagi udara terasa dingin saat bulan Desember seperti sekarang. Xiumin melepaskan tangan nya. \"Tunggu sebentar.\" ia mengendap-endap kedepan memastikan tidak ada orang di taman belakang rumah pelatih Han. Setelah aman tangan Xiumin bergerak-gerak memanggil You Jung untuk mendekat. Xiumin menoleh ia baru ingat, lantas bergegas menarik kembali lengan You Jung memastikan gadis itu mengikuti nya. \"Dimana ini ?\" You Jung duduk dibangku taman. Bingung. \"Menurut mu ?\" Xiumin balik bertanya. Ia menghempaskan tubuhnya disamping You Jung dan sadar ia akan menerima resiko nya nanti membawa anak gadis itu kabur walau tak jauh. \"Entahlah, aku hanya merasa kita sedang di luar ruangan. Dan lagi apa kita akan kembali tepat waktu ?\" Xiumin melirik jam tangan yang melingkar ditangan kiri nya. Sebelum meringis. \"Tentu saja.\" jawab nya sesantai mungkin walau fakta nya mereka sudah terlambat tujuhbelas menit dari jadwal latihan You Jung dan waktu pulang Xiumin. Mereka berdua diam. Hanyut dalam pikiran masing-masing hingga You Jung bersuara membuat Xiumin kaget sendiri. \"Aku ingin melihat wajah mu, Xiumin.\" ucapnya tulus dari hati terdalam. Duduk berdua saja dengan Xiumin membuat You Jung merasa nyaman sekaligus penasaran bagaimana rupa wajah lelaki yang berhasil masuk kedalam rongga hati nya. Xiumin diam sebentar sebelum meraih tangan You Jung, mengarahkan tangan gadis itu kewajahnya. Agak terkejut You Jung menjauhkan tangan nya sebentar sebelum kembali menyentuh wajah Xiumin dalam diam. Tangan nya berlahan menelusuri seluruh lekuk wajah Xiumin. Ia tersenyum membayangkan betapa rupawan lelaki didepan nya. Xiumin kembali menggenggam tangan You Jung yang tadi diwajahnya, membawa tangan itu mengarah ke dada tepat bagian jantung nya yang memompa darah dua kali lebih cepat dari biasanya. You Jung agak terkejut sebelum senyuman nya semakin lebar. \"Kamu gugup ?\" tanya You Jung polos masih dengan tangan di dada Xiumin. Lelaki itu menggeleng sebagai jawaban walau tahu gadis didepan nya tak akan pernah melihat. \"Aku hanya--\" ucapan Xiumin terpotong. Mata nya melotot melihat pengawal pribadi nya datang beserta kepala pelayan. \"Tunggu! Aku tidak mau pulang.\" seru Xiumin memberontak. Ia berdiri mencoba menjauh dari jangkauan. You Jung mendadak bingung. Kepada siapa Xiumin marah-marah dan membentak seperti itu. Tangannya sudah lepas secara kasar dari Xiumin yang bergerak menjauh. \"Ku bilang aku tidak mau! Mau apa kalian, heh ?! Lepaskan aku, hei! Ku bilang lepaskan.\" dengan sangat terpaksa kepala pelayan keluarga Xiumin memerintahkan anak buah nya menarik paksa anak majikan nya menuju mobil yang siap membawa mereka ketempat tujuan yang seharusnya menjadi jadwal wajib Xiumin setiap hari. Xiumin terus memberontak melawan hak nya. Genggam kuat di kedua tangan kiri dan kanan tak mampu ia lawan, walau begitu Xiumin tak ingin menyerah. Ia hanya ingin menghabiskan waktu lebih lama lagi dengan You Jung. \"Xiumin ? Hei! Xiumin!\" You Jung bangkit. Ia celingak-celinguk sambil meraba sekitarnya. Mendengar teriakan dari Xiumin membuat perasaan nya tidak nyaman. \"Xiumin ?!\" seru You Jung memanggil nama anak lelaki yang sudah dibawa pergi secara paksa oleh anak buah orang tua nya. \"Kamu dimana? Xiumin.\" You Jung tersandung. Tangan nya meraba-raba sekitar mencari benda yang bisa ia pegang. Tangan nya terhenti ke benda seperti botol kecil yang tergeletak naas di rerumputan. \"Xiumin.\" gumam nya pelan menarik botol kecil yang terbuat dari plastik tadi kedalam pelukan nya. Han dari jendela lantai dua mengintip keluar. Hanya beberapa detik sebelum memutuskan menjauh. OoO Berhari-hari bahkan ketika hari memasuki minggu Xiumin tidak pernah muncul lagi sejak hari itu. You Jung tahu Xiumin bukan tipe orang yang melanggar jadwal. Apalagi latihan bersama pelatih Han dan diri nya. Masih menunggu kabar You Jung menggenggam botol kecil yang ia temui saat terakhir kali bertemu dengan Xiumin. Gadis itu bertanya ke salah satu pelayan nya apa isi gerangan botol itu dan ternyata setelah di selidik lebih lanjut isi nya adalah obat penghalang efek samping sekaligus obat sementara. Jadi selama ini Xiumin memiliki penyakit yang You Jung tidak ketahui sama sekali. You Jung merasa seperti orang bodoh. Suara pintu dibuka membuat lamunan You Jung buyar. Gadis itu kembali ke alam nyata, dimana dia sekarang berada di sofa tempat ia biasa menunggu giliran berlatih. Seseorang memasuki ruang tempat piano berada. You Jung masih diam, tidak bersuara karena tak mampu berkata apa-apa saat aroma yang ia kenal menyeruak saat pintu dibuka. Suara piano berlahan terdengar, semakin lama semakin jelas membuat You Jung tidak dapat menahan air mata nya. Ia sangat kenal cara orang ini bermain dan lagu yang ia bawakan sekarang. You Jung tersenyum penuh arti. Hanya sebentar sebelum suara nyaring nan bising memenuhi seisi ruangan. You Jung kaget, ia penasaran dengan apa yang terjadi. \"Xiumin ?\" Tidak ada balasan. \"Xiumin ?\" Suara pintu dan langkah kaki yang terkesan tergesa-gesa kembali mengistrupsi pendengaran You Jung. Ditambah suara panik seorang lelaki paruh baya membuat pikiran You Jung kosong. Ia panik namun bingung. Beberapa menit kemudian keadaan kembali sunyi seperti tidak pernah terjadi apa-apa. You Jung hanya terdiam diatas sofa. Air mata nya berlahan jatuh. Lama kelamaan suara isak tangis terdengar memenuhi ruangan. Han yang memperhatikan nya sejak tadi tidak bisa berkomentar apa-apa. Ia hanya berjalan kearah piano melepas kacamata yang sering ia pakai sebelum memainkan lagu yang pernah dibawakan salah satu murid kebanggaan nya dalam diam. You Jung mendadak terdiam. Ia menutup mulut dengan tangan, menahan isakan yang siap tumpah kapan saja. Walau begitu You Jung tetap berusaha tersenyum menguatkan diri. Dari permainan yang dibawakan pelatih Han sudah cukup menjelaskan semua nya untuk You Jung. Dan gadis itu benar-benar menangis sekarang mengetahui mimpi buruk yang selama ini tidak pernah ia harapkan terwujud sangat cepat. - FIN - ","Summary":" Lantunan piano terdengar lembut dari dalam rumah bergaya Victoria kuno.

Most 2 stories, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, dining room, family room, garage, large backyard. 838 6th Ave. was exactly that type of house. The exterior was white with blue shutters, a car sat outside on the driveway, there were some lawn chairs, a bucket with weeds in it sat, abandoned when the sun got too hot. Windows propped open to let in the barely there breeze of the July afternoon. Inside the suburban home, a piano could be heard. If you were to look into the large picture window that framed the living room, you'd see it, in the corner, jutting out at an angle, pictures in frames sat on the top of it, little trinkets from places they had traveled on there as well. Sheet music half written on, sheets of completed music on the stand in front of it. A tall, elderly gentlemen hunched over it, his gnarled fingers lightly dancing over the keys, knowing most of it by memory, where the keys where, what to play and when, all of it by memory. His tan coat rested on the back of the chair, white shirt sat simply on his frame that seemed to get smaller and smaller each time she saw him. For this man was no ordinary man, this was Wladyslaw Szpilman. Famous pianist. Holocaust survivor. Devoted husband. Father of 2. Now aging and greying, hunched over a piano, the way he had always been. Regina Szpilman wasn't home often, she had decided to leave the nest, going to school in the city at New York University. Studying music. Just like her father. It took most of her time and even though it was a short cab ride away, she didn't make it out as often as she should, too wrapped up in her own life to do more than give her parents a ring every now and again. Her father seemed to be aging faster than she could keep up, her mother was doing a bit better, but not by much. Growing up, Regina's father was quiet, a reserved man, who didn't say much, but when he did, he had a lot to say. His opinion was always taken into consideration. You knew you were in trouble if dad came out and had his \"stern\" voice on. He never got mad, only disappointed. Which was about 10x worse than being mad. Her mother, Carol, would get mad. Not him though, not papa. He would give you a look with those intense eyes of his and shake his head. Carol and Wladyslaw had met when he had come overseas to play with the New York Orcrestrha. Carol at the time had simply been attending a concert, but they had met through a mutual friend, traveled the world touring for several years and finally settled down. Regina at 21 was their youngest. Dennis, their eldest had been at school and then moved to California, he had met some young woman and fallen madly in love. They seldom heard from him. It wasn't until she was about 16, did her father open up to her about what had happened to him. How he and his family had been forced first to wear the armbands with the Star of David on them. How his father had been slapped and forced to walk in the gutter for not bowing. How they had been moved into the ghetto, selling books to make ends meat. How when they were being forced into the box cars, a Jewish Officer had pulled him out and threw him aside, all while he was yelling \"Papa!\" over and over as he watched his family disappear to a labor camp. How he never saw his family again, they were exterminated. All the horrors he had to endure. How people had been kind to him. Some not so kind. The Nazi general who helped save him by bringing him food and giving him his jacket as he left. It was now that she saw the affect all this had taken on him. While he had a great life, she could tell her father was tired. He had gone through so much, much more than any person should ever have to go through for simply being Jewish. It was a familiar sight though. Her father hunched over the piano, fingers playing quickly on the keys. Every once and a while he'd stop and scribble notes onto the blank sheets. \"Papa, why don't you go into the dining room and go eat? Supper is almost ready.\" Regina said softly. Not wanting to scare her father. \"I'll be there in just a moment. I've almost finished.\" He said quietly, his fingers stopping for only as long as necessary. \"Alright, papa.\" She said, walking over to him and kissing his greying head. \"Don't take too long, your chicken will get cold.\" The music started up again. For Regina, the piano had brought her and her father together. Late night teachings, those years when she was a teenager and didn't feel \"normal\", the piano was an escape. It was a way to express herself. It had landed her a scholarship to school and had provided her with comfort in trying times. For Wladyslaw, the piano was his everything. The piano lead him to being youthful again. Took him to a time when he'd play the piano and his mother would sing over family dinners, to a time when he would play it for the Poland radio. A time when his family was together and he had every hope in the world. A place where his family was alive, a place where he could disappear. It had been his only hope during those trying times. When it came winter and he was cold, he would take his numb fingers and play the imaginary piano in front of him. The music sounded in his head as if it was real. The notes twisting and turning, crescendo and decrescendos all moving in his head. For him, the piano was more than just an instrument it was his very elixir of life. You could take away his family, you could take away his food, you could lock him a tiny flat in the middle of winter, you could never take away his music though.

So I saw that at the moment there were only a few Smokin' Aces fanfics so I was like cheyeah let me find out... I do hope that I do some sort of justice. So please reviews & suggestions are more than welcome. Also, I have a music playlist link for this fanfic up on my author's page. Chapter 1 \"The Temporary Flesh and Bone\" My life was how I liked it, I felt as though I had rightfully become content with what I had made for myself. Somehow, today it was relatively (more or less) different; I could feel it creep through my bones and unsettle me, this more than anything managed to unnerve me. The only thing nowadays that I could find some confidence in was the steadfast familiarity in keeping my cool. Nevertheless, I continued to make my daily rounds. I do in fact love my job, not to be misunderstood, I enjoy that I could fall into a role where I could be needed. Although, adversely there was the likely chance that I would take my job home with me, figuratively speaking. There were plenty of nights where I took home my share of heartache and seclusion and sipped at it nicely. Those who were able to sleep lightly when they crossed their doorframe were the privileged few. Today… it was just one of those days where I was fed up. I was weary, sick, and jaded by my fill of shit, vomit, and body hair. Many of my coworkers overcome by \"intellectual\" musings expressed that I was too young to be jaded. But, I was entitled to this disgruntled state, it was a fact of life and I claimed that resignation, mine simply just decided to come along early. The tingling sensation didn't leave my muscles at all and they expressed fatigue all too vocally for my taste. Quite inconspicuously I stretched my arms as the 5-year-old who sat before me looked on at the television obliviously. Spongebob. \"Are you sure it doesn't hurt?\" I murmured, as one tends to do when speaking to a child only capable of innocence. She skittishly licked at her small dried lips as hunger shone in her green eyes. So she nods and made the bravest face as she leaned forward. \"Okay,\" I quietly whispered. It was quite commendable that even so young she possessed a strength and tenacity that I found myself wanting. She was entirely terrified to eat anything, has been since they had taken her off ventilation resulting from a case of hypoxemia almost a week ago. With that I watched as her mouth audibly chomped on the plastic spoon and the Mott's apple sauce retreated as her teeth scraped the smooth surface. \"Good girl.\" I rubbed her hair almost too motherly and I felt the deepest sensation of distress. A gap within me needed so badly to be filled and I saw the all too familiar look of longing reflect in this little girl. It tore at my heart so badly that this was all I was capable of doing to soothe her what with the overwhelming sensation of painkillers pumping through her sought to do. Her tiny fingers rubbed at her sore throat as she fought to respond in her quick short bursts. \"I heard it was your birthday today, Lily Ann.\" A radiant smile raced across her face. She had been in an almost fatal car collision a little over a week ago. She was lucky and the ironic thing was I don't think she could fathom the weight of that. Her hand in its cast flew to conceal her grinning lips, of which I was the first to sign the growing bedazzlement. Lily began to giggle uncontrollably. \"Yes,\" her little feet excitedly jigged beneath the blanket. \"Hmm, I'm gonna be,\" she fell to counting brightly on her small fingers, \"six!\" She nodded profusely, all the while beaming up at me brilliantly. \"Well, it seems that you're a big girl now then, eh. I was going to give you a little something but now I don't know…\" I chimed sing songy. It was as if a small fire had lit and sent my spirit flying. \"Nooo,\" she fumbled a bit before rushing to her knees to clasp her arms about my neck. \"I won't tell, okay.\" Her warm, sweet breath rushed against my skin. She whispered hoarsely and her head bobbed freely. I pretended to ponder the thought for a minute then lowered my voice to her conspiratorial note. \"I guess you can't tell then. Our little promise, ok?\" We pinky swore on that and I flipped back the far end of her blanket to withdraw a cloth doll. \"I hope you like it. Plus good news, we take the stitches out today,\" I wiggled my eyebrows and showered her face with hugs and kisses and ran my fingers across the dry, stitched skin on the back of her hand. Immediately as she could be free from my hold, she snatched the doll from my fingertips and drew it into herself. A lump caught in my throat instantly and I looked at her for quite some time. Gently her hands stroked the brightly colored fabric. She whispered lovingly and continued on crooning quietly. \"She's going to be here, okay?\" She looked up at me and all I saw was emptiness. I smoothed her light blond hair behind her ears and kissed her forehead. \"Your mom's going to be here, I promise you this. Hey,\" I propped her chin up, \"look at me. It's okay to miss her. But don't cry anymore, okay?\" I hugged her tightly to my chest and we both curled up on her hospital bed. Our coloring contrasted the other nicely, hers a creamy pale and mine a deep, even toffee. I wrapped her little fingers in mine and offered as much comfort as I could through our enlaced fingers. We both were so broken, two pieces in this ambiguous world and I only prayed she would suffer in this world far less than I had; as I still continued to do up until this very day. She held within her such a kind of purity that I wanted to desperately protect. She had in her an integrity that I wanted so badly to preserve. I saw so much that I had sacrificed. In her I saw myself. Subtle sobs wracked her body and I held her even closer. I felt wretched to have promised something I didn't even know how to keep. It took so much from me to give the seemingly effortless kindness, warmth that she needed so much. I had spent far too long severing my emotions that it ultimately left me all too vulnerable, regardless. I felt I wasn't capable of truly disregarding my inhibitions but I tried for her sake. My small sacrifices paled in worth in comparison to what she was. She had barely escaped her death. Her mother was far luckier to have escaped without as much as a mark on her body. If it were up to me, her place would have promptly been traded. I placed a kiss on her forehead and watched her fall into sleep. * I exited the room, thankfully without any kind of protest from her sleeping frame. At a loss, I wiped at welling tears. Her mother stood nearby looking just as displaced as I was feeling. She had an arm draped across her already swelling womb, absentmindedly nibbling at her fingertips. \"It's my fault,\" she gasped brokenly. \"I should be in there right now, not my baby. You know I told her I didn't love her that day…\" Her fingers came to a still over her lips. \"She hates me.\" Slowly I rubbed my damp fingers across my scrubs. \"Kathryn – ah Ms. Delgato it might not be my place to say this to you but right now she needs her mother. Right now, regardless of any kind of reticence she needs you,\" in that moment I felt myself begin to unravel and I couldn't control the overwhelming emotions that seeped into my voice, \"for you to comfort her to reassure her that you love her… and that everything's going to be okay.\" She stared at me blankly for a moment. \"Thank you,\" she squeezed her eyes shut and a few drops leaked down her face. She looked through the door's windows then back at me. \"I saw you with her earlier\" her tone was thickened by phlegm, \"you two looked so natural, so good. Oh God… I couldn't go in because when and if I do then it's all gonna hit me.\" Kathryn shook her head furiously, \"I almost lost her. I don't deserve her.\" You don't deserve to be a mother . I wanted to scream that to her twisted face. But as with life, sometimes you didn't get to choose who got what. I simply said, \"Well, that doesn't matter now.\" I shuffled pass her to open the door to Lily Ann's room. Go , I mouthed. With nothing further to say she made her way into the room, peeled off her jacket, then leaned to kiss her daughter awake. I took great solace in these stolen moments. They came too few and infrequent in my life. Envy and happiness rung in my heart and I felt that I was grateful for this day. Slowly, I walked away with my hands clasped behind my back. Sometimes I felt as though I didn't know what to think. At times I was so tightly coiled and constrained I could barely function. Listlessly I looked on at the unfolding hallway, swiping my badge across the sensor and took the stairs two at a time. * Begrudgingly, I always slated this particular stop for the last of my rounds. To me it always seemed as if all the other NA's seemed to pass the undesirables off unto me due to my lack of seniority or more decidedly due to a complete conspiracy of favoritism. So surreptitiously his bed was rejected by a majority of the staffed to settle on my shoulders. Anyway, I bit my gall and ensued on the current course. By the time I got to my destination I was taxed and looking forward to the end of the day. Well, this was in a way a kind of assessment for me, a sort of reflection of sorts. JOHN DOE, I thumbed through his charts. They and taken him off ventilation this morning. \"Hey John,\" I looked at his still frame nonchalantly figuring how to go about my duties. \"Long time no see.\" I secured a stray lock behind my ear, peering into his square face. Everyone knew quite well who this man was, it was purely for the sake of security issues that his identity was kept mum, thinly veiled at that. I brushed the hair away from his forehead and for a minute I let myself be drawn in by his subdued features. My fingers trailed lightly across the beard that dusted his face lightly. His crude Mohawk was growing out in patches. He was so still, lifeless. Anyone would be terrified of death after seeing this. No one deserved this. That was even a far bound for me because at the moment a few faces flitted before me. I took to him in a way which frightened me. I cleaned his body, I tended his bedsores, and I promised myself that he was the moral corruption and defilement of all sanctity. But those thoughts were only futile; I would always be drawn in by his kind. I watched him die then make his way back to life as he fought off a secondary infection. He still had plenty of fight left in him. \"You're not so bad are you?\" \"It won't be smooth sailing until a while John. Yeah, ditto.\" A smile deepened and eased the nerves in my face. I fell into a rhythm and began to undress him and continued our little one-sided banter, \"Yeah I don't think I'd imagine this for myself either but the bedsores aren't that bad. Just kidding, you don't have any, well if it weren't for me now… It'll take more than terrible humor to kill you, won't it?\" I ran the cool sponge over his bared skin. A flush heated my skin as I tried to be as professional as I could muster up for some sort of decency. He was quite handsome now that I considered it. Quite so, with hooded brow shading a concealed cool color, high cheekbones, and full lips. Uneasily I shoved that thought from my mind. \"It's odd but sometimes I really feel that you're the only friend I have in this world…\" I was a bit taken aback by my own admission but no one was here to tell my secrets. I was scared and I felt that more than anything. Anyone with a heavy past or present, for them this was a constant weight and shame. Quickly I wiped at a tear with the back of my hand. \"Sorry for leaking all over you, DT.\" Hastily I finished up with only a nurse interrupted momentarily to check is vitals and made her log. We exchanged a tepid acknowledgement before she left. I made a mental check list to stop by the grocery store and cleaners on my way home. Time always moved as quickly as you needed it to when not contemplating time. \"I'll have to give you a shave next time,\" I chimed while patting his shoulder. With a lingering stare over my shoulder I left the room. The guard on duty apparently was already on break. At this point and time I would've done anything for a warm shower to weed out the kinks. Maybe it was the fact that I had an incredible innate sense of intuition but I could feel my nerve endings stand on end whenever Michael approached. A fellow Nursing Assistant, unfortunately he wasn't the kind you wanted to be around. He was lookable (yes on my scale of tolerableness) but you wanted to steer clear of his hands if you get what I mean. \"Not today, Michael. I'm not in the mood; yes I'm on my period with severe period cramps.\" I said the first male deterrent that seemed feasible in his ever working mind. \"Don't they have shit for that?\" He scratched at his head lamely and continued to follow me into the locker area. He did posses a kind of decency for he waited outside half-shouting our unfinished conversation through the door. \"So what are you doing tonight?\" \"Well, nothing Mike. I'm just a little exhausted. Bekka's a bitch and wants to make my life a little more complicated by fucking overbooking me,\" I yelled back at him. I didn't waste any time in shrugging on a sweat shirt and grabbing my keys. \"She just likes you, is all.\" \"Really? Well, I surely would prefer not to have any of her loving at all then.\" He followed me back out into the hallway. \"But yeah, just give me a rain check for,\" I thought for a second, \"this weekend maybe?\" \"'K babe. Santi you better not forget, I'm holding you to this one.\" He gave me a sheepish grin before heading off in the opposite direction. The sky unfolded in a tumultuous grey as I weaved through the parking lot to make my way to my car. The day would soon be over and all the worries that were in me I relinquished and let it slide from my weary body.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 \"Unknown Distance to the Great Beyond\" Today would be far longer than the previous day; there was a telling in my bones. Yesterday rolled off into a hazy distance as I replayed it through my mind. My usual schedule was exactly what it was, extremely tight and calculated with little room for variation. It was best this way, easier for me to monitor the slightest of glitches that could alter the peace I had made for myself. The drive home had been easy, surprisingly so seeing that the streets were ever congested. I made a quick stop at the cleaners to pick up a dress I barely exercised. It was the most expensive piece in my wardrobe and deservingly I had bought it when it had gone on sale. What can I say, black suited me well. The one occasion I decided to don it spitefully rewarded me with a nice stain. Afterwards, I ventured on to the grocery store. I walked in, sweeping my lengthy coarse hair into a neat ponytail; I would have to get a trim soon. Bread, nuts, lettuce, cold cuts, and a few frozen dinners, mentally I flipped through my checklist. Yogurt, fruit, taco meat, milk. Personally, I preferred to have diversity when it came to my food and also to appease my weekly binges. A child hanging unto a shopping cart peered up at me with moon eyes. I smiled brightly back, saying Hi . She reminded me vaguely of Lily Ann which in turn brought a sharp stitch to my heart. I checked out then went outside. Home smelt just as impersonal as a hospital and although it wasn't much it was mine. I kept it neat and as bare as possible, nothing much of me in it. I preferred dark furniture (precisely dark mahogany) and the modern form; it was pleasing to the eye. Quietly I stepped out of my white loafers, leaving them by the door. I promptly popped a Stouffer's Lasagna into the oven and shrugged out of my clothes to take a quick shower. Within ten minutes I was curled up on the sofa and flipped on the television. CNN, Spongebob, I Love the '80s (didn't catch what year), Lifetime. Food Network was good, so I let it rest on that. I ate a hot chunk of lasagna, reminding myself to take some down the hall to Keith at a later time. We were dinner buddies although we both had fallen off the wagon for the past couple of weeks, due to mutually clashing obligations. I checked my cell phone for messages receiving nothing apart from a few silly disgruntled texts from Mike. Then I went on to sift through my answering machine, I already knew the outcome for that. * I couldn't waste another moment of lounging in bed. I got up softly padding about in the staple of t-shirt and undies. On schedule, I showered then grabbed a Toaster Strudel coupled with a glass of cold milk. Green and pink scrubs, my favorite. Soon I moved on to straighten up a bit feeling as though I should actually let my apartment get dirty for once. I had a few hours until work so I could get a few errands out of the way. On the drive to the hospital I pondered what I would have for dinner later on tonight. Maybe I would try something new, shrimp scaloppini possibly? I had the taste for something Italian. Without lingering too much with a few passersby, I checked in and begun my set of rounds. Today in particular my shift was moved down late and cut a few hours short. I relished that simply for the fact that it was a Friday and maybe a few drinks were in my horizon with a couple of buddies I had been neglecting of late. It had been a while since I had fun. I scarcely was familiar with the word; I avoided it like the plague. There would be three beds until I got to see Lily. Ritchie was surprising placated by the time I saw him today. He was in his mid-thirties and could pass for being good-looking if he ever shaved his beard. He liked me, I could tell because he enjoyed my ministrations a little bit too much. \"Veta Santi, I'd love to take you home to my mom,\" he gibed playfully. I rolled my eyes when not in his eyeshot. At present he was recovering from surgery, heroically donating a piece of liver to someone he barely knew, well a distant cousin was distant enough. \"Well I don't know about that one, love. I'm a shrew 95% of the time.\" \"Lucky for you I like shrews. They're kinda cute. Certified Nursing Assistant,\" he thumbed by name tag listlessly. He was impossible and persistent. I looked at the thick coat of dark beard which shaded his lower jaw. \"Is this for the beard festival? How's the whole rugged thing working out for ya?\" Ritchie played with the tip of his beard then reached for my hand, completely ignoring my teasing. \"So how 'bout it then? You, me; meeting up after I ditch this joint.\" \"I don't think that'll be quite ethical and I am a woman of standards,\" I gave a light shrug. \"Plus you certainly won't be 'ditching this joint' any time soon and you'd have to be like up there on the 'tolerableness scale.'\" \"I pegged you for a woman that didn't need or see any kind of boundaries. So, where exactly am I on this scale? Of course I would have to be at a quite sufficient number in order for you to be so obviously flirting with me. Hey, it's a European thing,\" he explained all too confidently. I gave a deep sigh. \"I'm not going to answer that.\" I swatted at his legs. I did my duties, even giving his beard a light trim much to his displeasure. \"Eight,\" I offhandedly offered. \"Out of?\" \"Eleven, yes my standards are quite high.\" \"Ooh, she has my heart. I do clean up real good, you'll see.\" \"Okay, Ritchie. You be good and I'll see you, 'kay.\" It took me a while to escape his blatant entrapments to keep me lingering in his room. Lily's mother was with her when I got there. They were both enshrouded in a mother daughterly bond, which managed to stir the kind of emptiness that seemed to stay with me these days. Kathryn was the first to see me. \"Oh hello. Uhmm I'll be taking care of Lily today.\" \"That's fine, ma'am.\" Instantly my heart sunk, Lily was an immediate favorite of mine and it kind of rocked me substantially not to see her so abruptly. She knitted her fingertips together timidly. \"But, you could stay… and talk with her a while. The baby's been protesting quite a bit so I'll just stretch my legs for a minute,\" she stated rubbing her belly. I was still recovering from shock when she exited the room. \"Hey, Veta.\" Lily was up on her feet and dancing about on her bed. She leapt into my arms and I held her tightly. Apparently they had taken her off the IVs. \"Hey to you too Lily Ann. It's good to see you.\" I kissed the top of her head loudly. \"My mommy got me a new book!\" She bobbed up and down in my arms excitedly. \"Really? Let me see!\" \"I can only look at the pictures, so you're gonna 've to read.\" Kathryn was conveniently gone for almost ten minutes but when she returned a big smile was plastered on her face. \"Sorry to cut us short, but I'm going to need to move on Miss Lily Ann.\" She pouted a bit. \"Look your mom's going to be here and I promise I'll see you next week. Promise?\" She shook her head and scrambled from my lap. On my way out I looked quietly spoke to her mother. \"Thank you for that. You didn't have to… but I really appreciated it.\" Kathryn simply raised a hand, \"That's not necessary. She really likes you and I can see that you clearly care for her as well. So it's more for her and she needs people around her that make her happy. So I'm the one who should be thanking you, especially for being there when I couldn't have been.\" There wasn't anything I could say to that for it moved me so deeply I couldn't find any words to possibly say to her. We shook hands and I moved on. * I made it to the third floor and thankfully was going to look in on the last bed. It wasn't on my rounds this particular late afternoon but I felt obligated to at least go in and check on him, to at least see if there weren't any scalpels shoved up his arms. The guard usually posted at the door was increasingly becoming more and more nonexistent. They really thought he wasn't going to wake up. Primarily, in the throes of the Nomad Casino massacre the hospital was turned on its head. They had moved the patient, under the current alias of John Doe, from across town to here, Mount Vine Hospital after receiving multiple threats at the chief hospital. The atmosphere had been so immensely tense, rippling throughout the city. So hopefully at present, his current whereabouts remained undisclosed. At first there were plenty enough guards on duty but I'd be lucky to spot at least two on the same floor. That number dwindled with the growing weeks to a solitary figure who most likely was at the moment chasing tail or feeding his belly. A wave of unease passed over me but I collected myself knowing that the work day would soon be over. I stopped in front of the door and gently turned the knob and opened it. My eyes gravitated to the farther right side of the room where a man stood in the manner of dressing. \"I'm sorry but visiting hours are…\" It dawned on me after looking out of my peripheral that there was an empty bed. Fuck . Shock, then recognition took a hold of me. It was a miracle that he was even awake, let alone standing (more like a haunch) clad in a black dress jacket, skinny jeans, and boots. It surprised me at how quickly he moved and in an instant he was clutching me from behind, his body tightly pressed into mine. \"Sssh, naw you don't say a word. Don't you even move that pretty little face a yers.\" His hot breath raced across the back and side of my neck. The hairs on his face tickled my skin. He latched unto me quite firmly and fear left me breathless. My chest heaved in a constricted fashion as air burned its way through the building nausea, \"Please… don't.\" I was terrified. \"You hush up.\" He sounded just as fragile as I imagined he would be. I would've fought my way out of his grasp save for the syringe that was against my neck. \"Now you be a good girl 'n you won't need to worry 'bout all that.\" I felt his dry lips press against the back of my neck. A whimper escaped from me. \"Sssh.\" \"Look, I- I'll do anything you ask… just don't hurt me.\" \"Now, that's what I want to hear,\" he drawled as his body was wracked with a fit of coughing. He wiped the spittle away with the back of his hand. Slowly he backed me towards the hospital bed. My mind raced madly out of desperation. I promised myself that I wouldn't lose it. Suddenly it had become all too surreal and it seemed as though wherever I ended up ill fortune would be right behind me waiting. \"'K you just sit tight an' let me figure this one out.\" He began pacing the floor, hobbling at an uncomfortable tempo. \"Alright, now you – what we're gonna is we're gonna just dosy on and just walk on out of here. He was quite insane. \"There's no way-.\" I shut my mouth at the look he sent in my direction. I idly looked down at my hand contemplated what to do next. He was clearly weak but I made a mental note that I wanted to make it out of this in one piece. A little piece of me felt wronged at worst. Afterall, I had taken care of him for the couple of months that he had been here. Ensured him his nourishment, bathed him, offered what a heavy heart would never had done but I couldn't say this to him. \"Get up.\" I must've hesitated a little too long because he was clambering over to me in seconds. His fist brutally encircled my arm and shakily pulled me up. He threw the syringe across the room and eyed me suspiciously. \"Now don't you try anything,\" he fumbled through his pocket to retrieve a scalpel (I had no idea where he could've gotten that). A bit roughly he shoved me towards the door and began pulling at the hem of my shirt. \"Calm down, I ain't gonna hurt you. Unless I 've to,\" he added for some authority. He extended his hand around my waist and rested the blade against my hip. * I'd never been so afraid in my life. There might've been past experiences but this took the cake at the moment. \"Slow down 'kay. If you're gonna do this at least be smart about it. I'll get you as far as the parking lot,\" I stared directly into his eyes. \"I can almost guarantee you that. I don't want anyone getting hurt on my account. If you're going to blindly go into this, it's good as done as me screaming bloody murder at the top of my lungs. I don't know about you but today sure doesn't feel like a good day to die.\" He thought about this for a second, breathing heavily and brushing his matted hair out of his face. \"'Kay, sounds like a plan to me lady.\" \"Good. Now we would have a good chance of taking the stairs, the least traffic and less of a chance of us being seen.\" I wanted so badly to fuck him over but I chickened out, I was too terrified of what might happen if I didn't succeed. We both walked the remainder of the slender hallway, all the while me futilely making an attempt to have as little contact with his body. I was practically keeping his exhausted body afloat. And so I bided my time. I swiped my badge across the red dot of the security lock. I pushed against the heavy door and we entered the stairwell. Now was my time. The scalpel only nipped me a bit as I slammed backwards into his slim frame. He let out a grunt and I ran, I didn't care how careless I was all that mattered was the distance that I was putting between us. Never did I believe in Karma until this day. It turned out that in the space of such an insignificant period I would suffer what I carried from the previous life into this one. It was as simple as watching a computer crash or just seeing something as well simply cease to exist. The power flitted and its life ended. Red light illuminated everything and my blood ran thick liquid metal within my veins. Shit. The doors were shut. Come on, come on the generator should kick in any minute now. A thick gust of wind broke from my mouth as his thin fingers fixed into my hair and slammed me into the door. My body sagged sickeningly, my mind rushed, and saliva collected in my mouth. \"Uggh, please!\" \"I thought we had a deal,\" his body slumped over unto mine. This time the blade returned beneath my collarbone. \"S-sorry, it won't happen again.\" He gave me another meaningful shove. \"What now?\" Before I could begin to analyze our immediate predicament the lights dimmed then booted up. I could hear the locks reset. I licked at my now dry lips. \"Okay, I think we have to make it quick. We might have to our advantage that it most likely will be chaos in the corridors. Just please,\" my hands flew up, \"don't do anything stupid. I'll get us out here in one piece, I promise.\" I said that last bit more for myself. I wanted very badly to convince myself that we could pull this off. We stepped out into the hallway and as suspected nurses, doctors, staff and even a few patients were dipping in and out of rooms and stragglers were wandering the corridors. I didn't pay attention to any of it. My Captor, he had his own head dipped so that his chin was almost nestled against his chest. \"Be calm, 'kay. Don't be so tense. Now we can make it out cleanly here from the second floor,\" I lowered my voice to a whisper \"in the south wing the stairs lead directly out into the parking lot from the Smithson Lobby.\" He looked about nervously, \"If you're worried about the cameras probably they went out with the power outage. Of course I mean what I say that I'll help you, there's a blind spot in the south wing. Just pray shit doesn't hit the fan because I have just as much to lose as you do.\" We blended right on in with the chaos. I don't think I should've been so pleased that we were getting away this Scott free. The descent down the second flight of stairs went well, I didn't try anything. The lobby, much to my discontent, was deserted. The raw scent of rain filled the small space, the sound of the pellets resonated and ate up the silence. \"Gimme your keys,\" he demanded. I didn't hesitate at his request. \"Come on.\" \"No, I told you as far as the parking lot!\" \"I'm not gonna repeat myself y' hear. Just shut it and come the fuck on.\" He gritted his teeth through the pain. His fingertips bit into my arm. Outside looked grey and foreboding. \"Okay,\" I nodded. The heavy showers slapped against our bodies brutally, nearly dragging both of us to the ground. He placed most of his unto my smaller frame. \"It's the Chevy Avalanche. The slate one.\" We made our way to the parked vehicle in due time, most of our worries forgotten for the moment. Water and wind had assaulted us brutally so that I could hardly feel my face. My clothes were so heavy and my limbs were solely kept up on fear and perseverance. I pulled open the passenger side and tucked him in. Quickly, I sprinted around and sat in the driver's seat. \"Okay,\" I calmly let out peeling away the hair that was plastered to my face. I was practically soaked to the bone. He audibly shivered next to me. \"Here are the keys. I'm out from here on. Take my car and you get your head start, that's all I can that I can do for you.\" \"Drive,\" he writhed in agony and I looked into his weary face and at his silver capped teeth. \"Just go!\" \"That wasn't the fucking plan! I'm not getting in your shit.\" The acidity seethed through my pores. \"Well girly –ugh- I guess I'm here to fuck shit up. Now get the fuck on with it.\" I challengingly peered into his face. \"Okay, genius. Where the hell are we supposedly headed. Oh, and just for future reference I'm not much of a bargaining hostage chip.\" \"Take me to your place, then.\" His expression was torn between pure distress and mischief. \"You are unbelievable.\" * Carefully, we entered into my apartment. The ride over was as awkward as it could be. I was so terribly tempted into slamming into a mailbox or whichever object that was amusing at the time. The windshield wipers droned on deafeningly. His body had gone immobile and I prayed that it was something close to death. My fingers bit into the steering wheel, desperately not knowing what else to do. I bit on my bottom lip and decided to pay better attention to the slick road. Right now this definitely fell under the category of aiding and abetting, yeah at least I thought so. The worst was I actually didn't feel in the wrong for trying (more so that I was ) to help this man. He was despicable, morbid, and in the sub human class but yet I couldn't find myself associating with the emotions that usually accompanied those presumptions. The simple fact was whichever way I wanted to put it, I was fucked. \"Lay down,\" I helped him rest his body on the couch then busied myself with gathering blankets. The rain had eased up on our way here but now it had released the crest of its fury. We were both soaked and the weaker of the two of us might just as well face the risk of pneumonia or hypothermia at best. \"I need to get you out of these wet clothes.\" I didn't wait for any kind of consent I just dove right into it. I placed a blanket over the couch then eased him up a bit to unpeel the clothing that took to him like a vise. The jacket went first then the t-shirt he wore beneath. They were incredibly soiled and heavy from the rain and prior activity; they fell to the ground with a wet, sickly thud. I dragged the jeans from his lean legs. He remained frighteningly silent, his eyes sagging. \"Almost done, okay?\" I tucked away stray locks of my hair, promising my worn body that I would get to it eventually. I gently wrapped his shaking body with two blankets. My limbs couldn't take me much further but I made it to my bedroom, gratefully. Someone up there was on my side. I smelled faintly of dew, mingled sweat, and the day's toll. I shed my own soaked clothing, then curled up naked underneath the comforters and blankets on my bed. Sleep desperately wanted me. I didn't sleep well, I usually never did. The rain still continued to pound restlessly unto everything outside. I got up, dragging a blanket about me and peered outside. Everything was coated in the downfall. A fulfilling yawn escaped me and had me stretched out to the tips of my toes. It was good. Gladly, I looked at the clock to see that I hadn't been out for that long. I took the hot shower that my body was begging for. I got the grime out my hair and stress off my body. I got some ground Starbucks coffee beans to percolate. My home was eerily silent; although there was always a silent existence to it but it was different, more like a silent anticipation. I almost had forgotten my charge. It was apparent that his sleep was as fitful as mine, if not more. Small spasms rocked his sleeping body. I turned the television on, putting it on mute. He snored lightly. A few minutes later he began to stir a bit. I rushed over to his side and looked down at him worriedly. His features had been pacified to what I was used to, I brushed back his brown hair. \"You're not the monster you claim to be, are you Darwin?\" I tested the statement over and over in my mind, I was grasping at straws attempting to get myself out of where I had settled. I traced the lines that stressed his face lightly. His full lips gathered then his eyes fluttered groggily. And I stared into those crystal depths. Such an intense blue when the light hit it, emitting an expansive spectrum of blue to a greenish blue. They were the most pleasant feature to him and they held me in place. For so long I had imagined what they would look like peering up back at me. What I felt when I looked at him was sympathy and maybe I was the monster for condoning what he was. He retched terribly and all I could do was hold him place. I was so frightened I was at a loss of what to do. \"Why you being so good to me?\" He simply inquired. Within him I could see his mind conspiring and his walls already setting up. His body began shaking and a light film of sweat coated his upper body. I looked at him for a long, silent moment, \"The truth? I don't know.\" What I wanted to know was what was wrong with me. I ran my hands over his heated skin, slightly furrowing my brows in response. With some haste I sprang to my feet and went in search of a thermometer. \"Open,\" I slipped it beneath his tongue. \"People don't do shit for just no reason.\" He fought past the pain and the murkiness that threatened to envelop him again. \"Then what am I asking of you then? You walk out of here and you're all but dead you hear me. And maybe you'd deserve that.\" His hands flew up defeated, \"Okay, I might've deservingly walked into that one.\" I withdrew the stick, quite roughly so. Tsking, I looked back at him. \"I don't like this. You're temp has spiked severely.\" I ran a frustrated hand through my hair. \"I don't know what to do –I- I don't know… Your fever - It must be some kind of reaction to the antibiotics to fight off your infection. Shit.\" I looked about me overcome half by circumstance half defeat. \"We need to get you cooled off, come on.\" I helped him to shaky feet. \"Aw, shit.\" \"Oh gosh, what am I going to do with you?\" We made it to the bathroom and I slid back the shower door. Thank God it was a walk in. I turned the water on and set it to a comfortable and cool temperature. He slumped over on me and I hoisted him in, with me partially in as well. \"Shit. Fuck me!\" He continued on to ramble and grope at me in his brief state of delirium. \"Okay, take it easy.\" The shower pelted us sweetly and we stayed that way for some time, wrapped together tightly. I smoothed back his hair and ran my hands over his skin to see if his temp had regulated some. Afterwards I got both of us out and had him perching on the toilet seat. I got out towels. \"How are you holding up over there,\" I called out over my shoulder. \"I'll still kicking. I feel like shit on a hot day though.\" Yeah you look it too , I smiled on the inside. His eyelids lowered and his head leaned back and a dispassionate look washed his face. He sat there completely naked and oblivious to the world. \"It's rainin' cats, dogs, and democrats out there ain't it. The rain… I can just hear it, tellin' me it's coming through the walls just breathin' and listening. Waiting to take it all in, all a us.\" I stood in front of him soaking up most of the moisture from my hair. I stood there, listening to our breathing. His eyes danced beneath the lids and all I could wonder was what it felt like in his head. I wanted to be disgusted by the tattoos that marked his body, the creed and oath he stood for, but I just didn't. To my dissatisfaction I was all used up when it came to hating. There was too much of it gone and diluted into other disciplines that it was all but gone. In the end there was little that I could feel for anyone and I guarded so forcefully what I could afford myself. Every muscle in his body went still and his body fell into the slumber it was craving. I took in every sinew and curve shamelessly, I could tell the multiple shades to his hair, mark the scars that embellished him. There was so much that his flesh could tell and I wanted that story. He was shrewd and ruthless and he didn't hide it. That I envied of him, he could show the world what he was undauntedly. Some were unlucky in this life and had to screen whatever it was within them; those were the ones that nurtured the bitter sweet rewards of life. His eyes opened and held me fast in place. Lithely he molded himself to me, resting his head against my abdomen and breasts. I offered him the only comfort I could by sliding my fingertips into his hair, gently kneading the tender skin. He might've been subdued but cunningly a hand cupped my breast. I pushed his hand away. \"Seriously? I might be accommodating you but don't get fresh.\" Nonchalantly he withdrew his hands as his eyes raked in the damp fabric covering my body. \"Couldn't hurt none by trying,\" he shrugged. \"Next time I'll slap you then.\" I was furious. \"So there's a invitin' for a next time then?\" **[Chapter 3] A/N: This is sort of a filler, kinda yup. So I've had this sitting on my comp for far too long the chap was intended to be way longer but I had to break it up (so no I have not given up on this one). Hopefully the next update will be much sooner. Between getting ready to move and procrastinating I had left this one alone for a while. So to all that have read, reviewed (much love), put this betch on alerts and favs my heart goes out to you and hope that you stay on. Thank you! Chapter 3 \"No No No, I'll Hurry When I'm Home\" If I hadn't worried prior to the evening's events then I was surely worrying right about now. The weight of my decisions had finally hit me and there was nothing that I could possibly do to recant past deeds. I was scared shitless and I wrung my hands and bit into my fingernails, a habit that of recent I picked up. Today was Saturday by looking at the clock, it was a quarter after two in the morning, and I a good six to eight hours ago was contemplating getting drunk good and dandy into the wee hours of the morn. Well, so much for displaced optimism. The sanguinity that had brimmed upon the horizon now receded into the valleys and I was left with indefinitely bleak weeks. Sometimes, if I tried hard enough, I could almost forget about the evidence that was sprawled upon my new seats underneath my blankets. But that would all be too good to be true. This was a heavy stain that didn't have that kind of decency to simply let itself be washed out. I felt useless in times of immense distress and I let myself tidy whatever I could get a hold on. Nonetheless, I could run on quite few hours of sleep. My body no longer hungered for what it had grown unaccustomed to, since my calculative skills became more efficient under anxiety. I shrugged into some sweats. He slept well, I begrudgingly noted to myself. I could quietly go in and help him wonder off with his ill gotten dreams and that would be all of it, I thought cruelly. I would be done with it all, my hands wiped clean and no one would be the wiser of it. Heavily those thoughts brushed themselves aside. So with nothing left to do I sat close by him and divided my attention between flipping through the television channels on mute and looking at his still body. My mind contemplated certain actions and as always I came up short handed and battling with my sense of morality. I pondered at his colorful past. I wondered at how many lives he had taken, how many children he had deprived of their sanctity in a stable home. That much had left me feeling hypocritical. I wondered at what he thought as he took in my skin and appraised my worth. Where was his creed and substance now? And most of all, where would that get him? Of course nowhere, that had forsaken him the moment he faced his judgment atop the hotel. When he looked at me he would see the momentary escape to get him closer to his liberation. And when I really thought about it, I didn't know if I wanted to let him attain it. Was I prepared to kill him? Yes, I was. If need be at least. Looking at him I knew there was more fight left when he chose this path, or more so now that I had chosen to assist him. Again the question arose that I couldn't answer. Why am I doing this? Out of sympathy; certainly not in any form. At times I felt nothing short of disgust when I looked at him. I felt myself drift off and I succumbed to the lethargy that soothed my body. I would dream as well, inwardly as well outwardly I smiled. Perhaps they would be peaceful. * I didn't know what the hell I was doing, I was desperate and that would only lead to carelessness. And why the fuck was it so damn hot? My skin was slick, beads slowly forming on my forehead and nose as I thought of the task at hand. My breaths were now even shallower. I ran my tongue over my lips, tasting the salt and scented lotion on my skin. He was so still. Out cold. I felt like a lecherous crook in the night hounding at an oblivious prey. Quite cautiously I tip-toed closer across the cold floor tugging up the pant legs even more gingerly to half straddle his hips. Shit , the air escaped from the entire room when he stirred a bit. I settled more comfortably before extracting the pair of handcuffs tucked away in my waistband (don't ask). Lower lip caught between my teeth and cold sweats completely washing over me I eased his furthest arm to a more accessible reach. His skin was roasting and I fought the strong urge to release my hold. The longest two minutes in my whole damn life. I wiped away the light film from my face. I prayed to myself as the cool metal clicked in place, great halfway through. There were so many things racing in my mind. We locked gazes for second or two before his free hand went tearing at my upper body. Desperately I struggled to trap his shackled arm and wrangle the other. He might've been inebriated and drunk with fever but his thin body in its desperation was brutal for a means of escape. We went all wild and groovy in that little chair. My own body became feral and reverted to old habits. But before I could make a lick of anything my legs were up in the air and I was crashing into the floor solidly, the wind rushing out of me. There were a few oh shits in between what the fucks but I regained my mind as soon as the sharp pain made its peak then flowed into its dwindling subtle ebb. I couldn't even recover quite fully when he was set on me, crushing my diaphragm. Again I slapped wildly at where ever I could get to. \"Get the fuck off me!\" I screeched when I could afford little air. He perched on my chest a little more comfortably. \"Calm down girl,\" he said it a bit nonchalantly as though by each moment he grew increasingly disinterested with the whole ordeal. Darwin had a hand pinning both mine across my chest. He fixed to become more at ease and pinned one of my arms beneath his shins. He quite relished the struggle of strength and was far more excited as I finally settled into resignation. \"Now if you don' stop all the bitching I'm- Fuck!\" He spat the blood from his mouth then went on to cuff his wrist to mine. I smiled to myself at the small victory which was only short lived. \"I ain't gonna hit no woman.\" He chuckled a bit at my audacity, \"No matter how much you asking for it.\" He held up his arm and in a terribly synchronized jerk mine followed his. \"Now what kind a freaky shit you coming up with? Sure nuff I would be laughing my head off lack I knew what that was all about.\" He smiled down into my face and I could only be forced to look up. I didn't like that I was on the receiving end of the amusement of this… this backwater, probably inbred, felon. \"It's not funny just get the fuck up off me!\" He clucked his tongue, \"Now if you wanna get all mean like that.\" He leaned in and I could feel his hot, heavy breath rolling unto me. I turned my face away in disgust. \"I'm going to have to stop being nice with you.\" He nuzzled a bit at my neck, pawing at my skin teasingly. His skin was moist and heat enveloped him. \"Darwin I mean it! Get off! You're gonna have paste for fucking balls-\" He stilled my lips by coolly pinching them between a thumb and forefinger. This managed to still my fighting nerves into a kind of submission, but only for the moment. He cocked his head to the side. \"Sssh, I was trying to be pleasant and sleeping like a fucking babe on a tit but you just want to get all foul and shit so I'm going to have to lay down the law.\" His eyes held its familiar glaze over the icy orbs; he clearly fought very hard to hold himself together. I struggled beneath him as best as I could. It was futile and even more humiliating to have him have the upper hand and be all saccharine about it. \"I'm gonna kick you in the vagina if you don't keep still,\" he stated almost congenially. My eyes peeled open painfully in disbelief. \"You wouldn't dare,\" I breathed uneasily. \"I wouldn't now?\" He challenged calmly. In exasperation I pulled at our fastened limbs and in utter defeat I rested my fingertips on the nearby couch. Seeing that I had come to some kind of sense he settled a bit, \"Now what the fuck was that all for? You're lucky I didn't feel like slapping your ass around.\" A low hiss escaped through my teeth. \"I didn't trust you. I still don't. Just- please get off, I think you might've given me a fucking concussion.\" I rolled my eyes and looked back at his gaze which was laced with expectancy. His face warped with contempt. He assumed a more rich persona, his body language and twang far more exaggerated, \"There I was feeling all like a big man, proud that they was a woman like you jus a' hoping for sex with me.\" He made a slight movement, gyrated his crotch against my abdomen. His lips twitched and a big rich, throaty laugh came from him. Something I wasn't expecting. It exposed something in him a minute, a kind of memoir to the man that at one time could've been feasible. I was only half disgusted. \"Truce,\" I chose to go against my better judgment. This conclusion had raced to me abruptly and mind you I was most likely at the moment could plead insanity. \"Just get me up okay.\" \"All right now.\" The blues of his eyes tightened, his pupils dilated and a heat leaked from his body. He struggled to come out of his perch. \"Didn't hurt you too much did I?\" I was at the moment busied giving myself the once over, checking the back of my head for blood. \"No I'm good.\" I lingered on the civility. \"Thank you for asking though… it's very human of you.\" \"For real? There I was thinking I was a jag-uhar or some shit.\" I laughed at that. Instantly I sobered as I assessed him. He really didn't look well and against better judgment I was very fast starting to become concerned. My hands brushed against his searing skin once again. He made a pathetic attempt to brush away my attempts. \"Hold up Darwin.\" My palms flitted against his forehead, \"You're burning up.\" Darwin brushed away my hand weakly and turned his face away; he was already succumbing to the fervor rushing through his blood. \"Ain't nothing whiskey can't fix.\" \"If you wanted to fry you should've had me leave you where you were at.\" Instantly I bit down on my lip and looked away. \"Sorry. I'm worried, is that fine by you? Can't I genuinely be concerned for your wellbeing? Wait just- don't answer that. Look it's nothing if I just run out real quick.\" \"What for?\" He was already up on his feet and walking into me. He dug his fingers deeply into the flesh of my arm. \"Look,\" I held my hands up to his faltering frame. \"It's only around the corner, five minutes tops. I need some ice for your bath. The longer you stay like this the less use either of us is gonna have. Please… just this once okay?\" * It wasn't quite as bad as I thought it was going to be. Of course there was the constant troublesome prickling at the back of my head telling me I was doing something wrong. My head felt constantly bloated as though there was a little person sitting atop my shoulders keeping my head afloat. I smiled at the Smithy's cashier behind the counter to the convenience store; we were now on a first name basis seeing that my visits were pretty much of a frequent thing. He inclined his head coolly and a smile stretched his easy features. He was simple and nice at that. About a week ago he had asked me on a date to which I mercilessly shot him down. He then offered me a lap dance as a kind of persuasion. I was quickly starting to prove to myself how much of an asexual being I was becoming, if that makes any kind of sense. It was that I was simply so familiar and accustomed to being alone there was no other way to quite function. I moved along the aisles as though I were indecisive. The ice box was in the far opposite corner and I went towards it with strong strides to grab as many bags of ice as I could possibly carry. Akeem raised an inquisitive eyebrow when he caught sight of my selection. \"Long night, crazy morning,\" I breathed normally. It was a tad bit early, almost 4:30 to be more precise. Akeem chuckled under his breath and swiftly rang me up. \"So what about an even crazier one later on?\" \"Aw, someone got there before you could. Sorry, but maybe some other time.\" I simply stated. He titled over the counter a bit to stare after me, \"I'm gonna get you girl!\" \"See you around Akeem. Stay off that stuff,\" I called over my shoulder. That went smoothly . I didn't waste any time getting home. I walked out into the soft rain and I drove exceptionally cautious, at the same time curbing the urge to get back too quickly. ** ","Summary":" A/N: This is a great attempt for me (way out of comfort zone) but I really appreciated the story.

I stood there silently, looking at him as he quivered under my gaze clearly afraid. Clearly underfed and clearly a victim of the unimaginable horrors of living in complete and utter panic. He looked like a beggar, or something close to one, a limp in his right leg causing him to lean to the other awkwardly. I was, very literally, death personified and looking at a potential prey. It was in my power to kill him, my right to kill him, but questions rose from my mouth instead. A curiosity building inside me. \"Why are you here? Who are you?\" It was clear German and this was Germany, the motherland, surely this man understood. \"What are you doing?\" More silence in my presence, maybe he didn't know what I was saying at all. Most Jews did, but the minority did not. Maybe he was part of that small number. \"Do you understand?\" A frightened little deer he was, his eyes followed my every move even though I did not make one, a sense of alarm in his eyes. \"I do\" Perfect, almost perfect, German was spoken back to me. His heritage got in the way of the true Aryan accent that most Polish had ,but this was expected of them. They were not true Germans. \"Then...what are you doing?\" He gulped uncertainly, probably thinking of possible escape routes. \"I...I was trying to open this can\" My eyes ventured to the offly large can on the floor, its contents still streaming into the cracks of the destroyed wood. He looked at it briefly in longing and disappointment, there was still more inside. \"Do you live here?\" He said nothing and I wondered where his small bit of courage went, he had enough to speak freely in front of a German officer that was perfectly capable of killing him and not being charged of any crime. He shook his head. \"No\" \"Your profession then?\" It took him time to answer, maybe to think of an elaborate lie to obtain his right to live in the face of danger. That's how they were depicted and viewed, liars and greedy money makers that like to steal, to cause others and the motherland pain. Who was I to test this known fact to the test? Who was I...to question our one and only ruler? He shivered, his breath coming out in a larger cloud than mine. I was warmer than him I observed, more clean shaven, more fortunate...and here we were on equal ground. \"I was a pianist\" he muttered lowly. I did not believe him momentarily, they were liars as the general had said. They would do anything to get out of a bad situation and I believed him in full, they lied all the time. What made this one so different? \"A pianist\" I mimicked his words. Trying to apply the profession as well as the adjective to the thing standing before me, it did not fit. I needed proof of what I could not see. I walked away from him, the slightest movements sending frightened expressions across his face. \"Show me\" I walked ahead of him expecting him to follow behind like a wounded animal, my word was law, any Aryan's word was law over the heads of those that endangered the country. He did not follow. I stopped and turned around when I did not hear the echoing steps behind me. \"Come on\" It was a command and he obeyed. He limped along past me as I held open the barely intact door for his entrance.[Chapter 2] Lament His hands shook violently as the tempo increased to an impressive speed, but calmed during the melodic parts. While listening to the chorus of the piece, my mind went back to a subordinate of mine that awaited my return in the cold. Either he waited patiently or impatiently I didn't know but what I did know was that my soldiers were loyal to me, and none of them had any idea at all that I was betraying everything they we were trained to know- what I was trained to know. I didn't notice when the Jewish man in front of me stopped playing, he stopped pounding his life into the ivory keys in front of him and it took me time to notice. He was telling the truth, I realized, he- a Jew did not lie to me. It would be foolish to still call him a liar after he had proved his worth to me, it was perhaps in their eyes- the normal reaction of an Aryan citizen or soldier. Perhaps the reason for that reaction was because of our love for the motherland, and our pride in it. After the fuhrer boosted our moral in our home, no one wanted to see it tarnished again, even though it may have been the truth. We needed something to blame- someone to blame, whatever it may be- no one honestly cared what it was. I realized the truth a long time ago. We were slowly but surely condemning these people to a life of solitude and then eventually to death. It wasn't hard to tell, but for them it was just a new set of rules. They didn't know what hit them, the signs had come slower for most of them that thought the best in the motherland as well. It was a decision for me then, side with my home and follow behind the new pride budding in the near future or, refuse to ostracize the very people who had already built a generation's worth of life here. It was obvious what decisions I made, but I still knew the truth and I recognized it every time I saw the fear I struck in the eyes of a Jew. In confidence, I could set this fact to blame for my actions. I knew the truth and I didn't turn a blind eye to it like most others did and because of this, my treacherous actions were not so treacherous- indeed they were not. But they were, in my heart- which always belonged to the motherland- my actions were despicable and spiteful towards my beloved. I even had full blooded Aryan family to show for my love of the motherland, a beautiful wife and just as beautiful children, where did my faith go? It most likely went to the man in front of me. The slimmer of hope in me that one day, this man or the shell of one, may find his place back where he was meant to be. As a musician, in front of thousands of his kind and thousands of others that weren't who were still fond of him, yet still politely envious all the same. I wished that for him, and knew for a fact that this would soon all end and he and his people would be free and I would be paying for the crimes that I have done for they were many. I was not predicting the future, I was seeing it. Seeing it bar me and some other group of fellows in with barbed wire and the skeletal beings that yelled profanities at us as we stayed silent- gawking at them with straight faces. My arm was slipped in a cast and there was a Jew that walked near, it compelled me to go up to him. \"Do you know of a musician, a Jewish one?\" This brought him closer to me, probably surprised that I, a German elite soldier, was even taking time to speak to him. \"There was a lot of Jewish musicians\" A glint of accusation lingered in his hallowed eyes and bleached skin surrounding them. I knew well what he meant by this and completely ignored it, I didn't have the luxury of time to go back and forth with this one. \"A popular one, a pianist\" His eyes widened in surprise, someone fitting the slim description most likely coming up in his mind. \"Szpilman...the one that played on the radio. What about him?\" \"Tell him to help me. I helped him when he needed it\" The Russian soldiers were coming, settling the standing German soldiers on the ground, a rise of panic came crawling up my stomach. Time was running out and the Jewish skeleton was giving me a quite contemplative look as he turned away, then turning back towards my direction and asking my name. A firm hand fell on my shoulder, harshly sitting me down in the mud and my hopes with it. \"Hosenfield. Wilhelm Hosenfeld\" A/N: that's the end of it :/ I feel like this chapter was a bit more juvenile than the last but it was only to effectively get my point across without using big words that weren't really necessary.

Even though I only saw snippets of it years ago, it stayed with me. This has been a one-shot in the making for a while but went through necessary changes and editing and I didn't get to finishing it until just recently. It uses a mixture of inspiration from the book and the movie and also Gavin Scott's original movie transcript. I hope you enjoy :) Disclaimer – I don't own anything – The Mists of Avalon belongs to Marion Zimmer Bradley, the movie to Gavin Scott and various other people. Scenario: Morgaine and a dying Arthur wait on the blink of oblivion to be accepted back into Avalon. Morgaine reminisces about her life and how it has somehow inexplicably and tragically been intertwined all along with her brother's. o0o Oh see, my brother, how the moon glides fair above the sea, And lights a silvered pathway there upon the rising wave. There must we follow you and I and at its ending be At last secure and safe within the sanctuary you crave. For we shall be at Avalon. (Nightflight) o0o I watch and wait in the pre-dawn chill like a person possessed. Floating, vulnerable on this sea of blackness. The great dark shroud of night threatens to overwhelm me, pull me under and the water is calm, unbearably calm and I hate it for being so. I can barely look at you, hearing instead your harsh, ragged intake of air, each laboured breath nearly stopping my heart. \" Sister...\" I reach down and touch your pale forehead gently, trembling from some unknown emotion. \"What is it dear one?\" \"You are sad.\" Your eyes open for a passing moment and I am caught up in the fierce, adoring devotion that I have always remembered since childhood that grew and matured as you did. Deep, unfathomable, profound. I turn away. \"The mists will not open for us little brother... the goddess will not allow it.\" And I am afraid because I cannot heal you... But I do not speak the fears that are on my mind. I must be strong for you. I feel your light touch on my arm, as faint and insubstantial as the passing wind. \"It matters not sister... I would have liked to see the fair Isle of Avalon, but I am content to float on this god-forsaken sea if you stay with me.\" Your words make me smile. \" Always , brother.\" But who knows where the wind will carry us… Perhaps, beyond Avalon itself... You are quiet for a moment. \"Morgaine...? When I pass through the veil, will I go the gods of my ancestors or to the Christian's god?\" I pick up your hand and kiss it fiercely, refusing to believe even now that I will lose you so soon. \"To whichever realm you choose Gwydion .\" Our souls are immortal, I'd always been told that, and so I believed. When we died, our bodies would be given back to the earth, as was the way of life, but the transcendent, living part of our being would rise like a silver osprey from the water, giving flight to the new dawn, whether to be re-born on the earth or fly to immortal realms, one could never be sure. You smile as if you remember something, maybe a memory, my playful use of your name has brought on. You look up at me with bright eyes, the sparkle still not quite faded. \"Do you remember the times we used to take the stable horses and escape from our lessons?\" I close my eyes and laugh silently. How could I forget...? \"Father Cuthbert was always so angry...\" You ramble on, glowing, made young by your boyish memories. I am caught off guard by your radiant face, and it is as if for a moment the pain is eased. I remember it well. We were young and impetuous then and so incredibly free. You laugh and your life-blood bubbles up and runs a path of coral-red red down your chin. \" Hush – Gwydion love – stop talking...\" I cover your mouth with my hand. You move your lips impatiently against my palm, your eyes fevered. \"You once told me that all things happen according to the will of the gods. Is this what they have willed Morgaine? For Britain to fall into enemy hands?\" You speak quietly, but I can sense your anguish. \"Did they foresee this ? Or have our lives all been lived for nothing...?\" \"Not for nothing love. Never for nothing…\" But I interlace your fingers with mine, the past, a misty fog before my eyes. All lives are ordained... I had been told, and all things pass into the mists of time... But to what extent? For I remember everything… As a child, I would kneel by your bed-side. Night time at Camelot was magical. The shadows lingered, throwing gloomy shapes against the walls. And most often than not, you couldn't sleep and so would beg me with all the audaciousness of your five years to tell you stories. \" But Morgaine you promised!\" And so I knelt and proceeded to invoke the magic of storytelling during witching hour. The sea crashed against our high walls and candlelight flickered in the gloom. Your eyes shone blue-black in the darkness; our whispered secrets gave way to giggles. The candlelight became a fire, the bed-sheets; the open sea. I'd demonstrate the killing blow as the knight crushed the serpent. One hand stretched to poise, and the other ready to crumple up the blankets in a tumultuous heap of feathers and rough linen. There was no talk of destiny then, only light and warmth and dear familiarity. \"When I'm older Morgaine, will I live forever?\" \"No one lives forever silly.\" \"But what about the stars...They live forever don't they?\" \"I don't know Gwydion.\" \"Then I will be a star Morgaine and I will never die! I will shine brightly so that you will know where I am and we will be together always...\" Always. But destiny had its say eventually. The spring held long shadows in the grass. Mother's tear-filled eyes, Father watching on as the Merlin pulled you from my arms, Viviane watching with trepidation. \" Don't leave me Morgaine.\" And your eyes became an ocean. And it was in that moment, that I realised I would lose you... perhaps forever. But instead we locked eyes and fates and hands and promised we'd come back for each other. I'll never leave your side. And so I was initiated into the sacred heart of the Mother goddess, learning to still my mind, to become one with nature, to master the elements. It was there I met and fell in love with my Aunt's son, Lancelot on the rocky steps of the Tor, who in turn fell captivated to the vision of a girl through the mists in Glastonbury, a girl that would ultimately be his undoing. I dreamt of war and suffering and destiny and promise... and you, you most of all. But we were destined to meet, oh yes, played by the forces around us, in a way we would never have wished upon ourselves. On that one fateful night... when I was but a trembling virgin, a priestess, taking on the guise of the Mother goddess, my body painted with the symbols of the earth. That night I would meet the chosen one, the Horned god, the one who would unite the Old religion and the new one in a ritual as old as time itself. Beltane, red earth, red heat and a song... a vibration, a hum. Faint at first and then louder and louder until it became a resounding beat, strong, echoing the beat of my heart. A man stood against the red heat of the firelight, antlers illuminated by the dancing flames, who was young and strong and full of life, virile and passionate, whose arms and lips were fire and where we met and merged, the heavens trembled... But in the morning, when sticky eye-lids greeted the early morning sun, we were merely human; a man and a woman in each other's arms. It was then that you looked at me in recognition, remembered my voice. \" Oh gods ... my brother... Gwydion?\" Gwydion . The child-hood name – meaning bright one – named so for your bright hair. \" Arthur,\" You had whispered. I had a vivid memory of my mother's sad, tired-worn face, her lips moving: \"This is your little brother and you must love and care for him...\" Surely it couldn't have been you... not my baby brother... No – not this strange, beautiful man who lay all night with me, who touched me and held me in ways I'd never known and in doing so, pierced my heart. And in that twilight chamber beneath the earth, we wept together in terrible grief as I held you like I used to do all those years ago, overwhelmed at the forces which strove to determine our destinies and play us like pawns. For that is what we became brother... little pieces on a game-board that would be used for the good of Avalon and the saving of the world. Even as King, you were golden, victorious, every hope and every dream made manifest. You were everything that the people needed and yet you suffered and I suffered with you. \"Morgaine I -\" And your eyes had been pleading, anguished, bright, on that wind-swept hillside. \"Arthur – I know what it is you want to say but -\" \"By the gods , Morgaine – I promised I would always love you and -\" \"No!\" And I was harsh, uncompromising . \"You must put this madness behind you brother.\" For that is sometimes the way you must show love. By being harsh, strong, unyielding. I had run away from that place in tears, for I had discovered that I was with child. Your child. I turned on Viviane in fury. \"What else must I give Aunt ? First my mother, then my father who died because of you, and now my poor brother Arthur, who was a baby in my arms, who loved me more than anything in the world... And I loved him... You've torn him apart; you've taken our pure, innocent love and turned it into shame!\" She had looked at me with that hard, unflinching stare, that I used to think were the eyes of the Mother goddess herself. \"I would give anything – my very soul for the good of Avalon!\" And in her eyes I saw my fate and I renounced it. I renounced it all. Never, Never again would I set foot there. But my life it seems was destined for sadness dear brother. All those I really loved, I could never have... poor Lancelot who it seemed I had wanted forever… Accolon... How you would have pitied me brother. But you had your own bout of sadness to deal with. Your Queen was childless while I bore a son. Dark and beautiful and Fay-like, but with eyes teeming with millions of squirming things. I wonder what went through your mind when you saw him for the first time? When you realised he was your son...? Did you see me in him? Did you see yourself...? Did you ever think that you would be each other's undoing in the end? He turned you into a frail, ghost of a person, your hair matted and falling into your eyes. You had looked at me that day in the empty throne-room with eyes so devoid of hope. \"You have come back...\" your haunted eyes had said. \"Arthur, you must make ready, the Saxons are almost upon us...\" You had looked at me with dull, glazed eyes. \"I am but a sinner who slept with his own sister, who loves his sister like no other, whose son is running rampant through Camelot turning the religion of the mother goddess into a whorehouse...\" \"Arthur! We are all sinners, but does that mean we must cower and beg forgiveness for the rest of our days? Or are we going to stand and fight and continue fighting until our dying breath? Your people need you !\" \"I am unfit to lead the people.\" \"You can do this and you must . You are the chosen one. Now stand!\" And I had put Excalibur into your trembling hands and urged you to fight. One last time. And now here we were… the outcome of a bloody battle, the remnants of a lost glory… Mist and coolness and the chill of dawn bring me back to the present. I turn to you, realising for the first time, how weary you look, how time has changed us. Irrevocably. Completely. \"I am sorry sister...\" you whisper. \"I wish...\" you struggle as if trying to convey some incomprehensible emotion. \"I wish things were -\" \" Hush .\" I put a finger over your lips, a burning in my throat. I do not wish for things to be different for it cannot change my love for you. I look down at your dear face and ache from a cut too deep to fathom. You solemnly touch the strands of my long beaded hair like a child. I lean down and kiss your forehead. Cold. If I could give you the world, I would. But I can't ... I can't give you everything dear brother. The goddess only knows I wish I could. But some things are not meant to be... Sometimes dreams of shining like stars only belong to stories, To legend... Some things you have to let go of, brother. And you cannot know how hard that is. I have fought to protect you my whole life. For we are like two children on a black sea, on the edge of oblivion, locked out of Paradise. The goddess had abandoned us, yes – but we had abandoned her. \"Perhaps...\" you whisper quietly, as if reading my thoughts. \"Perhaps we need to give something ... in return...\" And you motion weakly to the blade at your side. I look at you curiously for a moment and take the shining blade in my hands. How many hopes and dreams had been caught up in this precious object? And with a determined will and strong arm, I stand and spin Excalibur straight out into the misty blue. For a moment, it seems to dissipate like light on water and disappears in the form of a cross. The earth holds its breath and flutters in ripples and waves. Then right before us the heavens sigh and open up, spilling forth like a raiment of stars and an unveiling of cloud, and through the clearing mist a beautiful, undying land spreads vast and green before us. I can hardly believe my eyes. We've been accepted after all. I let out a long drawn-out breath. Avalon. I feel my heart clench within me. It fills me with hope and inexplicable joy. I wrap my arms around you and lift you so that you can see it. \" Look... Arthur... We're home.\" And I sit you up against me like a child and in my mind we are children again, laughing and playing against a sun-lit landscape. But you do not answer. \"My little brother... my love ...\" \" We're home.\" But you have slipped quietly away, your soul flying light and care-free into the clear dawn. I hold your body in my arms and cry my heart out, marvelling at the irony of it all... that you have gone to join your forefathers in realms unknown and have left me behind. The sun appears and rests calmly on the water and for a moment it is as if you are bathed with red and gold fire; a blessing of sacred proportions. I lean down and lightly kiss your mouth; blood on my lips. Crimson, like the sky-line. \"Sleep brother...\" I whisper. \"And be at peace.\" For it is in your legacy, your memory that you will live on. You had once told me that you would be a star and would shine brightly so that others would find you, so that I would find you… I hold you close to me fiercely. Yes brother, we will laugh and wade through the cool, green shadows of Avalon forever. We will ride our horses through wheat-fields and oceans and constellations. We shall scatter the stars. o0o Note: The poem at the beginning is the first stanza of a beautiful poem cited from a website, titled 'Glastonbury - Camelot Revisited' Gavin Scott's first original script for the movie adaptation The Mists of Avalon (which in parts is quite different to what they ended up with) is from a website 'The Two Evil Monks.'

The nights were getting longer and the days were getting darker. The air was thick with anticipation and foreboding. He could feel it course over his skin just as he could feel the wind toy with his hair. Darkness was coming and all he could think of was her. Arthur closed his eyes, his hands fisting, scrapping against the rough stones. The pain on his hands was nothing compared to the anguish in his heart, but it drew some of his attention from her eyes. Those eyes that had always watched him with joy and caring and love when they were children. Mischief danced in those eyes still, the same mischief that had manifested in escapades away from the priests had grown and matured with her body. How could he not have known? It had been her eyes that had captivated him during his role in the rite of Beltane. Eyes that had haunted him even more than her body and hands had, and that was saying something. He shuddered at that thought. It had been her that he had loved every night since. When he came to Guinevere, it was her image that his hands touched, her lips that he kissed, and her eyes that he held. It was her he still loved. \"Morgaine…\" Her name left his lips and whispered on the air, hanging there around him. Suffocating him with it sweet sound. It felt so right on his lips, left so easily from his tongue. His voice had never sounded as sure as when he spoke that name. He looked to his right, down into the courtyard, down into the eyes of his son. Mordread was always watching him, but his eyes were not his mother's and he could not see any of himself in them. Oh, there were hints and lingering traces of him in Mordread. What he had taken as proof of Morgaine's parentage, the physical that so resembled himself, he had shrugged off as the common parentage he shared with Morgaine. It was parentage that they shared, but it was a different kind. He was the father. Arthur looked away from his son and back out over the placid waves, his vision blurring the edge of the sea with the sky until he knew not where one began and the other ended. Mordread was never the one who broke eye contact. He maintained it, his eyes hard and predatory. So unlike Morgaine's. In all other aspects, Mordread was Morgaine's son. His form was light and small, but well toned and deceptively delicate. Mordread was expert at the sword and physical combat, and his smaller frame gave him the advantage of speed. Their faces were similar, faerie shaped and wicked, but Morgaine's was pleasant to look upon where Mordread's was harsh. He knew Mordread thought that his easy loss of eye contact spoke of his weakness and fear, and perhaps it was weakness that made him look away from a face that took everything that he loved of Morgaine's and twisted it into a perversion. Mordread was the perversion of their love and he hated him for that just as he loved him for being a bond between himself and his sister. He could regret Mordread, but not the conception nor the love that had been created through the act. Guinevere had given up his bed and company outside of public view. He couldn't blame her. She had in her mind been betrayed by the man she had sworn herself to, the man she had sought so hard to give a son to. He had never been fooled that she loved him, but she had been fooled at his own devotions. He knew she was enjoying the pleasure of Lancelot's bed and welcomed that knowledge, hoping that in his arms she found what he had found in the arm of Morgaine. He was selfish in this want, selfish to be pleased with her removal from him because without the necessity to take her to bed he could no longer betray her, no longer imagine Morgaine when he held Guinevere. And because he was selfish he closed his eyes and let the face that haunted him form behind his eyelids. Let the details form in all their perfect torment. Her eyes first, then her lips and face, her hair that seemed to flow like water through his fingers. Then her body, forming in shapes and lights and colors until each completed and joined, forming the perfection that was his love. When it had been simply the Huntress he had loved, her face had been covered, but now that he knew it was Morgaine's., now that he knew the identity of his love he welcomingly brought her face forward with as much pleasure as there was pain in the knowing and accepting. He knew and accepted his love. It had always been her he had loved most… Would always be her. First as an adoring brother to a confident older sister, second as a mystery woman whose touch had awakened in him something that no other had, and third as the lover he had always sought and the mother of his child. In his life, only she had held so much of him… she had touched him like no other. But what did she feel? She must know the truth behind Mordread's birth. He was sure that she had not known during the Rite, it was forbidden for either to know who they took to them that night and as a Priestess she would honor that condition. It had been he who had told her, unknowingly of course, blind to his own sister's reaction as he had lost himself in the description of his dream lover. He had been too focused on the phantom eyes in his mind to notice those same eyes only inches from his own, wide in comprehension and denial as he continued on. He hadn't seen the pain dawn on her face. It hadn't registered, but now it did and it tore at him that he had been so blind to her distress. She knew then, and had not told him. Ever the protector of her brother, she had harbored the truth from him, keeping the knowledge to herself. It must have tormented her. He knew it had and he couldn't help the pain that told him she had rejected the idea of it being his child. Of course she had. Who would dream of begetting a child with her own brother? The idea had at first had left him dumbfounded, but he had come to terms with it and could only hope that she had as well. He had no grand delusions that she loved him as he loved her, no hope that she had thought of him as he thought of her every night in his life. He could hope, but hope held little strength in this world that was quickly falling in around him. The light and joy he had hoped to bring to this world was fading in the darkness that was closing in around Camelot, like the night had closed in around him, but unlike the night, the darkness would not be broken by the warm brilliance of the sun once it had run its course. This Darkness held no course, it ran on at will and lasted for as long as it could beat down those who would seek to destroy it. It caused pain and hate. It killed and pillaged, not caring who it touched… it was indiscriminate of gender, race, age, and religion. It burned and its fire would be the only light that shone on the world. He would be destroyed. Those he loved would be destroyed and everything he had worked for would fade. Avalon would disappear because he was too weak to fight. He ran his hands back of the stones beneath his palm. No, he wasn't too weak. That was the wrong phrasing. Looking back out across the sea he felt the emptiness grow within him and admitted to himself why he refused to pick up Excalibur and fight against what was coming. He just didn't care anymore… couldn't… He turned from the sea and let himself sink down, against the stones that he had had raised, to the floor that so many of those who had followed him had tread. They had followed because he had led, they had stayed because he held Excalibur before them and offered a world of peace that they had only dreamed of and he had done it with the backing of both the God and the Goddess. It was an answered prayer that they could not turn away from. He had betrayed them and let them believe… He had needed to believe as well. To believe that he had a part in the world, that he was needed… Didn't everyone feel that way? He just happened to be the one that had been offered the chance to be something greater than most would ever be and like a fool he had grasped it, falling into the weave of fate and the plans of others beyond his comprehension. He let his head fall forward as he pulled his knees up and wrapped his arms around them. It would be so easy to leave, to let the Darkness consume Camelot and be far from it when the pain began, but he couldn't. He wasn't so pathetic as to leave what he had built, what he had believed in. He might give in, give up on the fight but he would never leave. Morgaine wouldn't understand… And there it was, the main reason he wouldn't leave: Morgaine. Everything circled back around to her. Everything always had and in the final end that was coming, it would circle once again to her. All he had to do was stay… It sounded so easy. It was so small and simple a word, but left him shaking every time he thought of it. Staying meant facing Guinevere and Lancelot, staying meant lying to his men as he pretended to lead them as he had once done, as he could no longer do. He didn't have the will to do more than that, but staying meant Morgaine and Morgaine meant Everything. If he could hold on till she returned. He lifted his head and looked to the stars with a desperate look of hope. She would return. To Camelot. To him… Morgaine would not run, she was strong where he was not. She had strength that he could only imagine and a will as free and tough as a woman who had faced what she had would have to own in order to survive. She had survived and would survive this Darkness, but he wouldn't. He knew it, felt it in his heart, but what he held onto was the desire to leave this world in her presence. He would die the man she believed him to be. And so he would lie, and betray, and face the stares and whispers. He pushed up from the ground, back erect as he turned back to the sea And so… he would stay. If only to see her face… her eyes… once more. If only to die with her knowing him as both of them had wanted him to be: Strong… ","Summary":" The castle stone was cool and strong beneath his hands, rough and comforting as he looked out over "},{"Movie":"Mists of Avalon","Title":"Lost in the Darkness","Author":"Crystal7","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2438945","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Lost in the Darkness Synopsis: Morgaine'snpain and sorrow after discovering the truth about the night of thenBeltane rituals (TV based) With child.

You purposely went out your way to make me miserable.\" \"You have done the same to me. Perhaps it was just your comeuppance.\" \"Think Gwenhwyfar. I have given birth to a son and raised another, whonloved me deeply. I have had two sons. Elaine has had a son and twondaughters, you have had no children. Is this how your God rewards hisnfollowers? If he does not reward sinners than you must be a great sinnernand the rest of us saintly.\" \"You've used devil worships to get what you want!\" \"No,\" Morgaine whispered, \"It is your own fault you are barren Gwenhwyfar.nI gave you a charm to help you conceive, because I thought that that wasnwhat you most wanted. But it was not. That is how Lancelet wound up innyour bed! You wanted him most of all!\" \"Listen to you,\" Gwenhwyfar said, trying to stay calm, \"You the harlot.\" Morgaine smacked her sister-in-law again, \"Harlot. Hardly. I may have hadnmany lovers but never was I married!\" \"You were married to Uriens when you had your affair with Accolon.\" \"True,\" Morgaine said. \"Well Gwenhwyfar, I guess you got what you wantednafter all. You get to be a nun in Glastonbury.\" \"Truly,\" Gwenhwyfar said, \"I love Arthur, you must believe that. I lovednhim as a king and a man, but I loved Lancelet with passion. Please, gonnow, Arthur needs you. Mordred is raising all sorts of problem for Arthur.n Please help him. I cannot stand to think Arthur as fallen.\" \"He is fallen,\" Morgaine whispered in pain. She turned to Gwenhwyfar, \"Andnyou are the cause of his downfall. Because of your bedding with Lanceletnand the carelessness with which you were caught Arthur will fall andnBritain as we know will go with him.\" She gathered up her skirts and leftnGwenhwyfar standing in her wake. She would take care of Mordred. As fornGwenhwyfar, she would spend her life in penitence and rot in her ownndevilish hell.

Ah, como erabom ser livre, poder respirar o ar puro da manhã, no mais profundo contato com seu ser! Rindo e girando, sentia o corpo leve e parecia que podia cair a qualquer momento, mas era uma sensação boa, era como se fosse um pássaro, querendo voar pela eternidade! E ela ria. Não sabia por que, apenas estava feliz por estar ali. Os pés descalços pisavam no chão úmido e repleto das folhas, e novas flores nasciam, indicando que a primavera estava por vir. -Guinevere! – ouviu uma voz distante gritar – Guinevere, onde você esta! Mas nao deu ouvidos. Era maravilho poder estar ali, no coração de Avalon, absorta em seus próprios pensamentos, sem ninguem a sua volta. Sabia que devia ouvir e respeitar as sacerdotisas, e que alguem que queria se tornar uma devia ter este respeito com as mais velhas, e tenta aprender ao maximo. Mas de que lhe valia ficar na cozinha, fazendo pães e bolos enquanto podia estar na floresta, em um contato com a Deusa, sua verdadeira mãe. Não havia ninguem que podia discutir isso com ela. Sempre fora assim, convicta do que queria, e dificilmente aceitava receber ordens. Era a filha da Deusa e nascera livre para andar pelo mundo e perpetuar aquilo que um dia Ela havia começado. Mas, finalmente, algo lhe chamou a atenção: -Guinevere! Ele esta aqui! – a voz da mulher novamente gritou, e Guivere parou de subito, esperando ouvir aquilo que espera que a mulher falasse – É Galahad! Ele chegou! Abrindo um enorme sorriso, sem hesitar correu moro abaixo, passando por entre as árvores até chegar no pé do morro, correu por um corredor, passando por entre algumas sacerdotisas que carregavam cestas de pão, e desceu uma escada lateral de pedras, sem parar de correr, chegando ao pé da colina de Avalon, na beira do lago. Podia avistar as brumas a uma certa distancia, agora novamente fechadas. O visitante ja havia chegado. -Primo! – pulou de subito no pescoço do garoto que estava parado com um largo sorriso no rosto. Ele não era muito mais alto que ela, e seus cabelos pretos contrastavem com seus loiros quase brancos. Tinha um ar jovial, os olhos azuis como o céu daquela manhã e uma certa carisma e confiança estanpada no rosto. Largando-o por um momento, ainda segurando seus ombros, Guinevere admirou o primo. Estava tao formoso naquelas vestes de cavaleiro, vestido de vermelho e dourado, e cheirava tão bem... Certamente era o garoto mais bonito que ja vira. E pensando nisso, sentiu o coração pular uma batida, e ficou um pouco mais leve nos braços daquele que agora era homem. Mas sacudiu a cabeça, afastando tais pensamentos, afinal, era seu primo, e sempre seria aquele com quem brincara muito durante anos. -Mas o que houve com você? Esta tão mais alto, e mais forte! Vejo que a corte de Pendragon esta fazendo bem a você. – dizia enquanto circulava Galahad, inspecinando-o. -E vejo que você nada mudou,prima. Imaginei chegar aqui e encontrar uma solene e séria sacerdotisa, e vejo só! Continuo a olhar para aquela que colocava lagartos nos meus sapatos! – brincou -E irá dizer que não esta aliviado, meu senhor? – ironizou Guinevere, dando os ombros e um meio sorriso. Houve uma pausa, na qual Galahad olhou para os lados para se certificar de que ninguem ouvia e depois abaixou, chegando proximo á prima, sussurando. -Não podia estar mais feliz. – e sorriu grasiosamente. Guinevere deu um pulinho de excitação, e deu um rápido abraço novamente no primo. -É bom ter você aqui. – ela disse, passando a mão em seu rosto, com um leve sorriso. Ele fechou os olhos e sorriu, pegando a mão que escostava-lhe no rosto. -É muito bom voltar. Após um curto espaço de tempo ambos riram, e Guinevere pegou o recem chegado pelas mãos, conduzindo-o morro acima pelas escadas pelas quais descera, mas ao chegar ao meio da escada, Galahad a puxou para olhar para trás. -Olha ali, logo á frente. Lembra-se se quando minha mãe nos levou para os montes, onde colhemos milhos e batatas? – suspirou o menino, já nao tao menino, olhando alem das brumas e do lago, para os verdes montes á uma distancia incalculavel. -Lembro – disse guinevere rindo-se – Você quis mostrar que era melhor e tentou carregar umas trinta batatas de uma só vez. Nunca vou me esquecer de você rolando com todas elas morro a baixo! – e riu – E entao você chorou, e Arthur foi até você e disse: Não chores primo. Agora você sabe que ao menos sabe dar cambalhota. -Ele gostou daquele momento. – brincou -Não... – Guinevere agora olhava os montes, pensativa – Arthur nunca foi vingativo. Ele gostava de ajudar. Só nao sabia como. – e deu um leve sorriso triste, ainda com os olhos no horizonte. -Você sente falta dele, nao é Gui? -E como não poderia. Arthur era como um irmão para mim, nunca lhe desejaria mal. Não posso dizer o mesmo de Morgana, afinal de contas, ela me assusta um pouco. – e ambos riram – Estou brincando. Do mesmo modo, é uma pena que meu querido Arthur nao possa vir e estar presente para as fogueiras de Beltane; ele irá perder o grande momento. -Grande momento... Quer dizer que este ano será... -Sim! – disse radiante – Minha iniciação! Finalmente a Mãe acha que estou pronta. -Mas apenas acha. Com você nada é muito sólido. Ás vezes sinto que não te conheço. -Sou constante como o vente meu querido primo. – e sorriu novamente. Ela nunca deixa de sorrir... E esta mais radiante que nunca. Ah, que falta que me fez! Não podia estar mais bela... Pensou Galahad, admirando a menina a sua frente. -Vamos meu querido. Sua mãe deve estar ansiosa para ve-lo, assim como dua prima Morgana e todos os outros. Não houve outro assunto por aqui que nao fosse os dois triunfantes cavaleiros Galahad e Arthur! E tambem quero ouvir mais historias da corte, e saber como vai meu Arthur, que a tanto nao tenho niticias... Vamos.

Inhad heard the stories, Hernlegend served her well \"Innthe council,\" he said shortly. She smiled at him—he was obviouslynscared at the thought of his first battle. She had seen many battles,nthough, and she was not at all frightened. In fact, she showed nonemotion at all, but continued on her way to the main hall of thencastle Camelot. She would be the one to give the report to the King,nher mother, and the Knights of the Round Table. Anmystic's myth or fable, Truthnor fairy tale Thengirl stepped onto the cold stone of the courtyard, walking quicklynover it to get to the main hall. She passed many people, but she didnnot speak to them.

He wasndisheveled, not like her. But then, he had come from Wales, while shenhad been in Camelot for weeks. The girl shook off all thoughts butnthose of the report she would be giving in a few moments. Shensaid, \"Sit with \" Menmy daring,\" Shenwalked into the hall, Accolon walking off to the stables to ready thenhorses for battle. She shook her head, and rapped on the door thrice.nThen she walked in, and tossed a velum scroll on the round table innthe room's center. \"Gentlemen,\" she said, \"and mother. Thisnis the latest news we have. The Saxons are by now past Cornwall andnare advancing on us at full speed. We must ready for war now, or allnis lost.\" \" Let'sntalk a Littlenwhile,\" \"Now,nMaur-Maur, isn't that a bit drastic?\" asked Lancelot, from hisnplace next to Arthur and his mother, Viviane, the only woman in thenroom.

Andnthe road goes on Seemingnever longer Onnthe way to Mandalay \"No,nLancelot, it isn't,\" she snapped. \"The Saxons will be here in anmatter of hours, and if we stay this unprepared they will take thisncastle and all of Britannia with it!

It is up to the King whether or not to follownher advice, but do not shun it. It is the greatest asset you have.\" Thenmile went on forever, Thenminutes turned to days Mauranturned and walked away, into the main part of the castle. She wasnlooking for her cousins Morgaine and Guinevere. She needed them tonbegin making remedies fort he troops. She knew that the Saxons wouldnstart a siege of Camelot, and it could go on for weeks, perhaps evennmonths. She was dearly glad that hr mother had insisted that shenbring the healing herbs, just in case the Saxons managed to attacknwhile they were in Camelot. CouldnI have been misguided Bynthe mystic's ways? Mauranshook her head, and climbed the stairs. She strode to Morgaine'snroom, knocked thrice, and opened the door. The bare-looking room wasnempty but for a bed and a table and two chairs. The girl sighed—shenreally did not want to go into Guinevere's room, with all itsnpictures of saints and crosses and her Christian god. Maura wasnreally not comfortable there. Thenmoment lasts forever, Atnleast it does for me Shensighed, and began to walk to Guinevere's chambers, shuddering atnthe thought of facing the image of someone crucified. Maura had nevernreally gotten the reason for hanging up images of a dead body onnwalls and such, even though Viviane had explained it to her numerousntimes. She tired to shake off the uneasiness she felt, and onlynsucceeded in doing so by reminding herself that Morgaine would benthere as well. Caughtnbetween what happened Andnwhat could never be Mauranknocked on Guinevere's door once, instead of thrice, for knockingnon a door thrice was a symbol of trust, and she did not trustnGuinevere. The door opened promptly, and she was confronted by anservant of Guinevere's. \"I need to speak with my cousinsnGuinevere and Morgaine,\" she said. \"It is urgent, I am afraid, sonyou must make haste, and I do not care if the Queen does not wish tonsee me. I am here on the orders of the High King.\" Andnthe road goes on Seemingnever longer Onnthe way to Mandalay Thenservant nodded, and let Maura in.

The girl walked back down the steps, andnstarted towards the stables, to check on the Calvary. She saw, to hernsurprise, Lancelot heading the rest of the knights as they readiedntheir horses. They were all ready for battle, and Lancelot smiled atnher. \"I'm sorry, Maura,\" he said. Andnthe road goes on Forevernwill I wander Onnthe way to Mandalay Shensmiled at him, and walked back into the stables, leading her whitenhorse, SunSar, out and saddling her.

At the same time, we both turned the corner and collided into eachrnother, dropping our books. \"I'm sornsorry,\" she apologized quickly as she stooped for her book.

Crimson slowly moved toward the sword, as she readied to grab it annoise makes her stop. Hearing the sound of closing footsteps she duckednback into the shadows. The footsteps came to an abrupt halt in front of hernhiding place. She shifted her position slightly to get a better look atntheir faces. She gasped realizing that the black armored soldiers were notnfrom the village. Hearing a noise one of the men turned to look in Crimson's direction,nseeing nothing but darkness he moved closer. As he advanced her breathncaught and her heart began to pound wildly. Just go away, please just gonaway. She closed her eyes tightly hopping that when she opened them the mannwould be gone. Crimson opened her eyes to find herself laying face down on thenground in the middle of the village square. She slowly sat up and lookednaround, to her right two of the soldiers had a hold of Julian and Jade, tonher left stood a large man with a black skull shaped mask. He watched her a moment before he speaks. \"These friends of yours?\"nHe asked indicating the two younger children. Crimson glared at him. \"What's it to you?\" She replied slowly raisingnto her feet. \"Defiance will not be tolerated young one.\" He motioned to thensolider holding Jade, the solider pulled a dagger and holded it to Jade'snthroat. \"Shall we continue, if you answer my next question truthfully yournlittle friend here will live to see her next brithday.\" Crimson growled lightly. \"What do you want to know?\" \"Now, now, no reason to be hostle.\" He chuckled. \"Where can I findnthe one called Damen Starfire?\" She shruged. \"No clue, he comes and goes as he wishes.\" \"Why do you lie?\" He motioned to the soldier and he pulled the daggernacross Jade's throat killing her inistantly, he released his hold on hernand her lifeless body fell to the ground. Crimson moved toward the soldier who was smiling triumpfintly. \"Damnnyou.\" Another soldier brought his sword up pointing it in her face. \"Onnyour knees.\" Crimson did as she was told. \"Shall we try this again?\" A tall slender figure wearing a black cloak steped through the crowdnof soldiers. He removed his hood. \"Dlaxius, I am the one you seek. Let thenchildren go.\" \"Hm, Damen.\" Dlaxius replied. He noded and the soldier let go ofnJulian and he ran over to Crimson. Damen looked at Crimson. \"Run.\" Crimson shook her head raping her arms around Julian. \"I will notnleave you father.\" Dlaxius looked slightly puzzled. \"Father? Hmm, intresting.\" Henchuckled. \"Get them.\" He drew his sword and charged at Damen. Damen blocked several blows and turned aming a blow at Dlaxius' head,nonly to have Dlaxius sink his blade into his chest. Damen fell to hisnknees. Dlaxius placed his foot against Damen's chest and pushed backnpulling the sword from his chest. Damen fell back stuggling to breathe. Two soldiers walked toward them carring a struggling Crimson and annunconscious Julian. \"Take them away. No wait.\" He thought a moment. \"Leave her.\" Crimson moved to Damen's side. She looked up at Dlaxius. \"Why did youndo this to my father?\" Dlaxius chuckled. \"He isn't your father young one, he is a kidnaper,na thief and a liar.\" He placed a hand on her shoulder. \"I am your fathernCrimson.\" She looked down at Damen's now lifeless body. \"It's not true Damennis my father.\" He turned away from her. \"Believe what you wish child, but you cannnot deny the truth.\" Crimson sighed. He speaks as if he is trying to convence himself morenthen he is me. He thought a moment. Turning he grabed her right arm he pulled up hernsleeve exposing a small skull shaped tattoo with the name Crimson Rainbladenwritten underneath it. \"This mark has made you an outcast here has it not?\" Crimson noded sadly. \"This is a royal brith mark given only to those born a mist the wallnof the Firestar academy.\" He squeezed her arm. \"It only proves that you donnot belong here, you belong with me.\" He let go of her. \"Come with me andnyou may have whatever you wish.\" Having no where else to go , nor the skills or strength to protectnherself, if she were to run away. Crimson accepted Dlaxius' offer. Dlaxius mounted his horse pulling her up behind him. The group rodenoff into the darking night. Taking Crimson along for the ride.[Chapter 2] A Simple Twist Of Fate (chapter 2) Come morning the group of about thirty soldiers had reached the smallnvillage of Nova Linda. Crimson looked about the small sleepy village. She smiled. Hownpeaceful. Out of the corner of her eye she saw five of the soldiers carringntorches had started fires around some of the buildings. Dlaxius rode through the village as if nothing were happening. Thenrest of the soldiers started pulling people from their homes and killingnthem. Suddenly a boy about the same age as Crimson appeared in front ofnthem. Dlaxius rode toward him. The boy didn't move. What's wrong with him why does he not move, it is as if he does notnsee us. Crimson thought. She closed her eyes waiting to hear the sound ofncrushing bones as the horse moved faster. But all she heard was a suddennscream and then a hard thud. She opened her eyes and looked back to see thenboy laying on the ground. \"My goodness what did you do to him?\" She jumpednoff the horse and ran to him. Dlaxius turned the horse moving back toward them. \"Killed him mostnlikely.\" She glared at him. \"He's not dead and I will not allow you to killnhim.\" Dlaxius chuckled. \"If we let him live he will surely tell someonenwhat has happened here.\" Crimson stood. \"Listen father.\" It pained her to call him that,nbecause the man she saw before her was nothing more then a tyrant. \"If younkill him you will have to kill me as well.\" Dlaxius noded. He had just found his only child and he didn't want tonlose her again. Especially over the life of a now orphaned village boy \"Asnyou wish, we will take him with us.\" He motioned to a soldier who liftednthe boy up and layed him on his stomach over the back of a horse. Crimson smiled. Seems as though I can make him do whatever I want. A soldier walked up beside her and bowed slightly. \"Your horsenm'lady.\" She took the reins and he helped her up on to the horse. The group rode from the village leaving a mass of burning rubble. Thenlong ride to the academy was filled with an awkward silence. Crimson thought a moment before she spoke. \"I suppose you've informednthese monkeys that the boy is not to be harmed?\" She looked at Dlaxius.nLooking for perhaps a small sign that he had at least some emotion. Dlaxius noded. \"What am I to do with him if he is not to be killed?\"nHe looked at her his eyes shining slightly. \"This academy of yours trains soldiers does it not?\" He noded shifting his gaze back to the road. \"You could train him as one.\" She continued to watch him. \"I will do for him what I can.\" Crimson smileed. Well it's a start, at least he's not going to killnhim. As they reached the academy a set of big metal doors openednwelcoming them. Crimson sighed having a renewed sense of hope for the newnlife she had yet to live. As they enter the academy, A boy looking to benabout ten years old hurried over to them. \"Welcome back master, I take itnyour journey went well?\" Dlaxius noded as he climbed down off his horse. He walked back andnhelped Crimson down from her horse. Once on the ground Crimson looked around, her gaze finally settled onnthe boy who referred to Dlaxius as master. When the boy turned to look atnher she turned away blushing slightly and walked off. The boy looked at Dlaxius slightly confused. \"Who is she master?\" Henasked indicating Crimson. Dlaxius placed a hand on the boy's shoulder. \"It's not important, ButnI am sure you will learn in time.\" Crimson wondered the academy halls. Wondering why and what madenDaemon want to take her from this place, from her father. She wantednanswers but wasn't quite sure how to get them. Reaching the end of onenhall she turned down another rounding the corner she ran into someone, Shenstumbled backward. She looked up into the face of the boy she saw in thencourtyard when she came in. \"Excuse me.\" She blushed a bit and keptnwalking. He smiled slightly. \"No problem.\" He watched her. \"Wait a secondnwhat's your name?\" \"I-I'm not supposed to talk to you.\" She turned to look at him again.n\"I-I'm sorry.\" She ran off headed to her room. Reaching her room she entered and quickly shut the door. She layedndown on the bed and stared at the ceiling thinking about the boy. He'sncute, but why do I get this weird feeling when I see him? . She rolled onnto her side. I want to tell him my name but I can't. She sighed closing herneyes. Wonder if I'll ever see him again? With that question weighingnheavily on her mind she fell into a dreamless sleep. What her future had innstore for her she did not yet know but she planed to make it worth wild. ","Summary":" From The Begining (chapter 1) A girl of about twenty-one sat high a top one of the many towers ofnt"},{"Movie":"Pianist","Title":"Gott mit uns","Author":"Portuguese Irish","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10103917","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's note: English and German are not my first languages, so I'm very sorry for any mistake. I only own my OCs, Erich Weiber and Vanya (Ivan) Vasnetsov. 'Gott mit uns', he read on the buckle of his belt. A distressed smile came across his lips. Yes, god... God, gods, spirits, whatever... none would come to help him, to help his friends and comrades. And why, after everything they had done? He looked around; once soldiers believing they were fighting for something, now war criminals, beasts. Hosenfeld looked up, to the dark sky above his head. It was about to rain, more mud for the already muddy POW camp. Some of his comrades were already dead, but no one would take the Germans out the filth. Seemed they deserved to be there. The ex-captain sighed and felt tears burn his eyes. He found himself crying his eyes out for no reason. No, actually there were many reasons. The strongest was fear. He was terribly afraid of dying in that camp, alone, with no one to mourn him. No one to miss him. No one to remember him. And that's what scares a man the most; oblivion. And judgement. Time passed by, even though he could not feel it. Everyone around him was dying and Hosenfeld couldn't help but laugh sadly to be the last man standing. And just when he thought he could give up on life, something happened. A Russian soldier came to him and dragged him by the mud. Hosenfeld understood he had been taken out of the camp. He was then shoved into the back seat of a car and he realised it was cold. He felt suddenly curious and looked around; who was responsible for that? For what he knew, his family had been killed during bombardments in Berlin. Someone covered him with a warm blanket and Hosenfeld saw a face he thought he would never see again; Władysław Szpilman. And he smiled, a true smile for the first time in what felt like ages, and allowed himself to fall asleep. He just couldn't believe that... He, who had such a promising career! He, who was the best from his division! He, who won a Ritterkreuz! He, the mighty arising, the one who had climbed from the lower class to the highest ranks, fighting everything and everyone! He, who only knew victories! He, who was now sitting at a corner, begging for food, faced for the first time with defeat. Still, Erich knew he was lucky, very lucky. His uniform was hidden under the big and heavy Russian trench-coat and that bunch of Polish civilians and Russian soldiers couldn't identify a perfect Arian face when they had one right under their noses. So time passed by, and Erich grew more and more miserable and more and more angry with Fate. Until the day that man came to him with a friendly smile. And Erich smiled back to the Hauptmann*. And right when he thought he couldn't be more miserable, Life tricked him; losing a leg and vision from the right eye wasn't enough, he had to be abandoned by his comrades and left to die in the snow, in a foreign country. He wasn't a skilled beggar. He was a helpless victim to everyone who passed by and thought he needed another bruise. And that was how he was found, lying in the middle of the street, half-buried in snow. * captain Weeee, review?[Chapter 2] Hosenfeld couldn't really believe his luck. During the first days he thought it all had been a dream, that he would wake up and find himself in the POW camp. But such didn't happen. He had a room of his own, a comfortable and warm bed, warm water to bathe, clean water to drink and warm food. And company. Later he found out that house had belonged to the Szpilman family, but now only one of them lived there. The others were all dead. And since the Jewish pianist didn't want to live alone in that place that brought so many memories, and Hosenfeld didn't have a place to go, he stayed there. It took a whole month for the German man to recover, and during that month Szpilman did nothing but make him company. They talked a lot and Hosenfeld was eager to learn Polish, find a job and help his recently found friend; he wanted to start a new life as soon as possible and try to bury the past. When Hosenfeld was finally able to do simple tasks like cooking or washing the dishes, Szpilman started to teach him some really basic Polish, and it didn't take long until the German could proudly present himself and name various types of food and furniture in Polish... with a terrible accent: \"I think I'm ready to go outside and face the world!\" Hosenfeld said one evening from the kitchen, after successfully making dinner and not burning anything. Lately the Jewish musician had been busy composing for the again operational radio where he had worked on before the war and Hosenfeld had declared himself the official cooker. Szpilman smiled, still sitting at the piano in the living room: \"Take it easy, if I let you go outside alone no one will understand what you say!\" he replied. However, it was difficult for both of them to take it easy; the musician, after starving and living alone and cold for years, always watching out for potential danger, and the German captain, obeying orders and ordering his soldiers to destroy, kill, and after spending that time in the POW camp, just wanted to have a normal life, live it fully and animatedly and try to ignore the still ruined buildings and piles of debris that surrounded them... and the Soviet occupants, who, thanks to Szpilman's influential contacts, hadn't yet caused troubles. \"My Polish is on the way to perfection!\" was the answer and Hosenfeld peeped from the kitchen. \"And your dinner is on the way to get cold.\" \"Yes, call it 'perfection'...\" Szpilman sighed, still smiling. He made his way to the kitchen and sat at the table, next to the German man. \"I'll talk to a few friends of mine who made it and came back... and see what I can get you,\" He started to eat, Hosenfeld had forgotten the salt again. \"Do you have anything in mind?\" \"To be honest, I have,\" The German man also realised the salt was missing. \"But it won't work.\" \"Care to tell?\" \"I'd like to do something related to the military, or the police,\" Hosenfeld smiled sadly. \"It's the only thing I do right, as you can see for what's in these dishes... and when I went to the military school I was told I'd help people, and I do want to help people.\" Szpilman just played with the food; one potato, one onion and one sausage. And they were lucky to have potatoes, onions and sausages to eat. Bread, only in special occasions. He looked at the former German officer and their eyes met: \"I'll see what I can do, but I can't promise you that,\" the musician replied. \"I can assure you a job in the radio, many that worked there left and didn't come back.\" Hosenfeld just nodded; anything would do, he just wanted to do something, start his life again. \"Can I ask you a favour?\" Szpilman asked during the morning pause. His friend came over and leaned against the piano: \"Sure!\" \"I have a friend living with me, he needs a job.\" \"Bring him, there's a lot of stuff to do here! And I know it's not much, but we pay the best we can...\" \"Do you think he'd have a chance as a policeman?\" Szpilman scratched his head. \"He was... a German officer.\" The other man frowned and looked around, making sure they were alone: \"A German officer,\" he repeated, trying to contain a mixture of fear and anger. \"A Nazi!\" \"A German officer who helped me, who gave me food and a place to stay, a friend among foes. A German officer who needed to leave and told me he hoped to listen to me playing in the radio again,\" Szpilman explained calmly. \"He saved my life, I saved his from a POW camp. The war is over, we just want to live again.\" \"He's German...\" \"He's an honoured and respectable man, who lost his family and has nowhere to go.\" \"Definitely, not the police,\" Szpilman's friend shook his head. \"He might be everything you say... but a German? No, no one would trust him. Someone would probably hand him to the Russians if his background was known...\" \"That's what I thought...\" Szpilman sighed sadly and his friend patted his shoulder: \"But you can always bring him... just tell him to never say a word, this is our secret.\" Back home, Szpilman found Hosenfeld reading a book. Or making a huge effort to do such. He closed the door and the German looked at him, shiny blue eyes and a big grin: \"I'm learning your History!\" he exclaimed proudly. \"It's interesting!\" \"So, who was our first king?\" Szpilman smiled and walked to the couch, where he sat next to the German man. Hosenfeld flipped through the book, frowning, and then pointed a portrait: \"Bolesław I Chrobry,\" Hosenfeld answered: \"My God, you're actually reading!\" And the pianist messed the German's hair with his hand, playfully. Hosenfeld closed the book and put it aside, his smile gone: \"You look tense, is anything wrong?\" he asked. The other man shrugged: \"Police and military are out of question for you,\" he explained. \"But you can work in the radio...\" They remained silent for a while, until the German man nodded. Though disappointed, Hosenfeld still felt immensely grateful for the opportunity. And he would go for it, and would help his friend, and with time the past would be just that... past. A few months gone by and the Winter arrived. Hosenfeld was actually enjoying working in the radio, everyone was very pleased with his work and nobody knew anything about him; for the time being, both he and Szpilman were safe. There was this day Szpilman needed to stay a little longer, playing for some important people who visited the building, and Hosenfeld went home earlier to make them something to eat. The noon was cold but sunny, and the thick layer of snow that had fallen until that moment in the city was nothing more than a bit of frost mixed with mud. Hosenfeld was walking calmly, looking around, and concluded that Warsaw was a beautiful place, despite the ruins of most buildings around him. In fact, life was a beautiful thing! Then he saw a beggar, sitting on the frosty ground at a corner. He frowned, concerned; from refugees and normal citizens to former soldiers or prisoners of war, lately many of them had become beggars, having lost their families, homes, jobs... Indeed, he was a lucky man. Hosenfeld crossed the street and walked to the beggar. He stopped in front of him and knelt, smiling in a friendly way, intending to give him comforting words, but then he froze. He knew that man. The first time he had seen him, it had been a beautiful day and he had been watching a Geländeretein (crosscountry) circuit, not far from Berlin, and that man had been riding a magnificent and powerful black horse and had been dressed in a black uniform. Hosenfeld's comrades had told him that man, at the time only nineteen years old, was already a SS-Sturmmann (Lance-corporal), a very talented one. And what an excellent sample of Germanic racial superiority he was! Now... there he was, age 25, miserable, dirty, needing a good shave and a good haircut, and no beautiful horse with him: \"Unterscharführer (Sergeant) Weiber?\" Hosenfeld called in a whisper. The man looked at him and smiled. \"Erich...\" \"Hauptmann Hosenfeld,\" he replied, smiling back. Or attempting to. \"Good to see you.\" \"My... What happened to you?\" Hosenfeld frowned, puzzled and concerned, looking deep into the pair of icy grey eyes in front of him. Those eyes were still the same, though; ageless, fearless... and full of hatred. Erich's smile grew, bitter, showing pointy canine teeth: \"I survived Budapest...\" was the answer. The older man sighed heavily; he had heard of the battle and of the fate of the 8th SS Cavalry Division. Hosenfeld looked around, biting his lip, then stared at Erich again; he knew that man, it felt wrong to just walk away and leave him there... but... taking him home sounded just as wrong; it was Szpilman's house, and it happened that Szpilman was Polish and Jew... and Erich was a fierce Nazi, a SS officer, a very proud one... Erich coughed. Hosenfeld rubbed his face with his hands, desperate, and sighed again before standing up and offering Erich a hand: \"Come with me,\" he said, And don't make me regret this. The younger man frowned, confused, but he accepted that hand. He let out a whimper as he stood up, chilled to the bone, sore and weak. Yet he managed to stand still and looked around, as if seeing that place for the first time. Hosenfeld bit his lower lip again; the younger man was still an impressive view, and, surely, he was still a dangerous man. Erich picked up his small backpack and followed Hosenfeld. \"Where are we, Herr Hauptmann?\" Erich asked when Hosenfeld closed the door after them: \"At a friend's house. A friend who is very dear to me,\" the former captain explained, seriously. \"And if you offend him I will kick you out again, are we understood?\" \"Jawohl, Herr Hauptman,\" Erich replied with a light frown; that friend of Hosenfeld was surely a very important and honourable man, he would show his compatriot he could handle the situation. Also, he was in no position of refusing help, and he would be most pleased in meeting the noble soul who had given shelter to the German captain. He looked around, studying the living room; it surely belonged to an educated person, with all those books and the piano near the window. He followed Hosenfeld upstairs and they stopped at the top of the stairs: \"That's my room, and the room next doors is my friend's,\" Hosenfeld explained, pointing the two doors at the left. \"These two are guest rooms, pick one for you,\" And he indicated the two doors in front of them. \"And there's the bathroom, but if you want hot water you have to warm it up on the stove. I'll do that for you.\" Erich just nodded, grateful, and got in one of the guest rooms as Hosenfeld made his way down again. The room was small, with a bed near the window, a chest at the feet of the bed and a big mirror in the wall opposite to the door. Erich frowned before his horrible reflection; he needed a good bath, a good shave and a good haircut. Hosenfeld came back some time later with two buckets of steaming hot water. Erich left his backpack over the bed and followed the older man to the bathroom: \"I'll wash those clothes and get new ones for you. Do you need help with your hair?\" Hosenfeld asked as he emptied the buckets in the bathtub. Erich shrugged: \"Thank you. I can do it myself, Herr Hauptmann,\" he assured. Hosenfeld just nodded: \"You have razors, scissors and a new comb in that cabinet, near the sink. I'll just get you clothes and a towel,\" And he left, closing the door behind him. Erich undressed the filthy Russian trench coat that hid his SS uniform from the world. With a sad smile, he toed off the riding boots and undressed the uniform. When Hosenfeld came back he was already in the water, trying to recall the last time he had had a bath like that. The former captain left his new clothes over a chair near the bathtub and grimaced when he noticed the uniform: \"It's very dangerous to walk around with this uniform,\" he scolded. Erich shrugged: \"The trench coat was big enough to hide it.\" \"Still,\" Hosenfeld picked up the dirty clothes. \"It should go... yet I presume you'll want to keep it...\" \"If it's possible,\" Erich smiled sadly again. \"Brings me good memories...\" Hosenfeld just sighed; he too still had his Wehrmacht uniform... He turned around and left the younger man alone; he needed a good excuse for Szpilman. Szpilman arrived home little later, tired and annoyed because the important people wanted him to play the same music over and over again. His annoyance turned into confusion when he found Hosenfeld in the kitchen, washing a SS uniform. The confusion turned into fear and he took a seat, already guessing the whole story. Hosenfeld tried to put on an innocent face, but the best he did was looking terribly guilty: \"I might have found someone I know... a SS officer, by the way... and... I might have brought him home because I felt sorry...\" he began to explain. Szpilman grew paler: \"A SS officer...\" he repeated lowly. Hosenfeld's eyes seemed bigger, shinier and more imploring: \"He's just a kid! I mean, not exactly a kid, but he's younger than us... And he's a good man, in spite of... being a fierce Nazi...\" Hosenfeld tried to smile. \"The knightly type... Very idealistic...\" \"He's going to kill me!\" Szpilman hissed, widening his eyes. \"Are you mad, Wilm? They... those SS... the concentration camp... the ghetto!\" \"He's not going to kill you!\" Hosenfeld assured, leaving the uniform in the basin full of water and coming to kneel in front of his friend. \"I won't let him. I just... just...\" But he sighed and bit his lower lip, sorrow written all over his face. \"I'm sorry, I'll tell him he has to leave...\" The Jewish musician looked around nervously, as if expecting the SS officer to show up with a Mauser pointed right at his head. But then he shook his head, trying to think clearly; Hosenfeld had a heart of gold, he hadn't mean to upset him or put him in a dangerous situation... He had just been... noble, again, like he had been with him, years ago. And... if Hosenfeld trusted that officer... so he couldn't be that bad... right? Szpilman rubbed his face and looked tiredly at his friend: \"No... he... he can stay... it's fine... I'm just...\" \"I shouldn't have done it, I'm so sorry! But... I couldn't leave him there!\" \"It's fine. Just... keep an eye on him, yes?\" Szpilman stood up and thought about going upstairs and locking himself in the room, but the SS officer was surely upstairs too, and he didn't want to meet him yet. So, he sat on the chair again and his hands were promptly taken by Hosenfeld's: \"His rank is lower than mine, he'll do whatever I say, I promise! He's absolutely fanatic about order and hierarchy.\" There was silence for a while, until Szpilman spoke again: \"So... I guess I'll make dinner while you finish washing that,\" And he stood up. Hosenfeld stood up too and looked worriedly at his friend: \"Are you angry with me, Wladek?\" he asked. Szpilman smiled shyly and shook his head, in an attempt to dismiss his fear and ease the situation: \"If you know him, it's because he's a good person... somewhere deep inside.\" When Erich looked himself in the mirror again he couldn't help but raise a surprised eyebrow; indeed, shaving and hair cutting really were magic tricks! He admired his aquiline nose and his strong jaw, and his perfect eyebrows and his thin lips that somehow seemed thinner after all those months. He didn't like the civilian clothes, though, but he was in no position of refusing things. He smiled bitterly and left the bathroom: \"Herr Hauptmann?\" he called: \"Küche!\" (Kitchen!) was the answer. Erich trotted downstairs, crossed the living room and entered the kitchen. Hosenfeld was there and he had another man with him, peeling potatoes. The man startled and the potato he was peeling and the knife fell on the table. Hosenfeld sighed and smiled. \"This is Wladislaw Szpilman, my friend and owner of the house.\" Erich smiled and stepped forwards, ready to shake hands with that man. However, before their hands touched, his smile died and he recoiled his hand, frowning: \"Wladislaw Szpilman... the Jewish musician?\" he asked, his grey eyes widening and moving to Hosenfeld, waiting for an explanation. Szpilman stepped back, quickly, looking at both Germans with frightened eyes. \"Ein Jude!\" (A jew!) \"Sei ruhig!\" (Quiet!) Hosenfeld growled, and he suddenly looked much bigger and stronger. \"I forbid you to address Herr Szpilman as 'Jew' or any other synonym of it!\" Erich clenched his jaw. \"Show some respect, you useless little soldier! Show some dignity, some gratitude! What kind of German are you, if you can't even show basic, civilized human emotions?\" Erich said nothing, hands behind his back, standing still with his legs slightly apart, head low. Only his eyes moved, and the moment they met Spzilman's, the musician suddenly felt the urge of hiding under the table or, better, behind Hosenfeld, who was now walking in circles around Erich: \"I will not tolerate this behaviour, Unterscharführer Weiber! Verstehen Sie mich?\" (Do you understand?) And Erich nodded quietly. \"I forbid you to leave the perimeter, and if you ever again address Herr Szpilman like that, I will personally hand you out to the Russian authorities. Ja?\" \"Jawohl, Herr Hauptmann,\" Erich replied after a minute of silence, head still low, eyes still moving furiously. Hosenfeld walked away from him: \"You should go upstairs and eat in your room, you seem a little nervous,\" he suggested. But they had been soldiers and officers, and Erich believed he was still a soldier... and an officer with a rank lower than Hosenfeld's, so the younger German nodded and made his way upstairs, locked himself in the room and cried his eyes out; at first tears of hate, but slowy wrath became humiliation, loneliness and the realisation that all of the things he believed in were gone. His only friend was gone. When Erich left the kitchen, Szpilman sat on a chair, trembling, and Hosenfeld breathed slowly and deeply: \"Obedient...\" the musician mumbled: \"I'm sorry... I should have referred to you with a fake name... to avoid this,\" the German man replied, scratching his head. \"I guess I'm going to confiscate his weapons, just in case.\" \"He has weapons?\" Szpilman grimaced. \"Can you please check if he didn't hide a tank under the bed? Or if he left an U-Boot in the bathtub, or mines in the living room...\" \"I can do it, yes,\" Hosenfeld smiled sadly. \"I'm really sorry...\" \"At least he didn't punch me or shot me; he just called me 'Jew', that's pretty nice from him!\" Szpilman picked up the knife and the potato that were abandoned over the table. \"I hope he's not one of those SS special forces that can open locked doors with clips, because it would be really unpleasant to wake up in the middle of the night with that... kid... trying to strangle me.\" \"Erich is not a sneaky bastard,\" Hosenfeld assured. \"He might be a dangerous fanatic, but he has more values and ethics than many Nazis I knew. He never killed an unarmed man and never attacked someone from behind, and that almost cost him his life for several times. All the medals he won were well-deserved and he's a very educated man. He's the perfect arthurian knight twisted beyond repair, I'm afraid.\" Szpilman looked around, dramatically: \"I see no horse!\" he concluded. Hosenfeld smiled, relieved. Weeee, review?[Chapter 3] T hanks for the review. :3 Two days gone by. Erich opted for a neutral, blank expression, he was quiet and spent most of time locked in his room, showing up only to help making their meals or to tidy up something when asked, and everytime he had to address Szpilman he would do it calmly and politely. The Jewish musician would actually believe Erich had already forgotten about their 'differences' if only Erich's eyes weren't that expressive; cold and piercing like a blade. Szpilman had never seen such an expressive pair of eyes, and he couldn't tell what terrified him the most; if Erich's cordial words, if the way the young German man looked at him. On the other hand, Hosenfeld was very proud of Erich's behaviour and chose to ignore how the younger ex-officer expressed his animosity towards Szpilman. But he didn't tell Erich what he thought, and decided that dealing with the younger man like he was still a soldier was the best option to keep the house pacific. That day Szpilman left work earlier than usual and was really annoyed when he had to walk into the little snowstorm outside. He was even more annoyed when he was almost reaching his destination and tripped on something that almost made him fall face first on the ground. Szpilman looked behind, frowning... and was that a man?: \"Oh my God!\" he whispered in horror and hurried to pull the semi-buried body from the snow. It was a Russian soldier, or maybe just a man with a Russian uniform, because he had no weapons. Szpilman knelt on the ground and rested the soldier's head on his legs, slapping his bruised face carefully. \"Please, tell me I didn't kill you! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you!\" The soldier opened his eyes, weakly, just to close them again almost instantly: \"Kill me...\" he muttered in his mother-tongue, but his words were lost in the wind. Szpilman looked around, panicking; should he take this man to the hospital? But the hospital was in the other side of the city! Maybe he should take him to the nearest Russian headquarters, but what if they thought he had done that to the soldier and arrested him and took him to martial court and...? Szpilman pulled his own hair, frustrated, and just to busy himself while thinking about what to do he started to shake the snow off the Russian's uniform. He then noticed the soldier just had his left leg and that his crutches were nearby, almost covered by the snow. He sighed, feeling helpless, I can't just walk away! \"Erich?\" Szpilman called. Surprisingly, Erich was in the living room, looking outside, and he slowly turned around to face the musician. \"Can you help me?\" The young German walked towards Szpilman, but when he noticed the Russian soldier the musician had dragged home his steps hesitated; a Jew was too much, a Jew and a Russian was... \"He's so cold! Heat up some water, will you?\" Szpilman asked as he dragged the soldier upstairs. Erich sighed sadly and made his way to the kitchen and did what he was asked. He then took the water upstairs and let Szpilman alone with the stranger, considering what was the wisest thing to do: shoot himself in the head or run away and freeze outside. Oh, but... Hosenfeld had confiscated his pistol, his ammo and his knife... and Hosenfeld had forbidden him to leave the perimeter... Desolated, Erich locked himself in his room and reached out for the backpack he had hidden under his bed. Meanwhile Szpilman managed to put the Russian soldier inside the bathtub. He was bony and fragile under the huge trench coat and the amputated leg, right under the knee, had some relatively recent scars and a few scabs that looked painful. His body was covered with bruises, he surely had one or two broken ribs and the right side of his torso was a maze of scars, a maze that crawled up to his shoulder, down his right arm and up the right side of his neck, finishing with thin and long scars across the right side of his face: \"What have you been though, lad?\" the musician asked, horrified; that man had to be the same age as Erich, if not younger. Slowly, the Russian opened his eyes and moved them, trying to see where he was. He began to shake, softly at first, but it increased in violence in a matter of seconds. The soldier had brown eyes, but the right one seemed a little foggy. Szpilman smiled: \"Hey!\" he saluted in a soft voice. \"How do you feel?\" But the soldier just frowned, shaking uncontrollably, with the saddest face Szpilman had ever seen. He bit his lip, the Russian probably didn't speak Polish: \"Deutsch, kannst du Deutsch?\" (German, do you speak German?) And the soldier's face lit up a bit, and he moved his arms slowly to wrap them around his torso, under the hot water: \"Ja. Ich habe... in der Schule gelernt!\" (Yes. I... learned in school!) he replied in a weak voice and a horrible accent. Szpilman nodded, kneeling next to the bathtub. The soldier looked around again, still shaking, and his smile died. \"Wo sind wir?\" (Where are we?) \"Bei mir. (At my place.) I'm going to help you.\" The Russian soldier just blinked his eyes, deadpan, but then he shook his head, slowly: \"You can't...\" he mumbled and his shaking body began to relax, adapting to the temperature. But Szpilman simply stood up and walked to the door: \"I have room enough for you and food and clothes are not a problem,\" he assured with a smile. \"I'm just going to get you some clothes and I'll be right back to help you.\" \"So, Ivan... how did you end up here?\" Hosenfeld asked slowly in German, breaking the unbearable silence at the dinning table. Ivan, sitting next to Erich, was visibly disturbed by the young German, silently smashing potatoes with his fork. The Russian soldier looked at Szpilman, using no words to beg him for help, and the Polish musician smiled at the older German soldier: \"I found him in the street,\" Szpilman said in Polish, and his smile died. \"He isn't very talkative... all I know is his name, that he came from Leningrad and that he learned German in school... Also, he begged me not to take him to his fellow Russians...\" \"He should be in bed,\" Hosenfeld opined in Polish too, looking at the frail Russian soldier, who could barely sit upright on the chair and was eating the mashed potatoes with sausage like his life depended on it. It was quite a barbaric and rude view, comparing to the very educated Erich next to him. Szpilman massaged his temples: \"I tried to leave him in bed, he crawled after me... You see Wilm, my guess is that even though he's not talkative, he doesn't want to be alone. God knows the horrors he's been through, you should have seen his scars...!\" \"He can't be older than Erich,\" Hosenfeld sighed, scratching his head. \"Have you called the doctor?\" \"I don't know if I should... because he's a soldier, and isn't with his comrades.\" \"That could be a problem, yes...\" \"I think he has one or two broken ribs, besides all the bruises. The amputated leg seems to be fine, though, which is good,\" And Hosenfeld just nodded, chewing his food absently. Szpilman ate in silence for a while, before proceeding. \"We earn enough to keep him. At least until the situation calms down...\" \"But what if the Russians search the house and find him?\" \"Let's hope they won't...\" Szpilman finished his meal and pushed the dish aside, then asked Ivan in German. \"Do you want some more?\" \"I'm fine, thanks,\" the young Russian mumbled, looking sheepishly at him. Szpilman didn't believe him, but didn't want to pressure him. So he just nodded with a friendly smile and looked at Hosenfeld again: \"Do you think your compatriot can befriend him?\" he asked hopefully. Erich had already stood up and was washing his dish and cutlery. Ivan was looking at him, then looked back at his dish, and again to Erich, who was now leaving the kitchen. Both men noticed the sad sigh that escaped the young Russian's lips: \"Befriend him? Impossible. Ignore him so that he will keep his promise of good behaviour? Certainly...\" Hosenfeld muttered tiredly. He stood up and Szpilman did the same, taking Ivan's dish: \"It's no problem!\" he assured when the soldier frowned and tried to stand up as well and wash his dish and cutlery, like he had seen Erich doing. The next day, playing the piano felt more difficult than what it actually was. Finally, a pause in the emission. Szpilman rubbed his face with his hands and closed his eyes for a moment, until he felt someone stop behind him and a big, comforting hand was placed on his shoulder: \"Wladek, what's troubling you?\" Hosenfeld asked softly. Szpilman looked up worriedly, then to the studio door, and back to Hosenfeld: \"You shouldn't be here!\" \"I know something's bothering you, is there anything I can do?\" \"It's just...\" Szpilman took a deep breath, looking down. \"I'm worried about Ivan, that's all.\" \"Erich won't hurt him, I told him to-\" \"I know, Wilm... It's just... I tried to talk to him again, this morning, but he didn't say a word... I'm worried.\" They heard steps. Hosenfeld had to keep pretending he was mute, so he simply squeezed Spzilman's shoulder affectionately, wishing he could do more to help his friend, and had to leave. The pause was over. With a sigh, Szpilman forced himself to focus and play. \"Danke schön,\" Ivan said when Erich placed a bowl of porridge in front of him. But, once more, the German didn't answer and sat at the opposite side of the table, the farthest he could from Ivan. The Russian soldier looked down, disappointed. That morning, when Erich had entered his room immediately after Szpilman left, he had thought he would have a chance to befriend the German soldier. Tell him how much he hated Stalin. Tell him he wanted to know more about the Führer, even if the war was lost to the Germans. Yet now Ivan doubted Erich would want to talk to him, leave alone be friends with him. He hadn't said a word; not while helping Ivan to get dressed, not while helping him downstairs, not while making them breakfast. And he was sitting away from him, that could only mean Erich didn't want anything to do with the Russian. Still, Ivan tried: \"I... I was in Leningrad,\" he told quietly, looking up to Erich. The German sighed, summoning patience, and, slowly, turned his head to look at the Russian. Erich fixed his piercing grey eyes on Ivan's, but the Russian felt nothing but compassion; he saw a man as broken as he, and knew they somehow would get to understand each other: \"I was in Budapest,\" Erich replied coldly before looking away again. \"Now shut up and eat.\" Weee, review?[Chapter 4] A week gone by. Much for Szpilman's dismay, Ivan still didn't talk. To him. Because he had caught Ivan trying to speak to Erich, following him around the faster he could until the German soldier locked himself in his bedroom and Ivan had no other option but to hide in his bedroom as well, disappointed. \"It's heartbreaking...\" Szpilman muttered one night, when Erich left the kitchen and Ivan hurriedly followed him. \"How... how can Erich, so young, be so... so cold ?\" \"He's not cold, Wladek... He's just angry,\" Hosenfeld sighed and collected his and Szpilman's dish and cutlery. He stood up and made his way to the sink. Szpilman shook his head as Hosenfeld, the kindest man he had ever met, and also the most untalented for domestic chores, began to spill water everywhere as he washed the dishes and cutlery. How could it be possible, that two men raised in the same regime, under the same orders, the same ideologies, could be so different? Why couldn't Ivan, whose scarred and amputated body evidenced the horrors he had lived, have a friend who had also been through the horrors of the war, someone to fully understand him? Why couldn't Erich, who Hosenfeld claimed to be a good soul under all the Nazi brainwashing, be indeed a good soul... be like Hosenfeld? The Jewish musician knew he was a lucky man, knew it because he had made it through the war... but in that moment he realised exactly how lucky he had been. Unlike Ivan, he had a friend to understand him, he had a friend to talk to, he had a friend to support him. Had the horror in his life been so much worst than the horror Ivan had gone through, that god had made it up for him through Hosenfeld? Hosenfeld closed the water tap and looked over his shoulder, frowning, taking in the sight of his friend; his tired, very tired friend. Hosenfeld knew Szpilman was worried with the Russian soldier, knew his friend would suffer because of a problem he couldn't solve. He went to sit at the table again, shaking his head: \"Wladek-\" \"It's not fair! For... for Ivan, even for Erich!\" Szpilman widened his eyes and slammed his hand on the tabletop, frustrated. \"Why-\" \"Wladek, calm down... please,\" Hosenfeld held his friend's hands, carefully, concern written all over his face. \"They are young... they don't know. But we are old fools. Old and overly sentimental.\" Hosenfeld succeeded in making Szpilman smile. The former officer nodded, pleased, and squeezed Szpilman's hands affectionately: \"You've done more than you can possibly imagine, Wladek... Life must go on,\" The German man stood up, pulling his friend with him. \"You have to focus in your career. Maybe finish that music that's been sitting on the piano since last week...?\" \"Do you know you are bossy?\" Szpilman asked in return, amused. He was so grateful Hosenfeld was there... When he was sure Hosenfeld and Szpilman had gone to work, Erich left his bedroom and made his way to the living room. He had been secretly reading a poetry book, one the many books in German that Szpilman had in display in the living room. Erich had just reached the stairs when he heard a door opening, at the far end of the corridor behind him, and the already familiar - and unwelcomed - sound of Ivan's only foot and crutches on the wooden floor. He glanced briefly over his shoulder, to see the former Russian soldier approach him the faster he could, eagerly, ridiculously thin in the large civilian clothes Szpilman had given him. Erich had to confess he didn't look better, though...: \"Wie geht's?\" (How are you?) Ivan asked, and Erich sighed, annoyed, and made his way downstairs: \"You've already asked that at breakfast...\" he grumbled. Ivan carefully began his way down: \"Bitte nicht schnell!\" \"Stop butchering my mother-tongue!\" Erich yelled and turned around to look at the young Russian man, who was halfway down the stairs. \"Aggravating Bolshevik!\" Ivan finally reached the first floor and followed Erich into the living room. It was a wide area, with a big window, a built-in bookshelf, a couch in front of it and, standing gloriously in the middle of the living room, Szpilman's piano and Hosenfeld's favourite armchair. Erich picked up the poetry book, sat on the couch and opened the book where he had stopped the day before. With a sigh, Ivan sat next to him. Silence stretched between them, exactly like in the previous week. Ivan looked sadly at Erich, imagining they could actually get along if only the German didn't play deaf, didn't run upstairs to hide in his room or didn't yell at him, telling him to shut up. He decided to give it another try: \"I want to go West,\" he told quietly. \"London. And you?\" Erich kept reading, like Ivan wasn't there at all. The Russian shrugged and proceeded: \"Comrade Szpilman seems a good man... but I don't know if I can trust him. I'm afraid he'll hand me over to the NKVD if he knows I want to go West...\" Ivan looked at Erich, who still ignored him completely. \"But he wouldn't, right? His friend is a Nazi too, like you. Isn't he? He would not hand me over to the NKVD when he's living with a Nazi, right?\" Erich slammed the book shut and looked at Ivan, grey eyes piercing as a blade and mouth wide open to yell at him. One of his fists was closed and raised, and would surely collide with Ivan's face. But a horse neighed outside and Erich froze in the spot, only to recover in a matter of seconds, jump to his feet and run to the window, peeking carefully from behind the curtains. Curiously, Ivan stood up and hopped on his only leg to the window. Being practically the same height as Erich, he had to crane his neck to peek over Erich's blond head. A cavalry regiment was crossing the street. Abruptly, Erich stepped back, colliding with Ivan, who lost his balance and fell backwards on the floor. The young Russian man cursed as pain flared in his ribcage, but he managed to drag himself to the couch and, with the help of his crutches, stood up and followed Erich upstairs. Of course, when he made it to the second floor, Erich was already hidden in his bedroom. Ivan knocked at the door, but it was useless. Defeated, he made his way to his own bedroom. Later that day, while Hosenfeld went upstairs to bathe, Szpilman made dinner. And he was setting the table when Ivan came in the kitchen: \"Hallo,\" Szpilman saluted with a friendly smile. Ivan looked at him, with his characteristic sad face, then looked at the table and shrugged: \"I don't think Erich is coming, comrade Szpilman...\" the former soldier muttered and sat on his chair. Szpilman was momently shocked; Ivan had never told him that many words before. He hurriedly finished to set the table and pulled his own chair closer to Ivan's, smiling widely: \"Ah! So... so you are friends! Is he alright?\" Ivan shook his head, sadly: \"He's not my friend... He doesn't want to,\" he sighed. \"I think he's upset, he won't come down.\" \"Why is he upset?\" But by no means could Szpilman make Ivan talk more. Anyway, some progress had been made, and the pianist presumed the former Russian soldier was simply shy. Hosenfeld joined them little later, his damp hair sticking to his head: \"Ivan said Erich is upset, so he isn't coming down,\" Szpilman said, and that made Hosenfeld frown, turn around and go back to the second floor, only to knock at the door of Erich's bedroom and have no answer: \"Weiber?\" Hosenfeld called. He waited a bit, and finally Erich opened the door. And the first thing Hosenfeld noticed was that Erich's grey eyes, so cold and hard and full of hatred, were reddened and sad. The former captain frowned. \"Is everything alright, Weiber?\" \"I'll be down in a minute, Herr Hauptmann...\" Erich carefully avoided the question that had been made to him and closed the bedroom door again. Later, when there were just Szpilman composing at the piano and Hosenfeld listening, sitting in his favourite armchair near the piano, the German man decided to tell his friend what had happened: \"Erich had been crying, and for a long time,\" he stated when Szpilman paused the music to note down something: \"Ivan said he was upset, but didn't tell me why,\" Szpilman replied and turned around on the piano bench to face his friend: \"I asked him if he was alright, he was evasive...\" Hosenfeld rubbed his temples. \"Wladek, what are we going to do with them? I've seen more Russian soldiers in the streets... If I let Erich go, he'll get himself killed; if you let Ivan go, he'll probably get caught by his compatriots and deemed a traitor...\" \"I've been thinking about that...\" Szpilman bit his lower lip and they made their way to the couch. Szpilman had nothing to fear from the Russians, but he did fear for Hosenfeld and for their two guests. Hosenfeld was right, Erich and Ivan couldn't stay there forever, it wasn't safe... and maybe Hosenfeld shouldn't stay there as well... The thought that he might lose his only friend, his saviour, the only person who made the after-war bearable, had Szpilman panicking. He let out a strangled sob as tears began to run down his face. He was vaguely aware of Hosenfeld's voice, apologising for bringing up the subject and promising him everything would be alright. Yet he was fully aware than Hosenfeld embraced him tightly, still mumbling apologies against his shoulder, and the feeling of the former captain's arms around him slowly calmed him down. They stood like that for a long moment, until Szpilman's breathing was normal again. Their heads were resting on each other's shoulders: \"I'm sorry, Wladek... I didn't want to-\" Hosenfeld whispered once more, but Szpilman interrupted him: \"I don't want to be alone again,\" he blurted out, clutching to his friend, like he was drowning and Hosenfeld was the only thing that kept him anchored to life. It was selfish, Szpilman knew, but that was the truth: \"You won't, Wladek. I'm not going anywhere! Heck, I don't want to be alone, too!\" \"But it's not safe for you! What if-\" \"Then we 'll leave!\" Hosenfeld moved away a bit and tilted Szpilman's head up. He was smiling, reassuring, and Szpilman could see why men had followed Hosenfeld to battle. Why Erich hadn't killed him yet. \"But for now... we're going to sleep. Yes? Then we can start planning things.\" \"I have friends who can help us,\" The pianist nodded, eagerly, and allowed himself to smile as well. Weee, review?[Chapter 5] Author's note: thanks so much for the reviews... ;-; The next day, while going back to his bedroom after breakfast, Erich planned to remain there, hidden alone and in peace, for the rest of the day. But by then he should have known that, sooner or later, Ivan would be knocking at his bedroom door, butchering his much beloved German tongue with those broken phrases, heavy accent and inexistent declinations. And Ivan was particularly insistent. Hissing curses under his breath, Erich eventually jumped off the bed and yanked the door open: \"What?\" he asked through gritted teeth as Ivan simply stood there, looking at him: \"Everything fine?\" Ivan asked in return, only to have the door shut on his face. Because Erich didn't leave the room, there was no lunch. And because there was no lunch, Ivan was extremely hungry at dinner. But he didn't want to be rude and ask Szpilman for more food, so he had to be content with just one dose of soup and just one dose of the main dish: \"Where's Erich?\" Hosenfeld asked when the soup was over and Szpilman served the main dish. Ivan just shrugged: \"Didn't come down the whole day,\" he told: \"Why's that?\" Szpilman asked curiously, hoping Ivan would be inspired to talk to them. But Ivan just shrugged again, emptied his dish in a matter of minutes and, after a brave attempt at washing his dish and cutlery - that he couldn't, because he couldn't balance himself in just one leg without the crutches with his ribs still recovering - he made his way upstairs. The Russian soldier stopped for moments before the door of Erich's bedroom. He considered knocking again, maybe tell Erich the other German man, Hosenfeld, had asked for him. But he knew Erich wouldn't bother to open the door, so Ivan simply sighed in resignation and proceeded to his own bedroom. That night Ivan couldn't sleep. He was feeling better, even though his ribcage still hurt sometimes and he was still weak and still felt a limb that wasn't there anymore. All things considered, he had no reasons to remain in that place, where the only one he saw as a potential friend wanted nothing to do with him, and where he was afraid he could be handed over to the Soviets. Ivan had no money - it had been stolen at the military hospital from his belongings - but, with stupid innocence, he thought he would be able to find his way. He decided to wait until morning, because a beggar in the daylight sounded less suspicious than a beggar sneaking out of the city at night. And maybe after breakfast he wouldn't be this hungry... And so Ivan waited for the morning, tossing and turning in bed. When morning came he went down for breakfast and found Szpilman, Hosenfeld and Erich already in the kitchen. The two Germans spoke lowly between them and Ivan was curious as to what they were talking about, and he wished he had learned more in school so that he wasn't such a basic speaker with poor comprehension of what he heard. Maybe Erich would talk to him, if only he spoke better German... Ivan noticed Szpilman looking at him, expecting him to say something. But Ivan didn't; he couldn't bring himself to trust Szpilman. What if Szpilman handed him over to the Soviets? Ivan would be deemed a deserter and would be sent to a gulag, and dying alone, in the cold in a foreign country as a beggar, was still a better fate than being shipped away to a gulag. Ivan hurriedly ate breakfast and left, leaving Erich, Hosenfeld and Szpilman in the kitchen. Szpilman watched Ivan go, then sighed in disappointment and looked at Erich: \"Why don't you talk to him?\" he asked quietly. Erich exchanged a look with Hosenfeld, who nodded, indicating that ignoring Szpilman's question wasn't an option. Resigned, Erich looked at Szpilman, looking at him with all the hatred he couldn't voice: \"His German isn't good,\" he simply replied, leaving unsaid political and racial reasons that would only make Hosenfeld yell at him. Erich didn't need the Hauptmann yelling at him right now, thank you very much. He hurried to finish breakfast and left. Szpilman and Hosenfeld found themselves alone in the kitchen. Hosenfeld served himself another slice of bread and spread a thin layer of butter on top of it: \"Wladek, you can't do more for them than what you already did...\" Hosenfeld repeated. Szpilman sighed and finished drinking his tea: \"I know... It just...\" He stood up, collected his empty dish and teacup and walked to the sink. He then smiled, because at least he had a friend. \"Well... hurry up, you glutton! We're going to be late!\" \"I'm not a glutton!\" Hosenfeld complained with fake aggravation, but hurried to finish breakfast. Waiting expectantly in the bedroom, Ivan heard the already familiar fuss of Szpilman and Hosenfeld getting ready to leave to work, and finally the sound of the front door opening and closing. After that... silence. Ivan, sitting at the edge of the bed, scrambled up with the help of his crutches and put on his backpack with his few belongings. He had changed to his Russian uniform, so hopefully, in the eventuality of his capture, he would be recognized by his compatriots, and perhaps they would pity him for the injuries he had suffered and not send him to a gulag; instead - hopefully - they would leave him alone to die. Carefully, Ivan opened his bedroom door and peeked outside. The corridor was empty, and no sound came from Erich' bedroom. Ivan made his way to the stairs, as silently as possible, and began his way down. Sadly for him, that was the day he finally stumbled and rolled down the stairs, too confused to scream in pain as his injured ribs collided with wooden steps and finally hard wooden floor. His crutches, falling down the stairs in infernal racket, landed next to him and what followed was a mortifying silence. Ivan, in pain but too afraid to allow himself to whimper, expected to hear Erich. But there was just silence. As fast as he could, Ivan stood up and walked to the front door. He had noticed Szpilman kept a spare key inside the first drawer of the small chest of drawers next to the door, and he used the spare key to unlock the door as silently as possible and go outside. The morning was freezing and Ivan shivered as the wind and snow bit at the exposed skin of his face. He wanted to close the door silently, but the wind caused it to slam shut, the sound echoing ominously. Terrified that someone might have seen him, the Russian soldier looked around... but the street was empty, and from the nearby houses no one came to the window. Erich was lying on the bed and staring at some pictures he carried on his wallet when he heard Ivan cross the corridor and, shortly after, fall down the stairs. He frowned, and waited to hear the Russian cry out in pain and beg someone for help. Such didn't happen, which meant Ivan was either fine... or dead. Erich couldn't care less if Ivan was alive or not, but the thought that Hosenfeld would probably think he had purposefully pushed Ivan down the stairs made the young German man put the pictures aside, jump to his feet and walk to the bedroom door. And the moment he opened it, he heard the front door slam shut. Erich froze, imagining that, for some reason, Hosenfeld had returned. And he would find Ivan sprawled on the floor, and would assume Erich had pushed the Russian and- Nothing. No one came in. With a frown, Erich walked to the stairs... and Ivan wasn't lying dead at the bottom of the stairs. Erich's frown grew bigger: \"Ivan?\" he called, and walked back to the corridor and noticed the door of Ivan's bedroom was open. Cursing, Erich peeked into the bedroom... and it was empty. Ivan had left. Erich wouldn't be bothered if it wasn't for Hosenfeld. The Hauptmann would think he had done something, and would hate him, and Erich couldn't bear the thought of letting down a superior officer, especially Hosenfeld, who he had known before the war and who he held in great esteem. Cursing at the top of his lungs, Erich ran into his own bedroom and opened the chest at the feet of the bed where he had kept his uniform. He put on his riding boots, hoping it wouldn't be too odd to see a man in civilian clothes and shiny riding boots, and then bolted downstairs. He grabbed a coat and a beret from the coat hanger, put them on and was about to open the door when he remembered Hosenfeld forbidding him to leave the house. Erich froze, because he couldn't disobey a direct order. However, he couldn't disappoint Hosenfeld, either... and letting Ivan get killed would disappoint Hosenfeld. Groaning his hatred for Ivan, Erich removed the spare key from the door, shoved it into his pocket and left. It was snowing, but fortunately it wasn't a blizzard, and the very obvious tracks of Ivan's only foot and crutches were well visible in the snow. Erich sighed in relief and strode following the tracks, hoping no one would see him and think his features too Germanic for a Polish citizen. At that time of the morning the street Ivan had gone through was empty, and Erich was glad the Russian soldier had had that bit of wisdom to avoid people and patrols. Erich followed the tracks, that at the end of the street disappeared into a long, narrow alley. Erich walked along the alley, now with doubled attention because the tracks weren't as clear as before, since there wasn't much snow in the alley. A dog barked some blocks away. The tracks went into another alley, and so did Erich. However, the German soldier realised with dismay, the tracks were now useless; Ivan was curled on the ground few meters ahead, desperately holding to his crutches, that a man was trying to pull away from him. Erich presumed the man would want the wood crutches as fuel to a fireplace, to cook and to warm himself. Erich also realised he should have brought his dagger... Still, unarmed, Erich strode to the Russian man and to his assailant, who in the meantime had successfully yanked the crutches from Ivan's hands and now intended to beat him up. Yet the man, upon noticing Erich's approach, ran away with the crutches. Erich stopped near Ivan and bent over the Russian. Ivan's lower lip was split and he was looking at Erich with scared wide eyes: \"You're just so stupid!\" Erich complained and helped Ivan up. The Russian soldier moved stiffly and pressed a hand over his sore rib cage. Ivan said nothing and looked down. He felt extremely ashamed and useless. He couldn't even run away... Ivan didn't hear Erich complain about his stupidity and on how he could have gotten them both in trouble. Ivan wasn't even aware of Erich practically dragging him back to Szpilman's house, hurrying so that they wouldn't be seen. All Ivan knew was that he was back to stage zero, and that he was useless and maybe Szpilman would end up handing him over to the Russians. And that now Erich despised him more than ever... Erich realised in dismay that Ivan was freezing cold. He prepared the Russian a hot bath, always complaining about his stupidity, then left him in bed and went to make porridge to give him. Ivan didn't feel like eating, but he also didn't want to further upset the German. So he complied, ate spoonful after spoonful of porridge that Erich, sitting at the edge of the bed, gave to him. Erich was quiet and Ivan supposed he had ran out of insults. When Erich left downstairs with the then empty bowl of porridge, Ivan sank deeper in the soft mattress and pulled the blankets up to his shoulders. He wished he could disappear. Maybe he should try to leave the house again, this time without alerting Erich... Erich had noticed Ivan was missing because he fell from the stairs, it had to be it... The Russian blamed himself for having lost a leg and for his clumsiness. Then Ivan remembered, bitterly, that his crutches were gone. By no means he would be able to go far without his crutches. Erich returned little later and sat at the edge of Ivan's bed again, arms crossed and narrowed eyes: \"I'll stand guard. You're not going anywhere again, I don't want Herr Hauptmann and the Jewish man falsely accusing me of having gotten rid of you!\" the German hissed. They stared at each other for a moment, until Ivan looked down: \"I wouldn't mind, if you killed me... or let me die...\" he mumbled. \"Seems I'm already a prisoner...\" \"Why don't you shoot yourself, then?\" Erich picked up Ivan's backpack from the floor and waved it in front of the Russian soldier, but out of his reach. Ivan widened his eyes and tried to grab his backpack, but Erich simply kept it out of reach: \"I don't have a pistol!\" Ivan complained, and he didn't want Erich to rummage through his backpack. Sadly for him, Erich rested the backpack over his knees, opened it and peeked into it. The German soldier frowned and, suspiciously, retrieved a battered notebook from the bottom of the backpack. He narrowed his grey eyes and discarded the backpack to the floor: \"Are you a spy, you bastard?\" Erich hissed and opened the notebook. Ivan shrank further under the blankets, his wide and scared eyes never leaving Erich. He mentally prayed to a god he had ceased to believe in that Erich wouldn't destroy the notebook. Erich tilted his head, curiously. The notebook... was filled with drawings. The first few drawings were big enough for whole pages, detailed, with black ink lines and charcoal shadings. They depicted various streets, empty and ghostly, and the last full-page drawing was of a house with tattered walls but with a standing door. From then on the drawings became smaller, several of them in the same pages, and there was less detail. And now the drawings depicted fire and ruins, and disfigured humanesque faces and bodies. There were drawings of soldiers and of hooded figures shrouded in black. There were drawings of birds caught in thorn bushes and of men caught in barbed wire. There were drawings of eyes lurking from clouds of smoke and mouths screaming in agony. The more pages Erich turned, the smaller and rougher the drawings became. At some point, no more black ink was used to make lines, and the shadings were gone, and the drawings were simply made of charcoal. However there were some drawings, though one of them was in the last page of the notebook, that had been painted in red; the first two were an eye and an intelligible maze of lines, and the last was a severed leg above the knee. Whatever had been used to paint those drawings, it hadn't been a pencil. Erich slowly lifted his eyes to Ivan, frowning. The Russian soldier simply stared back at him, expecting judgement or the destruction of his notebook. The tense silence between them became awkward, and Erich closed the notebook and carefully handed it to Ivan. Ivan snatched the notebook from Erich's hands and held it against his chest, like it was the most precious thing in the world and worth dying for in its defense: \"You did that?\" Erich asked curiously, and Ivan nodded, licking his lips: \"It's all I have that is mine , \" he muttered, his voice so low and his accent so heavy Erich almost didn't understand him. \"They wanted to burn everything: newspapers, magazines, books, little girl's diaries...\" Ivan hid a little further under the blankets, making his notebook disappear. \"They'd kill you if you refused, accuse you of sabotage... Everything was to be burned to make fire and fight off the cold.\" He paused, looking Erich in the eyes. \"I didn't tell anyone about my notebook. I didn't want it to burn. It was my only way to... talk.\" Erich remembered Ivan telling him he had been in Leningrad. Erich knew the city had been under siege for two years and some more months, but he had had more to be concerned about than keeping up with a siege far too north from his position in Budapest. He, too, had lived through the siege, and he was the last living soldier of his cavalry division. The German clenched his jaw and looked away from Ivan: \"Who are «they»?\" he asked, and when Ivan answered his voice was so full of hatred that Erich immediately looked back at him: \"The Soviets.\" Erich frowned: \"I had Ukrainian and Russian comrades... Cossacks,\" he told. \"They hated Stalin and communism.\" \"And so do I.\" Ivan shrank yet again under the blankets, and now only his head was left out. Like he feared that speaking against Stalin and his regime would summon the NKVD, but that somehow hiding under the blanks would protect him and his notebook. Erich's frown grew deeper, and he crossed his arms in front of his chest: \"Why?\" \"I lost everything! My family, my friends, my family's belongings...! All for nothing!\" Ivan was angry, and the angrier he grew the more incomprehensible he became, with his heavy accent and mixing up German and Russian. \"Just because my dad was wealthy and didn't like the new system! He didn't even have a trial! He was simply snatched from home and we never saw him again! And then they came for my mom! And for my brother, in the university!\" Ivan paused, his brown eyes wide. \"But they didn't come for me...! They just... dragged me to the army...\" The German presumed Ivan was talking about some sort of police for internal affairs. Maybe like the Gestapo. Only that the Gestapo would never make the mistake of leaving a potential suspect behind, like the Russian police had done to Ivan. But... looking at Ivan, so thin and fragile and probably as stupid as he looked, the Russian police had presumed Ivan was no threat. The thought almost made Erich chuckle, but he decided to be polite, because Ivan's hate for Stalin and communism interested him, and maybe it could be useful for later. Maybe Erich would manage to gather a force to fight off the Russians, maybe it would be possible to achieve the Führer's dreams. Erich sighed and stood up: \"I'm going to make lunch,\" he said, pointing a threatening finger at Ivan. \"Don't you even dare leaving the bed.\" Weeeeee, review?

Lancelot never meetsnGuinevere, atleast not until Arthur and her are married, and evennthen, there is no relationship between her and Lancelot except anfriendship and trust. The night of the ceremony, it is Lancelot whonmakes love to Morgaine, not Arthur, and thus the story is changed. Disclaimer : None ofnthe characters are mine. Please read and enjoy. Please dont bashnme, this is my first time writing to this movie. Thanks! Chapter 1 ( Everything is the samenup until Lancelot comes to Avalon, where we begin ) Morgaine gave Lancelot anhug. \"It's so good to see you!\" She told him. \"And you.\" nLancelot gave her a very deep hug and when they backed out of it, hensmiled at her hugely. His mother had informed him that he was goingnto marry her, but not until after he was the hunter in the ceremony,nand she his bride. They ran up to the ruins,nwhere they always went to talk. Lancelot could not take his eyesnfrom her. \"What?\" She asked. \"I've never seen thatnlook before.\" He smiled a huge smile atnher and hugged her again. \"Are you feeling what I'm feeling?\"n He asked her. \"A strange feelingndeep inside me? Yea, I am feeling that.\" She replied andnsmiled at him. \"Good to know I'm not the only one.\" He smiled at her and keptnone of his hands in hers. He kissed her gently on the top of hernhand. She moved it to his face and he kissed her deeply on the lips. \"It's not proper, Inmust not.\" She tried to move away, but Lancelot only pulled herncloser. \"Mother hasn't toldnyou?\" He looked at her questioningly. \"Told me what?\" nShe relaxed in his embrace. \"Well, we are to benmarried, officially. I am going to be the hunter in the ceremony,nand you the bride, and after we make love for the first time, we arengoing to be married.\" Lancelot smiled at her affectionately. n\"That is, if you'll have me...\" His voice trailed off. \"Of course.\" nShe smiled at him again and they kissed once more. They walked downnthe path back to the main part of the island, where all thenpriestesses lived. Viviane had been watching the whole time, and shenknew what had just happened. She was glad that Lancelot agreed withnher that marrying Mogaine was a good idea, and she was also glad thatnthey made such a good match. \"What have you twonbeen up to?\" She asked, as they entered her house. \"Just walkingnaround.\" Lancelot laid down on the bed that was basically thenonly form of furnature to relax on in the whole place, apart from anfew chairs, which he found very uncomfortable. Viviane looked at the twonof them, mischief in her eyes. She was not going to do anythingnstupid, oh no, she was just going to look into the future and seenwhat more their future had in store. She smiled at them. \"Well,nI am going to go and work outside, on my garden.\" She smiled atnthem and left. \"She seemed like shenwanted us to be alone.\" Morgaine noticed. \"Strange.\" nLancelot replied. \"But then again, that is my mother.\" nBoth gave a chuckle at the statement. The night of the ceremony,nLancelot raced after the deer. He carried it back to the cave wherenMorgaine lay. She was nervous, but he lifted the mask just a bit tonshow her it was him. She relaxed when she saw his face and allowednhim to do what he wished the rest of the night. The next day, she actednlike she had no idea who had been the hunter from the night before,nbut Viviane knew that Morgaine was well aware of everything. \"Yournwedding is today.\" She smiled at Morgaine who smiled back. n\"Are you nervous?\" She asked. \"No.\" Morgainenreplied. \"I love Lancelot passionately, I have no fear ofnspending the rest of my life with him.\" \"That's good, it isnas it should be.\" The elder priestess responded. That night, the weddingntook place. Lancelot came out wearing a full suit of armor. He wasnfollowed by Arthur, who recognized his sister and smiled at her. n\"Hello sis!\" He embraced her. \"Congratulations!\" \"Arthur!\" Shensmiled at him hugely, he was her little brother all right, and henwould always be. \"What brings you to Avalon?\" \"What brings me tonAvalon?\" He looked at her puzzled. \"Well, you gettingnmarried!\" \"Oh that.\" Shensmiled at Lancelot and they turned to face Merlin who married them. nWhen the ceremony was over, Lancelot carried Morgaine off to a housenthat was empty, where they would spend two weeks together.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Married life fit Lancelotnand Morgaine perfectly. Their house was near, yet far away, fromnVivaine's. The grass was green, their life was beginning together,nand yet, Lancelot felt a calling to the world of the normal man, anplace where he could fight and feel strong. So, each day, Vivainenallowed him to go and come back, and although the ride was long, henwould always make it. He was training soldiers for a battle, onenthat Vivaine only told him of, one that was going to happen, when? nHe had no idea. As he returned one night,nMorgaine met him at the dock. \"Darling, what are you doingnhere? It's so cold out.\" Lancelot smiled at her and wrappednhis arms around her. \"Guess what?\" nHer voice was mysterious. She smiled at him widely, hoping thatnVivaine had not told him anything. \"What?\" Henasked placing his cloak around her. She took his hand and laidnit on her stomach. \"You are???\" Lancelot's voice rosenwith excitement. \"Oh my gosh!\" He was extatic. Morgaine smiled at him andnhe embraced her, tears welling in his eyes. \"I'm glad yournhappy, I was too.\" She pulled him close and he scooped her upnlike she was nothing. \"I'm going to be andaddy!\" He announced as he entered the main part of Avalon,nwhere people were singing and dancing around a campfire. Everyonenaround the campfire cheered and Lancelot entered his house where henset Morgaine down. He smiled at her hugely. \"This has been onenof the happiest days of my life!\" Morgaine had not stoppednsmiling since she had met up with Lancelot. \"I am so glad younare home.\" She relaxed on the bed, where she had spent most ofnthe day. \"Are you okay? Can Indo anything for you?\" Lancelot asked, holding one of her handsnin his. \"Yea, you can layndown and relax.\" She replied giving a chuckle. \"You havenbeen out training for how long now?\" Lancelot smiled at thatnand laid down next to her. \"How many kids do you want?\" nHe asked, pulling her to him gently. \"Well, I think two isna great number.\" Morgaine replied. \"Or three, or howevernmany the goddess will give us.\" She gave him a quick kiss onnthe lips and when they backed out of it, they smiled at eachother. \"I love younMorgaine.\" Lancelot wrapped his arms around her a bit tighternand buried his face in her hair. \"Whats wrong?\" nShe asked him, noticing the sudden scared look on his face. \"I just -\" Henbegan. \"It's just that every time I come here, I have a vision.n You need to stay away from the woman with red hair.\" Henstroked her cheek gently. \"Okay. Who is she?\"n Morgaine asked. \"I think she is yournaunt, and no matter what happens to me, do not let her near ournchildren. Please.\" Lancelot looked at her seriously. \"Okay, I promise.\"n Morgaine vowed. Lancelot let out a sighnand hugged her again. Morgaine was worried, but said nothing. &&&&&&\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" (( Arthur gets Excaliburnright now, EXACTLY the same way as the movie )) \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Tell me what you thoughtnof this chapter please! More detail or not? Did I captureneverything correctly? Let me know! Thanks![Chapter 3] Part 3 It came time for Arthurnand Guinevere to be married, and Lancelot and Morgaine came right onntime. Everyone was introduced properly and the wedding ceremonynbegan. It was basically 3 days of feasting. Arthur complained tonMorgaine about how he lost in the ceremony to be the hunter, and shenonly replied how it was probably for the best. He nodded sadly andnthey met up with Guinevere and Lancelot who were talking as new in -nlaws. Seeing Lancelot withnanother woman made Morgaine nervous for a few moments, but when shencame and put her arm around him, she was reassured by the kindness innhis eyes. She also saw how her brother was with Guinevere, verynloving and sweet, different than with any other woman. As they ate, the menntalked of war and battle, and all the women talked of their childrennand shopping in the villages. It was typical. The night wore on andnMorgaine's aunt put a spell on Guinevere so that she would never benable to bear children. She did not know that Morgaine was withnchild, and Morgaine would never tell her. Morgaine and Lancelot werenboth of a royal blood - line, and their child would succeed Arthur'snthrone, no matter what. That night, Arthur andnMorgaine spoke in their room. \"I saw the red haired womanntoday, she is scary in a wicked way.\" \"Most likely my aunt.n We just have to stay away from her, and if she comes near us, wenshould just be nice, but not mention the fact that I am with child. nAll she wants is for her son to be put on the throne after Arthur, Incan see it. She wants to make England hers, and take away all thatnwe have ever beleived in.\" Lancelot had his head in her lap andnlooked up at her solemnly. \"Yes, I agree. Wenmust be very careful. Mother tells me she sees a huge war coming tonall of us in the near future. With her, the near future could be upnto 20 years, but it still means many will die in it.\" Henexplained. \"Has Merlin told younanything?\" \"No, he is too busyntraining the men of Avalon. For what? I have no idea. I can onlynhope that when this battle comes, Avalon will aid us.\" Morgaine nodded and rannher hand through his hair. She was spacing out. \"Do you thinknour child will be a boy or a girl?\" She asked Lancelot. \"Boy. And the nextnone will be a girl.\" He replied. \"That way, we have annheir to this throne. Something tells me we are going to need two.\" She laughed. \"Yea,nyour needs tell you we need two.\" He smiled. \"Nonno...I insist, two will be better than one!\" They were playing,nand having fun at it. \"Okay, two it is.\"n Morgaine said. \"How about 4?\" nLancelot played. \"Three!\" nMorgaine played back. \"Three and a half...\" \"That's not funny!\"n Morgaine replied. They laughed and continuednjoking until they got tired. Their relationship was one to benenvied. It was serious yet fun and it held the future of Avalon asnwell as Camelot in it. Their children would be the next in line tonthe thrones of both.[Chapter 4] THANK YOU FOR THE REVIEWS. HERE IS CHAPTER TWO. Chapter 4 Morgaine returned to Avalon, and she did not enter the world of man for another 12 years. In that time, she gave birth tothe twins, twohealthy babies; a boy named Xander and a girl named Helena. They were both very cute, and with their mother and grandmother both as Priestesses, they learned the way of old for the first 12 years of their life. It was when Lancelot came home one day that he told his wife it was time to be on the mainland, with the people of Arthur. He told her of the great battle he foresaw, and how Xander was going to play a part in it. Guinevere had given birth to a son, and he was weak, and mean, and not the type of man anyone wanted ruling Camelot. \"Why does Xander play a part in it?\" Morgaine asked, she was worried for her only son. \"Because it comes down to him and his cousin Hector. Hector challanges him for the throne, and only one will win. Mother and father, ( Merlin is Lancelot's father, at least in my story. ) have told me these things. They almost never lie, but it is possible to change the future from them.\" \"And what part do I play?\" Helena asked. \"I'm not sure yet. I will find out later. For now, we must move into the world of man. I am making a huge decision, one that I know you don't like, and we can return whenever we wish, afterall, we have mother and father here, but it is time for a change, and son, you need to learn how to fight, and I don't have the time to teach you here. I will have more time after work. So, we will move in two weeks.\" Lancelot explained. Morgaine did not argue with him, only agreed. That night, after the children were in bed asleep, Morgaine asked Lancelot if his parents knew. He had told them already, and although they did not approve, they were not angry at him. \"You don't have to come with me if you don't want to.\" Lancelot told Morgaine. \"But I love you, and I love our children, and I want to be with you all. Yes, I do love Avalon as well, but my family is more important, and if you see that the world of man is a better place for our family, then I will follow you there and make our life as good as I possibly can there. I lived there for awhile too.\" She grinned widely at him. \"Besides, what would I do without you during the night?\" She kissed him and lured him to bed. Their last day there, they got a visit from Vivaine and Merlin. \"Hello children.\" The kids ran out to greet their grandmother. She loved them so much. Merlin gave Xander a stone that shone brightly and Vivaine gave Helena a rose that was always glass but looked real. She told her she could see the future with it and to use it wisely. Xander's stone could make him invisible. The children were very happy. Vivaine and Morgaine went for a walk. \"So, do you want to leave your life here?\" Vivaine asked. \"No, not really.\" Morgaine replied. Then she began to cry. For no reason at all except for stress and the fact that she knew she would miss Avalon. She told Vivaine of her fears for her children out there, how she knew that Lancelot was right, but how she did not want her son to be a soldier. She cried because all the magic she had learned was going to most likely be of no use in the world of common man. She cried for many reasons, and she told Vivaine them all. And she loved Vivaine like her own mother, even coming to call her mother after her marriage to Lancelot. She wasso scared, and for the first time, she did not have an elder in her life to guide her. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK. ","Summary":" Note...In thisnversion, Lancelot and Morgaine get married.

This story is my way of imagining what could have happened ifnGwenhyfer (spelling?) and Lancelot had gotten together instead of hernmarrying Arthur. The story involves Gwenhyfer becoming a priestess and anwhole new set of conflicts to be resolved. So please enjoy and send menreviews. Oh yeah of course I do not own anything that has to do withnArthur, Camelot, or any of Marion Zimmer Bradley's ideas. \"Are you sure she can't see us?\" Lancelot asked Morgaine as he watched thenfair haired woman seem to stare through the fog. \"Of course not.\" Morgaine said and gave a small laugh at the thought thatna mere mortal would be able to make their way into Avalon. \"Could you part the fog?\" Lancelot asked with a trace of hope clinging tonhis voice. \"I would like to find out who she is.\" \"Oh very well, but I am only doing this because you are my family.\"nMorgaine said with an exasperated tone in her voice. Morgaine then stoodnup and raised her hands above her head and called upon the power of thenearth to move the veil that hid the ancient site known as Avalon. As shenslowly lowered her hands to her side the thick veil of fog was moved fromnwhere it hung, and created a sort of doorway between the two worlds. The woman gasped and was obviously frightened when she saw Lancelot andnMorgaine seemingly appear from nowhere out of thin air. \"What magic isnthis?\" She asked and held up the silver cross that hung around her neck. Lancelot held his hand up to her and gave her a smile that he hoped wouldncalm the fright that he could plainly see across her lovely features. Thisnyoung woman was the loveliest creature that Lancelot had ever seen andnsomehow knew that his destiny was somehow connected to the fair creature.n\"Do not be afraid, my name is Lancelot and this is my cousin Morgaine.\" \"You are one of the fairy creatures come to put a spell on me.\" The youngnwoman said on the verge of tears. \"We certainly are not.\" Lancelot said with a smile while Morgaine scoffednat how wrong the young woman was. \"What is you're name?\" \"I am Gwenhyfer, the daughter of King Lothos. But who are you if you arennot fairies?\" She answered back slowly becoming more comfortable with thenstrange woman and man that stood before her. \"Please where does that roadnlead to?\" Lancelot turned around to look at the path that he and Morgaine had run upnjust minutes before. \"That path leads to Avalon, where my mother and thenother prieststess' worship the great earth goddess. My mother Vivian isnthe lady of the lake, the head priestess, and Morgaine here is rumored tonbe the next in charge.\" Lancelot answered her and looked to her face tonsee the reaction he would see cross her face. \"I was told stories of the place called Avalon when I was a child in thenpalace. I was told it was a place full of tiny magical creatures that flynabout on the wings of the birds, and perform all sorts of magical rituals.\"n Gwenhyfer answered slowly growing confidence in the presence of thenspecial people in front of her. \"Well as you can see we are not tiny and definitely do not ride around thenbacks of the birds.\" Morgaine answered with a chuckle at the thought ofnthose loyal to the goddess as small as the clever little birds. \"As fornthe rituals, you were correct we have those that we do to honor thengoddess.\" \"If you are a princess what are you doing here at the monastery with thosenChristian monks?\" Lancelot asked hoping Gwenhyfer would say that she wasnat the monastery preparing to enter into a convent. The beauty that gracednher would be wasted in a place that he new encouraged leaving your worldlynpleasures behind. \"My father is away at battle, and has sent me to the monastery so that Incan study while he is away.\" She answered Lancelot while slowly comingncloser to where he and Morgaine were standing. \"You said the path leads tonAvalon, may I see it?\" Morgaine was about to close the veil when she felt the wind pick up allnaround her. She looked to her right and left and then finally understoodnwhat was causing the wind to pick up so much. In front of her a column ofnlight was spiraling and forming itself into the familiar sight of hernmentor Vivian. \"Wait Morgaine; do not close the veil yet.\" Vivian'snpowerful voice said as the column of light finally formed into thenobviously commanding figure of the lady of the lake. \"My dear Gwenhyfer,nyou have now come across a sacred place that normally you should not haveneven known was there at all.\" \"How do you know my name?\" Gwenhyfer asked very afraid of the tall womannwhose bright image was suspended in front of her. \"And what do you meannnormally?\" \"The truth is that I have been watching you for quite some time now. Innoticed that whenever you would be out in the forest you would be so atnpeace and comfortable with nature. Those are characteristics of thenpriestess that I wish to find in all those who come into the motherngoddesses' service. As for your ability to perform the magic rituals of anpriestess I believe those would come in time after you have been trained.\"nVivian said surprising all three people who stood in the presence of thengreat lady. \"You want me to become one of you?\" Gwehyfer asked astonished at what wasnbeing offered to her. \"How can you be sure that I am right to be anpriestess? I have never had anything magical happen to me!\" \"Whenever you would walk with the men from the monastery you seemed to knownthat there was something in the fog without being able to see it didn'tnyou? Those feelings are proof that you have the makings to be a woman ofnthe goddess.\" Vivian assured her. \"Now I will give you the choice, younmay come and join our order or return to the monastery.\" During the conversation Vivian was having with Gwenhyfer it was taking allnof Morgaine's control to not speak out against what Vivian was suggestingnto this girl. Morgaine knew that Vivian was wise and had her reasons forninviting Gwenhyfer to be a priestess, but she could not help but have a badnfeeling when she looked at the young woman who was obviously torn betweennreturning to her old life and venturing off into a new one. As she watchednwhat Gwenhyfer was going through, Morgaine realized that even though shenwas leery of this young woman she needed assurance that the worthiness ofnthe goddess was the right thing to strife for. \"I know you must benpositively torn trying to figure out what to do right now, so maybe I canntell you what a life dedicated to the goddess entails.\" Morgaine spoke upnsuddenly feeling compassionate about how she could help this young woman.n\"Your life would at times be hard but overall be very fulfilling. TO serventhe goddess makes you feel so complete you feel as if you were lost withoutnher. She fills you up with such a great feeling of wholeness that you willnfeel so wonderful you feel as if you could burst. So if you feel you canndedicate your life to the goddess I to invite you to come join our order.\" Gwenhyfer was grateful for Morgaine's encouraging words, but yet still didnnot know if she wanted to leave her whole life as she knew it behind. Shenlooked among the three faces that watched her, and her gaze came to rest onnLancelot. He had not stopped looking at her ever since his mother hadnsuggested she come to Avalon and Gwenhyfer knew that the attraction shenfelt for this man was one of the things that was pulling her in thendirection of the goddess. \"Will you be in Avalon?\" She timidly askednhoping that his mother would not see the desire that was building up fornher son. \"I do not live at Avalon, but I will come to visit you if that is what younwish.\" Lancelot replied happy that Gwenhyfer wanted to have him in hernlife. A smile immediately crossed Gwenhyfer's face when she heard Lancelot'snanswer to her question and then she knew that she could become a priestessnwith his support and encouragement. \"I would be happy to join your ordernmadam.\" She said and bowed to Vivian. \"You have made a great choice indeed, young one. I believe like Morgainenyou have great things in your future for you as well.\" Vivian replied withna smile. \"You may now come through the veil, but first you must get rid ofnthe trinket that if around your neck.\" Gwenhyfer looked down to the silver cross that hung around her neck andngently tossed it on the ground. She looked up to where Lancelot andnMorgaine were waiting for her, and with a smile stepped through the gatewaynto her new life.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two Authors Note: Well here is the second chapter to my story. Thank you tonthe person who told me the correct way to spell Gwenhwyfar's name, I reallynwouldn't have expected to spell it that way. I intended to already haventhe fertility festival done with but when I started to write this chapter,nI just completely changed my mind. I intend to actually have Arthur andnhis coronation in the next chapter, so if you are going through Arthurnwithdrawal, don't worry he is coming soon. Please send me reviews I reallyndo like getting them, they encourage me to write more. Chapter Two Goddess of the Earth and SkynWe honor you through all the days.nKeep us now in your sightnAnd always watch us sing your praise. This chant had become such a staple and fundamental part of Gwenhwyfar'snlife that she couldn't imagine her former life without the traditions shenhad come to love. Her day now consisted of the Morning Prayer, and herncontinuous study to become a priestess of Avalon. She had been studyingnfor about a year under Vivian and Morgaine's tutelage and had come tonregard both of them as family. It was this fact that made Gwenhwyfar worrynwhen she learned that Morgaine was chosen to be the virgin priestess of thenannual fertility rites. She had come to know Morgaine very well in thentime she was in Avalon and could see how nervous Morgaine was getting as itngot closer to the night of the ritual. Vivian also knew of the emotionsnthat were being tossed about inside of Morgaine, and the day beforenMorgaine was to leave sat down with the two young women to sooth theirndoubts. \"Gwenhwyfar, Morgaine I know you are both worried about the ritual that isncoming up, but I assure you there is nothing for you to worry about.nNothing will happen to Morgaine that has not been done in many rituals fornmany years.\" Vivian said as she sat talking to the two young women.n\"Don't you two trust me?\" \"Of course we trust you Vivian.\" Morgaine assured her. \"But couldn't yountell me what is going to happen. It may help me be not as nervous if Inknow what I am supposed to do.\" \"I do not know if it will help you, but I suppose you have the right tonknow what is going to happen. The day of the festival you will be washednclean and then covered in the ancient symbols all over your body. You willnbe painted with these symbols from your head all the way down to your toes,nand then given the ceremonial robe to wear. You then will be taken out ofnAvalon by the guards to the place where the ceremony will be taking place.nThere you will be blessed once more before being taken into a sacred cavenwhere you will wait for the hunter. He will hunt down a stag, and thennbring it to you as a gift. Then there in the cave you will lay with him,nand consummate your union.\" Vivian finished with a flat voice, waiting tonjudge the reaction she would see in Morgaine's face. \"I have to lay with the man.\" Morgaine asked with a timid voice. \"Whatnwill happen after the night is over.\" \"You will come back to Avalon, and never see the man again. You are meantnto only know him for one night, and then you are to come back and help menofficiate over a celebration.\" Vivian said in reply to Morgaine'snquestion. \"What kind of celebration?\" \"A celebration of marriage among the priestesses.\" Vivian said with antrace of a smile across her face. \"Marriage!\" Gwenhwyfar gasped. \"I thought you said that the priestessesnof Avalon never marry ------- \"Except in unique circumstances.\" Vivian inturupted. \"Now Gwenhwyfar donyou admit that you have certain feelings for my son?\" \"Well my lady I guess I do admire him greatly and enjoy his company.\"nGwenhwyfar said suddenly embarrassed and afraid of where the conversationnwas going. \"Is there a specific reason why you need to know my feelingsntoward your son?\" \"Well it is good that you admire him, because I have come to regard you asnpart of my family and would not want you to be in an unhappy marriage.\"nVivian said with a smile. \"Wait Gwenhwyfar is the one getting married?!\" Morgaine said with purenexcitement laced within her voice. \"Yes. Merlin and I have had a discussion and have decided that you willnmarry Lancelot. We have both foreseen the future and know that if you donnot marry him there will be great trouble within our families.\" Viviannsaid and looked at both Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar as she said this. \"What kind of trouble? Will something happen to Arthur?\" Morgaine askednsuddenly worried about her younger brother. \"Do not worry my darling; Arthur is fine he is studying with Merlin rightnnow. The only thing you need to concentrate on now is the ritual, and thenncelebrating my son's marriage.\" Vivian assured Morgaine in her strong yetnsoothing voice. \"And you Gwenhwyfar, you must now go to prepare yourselfnfor your marriage and your husbands arrival.\" \"Does Lancelot know of your plans Vivian?\" Gwenhwyfar asked. \"He has been summoned to Avalon, but does not know why. I will tell himnwhen he arrives, and if I know my son fairly well enough, he will be morenthan willing to marry you. Now I have some things to do before tomorrow,nso I want you two to go off and do not worry about anything.\" Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar watched Vivian walk away down the path to her roomnand then made their way down to their own rooms. \"Are you nervousnanymore?\" Gwenhwyfar asked as they walked down to where the priestessesnslept. The question caught Morgaine off guard and she knew that Gwenhwyfar knewnMorgaine to well to lie. \"Honestly I think I am more nervous than I wasnbefore. Before I knew what I had to do, I was just afraid of what Inpossibly might have to do. But now that I know what I exactly have to do Infeel as if I am going to fall apart at any second.\" \"Well think of it this way, you will not be committed to this man after thenone night. When I marry Lancelot, I will always be his and will have to gonwherever he goes.\" Gwenhwyfar stated. \"I thought you wanted to marry Lancelot, and were happy that this hadnhappened. You cannot deny the feelings you have for each other; they arenclearly seen across both your faces whenever he comes to Avalon.\" Morgainenteased Gwenhwyfar. \"Oh I do want to marry Lancelot, and I admit I have strong feelings fornhim. But I do not wish to lose who I am once I marry him.\" Gwenhwyfarnexclaimed. \"What do you mean lose who you are?\" \"When we get married Lancelot will not live here and I will have to follownhim leaving the place that I have come to know as home. I do not wish tonbecome just another trophy wife that sits at her husband's feet.\" \"Oh Gwenhwyfar! I am sure that that would never happen. I know Viviannvery well, and I am sure she would never agree to the marriage if she didnnot believe that you would be able to take care of yourself.\" Morgainenexclaimed. \"You really think so?\" \"Yes I am truly sure. Vivian is wise in ways that even I cannotncomprehend, and I am sure that they she would not approve the marriage ifnshe doesn't believe in it. Do not worry.\" Morgaine then said with ansmirk. \"I think the only thing you have to worry about now is how tonsatisfy Lancelot.\" Gwenhwyfar gasped and playfully hit her friend turning away so thatnMorgaine would not see the blush that was on her face. She tried to keep anstraight face but couldn't help laughing at Morgaine's remark. \"Well Inguess I will just have to try my best and maybe I can invent somethingnnew.\" She shot back and turned to look at the reaction she would get fromnMorgaine. They just laughed together and kept walking to their rooms.nWhen they reached their separate sleeping areas, they gave each other onenmore hug and went of their separate ways to try and get some sleep beforenthey went onto their new paths of life. Well there is chapter two I really hope you like it. Please send menreviews I really do like getting them no matter if they are good or bad.nThanks, and have a good day!!![Chapter 3] Authors Note: Hi sorrynI haven't updated in along time. I have been busy with lots ofnthings like vacation, school, and writing other stories. So anywaynplease send me more reviews, I really like getting them. Pleasenenjoy my story and have a nice day! The next morningnGwenhwyfar woke up and immediately remembered how important the daynwas for both Morgaine and herself. Today was the day Morgaine wouldnleave to participate in the Beltane Rites, and Gwenhwyfar was to seenher future husband. She got up from her bed very nervous about whatnshe would say to Lancelot when he first heard he was to marry her. nShe was still trying to formulate an intelligent conversation whennshe bumped into another person who was leaving the sleeping quarters.n \"Oh I'm sorry!\" She apologized and looked up to see who shenhad run into. Gwenhwyfar was greetednwith the pale face and uncommonly quiet figure of Morgaine walkingndown the hallway. She looked completely disheveled and unaware ofnwhat she was doing. Gwenhwyfar heard her mumble something liken\"that's ok\", and watched as Morgaine continued down thenhallway. After watching Morgaine for a second, Gwenhwyfar quicklynran to catch up with her and gently asked \"How are you doing todaynMorgaine?\" It was at that pointnthat Morgaine finally looked up and seemed to wake from her daze whennshe realized who was talking to her. \"Oh hello, I am fine.\" Shenquickly answered and returned her gaze to the path in front of her. \"Ok Morgaine I knownyou well enough to know when you are not telling the truth. Now tellnme what you really want to say. Tell me what you are honestlynfeeling.\" Morgaine looked over tonher friend and could see the genuine concern that was draped acrossnher face. \"Honestly... I am terrified about what is going tonhappen to me tonight. I don't think I can do it.\" Gwenhwyfar didn'tnknow what to say and was afraid her silence would worry Morgaine evennmore. \"Well let me ask you this, what is it that you are mostnworried about?\" \"I don't know. Inthink it is the fact that this will be the first time doing, well younknow what!\" \"Morgaine, I'm surenevery woman in the world gets nervous the first time they sleep withna man, the goddess knows I am worried about what will happen whennLancelot comes to Avalon.\" Gwenhwyfar said with a soft blushncreeping across her face. \"Like I said yesterday, I don't thinknVivian would send you to the Beltane Rites if she didn't think youncould handle it. You just have to go in there and face your fears,nand have a little fun while you are at it.\" She finished with anmischievous expression on her face and an arch of her eyebrows. nMorgaine looked at her friends face and found the courage that hadnflown from her body. She laughed and even though she still feltnnervous, she knew she would be all right. They were still laughingnwhen Vivian met them on the path to the dining hut. \"Morgaine it isntime.\" She said in her rich commanding voice. Gwenhwyfar andnMorgaine's laughter immediately stopped when they heard Vivian'snstatement. They looked at each other and then looked at Vivian. Shenwas watching them both with a sort of half smile, but yet she stillnhad a rather serious demeanor surrounding her. Morgaine took a deepnbreath and with one last look around her she walked toward Vivian andnasked \"ok, what happens first?\" \"You will go to thenpreparation hut and there you will be washed and painted. Then younwill leave on the launch with the guards and go to the ceremony.\" nVivian calmly explained. \"Gwenhwyfar you will go with me now tonbring Lancelot to Avalon.\" \"Lancelot is here?!\"n Gwenhwyfar exclaimed once again filled with the nerves that hadnescaped her body during her talk with Morgaine. \"Yes he arrived justna few minutes ago. We will go get him from the shore and then wenwill tell him of your impending marriage.\" \"You are not going tonsee me off?\" Morgaine said feeling as though she was about to cry. \"Do not worry myndear; your preparation will take a few hours. I will be throughntalking to Lancelot and Gwenhwyfar in plenty of time to see you off.\"n Vivian said and gave Morgaine's hands a gentle squeeze. \"Nowngo, I will see you soon.\" \"Yes Aunt.\" nMorgaine replied and with her head held high marched up the path. nWhile she knew she seemed like she was putting on a brave front,ninside her stomach was doing flip flops. \"All right Gwenhwyfarnlet us not keep Lancelot waiting.\" Vivian said as she watchednMorgaine walk away. \"Vivian I justnremembered something that I wanted to ask you. I know you told menthat Lancelot and I will be married here at Avalon, but what willnhappen during the ceremony? I have only attended Christian weddings,nnever one where the couple followed the ways of the goddess.\" nGwenhwyfar said as they walked along the dock where the launch waitednfor them. \"In the marriagenceremony, you and Lancelot will be dressed in new robes and taken upnto the circle where you first met. There Merlin and myself willnbless your union, and fasten a rope around your joined hands. Afternthe rope is fastened and you are once again blessed, your union willnbe complete.\" \"Is that all?!\" nGwenhwyfar exclaimed amazed at how simple the whole ceremony wouldnbe. She had expected the ritual to be as involved, if not more, thanna Christian wedding ceremony. \"Yes, what did younexpect? Slitting your wrists to join you blood? We are not thentotal barbarians the Christians think we are.\" Vivian answerednback with a small smile. \"Like I told Morgaine, you will be ablento do this. You are stronger than you think. Plus I know Lancelotnis considered a mighty warrior and knight, but I know my son and henis not as fierce as people make him out to be. Now say hello to yournfuture husband.\" She completed as the launch landed on the shore. \"Hello mother, what'snthis about somebody being a husband?\" Lancelot asked as he steppednonto the launch. \"You will find outnsoon enough my son. It is good to see you again.\" \"It is good to seenyou too mother, and you Gwenhwyfar. Have they been treating younkindly here at Avalon?\" \"I am perfectly happynhere.\" Gwenhwyfar assured him. She was so nervous being near himnthat she had to lower her head to keep him from seeing the blush thatnshe could feel crossing her features. \"Thank you for your kindnconcern.\" \"It is my pleasure.\"n Lancelot replied with his eyes on Gwenhwyfar. He would have beenncontent to watch her all day if he hadn't been aware of his mothernstanding right next to him. \"And where is my cousin Morgaine, Inthought for sure she would be with you to greet me.\" \"Morgaine is gettingnready for the Beltane Rites.\" Vivian briskly answered as thenlaunch hit the shore and she stepped onto the land. \"The Beltane Rites! nWhy would subject her to that?\" Lancelot was completely shocked atnwhat Morgaine was participating in. \"Mother you always told me thenBeltane Rites was a very complicated and emotional ritual thatnpriestesses never take part in.\" \"That is true, I didntell you that.\" Vivian said not looking at her son and Gwenhwyfarnas they walked to her chambers. \"But I have my reasons for sendingnMorgaine, and that is the end of it.\" She finished with a warningntone in her voice that told Lancelot he should drop the subject. n\"Now I want you to sit at the table with Gwenhwyfar, I havensomething I need to tell you.\" \"Yes mother.\" nLancelot answered as he and Gwenhwyfar sat down at the table in thenmiddle of the room. \"Now Lancelot, younknow that I summoned you to come Avalon but you do not know why. Thenfact of the matter is I want you to carry on the family line. So Inhave decided you are to marry one of the priestesses of Avalon.\" Gwenhwyfar waited fornLancelot's reaction expecting him to be outraged, but was surprisednwhen Lancelot calmly asked \"You want me to marry?\" \"That is correct. Inhave heard or seen nothing of you settling down with a young woman,nand so I have taken it upon myself to find you a wife that I knownwill be your equal.\" Vivian answered in her strong commandingnvoice. \"All right mothernbefore I get really mad, may I ask who is it that you expect me tonmarry? Is it someone I know or is it one of the priestess that Inhave never met before.\" \"No you know yournbetrothed. In fact she is sitting right next to you now.\" Gwenhwyfar heartnstopped pumping for a few seconds when she heard Vivian say her name.n She knew that now was the pivotal moment in which she would knownwhether Lancelot would be happy about marrying her or not. Shenslowly looked up at Lancelot's face and was surprised to see himnstaring at her. \"Mother......\" Lancelot started to speak stillnstaring at Gwenhwyfar, but couldn't seem to get any words out ofnhis mouth. \"I will leave you twonalone to talk. I have to go check on Morgaine's progress. Shensaid breaking the silence that had fallen across the hut. \"I willnbe back soon.\" She stated as she walked away out of her quarters. Lancelot and Gwenhwyfarnsat in a silence that seemed to fill the whole hut for a whole minutenbefore either of them said anything. Even when Lancelot finallynspoke up, his voice was not its usual strong baritone, and was morenlike a young child struggling to breath. \"So you and I are to benmarried.\" He said trying not sound like a bigger man than he wasnreally feeling at the moment. \"Yes.\" Gwenhwyfarnshortly answered, afraid to say anything that might upset him. \"Now I could benwrong, but you don't seem especially surprised at my Mother'snannouncement. Did you know about this?\" Lancelot asked as henpaced around the table. \"Yes.\" \"Really!\" Lancelotnsaid surprised that Gwenhwyfar actually knew about his mother'sndecision. \"How long have you known?\" \"I just found outnyesterday actually. Believe me it was as much a shock to me as I cannsee on your face when I first found out.\" Gwenhwyfar answered in anquiet voice. \"No I am not innshock. I just am very surprised.\" Lancelot assured Gwenhwyfar. n\"I will tell you the truth though. I did not expect to get marriednanytime soon.\" \"Ever since I enterednthe service of the goddess, I did not expect to get married at all.\"n Gwenhwyfar said as slowly gained more confidence. She knew thatnthese moments now were pivotal and chose her next words veryncarefully. \"If you want the truth from me, at first I was verynshocked and scared to marry you. But I know that I have specialnfeelings for you, and I will be very happy to marry you.\" Shenwatched Lancelot's face to see his reaction to her answer, and wasnsurprised when he just looked at her and then sat back down at thentable. \"You have only knownnfor one day? I am surprised, I would have thought my mother wouldnhave told you and kept you waiting for at least a week.\" Lancelotnsaid surprised. \"I will understand ifnyou do not want to marry me. I just want you to know that I admirenyou greatly, and would be happy as your wife.\" Gwenhwyfar shylynsaid and waited for Lancelot's answer. Lancelot sat looking atnGwenhwyfar for a few seconds before he spoke. It was in those fewnmoments that he realized how much he really liked the beautiful womennsitting in front of him. \"Well, if you do not object, I would benhappy to marry you to.\" He stated with a smile. \"Really?! Please donnot marry me just because your mother tells you to. I have nevernliked the idea that my father would have made an arranged marriagenfor me if I had not joined the order, and I would not want to getnmarried if you did not want me.\" \"No Gwenhwyfar. Evernsince I first saw you I have had feelings for you.\" He assured hernas he moved closer to where she sat at the dining table. \"I knownnow that those feelings have grown to love and I do not think I couldnbe happy marrying anyone but you.\" Lancelot then took Gwenhwyfar'snhand and placed a very gentle kiss upon the top of her hand that shenknew showed truly how much he loved her. It was just then thatnVivian returned, walking silently into the hut. \"So is everythingngoing all right in here?\" She asked when she walked into the hut. \"Everything is finenmother.\" Lancelot answered her. \"How is Morgainendoing Vivian? I know she was nervous this morning.\" Gwenhwyfarnasked. \"She is preparingnwell. I have come to get the both of you to see her off. She willnbe leaving for the ceremony soon.\" \"Yes Vivian. We willncome to see her off directly.\" Gwenhwyfar said as she stood. Theynthen walked back to the dock silent as they slowly trudged along thenpath. Gwenhwyfar and Lancelot kept stealing little glances at eachnother as they walked. Vivian could tell that her son and the youngnpriestess had changed. She could feel the love that had started tonradiate off of the two young people, and assumed that she would notnhave to convince them that their union would be a wise event. When they finally madenit to the dock, they all found Morgaine waiting. She was sitting onna chair on the launch with a wooden mask on her head and a cloaknwrapped around her. She was clutching the thick cloth around hernlike it was a safety blanket that would protect her from what was toncome. \"Morgaine, be safe and make us proud. May the goddess watchnover you.\" Vivian blessed Morgaine as the Avalon guards took theirnplaces around the young priestess and pushed the launch away from thendock. As Morgaine watched thenshore slowly become obscured by the mist, she knew that now she wasnon her own. She knew she would have to trust her own instincts, andnthat a new time in her life was starting. A time that would surelynbring new joys, new sorrows, new hardships, and new events toncomplicate her life. So that's it fornthis chapter, please send me reviews and venture over to read mynother stories! Have a nice day!!![Chapter 4] Chapter Four Author's Note: Hey Inhave finally updated again. I am sorry I have not done it in sonlong. I have no excuse I am just lazy. Also I noticed that Inchanged a few things from chapter three so that those details do notnadd up with what I put in chapter four. Please don't be mad I likenwhat I thought up four chapter four better, and like I said I'mnlazy! Please enjoy, and have a nice day! Chapter Four Morgaine sat on thenlaunch and noticed that her heart had started to speed up. It nonlonger was in sink with the gentle rhythm that was created by thenguards steady rowing. The guards were silent as the launch hit thenshore, and it was then that Morgaine saw them. There were peoplenlined up along a path lit by torches, and they were all looking atnher. Their stares bore all the way into her bones and made a chillnrun all the way down her spine. Morgaine knew there wasnno chance for her to turn back now, so she took a very hesitant stepnforward and was immediately flanked by the women who would helpnprepare her for the ceremony. Morgaine started to walk down thenpathway and the drums started their rhythmic pattern. At first itnwas simple, but steadily it grew louder and more intricate thenfarther she stepped down the path. Then she saw him, thenhunter. He was standing upon the hill that rose above the pathwayndressed in animal hide clothes and a wooden mask that was similar tonMorgaine's own. She stopped when she saw him and they both lookednat each other. Then suddenly he was gone, running down the hill withntwo guards following close behind. Morgaine watched him go and thennfelt the women that were gathered around her gently push towards thencave that was waiting at the end of the trail. She walked throughnthe large opening and then she saw what she truthfully had hopednwould not be in the cave. A large bed sat upnagainst the center wall of the cave. It was covered in all sorts ofnblankets and animal hides that provided ample cushion and made thenbed seem even larger than it already was. Morgaine walked towardsnthe bed and took off the cloak that was wrapped around her body likena second skin. The women beckoned for her to get on the bed and turnnaround to face the entrance so she could greet the hunter. After shensat down the women arranged her thin gown and used a special incensento anoint the bed before they left her alone. Morgaine knew this wasnto make sure the night would go smoothly and correctly, but shensecretly wished things would go wrong. She was now more terrifiednthan she had ever been in her whole life. The drums started theirnfaster beat and that's when she saw him. He walked through thenentrance like a wolf stalking his prey and stared at Morgainenchilling her all the way down to her bones. When he started to walkntowards the bed, all Morgaine could do to try and protect herself wasnpull the animal hide coverings up closer to her chin. It was annaction that was hindered by the hunter's strength, as he pulled innthe other direction. As Morgaine pulled the covers higher she couldnfeel them being ripped from her hands by the man who was now at thenfoot of the bed. She tried to keep the hides over herself, but hernstrength was no match for his. He steadily pulled the covers offnMorgaine and started to crawl over her pining her down into the bed. nMorgaine knew it was impossible to see the man's face with thenwooden mask covering it, but for some reason the hunter seemed verynfamiliar. Morgaine was trying to figure out who the man could be butnwas distracted by his hand trailing up his thigh. The intensenfeelings he was causing in her were something that she had never feltnbefore. Her body felt so alive when the hunter caressed her, and allnshe could think of was getting as close as possible to the mysteriousnman who was causing such wonderful feelings in her body. Before shenknew it the hunter had pulled her dress up around her waist and wasnleaning into her. Morgaine wanted to protest, but her words werenshattered when he entered her. She felt do alive and knew that anportion of her life was starting that she would not be able to turnnback on. The rest of the night was a blur for Morgaine. She knewnall the feelings the hunter was pulling forth from her had to meannsomething, but yet she knew they couldn't come forth. After thenritual was done in the morning, Morgaine would likely never see thenmasked man who had made her feel so good again. The next morningnMorgaine woke up early and remembered what had happened the nightnbefore. She heard a sigh and looked to the other side of the bed andnsaw that the hunter was still slumbering peacefully next to her. Shenwatched the man slowly breathe in and out for a few seconds and wasntempted to lift his wooden mask off his face to get a better look atnhim. It was amazing that all through the night, not only his mask,nbut her own to had stayed on. Morgaine knew she was supposed tonleave the mask on all night, but she had expected the tie to comenapart at some point. She was reaching over to push the wooden masknoff of the hunter's face when the women who had blessed her lastnnight came to the entrance of the cave. They walked silently andnsaid nothing to Morgaine. But Morgaine knew they were coming tonretrieve her, to escort her back to the guards of Avalon. Morgainentook one last look at the sleeping man beside her and then got upnfrom the bed. She adjusted her robes,nand walked out by the women who were waiting for her. They watchednher with eyes that seemed to pierce into her very soul, but Morgainenheld her head high and strong. She was a priestess of Avalon, one ofnthose chosen to serve the mother goddess; she had to stay strong innfront of the women. She walked on down the path to where the guardsnsilently stood waiting for her on the shore line. When she sat downnonce again in the chair on the raft, she finally relaxed after beingnwatched by so many people. She thought back aboutnwhat had happened to her the night before and only then removed thenwooden mask from her face. She was trying to imagine who the hunterncould have been, and knew that at one time she would have wished henwould have been Lancelot. When she had first met Lancelot two yearsnearlier, she had felt an attraction that she knew only went one way. nThat attraction was still present in her, but she knew it did notnburn as brightly as it had a year ago. Morgaine supposed that thatnwas a good thing considering Lancelot was to marry Gwenhwyfar in thenmorning. She had thought that she would be bothered by the weddingnand the two lovers' obvious affection for each other for a longntime. But the Beltane rite's had done something to her, it hadnchanged her in some way. She felt different. I guess you could saynshe felt more alive and wiser to the world. She was happy fornLancelot and Gwenhwyfar, and she would not do anything to try andnruin their day. She was brought out of her musings as the launch hitnthe shores of Avalon and she was greeted by Vivian. \"Hello my child, maynblessings of the goddess be upon you.\" \"Good morning Vivian,nmay the blessings of the mother goddess be upon you.\" Morgainenresponded and bowed her head in acknowledgement to her mentor. \"I trust your nightnwas a success?\" Vivian asked as she started to walk down the pathnthat lead into the heart of Avalon. Morgaine was a littlensurprised and confused by Vivian's question. She didn'tnunderstand what else was supposed to happen other than her night withnthe hunter. Morgaine probably should have been suspicious of whatnVivian was asking but only looked at her aunt closely beforenresponding to her question. \"Everything went fine Vivian; I believenthe ritual was a success.\" \"Good.\" Was allnVivian said in reply and once again threaded the needle of suspicionnin Morgaine's head. She was about to ask Vivian of there wasnanything she needed to say when she heard her name being callednthrough the fog that was obscuring the path around Avalon. \"Morgaine, welcomenback.\" Gwenhwyfar called out as she walked down the path withnLancelot. \"How was your night?\" \"It was fine thanknyou.\" \"Morgaine had a verynproductive night, but now it is time to get you ready Gwenhwyfar.\" nVivian interrupted before Morgaine could say anything else. n\"Lancelot you shall come with me, while Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar gondown to the priestess chambers. You two will meet Raven in thenbathing hut and she will know how to take care of you two.\" Viviannsaid with a look on her face that clearly expressed how she no longernwanted the conversation to continue. \"We will see you again whennthe sun is high.\" She finished and started to walk off in thenopposite direction. Lancelot turned to takenone last second to talk to Gwenhwyfar and Morgaine but didn't get anchance when he heard Vivian calling him from down the path. \"Comennow Lancelot, we do not have much time.\" Even far off down thenpath, Vivian's voice was as strong and commanding as ever. \"Well Morgaine, nownthat Vivian is gone, tell me the truth how was last night?\" nGwenhwyfar asked as she steered Morgaine down the path towards thencleansing hut. \"I was scared tondeath. I was lead to the cave, and the hunter came like Vivian said,nand then … well you know what happened next.\" Morgaine answerednsheepishly. She could feel the blush coming across her face andnlowered her head to hide the emotions crawling across her face. \"Yes, of course Inknow what happened last night, but I'm the novice one here now,nwhat was it like?\" \"It hurt when henfirst started to go in but then I don't know how to describe it, itnfelt so different. It felt good, like I was exploring new parts ofnmyself.\" Morgaine sighed. \"This is so embarrassing; I can'tnbelieve I am talking about this.\" \"No you have nothingnto be embarrassed about. From what I remember hearing in my father'sncourt, men talk about their sexual conquests just as much if not morenthan women do.\" Gwenhwyfar said and laughed at her joke. \"WhennI was little I remember listening to the guards and noblemen of mynfather's court. There were two things they loved to boast about,nhunting and their sexual appetite.\" \"Well I you what itnwas like.\" Morgaine said with a smile across her face. \"And wenshould concentrate on you now. Are you excited for today?\" \"Oh yes. I honestlyndo not know what kind of wife I will make for Lancelot though. Inhave become so used to the ways of the goddess, that I am rusty onnthe ways to be a proper wife.\" \"Oh I am sure oncenyou resume your duties outside of Avalon; they will come back tonyou.\" Morgaine guaranteed the nervous woman who walked at hernside. \"Gwenhwyfar, I need to say something to you and if I don'tnI feel like am not being honest with you.\" \"Morgaine whatever isnthe matter; you look as though you are going to be ill?\" nGwenhwyfar asked turning toward Morgaine with concern draped acrossnher face. \"Gwenhwyfar I wantnyou to be honest with you because you have become like a sister tonme, and soon you will officially be a part of my family. I want tontell you how I feel about Lancelot. For along time I was in lovenwith him. He seemed so perfect and was so handsome, I think I fellnlove with him on the inside but hid it from everyone.\" Morgainencontinued hardly daring to lift her face which was now staring downnat the ground. \"Morgaine I really donnot know what to say, I did not expect this at all.\" \"I know you did not,nand I fell terrible for bringing it up on your wedding day, but Infelt I needed to get it off of my conscience. I also wanted to tellnyou that I know that my feelings have changed. I would not have beennable to go through with last night f they had not changed. Do younhate me?\" \"No I do not hatenyou, I just am surprised. I did not expect this.\" Gwenhwyfarnanswered and then was silent for a few moments. \"Morgaine I cannunderstand you having feelings for Lancelot, and I thank you fornbeing honest with me. Now we should not feel uncomfortable and talknabout things that would vex us. I am getting married today and Inwould not want us to go through with the ceremony having ill feelingsntowards each other.\" \"You are too kind anperson, you put me to shame.\" Morgaine beamed as they finallynreached the bathing hut where Raven, Vivian's trusted servant,nwaited for them. Four hours laternMorgaine and Gwenhwyfar exited from the hut that they had been coopednup in for the whole morning. Morgaine had been washed of all of thenpatterns that had been painted on her body for the Beltane Rite'snand had once again dressed in the traditional robes the priestessesnof Avalon wore to do their duties. Gwenhwyfar had also been washed,nbut afterwards was dressed in the softest white garment she had evernfelt. Flowers were strewn through her hair which had been curled andnleft to flow down her back. \"Gwenhwyfar you look beautiful!\" nMorgaine exclaimed when she finally saw Gwenhwyfar again. \"Lancelotnis sure to go blind from the beauty that is radiating off of you.\" \"Thank you Morgaine,nI fell beautiful.\" \"But wait you arenmissing one thing. There.\" Morgaine said and placed a wreath ofnwoven wildflowers onto Gwenhwyfar's head. \"Now we don't wantnto keep your bridegroom waiting.\" \"Thank you Morgaine,nyes let us go.\" Gwenhwyfar said and was beaming as she walked tonthe top off the hill where she had taken her first step into her lifenin Avalon and had first seen Lancelot. She had climbed this hillnmany times since she had become a priestess, but never had she feltnsuch apprehension or nervousness as she did while she steadily madenher way up. She knew she was happy, and could not understand why shenfelt so nervous at the moment. Then she saw him. nLancelot was waiting for her at the top of the hill, and just as shenhad been dressed up, so had he. He was wearing a suit of fine newnclothes and a breastplate that gleamed from the sun that was beatingndown from high above their heads. It seemed strange to Gwenhwyfarnthat Lancelot should be dressed up in full military regalia for hisnwedding, but he did look extremely dashing in his armor. \"Sisters we arengathered here today to join two who serve the mother goddess. Mayntheir union be a good event in a world that is full of hardship andnunrest.\" Vivian's words broke Gwenhwyfar from her thoughts andnsignaled that she should take her place across from Lancelot. \"Wenask the mother goddess to bless this man and this woman and join themntogether at this day and time.\" Vivian turned and took a smallnknife and a white silk rope from the young priestess who was holdingnthe blest items on a clean white towel draped across her arms. \"We use this daggernto join the two bloods to become one and join them with the ropes ofnlife. Gwenhwyfar, Lancelot, hold out your right hands.\" Viviannthen walked over and made a small slit across each of the right handsnthat were held out to her. She then pushed them together so that thentwo wounds that now had blood trickling down from the cuts werenconnected. \"Blood to blood, we join these beings and bind them fornall time.\" She finished and then wrapped the rope around the twonclasped hands. Gwenhwyfar heardnVivian's words and looked up to Lancelot. He was looking at her,nand his face was plastered with a huge smile that seemed to spreadnfrom ear to ear. I t was then that the wind picked up and Gwenhwyfarnnoticed that all around the people on the hill everything was moving. The leaves and bladesnof grass were billowing all over the place and seemed to be dancingnpatterns on the ground and all through the sky. The wind that wasnnormally a gentle breeze cooling your face as you looked out over thenwater that surrounded Avalon was now blowing widely all over thenplace. I furrowed through Gwenhwyfar's hair and seemed to fill himnwith a new spirit. Then it died down. Thenwind returned to its normal gentle breeze and the leaves and bladesnof grass returned to being still members of the earth. \"NownLancelot, you must leave us and go to Arthur at Camelot. The Saxons'nare attacking and he will need your fighting skills to roust themnfrom the land.\" \"Leave! No!\" nLancelot and Gwenhwyfar both exclaimed at the same time. \"Youncannot be serious Mother.\" \"I know you two wantnto spend some time alone together, but Arthur needs you Lancelot.\" \"Surly I could justnstay tonight and leave...\" \"No. It is out ofnthe question, you must leave immediately. After the fighting is overnand Camelot is secure I will send Gwenhwyfar and Morgaine for thencoronation.\" Vivian commanded. \"Now go.\" Lancelot knew not tonsecond guess his mother's orders and after a few seconds turned andngrabbed Gwenhwyfar's hand. \"Come now my dear, see me off.\" Hentensely said and started the trek down to the dock. After they werenabout halfway down the long hill, Lancelot had cooled off a bit andnbroke the tense silence by saying, \"You know this is not exactlynhow I imagined my wedding night would go.\" Gwenhwyfar couldn'tnhelp but smile at her husband's confession, and was relieved thatnhis anger towards his mother had not lasted very long. She knew thatnthey did not always have the best relationship, and wanted her familynto get along with each other. She had seen and heard of kingdoms andnfamilies that were torn apart by bitter quarrels and were nevernbrought together again. \"How long do you think it will be beforenwe may come to Camelot to see you?\" Gwenhwyfar could remember allnthe times her father went away to fight in battles or fornnegotiations with other kingdoms. He would be gone for months at antime and she always missed him terribly. \"Hopefully not long. nWhen Arthur and Morgaine were taken as children, Arthur was sent tonbe taught by Merlin. As well as being a powerful wizard, he is alsona skilled fighter. I'm sure Arthur has been trained well, and wenwill have ousted the Saxons in no time.\" Lancelot answerednGwenhwyfar as they reached the docks where the guards were waiting tonescort him to shore. \"All right I will se you soon.\" Gwenhwyfar looked aynher husband and realized that they had not kissed once ever sincenthey had been married let alone known each other. Lancelot wasnalready stepping onto the launch when Gwenhwyfar called out to him,n\"Lancelot wait. I forgot I wanted to tell you something.\" \"What?\" He askednand stepped back to where his wife was standing.\" \"This.\" She calmlynsaid and then reached up and connected their mouths for the firstntime. The only way to describe the kiss was magical. As soon asntheir lips had touched, Gwenhwyfar had felt a sparks go all the waynthrough her body making her feel like she was on fire. \"It justnoccurred to me that we have never done that before.\" She saidnafter they finally parted from each other. \"How am I going tonleave you now after a kiss like that?\" Lancelot murmured as henrested his forehead against Gwenhwyfar's. Then with one last looknand placing a kiss on his wife's hand he stepped onto the launchnand watched as the shore became farther and farther away. He knew nonmatter what happened he would see his wife again and hopefully soon.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five Author's Note: Hey everyone who isrnreading my story, sorry I did not update for such a long time but Irnhave been working my butt off to buy a car. I finally got one yea!rnOk I posted this chapter before I left on vacation, but I readrnit over when I got back and saw some typos. So I fixed those andrnreposted! I hope you keep reading my story, and I will try to postrnanother chapter soon. Have a great day! Chapter Five Lancelot rode for threerndays before he reached his destination. By then Arthur had oustedrnthe Saxons and had taken control of the mighty fortress that wasrnCamelot. The previous atmosphere that was full of fear and despairrnwas now one of celebration. Arthur had managed to once again turnrnthe old castle into a magnificent symbol of power. It was arncelebration of a new era and the start of Arthur's reign thatrnLancelot rode in on. There were still signsrnthat a battle had taken place, but the people who had survived didrnnot let those reminders deter them from having a good time. Theyrnsimply danced over the slain bodies of the Saxons', and rejoicedrnamong the burnt out buildings. Arthur was drinking with his knightsrnwhen Lancelot presented himself. \"My Lord, I am Lancelot sent byrnthe Lady of the Lake to aid you in the battle against the Saxons. Itrnseems that I was a little late.\" He declared and bent his head andrnshoulders in acknowledgment. \"Well Lancelot, whyrndoes my aunt think that you would be a good member of my court?\"rnArthur asked as the men around him quieted down. \"My dear Mother sentrnme, which should be proof enough. True she has not always been thernbest parent, but the fact that she is a powerful woman who should notrnbe crossed should be enough for you.\" Lancelot knew that his wordsrncould be construed as a threat, but he wanted everyone to know thatrnhe was a serious man and not just a favored son. \"Well if the mostrnhigh priestess of Avalon deems you worthy then I suppose I shouldrntrust your judgment dear cousin. But first, since we didn't get tornsee you fight in the battle, I will have you sport with three of myrnknights. Accolon, Percival, and Galahad one at a time you will facernhim. If you weapon is knocked from your hands or you yourself arernknocked down you are through. Now fight!\" Arthur commanded andrnsat back on his throne to watch his cousin fight. He had no doubt ofrnLancelot's abilities, but knew in order to remain in charge herncould not have favorites among his men even if they were relations. Lancelot saw the firstrnman come at him and at once saw his weakness. Accolon as he wasrncalled put all his power into his arms. He stayed in one place onlyrnmoving his legs to rotate his body to face his foe. Lancelot knewrnexactly what to do with him. He thrust forward causing Accolon tornstumble backwards while Lancelot knocked his sword from his hands.rnThe next knight, Percival did not hold his ground like Accolon did.rnHe continuously moved in a circle never giving Lancelot a clear shot.rn But then he saw it, Percival repeated the same pattern over and overrnagain. Three steps left and then five right. He went slow enoughrnthat Lancelot did not notice at first. But then he saw it andrnquickly dispatched Percival's sword by going the oppositerndirection. His reverse steps threw of Percival's concentration andrnleft Lancelot free to fight his last opponent. Galahad came atrnLancelot though full swinging. He swung his sword over and over, andrnwas blocked each time by Lancelot. The crowd cheered asrnthe swords clashed and groans from the two battling men resoundedrnacross the courtyard. Then it was over. With one quick swingrnLancelot knocked Galahad's sword from his hands and he had won.rnThe crowd cheered and Lancelot looked around to see Arthur raisingrnhis goblet in salute. \"Well done cousin,rnyou have proven yourself worthy. Come let us welcome our new brotherrnin celebration.\" Arthur proclaimed and the crowd cheered. The next two weeks werernspent cleaning and repairing the grounds in and around Camelot, andrnpreparing for Arthur's coronation. The mornings were spent fixingrnall the damage done by the Saxons, then the afternoon and night wasrnfull of celebration. The knights performed many feats of sport forrnthe court, the women danced, and the court jester performed feats torndazzle the crowd. It was one of these celebrations that Morgaine andrnGwenhwyfar came across one month later. They were riding with theirrntwo guards from Avalon when they heard the merrymaking a mile away.rn\"It seems that my dear brother has made Camelot glorious oncernagain.\" Morgaine said and smiled as she brought her horse to arnstop. \"Yes it seems thatrnway. I'm guessing the Saxons are not ones to dance. They mostrnlikely prefer to spend the day sitting on their fat asses talkingrnabout their manliness.\" Gwenhwyfar burst into laughter and kickedrnher horse to get him moving toward the outer walls of the castlernagain. She was anxious to see Lancelot. The four weeks that theyrnhad spent apart from each other had been enough to make her miserablernwithout him. As the party approachedrnthe castle wall one of the guards took notice of their party andrnsignaled for them to be escorted in. Gwenhwyfar saw how the peoplernturned to stare as she and Morgaine rode in. She knew that peoplernfeared the mysteries of Avalon, but did not expect the wholerncourtyard to cease all motion at their arrival. \"I guess we worernthe wrong outfit.\" Morgaine joked as she set a firm gaze to all ofrnthe people around her. She was about to ask one of the guards wherernshe could find her brother when she heard her name shouted fromrnacross the courtyard. \"Morgaine!\" Arthurrnhad shouted from a doorway that lead to the heart of Camelot andrnwhere he was conferring with his knights. They had been discussingrnhow to properly rid the kingdom of all things Saxon when one of thernguards came rushing in. \"My lord.\" He saidrnand waited for Arthur to acknowledge his presence. \"A party ofrnriders has just arrived my lord.\" He continued when Arthur wavedrnhis hand for him to continue. \"Who are the riders?\"rn Lancelot spoke up from Arthur's side. In the few weeks he hadrnspent as a knight, Arthur had realized that to make proper decisionsrnas to the welfare of Camelot, he would need someone's counsel. SornLancelot had become Arthur's closest confidant and second inrncommand. \"I do not know themrnby name my lord, but the riders are two women who look to be dressedrnin the fashion of the fairy people sire.\" The young guard babbledrnafraid of the trouble he could be in for giving the wrong answer. \"What on earth arernyou talking about?\" Arthur questioned the guard. \"Are there two menrndressed in brown clothes with them?\" Lancelot asked before thernterrified guard could continue. \"Yes my lord.\" \"There here!\"rnLancelot exclaimed with a huge grin on his face. \"Who cousin?\" \"Morgaine andrnGwenhwyfar, my wife. They have come from Avalon for yourrncoronation.\" \"Morgaine is here!\"rn Arthur exclaimed and ran out the doorway that lead to the courtyardrnfollowed closely by Lancelot. He was prepared to run straight to hisrnsister's arms when he realized he did know what kind of womanrnMorgaine had grown into. He did not want to run up and embrace thernwrong person. \"Where is she Lancelot?\" \"Arthur...\"rnLancelot laughed. \"Don't you recognize your own sister! She isrnthere atop the horse.\" He answered and pointed down to wherernMorgaine and Gwenhwyfar were still waiting on their horses. \"Morgaine!\" Arthurrnshouted and saw his sister turn her head to face him, a huge smilernimmediately gracing her face. Arthur didn't wait another secondrnbefore he took off running to where Morgaine was now getting off ofrnher horse. Morgaine had justrntouched the ground when Arthur ran up to her with Lancelot followingrnclose behind. She threw her arms around him and was smiling laughingrnso much she could hardly talk let alone exclaim \"Look at you, yournare huge. Where did my little brother go!\" \"Oh Morgaine it is sorngood to see you again, it has truly been to long!\" Arthur answeredrnand pulled Morgaine into another hug. \"So husband are yourngoing to help me down from this horse or am I going to spend my timernin Camelot stuck atop here?\" Morgaine heard Gwenhwyfar say fromrnwhere she was still sitting on her horse. \"Once a princessrnalways a princess.\" Lancelot responded pretending to be annoyedrnand helped his wife down. As soon as Gwenhwyfar's feet touched thernground smiles broke across both her and Lancelot's faces. \"Lancelot cousin whornmay this be?\" Arthur asked and watched as his greatest fighter andrnwarrior tenderly embraced the fair lady in front of him. \"My lord may Irnpresent my wife Gwenhwyfar, priestess of Avalon.\" Lancelot saidrnand presented his wife to his king. \"My lady, I amrnhonored to meet you.\" Arthur stammered out his greeting whenrnGwenhwyfar turned to face him. Arthur had seen many women since hernhad come to Camelot, but none had taken away his breath with theirrnbeauty the way the woman in front of him did now. \"You are mostrnwelcome to my kingdom my lady. I hope you will pardon my surprise,rnLancelot failed to mention that he was married. My knights and Irnknew nothing of you.\" \"That is quite allrnright my lord, Lancelot and I have only been married for a shortrntime. I'm sure with all he has been doing for you here he has notrneven had time to think of me.\" Gwenhwyfar answered Arthur with arnsmile. \"Well my lady you arernmost welcome. Please come, you and my sister must meet my knights.\"rn Arthur said taking Morgaine's hand and leading her back into therndoorway he had burst from moments before. As they entered the roomrnwhere the knights were waiting at the round table, Arthur's mostrntrusted companions stood. \"Knights my sister has come to Camelotrnfrom Avalon. We will have a celebration like none before tonight.rnWe will celebrate to a new beginning of a world that unites the oldrnways and the new.\" Arthur proclaimed and grinned when the knightsrnlet out a roar of rejoicing. \"Now you must meet myrnknights.\" Arthur continued and introduced Morgaine to each of thernmen poised around him. \"Percival. Galahad. Barken. And this isrnGwain. He is our cousin the first born of our aunt Morgause.\" Morgaine smiled andrnembraced her new found cousin. Although the priestesses and Vivianrnhad been like family on Avalon, it had been a long time since she hadrnbeen with blood relations. \"I am very happy to meet you.\" \"And this is Accolon,rnone of your younger knights but one of our best fighters.\" Arthurrnintroduced Morgaine and watched as the young knight struggled to formrnwords as he gazed at his king's sister. \"It is an honor tornmeet a priestess of the enchanted land my lady, I long to visitrnAvalon and learn of its ways.\" Accolon managed to get out. \"I would be happy tornanswer any questions you may have.\" Morgaine said back with arnsmile that had come across her face as soon as Arthur had introducedrnher. Accolon was different than all the other men she had been inrncontact with during her life so far. The time that she had spentrnlearning from Vivian, she had only seen the silent guards and Merlinrnon his few visits to Avalon. Accolon was younger than her but yetrnseemed very wise. Morgaine supposed that came from having beenrnexposed to war and struggling to serve others. He was very handsomernas well. His dark hair and well kept beard was very appealingrncompared to those men who let their beards grow long and scraggly. \"So Lancelot! Who isrnthis beauty that you have with you? She's too homely to be stuckrnwith you!\" Galahad shouted out and made the rest of the men laugh. \"My lords andrnfriends, this is my wife...\" \"Gwenhwyfar!\" ","Summary":" Mists of Avalon Story Ever since I saw the Mists of Avalon on TV I have had this story picturednin "},{"Movie":"Mists of Avalon","Title":"I am Morgane le Fey","Author":"snazy piranha","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1817441","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I am Morgane le Fey Prologue Seas of water, seas of time.

Thanknyou especially 'Me Acorn and Sometimes Bananas', your review really pushednme to write this instead of letting it sit unfinished on my computer! So,neveryone, please enjoy! Disclaimer: The main characters and such things like Avalon belong to thenauthor of 'The Mists of Avalon', and I also got some ideas from the movien'Merlin', and the book by Nancy Brimmer. But Morgane's feelings, her pointnof views, and quite a bit of the plot belong to me. Chapter One Once upon a time of joy... The Duke of Cornwall and his wife, the Lady Igraine, were a happy couplenliving in Britain and favored by the King. They had all they had ever hopednfor. The Duke was rich, successful, and almost as powerful as the Kingnhimself was. Igraine, the most beautiful woman in Britain was happy, shenloved her husband and her home. One stormy night, the stars gave them the most precious gift they had evernwished for. A little girl named Morgane. Me. I had a happy childhood, I wasngiven all that I could ever want, and I loved my nanny, an old peddlernwoman named Beth. My unmarried aunt Morgause lived with us, and I spendnmost my days with her and Beth. I ran around the meadows surrounding ournmanor, learning names of plants with the help of Nanny Beth, and returnednhome panting into mother's velvet lap. When I turned two, my mother Igrainengave birth to another daughter, Anna. Even though she had not given mynfather the son he wanted, he still loved her very much. We were a happynfamily. Life was so simple. When I was hungry, I ate. When I was tired, I slept.nWhen I wanted something, I screamed and kicked until I got it. I didn'tnhave to make decisions, I didn't have to think, didn't have to worry. Yetnthings couldn't always be this way, nothing ever can. I knew from an early age that I was different. Different than those villagengirls who played with dolls and were afraid of dirtying their frocks. Inwould long to know more about the things I heard and saw my mother andnAuntie Morgause doing. Magic.nI wanted knowledge. I yearned for it. I needed to know things, why thenworld was round, why we died, why water puts out fire. I craved it, and Inread anything I could to learn as much as I possibly could. I was still sonyoung, only six years old. Yet I needed to find things, learn what is what,nand where is where. So that was why, when I heard that my Aunt Viviannenwould be paying us a visit, I prepared myself the best that I could. I barely knew my Aunt Vivianne, I had never met her, except for thenoccasion of my birthing ceremony. All I knew about her was what I heardnfrom m y mother and Aunt Morgause while I eavesdropped. I knew thatnVivianne was a great and powerful woman, who's beauty was legendary, andnwho's intelligence none could match. I knew that she was some kind of anruler of a distant magical land. I couln't wait to meet her. I hoped thatnshe would help realise my dreams to be great and powerful. I knew that Inwas destined for more than a life as a house wife. I was going to challengenmy fate, and even then I knew it.[Chapter 3] I am Morgane le Fey Chapter 2 We all prepared for Viviane, for she was an important woman. The manor wasnthoroughly cleaned, unfortunately with my help, vegetables were picked andnfresh bread baked, and, much to my dismay and annoyance, Anna and I werenfitted for new frocks. Why is it that it takes so long just to fit us for andress? It's ridiculous. I had to waste many mornings sitting there like Inwas dead. To add to my impatience, the dressmakers complained that Infidgeted too much, and I was kept far longer than Anna. Damn Anna with allnher patience and virtue, she was a great burden in later years...but I'mngoing too fast. When I saw my dress, I decided that it was all worth it tonlook my best in front of Aunt Viviane. The day soon came, and I was excited beyond belief, I could not understandnhow Anna could sit there still and perfect like a little china doll. I wasnconstantly being reminded not to fidget or move, for I would rumple myndress. I couldn't help it. I was about to meet Auntie Viviane; a woman whomnI hoped could help me realize my dream of greatness. The entire day no onendid anything, everyone sat still and waiting, holding his or her breathsnwith apprehension, even nurse didn't budge. An hour went by. Two. Three.nFour. After five hours had gone by, nurse got up and told us to go back tonwork. I was broken hearted. I had longed so much to meet Aunt Viviane, anwoman I had heard so much about. \"Come along now Morgane,\" said Nurse severely, \"be a good little girl andngo back to your embroidery, we must not waste the day moping about, therenare things to be done.\" \"But why isn't Viviane coming? You promised!\" I shouted, it wasn't fair. Nurse, instead of chiding me like I wasnexpecting, simply didn't utter a word, but I could tell she was displeasednwith Viviane. Ruler or no, Nurse thought she didn't have the right to makenus wait. Just as we all started to bring out our daily tasks, I noticed somethingnfunny happening in the water basin. \"Mama, look!\" My mother came running and gazed into the water. She began to sing, singingna song in a language I did not recognize, but seemed familiar. \"Gairti lochan bass, fala vun patin.nKa leigh ma bebit, tee masta bar datin.nCorla, o Mona, cheec tonie dan hughnViviane, Viviane, sin tak bonlugh.\" With her chanting the water began to churn, changing colors from blue tonsilver to green and back to blue. We all watched. Suddenly, mother stopped,nand she looked at us with a smile on her face. \"The Lady is here.\" * * * Thanks to all my reviewers! I hope you liked this chapter, I got kind ofnfrustrated with it, I wasn't sure where to put what, and things like thatnthat I'm sure you all don't want to hear about, right? Haha, don't answernthat... Anyways, the next chapter, as you probably already guessed, you allnget to meet Viviane! Yay! Just to warn you, if you have seen the movien'Mists of Avalon' with Angelica Houston as Viviane, (why did they cast hernas Viviane?????) well, MY Viviane is different! I'm not sure if that's angood thing or not....Hum, we'll just have to see! Snuffles 55: Yes, I know, I should slow it down, but trust me, there'sngoing to be enough detail, and I really really really needed to get thenstory moving, because there is a lot more interesting things that are goingnto happen than Morgane's early years, which are basically full of treatsnand things, so I'm speeding up to where her life starts to change! Me Acorn and Sometimes Bananas: LOVED that quote, it was funny, it made menfall of my chair, and I almost broke something...the chair that is! Hahahah...nYeah, the spacing was weird, but I fixed it! Teigr: Thanks! Yeah, I really tried to show that she really wanted to learnnthe 'ancient arts', which helps her become the person she is! Michele: Hehe, thanks for bearing with me![Chapter 4] I am Morgane le Fey Chapter 3 \"The Lady is here.\" I gasped, and I wasn't the only one. Even though we were all expecting her,nwe were all in shock that she was actually here. Father even lookednsurprised, I knew that he had only met Viviane once before, at his andnMother's wedding, and only for a moment. I noticed that the water in the basin was slowly returning to its normalncontent. I watched the silvers and greens swirl into oblivion, and withnthem came the sound of horse hooves. Clip clop clip clop. I ran to thenwindow, and there she was. Alone and majestic, riding a snow-whitenstallion. I couldn't see her, much to my dismay, she was wearing a midnightnblue cloak with silver symbols on it. I leaned far out to see her and to myngreat surprise, she looked up. I nearly tumbled down to my death. Never hadnI seen a face more beautiful. She had straight, shimmering blond hair thatnwent down her back, snow-white skin, and her eyes... I recognized them to benthe same as my own. Pure silver, odd eyes, nurse always said. I couldn'tnbelieve it; she had my eyes, my eyes. Then she lowered her head, and rode on to the manor entrance, far out ofnview. All of us ran to greet her. I reached the door, and just as I wasnabout to open the door, it flew open of its own accord, and there shenstood. She stared at us, her face full of intelligence, wisdom, and herneyes showed that she had seen many things in her lifetime. Cruelty,nsuffering, hatred, and revenge. Then my mother and aunt went over to her,nwelcoming their sister. Viviane greeted them coldly and silently. Then shenstood there, gazing at each of us, as if looking for something. Shenapparently didn't find it in Father, though she did stop for a second innfront of Nurse, and she most definitely didn't find it in Anna judging bynher scornful face, though Anna, too immersed in looking her best, didn'tnnotice. Then she stopped when she reached me. \"So this is Morgane.\" I nodded. \"Yes, that's our Morgane, smart little lass she is,\" said Father jovially. Viviane turned her gaze onto father. \"So this is Geneth. My, my, Igraine,nyou certainly could have done better.\" She gave him a harsh look, making mynfather look puzzled, wondering what he had done wrong. We had dinner, and I just stared at Viviane, she mesmerized me. She wasnquite cold, she didn't talk much unless asked a question, and then she gavensharp, direct answers. That evening, I woke up near midnight because I heard voices. I gentlyntiptoed to where the voices where. I came to the living room where I sawnmother, Aunt Morgause and Viviane deep in discussion. I couldn't hearnanything, only mumbles. What they were saying, though I could not hear it,nwas this. \"But I can't, I can't!\" Mother shouted furiously, apparently upset by whatnViviane was telling her. \"Listen Igraine. Britain is falling apart. Without this sacrifice, Britainnwill be lost to the Ages. Soon, the King shall die, and instead of leavingnyour husband the King, as previously planned, a warrior shall be given thentitle. A man who's family is represented by the dragon. Now, you shall bearnthis man a son Igraine, and if you do not, this kingdom shall be lostnforever.\" \"But I can't,\" shouted Igraine. \"I gave my vows to Geneth, I honor him, Incan not betray him by being violated and bedded by another man other thannmy husband! No, this son I shall not bear. Britain shall fall, I do notncare.\" \"How can you be so selfish? You must! It has been seen, it has beennforetold. This child shall change the stars, and if you do not bear him,nall shall be lost, your precious Geneth, your children, yourself,neverything.\" Here, Morgause stepped forwards. \"I will bear him Viviane! I have no one tonbetray, let me seduce this future king; I want to do it! It's not fair,nIgraine has everything, whereas I have nothing. Why can't this be my momentnof glory?\" \"Shut up, you insolent excuse for a woman. You know very well that one cannnot take another's fate. How dare you presume to take this boon? I amnashamed to call thee sister.\" Morgause shrank back into the shadows, ashamed. I could still only hear mumbles, but then I felt something strange. My eyesnstarted to go out of focus; I had to strain to see. Then everything startedndisappearing...everything was black...then I saw things... I shrieked, and fell to the ground. Viviane, Mother and Auntie rushednforwards. Viviane held me up, asking, what is it child, what do you see? \"I see...death! And a...a...a red dragon. Fires...and blood!\" I gasped, and buried myself in Mother's lap while she stroked my hair.nViviane looked at mother and Auntie, and said proudly, \"She has the sight.\" * * * Hey! I hope you all liked it! Haha, I finally made a long chapter tonsatisfy you! Hope you enjoyed it! Now, I know that this part was a bit liken'Mists of Avalon,' but I assure you all, it is going to change a lot, Injust liked to put it this way! Thanks for all your tremendous support, itnmeans a lot! (Corny I know, but oh well, go with it, eh?) Me Acorn and Sometimes Banana: Well, I actually made the song up, but itncomes back, not the song exactly but...well, I can't tell you! That wouldngive some stuff away! Oh yes, I'm very evil...actually, not quite...nevernmind...I'm just a tad wee insane right now, don't mind me! Teigr: Hey! I hope you are happy with how Viviane turned out, I am! Oh, andnabout the song, just read what I wrote for 'Me Acorn and Sometimes Banana'.nI'm so glad you liked the foreshadowing, I thought it was good too, not ton'toot my own horn' as my little sister says! Anna comes in later on, andnthis just helps explain her a bit! Snuffles 55: Thanks! I'm glad you liked it! Thanks for all yournencouragement![Chapter 5] I am Morgane le Fey Chapter 4 I didn't think much of what Viviane had said, or what they were discussing,nI just wanted to go to sleep. But when I was in my bed, I couldn't sleep,nso I just thought. What could it all have meant? What about my vision?nViviane had said that I had something called 'the sight', was I special?nThere were lots of things I didn't know. After a lot of tossing andnturning, I finally fell asleep. The next morning Viviane told us that we were all going to go see the King.nI was ecstatic, I hadn't been out of the house for a long time. So Nursenhelped Anna and I dress up in our best dresses and ribbons, for we were tonattend a great banquet. Mother and Auntie Morgause dressed in gowns of the latest fashions, Mothernin red and Morgause in green. Viviane's dress was the grandest of them all,nmade of something I had never seen before, and not at all like the dressesncourt women wore. It was silvery blue, and it was tight around her torso,nthen it billowed out below her stomach in a bell form, and strangely, itnhad no sleeves. The dress stopped over her breasts, displaying her snow-nwhite arms and neck. Around her neck she had a simple chain of silver, fromnwhich hung a large, navy blue stone that seemed to move as she did. Inwanted to be so much like her. She was exactly who I wanted to be,nmajestic, strong, and mysterious. It took a long time to reach the palace, Anna kept pinching me to keep menawake so that I wouldn't wrinkle my dress. We finally reached it, and wenwent into the hall. Never had I seen more people in my entire life! It wasnunbelievable, the entire hall, about the size of six rooms was entirelynfull with well-dressed important people. After we ate, Anna and I were sent outside to play. I knew that they werengoing to talk about something important, and I had no intention of notnhearing about it. Anna, of course, went and sat down and began to play withna ball. I stuck back into the hall, no one noticed me for I was so tiny. Incould slip in and out of them very easily. Then I saw mother coming, and Inscreeched and dove under a table. Fortunately for me, it was the same tablenmother, Auntie, Father, Viviane, the King and some other strange men wentnto sit down at. I grinned, I could listen all I wanted! They began to talk about boring things, such as money and the government.nThen I heard something more fascinating. \"I have now decided who is to be future king,\" the king said, \"I am notngoing to be here much longer, and I have made my choice. Geneth, you arennot to be king as previously planned.\" Mother let out a gasp, and fathernshook with anger. \"Uther Pendragon shall be the new King.\" I froze. Pendragon...Pendragon...hum, where have I heard that name? I let itnpass, and I listened some more. They continued to talk about politics andnsuch, and I soon fell asleep. I awoke instants later, and climbed out fromnunder the table. I was perplexed by the expression on my mother's face. Shenhad the expression of complete adoration, sublime love, and peace. Inwondered what she was staring at. I followed her gaze to a tall, broad,nfairly handsome man. There was something about him that was familiar...Henbent down to pick up a napkin on the stone floor. He had the markings of a great red dragon on his arm. * * *nHey!

ThanksnTeigr, you are my best reviewer along with Mel! Luv you guys![Chapter 6] I am Morgane le Fey Chapter 5 Uther Pendragon stepped outside with my mother, and I followed. (Did younreally think I would pass up a chance like that? Never!)nI could hear them talk, but I didn't understand what it was about.nSomething about something else, and then someone did some other thing. Insoon got bored and left.nWhat I missed was this. \"Lady, I felt it, and you must feel it as well. We were meant to bentogether. You and I. I want you, and you want me. I know it. Come away withnme now, and we may be happy forever more.\" Uther spoke with muchnconviction. \"No! I cannot milord, I have pledged my undying love to the Duke ofnCornwall, and I must stay true to him. I am sorry. I do not feel anythingnfor you sire,\" Igraine spoke while her lips quivered. Oh, how she wishednshe could leave with him and be happy! She had never loved Geneth, but henhad provided her with love and shelter. A love that she could not return.nYet here it was, plain as day, her true love, and she could not go to him.nLife was cruel, but there wasn't anything she could do about it. She wasnsimply a woman, and even one with power was still regarded lowly. \"I love you, and I am sorry, Lady, but you shall not here the last of me,nnot until I get what I want. I always get what I want in the end.\" Henlooked at her, and extended his right hand to take hers. As he did this,nIgraine shook. She turned white, she had seen it. He had the mark of a redndragon on his arm, the sign. The dragon Morgane had seen, the mark of thenman she must submit to so that she could bear the man whom would raisenBritain. She ran and ran, before she could turn and go with him. Meanwhile, I was with Nurse, begging to go home, I was tired. We finallyndid much to my satisfaction. That night, I could hear mother and fathernfighting. Yelling and cursing, it scared me so much I could not sleep. Incould hear father saying things like: \"Dishonoring my name,\" \"You devilish whore,\" \"You are nothing but anconniving witch like your sisters,\" \"How dare you go behind my back andnbetray me,\" all sorts of evil things. Most words I did not understand, butnI could tell that it had something to do about the dragon sir, somethingnwas not right... That morning, father said nothing; he just left quickly, while mother satndown quietly, crying into her porridge. We tried to comfort her, but AuntnMorgause told us to leave her alone, to her own thoughts. I went out tonplay in the glen with some of my village friends, and as we had started anlovely game of bottle-grass, I saw my mother. She was lying on the freshngrass in a plain woolen gown, lying next to a pond of clear water. I camenup behind her to see what made her smile, and then my mother got up andnthrew a pebble in the water causing the image to scatter. But it was toonlate. I had seen it. I knew. She was in love with the Dragon Man; it was his face in the pond smiling upnat her. I looked at the face in disgust; he was an idiot, a fool, and anblunder. I hated the truth; I wanted to believe that my mother loved mynfather. But it wasn't so. She was in love with that oaf. I was still quite young, only 7 and I did not understand much about love,nonly that it made perfectly reasonable people act like fools. I did not seenwhat it was good for, it only ended in unhappiness and desperation. I thought that nothing could get worse, my young life was shattered, mynmother was not the strong, powerful woman I had wanted to be for so long.nShe was just a silly woman, who cared only of her own feelings. I wasndisgusted, she lay here pondering evil thoughts about a man other than hernhusband while my father worked hard to keep us together. I wanted nothingnmore to do with her. Yet little did I know that I would soon regret thosenwords, and that things did indeed get worse. The next night was when itnhappened. I learned from the little things I learned from nurse and the servants thatnFather hated Uther Pendragon, as did I. Mother floated about in her ownndreams, whispering his name and revelling in thoughts of him. I looked atnher pityingly. She did nothing but daydream. She had no meaning. I went to bed that night, unaware of what the next day would bring. That night, there was a terrible battle, one that I knew nothing about. Here is what happened. *nThe Duke of Cornwall thought that Uther Pendragon was sleeping with hisnwife, and he felt that it was his duty to slay him in order to protect thenrights of his family name. Yet what he did not know was that far across thenmountains, deep into the mists, in a land of mystical and magical beings,nViviane called to Uther, warning him of the coming challenge. Uthernsurprised the Duke, and slay him six times in the heart, relishing everynminute, knowing that he could finally take what he wanted. After he hadndone this, he looked up, and saw a true wonder. There stood a beautifulnwoman, with blue light around her. She told him that she would help him getnwhat he wanted. He nodded silently, overcome with happiness and triumph. *nI woke that morning, and I heard that there had been a great fight thatnnight. My heart skipped a beat, was father alright? I ran to my window, andnthere he was, riding in. I was happy. I ran down, and he hugged me. Inlooked at his arm, smiling. Then I saw it. The red dragon. I stopped in myntracks, too shocked to do anything. Then my mother greeted him, and he lednher to their room. Something was terribly wrong. ~*END OF FITH CHAPTER~* Hey! I hope you all liked it!

","Summary":" I am Morgane le Fey Prologue Seas of water, seas of time. Both isolate the once great Camelot, a re"},{"Movie":"Almost Famous","Title":"I'm With the Band","Author":"BSparrow","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4547330","Passage":"[Chapter 1] In case you were wondering, no I don't own anything related to Almost Famous or The Beatles...obviously. \"Lady! Lady! Where are you darling?\" Her mother's voice splintered the quiet like lightning striking a tree. Lady winced, kicking her brand new suitcase under her bed just in time. Virginia Goodman burst through the bedroom door on a wave of Shalimar perfume. Her ratty fur-trimmed bathrobe billowed around her legs and a cigarette was clutched elegantly between long red fingernails. Her golden curls were piled on top of her head, spilling down around a face that had probably been remarkable twenty years before but now was coated with too many layers of makeup. She looked like a fragile and faded rose, a fallen Hollywood starlet. \"Lady, didn't you hear me calling you? No matter...I won't be home for dinner tonight darling. So I guess you'll be fending for yourself.\" Lady's mother floated towards the mirror hanging on her daughter's wall, automatically preening and smiling seductively at her own reflection as she spoke. \"Why should today be any different?\" Lady pasted on a fake smile, flopping down on her bed and staring listlessly at her mother's back. \"I have a date with Mr. Hogan from the pharmacy so I probably won't be home until late.\" She didn't wait for a reply as she left the room, apparently to finish her pre-date preparation, leaving behind a cloud of smoke and perfume. Lady shook her head sadly, staring at the empty space her mother had left behind. Over the years following her father's death, Lady had watched her mother's dates grow progressively older, poorer, and less attractive. Virginia Goodman had once been Virginia Beaulovie, an aspiring actress and full-time gold-digger. She had been the most beautiful and sought-after woman in Manhattan in her younger years. To hear her tell it, she'd been courted by countless men. Flown to Paris in private jets, given diamonds the size of gumballs, and outfitted in the latest designer clothes by various lovers. Then she had moved to California to pursue her acting career and met Harry Goodman, a nice hard-working middle school principal. Unlike her previous dates, he had taken her to a modest restaurant for dinner and then for a walk through a park to stare at the stars. And Virginia had fallen head over heels. They'd married soon after, and then a few years later Virginia had given birth to a daughter she named Lady...much to Harry's alarm. Lady remembered her younger years fondly. The house had seemed so much warmer and more welcoming with two loving parents living in it. But the day little Lady had turned eight, her father was killed in a horrible car accident on the way to pick up her birthday cake from the bakery. For months, Mrs. Goodman had mourned. She did little but lay in bed all day, sobbing and downing glasses of sherry. A parade of aunts, cousins, and family friends had swept through the house, cleaning and cooking while half-heartedly looking after the broken hearted little girl in the corner who wanted nothing more than to see her father again. Then one morning about a year later, Lady had gotten herself up for school and headed to the kitchen to fix her usual bowl of cereal. Virginia had met her over the breakfast table, looking ten years older but far perkier than she had in months. Barely able to contain her excitement, she informed her daughter that an old boyfriend had heard of her husband's death and wanted to take her out for dinner that night. Lady was taken aback but said nothing. What could she say? This was her mother. Nothing came of that first date but it didn't matter. It was followed by plenty more. An aching emptiness settled on Lady's chest as she heard her mother humming and fiddling with makeup and perfume bottles in her bedroom down the hall. Could she really do this? Could she really leave her life behind, change it all? She answered herself quickly...yes, she could. Leaning over, she flicked on the radio and dragged her suit case back out from under the bed. As she began packing, she tried to imagine what her life would be like. She knew who she would go to. She'd met him just a few years earlier when her mother and her boyfriend at the time (Lyle the concert promoter) had taken her along on their date. She'd been so much younger and more naive then. But he had been so sweet when he'd rescued her like a knight with a shining guitar. She had loved the time she'd spent backstage with him, reveling in the chaos and the music. It had felt like she was finally at home. Light and sound and voices all around her, enclosing her like a blanket. Then it had all ended too soon when Virginia and her boyfriend swooped in and carried her home. But she knew he'd have her back. She just knew it. She couldn't even think about what would happen if he took one look at her and no recognition dawned on his face. She couldn't think that way because she had no other options. But before she even got that far, she knew she needed to change her name. Nobody could take a little blonde girl named Lady seriously. All the pretty girls she had met that night backstage had such beautiful and exotic names. Besides, Lady had never fit her to begin with. It was much more appropriate for someone like her mother. Lady was lost in thought and barely noticed when The Beatles voices came over the radio, singing \"Penny Lane\". Without thinking, she began to sing along quietly, shoving a pair of shoes into the suitcase. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes...there beneath the blue suburban skies. Penny Lane. Penny Lane. The name stuck in her head, bouncing around in her ears and rolling off her tongue so delightfully. The thought struck her, bringing a smile to her face. That could be her name. Penny. Penny Lane. It fit somehow. Still smiling, she snapped the suitcase closed.[Chapter 2] I don't own anything related to The Rolling Stones either. Thanks for the review and the tip...I enabled the anonymous reviews! : ) As soon as Virginia had been picked up at the door by her greasy bald date, Penny (as she now thought of herself) finished getting ready to set out on her own. She knew that he was going to be performing tonight. That was what had inspired her to finally leave. Her small suitcase was stuffed with clothing and shoes but now she needed something to hold everything else. Opening her closet, Penny felt around in the dark corner until her hand hit hard cold plastic. Her father's old tackle box. She sat on the floor and pulled it in to her lap, brushing off the dust and feeling warm and nostalgic. She remembered the times he had taken her on fishing trips. They'd gotten up before dawn and drove an hour to the lake outside town. They'd never really caught much of anything but they'd had a great time laughing and eating soggy ham and cheese sandwiches. Penny dumped out the fishing lures and hooks and wiped the small box clean. This would be perfect. Now all that she needed was something to make her stick out. Something to get her noticed. Feeling somewhat guilty, she snuck into Virginia's closet which was brimming with clothes. Some were designer labels, some she had spent hours picking out at second-hand stores. One of the things she had always taught Penny was that appearances were everything. You should always look your best, no matter what. After picking through hanger after hanger of clothing, Penny came across what she was looking for. It was a gorgeous deep green embroidered coat with luscious white fur trim. Perfect. Penny slipped it on and it fit perfectly. Obviously it was from her mother's younger years. Glancing at the clock, she found it was already getting late. Time to go. Grabbing her suitcase and tackle box, she slipped out the door and down the sidewalk. The sun was setting, casting the neighborhood in rich orange-tinted light. Penny felt the excitement and anticipation building up inside, filling her chest and finally bubbling out in the first real laugh she'd felt in years. A weight seemed to lift off her chest as she got further and further away from her house. She wasn't surprised that she had no urge to look back. A little more than an hour later she was standing in the dark outside the back door of the San Diego arena. Inside, the opening act was warming up but she wasn't interested in them. Now that she was here she wasn't feeling quite as confident. The worry that he wouldn't remember her was overwhelming, running through her head constantly. He'd probably seen so many girls since that night years ago. \"Hi.\" A throaty voice said from behind, making Penny jump. She turned to see a girl that looked about the same age as her with long dark brown hair and heavy makeup. \"You waiting for the Stones too?\" The girl smiled a crooked smile and leaned against the wall next to Penny. \"Yeah…I didn't know if I was in the right place.\" Penny said, dropping her suitcase beside her with a loud thump. \"Looks like you're in it for the long haul. Are you planning on going on the tour with 'em or something?\" The girl laughed and lit a cigarette offering one to Penny. Penny nodded and accepted it awkwardly, watching the girl and imitating her. The smoke burned her throat but she tried to ignore it. \"No…well I don't know. I don't really know what I'm doing.\" She confessed quietly, looking away as a few concert-goers passed by them. \"This is your first time? Well look, I'm Sapphire. Just stick with me, okay?\" The girl smiled sincerely at Penny, shifting her weight from one high platform to the other. \"Really? Can you help me meet Keith?\" Penny asked hopefully, stubbing out her half-smoked cigarette. \"Sure. Why not Mick?\" \"Mick's fine…but I really want to see Keith again.\" Penny smiled, feeling warm and cozy inside thinking about him. \"What's your name?\" Sapphire asked, peering at Penny curiously in the dark. \"Penny. Penny Lane.\" She answered automatically and proceeded to tell her new best friend her story. It wasn't long before Sapphire had muscled her way past the doorman, dragging Penny along with her. Backstage it was disorder and disarray. Roadies were running around in circles, lugging instruments and equipment. Other girls with taller platforms and lower standards were eyeing the newcomers warily. \"Ignore the roadies. If you flirt with them, you'll never get near the band. They'll just spread it around that you're an easy lay.\" Sapphire advised as a roadie carrying a guitar case smiled at Penny. \"Where are we going?\" Penny asked, drinking in the pandemonium blissfully. \"To the band room.\" Penny felt a stab of anxiety and butterflies with iron wings took flight in her stomach.[Chapter 3] Yes, I know the whole age thing happened in Almost Famous. I did that on purpose, hoping to explain the story behind some of Penny's actions. And no, I'm not trying to say Keith is a pedophile or anything...I got their relationship from the script. :) Sapphire didn't seem to notice Penny's apprehension or feel any of her own. She bulldozed through people right and left before stopping short in front of a non-descript wooden door. Faint voices and deep male laughter could be heard from the other side. Penny gulped as Sapphire turned to her with a devilish smile and asked, \"You ready?\" \"No! What do I do? What if he doesn't remember me?\" Penny felt frantic, digging her fingernails into Sapphire's arm. \"Don't worry! And stop scratching me. It'll be okay, just hold your head up and act like you belong.\" Penny opened her mouth to speak but before she could get the words out the door flew open to reveal a thin man with wild dark hair dressed rather flamboyantly. He looked at the girls before him with dazed black eyes, taking a puff from the cigarette between his long elegant fingers. \"Oh my God.\" Penny felt the words slip out of her open mouth before she could stop them. Keith looked amused, shaking his head as Sapphire elbowed her sharply. \"Hi Keith…how's it going?\" Sapphire beamed up at him, tilting her head seductively to the side. He nodded at her and then looked to Penny who felt her heart stop as he did a double-take. \"You. You look familiar.\" He said, narrowing his eyes and looking down his nose at her as she stood before him trying to exude a confidence she didn't feel. \"I met you…about two years ago? You helped me when I almost got crushed by the crowd.\" Penny said, still gripping Sapphire's arm tightly. After a moment of studying her, recognition finally dawned in Keith's dark eyes, \"Lady. Wasn't that your name?\" A smile lit Penny's face as she nodded vigorously. \"Yeah! But now it's Penny.\" \"Ahhh, I don't blame you darling.\" Keith chuckled. \"What's going on out here?\" Mick stumbled through the doorway, throwing his arm around Keith's shoulders and smiling sinfully at Penny and Sapphire with those infamous lips. \"Mick! Darling! How have you been?\" Sapphire swooped in to press a kiss on his cheek as Keith stepped out and leaned in towards Penny. \"How have you been sweetheart? Forgive me for not recognizing you at first but…well you know how it is.\" A slow smirk crept across his lips as Penny stared up at him in wonder. \"I've been okay. I just remembered that you told me to look you up if you came back to town.\" Penny managed, trying to sound cool and calm. \"That I did. How old are you now Miss Penny? You were so young then.\" Penny didn't answer immediately. Should she tell him how old she was? What if he had her thrown straight out? How old could she pass for? \"Umm, 17.\" Penny said firmly, looking at the floor. \"If you're 17, darling, I'm 77.\" Keith laughed outright, brushing a blonde curl behind her ear. \"16?\" \"Try again.\" He shook his head. \"It's not hard to tell when people are lying, sweetheart.\" \"15.\" Penny finally admitted, biting her lip as he nodded. \"There we go. That wasn't so bad was it?\" Penny felt her heart flutter as Keith put his arm around her shoulders and led her into the room that Sapphire and Mick had disappeared into. Inside she saw the rest of the band grouped together, talking quietly. The boys appeared to be preparing for the show minus Mick. He was busy being cornered by Sapphire who seemed to be trying to sneak her hands down his velvet pants. Poor Mick looked wild-eyed and somewhat terrified…like a caged animal. \"Gentleman, say hello to the beautiful Miss Penny…\" Keith stopped and looked at her questioningly. \"Lane.\" Penny whispered, smiling at the boys and swallowing her nervousness, though it didn't go down easy. \"Penny Lane? Like the song? Alright darling. Say hello to the beautiful Miss Penny Lane.\" Keith pressed a kiss on her cheek as the other occupants of the room nodded and smiled their hellos. \"Okay boys, tighten up, it's time for the show. Follow me.\" The manager called out, knocking on the door as he passed by and interrupting Penny's moment of bliss. Mick seized the chance to escape from Sapphire's wandering hands and trotted out the door after his band-mates. Keith started to follow but must have noticed the uncertainty on Penny's face because he simply took her hand and smiled. Sapphire was close behind as he led her towards the stage. They stopped at the edge of the darkness near the manager and a few roadies. The stage glowed, empty and waiting before them as a sea of people stood waiting impatiently. \"Just stand here with the girls and enjoy, Miss Penny.\" He grinned, accepting his guitar from a roadie before following Mick out on stage. The crowd was wild with excitement by the time the band was introduced. A few half-crazed girls were already trying to climb on stage, much to the dismay of the numerous beefy security guards rushing to stop them. When the band launched into \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" the roar became deafening. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, Penny decided she felt right at home. This was what she needed… where she needed to be, the crowd she needed around her. Her past and her worries slipped away as the music soothed her raw nerves, relaxing her enough to allow her to sway along with the tune. She didn't even notice the other girls glaring daggers at her back. Beside her, Sapphire was grinning like a lunatic, her eyes on Mick as he pranced across the stage. Penny closed her eyes and smiled, letting the music flow over her as she enjoyed the moment for what it was.[Chapter 4] All too soon the show had ended and the crowd began streaming out of the arena, except for a few die-hards who were clamoring at the front of the stage for an autograph. The roadies rushed in to begin dismantling the equipment and Penny felt the energy dropping around her. The show had been the pinnacle and now the after-math seemed like such a letdown. She could see Keith at the front of the stage autographing a shirt for a young boy who looked at him with starry eyes. Unsure if it was allowed, Penny took a tentative step out on to the stage, peering out to see what the boys saw when they performed. She saw trampled flowers, scraps of paper, and silky undergarments littering the stage and couldn't help but smile to herself. It was like art. Before she could take another step, the Stones went filing past her, laughing and dripping with sweat. Keith's dark eyes connected with hers and she tucked herself under his arm, feeling even more attached to him than she had before. Back in the band room, the party was in full-swing. Girls were trying to cram themselves through the doorway to get to the boys. Penny was clinging to Keith, determined to keep him from the parade of hungry-looking girls who continually sashayed past him. She watched as enough alcohol to drown an army was wheeled into the room and put on ice. Everyone took a drink except for Penny. She preferred to sit back and watch the happenings while listening to Keith's voice. She couldn't help but laugh when she saw that the tables had turned and now Mick was pursuing Sapphire who seemed to be enjoying the chase. \"Great show boys, great show. Girls, may I borrow the band for a moment? Just a moment, I'll return them in one piece.\" The manager breezed into the room, looking frazzled but competent. His assistant followed closely, carrying an armload of clothing. Before Penny realized what was happening he had tossed a few rumpled shirts straight at her. They landed on her lap and at her feet in a heap as she stared at him in confusion. \"You're with Keith right? Those are his shirts that need ironing. Iron's in the back.\" He said dismissively, moving on and muttering about being taken advantage of by the \"bloody band\". Penny picked up one of the shirts between two fingers, frowning at it as it dangled limply from her hand like a dead animal. Sapphire flopped down on the couch at her side, a cigarette in one hand and a glass in the other. She elbowed Penny in the ribs for the second time that night. \"Stop making that face. It's not all glamour, honey. Sometimes we gotta do the dirty work too. We're like their wives on the road…and ironing isn't that bad. Do you know how?\" Penny nodded slowly as Sapphire's words sank in. Of course she knew how to iron. Virginia Goodman would never have her lily white hands ruined by menial household chores, even when Penny's father had been alive. And while Penny had enjoyed the glamorous part of the evening, this somehow felt even more intimate than standing off-stage during the show. \"Yeah, I know how. Can you show me where the ironing board is?\" Penny stood with the armload of shirts, smiling at Sapphire's approving expression. After the meeting was over and the ironing was finished, it was time to leave. Sapphire reported that the destination was the Plaza. \"They're too big to stay at the Riot House anymore. And I think they're banned there anyways.\" Sapphire told Penny as they joined the group of girls following the band out to a waiting limousine. Inside, it was a tight fit. Raucous laughter and catcalls bounced off the walls. Penny found herself jostled into sitting on Mick's velvet-encased lap. She blushed as he raised an elegant eyebrow at her precarious position and obvious discomfort. Ignoring his lascivious wink, she watched observantly as her suitcase and tackle box purse were loaded up with the rest of the luggage and then they were off. The ride was a short one, filled with recaps of the show and dirty jokes. At some point Keith noticed her seating arrangement and burst into laughter, dragging her into his own lap. Penny felt both comforted and somewhat disturbed that she was being treated like a piece of drapery. That thought quickly disappeared when he kissed her cheek and whispered in her ear before pushing his bottle of god-only-knew-what into her hand. Penny took a hesitant sip, wincing as liquid fire slipped down her throat. \"Good girl.\" Keith grinned, patting her blonde curls fondly as they bounced on down the highway. Their arrival at the hotel was more chaotic than the show. Crowds of people milled around outside the front entrance so the limo circled around to the back. Only a few more experienced fans were waiting at the service door. The boys rushed in, ducking and swerving from the frenzied fans that wanted nothing more than to just touch them. Penny grabbed her things and followed Sapphire, tripping on her platforms but rushing to catch up with her friend. \"What happens now?\" Penny whispered loudly, limping along while trying to shove her foot back into her shoe. \"We'll see. The boys will probably head to their rooms and take a girl or two with them. You need to find Keith and I'm gonna go find Mr. Jagger. Oh and hey…good luck tonight. Don't be nervous.\" Sapphire beamed at Penny, before veering off as she spotted her target down a hallway. Penny stopped to watch her go, standing in the middle of the quiet hall and feeling hopelessly lost and worried. Was she destined to spend the night wandering the hallway and knocking on doors? She was determined to spend the night with Keith. He had to be her first rock conquest or her whole plan would fall to pieces. \"Are you lost, darling?\" A smooth, familiar voice filled with laughter sounded directly behind her. Penny turned to find Keith standing in an open doorway, grinning and motioning her inside. Relief followed by a shot of anxiety filled her as she stepped through the doorway to find the room empty except for the two of them. She dropped her things by the door and noticed Keith staring at her suitcase with a frown. She started to question what that gorgeous frown meant but he cut her off by pulling her into his arms. His forehead still glistened from the excitement of the show but he smelled wonderfully intoxicating. His exquisite silk suit felt indulgent against Penny's skin as she sank against him, her fingers running through his thick black hair. \"I'm so glad you came to see me tonight, Miss Penny Lane.\" He grinned, pressing a kiss on the tip of her nose before proceeding to kiss her thoroughly. Penny could only feel glad too. She had found her calling.[Chapter 5] From now on in the story, all bands and people will be fictional but probably based on real people. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out if you're at all into 60's and 70's rock. After this chapter, I'm probably going to skip ahead some so it's not a day by day sort of thing. Morning came for Penny around noon the next day when the hot sunlight finally broke through the half-closed brocade curtains covering the window. For a moment she was unsure where she was, as her eyes took in the sumptuous suite and the silky white sheets. Then the events of the previous night came flooding back to her, bringing a small smile to her lips. She looked around for Keith but found his spot on the bed already cold. She listened for the shower but the room was silent. Feeling a twinge of fear, she jumped out of bed, trailing the sheets behind her to cover herself as she threw open the door and looked into the hallway. At the end, near the back entrance of the hotel, she saw the band and the road crew busily gathering their equipment and preparing to leave. Penny cursed under her breath, tripping over the long sheet trailing behind her and stubbing her toe in her hurry to throw open her suitcase and get dressed. Gathering her things, she rushed out into the hallway, head first into Sapphire who looked as ragged as Penny felt. Glancing down the hallway, she saw she was already too late. The band had climbed into the limousine and the driver was shutting the door. Penny dropped her suitcase and flew down the hallway, throwing open the door and running out into the hot afternoon sun. Shielding her eyes against the glare, she squinted through the back window and could just make out the back of Keith's dark head. He wasn't turning around to see her, wasn't stopping the driver, and he obviously wasn't bringing her along. But someone else was turning around. Someone with shockingly blonde hair and a pair of stunning kohl-rimmed eyes. Eyes that stared at Penny threateningly, as if the girl they belonged to could read Penny's mind and knew exactly what she had been doing at the hotel. \"Anita.\" Penny turned to meet Sapphire's sympathetic gaze, feeling her heart turn to lead and sink, bringing all her naivety down with it. Penny opened her mouth to say something but couldn't quite form the words around the knot that was blocking her throat and bringing tears to her eyes. \"Hey, hey…don't cry honey. You got what you wanted, he got what he wanted. Oh and he didn't leave without saying goodbye…I found this note right inside the door of your room.\" Sapphire smiled weakly at Penny, understanding the lesson that her friend was learning the hard way as she handed over the slip of paper. Penny wiped her eyes and took a deep breath, unfolding the paper and reading it quietly aloud. Miss Penny Lane, Thanks for last night darling. Great time. I'll be sure to look you up next time I'm in town. Keith. Penny crumpled up the note and slid it into her pocket, rubbing her stinging eyes to hold back the tears. She felt stupid for feeling this way. What had she really expected? That he would fall in love and whisk her away? Marry her? Was that what she had really wanted from him in the first place? Penny answered herself by shaking her head. She didn't want to be his wife…she had enjoyed the time she had spent with him and she knew she would probably see him again one day. Until then, she could have fun. She was still free, out from under Virginia Goodman's thumb. \"You okay now?\" Sapphire asked, looking at her quizzically. \"Yeah…yeah, I'm okay.\" Penny smiled faintly and then laughed a little bit. \"How was your night?\" \"Wild.\" Sapphire groaned, combing her tangled hair with her fingers. \"So…what are you going to do now?\" Penny asked, wondering the same thing about herself. \"Take a shower. I don't think anybody will notice.\" Sapphire grinned. \"What about after that?\" \"Do you not have anywhere to go, Penny?\" Sapphire asked, her expression turning serious. \"No…I guess I don't.\" \"Want to come stay with me for a while? I'm going to the Riot House tonight to hang out with this new band called Black Bullet.\" Penny felt a rush of gratitude to her new best friend, someone she hadn't even known 24 hours ago. Strange how much one night could change a person's life. \"Yeah, I'd love to. Thank you.\" Sapphire only smiled and linked her arm through Penny's as they flounced back inside to wash off last night's makeup and get ready for the night ahead.[Chapter 6] One Year Later It had been exactly a year since that fateful day that Penny had abandoned her old life to throw herself into the overwhelming decadence of the world of rock and roll. She had promised herself on that day that she wouldn't look back and certainly wouldn't come back no matter what. She was proud to say that she had kept that promise, though at times it had been tempting. There was the night that she and Sapphire had walked into what they had thought was a party only to find a room full of naked people sitting in a circle around a goat, chanting in a terrifying sounding language. They didn't stick around to find out exactly what was going on, though a very well-known pop singer had stood up in the midst of the circle to invite them to join him. Then there was the time that Penny had been invited to a party by a notoriously eccentric drummer. When she had arrived at his house in Laurel Canyon, she was horrified to find there was no party and that he was naked and completely out of his mind on drugs. He had chased her around the house and then around the neighborhood with a devilish grin on his face until a kind older woman had hurried her inside her home and locked the door just before he slammed into it, howling like a wolf. Yet another time, she had been hanging out at the Whisky with a very stoic and handsome guitarist when he slipped something in her drink. Needless to say, his intentions weren't good. Penny had passed out but fortunately a friend had witnessed the whole thing and stopped the guitarist as he tried to carry her out to a waiting car. There had been good times and there had been bad ones, but she had never regretted her decision. She was grateful that Sapphire had shown her the ropes or she would have blundered into many more dangerous situations than she already had. \"Penny, hurry up!\" Sapphire's voice called from outside the bathroom. Penny took one last long look at herself in the mirror, smiling at her reflection. Sapphire had heard that a really amazing band called Sinking Ship was arriving tonight from England and was staying at the Riot. Penny didn't know much about them, she'd only heard their latest single but that had been enough. She immediately fell for the lead singer as soon as she heard his voice. When they arrived at the Riot House just over sunset, the place was swarming. A mob of crazed fans had surrounded the front door and extended well out into the busy street. Cars swerved to avoid them, blaring their horns and yelling obscenities. \"Good Lord.\" Sapphire muttered, slamming the door shut on her rickety old car. Linking arms, they waded through the crowd and into the lobby which was even more frenzied. \"I didn't think it would be this crazy.\" Penny frowned, pulling her fur-trimmed coat closer around her. \"We'll never find them like this.\" Sapphire mumbled thoughtfully, obviously trying to work it all out in her head. Penny stood in silence, observing the crowd around her. An unobtrusive older man pushing a luggage cart caught her eye. The cart was loaded with expensive European luggage and she noticed the tip of a shiny black guitar case sticking out from under the bags. \"Follow him.\" She whispered to Sapphire, motioning towards him casually. They set off down the hallway, a good distance behind. The man stopped at a service elevator and hit a button for the seventh floor. They let him get on and waited until he'd had enough time to get off again. Sapphire frantically punched the 7 button and the doors slid open. Before anyone could notice, they piled into the elevator, grinning elatedly. When the doors slid open again, they could already hear Sinking Ship's music blaring from the rooms at one end of the hall. The opposite end of the hall was silent and empty. The old man was pushing the empty cart back towards the elevator, eyeing them suspiciously. Without discussing the situation, they both tilted their heads in the air and flounced purposefully down the hall, offering the man a kind but superior smile as they stepped past him. As they neared the end of the hallway, they could hear loud voices through the door. \"Fine! Do what you want!\" The door in front of them flew open violently and out stepped a tall beautiful man with flowing wild blonde hair and dark blue eyes. \"I don't need you or your bloody guitar playing!\" He called over his shoulder at someone in the room, in an achingly beautiful and familiar voice. Penny shivered, unable to look away. It was him, her beautiful singer from Sinking Ship. The door slammed behind him and he looked away in disgust, walking past Penny and Sapphire without seeing them. Penny knew she couldn't let this moment slip away. She gently touched his arm as he walked by, smiling softly at him when he jerked his head around to look at her. \"Hi.\" She said, praying he wouldn't bite her head off and have her thrown out.[Chapter 7] Penny watched his face soften as his eyes took in the sight of her and Sapphire standing before him, fully decked out in their rock and roll finest…all fur, velvet, and feathers. \"Hi.\" He nodded, a smile slowly reaching his lips. \"Are you Will Pine?\" Penny ventured, knowing he was but wanting to let him know she recognized him. \"That's what they say. And who might you be, sweetheart?\" \"I'm Penny Lane and this is Sapphire. We're here to welcome your band to California.\" Penny smiled, sticking her hand out for him to shake and ignoring Sapphire's snort of laughter. He laughed, taking her hand in his and pressing a kiss on it instead. \"Well, thank you darling. I feel very welcome indeed.\" He stared into her eyes, and she shivered with delight. At her side, Sapphire cleared her throat, obviously itching to get to the rest of the band. Will looked at her with a raised brow. \"The rest of the bloody idiots are in there if you want to try your luck with them.\" Sapphire grinned and turned on her heel, knocking loudly on the door. Penny watched as a thin man with curly black hair and an angelic face opened the door. Sapphire purred her hello and he pulled her inside, shooting a venomous look at Will before slamming the door behind her. \"You didn't want to welcome James did you, Penny?\" Will asked in a teasing voice as he took another step closer to her. \"No, I came here to welcome you in particular.\" Penny smiled up at him, exuding every ounce of charm she could. \"Did you now? Well, let me see what we can do about that.\" He chuckled, leading her down the hallway and unlocking his door. Later that evening, while Penny was exiting the hotel room shower in a delightfully vanilla scented cloud of steam, a loud knock sounded on the door. Will groaned and slid out from under the sheets to answer the door while Penny hurried to throw on some clothes. The angelic dark haired man she had seen earlier stood in the hallway, his face much calmer now. Penny found herself wondering if Sapphire had something to do with that. \"Will, we're leaving for the show. Mark and Leon are already out in the car. Are you coming?\" He asked in a quiet, sophisticated voice as Sapphire came up beside him, smoothing her hair. Will only stared at him for a moment and Penny cringed, willing him to just suck it up and say yes. He turned to look at Penny for a moment, a thoughtful expression on his face. Finally he turned back to James and nodded. The ride to the show was more quiet than most, with Penny squished between Will and Sapphire. Her still-wet hair was twisted up on top of her head and a pin was poking her scalp, but Will's hand was on her thigh and that made it all okay. As they arrived at the venue, Will leaned over and whispered in her ear, \"Watch out for Jay when you get backstage. I'll have to leave you but you can sit on Jimmy's amp during the show so I can keep an eye on you.\" He smiled and patted her leg before climbing out of the car and rushing inside with his band-mates. She and Sapphire followed with Peter, the manager, who handed them passes to stick on. They promptly taped them above their knee's…much cooler than pasting them on your chest. \"Will told me to watch out for some guy named Jay backstage…isn't that sweet? I wonder who that is?\" Penny whispered to Sapphire, feeling giddy with excitement as they followed Peter through the maze of hallways. \"I don't know…James mentioned a guy named Jay too but he didn't say who he was. James is adorable isn't he? Everyone is raving about what an amazing guitar player he is.\" Sapphire gushed. \"Jay! Is the band in 2 or 4?\" Peter called out, hurrying towards a large sweaty-looking bearded man with fierce eyes. Penny and Sapphire exchanged a look of concern. Jay was eyeing them behind Peter, a lascivious smile on his terrible meaty face. \"2, Peter. Go ahead, I'll be right in.\" He growled, clapping Peter's thin shoulder with a hand like a catcher's mitt. Peter bustled on through a door down the hallway and Penny automatically took a step back from this monster of a man who was still staring. \"Why hello there chickies…what are you two doing backstage?\" \"I-I'm here with James and she's with Will.\" Sapphire stuttered, motioning to the passes they wore. Penny felt a chill skitter down her backbone as he took another step closer and they took another step back. \"Penny! There you are darling. Come on, I'll show you where to go.\" Will's voice and his arm around her shoulder was sweet relief. He hurried the two of them down the hall, shaking his head in disgust. \"Jay is hell on girls…we try to keep them all out of his clutches.\" Will sounded apologetic but Penny felt confused. \"If he's so bad, why do you all keep him around?\" She asked, knowing she sounded terribly naïve. \"He's the best at what he does. If somebody doesn't want to pay us, he makes sure they do. If someone doesn't want to book us, he gets us the show. Without him and Peter, we'd be nowhere.\" Will explained as they stopped near the stage. \"You two just hang around right here, climb up on the amp or something because the show will probably last a good while. You'll be fine here.\" He promised, kissing Penny's cheek before rushing off back to the band to get ready to go on. Penny and Sapphire did as they were told, astonished that they were allowed to sit in such a prestigious location. They were practically on stage! The roadies rushed around them, complaining as they set up equipment. Not very far away, the audience was cheering and shuffling around restlessly, anticipating the performance. Right before the show, a frazzled looking redhead wandered up to stand beside them, looking lost and out of place. \"Is this where I'm supposed to stand? Leon just told me to find a blonde and a brunette and stand with them.\" She whispered loudly, fiddling anxiously with her beaded necklace. Penny liked her immediately. \"Yeah, you're fine. I'm Penny and this is Sapphire.\" Penny smiled serenely at the girl, extending her hand for a shake. \"I'm Beth.\" The girl nodded, looking relieved. The start of the show silenced any more conversation. Penny was in heaven, Sinking Ship was even more amazing live. Will's voice raised chill bumps on her arms and James's guitar playing was unbelievable. She was lost in the music until she noticed Jay standing a few feet away, still staring at her with a look on his face that assured her he would have his way.[Chapter 8] One Year Later – 1971 \"Hey! Who is that girl? Why does she get to stand over there?\" An outraged voice from the other side of the barricade caught Penny's attention. She was leaning casually against Sinking Ship's waiting limousine, fiddling with her white feathered boa as she waited for the boys to come rushing out the back door. Peter had begged her to wait inside the car but the night air felt too delightful on her skin so she had ignored him and simply popped her cobalt blue sunglasses over her eyes. Penny had been hanging around Sinking Ship off and on for the past year, watching their steady rise to success until they became one of the biggest bands on the charts. Each time they came into town, Will made sure to call her up and have a pass waiting for her at the venue. \"Not fair! She's probably just some nasty groupie!\" Another voice tinged with jealousy answered the first, plenty loud enough to reach Penny's ears. Penny felt taken aback, shocked even. Those people didn't even know her! She opened her mouth to spout off an angry reply but thought better of it and simply turned her back on them. Sure, she knew exactly what she was and she was happy with herself. She didn't delude herself into thinking she was anything more than just that…a groupie. Penny had never seen it as something negative, something to be ashamed of. She was just a girl who liked groups, and groups seemed to like her back. What was so wrong about that? But with the way those two girls had spat out the word, it might as well have been \"scum\" or \"trash\". Penny decided right then and there that she didn't like that word anymore. If groupie meant something bad, something disgusting…then she wasn't a groupie. The wheels began turning in her mind as a commotion at the door alerted her that the band was on their way out. She slid into the car ahead of them, already formulating a plan. \"Okay…so I think we should call ourselves…the Band Dolls.\" Penny was sitting cross-legged on a bed next to Sapphire. She had explained what had happened to her the night before and told Sapphire her plan. Together, they could completely revolutionize the way people saw groupies. \"The Band Dolls?\" Sapphire stuck out her tongue, an obvious thumbs-down. \"Well, maybe not that then. But do you get what I'm saying here?\" Penny asked earnestly, twirling a lock of hair around her finger. \"Yeah, I totally understand. I think it's a great idea, honey. But we need a better name. And more girls.\" Sapphire leaned back against the headboard, tapping her finger on her chin and looking thoughtful. \"Hey, we could call Beth!\" Penny suggested eagerly, bouncing up to her knees and diving for the phone. The next evening, the girls had their first meeting in Room 703 of the Riot House as a party for Sinking Ship raged on in the next room over. Penny and Sapphire held court on the bed. At their feet on the floor sat Beth and a thin brunette they had found wandering the hall and looking lost. \"Okay. Meeting is in session.\" Sapphire giggled, lighting a cigarette, looking drunk on power and perhaps something more. The little brunette tentatively raised her hand. Penny raised a brow and nodded at her uncertainly. \"…yes?\" \"I'm a little bit confused…what kind of meeting is this?\" The girl said in a quiet, breathy voice. \"This….is the very first official meeting of the…wait, what name did we decide on?\" Penny looked to Sapphire in confusion. \"Umm…oh! The Band-Aids.\" Sapphire answered after mulling it over for a moment. \"Yeah! Yes, this is the first official meeting of the Band-Aids. Now, what's your name?\" Penny asked kindly, smiling at the girl who still looked confused. \"Jennifer Crews?\" The girl said, looking around as if she suspected they were playing a joke on her. \"Jennifer…honey, that sort of name will get you nowhere. You need something with some flash, some spice.\" Sapphire proclaimed passionately, leaning forward so far she nearly slid off the bed. \"Yeah! Maybe….\" Penny glanced quickly around the room for inspiration, her gaze landing on the Kolexia clock on the night-stand. \"I've got it! Polexia! Polexia Aphrodisia!\" The girl looked shocked but Sapphire and Beth cheered in approval. \"Okay, so as Band-Aids we agree that we can't act like the rest of the girls. We've got to be here for the music. We inspire the music. Without us, there is no music. We've got to take care of these guys, be like their wives and not just some girls they picked up on the road.\" Penny announced with a flourish. Beth was nodding as if Penny had just revealed the secrets of the universe but Polexia was looking more terrified than ever. \"I don't know if I'm cut out for this stuff…I mean, I don't think I'm really a groupie. I've never….been with a guy in a band.\" She confessed, avoiding the other girl's eyes. \"Well, what were you doing out there in the hallway?\" Sapphire asked huffily, stubbing out her cigarette on the bed's comforter. \"I…I was looking for Mark. You know, the bass player for Sinking Ship?\" \"Oh, well he's right next door! What did you plan on doing when you found him?\" Penny asked, sliding off the bed and sitting face-to-face with the girl. \"I don't know. I just wanted to meet him. He…he speaks to me.\" Polexia breathed, closing her eyes. Penny nodded, smiling knowingly. \"Want me to introduce you?\" Before Polexia could answer, a thunderous knock sounded at the door before it flew open, banging into the wall violently. \"Is Miss Penny Lane in by any chance?\" A familiar looking man with a velvet jacket and huge black sunglasses stumbled into the room, a crooked grin on his face. Penny felt her heart stop for just a moment before it resumed its regular rhythm. She launched herself off the floor and into his arms screaming, \"Keith!\" \"Ah, Penny darling. A little birdie told me you would be here.\"[Chapter 9] Keith: Back by popular demand. :) Anybody know who \"Sinking Ship\" is meant to be? A hint, it starts with a Led and ends with a Zeppelin. Ahh, two of my favorite bands all together. Sort of. Okay...on with the story. Keith laughed at Penny's gleeful squeal, sweeping her off her feet before staggering out the door like a pirate carting off his wench. Beth and Polexia stared after them with matching looks of surprise on their faces as Penny's laughter echoed down the hallway. Polexia turned to Sapphire with wide eyes, \"Was that who I thought it was?\" \"Keith? Yeah. They're old friends.\" Sapphire rolled her eyes, lurching off the bed and swaying on her feet before grabbing Polexia's wrist and dragging her to her feet. \"Come on, we're going over to the party.\" She told the girl as she headed out of the room and walked the short distance to the door next to theirs. Beth followed eagerly, but Polexia was white as a ghost. Sapphire ignored her protests, too focused on getting close to James again. How dare he reject her, how dare he laugh at her! The party was in full swing and the luxurious suite was already half-way destroyed. Lamps lay shattered on the floor, paintings hung crooked on the walls, bottles and cigarette butts littered the carpet, and it appeared that someone had set the fern in the corner on fire. Will was leaning out the window, laughing and yelling slurred obscenities at the passersby on the sidewalk below. James was in the corner, strumming his guitar and wearing a smirk that made it obvious that he had orchestrated the whole thing. Leon was nursing a glass of scotch and trying to ignore the dramatically underage blonde who kept stroking his hair. Mark was nowhere to be found. The room was full of other people who were either hangers-on or girls in varying degrees of undress who tried to keep their cool to hide how desperate they really were to get their hands on one of the boys in the band. Sapphire headed straight for James who looked amused to see her looking like such a mess. Beth thought better of joining the party and turned on her heel to find something better to do, leaving Polexia stranded in the doorway. \"So what are you doing here? I didn't know you were in town.\" Penny asked Keith around a mouthful of food. It was morning, or early afternoon, and Keith had ordered every breakfast item on the menu then spread it all out in between them on the bed. Penny smiled at him and stabbed another piece of scrambled egg with her fork. \"Passing through, darling. Just passing through. But I said to myself, I must stop and see my darling Penny Lane. It's been so long.\" He winked at her, taking a big bite out of his slice of toast. \"I'm glad you did.\" She winked back. \"So how have you been spending your time darling? I saw a picture of you in one of the gossip rags while I was in London.\" He informed her nonchalantly, taking a sip from his glass and climbing off the bed. Penny almost choked on her orange juice, looking incredulous. \"What! What kind of picture? What are you talking about?\" \"Oh it wasn't a big picture. Just of you getting in a car with that new band….Sinking Ship? Something like that. They identified you as an unknown blonde but I would have known that backside anywhere.\" He drawled, sliding on his pants and buttoning them. Penny sighed, flopping back on the pillows as she watched him with a smile. \"Now where is my shirt?\" Keith muttered, hands on hips as he looked around the room. When his gaze landed on Penny, he grinned. \"To hell with getting dressed.\" He chuckled, climbing over the rattling plates and uneaten food, right into her waiting arms as she giggled blissfully. All too soon, Penny was forced to kiss Keith goodbye as he rushed to the airport to catch a flight to New York, promising her all the while he would send for her. It wasn't the first time someone had told Penny that and she knew better than to sit around and wait for a call that would never come. As she drifted down the hallway, humming an old Stones song, she heard voices rising in a heated argument from Sinking Ship's room. Stopping in the doorway, she saw Will standing with Peter and Jay and a few hotel employees. He looked like a schoolboy being scolded, eyes downcast and trying to hide a smile. Looking up, Will caught sight of Penny and smiled sheepishly around Jay's massive body. Penny waved back, finally noticing the gaping hole in the wall and the smashed TV set that had obviously caused it as well as the rest of the destruction. No wonder he was in trouble. She swallowed her laughter and slipped quietly into her room. Inside, she found Sapphire sprawled across the bed in her clothes and shoes with a pillow clutched tightly over her face. Beth was on the other bed, painting her toenails a blinding shade of purple. Beyond them, Penny was surprised to see Polexia lounging on the balcony. \"She's still here?\" Penny whispered to Beth. Beth nodded, \"She spent the night with Mark. Just came in right before you. How was Keith?\" \"Perfect. As always.\" Penny grinned, climbing onto the bed beside Beth. \"What's wrong with Sapphire?\" She asked the redhead, who was intently slathering the purple goop on the nail of her big toe. \"Big fight with James. He laughed in her face and she threw a drink on him. Or so I heard.\" Beth whispered, glancing over her shoulder at the motionless form in the other bed. \"I did not throw a drink on him. I hit him with a bottle.\" Sapphire mumbled from beneath the pillow before rolling over, turning her back to the girls. Penny exchanged a weary look with Beth and stood up to go take a shower, still feeling too delighted to let Sapphire's dramatic evening ruin her good mood.[Chapter 10] One Year Later – 1972 \"Is this…Penny Lane?\" Penny sat down on her bed, phone in hand, and wondered who the beautifully smooth voice on the other end of the phone belonged to. \"Yes. Who is this?\" \"My name's Russell. I'm with a band called Stillwater. You've probably heard of us.\" Penny laughed until she realized he was serious. \"Oh, oh yeah. Um, I think I have.\" She had, but barely. Stillwater was hardly a blip on anyone's radar but she knew every up and coming band. It was her business. \"Good, good. Well listen, we're heading to California this weekend and we'd like you to come visit us. I'll leave you a pass at the door.\" He sounded so self-assured that she was tempted to just hang up on him, but something about his voice made her smile. \"Okay, that'll be great. Can you leave about four passes though?\" \"Yeah, no problem. You're bringing some friends?\" \"Yeah, they're great, you guys will love them.\" \"Good, good. It'll be on the eleventh. See you then.\" Penny nodded though she knew he couldn't see her. She knew it was time to hang up but she had just one more question. \"Wait! Do you mind telling me how you got this number?\" He paused for a minute before answering. \"Oh…yeah. Zane Roberts gave it to me, you know…the manager? Said if I was going to California I had to look you up. He said it just wouldn't be California without a little bit of Penny Lane.\" Penny laughed, \"Okay then. Well I'll see you soon Russell.\" \"Okay, so first things first. Don't let them know you're a huge fan of their music, even if you are. These guys are used to girls falling all over them and complimenting their work. If you don't, it's different and it'll stand out. That's the most important thing...to stand out and get noticed.\" The group of young girls in front of Penny nodded like bobble-heads, eyes wide with wonder at the words of their teacher. For a few months now Penny had been running a \"school\" for aspiring Band-Aids on the weekends at the Riot House. They would all gather up before the parties got really wild and Penny would let them in on a few of the most important secrets it had taken her years to learn. Sapphire couldn't understand why Penny wanted to help \"the competition\" and she would take no part of it. Penny wasn't entirely sure why she did it either, except that when she looked at these young girls with too much makeup who tried too hard…she saw what she would have been like three years ago without Sapphire's help. Someone needed to show these girls the ropes, if only for the greater good of rock and roll. \"How did you get noticed?\" One girl asked, her expression full of admiration. \"I don't know exactly what did it…it helps to be confident though. And my coat couldn't have hurt.\" Penny laughed, glancing at her now infamous green velvet fur-trimmed coat that lay crumpled on the bed behind her. The girl opened her mouth to ask another question but was silenced when Sapphire burst through the doorway, eyes wild and feathers flying. \"Penny! Did you forget what we were supposed to be doing tonight?\" She gasped for air, grasping the door frame for support. \"What? Calm down, what is it?\" Penny stood up, eyebrows knit in concern, crossing the room to fan her friend's sweaty forehead. \"Stillwater! We're late. They're probably already on stage.\" Sapphire sighed, ignoring the gasps of jealousy and awe from the \"students\". \"Oh my God, I completely forgot!\" Penny groaned. \"Go get Beth and Polexia, I'll meet you in the lobby.\" Sapphire hurried from the room and Penny turned to the girls who still sat patiently on the hotel room floor. \"Okay, class is dismissed. Umm…go have fun!\" She waved her hand in the air carelessly and took off down the hallway after Sapphire. Sapphire was right. By the time the girls reached the venue, Stillwater was already well into their performance. Luckily, Russell had remembered to leave four passes and they had no problem slipping through the back door. By the time the band filed off stage, Penny, Sapphire, Beth, and Polexia were waiting for them. The lead singer Jeff stepped into the room first, wiping the sweat off his forehead with a towel. The bass player Larry followed him, looking peaceful and somehow bland. Ed the drummer was next, silent but obviously pleased. The last man through the door was Russell and Penny felt her heart skip a beat. He was grinning from ear to ear, a grin that made Penny catch her breath. When he looked up and his eyes met her own, she felt herself melt inside. The part of her brain that was still functioning recognized that something bad was happening. This feeling was wrong. She shouldn't feel this much, shouldn't care this much. She was going to get hurt. But when he crossed the room and turned that charming smile on her, she mentally told herself to shut up and smiled back.[Chapter 11] \"Miss Penny Lane, I presume?\" Russell asked, taking Penny's hand and pressing his lips to it, eyes still locked on hers. Penny could only nod as sparks shot through her hand at his touch. He held her hand for a moment too long, smiling down at her. Penny couldn't help but smile back as the air buzzed around them. \"I would ask you to introduce your friends but I guess everybody's already getting acquainted.\" He chuckled, his gaze shifting to the scene behind her. Penny turned to find Sapphire already cozying up to Jeff on the couch, purring in his ear and running her fingers through his hair. Ed sat at her side, watching indifferently and munching on a bag of chips. Beth was lighting a joint to share with Larry and it was obvious that they were already engaged in some deep, meaningful conversation. Polexia had drifted to the far wall, watching Sapphire and Jeff with narrowed eyes and a mournful expression. A few stray groupies, obviously amateurs, lingered near the doorway whispering and staring. \"Looks that way. I guess that just leaves us.\" Penny laughed, turning back to find Russell's tall imposing frame just inches away from her. \"Guess so. Hey, you want to head over to the…Riot House? I hear there's always a party there.\" Russell asked, his fingers grazing the hem of Penny's shirt. Penny hesitated at his invitation. She knew she shouldn't go. This feeling in the pit of her stomach told her it would be a bad idea. It told her that Russell was bad news; he was someone she could get too attached to. She had every intention of saying no until she opened her mouth. \"Sure.\" \"Hey, have you ever seen the view of the Strip from one of them balconies?\" \"A few times.\" Penny swallowed her laughter, and nodded seriously. \"Oh…oh right. Well, I've got a great room there. Uhhh, maybe we can check it out after the party?\" Russell raised a brow, making every attempt to sound self-assured and sexy. Penny couldn't help but smile at his fumbling pick-up line. She could see now that Russell's cockiness was his way of hiding his insecurities. He was still young and pretty new on the scene; it was natural for him to be a little scared. \"Uh, maybe.\" She smiled reassuringly as he slid an arm around her waist and began to escort her from the room. \"Wait, what about everybody else? I hate to leave the girls…\" Penny stopped, looking back at her friends. Polexia had plopped herself down on the couch, still pouting, and had stolen Ed's chips. Fortunately, Ed had fallen asleep and wasn't bothered by this. Beth and Larry were passing the joint, talking animatedly about something that seemed to involve outer space. Sapphire and Jeff had long since disappeared behind closed doors. \"I think everybody will be alright without us.\" Russell laughed; nudging the arm of the sleepy looking man perched on a cooler. \"Dick, is the limo outside?\" Dick the manager looked up slowly, his expression hesitant. \"Well…Russell…the driver had an emergency…\" \"What the hell kind of emergency are we talking about, Dick? Where is my limo?\" Russell dropped Penny's hand and crossed his arms. \"Well…\" \"Dick!\" \"He had to go pick up Sabbath at the airport.\" Dick admitted, taking a swig from his beer. Russell cursed in outrage, looking more embarrassed than angry. \"How the hell are we supposed to get to the Riot House then?\" He asked with false tranquility, motioning to Penny behind him with a nod of his head. \"Don't worry, don't worry. It's all taken care of. I've borrowed Tim's car and I'll drive you two there now.\" Dick rose to his feet, looking a bit unsteady and belching loudly. Penny glanced uncertainly up at Russell who shrugged and wrapped his arm around her shoulders as Dick led them out to the parking lot. He stopped in front of a sky blue 1969 Datsun and struggled to open the door. Russell and Penny stared at the car with matching expressions of revulsion. \"You're kidding me.\" Russell said, an almost pleading note to his voice, still staring at the car. \"Nope. Your chariot awaits.\" Dick chuckled, sliding behind the wheel. By the time that they reached the Riot House, the party was in full swing. The crowd in the lobby was spilling out onto the sidewalk and a few tour buses hummed out front. Dick deposited them onto the sidewalk and then puttered off back to the venue to return the car. Russell was clutching Penny's hand, staring silently and apprehensively at the feral crowd. Penny wondered if he was worried that he'd be mobbed or that no one would recognize him. \"Don't let go of my hand.\" He whispered loudly in her ear, squeezing her hand as they set off wading through the front door. A few people seemed to recognize Russell and patted him on the back, congratulating him on a good show. Russell beamed under all the attention, his confidence restored. Penny just smiled quietly, letting him have his moment. It was slightly quieter and more civilized inside the hotel. Russell led Penny to the bar and ordered them both a drink, always keeping one eye on the people around him. Penny smiled, watching him as he sipped his drink awkwardly, scanning the room as if hoping to be recognized again. She wanted to assure him that all the fame would come soon enough but she didn't get the chance. \"Russell! How are you?\" A short, flamboyant man was vigorously shaking Russell's hand and praising the band to no end. Russell obviously didn't recognize him but played along and soon they were lost in conversation. Sighing, Penny leaned back against the bar and downed the rest of her drink. A familiar face caught her eye and she noticed Don Wilson strolling by. She had accompanied his former band when they were on their final tour, taking their last gasping breaths. It had been a miserable experience; bands were always so much more fun on their way up. But Don had always been a sweetheart. She stood up a little straighter and smiled her brightest smile. That seemed to get Don's attention. He winked and Penny blew him a kiss, all while Russell continued blabbering about his favorite brand of guitar picks. Don looked as if he wanted to come over and say hello but his companion didn't appear to think it was a good idea. Penny recognized the girl; she had seen her around plenty of times. She was barely 14, with wild bleached hair, too much makeup, high platforms, and a weird name like Star or Moon. The girl was glaring daggers at Penny from across the room, her arm wove possessively through Don's. Penny raised a brow but chose to ignore it, sliding her own hand back into Russell's. The minutes passed on, seeming like hours. A small crowd of instrument enthusiasts had gathered around Russell and it seemed like the conversation would never end. Penny was lost in daydreams, wondering about what the rest of the night would bring (if they ever left the bar) and what the girls were doing back at the venue. \"Don't ever think about looking at my man again or you'll pay.\" A nasty hiss shattered Penny's peaceful reverie. She looked up to find Don's blonde friend and her equally underage brunette companion standing in front of her with ferocious expressions on their pre-pubescent faces. Before Penny could react, Star tossed her full glass of red wine down the front of Penny's perfect white dress. Penny gasped as the cold liquid hit her, seeping into the fabric until it resembled a ghastly wound. The two girls giggled, linking arms and strutting away as Penny stood dripping in their wake.[Chapter 12] Aww, thanks for the sweet reviews and for coming back to read the next chapter! :) This is still the year before the movie takes place but that is coming up very soon! Penny could only stand and stare at the retreating girls in disbelief, she was too shocked to be angry. Russell finally noticed something was wrong and turned to her, his eyes widening as he took in the ever-expanding seeping stain on her dress. He met her eyes in surprise. \"Uhhh, did you…spill your drink?\" He looked confused, obviously he had missed Star's little outburst. Penny was too embarrassed to tell him the truth so she just nodded, feeling a stinging sensation beginning behind her eyes. Oh God, she would not cry in front of all these people. She glanced up to find Russell and the rest of the men looking around uncomfortably. Swallowing hard, she pulled herself together. \"Would you mind if we went up to your room now?\" Penny managed to flash her brightest smile, placing her hand on Russell's arm to make sure he got the message. The charming side of Russell returned and he chuckled, taking Penny's hand and leading her through the crowd. As they waded through the waves of bodies Penny spotted Star and her friend lounging against the wall, watching her leave with smug satisfaction on their obnoxiously made-up little faces. The next morning, Penny awoke to an ear-splitting clanging noise that seemed to bounce off her skull with all the intensity of an enraged drummer. Her first few seconds of consciousness were shrouded in confusion. Where was she? Why was the sunlight so bright? Who was snoring beside her? What the hell was that noise? Finally she realized it was the phone on the night-table. Reluctant to emerge from her cozy cocoon, she slipped one hand out from under the sheets and felt around until she hit cold metal. Putting the phone to ear she muttered a groggy \"hello\". \" Hell-o?\" A rather unpleasant, indignant, and nasally sounding female voice was on the other end. Before Penny could answer, Russell shot straight up out of the bed and ripped the phone from Penny's hand, his expression stricken. \"Hello? Leslie, is that you? Hello?\" Penny watched him press his lips tight against the phone, turning his back on her. She frowned and ducked under the phone cord, climbing out of the bed. It no longer felt so warm and welcoming. Picking up her irreparably stained dress, she tried to catch Russell's eye, whispering his name quietly as she slipped her clothes back on. He whirled around, phone still clutched tightly against his ear, and she could hear the girl on the other end still whining endlessly. Russell's face was a mask of irritation as he shushed her like she was an annoying child and waved her away dismissively. Penny could feel her heart sinking like a lead balloon as Russell turned his back on her again and continued to soothe the girl on the phone. Penny swallowed hard, stuck her chin in the air with dignity, then turned on her heel and stormed out into the hallway. But not before slamming the door behind her for good measure. Penny felt all mixed up inside, like all her emotions were jumbled into one big confusing heap. Why had she ignored her instinct? Why had she answered the phone? Why did she care so much? \"Penny! Wait!\" Penny stopped in her tracks as she heard Russell's pleading voice. Spinning around, she watched him jumping down the hallway on one foot, trying to pull his jeans up. \"Penny, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to treat you like that…it's just…she's my ex and she don't realize it's over!\" Russell's voice was unsteady as he hopped along, practically shaking the wood-paneled walls. Before he could reach her, he stumbled over his pants leg and hit the floor with a resounding crash. Without thinking, Penny hurried over, helping him sit up. \"Poor baby! Are you okay? Did you hit your head?\" She knelt in front of him, pushing up his floppy hair to check for any head injuries. Russell clutched his head, looking pathetic, \"I think so…it really hurts.\" \"You poor thing!\" Penny exclaimed, pressing a kiss on his forehead and cradling him in her arms. Deep down she knew he wasn't really hurt. And she also knew he was probably lying about Leslie. But she was just crazy enough not to care. Someone cleared their throat awkwardly and Penny glanced up to find Pete Townshend trying to squeeze past them in the hallway. He glanced down at Russell with his pants at his ankles and Penny with her bedraggled clothing and just shook his head as if it wasn't the strangest thing he had seen that morning. Which, considering that they were at the Riot House, it was probably a fairly tame scene. \"Penny…would…would you come on the tour with me? It's just for the rest of the summer.\" Russell asked suddenly, looking up at her with wide and hopeful eyes. Penny was surprised. But one look at Russell and she knew what her answer would be. So she just smiled and helped him off the ground.[Chapter 13] Sorry this has taken so long! I've just been waiting around for inspiration and it's finally arrived! For the next chapter I'm going to skip ahead to 1973, when the movie takes place. :) The Stillwater tour of 1972 was a whirlwind of cheap hotels, cheaper gigs, and the cheapest booze on the shelves. The band had yet to acquire a significant fan base but the fans they did have were rabid and loyal. They turned out at every show in droves, cheering the band on and packing the tiny venues. Though she had been hurt by his behavior, Penny stuck by Russell's side. It wasn't hard for her to see that he was just a child, deep down. He needed to be taken care of. When he got hurt, he needed someone there to kiss it better. When he was sad, he needed someone to hold his hand and tell him everything was going to be okay. When he was happy, he needed someone there to give him a hug and celebrate with him. And since the ever-mysterious Leslie wasn't around, Penny figured it was her job to encourage Russell. Of course, Leslie hadn't exactly disappeared. Penny wasn't allowed to touch the phone in Russell's room. Whenever she called, Penny had to sit in complete silence while Russell breathed into the phone, listening to a shrill voice on the other end. His conversations weren't exactly sticky sweet or full of loving endearments, but he ended every one of them with a soft \"I love you\". Penny took solace in the fact that he looked at her each time he said it. She stood by as the fans lavished him with attention. She soothed him when he lost his temper and repeatedly prevented him from breaking up the band. She suffered hours upon hours in tense silence as he racked his brain in dingy hotel rooms all across the United States, trying to write new material for the next album. But it was all worth it when he came to her all jittery and excited one day. He sat her down and stared straight through her eyes and into her soul as he played a song he'd written, strumming his guitar lovingly and murmuring the words softly in a hesitant voice. If Penny hadn't been captivated by him before, she was definitely a goner now. She enjoyed each stop of the way, standing just off stage and learning the words to each and every song so well that they still played in her head long after she laid down at night, wrapped in the arms of her very own guitar god. In San Antonio, Russell brought Penny a turquoise ring from a street vendor just outside the hotel while they were all waiting for their luggage to be loaded on to the bus. The band gathered around as he jokingly dropped to his knee and slid it on to her finger, smiling up at her with a wicked twinkle in his eyes. While the guys applauded zealously, Russell climbed to his feet and threw his arm fondly around Penny. She managed to laugh and vamp it up for her audience, but her heart had practically stopped. She felt hot tears spring to her eyes as she wondered why Leslie had gotten a real proposal with a big diamond while the best she could hope for was another joke. Eventually the party had to end and Penny found herself dumped unceremoniously on a street corner in Kansas as the band prepared to head back to Michigan and she readied herself to head back to San Diego. \"Sorry to leave you here, love, but we're going one way and you're going another. This is the closest we're gonna be to California.\" Dick apologized as he sat her two suitcases and her tackle box purse on the sidewalk beside her. Russell was studying her face, so Penny smiled and nodded. \"It's fine, I can get myself home. Don't you worry about me.\" \"I have faith in you, darling. It was a great time. You're a blessing on the road.\" Dick grinned and kissed her cheek, tipping his hat as he disappeared onto the bus, leaving her alone with Russell. \"You sure you're gonna be okay?\" Russell asked one last time, grabbing her hand and squeezing it. Penny nodded again, holding onto her smile as she looked up into his face. He kissed her lips and then he pressed a kiss on her forehead before climbing onto the idling bus, calling over his shoulder that he would call her soon. She managed to keep up her cheerful façade as she waved them off, watching good old Doris chug off down the highway until it was out of sight. Only then did she allow the tears to start creeping down her cheeks. It took her awhile to get back home, but after some struggling and persuading she finally made it. All she could think about was taking a shower in her own bathroom and washing away the imprints that the tour had left behind. Unfortunately, there was no rest for the weary because all the girls were just dying to hear how the tour had been. So as soon as she'd left her things at her apartment, she met Sapphire and the girls at the Riot House. Even at 4 in the afternoon, the hotel was raucous. It took Penny half an hour to get through the lobby. Roadies and tour managers for various bands practically surrounded her, informing her that so-and-so was upstairs in room such-and-such and he would just be delighted to see her again. Penny brushed them off graciously, rushing for the stairs because she didn't want to get trapped in the elevator with them. It was a world away from her earliest trips to the Riot. Everyone was waiting in room 703. Sapphire was cramming her mouth full of Twinkies from the miniature fridge, Beth was studying what appeared to be an astrological chart, and Polexia was peering into a hand-held mirror, trying on lipstick in a particularly horrible shade of plum. Besides them, Penny's \"student's\" were crowded on the floor, eyeing Sapphire warily. Penny noticed that they had multiplied since their last session. As soon as Penny stepped into the room, a wall of chattery voices hit her, instantly making her brain ache. \"How was it?\" \"Russell is such a god, what was he like?\" \"Did Jeff mention me?\" \"Why did it take so long for you to get home?\" \"How were the shows?\" \"Was Russell nice?\" \"Can you introduce me to Ed?\" So Penny sat down and rehashed the whole experience for her apprentices, leaving out the worst parts and skipping over the topic of Leslie all together. When she had answered all their questions about Russell, she sent them on their way so she could have a real heart-to-heart with the other Band-Aids. She was bored with playing teacher already. Maybe Band-Aid school wasn't such a great idea. Or maybe she was just feeling particularly disillusioned today. She went over the story again, this time leaving nothing out. The girls were horrified that she'd been left alone in Kansas and were particularly bothered by the Leslie situation. \"You know, I've had enough! No one cares, no one! I'm sick of being used and treated like I'm nothing when all I do is try to help people. Nobody cares, and you can't make them care no matter what you do!\" Penny fumed, pacing back and forth across the room. She stopped for a moment, reveling in the relative silence, and looked at the rapt faces of her friends. \"I've made a decision. I'm going to retire.\"[Chapter 14] It is now 1973 and the beginning of the movie. I obviously won't be covering every moment and will be skipping what you have already seen in the movie for the most part to tell the \"behind the scenes\" story. Sorry it's been so long but I've not forgotten IWTB! Thanks for reading. The sun had just set when Penny Lane arrived at the San Diego Sports Arena. She waited alone on the ramp, just soaking up the calm before the storm as she watched a few familiar roadies milling around. One of the guys from the Stillwater road crew strolled over and enveloped her in a bone-crushing hug, grabbing her ass for good measure before he let her go. \"I knew you'd be here.\" He chuckled when he released her. \"You know the band is gonna be staying at the Hyatt in Los Angeles while we're out here. You gonna be around?\" Penny just smiled, shrugging her shoulders and trying to maintain an air of mystery, \"I don't know, I might be busy. I'm going to be moving to London soon.\" He just laughed; he was used to her fanciful proclamations. She watched him wander away, pulling herself up to sit on the low concrete wall where she had a good view of the parking lot. Fans were starting to arrive, milling around the cars and lighting up joints. The lights were starting to come on around her, making her seat in the shadows seem even darker. As she watched, a noisy old car rolled up and stopped just under a streetlight a few yards away from Penny. She watched two demure young girls, a brunette and a redhead, climb out and wave goodbye to the middle-aged driver. As soon as the car was out of sight they scrambled into the shadows of the building with their bulging handbags, rustling around, giggling and cussing. When they re-emerged, it was in microscopic outfits, towering heels, and heavy makeup that seemed more suited to girls a decade older. Penny sighed, watching this new breed of groupie flounce down the ramp. They were all so young, just barely into their teens. And they were all so sharp, with their pointy elbows, knobby knees, jutting hip-bones, and tongues like razorblades. They made her feel old and worn out, like a dress that had seen better days. \"Hey, aren't you Penny Lane?\" Penny sighed, noticing that the girls had stopped right in front of her with their hands on their hips and a sour look on their acne-marred faces. \"Yeah?\" Penny answered uncertainly, the incident with the wine-stained dress still fresh in her mind. \"Oh. Star wants you to know that if you mess with Marc Bolan she's gonna get you. He's hers.\" The brunette reported, raising one a brow as if daring Penny to challenge her. \"Well, you tell your little friend Star that she can have Marc. I finished with him ages ago. He's old news.\" Penny rolled her eyes as they cackled, making jokes about how incredibly old she was as they lurched away in their dangerously spiky heels. They knocked impatiently on the door, whining and screeching until Freddy opened it. He smirked to see them standing there in next-to-nothing and immediately ushered them in, catching sight of Penny in the process. He smiled and waved her in but she just smiled and shook her head, looking away until she heard the door click closed. She wasn't even sure if she wanted to go backstage. She knew she shouldn't be here in the first place but she just couldn't resist. She was drawn here like a moth to the flame. She would never admit it but her retirement had been a complete failure. If anything she was spending more time backstage, trying to put the past out of her mind. Russell hadn't called her in months but even so, she'd fully expected him to call and leave a pass for the San Diego show when he got into town. But the day had passed with no call. The phone had rang more than once and she'd lunged for it each time, only to be disappointed when it was just Estrella or the boys from Sabbath calling for Sapphire. But even though she hadn't gotten that call, she'd still went through the old routine and gotten herself all fixed up to come down to the show. If nothing else, she could flirt with Ozzy a little and maybe make Russell jealous. She didn't care, he was nothing to her. Nothing at all. That had become her mantra, she repeated it in her mind all the time. She wasn't into attachments, just the music. \"Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes…\" trilled a decidedly dizzy voice from behind, bringing Penny back into reality. She turned to find Estrella spinning towards her in a whirlwind of blonde hair and dangling red sleeves, her heavy boots clomping across the pavement. \"Estrella! I didn't know you were coming!\" Penny called out, sliding off the wall to hug her friend. \"I wasn't going to but Keith and Roger had this huge fight and I just had to get away. Such a bad atmosphere, you know? Why are you out here? Didn't Russell leave a pass for you?\" Estrella asked, reaching up to straighten her headband. \"Uh, I just didn't feel like going in yet. Have you seen Polexia?\" \"Not lately…last I heard she was holed up with Ian at the Riot House. Said she was in love.\" Estrella rolled her eyes at this, never having been one to romanticize what they all did. \"Of course she is. Well, I think Sapphire is probably going to be coming with Sabbath and the last time I heard from Beth, she was hitch-hiking her way across the country to find herself.\" Penny laughed, scuffing the toe of her boot across the pavement. \"She's officially lost it.\" Estrella groaned. Just then, two other girls arrived. They were graduates of the now-defunct School for Band-Aids so Penny felt obligated to talk to them even though they were annoying. Estrella lingered a few feet away, never one for social pretense, dancing to a beat only she could hear. Penny was bored enough with the conversation that she took notice when a young guy strolled up with his notebook and little messenger bag strapped across his chest. She listened to his awkward exchange with Freddy at the door, and chastised the other girls for giggling at his misfortune. He was just a kid after all, earnest and unaware of how this world worked. They chatted for a moment and she learned he was a journalist who blushed every time she smiled at him. She even lectured him on the hated \"g-word\" before Polexia arrived. Then everything started moving too fast. Sapphire arrived soon after with Sabbath, bearing a fistful of passes and a bottle of Jack Daniels. She tried to get the kid in but Freddy wasn't having it. So she left him at the door, looking like an abandoned puppy, after promising to get him a pass. A promise she quickly forgot as Ozzy swept her into his arms and ran away with her, laughing like a madman.[Chapter 15] Early the next morning, the ringing phone dragged Penny from the depths of slumber. She sat up and grabbed it with a clatter, cursing whoever might be calling at this ungodly hour. \"Hello.\" She grumbled into the receiver. No one spoke for a few long seconds, and then someone awkwardly cleared their throat on the other end and asked, \"Is this-is this Penny Lane?\" \"Who is this?\" She asked, slumping back onto her pillow. \"This is William Miller, we met last night? I write for Cream magazine…\" She closed her eyes, head pounding, \"William, how did you get this number?\" \"You gave it to me.\" He sounded hurt. Then it all came rushing back. The night before…meeting William…who had gotten in with Stillwater. Russell, holding her hand in his and staring into her eyes like he knew every single thought that passed through her brain as she looked up at him. His calloused fingers brushing against her skin as he pushed a lock of hair from her eyes. The show, where he was on fire and she was lost in his music, knowing he was playing for her. After, when she fled the stage and hid in Sabbath's band room like a coward until they were gone. Then, when she finally emerged, William dutifully reporting Russell's message to her. Oh, God. \"Oh, right. Sorry, I'm not used to being up this early. How are you, William?\" \"I didn't mean to wake you…it's after two p.m.\" \"Oh.\" She glanced at the clock on her bedside table and confirmed he was right. \"It was a long night.\" \"Oh.\" \"Well, did you enjoy the show last night?\" She asked, struggling to find something to talk about when all she wanted to do was hide under the covers and obsess over every moment with Russell. \"Yeah, it was great. Really great. Are you going to the Riot House tonight?\" He finally blurted out, revealing the real reason he had called. He wanted to check out the Riot House. She wasn't surprised but the poor kid really didn't know what he was in for. The gears slowly began turning in her head… \"Well, I wasn't planning on it. Why? Do you need to talk to Stillwater again for your story?\" She answered carefully, sitting up on her bed. \"Well, yeah, but if you're not going…\" She cut him off, \"No, it's no problem. I can take you if you need to go.\" She heard him breathe a sigh of relief, \"Okay, okay, that would be great. What time?\" \"Well, I like to make a fashionably late entrance and it doesn't really get to rocking until after midnight. So…\" \"I have to be home by midnight. My mom will be waiting up for me.\" He sounded embarrassed. \"Oh, right. Yeah. Well, we can go early then. I'll pick you up in a few hours.\" Even though they were early, the Riot House was packed and Stillwater's small party was in full swing. She had made her entrance and then found a seat where Russell would have a perfect view of her because she knew he'd be watching. She was studiously ignoring him, running her fingers up and down her warm glass of beer and halfway chatting to the Alice Cooper roadie who had followed her up from the lobby. Polexia was occupying William who looked stunned but seemed to be taking notes with his eyes. \"So are you going on the road with Stillwater? If you're not, you should come with us.\" Alice's roadie was fiddling with the fur trim on her coat and it was starting to get on her nerves. She just shrugged and smiled in a way she hoped was mysterious; keeping an eye on Russell whom she could see was watching her intently. \"Come on, that's not an answer.\" The roadie kneeled down beside her chair and grinned at her. \"Has good old Russ not invited you or something?\" She shrugged again, still smiling even though he was really getting under her skin now. \"Well, maybe he's been too caught up in reconciling with his ex-wife.\" Her eyes snapped back to him, giving him the reaction he'd obviously wanted, \"What did you say?\" \"Oh, you didn't know he was back with that Leslie bitch? I thought everybody knew. She's got a rock the size of Texas on her bony little finger.\" She couldn't help but look at Russell, who couldn't hear their conversation but was still watching. He raised a brow at her hurt expression and dropped his eyes to the guitar in his lap. The roadie followed her gaze and chuckled. \"Oh, sweet Penny. Forget Stillwater and come with us. We're on the third floor.\" He patted her knee and stood up, waved goodbye to Dick, then headed off back to his own party. She sat there for a moment in stunned silence, staring at the glass in her hands. She wished that she wanted to smash it against Russell's head but all she wanted was for him to want her instead of his ex-wife. When she looked up and caught him staring again, she automatically smiled at him. Forget Leslie, it was time to put her plan in action. She drained the glass and stood. \"I need ice…\" Driving William home that night, she kept her eyes on the road and he kept his eyes on her. They hadn't spoken much since he started banging on the ice room door around 11 p.m. and demanding she come out and take him home before his mother called the police out to look for him. Russell had rolled his eyes and kept her pinned beneath him on the grimy cold tile. Ordinarily, that would have been fine with her but the rising panic in William's voice had pushed her into action. \"Come on Russell, let me up.\" She pushed at his chest and he finally rolled off her with a groan. \"You're already leaving?\" He climbed to his feet and helped her up before feeling around in the dark for his shirt. \"Yeah, I have to get him home.\" She winked and kissed his cheek. \"See you later.\" \"You coming by tomorrow?\" \"Not tomorrow, I've got plans.\" She lied through a big smile, playing hard to get. \"The next day then.\" \"We'll see.\" \"What about the tour? You're coming right? Don't forget.\" He tossed Penny her coat and buttoned his shirt. She didn't answer; she just pushed open the door and blew him a kiss over her shoulder. He was still standing there in the dark when she turned away and left with William. Now they were almost back to San Diego and her mind was still racing. She had known before she went to the Riot House that he would invite her on the tour and she had known she would, but now it was reality and she was scared…and happy…and all mixed up inside. William's voice broke into her daydream just in time for her to slam on her brakes at a stop sign. \"Don't forget, I live on Mockingbird Street.\" \"I know, I know.\" Penny smiled over at him and that was all the encouragement he seemed to need. \"What happened in the ice room? You were in there all night. People had to go downstairs and drag up a bucket of ice.\" She laughed at that but didn't reply. \"You left me.\" He blurted out accusingly. Glancing at him in surprise, she put on her blinker and turned onto his street, \"I'm sorry. I thought you'd be talking to the band.\" \"I couldn't. Russell was with you. And Jeff disappeared with Polexia. And Ed wouldn't talk. And Larry was too high. So I talked to Vic, the Zeppelin fan. I can't write about him.\" \"Why not? He'd make for a good story.\" She smiled and pulled to a stop in front of his house. He sighed and climbed out of the car. \"Thanks anyway…for taking me.\" \"William.\" She waited until he leaned back in the door. \"I'm sorry I left you. Don't be mad. I won't leave you when we get to Morocco.\" He looked surprised, but then his lips curled into an ear-to-ear smile. She waved goodbye as he closed the door and ran to his house, where all the lights were still blazing.[Chapter 16] Penny had every intention of staying home the next day. She was not going to the Riot House. Definitely not. \"Come on, Penny. Everybody is going to be there. You know you want to!\" Sapphire prodded as she was fixing her hair. She was right; Saturday night at the Riot House was bound to be crazy. \"You know I can't. I told Russell I had plans. I can't show up now, that would look desperate.\" Penny was lounging on Sapphire's bed, browsing through her well-stocked makeup case. \"No it won't. Not if you're there with somebody else. Go see your old friend.\" Penny glanced up, \"What old friend?\" \"Didn't I tell you?\" She turned and looked at Penny who was frowning at her. \"Oh, shit. I guess I forgot.\" \"Tell me what? Tell me!\" Penny jumped off the bed. \"He called for you yesterday when you were in the shower. I think he said they were in town for a few days and he's staying at the Riot House. He said you should come see him.\" She said absent-mindedly, still working on her hair. Penny felt giddy enough to jump up and down on the bed. She always loved seeing him and he would be the perfect excuse to be at the Riot House. Sapphire was still talking when Penny dashed from the room to find something fabulous to wear. The fifth floor was the only floor that wasn't littered with empty bottles and passed out party-goers. It seemed strange to walk down a Riot House hallway without stumbling over someone or stepping in someone else's bodily secretions. Penny stopped in front of room 521 and knocked three times then flattened herself against the wall where she couldn't be seen through the peephole. The door was cracked open and a husky voice called out \"Hello?\" She waited. The door opened wider and then Keith stuck his head out, looking down the hallway. He turned to look the other way and finally caught sight of her, breaking into a wide grin. \"Ah, the one and only Miss Penny Lane. Come here, darling.\" She wrapped her arms around Keith and they stepped into the room. \"It seems so quiet up here, Keith. Are you the only one staying on this floor?\" \"I rented the whole floor. You know I love the atmosphere here but I get sick of people knocking on my door at all hours of the day when I'm trying to get some sleep.\" He chuckled and poured her a drink, then sat beside her. \"So what's been happening in your life, darling?\" \"Well, not much. I'm retired, you know.\" She announced grandly, watching for his reaction from the corner of her eye. He snorted in a very ungentlemanly way and almost spat out his drink. \"Retired? Oh, darling, no.\" \"What?\" She asked, offended by his attitude. \"I am! I have to...\" She trailed off, taking a gulp of the rather strong drink he'd fixed for her. \"Why is that?\" \"I just have to. I can't do this forever.\" She dropped her gaze to the bed, tracing the floral design with her fingernail. \"Why now? What's happened?\" He asked softly, tugging a lock of her hair until she looked up at him. \"Did you...did you fall for someone?\" Her sad smile gave her away and he nodded, \"Ah, I knew it. Who was it? Anyone I know?\" \"I doubt it. They're great but they haven't really hit it big yet. He's…\" She stopped again. \"He's what? Does he love you too?\" \"I don't know, I don't even know if I love him. You know I don't believe in attachments. It's just about the music.\" She tried to pull the mask back on but he wasn't having it. \"Well, that's very admirable darling but you're still human. What did this young man do that made you decide it was time to retire?\" Keith lit a cigarette and blew the smoke over her head, still watching her try to work through what she was feeling. \"I can't explain it but I just know I have to. This is my last time.\" She smiled at him, ready to change the subject but he wouldn't drop it. \"You'll never be able to retire, darling. You can't escape it, it's in your blood, and it's a part of you. You'll never be able to listen to a song on the radio without thinking of how it felt to spend the night in the bed of the man singing it. You'll never be able to go to a show without remembering how much better the music sounds from backstage. You'll never be able to go to a record store without seeing all your old friends staring up at you from the album covers. You are the music, love, and it's not going to let you go so you might as well forget that.\" She looked at him in surprise and he grinned and continued, \"Now me, on the other hand, I'll have no problem with it. We'll be retiring ourselves in a few years, you know. You won't see us on stage when we're old and gray. I'll get away from it all and go somewhere where nobody knows my name. Somewhere warm, on a beach where I'll lie in a hammock all day and drink copious amounts of alcohol from glasses with tiny umbrellas.\" She smiled but couldn't join him in laughter, \"It's more than just him, Keith. It's just…I feel like it's all falling apart. Things are changing, the people are changing. It's not how it used to be. I just feel like we're at the end of something, it's not beautiful and innocent anymore and it scares me sometimes.\" He took a thoughtful drag from his cigarette and said, \"I know what you mean, love. I know what you mean. Well, you give it a try. See if you can get away. Maybe you should go somewhere far away and live another life and see how you like it. You'll always have your memories and the music, you know. And maybe we'll run into each other on that beach one day and make love in the sand.\" She felt a lump in her throat at that and leaned over to kiss him on the cheek, \"Thank you.\" \"Anytime, darling. Now go on, I know you have somewhere you'd like to be.\" She stood but then stopped at the door, \"I don't want you to be all by yourself up here. It's so lonely...\" He rolled his eyes, \"Darling, you do know who I am don't you? I do have other friends in Los Angeles.\" Since she was already around, Penny decided it would be fine to make an appearance at Stillwater's suite. She could hear the music as soon as she stepped off the elevator and when she walked in, she saw Russell standing on the coffee table, trashing on his guitar like a man possessed. He didn't even notice her entrance so she leaned against the doorway, watching him with a smile. \"He's been like this all night.\" Sapphire said as she immediately made her way to Penny's side. \"What's his problem?\" \"I told him where you were.\" Sapphire smiled devilishly. \"So?\" Penny looked back at him and winced as he nearly fell off the table. \"I don't think he liked the idea of you being with someone else, especially someone more famous than him. But what do I know?\" She raised her eyebrows and waved goodbye to Penny as Dick took her hand and led her away. Penny watched her friend's exit with an amused expression until someone loomed in front of her, swaying unsteadily. \"Pen-Penny, you're here! You're here.\" Russell's boozy breath was hot on her face as he leaned in for a sloppy kiss. She turned her head and his wet lips landed on her cheek. Off balance, he stumbled against her and almost knocked her into the hallway. Sighing, she supported as much of his weight as she could. \"Come on Russell, help me out here. Stand up, come on, let's get you to bed.\" She wrapped her arm around him, allowing him to lean on her as she helped him towards the suite's bedroom. She threw open the door with a bang to find Sapphire and Dick entangled on the bed. Their bare white skin was nearly blinding in the moonlight that filtered through the open window. \"Try the other bedroom.\" Dick mumbled, waving them away from his position beneath Sapphire. \"You try the other bedroom. Russell needs to lie down.\" As she spoke, Russell stumbled from her grasp and collapsed on the bed with a grunt next to the couple. Sapphire quieted Dick and they gathered their clothing before slipping out of the room. Penny pulled off Russell's boots and placed them neatly beside the bed, then rolled him onto his back and struggled to remove his shirt. She folded it carefully then turned to look at him, sleeping like a baby. She started towards the door but stopped, then took off her coat instead and crawled into bed next to him. Snuggling next to his side, she listened to his steady breathing until she fell asleep.[Chapter 17] Penny was trying to figure out what \"packing light\" meant when the phone rang. It was the day before she was supposed to leave for the Stillwater tour so she expected, or at least wanted, it to be Russell calling. \"Hellooo…\" She answered playfully. \"Um, hello. It's William. You know, from the…\" \"I know who you are William. What's happening?\" She laughed at his endearing awkwardness as he cleared his throat on the other end of the line. \"Um, it's all happening I guess? I'm going on tour with Stillwater!\" His voice was practically trembling with barely contained excitement. \"Really? Wow! How did that happen?\" She twirled the phone line around her finger. \"Rolling Stone wants me to do a piece on the band!\" He sounded jittery; she could picture him pacing back and forth with the phone pressed tight against his ear. \"Rolling Stone? That's great! We're going to have so much fun!\" He paused, and then replied \"We? You-you're coming too?\" \"Yeah, everybody is going. It's all happening; we're going to see the world! You just wait until we get to Cleveland. You want to meet Bowie?\" She was already fantasizing about how wonderful everything was going to be. \"I'm not coming to Cleveland. I can only go for a few days.\" \"Why?\" She couldn't possibly imagine why anyone would leave a tour early. \"Um, school stuff. You know.\" Now he sounded nervous. She just laughed. \"We'll see about that.\" The afternoon sun was blinding when Penny exited the hotel behind Russell. He climbed right onto the waiting bus but she stuck around outside, waiting for everyone else to arrive. Russell had been in such a mood all day; he was really struggling to write new material for their next album. She'd sat around all morning, quietly watching him tapping a pencil on his notepad, so she was relieved that she would soon have some company. \"It's all happening!\" Polexia called out as she came towards Penny, arm-in-arm with Jeff. Penny waited until Jeff was on the bus before she whispered to Polexia, \"How are things going between you two?\" \"Great! He's so amazing, really.\" She clutched her chest, looking dreamily off into the sun. Penny sighed, not wanting to rain on her friend's parade, \"That's good. Just…just be careful.\" \"He's different, Penny. Really he is. We connect on this cosmic level.\" Before Penny could reply she spotted William striding down the sidewalk towards them. \"William!\" She stood on her toes and waved, flashing him a bright smile. His whole face lit up when he spotted her and he hurried over. \"Opie's coming?\" Polexia looked at Penny in surprise and Penny frowned at her. \"His name is William. And yes, he's coming. He's writing a piece on the band for Rolling Stone .\" She added, making sure to afford the prestigious magazine just the right amount of gravitas. Polexia raised her eyebrows, obviously impressed. He stood before them, looking uncertain and clutching his blue duffel bag like it was his lifeline. Penny smiled as Polexia said hello, then leaned over and kissed him on his furiously blushing cheek. \"Come on, William. Leave your bag here.\" Penny told him as she turned to board the bus. \"The Enemy!\" Jeff called as William followed the girls onto the bus, causing everyone to turn to look at him. \"Aww, don't call him that! His name is William!\" Penny protested, smiling back at him as she weaved her way between the seats. She paused beside Russell but he didn't look up from his guitar. Still brooding. So she continued on and chose her own seat, a few feet behind him. William looked as if he wanted to sit beside her but he hurried on past and sat alone on the opposite side of the bus where he appeared to be keeping a close eye on his bag through the window. Penny could hardly sit still; she was riding a wave of pure giddy excitement and felt like champagne bubbles were fizzing through her whole body. It would seem like she would tire of this, or at least grow jaded after so many years. But she hadn't, it still felt like the greatest thing ever to be going on tour with a band she loved. Ahead of her, Russell strummed the intro to Led Zeppelin's \"Going to California\", which he knew was her favorite Zeppelin song. She took that as a good sign and leaned back to relax as the beautiful music floated down the aisle. Jeff started singing from his seat beside Russell and Penny joined in softly as the rest of the band and the roadies filed in. \"Someone told me there's a girl out there, with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair…\" The driver boarded and started up the old bus which protested with a shuddering rumble as Dick moved to the front. He stood between the seats, waving to get everyone's attention. \"Gentleman, and ladies, this is the beginning of something wonderful. This is the Stillwater Almost Famous tour of 1973, certain to go down in the history books and send us up in the charts. May it be filled with good memories and great music for us all.\" He bowed before them with a flourish, to a smattering of applause. The driver chose that moment to put the bus in drive and it lurched forward with a gasp, throwing Dick off balance. He clawed at the seat before him but couldn't stop himself from tumbling to the floor as the bus pulled away from the curb. Laughter filled the air as he struggled to his feet and pulled himself into the nearest seat, glaring from under the brim of his hat at the smirking driver. Penny couldn't wipe the smile off her face. She turned to share it with William and noticed he was smiling as well, to himself, as he scribbled in his tiny notebook. A few hours later, the bus was chugging valiantly down the highway and everything was peaceful. So far, the tour was off to a great start. Polexia and Jeff were talking quietly. Or maybe they were kissing; Penny couldn't see them from her seat. Russell was asleep with his guitar in his hands. Dick was kicked back, reading a paperback Western. Larry and Ed were passing a joint with the roadies and quietly discussing the scenery flying by outside the windows. William was…well, he was staring at her. She could feel his gaze burning through the back of her skull. She chose to ignore that and flip through an old music magazine she'd found tucked into the seat, tracing the faces of her \"friends\" with her thumb. They stared up at her from their paper prison, flat and glossy. She couldn't help but sigh contentedly at where she'd been and where she was going.[Chapter 18] Yes, it's been too long and no, I have nothing to say for myself! The bus finally rolled to a stop in Tempe, Arizona in front of the King of the Road Motor Lodge. As soon as the doors creaked open, everyone seemed to roll out as one unit to stretch. Dick hurried ahead to gather room keys as the bags were unloaded. Penny stretched her arms over her head and yawned, feeling the mood of those around her shifting. On the bus everyone, with the possible exception of William, had seemed relaxed to the point of laziness. The handful of Polaroids now in her possession of sleeping Stillwater members proved that. Now, everyone looked restless. Agitated. She gathered her belongings and sauntered off through the lobby behind Russell. She expected Sapphire and Estrella to already be in residence with Sabbath and she wasn't disappointed. She spotted them as soon as she walked inside, slumped on the sofa near the front desk like wilted flowers. \"Penny! Thank God you're here!\" Sapphire leapt to her feet and scrounged for her sloppy assortment of luggage, dragging it to meet Penny halfway with Estrella on her heels. She launched into a rant about Ozzy before Penny could even greet her. They'd had a fight, a big one, and she'd been kicked out of the room. Ozzy had told the manager that he didn't want her anywhere near him anymore and now she was adrift in Arizona, heartbroken and in need of some sympathy. And a room. And controlled substances. \"It's okay! You know how these guys are, he'll cool down soon. Just calm down.\" She soothed her friend, feeling a little flustered herself but trying not to let it show. \"Penny, I'm going crazy! If I don't get into a room and take a Valium…\" She drifted off as Penny shushed her. She'd already checked with William to make sure she could stay in his room in case Russell's mood hadn't lifted. He'd seemed thrilled with the idea; surely he wouldn't mind a few more girls. She could already see he was going to be valuable on this tour. Journalists were usually assured rooms whereas her Band-Aids were not. \"It's okay. We can stay with William. He doesn't mind.\" She told them, smiling over her shoulder at him. He didn't look so thrilled anymore. She started to ask him what was wrong but her heart leapt as Russell caught her eye from across the lobby, where he stood talking to Jeff. He picked up his guitar case and motioned for her to follow him as he turned away. \"Okay, I've got to go. Everything's going to be fine. It's all happening!\" She giggled, grabbing her suitcase and dashing off after her guitar god. She glanced over her shoulder as she headed down the hallway to see the girls descending on William. The last thing she saw before turning the corner was Sapphire kissing him on the cheek then wrenching the room key from his hand and marching away. Russell led her down the winding red hallway to Room 104 and fumbled to unlock the door, cursing loudly when it wouldn't budge. She gently took the key from his hand and unlocked the door without a problem. He lurched inside and placed his case on the floor before collapsing face-down on the queen-sized bed with a heavy sigh. \"God, I'm so fucking tired.\" His voice was muffled by the bedspread. Penny flipped the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign around and closed the door behind her, quickly changing into a fresh outfit before climbing onto the bed next to Russell. He groaned and rolled over on top of her, kissing her neck and running his hands through her hair. \"I thought you were tired.\" She whispered, smiling up at the ceiling. \"I'm never too tired for this.\" He mumbled as he nuzzled her neck, scratching her skin with his unshaven jawline. A sharp knock on the door stopped them in their tracks. \"Go away!\" Russell called out, the annoyed lines on his forehead returning. Penny reached up to smooth them away with her fingers and he smiled, but then the knock sounded again. \"Russell, open the damn door! It's Jeff!\" Russell cursed under his breath and reluctantly rolled off the bed to let the singer in. Penny stood up and wandered over to the window, perching on a green velvet chair bathed in sunlight. \"What do you want Bebe?\" Russell looked even more agitated as Jeff made himself comfortable on the edge of the bed. \"We need to talk Russell. About that kid, the journalist.\" Russell heaved a loud sigh, \"I thought we'd already covered this, man. What's the problem?\" \"I'm worried, man. I just don't trust him. He could ruin us and you act like he's no big deal.\" \"Shit, Bebe, what do you want me to do? Kill him?\" Russell rolled his eyes. Jeff just shook his head, \"No, man. You've got to talk to him.\" \"He likes us, he's not going to say anything bad.\" \"You don't know that! Do you really want to risk it? Talk to him, man.\" Jeff insisted, rising to his feet. Russell was silent, wondering why Jeff was so insistent. Jeff jerked his head discreetly in Penny's direction and raised a brow. She pretended not to notice and looked away, staring back through the grimy window to the crystalline blue pool below as Russell turned to look at her for a long moment. She heard him sigh, \"Okay, fine. I'll talk to him tonight.\" That night, after the wildest radio interview in history and an unplanned dip in the hotel swimming pool, Russell returned to his room alone to \"get some sleep\". And an annoyed Penny found herself knocking on William's door at 3 am, dripping water on the carpet and smelling rather strongly of chlorine, with Sapphire at her side. Nude. William had left the party early, ostensibly to do some writing but she knew he had just been too shy to join in the festivities. She had watched him taking furtive notes in a lawn chair for an hour or so before fleeing in horror when Sapphire's clothing had suddenly disappeared. The door creaked open and a sleepy William peered out at them and groaned, trying to shut the door back when he caught sight of Sapphire. It was obviously too much for him to bear at this time of the morning. \"Wait, William! We need a place to sleep!\" Penny protested, pushing the door back open before he could lock it. \"We won't be any trouble!\" Sapphire added, trying and failing to look innocent. He sighed and stepped back to let them in, covering his eyes as Sapphire flounced by. \"Thanks, Opie. I'm going to take a shower.\" She announced grandly, stumbling over William's bag on the way to the bathroom. \"Me too.\" Penny agreed, fondly patting William's head as she passed by. His hands dropped from his face and he looked even more shocked, if that was possible, as the two girls disappeared into the bathroom together. Penny knew that their giggling and splashing would drive him to hide under the covers, his imagination running wild.[Chapter 19] Penny awoke early the next morning to a crash and a whimper. Rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she sat up to see William sprawled out on the floor at the end of the bed. \"William? Are you okay?\" She asked quietly, trying not to awaken Sapphire who was snoring beside her. \"I'm fine.\" He squeaked, scrambling to his feet, \"I just fell over some shoes.\" He glared at the towering wooden platforms that seemed to mock him as they stood strong and steady, like a rock. He tried to kick one over and succeeded only in stubbing his toe. The shoe didn't budge. William threw his hands up and stomped off to the bathroom while Penny giggled and fell back onto the pillow. The phone rang sometime after noon while Penny was sat on the floor with William, helping him go through the notes and bits of paper he'd already amassed. She crawled across the floor to grab it, \"William's room!\" \"Penny?\" Russell's puzzled voice on the other end of the line caught her off guard and she sat up straight. \"Hi, Russell.\" She replied, turning to raise her brows at William. William immediately began motioning and mouthing words, waving his arms to get her attention. She knew he wanted her to ask Russell for another interview but this wasn't the right time. So she turned away, twirling the phone cord around her finger. \"You're staying with the kid?\" Russell laughed and Penny felt her cheeks growing hot. \"Did you want to speak to William?\" She asked stiffly. \"No, never mind that. Hey, come up to my room for a minute, will you?\" He didn't even give her a chance to answer before hanging up. Penny sat down the receiver and sighed, feeling a twinge of annoyance. Mostly at herself for allowing him to treat her this way. No. She shoved that thought aside immediately, deciding to focus instead on the project that lay ahead of her. She was really going to have to work on Russell. He could be changed. Molded and shaped. He had to be, he was so close to being perfect. And he cared about her. She knew that. He told her all the time. A smile flitted across her face as she jumped to her feet, fluffing up her curls and sliding on her shoes while checking her reflection in the mirror. She had completely forgotten about William until he spoke up as she was headed for the door. \"Where are you going?\" He asked, looking pitiful as he juggled his paper scraps. \"To see Russell!\" She called back cheerfully as the door swung shut behind her. As the show started that night, Penny was practically in a state of euphoria. Russell commanded the stage, she knew everyone's eyes were on him. All those girls in the audience were staring up at him like he was a god. And he was all hers. Well, almost. Leslie had called earlier at the most inopportune time, while she and Russell were twisted up in his sheets. She could still feel the weight of him on top of her as he reached over to answer the phone, pressing his finger against her lips. She could still see him staring deep into her eyes when he told Leslie that he loved her before hanging up. The lights came up on stage and the music rang out in the arena. The crowd roared. Russell paced the stage, his fingers flying across the guitar. She smiled, swaying to the music, secure in the knowledge that he could feel her eyes on him. She turned to say something to William but the grating, electric sound of feedback filled the air. She looked towards the stage and saw Russell frozen in place, like his hand was glued to the microphone stand. From the side of the stage she could see his face. Immediately, she knew something wasn't right. For an agonizing moment, her heart and everything around her seemed to stop. Then he dropped like a sack of potatoes and the music ground to a halt. Penny gasped, grabbing the arm of whoever was standing next to her. The roadies rushed to his side. She watched as they dragged him off stage, hurrying through the dark, and then she followed them at a dead run. \"Is he okay?\" She asked desperately, dashing behind them up the steps and into their makeshift trailer. \"I don't know, I think he's in shock.\" One of the roadies said, propping Russell up on a chair. Russell stared straight ahead, his hand lifted in the air like a dog with a wounded paw. \"Russell? Russell, it's Penny. Look at me!\" She knelt in front of him, her hands cupping his face. He looked at her without seeing her, his eyes unfocused. She patted his cheek, trying to keep his attention, but his eyes drifted. \"Get him a beer!\" Dick suggested from the doorway. Everyone seemed to drift in behind him, filling the tiny trailer. Someone handed Penny a beer and she popped the top, offering it to him. He took it, then sat it down on the table beside him. \"Give me your hand, Russell.\" Penny said softly. \"I'm going to find whoever is in charge and kick his ass. Destroy this fucking dump!\" Dick roared, slamming the door behind him. And they did. As Penny wrapped a bandage around Russell's red and blistered palm, the band and crew overturned and broke everything in sight. Even William tipped over a half-empty cup of beer and then looked embarrassed about it. It wasn't long before Dick returned, yelling and banging on the door, \"Hey, hey, come on, come on! Let's get on the bus, let's go!\" Penny grabbed her tackle box purse and helped Russell to his feet as everyone flooded out of the wrecked trailer. They weaved towards the bus as Dick began arguing with a man in tight pants. Russell was still a little unsteady on his feet but Penny managed to push him up the stairs and into a seat. She was worried that he still hadn't said a word but at least his eyes were focused now. But he looked despondent. She sat down next to him and took his hand, tracing the lines on his uninjured palm with her fingers as the rest of the band filed in. \"Russell, it'll be okay. I think this is a good sign for you. A very good sign. This is going to be a positive thing.\" Penny told him earnestly, smiling when he looked over at her, \"It's happened to all the greats.\" \"Yeah?\" He asked hoarsely and she nodded. As the bus crashed through the locked gate and rolled off into the night, Russell laid his head on her shoulder and fell asleep. And all was right with the world.
