Written by Velvet Dark 007 ------- It was a beautiful, yet disturbingly hot day at the Chicken Sanctuary, so, like us people these days in Florida, they went swimming... all except one.. \"AYE! I SAID I DON'T WANTA GO IN TH' WATER!\" Mac protested to Ginger, who was merrily hanging out with Rocky and the other chickens in the lake. Ginger frowned. \"Awww Mac, it's not that bad...\" \"Yeah Four-eyes! It's great!\" Rocky interrupted. Ginger dunked him under water for saying that. Mac didn't budge. \"I said Gingah, I ain't going in.\" Mac stood her ground, but Ginger knew a tact to get her in and cool off from the blistering temperatures. Ginger got out of the water and darted for...... \"HEY!!!!!!!\" Ginger shriked behind Fowler, who was trying to cool off himself, but didn't want to go swimming either. \"What is you young whippersnapper?\" He snapped. Ginger groaned and dragged him outside, much to his dismay. \"HEY HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! UNHAND ME NOW!\" \"No way. Mac won't go swimming, and I think you're the one to convince her.\" \"ME?!\" \"Of course. Now come on... GET... IN... THE.... WATER!!!\" The wily hen shoved the old rooster in the lake, shutting him up and drenching him in the process. Fowler was not pleased at this... \"Perposterous!\" He whined. Ginger dove in and kicked him over to the reluctant Mac, who was now taking notes on such. Ginger shouted out to her... \"LOOK WHO'S HERE!!!\" She yelled out, holding the old rooster by this feathers. He struggled to get free and back to what he was doing. Mac ran over and looked at him. \"Aye... never thought you'd be swimmin' any day soon.\" She said with a small smile on her face. Fowler blushed but kept his stern compouser. Ginger kicked him in the shin again. \"Say it...\" She said, gritting her teeth. Fowler didn't say it at first, but managed to get it out- \"Why-dont-you... come for a nice-brisky... swim?\" Mac thought for a moment like a Chao in Sonic Adventure, and then resulting in... \"Well, aye... I'm not sure...\" Ginger jolted. Her plan to get her right-hand hen to swim failed. She grumbled and swam over to the edge and looked her in the glasses. Mac gulped and then int he blink of the eye, Ginger grabbed Mac by the arms, sending her to fall, feet first into the lake. Mac went under and came back out screaming. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIEEEE!!!!!!\" \"What did you do to her nanny?\" Fowler snapped, floating over to Mac's side, calimg her down. Ginger stifled laughter, but trying to act like she was sorry. \"(giggle)I'm... (snort) sorry... (giggled) Mac... for... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!\" Ginger bursted into laughter and then going under herself. Rocky went over and looked at his girl-friend-hen. He giggled himself. \"You okay there doll-face?\" Ginger came up and upper-cutted him with a wet fist. He rubbed his chin in pain. \"What was that for?\" He groaned. Ginger looked mad. \"One, laughing at me for almost drowning and two, calling me doll face.\" She swam off, but not before noticing that Mac and Fowler were holding hands, swimming off together. \"Aye... thanks for th' swimmin' lessons.\" \"Least I could do.\" Ginger smiled at the cute sight. She relaxed and thought to herself- \"All is good.\" And then she heard Rocky float by and said to her- \"You even know what they're doin over there dollfa....

Nothing to good, im just really bored Disclaimer: yes, i own chicken run and all it's characters. HA.not The day was coming to a peaceful end. Most chickens were retiring to their huts for the night as they saw the evening sky overcoming the sky like a dark blanket. But not all the chickens dissappeared from the island when the stars replaced the sun. The silhouet of a chicken was visible in the moonlight, sitting in the high branches of a tall willow near the edge of the lake. In the moonlight, it was easy to make out the slim figure of Ginger sitting high amost the branches and leafs. She had gotten in the habit of star gazing back the farm. Almost every night she would sit on top of her hut and watch the stars for hours. She couldn't explain why, but she had always had a fondness for them. Just the way they shimmered against the darkness of the night sky, it was really rather stunning. The time was also used to think of more and new ways to escape. How many nights she had battled with herself, forcin herself to think harder. Part of her always just wanted to give up, to just sit back ad take it. But of course, Ginger being who she is, never listened. She always kept going. Not just for the others, but mostly for herself. She had to know that yes, she could be strong and keep going.. But now this time was used to just be. Not have to worry about and escape plan or the dayliy egg count, just sit and enjoy everything around her. This wonderful freedom that they now had. The freedom she craved for so long. At first she wasn't exactly sure how to tak it really. A place like this only exsisted in her dreams, somehow she wondered if she would soon wake up and would once again find herself in the darkness and dispear of the farm. She realised though that when she awoke one day to once again she this place, Ginger knew then for sure it was real.At last... Her thought drifting from one thing to the next, she continued her gaze at the stars. There was another reason she loved the stars so much. They reminded her of a night not too long ago... She was sitting on the roof of her hut late one night. But not alone this time. She happened to come across Rocky being there as well. Ginger thought it right to thank him for saving her earlier that night... \"I just wanted to say, thank you, for saving my life. For saving our lives.\" She said,a little embarresed. He only nodded. Ginger was unsre of what to say next, but she wanted to keep this going. She had found that she actually liked being with Rocky. She wasn't sure how to explain it. So she spoke of whatever was in her heart. For some reason, she felt more...free with him \" you know, i come up here every night and just imagine what it must be like on the other side.\" Now she could feel his eyes on her. \"It's funn, I..I'v never actuall felt grass beneath my feet.\" And for a brief moment, she let her sadness show. But she quickly snapped herself back. \"Im sorry, here I am rambling on about hills and grass and you somthing to say.\" Ginger wasn't sure how, but whenever she was around Rocky, her let down the wall. She was actually starting to let him know how she really felt. She had no idea how he was doing it, but she had never done that with anyone else.. Soon he was rabling on about grass. trying to make a point. Ginger didn't understand anything he was trying to get across, but it didn't really matter. Rocky then knew that he had failed to get the point across. \"...Your welcome\" He said in a defeated tone as he put his head in his hand. She sensed this and kindly said, \" You know, that hill is looking closer tonight then it ever has before.\" And that was the truth. She leaned back, still watching the hills in the distance, and put her hand down. But instead of feeling the cold metal of the roof, she felt the warmth of Rocky's hand. Both chickens jumped away. Yet somthing deep inside Ginger told her not to. She ignored it and thought it was best to leave. \"Well, good night Rocky.\" Ginger began to make her way down from the roof \"Good night...Ginger.\" Rocky said, with a slight bit of fondess...he didn't want to give it away. Ginger stopped. Had he actually called her 'Ginger'? And the way he said it. Ginger loved it...the way his voice sounded when he spoke her name. She couldn't help but sigh happily and smile as she walked away... Ginger sat with her eyes closed as she remembered back to that night. She didn't know what she feeling, but now she knew. While she was day dreaming, she wasn't aware that someone had climbed up the tree and was now sitting beside her. Rocky''s rich brown eyes stayed fixed on Ginger's beautiful face. He knew why she loved the night. The stars and the overall calmness that seemed to come with it. But Rocky loved the night because this was the time where he had Ginger all to himself. No thoughts of talk of the previous day or of tomorrow, all that mattered was the two lovers, earning for one another. No worries of anything, just them under the starry sky. Ginger finally felt the other presence beside her and opoened her eyes and turned her head to the side. She was startled to see Rocky there and let out a small gasp as she lost her balance and started to fall backwards toward the ground... But Ginger didn't go very far as Rocky quickly grabbed her shoulders to prevent her from falling. She leant her head against Rocky's chest, letting her racing heart rate return to normal. Rocky spoke as he stroked the back of Ginger's head. \"You alright there hun?\" He whispeared into her ear. \"Oh, you startled me!\" Rocky chuckled. \" I can see that\" Ginger hit him playfully on the arm, laughing softly. \"What are you doing up here anyway?\" She questioned him. \"I was wondering where you were, I havn't seen ya all day.\" Rocky said as he slid his arm around her waist, pulling her closer. Ginger didn't resist. She'd missed him too. So she buried her head in Rocky's chest, and following him, slid her arms around his shoulders pulling him closer to her. Rocky had no objections to that. They sat in each other's hold in silence. Just enjoying the comforting warmth of each other. No words needed to be spoken. This right here was prefect. Rocky loved this more than anything. At the begining, he had been unsure of how to show he truely love Ginger, so he could only express it with words. But at the point no words needed to be spoken for Ginger to know his love for her, And the same for Rocky. Both chickens could feel the strenght of their love in this embrace. Rocky then let out a yawn. He hadn't meant to, but it was the late hours of the night, and truthfully, he was tired. But he had no intention of leaving Ginger's hold. Ginger smiled warmly as she heard the sound of Rocky's yawn. She herself was tired, she discovered that she was starting to fall asleep in Rocky's arms. She took her arms from around Rocky's neck and looked at him. \"I think it's time we head off.\" She said with deep affection in her voice. Rocky gave a dissipointed look. But before he could go anything else, Ginger lent forward and softly kissed him. Afterwords she spoke, \"No reason we can't continue this inside.\" From the look in his eyes, Ginger knew Rocky like that idea. So both chickens made their way down the tree and headed to their home, still keeping close. Rocky's arm was still around her waist and he was holding her hand with his other hand. And as they headed off for a peaceful sleep together, the Ginger cast one more look at the night sky, but she had found somthing even more wonderful to look at as she gazed into Rocky's eyes. wow...that was longer then i intended. sorry if this was kind of sappy, but it's 3 a.m. and i was bored also sorry for the many spelling mistakes im sure i made and if you havn't already, read my other new story 'Jupiter'","LastChapter":"here's a little one chapterGinger/Rocky fic.

He staggered around, trying to keep the wood from falling. Mac jumped up and came to his rescue, holding up an end. \"Bout time!\" \"Yes sir.\" Mac Giggled. Lately she had been helping him out with many things, as much as Frowler hated to say it, he was getting old. The other hens were far to busy to help him with anything, taking care of the chicks. Mac would have been too, she loved the wee ones, but after.. the incident involving the catapult... Bunty had put her on the side lines. Ginger didn't know and Mac didn't intend to tell her.. It hurt not to be trusted, it hurt more to lose Ginger's trust then anyone elses. They weren't best friends without a good reason. \"Mac! Mac!\" Frowler shouted. Mac had subconscious drop her side of the board in her deep thoughts. Yet before Mac could respond by taking the board again a pair of wings already help them up. \"Easy old man! Don't want to blow a gasket.\" Rocky chuckled, helping the elder with the plank. Mac quickly too the board in her wings as well. \"Im so sorrie Frowler!! I-\" \"Hey, Red! Come here and give us a hand.\" Rocky shouted, a young ginger red rooster ran up to them. Around his neck was a reddish black bandana. \"Ok Dad.\" Red said and took the plank in his wings as well. \"I wouldn't need all this help if 'some-one stopped staring off into space!\" Frowler snarled at Mac, she sighed sadly. \"I said I was sorry!\" Mac frowned. \"High aunty Mac!\" Red shouted, taking first notice of her. The little rooster often spent time with her out of a curious nature. The two were often going on long walk with his sister and mother, looking at the plant life and such. \"Enough chit chat!\" Frowler ordered. \"To the new coop.\" \"Yes sir..\" The other groaned. Mac wheezed the entire way to the new coop. All the coops were now named instead of numbered. With the expanding number of chickens they were forced to build new coops to accommodate. So far, the new unnamed coop was almost down, just a few touches were need to finish it. They managed to get inside the structure and dropped the board into place on the floor. \"Perfect fit, and the last floor board needed. I'll collect the sticks needed for the steps, you all will nail this in.\" Frowler ordered. The elder rooster then strutted from the coop. \"Hm, lucky old coot. What make him think he's incharge?\" Rocky asked as he drug a bag on nails over and began to pound them into the floor. \"He's an old lad. But he nee be admit it.\" Mac spoke sadly. \"All that benden and hammeren be hard on his old bones..\" \" I swear, after all this time I still cannot under stand you..\" Rocky mumbled. \"She said that Frowler can't hammer so her gave the job to you, so he wouldn't hurt his pride he made it sound like an order.\" Red explained, handing his father another nail. \"Thanks..\" Rocky muttered. He looked out the door after Frowler. \"I still say he shouldn't be giving out orders.\" \"Aye, the old lad be a bossy badger, but he still be apart a this family.\" Mac smiled, looking down at Rocky. \"I'll wanten to be off, he may need a wee bit a help out thare.\" She spoke before heading out the door. \"Where she going?\" Rocky asked in an annoyed fashion. Red did a face palm. \"Dad, you never, ever try to understand her!\" Red frowned. \"In order for that to happen, I need to stop translating.\" \"Alright, Alright! I'll try to understand what she says. Geeze, understanding my old buddy Mac, in America, wasn't this hard.\" Rocky stated. \"Was she pretty?\" Red asked out of curiosity. He was surprised by his fathers sudden laughter. \"He, Red. Mac was a he.\"Rocky chuckled. \"It couldn't have been. Mac is a girls name.\" Red argued. \"No, its a boy's name.\" Rocky said. Red puffed out his plumage in confusion. \"Then why is auntie Mac named Mac?\" Red questioned, crossing his arms. \"Its obviously... I mean she must be... maybe..\" Rocky cocked his head to one side. \"You know... I never thought of that.\" Rocky scratch his chin and a smile spread over his beak. \"I need to see your mother for a second Red, finish nailing this for me.\" Then Rocky was out the door, leaving Red with a bag of nails, a hammer, and a few puzzling thoughts. \"Thats it Libby! You just knitted your first scarf !\" Babs cheered. Beside her was a tiny hen, just growing out of chic hood, some yellow feathers still clung to her coat. Her other feathers were a brown color with the rare red father sticking out. \"Yippe! Oh Mum look at my Scarf!\" Libby shouted, running over to her mother in excitement. \"Very good Libby. Do you need some help getting it on?\" Ginger asked her daughter. The young hen nodded eagerly. With a soft smile, Ginger took the sloppily knit, pink scarf and put around Libby's neck. \"How dose it look?\" Libby asked. Ginger chuckled. \"Like a princess.\" \"Ya!! Did you hear that aunt Babs!\" Libby shouted, running back to babs in pure joy. Ginger rolled her eyes softly and was about to get back to grain harvesting.. when her mate used this time to burst in on her. \"Ginger!\" Rocky shouted as he made his way towards her at break neck speed. Ginger sighed, at least she knew where Libby got it from.. \"Hey Ginger,i have a question for you.\" \"So ask it.\" Ginger shrugged, beginning to pick more grain stocks. \"Why is Mac,called Mac?\" Rocky asked. Ginger looked up at him in confusion. \"Its her name silly..\" Ginger frowned. \"No-no! I mean, why dose everyone call her Mac, I mean it's a boy's name. \" Rocky said, trying again. \"Is it short for something?\" Ginger stiffened, she looked away. \"It is a short form.\" \"For what? \" Rocky asked. Ginger stepped away from him. \"I, I don't know..\" She muttered. Rocky frowned, Ginger wouldn't give him any eye contact, and her feathers were ruffling. The sure signs of and amateur liar. \"Do you think the others might know?\" Rocky asked slyly. Ginger slammed her grain basket down to the ground and rounded on him. \"Drop it, Rocky!\" She ordered. \"This is a difficult subject.\" \"Aww, come on-\" \"Daddy! Look at my Scarf!\" \"Thats nice sweety-pea.\" Rocky said, not even looking. \"What makes it a difficult-\" \"You didn't even look!\" With a sigh, Rocky turned to looked at Libby. It wasn't that he didn't love his daughter. It was just that he was slightly busy. \"Wow Sweety-Pea, its even pretty then I imagined.\" Rocky shouted before turning back to Ginger, only to find that she was already gone. \"Great. Now who can I ask?\" \"Hey Babs! Have you seen Mac around here?\" \"Bunty!!\" Rocky smiled whipping around to chase after her. \" Macy!\" \"No..\" \"Mackenzie?\" \"No.\" \"MacKena!\" \"No! No! No!\" Bunty said, glaring at him. \"Look, even if you guess right I won't tell you.\" \"Awww. Why!?!\" \"I swear, your like a chic yourself... cause its difficult.\" Bunty frowned. She snarled when Rocky opened his mouth again. \"Guess one more time and I'll rip each and everyone your tail feathers out!\" Rocky jumped back always. \"Sheesh, are you cold or what?\" Before Bunty could begin to counter that, Libby came running up. \"Aunt Bunty! Look at my scarf! I made it myself!\" \"Its very nice dear.\" Bunty said, forgetting Rocky completely. \"Do you want to go for cookies?\" \"Ya! Ya! Ya!\" Libby cheered and let Bunty lead her away. \"Hey! I was..\"Rocky began but they were already gone. \"Asking you a question...\" He finished sleepily. The rooster began to think. There had to be someone who'd give him an answer! It had to be someone forgetful.. slightly dim... \"Rocky! Could you give me a hand with my wool!!\" Rocky smiled. \"Perfect.\" \"So I said to her, I says ' You can't be right'! Oh but you know Maybel, always has to have the last word! So I tried to tell her otherwise but she'd have none of it, ya see.\" Rocky slumped down in his seat as Babs yammered on about things he didn't really need to know. His wings were held out with wool loosely rapped around for Bab's to knit with. The hen didn't seem to notice that Rocky was glaring at her as she knitted a blanket for some one named Patty. Rocky rolled his eyes for the hundredth time . \"Uh, Babs..\" \"Yes Rocky, what is it? Am I running low on wool?\" Babs asked. \"Or is it something else?\" \"Something else.\" Rocky said, thinking something up quickly. \" See I made Mac a cake for... um... all her help...\" \"With the new coop? How nice.\" Babs nodded. \"Uh, ya, ok. Lets go with that.\" Rocky chuckled. \"But the lettering is a little uneven. I mean the top says 'Thanks for all your help' but the bottom only say Mac! I mean its like making an uneven number of.... stitches and pearls!\" \"My thats not good.. what are you going to do?\" Babs asked. \"Well, I wanted to put her full name at the bottom..\" Rocky smiled. \"But I have no clue what it is... I was wondering if you could tell me what it -\" \"Oh no!\" Babs gasped, dropping her knitting. \"I can't! \" \"Ah come on Babs!\" Rocky whined. \"I just want to know her full name... for the pie!\" \"You said it was a cake.\" Babs frowned. \"Ah.. its a pie cake?\" Rocky smiled cheesly. Luckily for him Babs bought it. \"Pie Cake? Never had on of those...\" Babs spoke, licking her beak. \"Uh, my own special recipe.. thats why I want the first one to look as perfect as it tastes!!\" Rocky explained. \"I mean, how much would the others want one if it looked uneven?\" \"Most likly about as much a sloppily knit hat..\" Babs frowned. She sat quietly for a moment \"Macklyn.\" \"What?\" Rocky asked. \"Her name. Its Macklyn.\" Babs said, picking up her knitting. \"But whatever you do, don't call her by her full name or-\" Babs looked over to find that Rocky was already gone. \"Else..\" Mac was helping Frowler carry some sticks to the new coop. They were just making there way through the Quietest part of the chicken's busy town. \"Back in the RAF, everyone would have help make new bunkers! Why I recall when we were setting up a new one just outside of St Malo France! \" Frowler said as he walked by some chicks playing a game of tiddly winks. \" We all lent a helping hand with construction and setting up the beds!\" Mac tried to listen the best she could, but Frowler's loud and often bland voice began to slurr the words together. She smiled at the Chicks as she walked by herself. They paid her no attention, to enveloped in their game. She looked back out infront of her, only to bang into Frowler. \"Bah!\" He clucked as he fell over. Mac toppling over him. Her glasses flew off and clattered off some place. The chicks began to cheep in laughter at the sight of them. Mac didn't see what as so funny. Especially with her glasses off. \"Corn swallop! Get off me you blind turkey!\" Frowler snarled. Mac leaped up only to have her foot catch on a roller blade behind her. She flipped backward and hit the ground with a loud thump. Frowler took no notice of her tumble as he got up himself. Luckily the chicken around them came to their aide. \"Are you alright Mac?\" \"Fine Ginger.\" Mac muttered as she was helped up. All she could see of Ginger was a red blob, but she knew her friend's voice anywhere.. \"Heres your glasses!\" Bunty's voice came this time and her specks were once again looped around her head, the hanging glass frames swung down infront of her eyes. She once again could make out the world. \"Aye, thank you kindly!\" Mac smiled, she began to bend down. Picking up her sticks, Ginger ran over to a few sticks that had gone a few feet during the fall. Rocky came up from behind them, he was smiling slyly. Now he could prove how useful his skills of getting information were to Ginger, who personally though he didn't have any at all. He made out Mac in the distance, with Ginger and Bunty off to the side. Why not get two birds with one stone!? He could prove his intellect to both Ginger and Bunty at the same time. He made his way up behind Mac, just a few paces from where she was bending over. Picking the first stick. \"Hey! Your doing a good job there!\" Rocky smiled \"Macklyn!\" Silence dawned on the chickens. Mac froze right where she was. Ginger, Bunty and even Frowler was gapping at him in shock. \"What?\" Mac asked suddenly. \"What did you say?\" \"I said ' Your doing a good job.' \" Rocky repeated. \"Oh, for a moment I thought you'd be callen me-\" \"Macklyn.\" Rocky finished. SMACK!! Rocky yelped, holding his head in pain. Mac was on him in a second. She used the stick she had been picking up to smack him upside the head repeatedly, knowing what little upper body strength she had. Her blows with the stick were piracies, but they lacked any power behind them. Suddenly Mac was tackled out of the way. She was rolled onto to stomach a few feet away, Ginger was up before Mac and ripped the stick out of her hand. \"Mac! Calm down!\" Ginger ordered. Mac looked up at her, and back to everyone else. All eyes were on her.. including the chicks. Who were now huddled behind Frowler in fear. Mac sat up quietly and everyone around her tensed. Mac could feel the memories welling up in the back of her mind. Why didn't she just stay in her nest today! Emotions all came at once and before anyone could stop her Mac ran off into the woods. Rocky slowly sat up, everyone was staring off to where Mac had disappeared. \"What was her problem?\" Mac asked. SMACK! \"Oww!\" Rocky whined after the stick Ginger had flung hit him square in the head. \"I told you to drop it!!\" Ginger spat at him as she got closer. \"But no, oh no! You just couldn't , could you!!!\" \"Geeze doll face! Why are you so-\" \"Its Ginger!! We've been together a year and you can't get that threw your head!\" Ginger growled, she whisked around to Bunty. \"Bunty, keep him with you till I get back! I need to Find Mac.\" \"Macklyn.\" Rocky said, which earned him another wap, this time form Frowler. \"In all my years I have NEVER seen such a disrespect for another birds feeling!\" Frowler stated, Rocky flinched back slightly. \" Its clear that it hurt Mac's feeling! Yet you just keep going on about!\" \"Wow, Gramps.. Never took you as a feeling sort of guy..\" Rocky spoke. \"Hmm.\" Was the only answer he got. \"Right, I'll be right back.\" Ginger said and ran off after Mac. Mac sat on a log, over looking the lake, separating them from the rest of the world. She kicked a nearby rock over the edge and into the water.. It didn't make her feel better about what had just happened though.. \"Wheh am I such a bugger?\" Mac sighed. She didn't mean to have that happen.. it just that her full name.. Macklyn.. Only her sister could call her that... All the chickens on Tweety's farm crowed around a new pair of chickens. One was slightly older then the other. Her feathers were white with small black splotches and she dawned a blue, tartan patterned scarf. The other was smaller, pure white and had a yellow, tartan scarf. Her cock's comb was sticking out all over the place, but was held out of her eyes by a pair of glasses. She was huddled behind the larger one in shyness. \"Hello Lassies!\" The large one smiled giving them a wave.. One brave ginger red chicken waved back. \"Um, hello.\" She smiled. \"I be called Mary and this is my younger sister Macklyn!\" Mary said, marching up to the ginger hen, her sister keeping close behind her all the way. All the other chickens took steps back, all but the ginger red one. \"And what would yee be called.?\" \"Ginger.\" Ginger smiled. \"Pleasure thare Ginger!\" Mary spoke, snatching Ginger's wing and shaking it enthusiastically. Ginger seemed surprised, but let her continue. \"Like wise.\" Ginger said, finally shaking back. \"What brings you two to Tweety's farm? Can't be her kindness.\" \"Not a boonie farmer? Aye, thats too bad.\" Mary sighed. \"Thee reason were here is that, our owner be grinen us down from Scotland and traden us with the farmer's here for other chickens. Get new blood in the coops, I spose.\" \"Really? Well I guess that explains why Suzen and Tallie were taken away. Was your old farm.. nice?\" Ginger asked. \"Grass and such?\" \"Aye, a bonnie, bonnie farm she was. Still is.\" Mary nodded. \"So ah.. how musch longer till we be heading off to your farm?\" Mary asked, Looking around at the chain fence and dogs staring at them through it. At this Ginger's smile grew sad. \"Im afraid this is it..\" Ginger sighed. The younger one looked around in fight, her older sister more in disgust. \"You be pullen my tail feathers! You mean you live here?!\" Mary frowned. \"What a load of hornswaddle!\" \"I know.. here, I'll show you around.\" Ginger smiled. It had been a week since the Scottish sisters had arrived. All the chickens now were un-afraid to go near them. Yet Mary was still flustered with having to live in such a muck hole. Ginger, now trusting her more then before, shared her plans of escape with Mary in a meeting with her friends. \"Thats how we do it! We'll make a hole in the fence!\" Ginger finished. The others looked at her in disbelief. \"How are we going to do that?!\" Bunty scowled. \"Bite through it?\" \"I haven't gotten to that yet..\" Ginger frowned. \"This is whats always keeping us from using your plans. Theres no proof that it will work, theres a hole in it or it just seems so.. undo able.\" Babs said. Mary scratched her chin. \"I think I be knowen some chicken with the know how.\" Mary smiled. \"Thats nice but we can't go all the way to Scotland to get them.\"Bunty scowled. \"We don't need to.\" Mary said \" I'll be right back\" Mary stood up and made her way to the door. Ginger jumped up and went after her, catching her when she had one foot out the door. \"Who is it?\" Ginger asked, slightly worried. She had only known Mary for a week and was beginning to worry about letting Mary come to the meeting. \"Trust me.\"Mary winked and was out the door. Ginger sighed and went back up to the table with her plan on it. They waited a few more minutes before the door opened again. They all stiffened, waiting for the farmer's head to appear through the roof, but instead Mary entered, Macklyn at her side. She shyly hide behind her sister again. \"Your little sister.\" Bunty frowned. \"She may be wee, but she be Ginger's age.\"Mary responded.\"Sides, she a smarter any other chicken out thare.\" Mary took Macklyn's wing and lead her up to the table.\"Nee be shy Macklyn! Ging and Babbies won't bite. But with Bunt I nee be sure..\" Mary laughed at the last part, while Bunty gave her a sour glare. \"We need to figure out how to cut through the wire fence.\" Ginger explained, looking at Macklyn. \"We can't use our teeth, but we were hoping you could give use some help.\" Macklyn looked over the poorly drawn plan, Bunty rolled her eyes. \"See, she doesn't know either.\" \"Wire cutters or bolt cutter could work.\" Macklyn said suddenly. \"Ive seen Mr Tweety come in with them on his tool belt everyday this week.\" \"Brillient!\" Mary smiled. \"What do you think Ging?\" \"That would work.\" Ginger spoke. \"But how do we get the cutters!\" Bunty asked. \"Not like he'll give em to us!\" \"We'll use a stick with gum on it.\" Ginger spoke. \"It will pull the cutters out, no problom.\" \"We'll need a stick about a foot long with a die-am-terr of two centimeters.\" Macklyn spoke. \"Or a rra-day-us of one centimeter. The gums goen to have to be at lest under five minutes from the mouth ta be sticky enough to get a good hold.\" Everyone was silent.. Till Ginger spoke again. \"Um,right...lets go get a stick just like Macklyn described... any questions?\" \"Whats a die-am-terr and a rra-day-us ?\" Babs asked. (Diameter, radius) All the chickens watched as Mr Tweety entered the pen a week later. At last Mr Tweety came in chewing some gum, his tool belt hanging from his pants. \"Ginger. Are you ready?\" Mary asked as the braced themselves to begin. \"Ready as I'll ever be.\" Ginger spoke. \"You?\" \"Yep, lets go!\" Mary smiled, leading Ginger out, right behind Mr Tweety, jumping at his legs. \"WHA! What the!\" Mr Tweety gasped, spitting out his gum. Ginger and Mary stopped imidiutly and scurried away, making sure Mr Tweety never new it was them. \"Huh, bloodie chikens..\" Mr Tweety muttered and went back to work. \"We got the gum!\" Bunty said as she and Babs came up to Mary and Ginger. \"Now where is the stick?\" \"Macklyn!\"Mary called, the smaller white chicken came out of coop 17 carrying a foot long stick. \"Boonie lass!\" Mary praised taking the stick, and taking the gum from Babs , putting the gum on the end of the stick. \"Lets get those cutters..\" Ginger smiled. Together the group snuck up on Mr Tweety from behind, they raised the stick up and stuck the gum to the wire cutters, pulling it flawlessly out of it space. \"We did it!\" Babs whispered. The others made a silent cheer, dropped the stick and took the wire cutters into coop 17. Silently that night, the chickens raced over to the fence, waiting until after Mr Tweety had gone back inside to try the plan. \"By my caculations, well be needing two chickens to cuts the wires at once.\" Macklyn explained. The others nodded, and set the wire cutters into the fence. Mary and Bunty each took a handle, pushing them together. Snapping the wire. \"Its working!\" Ginger smiled. \"Well be free this time tomorrow!\" They had managed to make half a hole in the fence, Mary and Bunty almost had the last wire cut.... BARK! BARK! BARK! \"Abort mission! Abort mission!\" Ginger ordered as she and the others race to their coops, dropping the wire cutters on the Tweety race out of the house. \"What is it boys?\" Mr Tweety breathed as he quickly got outside. \"Was it foxes?\" The dog only pointed to a small hole in the fence. \"What the?\"Mr Tweety muttered, entering the pen he could make out his bolt cutters on the ground. He picked them up and rolled them over in his hands. \"I though I looked all over for these..\" With a shrug, Mr Tweety left the pen and set a large piece of wood infront of the hole, before going back inside. \"Darn it.\" Ginger cursed, looking out the window.. she turned back to everyone else in her coop. \"Time for plan B.\" \"Its be silly plan!\" Macklyn said as the Chickens were starting to begin operation Open Gate. The plan was simple, put a brick in the gate to keep it from closing, then have everyone escape at once.. it was easy and simple, but it looked like only Macklyn knew the down side of this plan. \"It nee be silly.\" Mary frowned \"It be brilliant.\" \"You mean dangerous!\" \"Just a wee bit.\" Mary shrugged. \"Oh look, Ginger is goen fer it!\" All the chickens watched as Ginger threw a brick between the gate door and it's latch, the gate banged to a stop, but Mr Tweety took no notice. \"There, now what do you say!\" Mary asked \"Plan work like a charm.\" \"You mean a curse!\" Macklyn said. \"Mary if the door be open, we can be getten out! But other thians can be getten in!\" As if on cue the two dogs burst into the pen, with neither Tweety to keep them in check they began to attack. \"Run!\" Bunty shouted. All the chickens took off for their coops. Macklyn watched as one raced straight for her, her feet almost glued to the ground in fear. Then Mary pushed her out of the way. Macklyn watch in horror as the dog snapped his teeth around her wing. \"Ginger! Get my sister outta here!!\" Mary shouted as she punched the dog in the nose. The dog snarled and shook his head, dislocating Mary's wing with it. \"ACK!!!\" \"Mary!\" Macklyn shouted tearfully, she jumped up and was about to help when Ginger grabbed her wing and began to drag her away. \"Noo!!\" Ginger shut her eyes and pulled the chicken her age up to the wall of a coop. With a quick bang on the wall, it was pulled down and the two were whisked inside. They both hit the ground inside the coop, just as Mary's screams got worse. Macklyn was on her feet again. \"Mary!\" She cried,running for the exit of the coop. \"Stop! Macklyn!\" Ginger Shouted. Two large hens body slammed Macklyn to the floor, the blow sending her glasses smacking into her face. She struggled around, in agony. Her sister was being torn to shreds outside and there was nothing she could do about it. \"I say! What is all the commotion out there!\" Frowler asked, having been drugging into the closet coop by some hens. \"Sounds like the dogs are attacking a cat or something!\" \"Its.. they're attacking Mary..\" Ginger said, hanging her head in guilt. It had been her plan that had gotten Mary attacked. \"Oh dear..\" Frowler muttered. The screams died out, as human voices came, along with a dog whimpering. Then the roof opened up, to show Mr Tweety's face. He reached inside and pulled Macklyn out from under the two hens. She sent a withering look to Ginger before she was completely outside.. Mr Tweety raced back to Mrs Tweety, Macklyn in hand. \"See Mrs Tweety! We still have one Dorking from Scottland left!\"Mr Tweety smiled sheepishly as Mrs Tweety took Macklyn from his hands. \"Its a good thing we ordered two!\" \"We paid money for this scrawny thing?\" Mrs Tweety asked. Mr Tweety gulped. \"Ah, not as much as the other one..\" \"But we did still pay.\" Mrs Tweety growled, she threw Macklyn to the ground. \" I am sick an tired of you spending our money.\" \"But-\" \"The cost of these birds are coming out of your coffee funds Mr Tweety!\" Mrs Tweety frowned and stormed out of the pen. Mr Tweety scowled and looked down at the two dogs. \"You two start this mess. If you hadn't come in the pen then she wouldn't have found out about this little money mix up! What comes out of my coffee funds, comes out of your treat fund!\" The dogs both whined sadly. Mr Tweety picked up a black garbage bag beside him, that had blood dripping from the corners, and lead the two hounds from the cage. Macklyn got up on her knees and watch Mr Tweety sadly as he left. After he was gone she leap up and looked around for her sister. \"Mary?\" She whisper shouted. \"Mary?\" Macklyn craned her neck around , she could make out the place where the dog had attacked her, there was blood all over the ground. Macklyn took a step away from the stop, but stopped when she saw something blowing around on the ground. She ran up and picked it up, ignoring the blood overed ground that her feet were soaking in. Mary's scarf.... or what was left of it... She never went anywhere without it... Mary was... gone.... Macklyn fell down on her knees and began to weep into the bloody scarf. Some chicken peeked out of their coops, but spotting her went back in. Macklyn was both happy and upset that they did this... happy no one would see her cry, but upset that no one would comfort her... till a hand was lain on her shoulder. Macklyn looked up to see Ginger looked down at her sadly.. \"Do you want to go for a walk?\" She asked. Macklyn paused for a moment, before nodding her head. She let Ginger lead her away from the bloody mess, towards a log on the far side of the compound, they both crawled inside, giving them some privacy. \"She's gone...\" Macklyn whispered... Ginger looked at the scarf in her hands before looking at her feet. \"Its all my fault Macklyn...It was my plan..\" Ginger sighed. \"No.\" \"What?\" Ginger asked, looking up at Macklyn. \"No, it not be your fault. I should a warned her better. I should a run instead standen around, waiten for him ta get meh.\" Macklyn sighed. \"But Macklyn..\" \"No.\" Macklyn said harsher this time. \"I'll nee be called Macklyn any longer..\" \"Why is that?\" Ginger asked sadly. \"Mary.. she gave everyboda a nick name... all but me... she said it was cuse our mum let er name meh. Only she can call meh Macklyn.... from now on..\" Macklyn spoke, she stared down at the scarf in sadness.. \"Well, I suppose its only right to give you a nickname then.\" Ginger said. \"How about.... chick or Poullet?\" \"No, they sound stupid..\" Macklyn said. \"How about a spin off of your name... like Mac?\" Ginger asked. \"I like that one..\"Mac admitted, she rubbed the scarf around in her hands... Ginger watch Mac a moment longer before sighing. \"Mac, Im so sorry.. Maybe we should just put all this escaping business behind us..\" \"We'll have nee of that!\" Mac frowned, catching Ginger off guard. \"Mary wanted to get outta here just a much as everyone else. She died to have that happen. We'll nee let it be for nuthen, this time we must be more carefel.\" Ginger smiled. \"I heard that.\" Mac looked back down at Ginger. \"Whats the plan?\" Ginger frowned again.\"Well, Im no good at making good plans..\" \"Yes ya are.\" Mac stated. \"You just need ta go over everything ta find probloms. Im your chicken for that job! Sides.\" Mac reached out her hand for Ginger to take. \"Im not very good at maken plans meself...\" Mac gave a sad smile. \" Whats the plan?\" She repeated. Ginger looked back at Mac, looking threw her glasses into her amber brown eyes, before taking her out streched hand. Mac sniffled, as a more tears joined the river bending down her cheeks. She reached under her yellow scarf, pulling a dried blood covered blue one out from under it. She rubbed it in her hands, looking it over for a moment, before breaking down in a blubbering mess. She barriedher head in the crusty cotton of her sister's scarf. Inhaling the smell of old blood and her sister's feathers. Mac's shoulder shook slightly as she sobbed. Then a hand was lain on her them... Mac looked up.. It was Ginger.. again. \"Oh, Ginger.\" Mac whimpered. \"Im so sorry about attacken hem and hit hem and.. all the other stuff I buggered up!!\" \"Oh Mac, I told Rocky to drop it, but he didn't.. He got what he needed at the moment.\" Ginger smiled. \"Tis more then that.\" Mac sobbed. \"Im sorry about all the failed plans at tee farm! If I had done better, we'd had been outta there so much ealier..\" \"Mac..\" Ginger said sadly and gave her friend a hug, which Mac returned, sobbing into Ginger's shoulder. \"I shoulda done more ta save Mary! I shoulda.. I shoulda!\" Mac cried into Ginger's shoulder. \"Theres nothing you could have done Mac... you've got to let it go.\" Ginger said soothingly, running her hand around on Mac's back in a relaxing motion. \"Aye, I should, but I just can't!\" Mac whispered. \"Tis like the old Scottish sayen.. ' To a Scot, the past clings like sand to wet feet, and is carried about as a burden. The many ghosts are always a part of them, inescapable.' \" \"Alexander Smith?\" Ginger asked, knowing that talking off topic always helped Mac cheer up. \"Geddes MacGregor, actually.\" Mac sniffled, lifting her head. \"Thanks fer coming all the wah out here fer meh, Ginger.\" \"Anytime,anyplace for you Mac.\" Ginger smiled. She took Mary's scarf and tied it around Mac's quickly slipped back under her yellow one after Ginger let go of it. \"Do you want to go back home now?\" \"Ah don't know... everybody will stare at meh... Im sucha Gawk!\" Mac sighed saddly, but Ginger was alreay standing, reaching down to Mac with her outsreached hand. \"No your not. Im sure everyone will understand. You'll see Mac.\" Ginger smiled. Mac looked up at her hand, before she took it in her own and was help to her feet. \"Now lets go back home.\" They were both getting closer to the town, Ginger could tell that Mac was still embaressed. She suffled slowly behind Ginger at the pace any snail or turtle could match, but Ginger suffled with her, determend to get Mac back safe and sound. All the while she was boiling. Hundreds of wonderful idea popped into her head about how she could punish Rocky. It wasn't that he had dissobayed a direct order. It wasn't that he had went behind her back, just to get what he wanted. If it were, she wouldn't have visions of cleavers dancing around in her head. It was mostly because he had hurt one of her friend's feelings. They had worked so hard to escape. Babs, Bunty and especially Mac were more then friends. They were like sister. Plan after failed plan they kept their hopes of escaping up. Working with the positives and over coming the negative. They had looked forward through the dark clouds and found this place, both with their eyes and with their hearts. She wasn't about to let Rocky's mouth slash them in a way like this and get away unscathed himself. \"Maybeh i should just be crawlen back into me nest..\" Mac muttered as they caught a glimps of the town just through the trees. \"So i won't be maken more of a fool of meself..\" \"Don't be silly.\" Ginger spoke. \" Frowler still needs your help on the new coop.\" \"He'll have already asked sombodeh else. He don't want chickens with wee chic additues ta help hem. He's not a fan of the youngens..\" Mac sighed. \"Well, after you left he wasn't mad with you at all. He was more looking to wack Rocky around. \" Ginger explained. \"If he has asked for help, its because you both need it.\" Ginger entered the town and Mac, taking a breath, came with her. None of the others even sent Mac a second glance. The spectacled chicken looked around in confusion. \"Whats goen on? You'd have thought they not known..\" \"What Mac, did you think Bunty and Frowlerwould have gossiped about it?\" Ginger asked, with a soft chuckle. Mac shook her head. \"Nee, not them, but the chicks and Rooky..\" \"Bunty would have kept them quiet, you have nothing to worry about Mac.\"Ginger said softly, she reached over an took Mac's hand, squeezing it lightly \"Nobody going to find out.\" \"Ack... well, I suppose you right...\" Mac said, finally smiling. As the approached the middle of town voices could clearly be heard. \"Get off me you crazy old bird!!\" \"Not till Ginger gets back..\" \"But-\" \"You heard me you hard headed rooster!\" Mac and Ginger came over the hill to find Bunty keeping Rocky in place... by sitting on him. Mac hung her head again, obviously dreading this moment. She didn't want to look Rocky in the face at the moment.. Ginger still lead her towards Rocky, the rooster had one chance. ONE. To make this right. She wanted to see if he'd take it.. \"Were back.\" Ginger called, tugging Mac out from behind her. Bunty jumped of Rocky's back and came up to them. \"Are you alright four eyes?\" Bunty asked. Mac scuffled her feet silently, only repling with a nod.. \"Mac is fine, I believe. She just needed a moment time to herself.\" Ginger spoke. She looked over and watched as Rocky managed to his feet. \"Good, good. Look, I need to get back to my chores.\" Bunty said as she left. \"See you around.\" \"Good bye.\" Ginger waved, Mac sent her a stiff wave as well, before letting her wing fall to her side. \"Aie, Ginger... Can ah take off to?\" Mac asked. \"Well, if your really-\" \"Uh Mac?\" Both hens turned to looked at Rocky. He was twiddling his thumbs together in worry. Mac gave him a droopy look and refused to give him any eye contact. \"Yes?\" Ginger asked heatedly. Rocky muttered something, causing both Mac and Ginger perk up. \"What? Rocky we can't hear you..\" \"I said\" Rocky looked at Ginger in embarrassment. \"Sorry...\" Mac looked at him now. She gave him an unsure face. \"I don't know what I did, but you would have had a good reason to do that.\" The rooster sighed \"I shouldn't have pushed it..\" \"Nee, nee... It nee be your fault..\" Mac muttered. \" Ah should have told yee that ah don't like people ta call meh that..\" She seemed to straighten up more. \"Ah shoulda done alot a things..\" \"Well, I should get back to building the new coop.... Frowler said that is was my.. punishment...\" Rocky chuckled. \"Oh and he wanted me to tell you..\" \"Herre it comes.\" Mac whispered to Ginger, remembering what she had said before. \"That he wants you back right away.. he needs some help establishing the roof, or something.\"Rocky muttered. Mac was relatively surprised. \"Realla... he...wants meh back to help hem?\" Mac whispered. \"Well ya, whoelse could do all that stuff?\" Rocky shrugged. Mac smiled and looked back at Ginger. \"Ah better be getten back then. See ya around..\" Mac cock her head qucikly, think something over as a bigger smile grew on her face. \"Ging..\" Then she walked off toward the new coop. Ginger watched her go before looking to Rocky, giving him a glare. \"Alright, alright... What are you going to do to me?\" Rocky asked. \"Nothing actually.\" Ginger smiled \"Except you just won't be allowed to have any worms for the rest of the day.\" \"Aww come on-\" Rocky paused. \"Wait... thats it? The last time I messed up, you made me sleep outside in the rain for three days.\" \"You did the right thing. You apalogized.. thats all thats important.\" Ginger smiled. Then the three chicks from before came running up to Ginger. \"That was awsome!\" One sated, flapping about. \"Ya! Grandad Frowler always said that a british rooster could beat any Yankie one, but a Scottish hen! Aww man! And Auntie Mac at that.\" Another laughed. \"Aww, come off it. Auntie Mac is cool! Rember what she did to Simon with the catapult!\" The last yammered. \"Catapult?\" Ginger asked. \"Ya, Mum won't let her do any chick sitting jobs cause of it. She's on Frowler patrol.\" The first explained. Theses were Bunty's chicks. She had fallen for a passing stranger and had her children with him... four eggs at once! Sadly the stranger had left. \"I don't remember authorizing that.\" Ginger said, putting her hands on her hips. \"I'll just have to talk with your mum about this. Off you go.\" Ginger said shoeing them away. \"And keep this our little secret.\" \"Ok,Aunt Ginger!\" The middle on shouted and they raced off. \"I really will have to talk to Bunty..\" Ginger muttered. \"But first.\" She turned to Rocky. \"Have you learn your lesson with all this?\" \"Yep, honest and truellly!\" Rocky spoke, rasing his hand up like making and oath. \"Good. Now go help Frowler.\" Ginger ordered. As she watch him go she couldn't help but smile. There was hope for this brood yet.","LastChapter":"(This a cartoon, if anything like a chicken whistling or other unreal things happen, just remeber that.) \"What a bonnie day!!\" Mac whistled, she flicked the glasses hung over her head up,admiring the warmth of the sun and the beautiful landscape around her. \"I'd best be getting out more, picken flowoers...\" \"Or helping me with this!\" Frowler shouted, Mac turned to see the elder rooster struggling with a plank of wood. He staggered around, trying to keep the wood from falling. Mac jumped up and came to his rescue, holding up an end. \"Bout time!\" \"Yes sir.\" Mac Giggled. Lately she had been helping him out with many things, as much as Frowler hated to say it, he was getting old. The other hens were far to busy to help him with anything, taking care of the chicks. Mac would have been too, she loved the wee ones, but after.. the incident involving the catapult... Bunty had put her on the side lines. Ginger didn't know and Mac didn't intend to tell her.. It hurt not to be trusted, it hurt more to lose Ginger's trust then anyone elses. They weren't best friends without a good reason. \"Mac! Mac!\" Frowler shouted. Mac had subconscious drop her side of the board in her deep thoughts. Yet before Mac could respond by taking the board again a pair of wings already help them up. \"Easy old man! Don't want to blow a gasket.\" Rocky chuckled, helping the elder with the plank. Mac quickly too the board in her wings as well. \"Im so sorrie Frowler!! I-\" \"Hey, Red! Come here and give us a hand.\" Rocky shouted, a young ginger red rooster ran up to them. Around his neck was a reddish black bandana. \"Ok Dad.\" Red said and took the plank in his wings as well. \"I wouldn't need all this help if 'some-one stopped staring off into space!\" Frowler snarled at Mac, she sighed sadly. \"I said I was sorry!\" Mac frowned. \"High aunty Mac!\" Red shouted, taking first notice of her. The little rooster often spent time with her out of a curious nature. The two were often going on long walk with his sister and mother, looking at the plant life and such. \"Enough chit chat!\" Frowler ordered. \"To the new coop.\" \"Yes sir..\" The other groaned. Mac wheezed the entire way to the new coop. All the coops were now named instead of numbered. With the expanding number of chickens they were forced to build new coops to accommodate. So far, the new unnamed coop was almost down, just a few touches were need to finish it. They managed to get inside the structure and dropped the board into place on the floor. \"Perfect fit, and the last floor board needed. I'll collect the sticks needed for the steps, you all will nail this in.\" Frowler ordered. The elder rooster then strutted from the coop. \"Hm, lucky old coot. What make him think he's incharge?\" Rocky asked as he drug a bag on nails over and began to pound them into the floor. \"He's an old lad. But he nee be admit it.\" Mac spoke sadly. \"All that benden and hammeren be hard on his old bones..\" \" I swear, after all this time I still cannot under stand you..\" Rocky mumbled. \"She said that Frowler can't hammer so her gave the job to you, so he wouldn't hurt his pride he made it sound like an order.\" Red explained, handing his father another nail. \"Thanks..\" Rocky muttered. He looked out the door after Frowler. \"I still say he shouldn't be giving out orders.\" \"Aye, the old lad be a bossy badger, but he still be apart a this family.\" Mac smiled, looking down at Rocky. \"I'll wanten to be off, he may need a wee bit a help out thare.\" She spoke before heading out the door. \"Where she going?\" Rocky asked in an annoyed fashion. Red did a face palm. \"Dad, you never, ever try to understand her!\" Red frowned. \"In order for that to happen, I need to stop translating.\" \"Alright, Alright! I'll try to understand what she says. Geeze, understanding my old buddy Mac, in America, wasn't this hard.\" Rocky stated. \"Was she pretty?\" Red asked out of curiosity. He was surprised by his fathers sudden laughter. \"He, Red. Mac was a he.\"Rocky chuckled. \"It couldn't have been. Mac is a girls name.\" Red argued. \"No, its a boy's name.\" Rocky said. Red puffed out his plumage in confusion. \"Then why is auntie Mac named Mac?\" Red questioned, crossing his arms. \"Its obviously... I mean she must be... maybe..\" Rocky cocked his head to one side. \"You know... I never thought of that.\" Rocky scratch his chin and a smile spread over his beak. \"I need to see your mother for a second Red, finish nailing this for me.\" Then Rocky was out the door, leaving Red with a bag of nails, a hammer, and a few puzzling thoughts. \"Thats it Libby! You just knitted your first scarf !\" Babs cheered. Beside her was a tiny hen, just growing out of chic hood, some yellow feathers still clung to her coat. Her other feathers were a brown color with the rare red father sticking out. \"Yippe! Oh Mum look at my Scarf!\" Libby shouted, running over to her mother in excitement. \"Very good Libby. Do you need some help getting it on?\" Ginger asked her daughter. The young hen nodded eagerly. With a soft smile, Ginger took the sloppily knit, pink scarf and put around Libby's neck. \"How dose it look?\" Libby asked. Ginger chuckled. \"Like a princess.\" \"Ya!! Did you hear that aunt Babs!\" Libby shouted, running back to babs in pure joy. Ginger rolled her eyes softly and was about to get back to grain harvesting.. when her mate used this time to burst in on her. \"Ginger!\" Rocky shouted as he made his way towards her at break neck speed. Ginger sighed, at least she knew where Libby got it from.. \"Hey Ginger,i have a question for you.\" \"So ask it.\" Ginger shrugged, beginning to pick more grain stocks. \"Why is Mac,called Mac?\" Rocky asked. Ginger looked up at him in confusion. \"Its her name silly..\" Ginger frowned. \"No-no! I mean, why dose everyone call her Mac, I mean it's a boy's name. \" Rocky said, trying again. \"Is it short for something?\" Ginger stiffened, she looked away. \"It is a short form.\" \"For what? \" Rocky asked. Ginger stepped away from him. \"I, I don't know..\" She muttered. Rocky frowned, Ginger wouldn't give him any eye contact, and her feathers were ruffling. The sure signs of and amateur liar. \"Do you think the others might know?\" Rocky asked slyly. Ginger slammed her grain basket down to the ground and rounded on him. \"Drop it, Rocky!\" She ordered. \"This is a difficult subject.\" \"Aww, come on-\" \"Daddy! Look at my Scarf!\" \"Thats nice sweety-pea.\" Rocky said, not even looking. \"What makes it a difficult-\" \"You didn't even look!\" With a sigh, Rocky turned to looked at Libby. It wasn't that he didn't love his daughter. It was just that he was slightly busy. \"Wow Sweety-Pea, its even pretty then I imagined.\" Rocky shouted before turning back to Ginger, only to find that she was already gone. \"Great. Now who can I ask?\" \"Hey Babs! Have you seen Mac around here?\" \"Bunty!!\" Rocky smiled whipping around to chase after her. \" Macy!\" \"No..\" \"Mackenzie?\" \"No.\" \"MacKena!\" \"No! No! No!\" Bunty said, glaring at him. \"Look, even if you guess right I won't tell you.\" \"Awww. Why!?!\" \"I swear, your like a chic yourself... cause its difficult.\" Bunty frowned. She snarled when Rocky opened his mouth again. \"Guess one more time and I'll rip each and everyone your tail feathers out!\" Rocky jumped back always. \"Sheesh, are you cold or what?\" Before Bunty could begin to counter that, Libby came running up. \"Aunt Bunty! Look at my scarf! I made it myself!\" \"Its very nice dear.\" Bunty said, forgetting Rocky completely. \"Do you want to go for cookies?\" \"Ya! Ya! Ya!\" Libby cheered and let Bunty lead her away. \"Hey! I was..\"Rocky began but they were already gone. \"Asking you a question...\" He finished sleepily. The rooster began to think. There had to be someone who'd give him an answer! It had to be someone forgetful.. slightly dim... \"Rocky! Could you give me a hand with my wool!!\" Rocky smiled. \"Perfect.\" \"So I said to her, I says ' You can't be right'! Oh but you know Maybel, always has to have the last word! So I tried to tell her otherwise but she'd have none of it, ya see.\" Rocky slumped down in his seat as Babs yammered on about things he didn't really need to know. His wings were held out with wool loosely rapped around for Bab's to knit with. The hen didn't seem to notice that Rocky was glaring at her as she knitted a blanket for some one named Patty. Rocky rolled his eyes for the hundredth time . \"Uh, Babs..\" \"Yes Rocky, what is it? Am I running low on wool?\" Babs asked. \"Or is it something else?\" \"Something else.\" Rocky said, thinking something up quickly. \" See I made Mac a cake for... um... all her help...\" \"With the new coop? How nice.\" Babs nodded. \"Uh, ya, ok. Lets go with that.\" Rocky chuckled. \"But the lettering is a little uneven. I mean the top says 'Thanks for all your help' but the bottom only say Mac! I mean its like making an uneven number of.... stitches and pearls!\" \"My thats not good.. what are you going to do?\" Babs asked. \"Well, I wanted to put her full name at the bottom..\" Rocky smiled. \"But I have no clue what it is... I was wondering if you could tell me what it -\" \"Oh no!\" Babs gasped, dropping her knitting. \"I can't! \" \"Ah come on Babs!\" Rocky whined. \"I just want to know her full name... for the pie!\" \"You said it was a cake.\" Babs frowned. \"Ah.. its a pie cake?\" Rocky smiled cheesly. Luckily for him Babs bought it. \"Pie Cake? Never had on of those...\" Babs spoke, licking her beak. \"Uh, my own special recipe.. thats why I want the first one to look as perfect as it tastes!!\" Rocky explained. \"I mean, how much would the others want one if it looked uneven?\" \"Most likly about as much a sloppily knit hat..\" Babs frowned. She sat quietly for a moment \"Macklyn.\" \"What?\" Rocky asked. \"Her name. Its Macklyn.\" Babs said, picking up her knitting. \"But whatever you do, don't call her by her full name or-\" Babs looked over to find that Rocky was already gone. \"Else..\" Mac was helping Frowler carry some sticks to the new coop. They were just making there way through the Quietest part of the chicken's busy town. \"Back in the RAF, everyone would have help make new bunkers! Why I recall when we were setting up a new one just outside of St Malo France! \" Frowler said as he walked by some chicks playing a game of tiddly winks. \" We all lent a helping hand with construction and setting up the beds!\" Mac tried to listen the best she could, but Frowler's loud and often bland voice began to slurr the words together. She smiled at the Chicks as she walked by herself. They paid her no attention, to enveloped in their game. She looked back out infront of her, only to bang into Frowler. \"Bah!\" He clucked as he fell over. Mac toppling over him. Her glasses flew off and clattered off some place. The chicks began to cheep in laughter at the sight of them. Mac didn't see what as so funny. Especially with her glasses off. \"Corn swallop! Get off me you blind turkey!\" Frowler snarled. Mac leaped up only to have her foot catch on a roller blade behind her. She flipped backward and hit the ground with a loud thump. Frowler took no notice of her tumble as he got up himself. Luckily the chicken around them came to their aide. \"Are you alright Mac?\" \"Fine Ginger.\" Mac muttered as she was helped up. All she could see of Ginger was a red blob, but she knew her friend's voice anywhere.. \"Heres your glasses!\" Bunty's voice came this time and her specks were once again looped around her head, the hanging glass frames swung down infront of her eyes. She once again could make out the world. \"Aye, thank you kindly!\" Mac smiled, she began to bend down. Picking up her sticks, Ginger ran over to a few sticks that had gone a few feet during the fall. Rocky came up from behind them, he was smiling slyly. Now he could prove how useful his skills of getting information were to Ginger, who personally though he didn't have any at all. He made out Mac in the distance, with Ginger and Bunty off to the side. Why not get two birds with one stone!? He could prove his intellect to both Ginger and Bunty at the same time. He made his way up behind Mac, just a few paces from where she was bending over. Picking the first stick. \"Hey! Your doing a good job there!\" Rocky smiled \"Macklyn!\" Silence dawned on the chickens. Mac froze right where she was. Ginger, Bunty and even Frowler was gapping at him in shock. \"What?\" Mac asked suddenly. \"What did you say?\" \"I said ' Your doing a good job.' \" Rocky repeated. \"Oh, for a moment I thought you'd be callen me-\" \"Macklyn.\" Rocky finished. SMACK!! Rocky yelped, holding his head in pain. Mac was on him in a second. She used the stick she had been picking up to smack him upside the head repeatedly, knowing what little upper body strength she had. Her blows with the stick were piracies, but they lacked any power behind them. Suddenly Mac was tackled out of the way. She was rolled onto to stomach a few feet away, Ginger was up before Mac and ripped the stick out of her hand. \"Mac! Calm down!\" Ginger ordered. Mac looked up at her, and back to everyone else. All eyes were on her.. including the chicks. Who were now huddled behind Frowler in fear. Mac sat up quietly and everyone around her tensed. Mac could feel the memories welling up in the back of her mind. Why didn't she just stay in her nest today! Emotions all came at once and before anyone could stop her Mac ran off into the woods. Rocky slowly sat up, everyone was staring off to where Mac had disappeared. \"What was her problem?\" Mac asked. SMACK! \"Oww!\" Rocky whined after the stick Ginger had flung hit him square in the head. \"I told you to drop it!!\" Ginger spat at him as she got closer. \"But no, oh no! You just couldn't , could you!!!\" \"Geeze doll face! Why are you so-\" \"Its Ginger!! We've been together a year and you can't get that threw your head!\" Ginger growled, she whisked around to Bunty. \"Bunty, keep him with you till I get back! I need to Find Mac.\" \"Macklyn.\" Rocky said, which earned him another wap, this time form Frowler. \"In all my years I have NEVER seen such a disrespect for another birds feeling!\" Frowler stated, Rocky flinched back slightly. \" Its clear that it hurt Mac's feeling! Yet you just keep going on about!\" \"Wow, Gramps.. Never took you as a feeling sort of guy..\" Rocky spoke. \"Hmm.\" Was the only answer he got. \"Right, I'll be right back.\" Ginger said and ran off after Mac. Mac sat on a log, over looking the lake, separating them from the rest of the world. She kicked a nearby rock over the edge and into the water.. It didn't make her feel better about what had just happened though.. \"Wheh am I such a bugger?\" Mac sighed. She didn't mean to have that happen.. it just that her full name.. Macklyn.. Only her sister could call her that... All the chickens on Tweety's farm crowed around a new pair of chickens. One was slightly older then the other. Her feathers were white with small black splotches and she dawned a blue, tartan patterned scarf. The other was smaller, pure white and had a yellow, tartan scarf. Her cock's comb was sticking out all over the place, but was held out of her eyes by a pair of glasses. She was huddled behind the larger one in shyness. \"Hello Lassies!\" The large one smiled giving them a wave.. One brave ginger red chicken waved back. \"Um, hello.\" She smiled. \"I be called Mary and this is my younger sister Macklyn!\" Mary said, marching up to the ginger hen, her sister keeping close behind her all the way. All the other chickens took steps back, all but the ginger red one. \"And what would yee be called.?\" \"Ginger.\" Ginger smiled. \"Pleasure thare Ginger!\" Mary spoke, snatching Ginger's wing and shaking it enthusiastically. Ginger seemed surprised, but let her continue. \"Like wise.\" Ginger said, finally shaking back. \"What brings you two to Tweety's farm? Can't be her kindness.\" \"Not a boonie farmer? Aye, thats too bad.\" Mary sighed. \"Thee reason were here is that, our owner be grinen us down from Scotland and traden us with the farmer's here for other chickens. Get new blood in the coops, I spose.\" \"Really? Well I guess that explains why Suzen and Tallie were taken away. Was your old farm.. nice?\" Ginger asked. \"Grass and such?\" \"Aye, a bonnie, bonnie farm she was. Still is.\" Mary nodded. \"So ah.. how musch longer till we be heading off to your farm?\" Mary asked, Looking around at the chain fence and dogs staring at them through it. At this Ginger's smile grew sad. \"Im afraid this is it..\" Ginger sighed. The younger one looked around in fight, her older sister more in disgust. \"You be pullen my tail feathers! You mean you live here?!\" Mary frowned. \"What a load of hornswaddle!\" \"I know.. here, I'll show you around.\" Ginger smiled. It had been a week since the Scottish sisters had arrived. All the chickens now were un-afraid to go near them. Yet Mary was still flustered with having to live in such a muck hole. Ginger, now trusting her more then before, shared her plans of escape with Mary in a meeting with her friends. \"Thats how we do it! We'll make a hole in the fence!\" Ginger finished. The others looked at her in disbelief. \"How are we going to do that?!\" Bunty scowled. \"Bite through it?\" \"I haven't gotten to that yet..\" Ginger frowned. \"This is whats always keeping us from using your plans. Theres no proof that it will work, theres a hole in it or it just seems so.. undo able.\" Babs said. Mary scratched her chin. \"I think I be knowen some chicken with the know how.\" Mary smiled. \"Thats nice but we can't go all the way to Scotland to get them.\"Bunty scowled. \"We don't need to.\" Mary said \" I'll be right back\" Mary stood up and made her way to the door. Ginger jumped up and went after her, catching her when she had one foot out the door. \"Who is it?\" Ginger asked, slightly worried. She had only known Mary for a week and was beginning to worry about letting Mary come to the meeting. \"Trust me.\"Mary winked and was out the door. Ginger sighed and went back up to the table with her plan on it. They waited a few more minutes before the door opened again. They all stiffened, waiting for the farmer's head to appear through the roof, but instead Mary entered, Macklyn at her side. She shyly hide behind her sister again. \"Your little sister.\" Bunty frowned. \"She may be wee, but she be Ginger's age.\"Mary responded.\"Sides, she a smarter any other chicken out thare.\" Mary took Macklyn's wing and lead her up to the table.\"Nee be shy Macklyn! Ging and Babbies won't bite. But with Bunt I nee be sure..\" Mary laughed at the last part, while Bunty gave her a sour glare. \"We need to figure out how to cut through the wire fence.\" Ginger explained, looking at Macklyn. \"We can't use our teeth, but we were hoping you could give use some help.\" Macklyn looked over the poorly drawn plan, Bunty rolled her eyes. \"See, she doesn't know either.\" \"Wire cutters or bolt cutter could work.\" Macklyn said suddenly. \"Ive seen Mr Tweety come in with them on his tool belt everyday this week.\" \"Brillient!\" Mary smiled. \"What do you think Ging?\" \"That would work.\" Ginger spoke. \"But how do we get the cutters!\" Bunty asked. \"Not like he'll give em to us!\" \"We'll use a stick with gum on it.\" Ginger spoke. \"It will pull the cutters out, no problom.\" \"We'll need a stick about a foot long with a die-am-terr of two centimeters.\" Macklyn spoke. \"Or a rra-day-us of one centimeter. The gums goen to have to be at lest under five minutes from the mouth ta be sticky enough to get a good hold.\" Everyone was silent.. Till Ginger spoke again. \"Um,right...lets go get a stick just like Macklyn described... any questions?\" \"Whats a die-am-terr and a rra-day-us ?\" Babs asked. (Diameter, radius) All the chickens watched as Mr Tweety entered the pen a week later. At last Mr Tweety came in chewing some gum, his tool belt hanging from his pants. \"Ginger. Are you ready?\" Mary asked as the braced themselves to begin. \"Ready as I'll ever be.\" Ginger spoke. \"You?\" \"Yep, lets go!\" Mary smiled, leading Ginger out, right behind Mr Tweety, jumping at his legs. \"WHA! What the!\" Mr Tweety gasped, spitting out his gum. Ginger and Mary stopped imidiutly and scurried away, making sure Mr Tweety never new it was them. \"Huh, bloodie chikens..\" Mr Tweety muttered and went back to work. \"We got the gum!\" Bunty said as she and Babs came up to Mary and Ginger. \"Now where is the stick?\" \"Macklyn!\"Mary called, the smaller white chicken came out of coop 17 carrying a foot long stick. \"Boonie lass!\" Mary praised taking the stick, and taking the gum from Babs , putting the gum on the end of the stick. \"Lets get those cutters..\" Ginger smiled. Together the group snuck up on Mr Tweety from behind, they raised the stick up and stuck the gum to the wire cutters, pulling it flawlessly out of it space. \"We did it!\" Babs whispered. The others made a silent cheer, dropped the stick and took the wire cutters into coop 17. Silently that night, the chickens raced over to the fence, waiting until after Mr Tweety had gone back inside to try the plan. \"By my caculations, well be needing two chickens to cuts the wires at once.\" Macklyn explained. The others nodded, and set the wire cutters into the fence. Mary and Bunty each took a handle, pushing them together. Snapping the wire. \"Its working!\" Ginger smiled. \"Well be free this time tomorrow!\" They had managed to make half a hole in the fence, Mary and Bunty almost had the last wire cut.... BARK! BARK! BARK! \"Abort mission! Abort mission!\" Ginger ordered as she and the others race to their coops, dropping the wire cutters on the Tweety race out of the house. \"What is it boys?\" Mr Tweety breathed as he quickly got outside. \"Was it foxes?\" The dog only pointed to a small hole in the fence. \"What the?\"Mr Tweety muttered, entering the pen he could make out his bolt cutters on the ground. He picked them up and rolled them over in his hands. \"I though I looked all over for these..\" With a shrug, Mr Tweety left the pen and set a large piece of wood infront of the hole, before going back inside. \"Darn it.\" Ginger cursed, looking out the window.. she turned back to everyone else in her coop. \"Time for plan B.\" \"Its be silly plan!\" Macklyn said as the Chickens were starting to begin operation Open Gate. The plan was simple, put a brick in the gate to keep it from closing, then have everyone escape at once.. it was easy and simple, but it looked like only Macklyn knew the down side of this plan. \"It nee be silly.\" Mary frowned \"It be brilliant.\" \"You mean dangerous!\" \"Just a wee bit.\" Mary shrugged. \"Oh look, Ginger is goen fer it!\" All the chickens watched as Ginger threw a brick between the gate door and it's latch, the gate banged to a stop, but Mr Tweety took no notice. \"There, now what do you say!\" Mary asked \"Plan work like a charm.\" \"You mean a curse!\" Macklyn said. \"Mary if the door be open, we can be getten out! But other thians can be getten in!\" As if on cue the two dogs burst into the pen, with neither Tweety to keep them in check they began to attack. \"Run!\" Bunty shouted. All the chickens took off for their coops. Macklyn watched as one raced straight for her, her feet almost glued to the ground in fear. Then Mary pushed her out of the way. Macklyn watch in horror as the dog snapped his teeth around her wing. \"Ginger! Get my sister outta here!!\" Mary shouted as she punched the dog in the nose. The dog snarled and shook his head, dislocating Mary's wing with it. \"ACK!!!\" \"Mary!\" Macklyn shouted tearfully, she jumped up and was about to help when Ginger grabbed her wing and began to drag her away. \"Noo!!\" Ginger shut her eyes and pulled the chicken her age up to the wall of a coop. With a quick bang on the wall, it was pulled down and the two were whisked inside. They both hit the ground inside the coop, just as Mary's screams got worse. Macklyn was on her feet again. \"Mary!\" She cried,running for the exit of the coop. \"Stop! Macklyn!\" Ginger Shouted. Two large hens body slammed Macklyn to the floor, the blow sending her glasses smacking into her face. She struggled around, in agony. Her sister was being torn to shreds outside and there was nothing she could do about it. \"I say! What is all the commotion out there!\" Frowler asked, having been drugging into the closet coop by some hens. \"Sounds like the dogs are attacking a cat or something!\" \"Its.. they're attacking Mary..\" Ginger said, hanging her head in guilt. It had been her plan that had gotten Mary attacked. \"Oh dear..\" Frowler muttered. The screams died out, as human voices came, along with a dog whimpering. Then the roof opened up, to show Mr Tweety's face. He reached inside and pulled Macklyn out from under the two hens. She sent a withering look to Ginger before she was completely outside.. Mr Tweety raced back to Mrs Tweety, Macklyn in hand. \"See Mrs Tweety! We still have one Dorking from Scottland left!\"Mr Tweety smiled sheepishly as Mrs Tweety took Macklyn from his hands. \"Its a good thing we ordered two!\" \"We paid money for this scrawny thing?\" Mrs Tweety asked. Mr Tweety gulped. \"Ah, not as much as the other one..\" \"But we did still pay.\" Mrs Tweety growled, she threw Macklyn to the ground. \" I am sick an tired of you spending our money.\" \"But-\" \"The cost of these birds are coming out of your coffee funds Mr Tweety!\" Mrs Tweety frowned and stormed out of the pen. Mr Tweety scowled and looked down at the two dogs. \"You two start this mess. If you hadn't come in the pen then she wouldn't have found out about this little money mix up! What comes out of my coffee funds, comes out of your treat fund!\" The dogs both whined sadly. Mr Tweety picked up a black garbage bag beside him, that had blood dripping from the corners, and lead the two hounds from the cage. Macklyn got up on her knees and watch Mr Tweety sadly as he left. After he was gone she leap up and looked around for her sister. \"Mary?\" She whisper shouted. \"Mary?\" Macklyn craned her neck around , she could make out the place where the dog had attacked her, there was blood all over the ground. Macklyn took a step away from the stop, but stopped when she saw something blowing around on the ground. She ran up and picked it up, ignoring the blood overed ground that her feet were soaking in. Mary's scarf.... or what was left of it... She never went anywhere without it... Mary was... gone.... Macklyn fell down on her knees and began to weep into the bloody scarf. Some chicken peeked out of their coops, but spotting her went back in. Macklyn was both happy and upset that they did this... happy no one would see her cry, but upset that no one would comfort her... till a hand was lain on her shoulder. Macklyn looked up to see Ginger looked down at her sadly.. \"Do you want to go for a walk?\" She asked. Macklyn paused for a moment, before nodding her head. She let Ginger lead her away from the bloody mess, towards a log on the far side of the compound, they both crawled inside, giving them some privacy. \"She's gone...\" Macklyn whispered... Ginger looked at the scarf in her hands before looking at her feet. \"Its all my fault Macklyn...It was my plan..\" Ginger sighed. \"No.\" \"What?\" Ginger asked, looking up at Macklyn. \"No, it not be your fault. I should a warned her better. I should a run instead standen around, waiten for him ta get meh.\" Macklyn sighed. \"But Macklyn..\" \"No.\" Macklyn said harsher this time. \"I'll nee be called Macklyn any longer..\" \"Why is that?\" Ginger asked sadly. \"Mary.. she gave everyboda a nick name... all but me... she said it was cuse our mum let er name meh. Only she can call meh Macklyn.... from now on..\" Macklyn spoke, she stared down at the scarf in sadness.. \"Well, I suppose its only right to give you a nickname then.\" Ginger said. \"How about.... chick or Poullet?\" \"No, they sound stupid..\" Macklyn said. \"How about a spin off of your name... like Mac?\" Ginger asked. \"I like that one..\"Mac admitted, she rubbed the scarf around in her hands... Ginger watch Mac a moment longer before sighing. \"Mac, Im so sorry.. Maybe we should just put all this escaping business behind us..\" \"We'll have nee of that!\" Mac frowned, catching Ginger off guard. \"Mary wanted to get outta here just a much as everyone else. She died to have that happen. We'll nee let it be for nuthen, this time we must be more carefel.\" Ginger smiled. \"I heard that.\" Mac looked back down at Ginger. \"Whats the plan?\" Ginger frowned again.\"Well, Im no good at making good plans..\" \"Yes ya are.\" Mac stated. \"You just need ta go over everything ta find probloms. Im your chicken for that job! Sides.\" Mac reached out her hand for Ginger to take. \"Im not very good at maken plans meself...\" Mac gave a sad smile. \" Whats the plan?\" She repeated. Ginger looked back at Mac, looking threw her glasses into her amber brown eyes, before taking her out streched hand. Mac sniffled, as a more tears joined the river bending down her cheeks. She reached under her yellow scarf, pulling a dried blood covered blue one out from under it. She rubbed it in her hands, looking it over for a moment, before breaking down in a blubbering mess. She barriedher head in the crusty cotton of her sister's scarf. Inhaling the smell of old blood and her sister's feathers. Mac's shoulder shook slightly as she sobbed. Then a hand was lain on her them... Mac looked up.. It was Ginger.. again. \"Oh, Ginger.\" Mac whimpered. \"Im so sorry about attacken hem and hit hem and.. all the other stuff I buggered up!!\" \"Oh Mac, I told Rocky to drop it, but he didn't.. He got what he needed at the moment.\" Ginger smiled. \"Tis more then that.\" Mac sobbed. \"Im sorry about all the failed plans at tee farm! If I had done better, we'd had been outta there so much ealier..\" \"Mac..\" Ginger said sadly and gave her friend a hug, which Mac returned, sobbing into Ginger's shoulder. \"I shoulda done more ta save Mary! I shoulda.. I shoulda!\" Mac cried into Ginger's shoulder. \"Theres nothing you could have done Mac... you've got to let it go.\" Ginger said soothingly, running her hand around on Mac's back in a relaxing motion. \"Aye, I should, but I just can't!\" Mac whispered. \"Tis like the old Scottish sayen.. ' To a Scot, the past clings like sand to wet feet, and is carried about as a burden. The many ghosts are always a part of them, inescapable.' \" \"Alexander Smith?\" Ginger asked, knowing that talking off topic always helped Mac cheer up. \"Geddes MacGregor, actually.\" Mac sniffled, lifting her head. \"Thanks fer coming all the wah out here fer meh, Ginger.\" \"Anytime,anyplace for you Mac.\" Ginger smiled. She took Mary's scarf and tied it around Mac's quickly slipped back under her yellow one after Ginger let go of it. \"Do you want to go back home now?\" \"Ah don't know... everybody will stare at meh... Im sucha Gawk!\" Mac sighed saddly, but Ginger was alreay standing, reaching down to Mac with her outsreached hand. \"No your not. Im sure everyone will understand. You'll see Mac.\" Ginger smiled. Mac looked up at her hand, before she took it in her own and was help to her feet. \"Now lets go back home.\" They were both getting closer to the town, Ginger could tell that Mac was still embaressed. She suffled slowly behind Ginger at the pace any snail or turtle could match, but Ginger suffled with her, determend to get Mac back safe and sound. All the while she was boiling. Hundreds of wonderful idea popped into her head about how she could punish Rocky. It wasn't that he had dissobayed a direct order. It wasn't that he had went behind her back, just to get what he wanted. If it were, she wouldn't have visions of cleavers dancing around in her head. It was mostly because he had hurt one of her friend's feelings. They had worked so hard to escape. Babs, Bunty and especially Mac were more then friends. They were like sister. Plan after failed plan they kept their hopes of escaping up. Working with the positives and over coming the negative. They had looked forward through the dark clouds and found this place, both with their eyes and with their hearts. She wasn't about to let Rocky's mouth slash them in a way like this and get away unscathed himself. \"Maybeh i should just be crawlen back into me nest..\" Mac muttered as they caught a glimps of the town just through the trees. \"So i won't be maken more of a fool of meself..\" \"Don't be silly.\" Ginger spoke. \" Frowler still needs your help on the new coop.\" \"He'll have already asked sombodeh else. He don't want chickens with wee chic additues ta help hem. He's not a fan of the youngens..\" Mac sighed. \"Well, after you left he wasn't mad with you at all. He was more looking to wack Rocky around. \" Ginger explained. \"If he has asked for help, its because you both need it.\" Ginger entered the town and Mac, taking a breath, came with her. None of the others even sent Mac a second glance. The spectacled chicken looked around in confusion. \"Whats goen on? You'd have thought they not known..\" \"What Mac, did you think Bunty and Frowlerwould have gossiped about it?\" Ginger asked, with a soft chuckle. Mac shook her head. \"Nee, not them, but the chicks and Rooky..\" \"Bunty would have kept them quiet, you have nothing to worry about Mac.\"Ginger said softly, she reached over an took Mac's hand, squeezing it lightly \"Nobody going to find out.\" \"Ack... well, I suppose you right...\" Mac said, finally smiling. As the approached the middle of town voices could clearly be heard. \"Get off me you crazy old bird!!\" \"Not till Ginger gets back..\" \"But-\" \"You heard me you hard headed rooster!\" Mac and Ginger came over the hill to find Bunty keeping Rocky in place... by sitting on him. Mac hung her head again, obviously dreading this moment. She didn't want to look Rocky in the face at the moment.. Ginger still lead her towards Rocky, the rooster had one chance. ONE. To make this right. She wanted to see if he'd take it.. \"Were back.\" Ginger called, tugging Mac out from behind her. Bunty jumped of Rocky's back and came up to them. \"Are you alright four eyes?\" Bunty asked. Mac scuffled her feet silently, only repling with a nod.. \"Mac is fine, I believe. She just needed a moment time to herself.\" Ginger spoke. She looked over and watched as Rocky managed to his feet. \"Good, good. Look, I need to get back to my chores.\" Bunty said as she left. \"See you around.\" \"Good bye.\" Ginger waved, Mac sent her a stiff wave as well, before letting her wing fall to her side. \"Aie, Ginger... Can ah take off to?\" Mac asked. \"Well, if your really-\" \"Uh Mac?\" Both hens turned to looked at Rocky. He was twiddling his thumbs together in worry. Mac gave him a droopy look and refused to give him any eye contact. \"Yes?\" Ginger asked heatedly. Rocky muttered something, causing both Mac and Ginger perk up. \"What? Rocky we can't hear you..\" \"I said\" Rocky looked at Ginger in embarrassment. \"Sorry...\" Mac looked at him now. She gave him an unsure face. \"I don't know what I did, but you would have had a good reason to do that.\" The rooster sighed \"I shouldn't have pushed it..\" \"Nee, nee... It nee be your fault..\" Mac muttered. \" Ah should have told yee that ah don't like people ta call meh that..\" She seemed to straighten up more. \"Ah shoulda done alot a things..\" \"Well, I should get back to building the new coop.... Frowler said that is was my.. punishment...\" Rocky chuckled. \"Oh and he wanted me to tell you..\" \"Herre it comes.\" Mac whispered to Ginger, remembering what she had said before. \"That he wants you back right away.. he needs some help establishing the roof, or something.\"Rocky muttered. Mac was relatively surprised. \"Realla... he...wants meh back to help hem?\" Mac whispered. \"Well ya, whoelse could do all that stuff?\" Rocky shrugged. Mac smiled and looked back at Ginger. \"Ah better be getten back then. See ya around..\" Mac cock her head qucikly, think something over as a bigger smile grew on her face. \"Ging..\" Then she walked off toward the new coop. Ginger watched her go before looking to Rocky, giving him a glare. \"Alright, alright... What are you going to do to me?\" Rocky asked. \"Nothing actually.\" Ginger smiled \"Except you just won't be allowed to have any worms for the rest of the day.\" \"Aww come on-\" Rocky paused. \"Wait... thats it? The last time I messed up, you made me sleep outside in the rain for three days.\" \"You did the right thing. You apalogized.. thats all thats important.\" Ginger smiled. Then the three chicks from before came running up to Ginger. \"That was awsome!\" One sated, flapping about. \"Ya! Grandad Frowler always said that a british rooster could beat any Yankie one, but a Scottish hen! Aww man! And Auntie Mac at that.\" Another laughed. \"Aww, come off it. Auntie Mac is cool! Rember what she did to Simon with the catapult!\" The last yammered. \"Catapult?\" Ginger asked. \"Ya, Mum won't let her do any chick sitting jobs cause of it. She's on Frowler patrol.\" The first explained. Theses were Bunty's chicks. She had fallen for a passing stranger and had her children with him... four eggs at once! Sadly the stranger had left. \"I don't remember authorizing that.\" Ginger said, putting her hands on her hips. \"I'll just have to talk with your mum about this. Off you go.\" Ginger said shoeing them away. \"And keep this our little secret.\" \"Ok,Aunt Ginger!\" The middle on shouted and they raced off. \"I really will have to talk to Bunty..\" Ginger muttered. \"But first.\" She turned to Rocky. \"Have you learn your lesson with all this?\" \"Yep, honest and truellly!\" Rocky spoke, rasing his hand up like making and oath. \"Good. Now go help Frowler.\" Ginger ordered. As she watch him go she couldn't help but smile. There was hope for this brood yet.","Summary":" (This a cartoon, if anything like a chicken whistling or other unreal things happen, just remeber t","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  T - English - Hurt Comfort Friendship  - Words: 6,992 - Reviews: 3 - Favs: 5 - Published: 1 25 2010 - Status: Complete - id: 5695904 "},{"Movie":"Chicken Run","Title":"A Pretty Penny","Author":"gyorklady","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/242274","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chicken Run Prologue Disclaimer: The film Chicken Run and its chickens, from Ginger to Babs, and therntwo rats, do not belong to me.

Fear.. \"Do you think it will work?\" Ginger asked as she moved the piece of paper under Mac's beak. The slightly taller white chicken looked over the plan in fine to measure some things, before checking the rest. After Mary's parting two months ago, Mac had been down to the last detail of every plan. She recorded everything the humans and dogs did during the day on paper till she worked out some sort of schedule in her head. Mac was like a note pad herself. Jotting down information and taken a moment to find it. She remebered all the big things, and the little ones. Like looking over the nest sometimes to see who had layen eggs, all the way up to medical work. She was determined not to lose anyone else, which saddened Ginger a bit. What would Mac do to keep it from happening again and how would Mac deal with it if it did?She worried about the hen. Mac was two weeks younger then her, making Ginger feel like Mac was her responsibility. Then again this wasn't a game at the park. This was war! They had to escape from here... in order to finally be free.. Mac would have to look out for herself. \"Louks alri-ht ta meh Ginger.\" Mac said, peeking up from under her glasses, she pushed the plan back to Ginger. Ginger looked back down at the paper. Mac never went on escape missions. She was one of the ' I'll come back for you' chickens that Ginger would return for. But what could it hurt? This plan had room for more.. \"Do you want to come?\" Ginger asked. Mac was clearly caught off guard, but nodded all the same. \"Alright. Come to Coop 17 tonight and We'll go.\" Ginger decided. Mac nodded again and left the coop to prepare. Ginger rubbed her head under her hat, wondering if she was right about this not being a bad idea. Later that night.... Mac looked out over the rest of the chickens who were here to try and escape. Babs and Bunty of course, Edweena was here as well. She was a good friend of Gingers. That was it. Mac was shocked. This plan had over seventy percent of succeeding and no one else came... Or no one else was invited. Ginger's trust was hard to gain. Suddenly Ginger's mallet (Really a cork pipe) was banging down on her desk as the meeting began. \"Quite everyone.\" Ginger said and the room grew silent. \"Now take a good look around. These are all the chicken that will be escaping with us to night.\" \"What?! Four eyes is coming?\" Bunty questioned. Everyone else looked at Mac.\"She never comes. What, is it her birthday or something?\" \"Will there be a cake?\" Babs asked stupidly. \"No, it just that the plan has room in it for more then the usual amount of chickens.\" Ginger explained. \"Now here is the plan.\" Ginger flipped over a floor board and pulled out the plan, setting it on her desk for everyone to look at. \"Well be using cardboard boxes and we will sneak out of the gate using the latch. The boxes will help us get at the latch, protect us from the dogs, and hide us from plain sight.\" Ginger opened another floor board to show the chickens a small amount of boxes \"Everyone pick a box and follow my lead. All the chickens were taking their boxes to the fence as Mac explained how much time they had, with the sqedual she had conducted form watching the humans and the dogs. \" Ah'd say aboout six minutes, if whare luka.\" Mac stated. \"Thats aboout tee amount ta tam it takes hem to go around the pen there hen.\" \"So he have to hurry.\" Ginger muttered. The arrived at the gate and with Ginger's ok they piled the boxes ontop of each other till it reach the latch. Ginger began to climb the mountain of cardboard as Bunty kept the bottom form wobbling. Ginger managed to get to the top and unhinge the gate, it slowly creaked open. \"Get the boxes!\" Ginger whisper shoutted as she jumped from the pile. Each chicken took a box, Ginger and Mac both watch till only one bo was left. \"Su, am ah still goen?\" Mac asked, kicking the large box that had once held chandlier over on its side. \"Of course. Well just have to share.\" Ginger said, putting the box over their heads. She poked the eye holes out her end and looked back at Mac. \"Try and keep up, ok?\" Ginger smiled warmly \"Nervous?\" \"Well ya. Tis my fist attempt fer escape.\" Mac shrugged. \"Sopose it'll all be fine though.\" \"Good, just think free thought and we'll be out of her in no time!\" Ginger nodded. \"Come on everyone.\" Ginger ordered, looking back out of the eye holes. \"Move out!\" She skidded the box forward through the dirt, having the others follow suit. Gingerkept her eyes out till they came across the chickens next opstical. \"Right where you said he'd be Mac.\" \"Hah only takes ones dog when he doze his rownds.\" Mac spoke. \"Like alwayz\" One of the Tweety Dogs was staring at them, or some moving boxes from his point of view, he wondered up to them. A questioning gaze in his eyes. He sniffed at the boxes. It was then that an idea struck Mac, making her feel cold. \"Ah, Ginger?\" \"Yes Mac?\" \"Uh, with them noses, the wah thair pointed. Ah think that the dog could-\" Then the giant dog shoved his nose under the cardboard, flipping it over the two chickens head, exposing them. \"Flip the box..\" Mac finished. \"Go back! Go back!\" Ginger shouted, all the other squealed in panic and ran back to the safety of the pen. Ginger and Mac that their heels. Then Ginger slipped on a rock. Mac sped to a stop, looking back at her fallen comrade. The dogs had learned their lesson with Mary. Never attack the chickens. Now they just conrnered them for Mr Tweey so he could take them to the coal bin... Another thought crossed Mac's mind... Ginger had't layen any eggs for three days. Roll call was in another two days, if she didn't lay an egg by then.... she'd be sent to the chopper! Mac looked at the ground and snatch at rock that was nearby. She threw it into the air and let it slam into the dogs nose. Both he and Ginger looked over to where Mac stood. \"Come hand gat meh, you uglah, ohver growen rat!\" Mac shout, flapping her arms around to get the dog more intrested. \"Mac no!\" Ginger shouted. It was to late. The dog hurtled himself after Mac, who was leading him as far away from Ginger as possible. Ginger leaped up to try and help, but Bunty came running back to her. \"Come on Ginger!!\" The bigger bird shouted and flung the fearless leader over her shoulder. \"Bunty! Put me down! I need to help Mac!!\" Ginger shouted, but it was all in vein as Bunty raced past the gate, the others shutting it behind them. Mac was still running for her life. Her breath was starting to run out, she could hardly breath. Her legs were getting sore and were about to go out.. she really needed to get out of the pen more. Then a hand came out of nowhere and snatch her around her neck. Mac squawked at the sudden surprise but didn't fight it. She knew from what Ginger had told her that if you fool about and try to get away then you just hurt you neck. Mr Tweety pulled Mac up close for inspection, while the other watch from the fence. \"Gotcha again you.. hold on a tick.\" Mr Tweety frowned, holding up the flash light into Mac's face. \"Your not the Ginger one... your the one with the odd cock comb.. did that ginger one rope you into this escaping stuff?\" Mr Tweety asked, not really expecting an answer. \"MR TWEETY!!\" Mr Tweety jumped a foot in the air. \"ARE YOU TALKING TO THOSE CHICKENS!!!\" \"No Mrs Tweety..\"Mr Tweety whimpered. He looked back at Mac. \"Oh well, you'll just be treated like all the rest of the escapees I catch... your the second one I ever got other then the Ginger one.\" Mr Tweety sighed and carried Mac towards the coal bin. Mac gulped. She really didn't want to go in there, but then again Ginger did it every other day. How hard could it be? Mr Tweety opened the bin and dropped Mac inside. Shutting the lid behind her. Mac scuffled around, pulling her face out of the bottom of the coal dust covered bin. She moved her wing to the left and found the heap of coal stored there. Mac rubbed her eyes and opened them, only to find a great surprise. It was all black. That was all she could see. Mac checked to see if her glasses were still on, and tried to dust her eyes out a bit more. Still all she could see was darkness... then it hit her. The coal bin had no windows. No source of light... it was always dark!! The dark seemed to inclose around her. Her breathing became ragged, as if she were suffocating. Her mind couldn't think straight.. her mouth became dry and she began to shake. So this was what it was like to be alone... She hadn't felt like this before... even in the create she and her sister had taken form Scotland to England. Mac whimpered softly and she could feel heart pound in her chest. \"Mac!\" It was Mac's turn to jump a foot, she landed on the coal heap, sliding back down to the floor. \"W-w-w-w-wh-wh-who?\" Mac stuttered, she was shaking even more then from before. \"Mac! Breath and try to clam down. Its me! Ginger!\" \"Ginger?!\" Mac gasped. \"Where-Why are ya hare!\" She knew it was stupid to asked. \"Im around the back of the bin! So Mr Tweety won't see me.\" Ginger explained. She rapped on the side of the bin, alerting Mac to her where abouts. All Mac could focus on was the ringing now in her ears. \"Ah, ah don't know where ya be Ginger! Its too darck!\" Mac whimpered. \"Hold on.\" Suddenly a small hole was opened at the back of the bin, a small light shone through. \"Oh and as for the ' why am I here'question. Why do you think Im here?\" Ginger snorted. \"To comfort you.\" \"C-comfort meh?\" Mac asked,quietly as she scooted closer to the tiny light. \"Yes. I remembered my first night in the bin. It wasn't pleasant.\" Ginger explained. \"It takes a while to get use to it. From the sounds of you, you needed this.\" \"Aie, ah do.\" Mac admitted. \"Ack, its so hard ta breath in hare! And so darck too!\" \"Its the claustrophobia. Don't worry, nothing is going to hurt you in there.\" Ginger said soothingly. Mac nodded, but remembering that Ginger couldn't see her made an agreeing grunt. \"Su, whats this tinya hole?\" Mac asked, looking through it, it was big enough to get three fingers through. \"Its the cleaning hole. You fill the bin up with water and this hole drains it out.\" Ginger explained. \"But enough of that, why did you do this.\" \"This, Ginger?\" \"Why did you get yourself caught?\" Ginger answered with a question... \"Aaaaa.....\" Mac muttered, finally understanding \"Well, fer the last coople a days, ah noticed you haven't bin leyen any eggs. Ah thought that tif you had tanight then you could lay one.\" \"When have you been checking the nests?\" Ginger asked. \"Aboout six thirta every morning.\" Mac responded. Even from inside the bin Mac could tell that Ginger was shaking her head. \"Mac, I have this little nitch in my daily routine. See, when I lay an egg, I lay it at eight in the morning. You don't go back in until ten, by then Mr Tweety has it. \"Realla! Well, I saved ya one night in the coal ben.\" Mac said sadly. \"No, because Im speding the night right here.\" Ginger spoke \"I won't leave your side till the farmer is out to get you himself.\" \"Ginger ah-\" \"Shh!\" Ginger hissed, in the background Mac could make out the closing of a door... The farm house door. \"I'll be right here, but I have to put the lantern out..\" Ginger whispered, before everything went dark again. Mac managed to supress another whimper. Then the coal bin roof open to reveal Mr Tweety, he jolted slightly when he saw Mac. \"Oh right, your in here.\" He muttered, reaching down into the bin. Mac shuffled back against the wall, shivering at how cold if felt. Three warm feathered fingers were placed on her back in comfort as Mr Tweety scooped up a few lumps of cole with a bucket. \"Not long till morning.\" He muttered to her before closing the bin again. There was silence before the farm door shatter closed again. \"You alright..?\" Ginger's voice came from the darkness. Mac just continued to shake. \"Aie, A-a-ah'm fine..\" Mac whispered. \"Good, just remember to breath and try to relax..\" Ginger stuck her fingers through the hole for Mac to hang onto, Mac looped them into her own fingers.\"Its going to be a long night.\" Ginger said. After a long and sleepless night, just as Ginger had predicated, light finally began to spill into the cole bin. Mac blinked at the brightness of it. She could make out more of the bin's inners, the cole was piled to the left and there were strange marks on the wall. \"Ginger? Areh yew awake?\" \"Yes.\" Came Ginger's voice through the hole. \"Um, Ginger, what areh theze strangeh merkens on the wall?\" Mac asked, running her finger over one. \"Oh, thats how many times I'lve been locked in there.\" Ginger explained \"I put a mark on the wall for each one.\" Mac let out a whistle. \"There be a lot of merks\" \"I know, but one of these days, we'll get out of here.\" Ginger said. Then the farm door shut, once again with a bang. \"Looks like you'll be back in the pen soon. I have to go now Mac.\" \"Right..\" Mac mumbled \"Ginger, ah--\" \"Shh!!!\" Ginger whispered, then Mac could hear her foot prints echo across the lane and back to the pens.. A few moments later a small door open at the bottom of the bin. Fearfully and blinkly, Mac stepped out into the light. Mr Tweety stood there, tapping his foot. The two dog were chained to their dog houses on the other side of the yard. Mr Tweety pointed to the pen, clearly showing Mac which way he wanted her to go. Mac was more then happy to oblige. As soon as they were at the gate, Mr Tweety opened it and raised his boot, to kick her in, but was shock to watch her run in all by herself. \"Well I be tickled pink...\" Mr tweety muttered and closed the gate. As soon as Mac was in the other hens were on her. Some asking questions, others wanted to know if last night was true or not. One of them was even asking if Mac had saved Ginger's life. Mac winced at all the noise, it had been a long night, she was tired, hungry... and she felt sick from smelling coal all night long. \"Everyone! Everyone! Quite down! \" Ginger shouted as she came through the crowd, standing between Mac and the others. \"Mac has had a long, scary night and we should just let her go back to her coop. Everyone, go back to your usual.\" Ginger shooed them away with a scatting motion of her hands before looking back to Mac. \"Follow me.\" She said in an concerned but angery way. Mac followed Ginger back to coop 17 and inside. They arrived at Mac's nest. Which was just under Ginger's. \"Lay down.\" She ordered. Mac climbed into bed, pulling the covers over her legs. Much comfier. Ginger began to pace in front of the bed, Mac watching her. She was wondering what Ginger was up to..until.. \"WHAT KIND OF STUNT WAS THAT!?!?!\" Ginger screamed. Mac was caught off guard and she almost fell out of bed. \"You could have been hurt! Or you could have ended up like Mary! Do you realise how lucky you are Mr Tweety caught you! With me, they know not to attack, but you! They'd would have eaten you!\" Mac blinked, Ginger was scolding her? \"Do you know how I would have felt if you had been hurt or, egg forbid, killed! And on your first mission?!\" Ginger continued. \"When that dog took off after you, I felt sick! Watching through the fence as you were run ragged! If you want to go on anymore mission you have to shape up!\" Ginger stopped, it took a second for Mac to realize she was waiting for a response. \"Ginger..ah, donno what ta say.\"Mac said. \"Ah just did what ah thought was right at the tam... why didn't cha scold me back at the ben?\" Ginger sighed. \"It would have just made you more freaked out then you already were...Look.\" Ginger looked Mac in they eyes \"I don't want anyone to get hurt with one of my plans again and neither do you, but risking your life for me won't solve anything. Its my plans, so I risk my hide. No one elses. I take the hits, the nights in the bin, everything.\" \"Well now, that seems a wee bit unfair.\" Mac began, but was silenced by Ginger's glare. \"Mac..\" Ginger held her head, she was just as tired as Mac was, but she had to get through to her. \"If anything happened on one of my plans , to you or somebody else.., I just don't think I could continued with my plans any longer.\" Ginger sat on the end of Mac's bed. \"Do you understand?\" \"Aie, ah do.\" Mac nodded. Ginger smiled and patted Mac's feet. \"Good. Now you better try and pay an egg. Mr Tweety might give you a zero.\" Ginger said. \"Ack, I thenk the egg ah had was killed bah all tee stress of lass night.\" Mac sighed, stretching back in her bed. \"At least try.\"Ginger said, then she went to leave. Mac propped herself up on one elbow. \"Oie, Ginger!\" Mac shouted, catching Gingers attention. \"Thanks for stayen with meh.\" \"Don't worry about it. \" Ginger smiled, the shut the door behind her. Mac snuggled uner the covers of her bed. She higly doubted she'd lay an egg right now, but sleep would come much easier. FIN","LastChapter":"Only in the dark do lights shine the brightest. Fear.. \"Do you think it will work?\" Ginger asked as she moved the piece of paper under Mac's beak. The slightly taller white chicken looked over the plan in fine to measure some things, before checking the rest. After Mary's parting two months ago, Mac had been down to the last detail of every plan. She recorded everything the humans and dogs did during the day on paper till she worked out some sort of schedule in her head. Mac was like a note pad herself. Jotting down information and taken a moment to find it. She remebered all the big things, and the little ones. Like looking over the nest sometimes to see who had layen eggs, all the way up to medical work. She was determined not to lose anyone else, which saddened Ginger a bit. What would Mac do to keep it from happening again and how would Mac deal with it if it did?She worried about the hen. Mac was two weeks younger then her, making Ginger feel like Mac was her responsibility. Then again this wasn't a game at the park. This was war! They had to escape from here... in order to finally be free.. Mac would have to look out for herself. \"Louks alri-ht ta meh Ginger.\" Mac said, peeking up from under her glasses, she pushed the plan back to Ginger. Ginger looked back down at the paper. Mac never went on escape missions. She was one of the ' I'll come back for you' chickens that Ginger would return for. But what could it hurt? This plan had room for more.. \"Do you want to come?\" Ginger asked. Mac was clearly caught off guard, but nodded all the same. \"Alright. Come to Coop 17 tonight and We'll go.\" Ginger decided. Mac nodded again and left the coop to prepare. Ginger rubbed her head under her hat, wondering if she was right about this not being a bad idea. Later that night.... Mac looked out over the rest of the chickens who were here to try and escape. Babs and Bunty of course, Edweena was here as well. She was a good friend of Gingers. That was it. Mac was shocked. This plan had over seventy percent of succeeding and no one else came... Or no one else was invited. Ginger's trust was hard to gain. Suddenly Ginger's mallet (Really a cork pipe) was banging down on her desk as the meeting began. \"Quite everyone.\" Ginger said and the room grew silent. \"Now take a good look around. These are all the chicken that will be escaping with us to night.\" \"What?! Four eyes is coming?\" Bunty questioned. Everyone else looked at Mac.\"She never comes. What, is it her birthday or something?\" \"Will there be a cake?\" Babs asked stupidly. \"No, it just that the plan has room in it for more then the usual amount of chickens.\" Ginger explained. \"Now here is the plan.\" Ginger flipped over a floor board and pulled out the plan, setting it on her desk for everyone to look at. \"Well be using cardboard boxes and we will sneak out of the gate using the latch. The boxes will help us get at the latch, protect us from the dogs, and hide us from plain sight.\" Ginger opened another floor board to show the chickens a small amount of boxes \"Everyone pick a box and follow my lead. All the chickens were taking their boxes to the fence as Mac explained how much time they had, with the sqedual she had conducted form watching the humans and the dogs. \" Ah'd say aboout six minutes, if whare luka.\" Mac stated. \"Thats aboout tee amount ta tam it takes hem to go around the pen there hen.\" \"So he have to hurry.\" Ginger muttered. The arrived at the gate and with Ginger's ok they piled the boxes ontop of each other till it reach the latch. Ginger began to climb the mountain of cardboard as Bunty kept the bottom form wobbling. Ginger managed to get to the top and unhinge the gate, it slowly creaked open. \"Get the boxes!\" Ginger whisper shoutted as she jumped from the pile. Each chicken took a box, Ginger and Mac both watch till only one bo was left. \"Su, am ah still goen?\" Mac asked, kicking the large box that had once held chandlier over on its side. \"Of course. Well just have to share.\" Ginger said, putting the box over their heads. She poked the eye holes out her end and looked back at Mac. \"Try and keep up, ok?\" Ginger smiled warmly \"Nervous?\" \"Well ya. Tis my fist attempt fer escape.\" Mac shrugged. \"Sopose it'll all be fine though.\" \"Good, just think free thought and we'll be out of her in no time!\" Ginger nodded. \"Come on everyone.\" Ginger ordered, looking back out of the eye holes. \"Move out!\" She skidded the box forward through the dirt, having the others follow suit. Gingerkept her eyes out till they came across the chickens next opstical. \"Right where you said he'd be Mac.\" \"Hah only takes ones dog when he doze his rownds.\" Mac spoke. \"Like alwayz\" One of the Tweety Dogs was staring at them, or some moving boxes from his point of view, he wondered up to them. A questioning gaze in his eyes. He sniffed at the boxes. It was then that an idea struck Mac, making her feel cold. \"Ah, Ginger?\" \"Yes Mac?\" \"Uh, with them noses, the wah thair pointed. Ah think that the dog could-\" Then the giant dog shoved his nose under the cardboard, flipping it over the two chickens head, exposing them. \"Flip the box..\" Mac finished. \"Go back! Go back!\" Ginger shouted, all the other squealed in panic and ran back to the safety of the pen. Ginger and Mac that their heels. Then Ginger slipped on a rock. Mac sped to a stop, looking back at her fallen comrade. The dogs had learned their lesson with Mary. Never attack the chickens. Now they just conrnered them for Mr Tweey so he could take them to the coal bin... Another thought crossed Mac's mind... Ginger had't layen any eggs for three days. Roll call was in another two days, if she didn't lay an egg by then.... she'd be sent to the chopper! Mac looked at the ground and snatch at rock that was nearby. She threw it into the air and let it slam into the dogs nose. Both he and Ginger looked over to where Mac stood. \"Come hand gat meh, you uglah, ohver growen rat!\" Mac shout, flapping her arms around to get the dog more intrested. \"Mac no!\" Ginger shouted. It was to late. The dog hurtled himself after Mac, who was leading him as far away from Ginger as possible. Ginger leaped up to try and help, but Bunty came running back to her. \"Come on Ginger!!\" The bigger bird shouted and flung the fearless leader over her shoulder. \"Bunty! Put me down! I need to help Mac!!\" Ginger shouted, but it was all in vein as Bunty raced past the gate, the others shutting it behind them. Mac was still running for her life. Her breath was starting to run out, she could hardly breath. Her legs were getting sore and were about to go out.. she really needed to get out of the pen more. Then a hand came out of nowhere and snatch her around her neck. Mac squawked at the sudden surprise but didn't fight it. She knew from what Ginger had told her that if you fool about and try to get away then you just hurt you neck. Mr Tweety pulled Mac up close for inspection, while the other watch from the fence. \"Gotcha again you.. hold on a tick.\" Mr Tweety frowned, holding up the flash light into Mac's face. \"Your not the Ginger one... your the one with the odd cock comb.. did that ginger one rope you into this escaping stuff?\" Mr Tweety asked, not really expecting an answer. \"MR TWEETY!!\" Mr Tweety jumped a foot in the air. \"ARE YOU TALKING TO THOSE CHICKENS!!!\" \"No Mrs Tweety..\"Mr Tweety whimpered. He looked back at Mac. \"Oh well, you'll just be treated like all the rest of the escapees I catch... your the second one I ever got other then the Ginger one.\" Mr Tweety sighed and carried Mac towards the coal bin. Mac gulped. She really didn't want to go in there, but then again Ginger did it every other day. How hard could it be? Mr Tweety opened the bin and dropped Mac inside. Shutting the lid behind her. Mac scuffled around, pulling her face out of the bottom of the coal dust covered bin. She moved her wing to the left and found the heap of coal stored there. Mac rubbed her eyes and opened them, only to find a great surprise. It was all black. That was all she could see. Mac checked to see if her glasses were still on, and tried to dust her eyes out a bit more. Still all she could see was darkness... then it hit her. The coal bin had no windows. No source of light... it was always dark!! The dark seemed to inclose around her. Her breathing became ragged, as if she were suffocating. Her mind couldn't think straight.. her mouth became dry and she began to shake. So this was what it was like to be alone... She hadn't felt like this before... even in the create she and her sister had taken form Scotland to England. Mac whimpered softly and she could feel heart pound in her chest. \"Mac!\" It was Mac's turn to jump a foot, she landed on the coal heap, sliding back down to the floor. \"W-w-w-w-wh-wh-who?\" Mac stuttered, she was shaking even more then from before. \"Mac! Breath and try to clam down. Its me! Ginger!\" \"Ginger?!\" Mac gasped. \"Where-Why are ya hare!\" She knew it was stupid to asked. \"Im around the back of the bin! So Mr Tweety won't see me.\" Ginger explained. She rapped on the side of the bin, alerting Mac to her where abouts. All Mac could focus on was the ringing now in her ears. \"Ah, ah don't know where ya be Ginger! Its too darck!\" Mac whimpered. \"Hold on.\" Suddenly a small hole was opened at the back of the bin, a small light shone through. \"Oh and as for the ' why am I here'question. Why do you think Im here?\" Ginger snorted. \"To comfort you.\" \"C-comfort meh?\" Mac asked,quietly as she scooted closer to the tiny light. \"Yes. I remembered my first night in the bin. It wasn't pleasant.\" Ginger explained. \"It takes a while to get use to it. From the sounds of you, you needed this.\" \"Aie, ah do.\" Mac admitted. \"Ack, its so hard ta breath in hare! And so darck too!\" \"Its the claustrophobia. Don't worry, nothing is going to hurt you in there.\" Ginger said soothingly. Mac nodded, but remembering that Ginger couldn't see her made an agreeing grunt. \"Su, whats this tinya hole?\" Mac asked, looking through it, it was big enough to get three fingers through. \"Its the cleaning hole. You fill the bin up with water and this hole drains it out.\" Ginger explained. \"But enough of that, why did you do this.\" \"This, Ginger?\" \"Why did you get yourself caught?\" Ginger answered with a question... \"Aaaaa.....\" Mac muttered, finally understanding \"Well, fer the last coople a days, ah noticed you haven't bin leyen any eggs. Ah thought that tif you had tanight then you could lay one.\" \"When have you been checking the nests?\" Ginger asked. \"Aboout six thirta every morning.\" Mac responded. Even from inside the bin Mac could tell that Ginger was shaking her head. \"Mac, I have this little nitch in my daily routine. See, when I lay an egg, I lay it at eight in the morning. You don't go back in until ten, by then Mr Tweety has it. \"Realla! Well, I saved ya one night in the coal ben.\" Mac said sadly. \"No, because Im speding the night right here.\" Ginger spoke \"I won't leave your side till the farmer is out to get you himself.\" \"Ginger ah-\" \"Shh!\" Ginger hissed, in the background Mac could make out the closing of a door... The farm house door. \"I'll be right here, but I have to put the lantern out..\" Ginger whispered, before everything went dark again. Mac managed to supress another whimper. Then the coal bin roof open to reveal Mr Tweety, he jolted slightly when he saw Mac. \"Oh right, your in here.\" He muttered, reaching down into the bin. Mac shuffled back against the wall, shivering at how cold if felt. Three warm feathered fingers were placed on her back in comfort as Mr Tweety scooped up a few lumps of cole with a bucket. \"Not long till morning.\" He muttered to her before closing the bin again. There was silence before the farm door shatter closed again. \"You alright..?\" Ginger's voice came from the darkness. Mac just continued to shake. \"Aie, A-a-ah'm fine..\" Mac whispered. \"Good, just remember to breath and try to relax..\" Ginger stuck her fingers through the hole for Mac to hang onto, Mac looped them into her own fingers.\"Its going to be a long night.\" Ginger said. After a long and sleepless night, just as Ginger had predicated, light finally began to spill into the cole bin. Mac blinked at the brightness of it. She could make out more of the bin's inners, the cole was piled to the left and there were strange marks on the wall. \"Ginger? Areh yew awake?\" \"Yes.\" Came Ginger's voice through the hole. \"Um, Ginger, what areh theze strangeh merkens on the wall?\" Mac asked, running her finger over one. \"Oh, thats how many times I'lve been locked in there.\" Ginger explained \"I put a mark on the wall for each one.\" Mac let out a whistle. \"There be a lot of merks\" \"I know, but one of these days, we'll get out of here.\" Ginger said. Then the farm door shut, once again with a bang. \"Looks like you'll be back in the pen soon. I have to go now Mac.\" \"Right..\" Mac mumbled \"Ginger, ah--\" \"Shh!!!\" Ginger whispered, then Mac could hear her foot prints echo across the lane and back to the pens.. A few moments later a small door open at the bottom of the bin. Fearfully and blinkly, Mac stepped out into the light. Mr Tweety stood there, tapping his foot. The two dog were chained to their dog houses on the other side of the yard. Mr Tweety pointed to the pen, clearly showing Mac which way he wanted her to go. Mac was more then happy to oblige. As soon as they were at the gate, Mr Tweety opened it and raised his boot, to kick her in, but was shock to watch her run in all by herself. \"Well I be tickled pink...\" Mr tweety muttered and closed the gate. As soon as Mac was in the other hens were on her. Some asking questions, others wanted to know if last night was true or not. One of them was even asking if Mac had saved Ginger's life. Mac winced at all the noise, it had been a long night, she was tired, hungry... and she felt sick from smelling coal all night long. \"Everyone! Everyone! Quite down! \" Ginger shouted as she came through the crowd, standing between Mac and the others. \"Mac has had a long, scary night and we should just let her go back to her coop. Everyone, go back to your usual.\" Ginger shooed them away with a scatting motion of her hands before looking back to Mac. \"Follow me.\" She said in an concerned but angery way. Mac followed Ginger back to coop 17 and inside. They arrived at Mac's nest. Which was just under Ginger's. \"Lay down.\" She ordered. Mac climbed into bed, pulling the covers over her legs. Much comfier. Ginger began to pace in front of the bed, Mac watching her. She was wondering what Ginger was up to..until.. \"WHAT KIND OF STUNT WAS THAT!?!?!\" Ginger screamed. Mac was caught off guard and she almost fell out of bed. \"You could have been hurt! Or you could have ended up like Mary! Do you realise how lucky you are Mr Tweety caught you! With me, they know not to attack, but you! They'd would have eaten you!\" Mac blinked, Ginger was scolding her? \"Do you know how I would have felt if you had been hurt or, egg forbid, killed! And on your first mission?!\" Ginger continued. \"When that dog took off after you, I felt sick! Watching through the fence as you were run ragged! If you want to go on anymore mission you have to shape up!\" Ginger stopped, it took a second for Mac to realize she was waiting for a response. \"Ginger..ah, donno what ta say.\"Mac said. \"Ah just did what ah thought was right at the tam... why didn't cha scold me back at the ben?\" Ginger sighed. \"It would have just made you more freaked out then you already were...Look.\" Ginger looked Mac in they eyes \"I don't want anyone to get hurt with one of my plans again and neither do you, but risking your life for me won't solve anything. Its my plans, so I risk my hide. No one elses. I take the hits, the nights in the bin, everything.\" \"Well now, that seems a wee bit unfair.\" Mac began, but was silenced by Ginger's glare. \"Mac..\" Ginger held her head, she was just as tired as Mac was, but she had to get through to her. \"If anything happened on one of my plans , to you or somebody else.., I just don't think I could continued with my plans any longer.\" Ginger sat on the end of Mac's bed. \"Do you understand?\" \"Aie, ah do.\" Mac nodded. Ginger smiled and patted Mac's feet. \"Good. Now you better try and pay an egg. Mr Tweety might give you a zero.\" Ginger said. \"Ack, I thenk the egg ah had was killed bah all tee stress of lass night.\" Mac sighed, stretching back in her bed. \"At least try.\"Ginger said, then she went to leave. Mac propped herself up on one elbow. \"Oie, Ginger!\" Mac shouted, catching Gingers attention. \"Thanks for stayen with meh.\" \"Don't worry about it. \" Ginger smiled, the shut the door behind her. Mac snuggled uner the covers of her bed. She higly doubted she'd lay an egg right now, but sleep would come much easier. FIN","Summary":" Only in the dark do lights shine the brightest.

And Let Her Go I think it began with the turnip. . . . No, that doesn't quite sound right. I guess I should say I think it began to end with the turnip'. Aye, that would be more accurate, even if the juxtaposition there is enough to make you rip your own feathers out. So, anyhoo, the turnip. That little demonstration. We tried goin' UNDER the wire an' that didnae work. So, the plaun is we go OVER it. She and I had come up with a new escape plan. This plan involved a catapult. I made a smaller version of the thing for when we told our idea to the others. The scale was a little bit off and the mechanics involved made for a more powerful thrust than I'd intended, but this couldn't be helped. We had limited resources, you know. Anyway, that evening we had our meeting and showed our plan to the others. I took the cover off the little catapult and everyone looked a trifle nervous about it. Rightfully so, too. If they didn't have their doubts about the plan when she and I just started talking about it, they certainly had more than that by the end of the meeting. I wanted to show them how the catapult worked, how it would get them over that confounded fence, so I loaded the thing up with a stand-in turnip. This is us, richt? We get in like this . . . wind er up . . . An' layt er go! I said. I said that right before hitting the switch. I hit the switch. The catapult sprung. The turnip went flying. The turnip bought it as Fowler said. Aah, the foreshadowing! Let me tell you, inevitability is one factor too many of us mathematicians fail to mind in our calculations. Well, I think seeing that turnip splattered all over the wall was enough to fley [1] off any followers we might've had. Like, I said, I think it began there, with that turnip. It was the beginning of the end. Och, but that phrase is so overused . . . That night, I was right scunnert [2]. All that work putting the model together, all those hours I practically asked for Carpal Tunnel syndrome what with all the pencil-sharpening I had to do, because I can't very well draw up plans without a pencil that can write, of course . . . Well, I'd done it all for nothing. Turnip mashed, escape plan scrapped, back to the drawing board with me. She'd simply walked out of the hut, leaving the rest of us to our qualms. I watched through a crack in the door as she wandered out into the yard, perfectly steady for all the caoch [3] the others had given her for the botched escape plan. Then I watched her collapse against the fence and sob. Augh, I wish I'd'a gone out there right away and told her it would all be alright. I was going to, but . . . well, I never got the chance. Anyway, the night the turnip bought it was the night my world went a-whummel. That was the night you fell from the sky. From then on, things between me and her changed. She was quiet. Very quiet. Distant, too. She was right radge on you. You had her respect, but not her trust. You weren't good enough for her, even if you were good enough for any of us. You were right braw [4] and bonny and had stolen the hearts of a'ane [5]. Aye, I could've gone for you myself. I didn't though. I was too stuck on her. But like I said before, when you fell into our lives, things changed between her and me. Welcome back, hen. Is there a new plan? That was when she started to get really cold. Allerish [6]. Distant. She didn't want to take strolls around the yard at midnight anymore. We did that quite a lot, you know. If the moon was bright, it'd be casting our shadows because we'd be out there, walking wing-in-wing. We'd usually stroll around the perimetre of the yard. I'd have one wing in hers, while I let my other wing trail along the wire fence. Her feathers were soft and warm on my right while the fence was steely and cold on my left. I think we both liked moonlit nights. I've always been partial to starry nights myself because I liked the way I could see the stars in her eyes. Her eyes reflected Virgo on the night I told her how I felt about her. After that night, we always took walks or sat on the roof of our hut together and just . . . were . On nights when we didn't walk, sometimes she'd come down to my nest. Sometimes we'd lie beside one another and whisper back and forth. Sometimes we did more than that. The first time we tried to kiss, both of us had our eyes closed and she missed her aim and ended up chipping my glasses with her beak. This was awfully embarrassing, of course, but looking back, it was actually quite funny. Anyway, that all stopped when you came. She'd still talk to me, of course, but it was all business. There were no more strolls, no more whispers, and definitely no more kisses. I was sairly tried [7] by it all. So many times I wanted to go up to her and say Gi' us a cheeper, hen! [8] but I knew that would be asking a fat lot of her. We had a fair bit to deal with right then, what with our plan to fly over the fence and we were all a'wye an' athort [9] as it was. I didn't want to add to her problems. Are we still on? But I was undone the night I saw her with you on the rooftop. Our rooftop. I saw your shape next to hers against the moonlight - our moonlight - and, well, I'd venture to say I felt like that turnip. Seeing the pair of you like that hit me so hard. I ended up going to Fowler's quarters. After a great deal of banging on his door, he finally answered. He was right surly at having been woken up, but I just didn't care. He'd opened the door and scowled at me. It was a peculiar scowl, dark and droopy, like he was still half-asleep, which he probably was. Good grief, what could you possibly want at this hour?! he said. Cuid ye please let me in, I said more than asked. I guess he saw the tears in my eyes because he did let me in and didn't say a word when I went so far as to go ahead and sit on his bunk. At that point, I couldn't be arsed to ask first. Like I said, I just didn't care. I said, Luik, I just need some-ane te be nice to me fer aboot five minutes an' then I'll let ye alane. Fowler grunted a bit, looking at me. I think he was trying to look less annoyed and more concerned. He didn't do a very good job of that. What's the matter? he asked. So I told him. I told him how she seemed to be slipping away from me and how I'd seen her on the roof with you. If we cuid just see it fer ourseilves that micht answer some queistions. He'd known about us. About me and her, I mean. We didn't exactly make it totally bloomin'-obvious, but when you live in a confined space with a lot of others, it's no use trying to keep something to yourself, see? He hadn't been nice about it either. He'd said that what was between us was nowt but codswallop and he'd see us . I don't really know why I'd chosen to come to him with my woes. I suppose I didn't want to try taking it to someone in our hut because I'd probably end up waking everybody. I didn't exactly feel like sharing my misery with the world. Being that Fowler was the lone occupant of his quarters, he was the one to talk to, even if he himself would probably just make me feel worse. No surprise there. When I finished my sob story, he just shrugged and said Well, what do you want me to do about it? I said, I just wanted to be heard. He said Well, I heard you, alright. Does that satisfy you? He sounded like he just didn't care at all. He probably didn't. Not at that point, anyway. I said. Well what in Queen Mum's name did you wake me up for then?! he yelled. He was shaking his walking stick at me and was obviously angry. He said If that's all the good nattering has done for you, why don't you leave me in peace, go back to your nest and forget about her?! And I said I wish I cuid. That seemed to surprise him. He gave me an odd, sort of questioning look. I love er. I really dae, awat fu' well [10]. I said. I meant it, too. At least, I'm pretty sure I did. Folk say I love you all the time and it doesn't mean anything. Abusers say it. Cheaters say it. All sorts of deceivers use it to cover their arses. I'd said it to Ginger a few times and I'm fairly sure I meant it. Then again, we of science know that nothing in life is certain. I was no little bit surprised when he actually gave me a sympathetic nod. and don't really go together, do they? It was right odd. He said to me Now, buck up, old girl, what-what! He didn't say it in a drill sergeant-like Buck up, old girl, though. It was more an encouraging, supportive kind of Buck up, old girl. Wonders never cease do they? Feelings get the best of us because that is their way, he said. And we let them because it's what we want. Then, of course, he had to talk about back in his day because he's pompous like that. Back in my R.A.F days, they tried to stomp that out of us. Bad show, it was. he said. He was standing at his mirror, facing it with his wings folded behind his back. I could see his reflection. His face was hard with arrogance, but dark with a sort of sad nostalgia. Tried te stomp whot oot o' ye? I asked him. Couldn't have soldiers and officials getting all soppy could they? he said. A rhetorical question. They didn't want a covey of Nancies. They wanted troops. So that's how they ran the show. All salutes and Yes Sir!'s and left, right, left, right, left, right's. . . He kind of trailed off there and I swear I saw his tailfeathers droop a bit right then. I think he realized I'd noticed this because he immediately straightened and saluted his reflection. Did a fine job of it, too, he said. But they didn't have it all in a grip. After all, feelings, sentiments . . . he stopped for a bit there. I swear, if I'd dropped a feather I'd've heard it meet the ground, things had gone so silent. . . . Love, he finally continued. I must say, it was right odd hearing him say that word. Well, they're bloody hard to get rid of! he said, stomping. It was almost like he was angry at himself. Maybe he was. He still refused to face me. Trying to smash the feelings out of a lad is like trying to smash a bluebottle with bare feet, what! Now this was getting interesting. I asked 'Ow d'ye know aboot all that? Then, he turned really slowly and gave me this long, stern kind of look. He opened the drawer of his bureau and took out a bit of paper. It looked like he'd torn it out of the Post, or something, and it was yellowed, creased and old-looking. He passed this to me and said Don't let it cross your mind that you're the only one who's been in that boat. It was a black and white photograph printed onto a news page. The original picture had obviously been of a squadron of roosters, but most of it had been torn away. Only two roosters were visible, standing beside one another in the remains of the photograph. One of them was very handsome and smiling brightly. He looked quite a bit like you, come to think of it. The other was most definitely a much younger Fowler. I couldn't help but smile. He quickly took the photograph back and turned his back to me again, no little bit embarrassed. When daes it go away? I asked. He sighed then. It never goes away, dear girl. Why do you think I've kept this clipping all these years? he said. Again with the rhetoric. he added, It will stop hurting. I asked. He put the photograph back and closed the bureau drawer. He said When you let her go. I don't know how to describe the way I felt just then. It was a heavy sort of relief, I think. Mostly heavy. It was right adwang [11] on my heart. I got up to leave. I said, halfway out the door, 'Oo was Fowler sort of twitched at that. He pulled the covers down to the foot of his bed, even though it was obvious that he didn't plan on having a kip any time soon. Finally he said Fletcher. Lieutenant A. L. Fletcher. In the service for a year and a half, deserted under fire. Fowler growled a bit and added Ruddy Welsh pansy. Out of respect, I waited until I was well out of earshot to bust up laughing. It was nice to be able to laugh that night, even if laughed so hard I ended up crying. Anyway, it took me a while, but I came to realize that what he'd said was perfectly true. I had to let her go. So I did just that. I told myself over and over again that she would be happy with you -as she seems to be- and I would be happy if she was happy. And you know what? I-I believe ye, but . . . I soon started to actually to believe it. I must say, for a while there, I couldn't help thinking that I was just joshing myself. I distracted myself with work. We had a job to do and everyone was banking on me for calculations, blueprints, engineering, the lot. Still, I couldn't ignore that feeling I had deep down, that I couldn't go on without her, even if she had found happiness. Looking back, that was very soppy of me, wasn't it? Well, either way, it went on like that for while. Then, all of sudden, I got to a turning point. The wings of our aircraft had just unfolded. All of the pieces were falling into place. The great heap was ready for takeoff and all my hard work was about to amount to something for aince [12]. Anyway, I was standing there, ticking things off in my notebook, and up she comes, braw and bright like the sun. She patted me on the shoulder and looked at me. When she looked at me, she was beaming. That night the stars were shining. I could see them in her eyes. There were other things there too. Bright things. The moon overhead, the lights from our runway, and me. I was still there. I would always be in her eyes with the stars even if I wasn't in her heart. She smiled and I smiled back. I even laughed a bit, in spite of myself. It was right then that I found I was able to let go. I wasn't at all bothered when she climbed into the plane with you. Not even when she kissed you. You've saved her life plenty of times. You came back to her even though it meant risking your neck. You've made her happy. We're givin' her all she's goht! That's all I could ever ask of you. It took a spot of time and a great lot of patience, but now she's happy and I am too. We're living in a paradise, away from chopping blocks and fences and pie machines. She's going along with you and she's been smiling more brightly than should be legal. I'll wager you two are planning on putting forth a few bairns, aren't you? If you are, I say go for it. She would make an excellent mother, I'm sure. Maybe I'll meet a rooster lad of my own and we'll have kids ourselves someday. For now, I'm more than fine with being a professor. I've always wanted to teach. Actually, just the other day, I was giving a physics lesson and it made me think about these things, everything that's happened up till now, I mean. That little catapult I'd made proved useful after all. I was using it to demonstrate the dynamics of thrust and momentum. Safety at all times is imperative . . . One of my students was the test subject. After the turnip episode, I had enough wits about me to give the poor wee babe a helmet. So I loaded him up and things went basically the same way they had the first time . . . . . . wind er up . . . . . . Minus the ker-SPLAT!', of course. Anyway, I've been having a think ever since. About you, about life, about love, and of course, about her. Well, let me just tell you right now, you'd better take good, fine care of that hen, or I'll have your giblets for gewgaws! Oh, and there're a few things you should know. First of all, she doesn't have a very big appetite, so don't worry if you think she's not eating enough. She just eats . . . well, like a bird. Also, she likes relaxing little games like cricket and hopscotch. Especially on summer afternoons. And you really should know that she likes to take charge. If you're thinking of pulling that I wear the tailfeathers around here routine with her, I'd forget it if I were you because she just won't have it. And never touch that hat of hers. I tried it once and she nearly took my wing off. I must say, she's downright snarky about that thing! And I think you know by now that she really hates pet-names, so I won't say nowt about that. Anyway, above all else, make her happy. Always. If you can do that, I wouldn't have it any other way. . . . an' layt er go! ~ end So, I wrote the first Chicken Run slash to appear on Fanfiction.net, did I? Hoo boy.

A delightful read it is, so do check that out ^_^ Other comments/schtuff: This is from Mac's POV and she's addressing Rocky. Let's assume that at this point, Rocky is able to understand her at least somewhat ^_^; I added bits of her dialogue from the film in italics here and there just because I thought them fitting. They don't really mean anything, so feel free to pay them no mind ^_- NOTE: All Scottish words/phrases followed by a number in brackets are translated at the bottom of the page. And Let Her Go I think it began with the turnip. . . . No, that doesn't quite sound right. I guess I should say I think it began to end with the turnip'. Aye, that would be more accurate, even if the juxtaposition there is enough to make you rip your own feathers out. So, anyhoo, the turnip. That little demonstration. We tried goin' UNDER the wire an' that didnae work. So, the plaun is we go OVER it. She and I had come up with a new escape plan. This plan involved a catapult. I made a smaller version of the thing for when we told our idea to the others. The scale was a little bit off and the mechanics involved made for a more powerful thrust than I'd intended, but this couldn't be helped. We had limited resources, you know. Anyway, that evening we had our meeting and showed our plan to the others. I took the cover off the little catapult and everyone looked a trifle nervous about it. Rightfully so, too. If they didn't have their doubts about the plan when she and I just started talking about it, they certainly had more than that by the end of the meeting. I wanted to show them how the catapult worked, how it would get them over that confounded fence, so I loaded the thing up with a stand-in turnip. This is us, richt? We get in like this . . . wind er up . . . An' layt er go! I said. I said that right before hitting the switch. I hit the switch. The catapult sprung. The turnip went flying. The turnip bought it as Fowler said. Aah, the foreshadowing! Let me tell you, inevitability is one factor too many of us mathematicians fail to mind in our calculations. Well, I think seeing that turnip splattered all over the wall was enough to fley [1] off any followers we might've had. Like, I said, I think it began there, with that turnip. It was the beginning of the end. Och, but that phrase is so overused . . . That night, I was right scunnert [2]. All that work putting the model together, all those hours I practically asked for Carpal Tunnel syndrome what with all the pencil-sharpening I had to do, because I can't very well draw up plans without a pencil that can write, of course . . . Well, I'd done it all for nothing. Turnip mashed, escape plan scrapped, back to the drawing board with me. She'd simply walked out of the hut, leaving the rest of us to our qualms. I watched through a crack in the door as she wandered out into the yard, perfectly steady for all the caoch [3] the others had given her for the botched escape plan. Then I watched her collapse against the fence and sob. Augh, I wish I'd'a gone out there right away and told her it would all be alright. I was going to, but . . . well, I never got the chance. Anyway, the night the turnip bought it was the night my world went a-whummel. That was the night you fell from the sky. From then on, things between me and her changed. She was quiet. Very quiet. Distant, too. She was right radge on you. You had her respect, but not her trust. You weren't good enough for her, even if you were good enough for any of us. You were right braw [4] and bonny and had stolen the hearts of a'ane [5]. Aye, I could've gone for you myself. I didn't though. I was too stuck on her. But like I said before, when you fell into our lives, things changed between her and me. Welcome back, hen. Is there a new plan? That was when she started to get really cold. Allerish [6]. Distant. She didn't want to take strolls around the yard at midnight anymore. We did that quite a lot, you know. If the moon was bright, it'd be casting our shadows because we'd be out there, walking wing-in-wing. We'd usually stroll around the perimetre of the yard. I'd have one wing in hers, while I let my other wing trail along the wire fence. Her feathers were soft and warm on my right while the fence was steely and cold on my left. I think we both liked moonlit nights. I've always been partial to starry nights myself because I liked the way I could see the stars in her eyes. Her eyes reflected Virgo on the night I told her how I felt about her. After that night, we always took walks or sat on the roof of our hut together and just . . . were . On nights when we didn't walk, sometimes she'd come down to my nest. Sometimes we'd lie beside one another and whisper back and forth. Sometimes we did more than that. The first time we tried to kiss, both of us had our eyes closed and she missed her aim and ended up chipping my glasses with her beak. This was awfully embarrassing, of course, but looking back, it was actually quite funny. Anyway, that all stopped when you came. She'd still talk to me, of course, but it was all business. There were no more strolls, no more whispers, and definitely no more kisses. I was sairly tried [7] by it all. So many times I wanted to go up to her and say Gi' us a cheeper, hen! [8] but I knew that would be asking a fat lot of her. We had a fair bit to deal with right then, what with our plan to fly over the fence and we were all a'wye an' athort [9] as it was. I didn't want to add to her problems. Are we still on? But I was undone the night I saw her with you on the rooftop. Our rooftop. I saw your shape next to hers against the moonlight - our moonlight - and, well, I'd venture to say I felt like that turnip. Seeing the pair of you like that hit me so hard. I ended up going to Fowler's quarters. After a great deal of banging on his door, he finally answered. He was right surly at having been woken up, but I just didn't care. He'd opened the door and scowled at me. It was a peculiar scowl, dark and droopy, like he was still half-asleep, which he probably was. Good grief, what could you possibly want at this hour?! he said. Cuid ye please let me in, I said more than asked. I guess he saw the tears in my eyes because he did let me in and didn't say a word when I went so far as to go ahead and sit on his bunk. At that point, I couldn't be arsed to ask first. Like I said, I just didn't care. I said, Luik, I just need some-ane te be nice to me fer aboot five minutes an' then I'll let ye alane. Fowler grunted a bit, looking at me. I think he was trying to look less annoyed and more concerned. He didn't do a very good job of that. What's the matter? he asked. So I told him. I told him how she seemed to be slipping away from me and how I'd seen her on the roof with you. If we cuid just see it fer ourseilves that micht answer some queistions. He'd known about us. About me and her, I mean. We didn't exactly make it totally bloomin'-obvious, but when you live in a confined space with a lot of others, it's no use trying to keep something to yourself, see? He hadn't been nice about it either. He'd said that what was between us was nowt but codswallop and he'd see us . I don't really know why I'd chosen to come to him with my woes. I suppose I didn't want to try taking it to someone in our hut because I'd probably end up waking everybody. I didn't exactly feel like sharing my misery with the world. Being that Fowler was the lone occupant of his quarters, he was the one to talk to, even if he himself would probably just make me feel worse. No surprise there. When I finished my sob story, he just shrugged and said Well, what do you want me to do about it? I said, I just wanted to be heard. He said Well, I heard you, alright. Does that satisfy you? He sounded like he just didn't care at all. He probably didn't. Not at that point, anyway. I said. Well what in Queen Mum's name did you wake me up for then?! he yelled. He was shaking his walking stick at me and was obviously angry. He said If that's all the good nattering has done for you, why don't you leave me in peace, go back to your nest and forget about her?! And I said I wish I cuid. That seemed to surprise him. He gave me an odd, sort of questioning look. I love er. I really dae, awat fu' well [10]. I said. I meant it, too. At least, I'm pretty sure I did. Folk say I love you all the time and it doesn't mean anything. Abusers say it. Cheaters say it. All sorts of deceivers use it to cover their arses. I'd said it to Ginger a few times and I'm fairly sure I meant it. Then again, we of science know that nothing in life is certain. I was no little bit surprised when he actually gave me a sympathetic nod. and don't really go together, do they? It was right odd. He said to me Now, buck up, old girl, what-what! He didn't say it in a drill sergeant-like Buck up, old girl, though. It was more an encouraging, supportive kind of Buck up, old girl. Wonders never cease do they? Feelings get the best of us because that is their way, he said. And we let them because it's what we want. Then, of course, he had to talk about back in his day because he's pompous like that. Back in my R.A.F days, they tried to stomp that out of us. Bad show, it was. he said. He was standing at his mirror, facing it with his wings folded behind his back. I could see his reflection. His face was hard with arrogance, but dark with a sort of sad nostalgia. Tried te stomp whot oot o' ye? I asked him. Couldn't have soldiers and officials getting all soppy could they? he said. A rhetorical question. They didn't want a covey of Nancies. They wanted troops. So that's how they ran the show. All salutes and Yes Sir!'s and left, right, left, right, left, right's. . . He kind of trailed off there and I swear I saw his tailfeathers droop a bit right then. I think he realized I'd noticed this because he immediately straightened and saluted his reflection. Did a fine job of it, too, he said. But they didn't have it all in a grip. After all, feelings, sentiments . . . he stopped for a bit there. I swear, if I'd dropped a feather I'd've heard it meet the ground, things had gone so silent. . . . Love, he finally continued. I must say, it was right odd hearing him say that word. Well, they're bloody hard to get rid of! he said, stomping. It was almost like he was angry at himself. Maybe he was. He still refused to face me. Trying to smash the feelings out of a lad is like trying to smash a bluebottle with bare feet, what! Now this was getting interesting. I asked 'Ow d'ye know aboot all that? Then, he turned really slowly and gave me this long, stern kind of look. He opened the drawer of his bureau and took out a bit of paper. It looked like he'd torn it out of the Post, or something, and it was yellowed, creased and old-looking. He passed this to me and said Don't let it cross your mind that you're the only one who's been in that boat. It was a black and white photograph printed onto a news page. The original picture had obviously been of a squadron of roosters, but most of it had been torn away. Only two roosters were visible, standing beside one another in the remains of the photograph. One of them was very handsome and smiling brightly. He looked quite a bit like you, come to think of it. The other was most definitely a much younger Fowler. I couldn't help but smile. He quickly took the photograph back and turned his back to me again, no little bit embarrassed. When daes it go away? I asked. He sighed then. It never goes away, dear girl. Why do you think I've kept this clipping all these years? he said. Again with the rhetoric. he added, It will stop hurting. I asked. He put the photograph back and closed the bureau drawer. He said When you let her go. I don't know how to describe the way I felt just then. It was a heavy sort of relief, I think. Mostly heavy. It was right adwang [11] on my heart. I got up to leave. I said, halfway out the door, 'Oo was Fowler sort of twitched at that. He pulled the covers down to the foot of his bed, even though it was obvious that he didn't plan on having a kip any time soon. Finally he said Fletcher. Lieutenant A. L. Fletcher. In the service for a year and a half, deserted under fire. Fowler growled a bit and added Ruddy Welsh pansy. Out of respect, I waited until I was well out of earshot to bust up laughing. It was nice to be able to laugh that night, even if laughed so hard I ended up crying. Anyway, it took me a while, but I came to realize that what he'd said was perfectly true. I had to let her go. So I did just that. I told myself over and over again that she would be happy with you -as she seems to be- and I would be happy if she was happy. And you know what? I-I believe ye, but . . . I soon started to actually to believe it. I must say, for a while there, I couldn't help thinking that I was just joshing myself. I distracted myself with work. We had a job to do and everyone was banking on me for calculations, blueprints, engineering, the lot. Still, I couldn't ignore that feeling I had deep down, that I couldn't go on without her, even if she had found happiness. Looking back, that was very soppy of me, wasn't it?

Take a stretch out side of my comfort zone? I'm quite satisfied with how this came out. It's based off a handful of fan-theories and artwork from the internet; and the conversations of one truly creative individual. (Yes, if you're reading this you know who you are! *wink*) After looking at various artwork of the characters being drawn sometimes all as chickens, and other times all as people, I started wondering: why not create some overlapping world? Clearly the chicken and human characters worked on different wavelengths. Communication between them was impossible in the movie. But what if, just maybe, there was an overlapping? People say our dreams are sometimes where we meet others: that on occasion they're more than just the pictures generated by our brains as we sort out the days' events. And what if, maybe, just maybe, in this place the humans and chickens did meet as equals? It takes place directly after the ending of the movie \"Chicken Run,\" and is written with a narrative that I hope sounds more like the lead character, and less like me. Standard disclaimer : I do not own Chicken Run, or any of the characters mentioned in this. They're all property of their respective creating entities. This is a non-profit piece of fan fiction. The old stone-barn was destroyed, Melisha was dead. That was it. For the first time ever in my life, I found myself truly alone. Even after my parents had died, my brother had still been there with me. When he left, I had already married Melisha. It felt so strange to return to my house after the authorities and mortician had come. Walking past the empty coops, climbing up the tread worn front steps, crossing the threshold. Everything was quiet, still. Even the dogs had run off in the confusion. Now, bearing in mind and all that things with Melisha had been on the sour for a long time, I still had become accustomed to her presence at the farm house. She was my wife, after all. I'd never truly come around to expecting I'd outlive her. Seemed like she'd be one of these women who kept her vitality for the ages. I stared at our wedding photo on the wall. It hung next to my brother's portrait. So strange, it all seemed a lifetime ago. Those faces, mine, hers, his in his uniform. Frozen smiles that in the end would outlast us all. My brother and I had grown up here, you see. As close as any two people ever could've been. And when the war came, well, he went with it. I was too young to join with him. Then, when I was older that old injury to my leg, that break that never did quite heal the way it should've cost me my entrance. What can I say about the war? Nothing I suppose that hasn't been said by blokes more well-spoken than I. My brother? He was shot down. Not even enough left for a funeral, they told me as they presented me with his medals, a burned photograph of us as boys (the one he always kept in his breast pocket), and their condolences. And the chicken. Somehow, my brother's pet chicken had survived. Of course he'd have a chicken. It confounded his fellows, but it brought a smile to my tear-stained face. Jack and his love of all things, great and small. He should've stayed here on the farm. Or maybe, taken those skills of his and become a medic on the field. But no, he had to be the hero. Where he'd gotten that bird was anyone's guess. A grey rooster with piercing eyes and a rather cantankerous attitude. The thing even wore a little scarf with an Airman's medal pinned to it. As the men departed, I turned to bring the bird inside. It looked battle-weary itself, some of his tail feathers still burned off. They told me his name was Fowler. My wife, may I tell the truth and shame the devil, did not share my joy at having one last piece of my brother's life to cherish. In no short order, she quickly banished the bird from the house to the coops with the rest. I suppose that brings me about full circle. This chicken, in fact all of them, proved more clever than I could've imagined. I knew they were up to something, organizing as it were. Of course Melisha didn't believe that. She questioned my soundness for thinking such outlandish ideas. Come to be honest, I almost started believing her over my own eyes and ears. That red bird though, she was the ringleader. Organize they did, and not just escape but flew, in some cockamamie contraption, piloted by none other than that grey rooster himself. I don't know what I felt then, watching them leave. I went to tell my wife, but the explosion in the barn caught her off guard. And that's the last I have heart to speak of there. It's grown late, the oil in the lamp is running low. I can only hope that sleep takes me soon. This house is too big, too empty to live in alone. You can't ever tell where reality ends and dreams begin. Things seem to merge. Maybe the reflection in the mirror's just a wee bit off center, or water seemed to be flowing uphill. It's not right, but it's not wrong enough to set the dreamer's mind awake in strangeness. I know I'm dreaming now. I'm walking the rows between the hen houses, but the fences are gone and the houses are the size of my own. It's not like I'm shrunk exactly, because the grass is the same as it always were. Chicken coops for people, or something. And as I walk past them, I peer into the doors. They look like little houses inside. Tables, chairs, pictures on the wall. I see this woman bending over tending to a pack of children that sit around a table. How can I describe this in ways that make sense? It's like seeing two things, but it's one thing. Blended together. Or I'm seeing both at the same time. That woman, she's also a broody hen. Her children are her wee chicks. I can see her feathers and wings, at the same time her apron and hair in a bonnet. Same with the little ones. They're wearing clothes, but they're also not more than balls of yellow fluff. I guess the best way to describe it is like looking through the triple-paned glass in the ice house at the farm. When I'm in, loading blocks into the sawdust and peer through those windows I see outside... but I also see my reflection and the room behind me mirrored in the glass. Depending on how I focus my eyes, I can see the barnyard, or the icehouse interior. Or, if I let my vision blur I rather see both in one, a room outside... a yard in the icehouse. Well, I hope that makes sense. Because that's the truth of the matter. Depending on how I looked at the folks here, I saw either chickens or people, or the vision of both in one. They didn't seem to take much notice of me as they went about their lives. Another woman passed by carrying a tray of bread. She gave me a nod, and I made to tip my hat to her with my hand... my wing! It was both in one, and I came up short and stared at my hand, flexing my fingers, watching the feathers mimic the movements. The hen paused, tilted her head. \"You all right there?\" She asked in a heavy Scottish accent. \"I'm fine, yes.\" \"Aye, well you best be getting on then, not standing here lost in the middle of the street, yes?\" she said with a friendly smile, giving me a pat on the back. \"Right then,\" I agreed, confused. My feet moved of their own accord, and like the rest of me, of us, they were both my feet and not in one. Each house had its own distinct style of decoration, representing the personalities of the inhabitants thereof. I passed one hut that had an American flag hanging on the wall inside. A large, red rooster was sitting with his feet up on a wood bin, plunking away at a guitar. He didn't wasn't the most skilled. I walked up the ramp to his house and peered in. Definitely an American theme. It was as if that rooster I'd had imported from the states had decorated the place. I continued my walk through this idyllic little village, then something caught my eye. One of the huts was set back from the others a bit, a dusty path leading up to the front door through the lawn. That wasn't what I saw though. It was the flag flying from a pole beside the front gate. I could've recognized that flag from anywhere. It was the same they gave me when they came to tell me Jack died. I walked up to the front path, looked up at that flag and felt myself completely lost in emotion, not the least of which, hope. \"Jack?\" I called out, my pace quickening as I ran towards the hut. \"JACK!\" A man stepped out of the house, pushing aside the curtain that served as a front door. He was tall and lean, wearing the uniform of a Wing Commander, the same blue grey that Jack used to wear, but it wasn't my brother. This fellow was far older, his face lined and serious, he had a grey beard, small and neatly trimmed. His hair was whisky silver, pulled back into a ponytail that fell down past his shoulders. He tightened the white scarf around his neck and glared at me, blue eyes narrowing behind under-rimmed glasses. He leaned on a cane, though it appeared more for style then actual support. \"What are you yelling about, lad?\" he barked, voice sharp. \"We've got ourselves quiet folk around here, don't need you all about disturbing the peace.\" \"I'm sorry, Sir,\" I replied, kicking the dirt with a clawed foot. Chicken foot. Boot, but also chicken foot. I didn't waste time thinking about that. \"I thought maybe you were someone else.\" The man strode up to me, back ramrod straight. \"Jack, eh?\" He peered at me through the thick lenses of his glasses. He was half a head taller than me, and his rigid posture only added to the sense of height. I tell you, he looked so familiar, like I should know him from somewhere. The grey feathers, the worn look... Then it hit me! Hit us I should say. \"You're -that farmer\" \"-that grey rooster!\" we blurted out in unison. \"Tweedy,\" the rooster hissed, narrowing his eyes and removing his glasses. He folded them and slipped them into his breast pocket. \"I've got more than half a mind to run you off my land forthright,\" he snapped, jabbing a finger into the center of my feathered chest. \"Fowler,\" I started, then realized I had no idea what to say next. Because it was a dream, after all. And so did it matter? But it felt real, and I wasn't waking up despite the bizarreness of it all. So I pushed on. \"You flew with my brother Jack! And you survived the crash.\" My hands trembled, I wanted to reach out, embrace the thin officer, but his bearing alone prevented it. \"I never thought I'd see you again.\" His lip curled. \"You planned to turn us into pies.\" \"I had nothing to do with that!\" He jabbed at my foot with a cane. \"Hog feathers!\" the old Royal Air Force officer coughed. \"Your farm, your land, your wife. Apathy in the face of adversity is the same as approval. You didn't stop it, as such, you condone it! If you don't seek to stop the enemy, you are the enemy. I am done with you. You're not welcome in our village. Begone with you!\" Fowler swung his cane, connected hard across my shin. I yelped, and clutched my leg, caught off balance, and fell into the dust of his front path. I tried to right myself, but wing and arm and boots and claws... it was all confusing and too much. I rolled onto my stomach, the most I could do, and buried my head in my arms. I tasted the gravely earth on my lips. It tasted like so many times the children in the Dales had knocked me down when I was a small boy: my dismay was the aim of their sport. I clenched my teeth, felt the crunch of grit between them. This was when Jack would come in, knocking them aside, helping me up. He'd wipe the dirt from my face, muttering his soft reassurances that everything would be all right. Not this time. Jack was dead. Even in this dream he wasn't coming back. Tears, hot and unwanted leaked from my eyes, hastily sucked into the dry earth. I clenched my fingers, I was nothing. The fat fool, the imbecile that Melisha had also said I was. Nothing. A waste. I punched the dirt, sending up clouds of dust from my clenched fists. I kicked. I ground my face against the path. A tantrum the likes of a small child, knocked down one too many times to risk standing up again. I'd probably be there still if a pair of shoes hadn't come into the very edge of my vision. I tilted my head, raising my cheek from the earth and looked at the mirror-shined finish of Fowler's military issue boots. He prodded me with the toe of one, a foot that was both a chicken's leg and an officer's dress uniform. \"Come off it. You're embarrassing us both,\" he commanded. I rolled on my side, but made no motion to get up. After a minute of quiet observation, Fowler reached down and extended a hand. I took it, marveling at the wiry strength of the old veteran as he hauled my embarrassingly plump self to my feet. \"What in the name of God and Country are you doing?\" Fowler demanded. I started blubbering right then and there, and to be honest I am just as glad I can't remember all I said. I should've stopped talking, but it was as if the words had been bottled up for too long, and someone had removed the stopper. They fell out of my mouth, pooling around us both, memories, stories, the entire litany of my truth. And Fowler? God bless him, he listened! He listened and he stayed until I had no tears left to shed. Then, only after I was completely spent did he talk again. \"You know, I do remember,\" he began as he leaned on his cane. \"You came down to the coops, you painted the Royal Air Force roundels in my coop when your wife banished me from the house. You tried, at least for a time. We could range free around the farmyard, return to our coops at night. There were no fences, no dogs. Life was good for us. What changed?\" \"I was weak.\" \"You were weak,\" Fowler repeated, agreeing. His words stung, but no more than any other truth. I looked at the dirt on my knees, and hung my head. \"Jack wasn't weak,\" I muttered. Fowler tilted his head, shifted his weight. \"Jack had his moments,\" the rooster replied. \"There were things you didn't see that I did. I suppose I shouldn't judge you too harshly. But still...\" his voice trailed off. \"What's going to become of me?\" I asked him. \"What do you mean?\" Fowler asked. \"The Tweedys have been egg farmers for generations. With no chickens, no eggs. No eggs, no money. I'll be starving and frozen come winter, if I make it that long. Farming's the only thing I know!\" Fowler stroked his beard thoughtfully. \"I might be willing to make you a deal.\" \"Anything!\" \"Let me talk with the rest of the flock,\" Fowler replied. \"But, in the meantime, you're going to have to do something for us. Tear down the fences, get rid of the dogs. Let us be able to come and go as we please, feel the grass beneath our feet. Though they might not know anything but the camps, I remember an earlier time. I make no promises, but I will see.\" It took me a moment to figure out what he was talking about. He was asking me to put everything back, to the way it used to be, before Melisha converted our farm into a prison. I was reaching out to shake Fowler's hand- -And I was awake. I was sitting up in bed, hand outstretched to no one but the still and heavy darkness. Of course, just a dream. Nothing more. Still, it seemed more than just some imaging. That strange sort of feeling in my guts that I couldn't explain then or now. So, that morning I was up before dawn ripping out the barbed wire fences, laying fresh straw in the coops, cleaning from sunrise to sun set. No one helped, no one stopped by to ask what I was doing. The carts on the road passed by without so much as a nod of sympathy to my loss. Poor old Tweedy , I imagined them thinking. He's gone round the bend for sure . And, telling the truth I wondered if they probably weren't right. Still I worked, pulling stakes, tossing the coiled wire in bails by the ruins of the old barn. That night, I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the downfeather pillow. If I dreamed, to be sure I didn't remember aside from one image that stood out in my mind. \"I did it,\" I told the old bird. \"I made it a home again. You can come back now.\" Whatever Fowler said, lord knows I'm a simple man. I wish I could recall. But I will tell you one thing. When I woke up the next morning it wasn't from the sunlight or hunger. No. It was a sound I hadn't heard in too long: to crowing of a rooster atop the garden shed. Fowler and his flock had come home!","LastChapter":"Author's Note: This is a deviation from my typical genres, but why not play around a bit? Take a stretch out side of my comfort zone? I'm quite satisfied with how this came out. It's based off a handful of fan-theories and artwork from the internet; and the conversations of one truly creative individual. (Yes, if you're reading this you know who you are! *wink*) After looking at various artwork of the characters being drawn sometimes all as chickens, and other times all as people, I started wondering: why not create some overlapping world? Clearly the chicken and human characters worked on different wavelengths. Communication between them was impossible in the movie. But what if, just maybe, there was an overlapping? People say our dreams are sometimes where we meet others: that on occasion they're more than just the pictures generated by our brains as we sort out the days' events. And what if, maybe, just maybe, in this place the humans and chickens did meet as equals? It takes place directly after the ending of the movie \"Chicken Run,\" and is written with a narrative that I hope sounds more like the lead character, and less like me. Standard disclaimer : I do not own Chicken Run, or any of the characters mentioned in this. They're all property of their respective creating entities. This is a non-profit piece of fan fiction. The old stone-barn was destroyed, Melisha was dead. That was it. For the first time ever in my life, I found myself truly alone. Even after my parents had died, my brother had still been there with me. When he left, I had already married Melisha. It felt so strange to return to my house after the authorities and mortician had come. Walking past the empty coops, climbing up the tread worn front steps, crossing the threshold. Everything was quiet, still. Even the dogs had run off in the confusion. Now, bearing in mind and all that things with Melisha had been on the sour for a long time, I still had become accustomed to her presence at the farm house. She was my wife, after all. I'd never truly come around to expecting I'd outlive her. Seemed like she'd be one of these women who kept her vitality for the ages. I stared at our wedding photo on the wall. It hung next to my brother's portrait. So strange, it all seemed a lifetime ago. Those faces, mine, hers, his in his uniform. Frozen smiles that in the end would outlast us all. My brother and I had grown up here, you see. As close as any two people ever could've been. And when the war came, well, he went with it. I was too young to join with him. Then, when I was older that old injury to my leg, that break that never did quite heal the way it should've cost me my entrance. What can I say about the war? Nothing I suppose that hasn't been said by blokes more well-spoken than I. My brother? He was shot down. Not even enough left for a funeral, they told me as they presented me with his medals, a burned photograph of us as boys (the one he always kept in his breast pocket), and their condolences. And the chicken. Somehow, my brother's pet chicken had survived. Of course he'd have a chicken. It confounded his fellows, but it brought a smile to my tear-stained face. Jack and his love of all things, great and small. He should've stayed here on the farm. Or maybe, taken those skills of his and become a medic on the field. But no, he had to be the hero. Where he'd gotten that bird was anyone's guess. A grey rooster with piercing eyes and a rather cantankerous attitude. The thing even wore a little scarf with an Airman's medal pinned to it. As the men departed, I turned to bring the bird inside. It looked battle-weary itself, some of his tail feathers still burned off. They told me his name was Fowler. My wife, may I tell the truth and shame the devil, did not share my joy at having one last piece of my brother's life to cherish. In no short order, she quickly banished the bird from the house to the coops with the rest. I suppose that brings me about full circle. This chicken, in fact all of them, proved more clever than I could've imagined. I knew they were up to something, organizing as it were. Of course Melisha didn't believe that. She questioned my soundness for thinking such outlandish ideas. Come to be honest, I almost started believing her over my own eyes and ears. That red bird though, she was the ringleader. Organize they did, and not just escape but flew, in some cockamamie contraption, piloted by none other than that grey rooster himself. I don't know what I felt then, watching them leave. I went to tell my wife, but the explosion in the barn caught her off guard. And that's the last I have heart to speak of there. It's grown late, the oil in the lamp is running low. I can only hope that sleep takes me soon. This house is too big, too empty to live in alone. You can't ever tell where reality ends and dreams begin. Things seem to merge. Maybe the reflection in the mirror's just a wee bit off center, or water seemed to be flowing uphill. It's not right, but it's not wrong enough to set the dreamer's mind awake in strangeness. I know I'm dreaming now. I'm walking the rows between the hen houses, but the fences are gone and the houses are the size of my own. It's not like I'm shrunk exactly, because the grass is the same as it always were. Chicken coops for people, or something. And as I walk past them, I peer into the doors. They look like little houses inside. Tables, chairs, pictures on the wall. I see this woman bending over tending to a pack of children that sit around a table. How can I describe this in ways that make sense? It's like seeing two things, but it's one thing. Blended together. Or I'm seeing both at the same time. That woman, she's also a broody hen. Her children are her wee chicks. I can see her feathers and wings, at the same time her apron and hair in a bonnet. Same with the little ones. They're wearing clothes, but they're also not more than balls of yellow fluff. I guess the best way to describe it is like looking through the triple-paned glass in the ice house at the farm. When I'm in, loading blocks into the sawdust and peer through those windows I see outside... but I also see my reflection and the room behind me mirrored in the glass. Depending on how I focus my eyes, I can see the barnyard, or the icehouse interior. Or, if I let my vision blur I rather see both in one, a room outside... a yard in the icehouse. Well, I hope that makes sense. Because that's the truth of the matter. Depending on how I looked at the folks here, I saw either chickens or people, or the vision of both in one. They didn't seem to take much notice of me as they went about their lives. Another woman passed by carrying a tray of bread. She gave me a nod, and I made to tip my hat to her with my hand... my wing! It was both in one, and I came up short and stared at my hand, flexing my fingers, watching the feathers mimic the movements. The hen paused, tilted her head. \"You all right there?\" She asked in a heavy Scottish accent. \"I'm fine, yes.\" \"Aye, well you best be getting on then, not standing here lost in the middle of the street, yes?\" she said with a friendly smile, giving me a pat on the back. \"Right then,\" I agreed, confused. My feet moved of their own accord, and like the rest of me, of us, they were both my feet and not in one. Each house had its own distinct style of decoration, representing the personalities of the inhabitants thereof. I passed one hut that had an American flag hanging on the wall inside. A large, red rooster was sitting with his feet up on a wood bin, plunking away at a guitar. He didn't wasn't the most skilled. I walked up the ramp to his house and peered in. Definitely an American theme. It was as if that rooster I'd had imported from the states had decorated the place. I continued my walk through this idyllic little village, then something caught my eye. One of the huts was set back from the others a bit, a dusty path leading up to the front door through the lawn.

The sick part was much stronger when she first came. We both offered tonleave the other alone, and then we both finally decided that both of usnwanted to say something. Ever since before she was taken by the farmer andnhis wife, I had wanted to tell her the truth - to just let it out, becausenit hurt so much now to keep it inside. She deserved to know the truth, Inthought. It was either now or later. After she had thanked me - which I still don't think I deserve - she askednme what I wanted to say.

She took this much more good-humoredly than I had previously expected. \"Younmean grass isn't all that it's cracked up to be,\" she half-laughed. \"Grass!\" I repeated, as though I had just received a revelation. \"Exactly,ngrass - it's always greener on the other side. And then, you get there tonthe other side, and it's brown and prickly. . .\" I had double-checked my wings and feathers to see if the answer had arrivednto them while I wasn't looking. It hadn't. Nervously expectant, I asked, \"See what I'm trying to say?\" Her smile - hernbeautiful smile, which captivated me since the moment I got here - fadednslowly as she shook her head. My beak paralyzed by my own fear, as well asnthe disappearance of that smile. \"Uh, what I'm trying to say is.\" I hadnsighed, now feeling that there was no way I'd ever be able to work up thencourage to tell the truth; \"you're welcome.\" Then, the worst part came - \"I think tonight that hill seems closer thannit's ever been.\" Giving me another one of those painful I-would-trust-you-ninto-a-fox's-den smiles, she had risen from her seat and prepared to walknoff the roof. It was then that I began to loath myself. \"Good night, Rocky,\" she said softly, and made her way down. That was also when the sick-happy-feeling came. \"Good night. . .\" I said, and my heart filled with guilt, as well asnadmiration for the girl, I ended, \"Ginger.\" At least I had done one thing tonight to redeem myself. Ginger - yes, Inknow her real name - had always hated it when I called her nicknames -n\"Baby Doll,\" \"Angel Face,\" and, my personal favorite, \"Doll Face.\" Shenprobably thought that they were degrading, which, I guess, was actuallynsort of close to the truth. Back during my circus names, I always called my lady-interests nicknames;nGinger was actually the first to ever mind. The hens I used to know likednbeing called \"Chick,\" \"Blue Eyes,\" and stuff like that. They liked thenattention, and I liked complimenting their good looks. Then, when I metnGinger, I began doing the same thing, but I also surprised in myself inncoming up with completely brand-new names. I would like to think that - fornher, at least - they were more terms of *endearment,* but she got offendednnevertheless. And she deserved more than that, I decided earlier tonight. She wasn't annempty, pretty hen; oh, she was pretty all right, but she was just as good-nlooking on the inside as the out. As I sat on Pop's bunk that he had given to me for the night for my act ofn\"heroism,\" I sunk deeper into despair. Glancing briefly over my shoulder, Ingot up and looked into the underside of the metal bucket. I saw a handsomenface, but what else was really there? . . . 'A liar,' I thought bitterly to myself. 'All I see is a no-good liar.' Shendeserved more than that too. Turning away from my awful reflection, I looked around the room with anfeeling of panic, as though I had in about three seconds becomenclaustrophobic. \"I've got to get out of here.\" Taking one of my sparenbandanas, I began filling it with food, and looking around to see if Inforgot anything, I ran my fingers unconsciously over something cool andnsmooth on my bandana. Surprised, I looked down. Pop's medal. . . I remembered how he wore it with pride, how - in a sense - all of hisnworship of honor, truth, and dignity went into the small piece of silver. 'Truth. . .' Lowering my eyes in shame, I slowly unpinned it, and rolled it around sonthat the starlight from the window would make it shine. It was clean andnpolished from many years of careful attendance and dedication to it. . .nFor some reason, it reminded me of Ginger. 'Oh,' I accused myself in frustration, 'a rock would probably make younthink of Ginger!' My features softening, I rolled the trinket around once more. It was likenher spirit. . .clean, pure. . .well-taken care of. . . It was as though shendidn't even realize that she had good looks. 'That's the difference between you and her - and everybody here,' Inthought. 'Their qualities are actually redeemable.' Sighing quietly, Inreverently placed the medal on the old bird's pillow. I moved to pick up the pack that I had made when I felt something rub thenwrong way beneath my wing. . . Paper. . . Slowly, I took out the folded piece of paper, and my countenance darkenednagain. If only I could burn it, or tear it up to pieces. . . \"No,\" I told myself quietly, yet sternly. \"They deserve to know. . .nGinger. . .\" I couldn't bear to finish the thought. My wing shaking, I placed the paper beneath the medal. As I walked out, Insilently prayed that Pops would find it first. * * * Having \"borrowed\" a tricycle and a radio, I quickly set out for the opennroad. I half-expected to find peace there, as I always did when I travelednthrough the countryside, but today. . .had I been pedaling my way into anburning hut, I would have felt just as bad. Trying to get my mind off it all, I turned on the radio and found one of mynfavorite stations. I recognized the song on it, and as the panging in mynheart persisted, I sang all the louder. \"Oh, I'm the type of guy who likes to roll around. I'm never in a place. Inroll from town to town. \"And when I find myself falling for some girl, I hop right in that car. .n.\" Suddenly, I stopped and backtracked. There, high above me came anmanifestation of my fears that I had tried to forget in my leaving. There,nall of them were summed up in four words: \" 'Mrs. Tweedy's Chicken Pies.' \" I felt nauseated. Sensing the decision I was about to make - the one thatnthe Lone Free Ranger in me protested - I gazed back at the farm. \"Ooh boy. . .\" * * * When she was \"dead,\" I felt dead too. When she came back to life, I felt alive again. And when she forgave me. . .I felt, perhaps, that I was redeemable.

Then, when I metnGinger, I began doing the same thing, but I also surprised in myself inncoming up with completely brand-new names. I would like to think that - fornher, at least - they were more terms of *endearment,* but she got offendednnevertheless. And she deserved more than that, I decided earlier tonight. She wasn't annempty, pretty hen; oh, she was pretty all right, but she was just as good-nlooking on the inside as the out. As I sat on Pop's bunk that he had given to me for the night for my act ofn\"heroism,\" I sunk deeper into despair. Glancing briefly over my shoulder, Ingot up and looked into the underside of the metal bucket. I saw a handsomenface, but what else was really there? . . . 'A liar,' I thought bitterly to myself. 'All I see is a no-good liar.' Shendeserved more than that too. Turning away from my awful reflection, I looked around the room with anfeeling of panic, as though I had in about three seconds becomenclaustrophobic. \"I've got to get out of here.\" Taking one of my sparenbandanas, I began filling it with food, and looking around to see if Inforgot anything, I ran my fingers unconsciously over something cool andnsmooth on my bandana. Surprised, I looked down. Pop's medal. . . I remembered how he wore it with pride, how - in a sense - all of hisnworship of honor, truth, and dignity went into the small piece of silver. 'Truth. . .' Lowering my eyes in shame, I slowly unpinned it, and rolled it around sonthat the starlight from the window would make it shine. It was clean andnpolished from many years of careful attendance and dedication to it. . .nFor some reason, it reminded me of Ginger. 'Oh,' I accused myself in frustration, 'a rock would probably make younthink of Ginger!' My features softening, I rolled the trinket around once more. It was likenher spirit. . .clean, pure. . .well-taken care of. . . It was as though shendidn't even realize that she had good looks. 'That's the difference between you and her - and everybody here,' Inthought. 'Their qualities are actually redeemable.' Sighing quietly, Inreverently placed the medal on the old bird's pillow. I moved to pick up the pack that I had made when I felt something rub thenwrong way beneath my wing. . . Paper. . . Slowly, I took out the folded piece of paper, and my countenance darkenednagain. If only I could burn it, or tear it up to pieces. . . \"No,\" I told myself quietly, yet sternly. \"They deserve to know. . .nGinger. . .\" I couldn't bear to finish the thought. My wing shaking, I placed the paper beneath the medal. As I walked out, Insilently prayed that Pops would find it first. * * * Having \"borrowed\" a tricycle and a radio, I quickly set out for the opennroad. I half-expected to find peace there, as I always did when I travelednthrough the countryside, but today. . .had I been pedaling my way into anburning hut, I would have felt just as bad. Trying to get my mind off it all, I turned on the radio and found one of mynfavorite stations. I recognized the song on it, and as the panging in mynheart persisted, I sang all the louder. \"Oh, I'm the type of guy who likes to roll around. I'm never in a place. Inroll from town to town. \"And when I find myself falling for some girl, I hop right in that car. .n.\" Suddenly, I stopped and backtracked. There, high above me came anmanifestation of my fears that I had tried to forget in my leaving. There,nall of them were summed up in four words: \" 'Mrs. Tweedy's Chicken Pies.' \" I felt nauseated. Sensing the decision I was about to make - the one thatnthe Lone Free Ranger in me protested - I gazed back at the farm. \"Ooh boy. . .\" * * * When she was \"dead,\" I felt dead too. When she came back to life, I felt alive again. And when she forgave me. . .I felt, perhaps, that I was redeemable. Everyday, I still feel that sick-happy-feeling for Ginger; except, now, Infinally know what the word is for it.","Summary":" A Feeling You Get By Talking Hawk Author's Note: I've been out of the fanfic loop for quite awhile,","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  K - English - Romance Angst  - Words: 1,683 - Reviews: 11 - Favs: 5 - Published: 7 26 2003 - id: 1446748 "},{"Movie":"Chicken Run","Title":"Fart including","Author":"susanlwade1962","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11511907","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Growl at least one \"Mac\" she said \"sssssshhhh\" Mac sushed \"help\" she said she farts to on face \"sorry\" Mac said longest fart \"eeeew\" Mac said","LastChapter":"Growl at least one \"Mac\" she said \"sssssshhhh\" Mac sushed \"help\" she said she farts to on face \"sorry\" Mac said longest fart \"eeeew\" Mac said","Summary":" Growl at least one \"Mac\" she said \"sssssshhhh\" Mac sushed \"help\" she said she farts to on fac","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  K - English - Humor Poetry  - Words: 26 - Reviews: 2 - Favs: 3 - Follows: 2 - Published: 9 17 2015 - id: 11511907 "},{"Movie":"Chicken Run","Title":"A Dance of Love","Author":"Velvet Dark 007","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/47628","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A Dance of Love Written by Velvet Dark 007 A/N- I may be a Mac and Fowler 'shipper, but I can do Ginger and Rocky.

This will help you understand how Ginger feels- - oh and their free- -oh and the italics are their thoughts- Ginger went out that morning with her water bucket in hand, headed toward the river to collect drinking water. (wow! A water bucket AND water!) She had offered to be the chicken to take care of it, cause she knew Rocky always woke up before everyone else, to take a morning walk and clear his head. Right before she got to the river, she ducked behind a tree. She peered out, and found Rocky strolling along, whistling the song Wild One. (Mel Gipson plays Rocky's part in the movie! awwwww!) (sorry, had to. Now back to the show, uh I mean fic! :]) He then took off his bandana (no perverts, he's not supposed to be stripping) and slowly stepped into the water. \"That's cold, that is definitely cold!\" Rocky then heard some rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned around and saw a green hat laying near a tree. Ginger. He got out of the water, and put his bandana back on. While he was straightening up, Ginger came out of hiding, and came up to the river as though she hadn't been watching. (with her recovered hat) \"Hey Ginger.\" \"Hey Rocky!\" \"Need a little help?\" asked Rocky when he saw that the water (in the water bucket) was a little heavy for her. \"Sure. Thanks.\" He took the bucket, and they began to walk back. Rocky then stumbled to the ground, with the water going all over. \"Ouch! My leg!\" \"Rocky! Are you all right?\" \"I'm fine Baby Doll.\" \"Here, let me help you up.\" Ginger took him by the arms, and got him up on his feet. \"Can you stand?\" Rocky let go of Ginger, but immediately fell while yelling, \"Ow!\" \"Here, come on. Up you go.\" She helped him back up to his feet. \"Let's get you to the coop.\" Well, me breaking my leg isn't so bad. He looked over at her, but she was to busy trying to support his weight to even notice. Things you'll do for love. She shook her head at what she had just thought. \"What?\" asked Rocky. \"Huh?\" \"Why did you just shake your head? Is something wrong?\" \"Oh, umm.....nothing. I just thought that it was kind of, umm.......how much farther do you think it is? She's avoiding the question. Rocky grinned. They finally reached the coop. Ginger got him inside, and sat him on the hay. (bed, nest, whatever you want to call it) \"That's funny, no one's here,\" Ginger said. \"They must all be off gathering food.\" \"Yeah.\" Rocky watched as she got some things for his leg. She wrapped up his leg with some of Babs's knitting stuff. \"Don't ya' wish Babs would REALLY go on Holiday?\" asked Rocky. \"Yeah.\" Ginger laughed. \"Umm, Ginger? I...I just wanted to....umm...to thank you for doing this.\" What are you doing Rocky? Thanking her you dipwawd! Oh yeah. Oh, god! \"Oh, well, you're welcome.\" They both laughed nervously. Ginger walked out of the coop. You're welcome?! What kind of thing is that to say? Just you're welcome?! Well Ginger, old girl, what do you have to say now? You're welcome apparently. Urgh! -next day- Ginger went to see how Rocky was. \"Hey Ginge! (the r is left off purposefully) I missed ya'!\" Woa! \"I mean....umm.....I think my leg's getting' better.\" Yes! Great recovery! \"Glad to hear of it. I wanted to take a walk with you this morning.\" Oh my god! Did I just say that?! Yes I did. Great going. \"I mean...umm...I thought that we could try to get you walking again. And I thought if you could....umm....try to walk, you might recover faster.\" Great recovery! Only, I hope he kind of got that hint that accidently slipped out. Or was it an accident? Of course it was! This is getting very complicated! I might have to go ask Mac about this. \"Sure!\" replied Rocky. Ginger helped him up, and they went outside. They walked for a little while, heading toward the river. \"Umm, there's something I got to tell ya'.\" Rocy said nervously. \"What's that?\" Rocky gave a little laugh to release his tension. \"Are you laughing at me?!\" \"No! I was just.....\" Ginger started to leave. \"Wait!\" Rocky grabbed hold of her wing. \"What are you doing?\" Ginger tried to get her wing away from him. Then he pulled her close to him and kissed her. She walked away stunned. She heard Rocky in the background saying, \"I love you Ginger.\" * * * -next day- Rocky was tired from having to walk back to the coop, since Ginger left him in the woods. She didn't take care of him anymore; she sent Babs to look after him, since she was too embarrassed to look him in the eye. The next day -after Mac reset his leg- Babs was re-wrapping his leg. \"So Mr. Roads, how is your Holiday going?\" asked Babs. Rocky shook his head, and replied, \"Fine Babs, just fine.\" \"That's good.\" Ginger suddenly came into the door. \"Umm, Babs, you're needed to try and get Fowler out of his predicament.\" \"What kind of predicament?\" asked Babs. \"Well, it seems that Fowler was trying to....umm....goose Bunty, and it got kind of messy. We need you to make an eyepatch, and probably some other things, but we can't be certain.\" (yes, I know Mac and Fowler are usually together, but I can't see that, cause Fowler is old. And I can picture him as a naughty Grandpa. lol) Babs left the coop, and left Rocky and Ginger alone in uncomfortable silence. Ginger was shuffling her feet, while Rocky was rubbing the back of his head. (you know, like he does in the movie. -just wanted to clear that up-) But Ginger was the first one to break the silence. \"So....umm....is your leg feeling better?\" \"Yeah. Umm, you wanta' sit down?\" \"Sh....shure.\" Ginger moved to slowly to where he was sitting, and sat herself down on the edge of the hay. She kept her head down, because she still couldn't look him in the eye. \"Sooooo, about yesterday,\" said Rocky. Ginger instinctively looked up. \"I...I...just wanted to....umm...well, I didn't mean to....uh....\" \"The....the....that's okay,\" replied Ginger. \"I was just, kind of....(she cleared her throat). \" \"Well, my leg's, umm, getting better and Mac is going to throw me a party, and I just thought that, well, maybe you could come with me tonight, maybe?\" \"I have a lot of work to do tonight,sooooo......\" \"Oh, okay.\" Rocky replied sadly. \"But hey, I mean, it can wait, can't it?\" \"Really? Uh, I mean, okay. See ya' tonight?\" \"Okay. Bye Rocky.\" \"Bye.\" * * * -later that night- \"Come on Rocky, old boy. Get yourself together.\" Rocky was standing in front of his mirror, talking to himself. \"Let's see....\" He took of his bandana. \"Nope. Hmm.... Oh, come on! It's just Ginger!\" Exactly! He fixed his hair (hair?) and said, \"Oh well.\" And headed for Mac's coop. \"Come on Ginger, old girl. Get yourself together.\" Ginger was standing in front of her mirror, talking to herself. (deja vu) \"Let's see....\" She took off her hat, and her hair (?) went to the sides. \"Ewwww!\" and she put it back on. \"Hmm.... Oh, come on! It's just Rocky!\" Exactly! She sprayed on some perfume and said, \"That'll have to do.\" And headed for Mac's coop. Rocky walked in to the coop. Everyone was dancing and yelling. Mac greeted him. \"So,\" Rocky said. \"You started the party without me.\" \"Aye, they were gettin' a restless.\" \"Ah, I see. Ya' guys got anything to drink?\" he asked, rubbing his wings together. \"Yeah, it's right ova' thare.\" \"Thanks. Oh, and is Ginger here yet?\" \"No. Why do ya' ask?\" Rocky rolled his eyes. And they call her the smartest chicken?! Ginger walked in. Everyone was dancing, but she was looking for Rocky. Rocky had a cup in his hand, with other chicks surrounding him. He was saying, \"And the skunk says to Babs.....\" Then he spotted Ginger. You know-with one of those \"oh my god it's her!\" looks on his face. Bunty shut his mouth for him. He handed his cup to someone; he didn't know who, and stood up. Ginger was looking around, but couldn't find him. She turned around, and saw Rocky slowly coming her way. Oh, he's coming! What have I got myself into now? He asked himself. \"Hey, Ginger.\" \"Hi Rocky.\" A slow song came on. (I would pretend it was N*SYNC's This I Promise You, even though I don't care for them, I love that song!\" \"Umm, you wanta' dance?\" asked Rocky. \"Sure.\" Rocky took her wing, and guided her to the middle of the dance floor. They moved closer to each other. He put his wing around her waist, as so did she. He took her other wing, and they started dancing. Everyone had stopped, and was watching the couple; but Rocky and Ginger was too wrapped up in each other to notice. Babs goes to Bunty, \"This is a very nice holiday, don't you think?\" Bunty just rolles her eyes. They move even closer to each other, and Ginger puts her beak on Rocky's shoulder. The song is almost done, when Rocky gently lifts Ginger's head off his shoulder. They gaze into each other's eyes, then Rocky slowly kisses her. (yeah baby! -sorry! I know I ruined the mood! Bad stephanie, bad, bad!-) * * * -during the party- Rocky and Ginger sit on top of a coop together, hand in hand...er...wing in wing, gazing at the full moon. Ginger rests her head on his shoulder. \"So,\" Rocky asks. \"What are ya' doing tomorrow night?\" (A.N. Yes yes, I know. But I HAVE to put humor in it! So, did ya' like the story?

After the car accident that killed her parents, she packed everything that she owned. Everything else was left behind in that big house. Of course, little Nellie, only thirteen would receive her inheritance once she came of age. Upon arriving at the dismal Tweedy farm with only a suitcase in her hand, she looked around. It looked more like a prison than a farm, in her opinion. She had lived in the busy city of London and had traveled by bus to the northern part of the countryside of Yorkshire. It was quiet, something Nellie wasn't used to. She had never met her aunt Melisha. Her mother said that she was a very bitter woman whom she had tried to reconcile with many times. And now here she was meeting her for the first time ever. She knocked on the door, trembling. It was opened by a short, fat man who eyed her up and down. The little teenager with black hair and dark blue eyes. Her face dotted with light freckles. She looked uneasy. \"Come in,\" says the man who was known as her uncle. Trembling, Nellie clutched her suitcase with her hands until her knuckles were white, looking around her new home. It was just as dismal as the outside. A typical home for a farmer. \"Melisha,\" said her uncle. \"She's is here.\" Melisha Tweedy looked up from her papers after her usual routine of egg gathering when she heard her husband's voice. Immediately she felt revulsion and disgust upon hearing that the only child of her sister was here. She despised her sister, Eleanor: the pretty one who got all the attention. She got everything she wanted. A spoiled brat. She married a rich man. All she married was a farmer...a petty chicken farmer. And now this little whelp, the exact same copy of her younger sister was here. She looked over the small girl. Oh yes! EXACTLY like her mother. Pretty. Perfect. A child spoiled by riches. Nellie looked down at her feet, uncomfortable to be meeting her Aunt Melisha, swallowing. Everything about this woman was a bit unapproachable. She saw this tall, slender woman with a worn, weary look. Her dark hair pulled back into a tight bun. Her face expressed bitterness. Her dress was wool. Her dark eyes looked mean and cold. \"So...you're here,\" says Aunt Melisha bluntly. \"Don't expect to be pampered while you're here.\" Nellie didn't speak. She was too afraid to say anything. Just looked at the floor. \"C'mere,\" she said with a beckoning hand. Nellie approached her desk with slow caution; the floor creaked under her Paten-leather Mary Janes. Melisha looked over the small girl again. Spoiled. Perfect. Pretty. Now that her stupid sister was dead, she intended to shape this little clone of her mother. Make her work. Ruin her beauty. Yet, the girl had money...which she wouldn't get until she came of age. It wasn't fair! \"Lemme see your hands,\" Melisha says. Nellie wondered why she would ask such a thing. Shaking, she removed her gloves and showed her. Melisha looked over those hands: small, lily-white and flawless. How she remembered they were once like that. Not any more. Now they were rough and calloused, ruined from hard labor. \"Lemme see your arm,\" she says. Nellie looked confused by this request. \"Flex a muscle, you dolt,\" she said impatient. Nellie slowly removed her coat, dressed in a black dress and rolled up the sleeve, flexing a muscle for her aunt. Melisha reached for the girl's arm and felt it. It was soft and unspoiled. Hard labor would get her to build up those muscles. Nellie flinched at the touch; it felt foreign and strange. \"Hm,\" says Melisha. \"You're skinny and unspoiled. But you'll do anyway.\" \"I...\" Nellie spoke. \"I don't understand. What do you mean?\" \"Well, you're living in this house,\" replied Melisha. \"I expect you to not laze about while you're here. There are no servants to attend your little needs. You need to take care of yourself...and help out around here. In farmland, we all help out here.\" \"But...\" Nellie was about to protest. \"Yes?\" says Melisha, her dark eyes slits, scaring the child. Nellie silenced immediately. It seemed her aunt wanted no complaints. Another swallow. \"Good,\" she said. \"Now your clothes. They're not appropriate here. I'll make you some new ones tomorrow. For now go on upstairs. Your uncle Willard will show you your room.\" Nellie was shown to her room; a dark, dank room. She sighed as she sat on the bed with her suitcase. She didn't like this place at all. It was scary. These people who were her so called family were strangers. And now they expected her to work?! She laid on the bed, completely overwhelmed. She cried, missing her parents, her home. Being here was terrible. A soft knock came at the door and came the humble voice of her uncle announcing dinner. Nellie came out and walked down the stairs, still uneasy. Nellie wasn't really hungry and picked at her dinner. The entire dinner was eaten in complete silence. Eventually, Melisha got up and walked back to her desk, muttering and pushing buttons on a calculator. Then she muttered curses under her breath, shoving the paperwork off. \"Goddamn useless things!\" she said. Nellie and Willard flinched. They were scared to move. Nellie was just about to leave... \"And where do you think you are going?\" she said in a sinisterly voice. Nellie was too scared to answer. \"Yea, I didn't think so,\" she said. \"Now take the dishes to the kitchen and wash them. They'd better be shiny and I'd better not see one drop of water any where.\" Nellie slowly felt herself turn around and obeying. She licked her lips nervously and swallowed. She carried the dishes to the kitchen and began to wash. She looked so unsure. \"Use hot water,\" said Willard. The girl saw her uncle standing there. He smiled a little at his niece even though they barely knew each other. He approached slowly, filling the sink with water and showed her how it was done. Nellie swallowed nervously. \"Go ahead,\" he said sofly. Nellie approached thw sink rolling up her sleeves. The water scalded her her hands, making them raw. They began to hurt after using a dish rag and soap. Her dress got soaked. She placed the dishes in the rack so they would dry, the cleaned up the after mess, making sure there was no water or soap. \"Don't worry,\" said Willard. \"You'll get used to it eventually.\" Another small smile from the short man. \"Um...thanks, I guess,\" Nellie said quietly. He nodded lightly.[Chapter 2] Prisoners Nellie lied in bed, having a dreamless sleep. She was uncomfortable. She couldn't sleep her first night there. She spent it the entire night staring at the ceiling. It was cold. The bed was narrow and hard. She pulled her sweater tightly to keep herself warm. She heard the rooster crowing and blinked her eyes, wondering what time it was. She saw it was still dark out. She grabbed the pillow and pulled it over her head in hopes to drown out the annoying shrill sound. A harsh knock on the door startled her. She saw Mrs Tweedy standing there, already dressed. She held something in the crook of her thin arm. \"Let's go!\" she barked. \"But it's still dark out,\" Nellie said. \"Oh I'm sorry, your Highness,\" Mrs Tweedy said sarcastically. \"I didn't know you needed your beauty sleep to make yourself beautiful.\" She glared at the little whelp who dared protest with dark icy eyes, making her tremble. \"Now if I hear another protest out of you, you will rue the day you were born. Is that clear?\" Nellie was shaking so hard with fear. \"Y-yes ma'am,\" she replied with a quiver in her voice. Mrs Tweedy stared coldly, but appeared pleased. \"Good. Now, here's your new clothes.\" Nellie looked over the dress. It was a horrible tweed color made of itchy wool. Once alone, she stepped out of her nightgown. She pulled on a slip, some stockings, which she attached to a garters. She slipped on the horrible dress and found it was a bit big on her. She plaited her hair in pigtails. She didn't know what shoes to wear and pulled out a pair of loafers. She went downstairs slowly, her head down. Mr Tweedy greeted her with a silent smile. Nellie did the same. \"I don't think you should wear those,\" he said pointing to her shoes. \"Working on a farm is quite dirty. Y'might want to use these.\" He held up a pair of black rubber boots. Nellie frowned. She didn't like getting dirty. She didn't like that she had to wear such common clothes. She didn't like living here. \"O-OK,\" she said. \"Um...thanks, I suppose.\" She went outside with her uncle, who showed her the ropes, collecting the eggs from the chicken house. She felt sick from the smell, holding back the urge to vomit. She thought chickens were beautiful, but never had she expected it to smell so horrid. She wished she had some kind of menthol oil to deal with the smell. She saw Mr Tweedy head over to a coal bin and out came a small red chicken. Nellie was a bit shocked and confused. \"Why was that chicken in there?\" she asked curious. \"It tried to escape,\" he explained. Another frown from his niece. Nellie's parents who advocated against the cruelty of all animals. They were members of the Birdlife International. Her first task was to feed the chickens. Nellie grabbed a huge bag. She fell a few times, trying to lift it or it slipped out of her arms, landing on her toes. Unable to carry the bag, she grabbed it by the corners and dragged it. It was so bloody heavy! She wanted to complain, but after seeing the missus's stare this morning, she best keep it to herself. By the time she got it to the feed box, she was sweaty and exhausted. A feeling she didn't like. Panting and wiping the sweat off her head, she tried to pick up the bag. She struggled...even slipping a few times, skinning her knee. Her stocking was ruined. She tried again to get the damn feed in the feed box, struggling and straining with all her strength. The bag spilled all over the ground. Nellie looked at the mess, so overwhelmed... she wanted to scream...maybe cry. But what would be the point? Neither of them solved problems. \"Fuck!\" she cursed between her teeth. Nellie rarely cursed since it was considered improper for ladies. She only did it when she was alone or really frustrated. \"And Eleanor said she raised a lady,\" Mrs Tweedy said, her arms crossed. \"And yet, your language is common and coarse...like a sailor.\" \"I...\" Nellie stammered, embarrassed. \"I'm sorry...it just...slipped out. I won't do it again.\" Mrs Tweedy rolled her eyes. She was so pathetic...like her sister. \"You wasted a lot of feed there, idiot girl,\" she added with a glare. \"Do you have any idea how much this costs?\" Nellie sucked in her lips, words stuck in her throat. She just shook her head with an inaudible \"no, ma'am.\" \"Sorry. Didn't quite hear that,\" Mrs Tweedy replied sarcastically. \"No, ma'am,\" she repeated a little louder. \"Sorry. What was that?\" \"No, ma'am!\" Nellie answered with emphasis, feeling humiliated. Mrs Tweedy scoffed. \"Yea. I didn't think so,\" she mocked. Then with a scornful expression, seeing her sister there, but smaller, she continued with bitterness, \"You rich people take everything for granted. You talk of being generous to the needy and poor when the reality is you're nothing but selfish, lazy, wasteful swine filled with greed.\" Nellie wasn't sure how to respond. A flush came to her cheeks, a mingle of rage and humiliation. What did she do? She didn't understand. \"I...I'm sorry,\" Nellie answered in attempt to be diplomatic, wringing her hands. \"Is that all you have to say? You think 'sorry' is going to fix problems? Because it doesn't.\" A swallow from the girl, shaking. She treaded carefully with her question. \"Is there something I can do?\" Another scornful look from Mrs Tweedy, she shook her head. This whelp was truly pathetic. Just like her sister, kissing the back of everyone's trousers. Always a people pleaser. \"Just clean this up,\" she responded, gesturing to the spilled feed. Nellie nodded. Upon her aunt's leaving, she was so relieved she was gone. She was certain she was going to piss her knickers after that. She felt like a weight was lifted away. Kneeling with reluctant disgust, she picked up the spilled feed. She could sort of understand her aunt's bitterness of being poor...and a farmer's wife. It was degrading and humiliating. A rich girl forced to work like some commoner. She hated it. Her pride had completely crumbled. Nellie used every ounce of sheer will not to cry. She heaved breaths to calm herself. A good cry into her pillow tonight would help. What was the use? Tears spilled from her blue eyes, her body convulsed and soft sobs emitted from her lips. Sniffling, she pushed back her hurt pride and swallowed it, walling off her feelings. She wasn't a child. She had to act like a mature lady. Well-bred. Not anymore. A tear landed on the ground. She wiped away the beginnings of them with her knuckle. She continued to pick up the feed. The chickens saw the teenage female, kneeling in the dirt. She looked really pitiful. They were uneasy of how to approach the teenager...curious even. They had never seen her before. \"She looks nice,\" said Babs with a smile. \"Oh please!\" said Bunty with an eye roll. \"We can't trust humans.\" \"You think she's here on holiday?\" Babs said. \"I don't think so,\" said Ginger. After finishing this, Nellie picked herself up and dragged the bag back to the barn. By supper, her entire body hurt. Her hands had horrible blisters. She was filthy. She didn't like it at all. A warm bath would do after supper. There was something she wanted to discuss with the Tweedys. She really didn't like how the chickens were treated. She had seen a select few try to get out...a ginger one was getting tossed in the coal bin just recently...then let out after a couple of hours. \"Aunt Melisha?\" Nellie said. \"Yes?\" she replied not even looking from her dinner. \"I want to talk about...something.\" \"What?\" \"It's about the treatment of the chickens. Don't you think locking them in a coal bin seems a bit...harsh?\" Melisha slowly looked as the whelp dared to question her. \"And?\" \"Well, it's just...maybe if you were a bit more kinder to them, maybe they'd be less likely to...escape?\" Melisha cocked an eyebrow. She felt anger boiling. \"Why the bloody hell do you care?\" she spat. \"What are you, some kind of animal rights activist? Was that rich Daddy of yours a Kosher man?\" \"Actually, y...\" Nellie was about to answer. \"They're chickens, you whelp! Apart from you, they are the most stupid creatures created on earth. Worthless nothings put on this earth to serve for two purposes: lay eggs. And when they're no longer useful, food. So if you have some kind of problem with how I run things here, you better just keep it to yourself. Is that clear?\" \"But...\" Nellie said. \"Get out!\" she shrieked. Nellie ran outside, her heart pounding...to her horror, she heard the door lock click. Nellie was left outside! She twisted the doorknob...rattling the door. \"Let me in!\" she shouted. \"Stupid worthless girl,\" Mrs Tweedy grumbled. \"That'll teach her to question me.\" Mr Tweedy frowned as he heard the pleading of his niece. He didn't think that was fair. \"Don't you dare touch that door,\" hissed Mrs Tweedy as he reached for the door. \"B-but, love,\" said Mr Tweedy. \"Isn't that a bit...harsh, leaving her outside? She'll catch a cold.\" \"You can join her if you wish,\" she answered harshly, crossing his arms. Mr Tweedy lowered his head in defeat. He had no choice. The missus could be vindictive if she got angry. Best not to get on her bad side. Nellie sighed in resignation. She shivered and tucked her hands under her arms. Where was she supposed to sleep? Strolling towards the barn, kicking a rock, she saw a flash of red...Nellie looked but saw nothing. To her dismay, the barn was locked. A bitter look from the girl as she kicked the door. Sighing in defeat, she slumped against a chicken wire fence, making it clink. The frown deepened on Nellie's face. \"Shit,\" she hissed. Ginger saw the sulky teenager. She was left outside...or shut out from what she had seen. She heard the teenage female shout at the door, tugging and twisting the doorknob. After a few moments, the teenager gave up...looking for another place for shelter. It was a cold night. Ginger had to fluff her feathers just after stepping outside. She didn't know how to approach the teenager. She was rather quiet...even disgusted with the farm. Definitely not from here. The teenager let out a curse as she leaned on the fence, tucking her hands in the pockets of her sweater. She pulled out a box and a match, lighting it. There was a smooth stream of smoke. Between her fingers was a thin white stick that glowed orange in the night. Nellie decided to have a smoke. Better than crying. She picked up the habit at prep school with some of the girls. She took a lungful of smoke and exhaled, looking at the stars. Nellie didn't smoke often...just at times she was stressed. The problem was hiding it. She always kept mouthwash nearby, perfume. She smoked outside and downwind. Classic ways of not getting caught. Her parents certainly wouldn't approve. They said smoking made ladies look unattractive and it was improper. Yet she had seen all the elegant young ladies do it at parties on those long cigarette holders. Why shouldn't she? She wasn't sure about her new family, but who cared? They sure as hell didn't. Ginger got close to the teenager and saw she was smoking. She recognized it since the farmer did it with his pipe by the window every night after supper. Nellie heard footsteps behind her and saw a ginger colored chicken, staring curiously at her. Nellie wasn't sure. She hated the uncomfortable silence. She wanted to have some kind of conversation, but talking to a bird? Was she that desperate...or mad? The bird was staring at her. Again it made her uncomfortable. To break the awkward silence, she spoke. \"Don't worry, I'm not on guard duty.\" Jesus! I'm talking to a chicken! I have gone mad! Nellie thought. Ginger was surprised the teenager spoke to her. She never expected a human to speak to her. The least interaction she got from humans was the farmer or his wife. They spoke to her like she was dirt...well the farmer, at least. His wife just ignored them and was a woman of little words. Just how little she spoke and her stare was frightening enough. She ruled the chicken farm with a cold, iron fist. Her demeanor was domineering, colder than an icy wind...she even made the farmer scared. Another inhale of smoke and blew a stream of smoke. Ginger watched the teenager. She took a few more puffs of her cigarette and stomped it out in the mud. She really wanted to preserve her supply of cigarettes since she probably wouldn't be able to get more. Yet tonight would be an exception. She was forced to sleep outside, alone in the cold, English countryside. This place was no home to her. It was a prison. She pulled out another cigarette and lit it, taking a deep lungful and exhaled slowly. \"Don't say anything to the mister and missus about my bad habit,\" Nellie said. \"I won't say anything about your escaping.\" Ginger listened. She felt a connection to the teenager. A little wary, but nonetheless... could she trust this human? She had a distrust for humans. Yet this one was...different. \"Looks like we're both prisoners here,\" Nellie said to the chicken, flicking ash on the ground. \"I'd want to escape from here if I were you...and if I knew where to go.\" The chicken stared at Nellie. Was it listening? Not that it mattered. She saw it...nodded? Blinking her eyes a few times. Had she gone round the bend?! Did the chicken just respond to her? She shook her head, thinking it was just the high from the nicotine. After finishing her last smoke, Nellie sat down on the ground. It was still damp and cold. Shivering, she drew her legs in to keep warm. She was sure she would freeze. She closed her eyes in an attempt to sleep... Ginger wondered if she should she say something and risk the secret. The girl was left outside and it was getting colder by the minute. Ginger went back to Hut 17. \"Ladies,\" said Ginger. \"The girl's been left outside. We should help. Babs, how fast can you knit?\" \"On it!\" she said cheerfully, clinking her knitting needles. \"Are you sure you can trust that...human?\" Bunty said skeptical. \"This one, yes.\" A few of the chickens went outside, seeing the shivering teenager. Nellie felt she was going numb. The chickens climbed on top of each other, standing on their shoulders. They tossed the blanket over the fence, in hopes of avoiding the barbed wire. It was a perfect shot! Right on her lap. Upon seeing the teenager stir, the chickens scattered quickly and out of sight. Nellie blinked her eyes open, finding a knitted blanket. Cocking an eyebrow, she wondered where it came from. Shrugging, she just wrapped it around her shoulders, walking towards the porch to one of the chairs to sleep. After drifting between sleep and awake, who knew how long it had been going on, she heard the door open and saw Mr Tweedy standing there. \"Come inside,\" he said quietly. Nellie got up stiffly and nodded, going inside.","LastChapter":"Prisoners Nellie lied in bed, having a dreamless sleep. She was uncomfortable. She couldn't sleep her first night there.

Nellie looked at the mess, so overwhelmed... she wanted to scream...maybe cry. But what would be the point? Neither of them solved problems. \"Fuck!\" she cursed between her teeth. Nellie rarely cursed since it was considered improper for ladies. She only did it when she was alone or really frustrated. \"And Eleanor said she raised a lady,\" Mrs Tweedy said, her arms crossed. \"And yet, your language is common and coarse...like a sailor.\" \"I...\" Nellie stammered, embarrassed. \"I'm sorry...it just...slipped out. I won't do it again.\" Mrs Tweedy rolled her eyes. She was so pathetic...like her sister. \"You wasted a lot of feed there, idiot girl,\" she added with a glare. \"Do you have any idea how much this costs?\" Nellie sucked in her lips, words stuck in her throat. She just shook her head with an inaudible \"no, ma'am.\" \"Sorry. Didn't quite hear that,\" Mrs Tweedy replied sarcastically. \"No, ma'am,\" she repeated a little louder. \"Sorry. What was that?\" \"No, ma'am!\" Nellie answered with emphasis, feeling humiliated. Mrs Tweedy scoffed. \"Yea. I didn't think so,\" she mocked. Then with a scornful expression, seeing her sister there, but smaller, she continued with bitterness, \"You rich people take everything for granted. You talk of being generous to the needy and poor when the reality is you're nothing but selfish, lazy, wasteful swine filled with greed.\" Nellie wasn't sure how to respond. A flush came to her cheeks, a mingle of rage and humiliation. What did she do? She didn't understand. \"I...I'm sorry,\" Nellie answered in attempt to be diplomatic, wringing her hands. \"Is that all you have to say? You think 'sorry' is going to fix problems? Because it doesn't.\" A swallow from the girl, shaking. She treaded carefully with her question. \"Is there something I can do?\" Another scornful look from Mrs Tweedy, she shook her head. This whelp was truly pathetic. Just like her sister, kissing the back of everyone's trousers. Always a people pleaser. \"Just clean this up,\" she responded, gesturing to the spilled feed. Nellie nodded. Upon her aunt's leaving, she was so relieved she was gone. She was certain she was going to piss her knickers after that. She felt like a weight was lifted away. Kneeling with reluctant disgust, she picked up the spilled feed. She could sort of understand her aunt's bitterness of being poor...and a farmer's wife. It was degrading and humiliating. A rich girl forced to work like some commoner. She hated it. Her pride had completely crumbled. Nellie used every ounce of sheer will not to cry. She heaved breaths to calm herself. A good cry into her pillow tonight would help. What was the use? Tears spilled from her blue eyes, her body convulsed and soft sobs emitted from her lips. Sniffling, she pushed back her hurt pride and swallowed it, walling off her feelings. She wasn't a child. She had to act like a mature lady. Well-bred. Not anymore. A tear landed on the ground. She wiped away the beginnings of them with her knuckle. She continued to pick up the feed. The chickens saw the teenage female, kneeling in the dirt. She looked really pitiful. They were uneasy of how to approach the teenager...curious even. They had never seen her before. \"She looks nice,\" said Babs with a smile. \"Oh please!\" said Bunty with an eye roll. \"We can't trust humans.\" \"You think she's here on holiday?\" Babs said. \"I don't think so,\" said Ginger. After finishing this, Nellie picked herself up and dragged the bag back to the barn. By supper, her entire body hurt. Her hands had horrible blisters. She was filthy. She didn't like it at all. A warm bath would do after supper. There was something she wanted to discuss with the Tweedys. She really didn't like how the chickens were treated. She had seen a select few try to get out...a ginger one was getting tossed in the coal bin just recently...then let out after a couple of hours. \"Aunt Melisha?\" Nellie said. \"Yes?\" she replied not even looking from her dinner. \"I want to talk about...something.\" \"What?\" \"It's about the treatment of the chickens. Don't you think locking them in a coal bin seems a bit...harsh?\" Melisha slowly looked as the whelp dared to question her. \"And?\" \"Well, it's just...maybe if you were a bit more kinder to them, maybe they'd be less likely to...escape?\" Melisha cocked an eyebrow. She felt anger boiling. \"Why the bloody hell do you care?\" she spat. \"What are you, some kind of animal rights activist? Was that rich Daddy of yours a Kosher man?\" \"Actually, y...\" Nellie was about to answer. \"They're chickens, you whelp! Apart from you, they are the most stupid creatures created on earth. Worthless nothings put on this earth to serve for two purposes: lay eggs. And when they're no longer useful, food. So if you have some kind of problem with how I run things here, you better just keep it to yourself. Is that clear?\" \"But...\" Nellie said. \"Get out!\" she shrieked. Nellie ran outside, her heart pounding...to her horror, she heard the door lock click. Nellie was left outside! She twisted the doorknob...rattling the door. \"Let me in!\" she shouted. \"Stupid worthless girl,\" Mrs Tweedy grumbled. \"That'll teach her to question me.\" Mr Tweedy frowned as he heard the pleading of his niece. He didn't think that was fair. \"Don't you dare touch that door,\" hissed Mrs Tweedy as he reached for the door. \"B-but, love,\" said Mr Tweedy. \"Isn't that a bit...harsh, leaving her outside? She'll catch a cold.\" \"You can join her if you wish,\" she answered harshly, crossing his arms. Mr Tweedy lowered his head in defeat. He had no choice. The missus could be vindictive if she got angry. Best not to get on her bad side. Nellie sighed in resignation. She shivered and tucked her hands under her arms. Where was she supposed to sleep? Strolling towards the barn, kicking a rock, she saw a flash of red...Nellie looked but saw nothing. To her dismay, the barn was locked. A bitter look from the girl as she kicked the door. Sighing in defeat, she slumped against a chicken wire fence, making it clink. The frown deepened on Nellie's face. \"Shit,\" she hissed. Ginger saw the sulky teenager. She was left outside...or shut out from what she had seen. She heard the teenage female shout at the door, tugging and twisting the doorknob. After a few moments, the teenager gave up...looking for another place for shelter. It was a cold night. Ginger had to fluff her feathers just after stepping outside. She didn't know how to approach the teenager. She was rather quiet...even disgusted with the farm. Definitely not from here. The teenager let out a curse as she leaned on the fence, tucking her hands in the pockets of her sweater. She pulled out a box and a match, lighting it. There was a smooth stream of smoke. Between her fingers was a thin white stick that glowed orange in the night. Nellie decided to have a smoke. Better than crying. She picked up the habit at prep school with some of the girls. She took a lungful of smoke and exhaled, looking at the stars. Nellie didn't smoke often...just at times she was stressed. The problem was hiding it. She always kept mouthwash nearby, perfume. She smoked outside and downwind. Classic ways of not getting caught. Her parents certainly wouldn't approve. They said smoking made ladies look unattractive and it was improper. Yet she had seen all the elegant young ladies do it at parties on those long cigarette holders. Why shouldn't she? She wasn't sure about her new family, but who cared? They sure as hell didn't. Ginger got close to the teenager and saw she was smoking. She recognized it since the farmer did it with his pipe by the window every night after supper. Nellie heard footsteps behind her and saw a ginger colored chicken, staring curiously at her. Nellie wasn't sure. She hated the uncomfortable silence. She wanted to have some kind of conversation, but talking to a bird? Was she that desperate...or mad? The bird was staring at her. Again it made her uncomfortable. To break the awkward silence, she spoke. \"Don't worry, I'm not on guard duty.\" Jesus! I'm talking to a chicken! I have gone mad! Nellie thought. Ginger was surprised the teenager spoke to her. She never expected a human to speak to her. The least interaction she got from humans was the farmer or his wife. They spoke to her like she was dirt...well the farmer, at least. His wife just ignored them and was a woman of little words. Just how little she spoke and her stare was frightening enough. She ruled the chicken farm with a cold, iron fist. Her demeanor was domineering, colder than an icy wind...she even made the farmer scared. Another inhale of smoke and blew a stream of smoke. Ginger watched the teenager. She took a few more puffs of her cigarette and stomped it out in the mud. She really wanted to preserve her supply of cigarettes since she probably wouldn't be able to get more. Yet tonight would be an exception. She was forced to sleep outside, alone in the cold, English countryside. This place was no home to her. It was a prison. She pulled out another cigarette and lit it, taking a deep lungful and exhaled slowly. \"Don't say anything to the mister and missus about my bad habit,\" Nellie said. \"I won't say anything about your escaping.\" Ginger listened. She felt a connection to the teenager. A little wary, but nonetheless... could she trust this human? She had a distrust for humans. Yet this one was...different. \"Looks like we're both prisoners here,\" Nellie said to the chicken, flicking ash on the ground. \"I'd want to escape from here if I were you...and if I knew where to go.\" The chicken stared at Nellie. Was it listening? Not that it mattered. She saw it...nodded? Blinking her eyes a few times. Had she gone round the bend?! Did the chicken just respond to her? She shook her head, thinking it was just the high from the nicotine. After finishing her last smoke, Nellie sat down on the ground. It was still damp and cold. Shivering, she drew her legs in to keep warm. She was sure she would freeze. She closed her eyes in an attempt to sleep... Ginger wondered if she should she say something and risk the secret. The girl was left outside and it was getting colder by the minute. Ginger went back to Hut 17. \"Ladies,\" said Ginger. \"The girl's been left outside. We should help. Babs, how fast can you knit?\" \"On it!\" she said cheerfully, clinking her knitting needles. \"Are you sure you can trust that...human?\" Bunty said skeptical. \"This one, yes.\" A few of the chickens went outside, seeing the shivering teenager. Nellie felt she was going numb. The chickens climbed on top of each other, standing on their shoulders. They tossed the blanket over the fence, in hopes of avoiding the barbed wire. It was a perfect shot! Right on her lap. Upon seeing the teenager stir, the chickens scattered quickly and out of sight. Nellie blinked her eyes open, finding a knitted blanket. Cocking an eyebrow, she wondered where it came from. Shrugging, she just wrapped it around her shoulders, walking towards the porch to one of the chairs to sleep. After drifting between sleep and awake, who knew how long it had been going on, she heard the door open and saw Mr Tweedy standing there. \"Come inside,\" he said quietly. Nellie got up stiffly and nodded, going inside.","Summary":" Arrival Nellie Kingsleigh arrived at her aunt and uncle's farm in Yorkshire.

I'm catfreaklol and well I like the movie Chicken Run. I decided to make a story based on it, but I didn't know how. Then one day, while I was looking at all the stories... I came across a story call Rooster Run by SomeRAndomGal. Well, that story was based on the movie, but through Rocky's eyes, so I got the idea to one like it and this time through Ginger's eyes. Since I'm new to this website and is 13 years old please R&R;, it will be a lot of help to me and know my errors. :) Ginger So, like yeah, I'm Ginger and I obviously live in a chicken farm. Since we're chickens, life is just, well, laying eggs, getting plucked, and then getting roasted into the oven. 'Are we still on, hen?' 'Yes we're on. Spread the word Mac.' 'Aye' This plan has to work. It has to be worth more than one bag of seeds and a whole lot of trouble. Come to think of it, I wonder how the rats are so sneaky… well they are rats. I hope they bring a big light weighted spoon. I guess I will head to hut 16 for our meeting. Great... It's gonna take me an hour to keep the chickens quiet. Think, Ginger, think! Oh I know what to do. 'Everyone, BE QUIET!' Wow, that actually works… for the first time. Now time for me and Mac to tell our latest plan. I just hope I don't end up in solitary confinement again. 'Ok, Mac, would you like to explain our new plan?' 'Aye… Ok everyone, look … This is Ginger and over here is the spoon. Ginger runs to the spoon and makes a hole. Then we go under after her.' 'Hmmm, not bad. I guess we can give it a try.' Seriously Bunty? Give it a try? Well, I know how you feel about this and I understand. Now to look for the rats and tell them the location of the spoon. -At Night- Great. Mr. Tweedy is guarding the fence again! I will just have to wait, wait, wait, and NOW! Phew! That was close. Okay, here's the spoon and now to dig! Oh come on…I will to have hide. The dogs have a lot of senses and Mr. Tweedy had to turn around. Oh good… okay to continue digging. Now, time to see if we can fit. Okay, if I can fit, they can fight too, right? I signal them to come over, so they can go under the fence. They made a little bit of noise, but good old Bunty shushed them. Even from far away I can hear Babs whimpering. Ok, so Bunty is going under first. 'I'm stuck.' *sigh* Seriously Bunty? Oh well, I guess I will have to come over and help. Oh no! The dogs caught us! Great! They are barking too. 'Get back' Looks like I will end up in solitary confinement once again. Now to push Bunty back into the fence and NOW TO RUN! 'Hmmm' Yeah Hmmm Mr. Tweedy! It's me again! I'm getting tired. I wish there was a hiding place. Guess I will go up the stairs. Great! I'm trapped. Hey, there's a gnome behind me. It's good enough for a weapon… ah never mind the dog bit the head off. Huh? The door just opened and a lot of bright light is coming out. *GULP* Mrs. Tweedy! 'Mr. Tweedy' 'Eh' 'What is that chicken doing outside the fence?' 'Oh-he he, I don't know love, I – ' 'Just deal with it-NOW!' Okay Mr. Tweedy you are now frowning at me, but trust me ending up in solitary confinement won't stop me from trying to escape the farm! Oh yeah and congrats for getting in trouble with Mrs. Tweedy! 'I'll teach you to make a fool out of me!' You are already a fool. Now where is that chalk to keep track of time. 'Now let that be a lesson to the lot of ya!' Great! Now's he is screaming at my friends. What's next? No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm? 'No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!' Right as always. He should say something very different besides that old phase…*sigh* BUT YOU'LL SEE MR. TWEEDY! WE WILL ESCAPE![Chapter 2] Chapter 2; A New Bird? This is like my fifth time in solitary confinement which proves that the plan that me and Mac came up with didn't work to which is why I ended up here. And if you're wondering what the plan was, well… the plan was to hide inside farm things. My friends took the chicken feed dish and I took the part of a roof top thing, but sadly my dear friends made too much noise and I got caught by Mr. tweedy once again. I came up with a new plan which is to dress up a Mrs. Tweedy and today. So when I went back to the chicken farm I told my friends the idea. 'Huh?' Wow. Such dumb do-… wait please don't tell me that the dress is ripping apart. No no no please don't not now in our moment of freedom. Damm! It ripped apart and I guess I will say hello to my old friend Solitary Confinement again. - 4 days later - So bored! This old dirty tennis ball is no longer fun. *sigh* when do I get to come out? I'm angry for last time our plan didn't work and i'm really tired of coming back here over and over again. I hear Mr. tweedy footsteps outside as a little door opens up. Looks like I'm going home. Yay…but in a forced way since the douche bag kicked me inside. 'Morning Ginger!' I turn around to see it's my best friend, Babs. 'Back from holiday?' she asks. 'I wasn't in holiday Babs. I was in solitary confinement.\" 'oh. It's nice to get a bit of time to yourself, isn't it?' Huh? Not really, but it gives me time to think of a new plan to bust our selves out of her once and for all. Then I hear bells ringing and I see my dad, Fowler, on the roof giving directions. 'Roll call!' he yells. 'Come along now! You'll be late for parade!' Parade? Wonder where he got that word from. Anyways I can tell he is so busy telling us what to do that he doesn't even remember he is one of us too. 'Pip pip. Quick march. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Come on. Smarten up! Discipline! Order!' He gets off the roof and is now walking in front of us. 'Back in my R. A. F. days when the senior officer called for a scramble, you'd hop in the old crate and tally ho. Chocks away!' 'Give over you old fool. They just want to count us.' Ha-ha. Wow. Fowler and his back in his days are forever making Bunty mad. 'Oh how dare you talk back to a senior ranking officer? Why, back in my R. A. F. days-' Oh no! Here comes Mrs. Tweedy! 'Fowler, they're coming. Back in line.' 'Oh right, right' As they come closer my father whispers to me. 'There will be a stern reprimand for you lad. You're grounded.' Grounded? But why? What did I do wrong this time? 'Attten-tion!' Eek. Creepy. While Mrs. Tweedy is talking Mac leans over. 'Welcome back hen. Is there a new plan?' I tried not to smile and give Mac a paper. 'I thought we tried going under?' Huh? I look over and flipped the paper over. 'Ah! Over. Right!' Ha-ha. Silly Mac. Mrs. Tweedy got a clipboard from Mr. tweedy and I know she is going to check our egg count. I lean over to Bounty and talk to her for a while. 'How's the egg count?' 'I've laid five eggs this morning. Five! Well-chuffed with that, I was-' 'Shush!' Sheesh dad sure is over protective. Then I see why. Mrs. tweedy looks at the egg chart and stops at- 'Oh no! Edwina! Bounty why didn't you give her some yours?' 'I would have. She didn't tell me. She didn't tell anybody.' I was shocked at that and then I knew she was so busy trying to escape like me but why didn't she tell anyone? Then Mrs. Tweedy gets Edwina by the neck and carries her off. 'Oh. Is Edwina off on holiday?' Now that put me into thinking. I go up the roof to get a better view. I regret going to the roof now because what I see is Edwina getting her head chopped off. It's making me cry. We have to get out of this dump and fast. 'Ginger are we still on?' 'Oh we're on, all right. Spread the word Mac. Meeting tonight in hut 17.' I usually have the meetings in the afternoons at hut 16, but this time I felt that I needed more time to think of another plan. This time im going to need more materials which I hope the rats come tonight. - Night time - Knock. Knock. I open the tiny little window of the door and see two chickens which one of them is Babs with her newly knitted pink hat. Right after they come in I hear another knock. I open the tiny window once again and I see it's the rats! Yes they came which means I get to order the materials right away to start on the plan. 'You called? Nick and-' 'Fetcher' 'At your service.' Ha! Such a phony introduction but okay. I see they are trying to be nice to their number one client. I hear the dogs barking and I know I will have to make business with them fast. 'over here… we need some more things-' I began but then they cut me off. 'right you are miss! How about this quality handcrafted tea set?' 'uh no' I say quickly. I don't need anything UNuseful. 'or this lovely necklace and pendant?' 'its lovely-' I get cut off again. 'or this beautiful little number, all the rage in the fashionable chicken coops of paris. Simply pop it on like so and as the French hens say, \"voila\"!' says Nick as he puts the hat on me. 'that's French.' 'that's two hats in one, miss. For parties. For weddings,' he turns the hat over making the long part look like a veil. 'oh, but madame, this makes you look like a vision, like a dream.' 'like a duck.' Nows my chance! 'no thank you. We're making this. We need those things. Can you get them.' Nick takes the paper and looks at it. 'oh, oh, oh. This is a big job miss. Oh bigger than the others. No, no. this is gona cost.' He says like if it is really a big job. 'same as always. One bag of seeds.' I hand him a bag of seeds and he looks at it disappointed. -TO BE CONTUINED-ON CHAPTER 2 OF COURSE-[Chapter 3] Hello this Prince Sparkles, originally known as Cat Freak 101. And I decided to come back after such a looooonnnngggg time to continue on my project. This story, which I still remember, I was Inspired by SRG. And well tada, here I am, back at it again with writing stories. So cheer to more chapters FOR CHICKEN RUN FROM GINGERS VIEW. Chapter 2: A New Bird? Part 2 ON THE LAST PART! (Nows my chance! \"No thank you. We're making this. We need those things. Can you get them?\" Nick takes the paper and looks at it. \"Oh, oh, oh. This is a big job miss. Oh bigger than the others. No, no, this gonna cost.\" He says like if its really a big job. \"Same as always. One bag of seeds.\" I hand him a bag of seeds and he looks at it disappointed.) IN PART 2. \"You call this pay?\" spats out Nick spilling the feed out of the bag with such disgust. What an ungrateful rat. \"Its chicken feed.\" I respond as if reminding him about the contents he is spilling. \"What else could we give you?\" I asked uncertainly as its quite impossible to get them anything else. \"Eggs.\" He replied. \"EGGS?!\" I almost fainted. \"Eggs.\" He repeated calmly and quite greedily. \"We can't give your our eggs. They're too valuable.\" What are they thinking? Apart from escaping, these eggs are our only salvation. \"So are we.\" Nick replies. \"After you Fetcher.\" \"After I what?\" Poor Fetcher was lost in everything. \"Move!\" said Nick impatiently as he pushed Fetcher away. I watched them walk away. These rats are being rats right now because they won't bring what I ask for. Well, I guess that means I'll have to just continue on with the meeting. I look around with my oil lamp, making sure that Mr. tweedy nor his dogs are out on patrol before sneaking back inside in Hut 17. Once inside the warm hut, I find everything out of order and chaos. I slowly walk to Mac and starts slamming my wing against a table. \"Order! Order!\" Ugh, no one is listening to me. \"Quiet everyone!\" Oh what a pain. \"Settle down! I would like to call to order… Oh please!\" I feel overwhelmed not being able to control these hens, but luckily Dad stands up. \"Quiet there!\" All the hens finally started to quiet down. \"Let's have some discipline, what, what?\" \"Thank You!\" Im truly grateful. \"In my RAF days, we had no time for unnecessary chitchat.\" Oh no… Not again. \"Yes, thank you Fowler.\" I say a bit firmly and I believe my dad got the hint. \"I… Right, Carry on.\" Now on with plan. \"Now, I know our last escape attempt was a bit of a fiasco… but Mac and I have come up with a brand new plan! Show them Mac!\" I gestured towards her. \"Right.! We tried going under the wire and that didn't work. So the plan is.. We go over it!\" Mac unwinds the paper I gave her earlier today and puts it up and takes out a contraption that looks like a catapult and a turnip. \"This is us, right?\" She points at the turnip, \"We get in like this\" , she puts the turnip on the little contraption, \"wind her up\" , she winds up a little knob, \"and let her go!\" , and this part I regret. As soon as Mac let go, the turnip went flying and crashing against the wall splattering everywhere, destroyed. It definitely sent all the hens screaming their heads off. Dad sarcastically remarked, \"Good Grief! The turnip bought it!\" Suddenly one of spy hens yelled, \"The farmer's coming!\" We all immediately hid in all the spots and went to our own beds and even placed a fake chicken to fill an empty nest. All just in time as Mr. Tweedy opened our coop by the roof and looked inside with a cold glare and a bright flashlight. He did not let one inch pass by unnoticed. But thankfully Mrs. Tweedy called him, causing him to hit his head with our coop's roof and mumbling something strange as he walked away, rubbing his head. I immediately get out of my hiding place. \"Hmm… think, everyone, think! What haven't we tried yet?\" I said. I looked at everyone as they look at one another. Bounty steps up with an angry look.

And I decided to come back after such a looooonnnngggg time to continue on my project. This story, which I still remember, I was Inspired by SRG. And well tada, here I am, back at it again with writing stories. So cheer to more chapters FOR CHICKEN RUN FROM GINGERS VIEW. Chapter 2: A New Bird? Part 2 ON THE LAST PART! (Nows my chance! \"No thank you. We're making this. We need those things. Can you get them?\" Nick takes the paper and looks at it. \"Oh, oh, oh. This is a big job miss. Oh bigger than the others. No, no, this gonna cost.\" He says like if its really a big job. \"Same as always. One bag of seeds.\" I hand him a bag of seeds and he looks at it disappointed.) IN PART 2. \"You call this pay?\" spats out Nick spilling the feed out of the bag with such disgust. What an ungrateful rat. \"Its chicken feed.\" I respond as if reminding him about the contents he is spilling. \"What else could we give you?\" I asked uncertainly as its quite impossible to get them anything else. \"Eggs.\" He replied. \"EGGS?!\" I almost fainted. \"Eggs.\" He repeated calmly and quite greedily. \"We can't give your our eggs. They're too valuable.\" What are they thinking? Apart from escaping, these eggs are our only salvation. \"So are we.\" Nick replies. \"After you Fetcher.\" \"After I what?\" Poor Fetcher was lost in everything. \"Move!\" said Nick impatiently as he pushed Fetcher away. I watched them walk away. These rats are being rats right now because they won't bring what I ask for. Well, I guess that means I'll have to just continue on with the meeting. I look around with my oil lamp, making sure that Mr. tweedy nor his dogs are out on patrol before sneaking back inside in Hut 17. Once inside the warm hut, I find everything out of order and chaos. I slowly walk to Mac and starts slamming my wing against a table. \"Order! Order!\" Ugh, no one is listening to me. \"Quiet everyone!\" Oh what a pain. \"Settle down!

TherenI said it! Now lets move on. *First of all, I'm ~new~ incase you haven't noticed, but I have written CRnfics before, so hopefully you will see a lot of me! OK, here goesnnothing..* This is just a little story about the chickens when they first got to thenisland... Part ONE!!! * * * * * * * * The plane rose over Ginger's favorite hill. Ginger looked down in amazement at the beautiful green islands. Rockynsmiled, he loved to see her happy. Suddenly, she heard Fowler's voice callndown to her. \"Where do you want me to land?!\", he yelled. \"Oh, um..I'm not sure yet!\", Ginger searched the land frantically, tryingnto pick the best spot to start her flock's new life, \"Right down there,nFowler!\", she hoped that he heard. It was just perfect. The single island, with so many trees. She hadnremembered seeing treetops just over that hill, back on the farm; Shenfigured that was the island she had always dreamed about. The plane roughly landed on a patch of grass. Ginger became very exited allnof a sudden. \"Ok, ladies!\", she sang out, \"We are finally here!!\", she could barelynget the words out without crying, she was so happy. They all started rushing out of the plane (which was ruined), and Gingernstepped out as well. They were all so exited and wanted to explore rightnaway. Rocky pulled her into a tight hug, \"So how does it feel?\", he saidngesturing to her feet which were, for the first time, in grass. \"You'd be surprised, what its like for me\", Ginger said softly, andnsmiled with satisfaction. Rocky and Ginger both walked together to catch up with the others. It wasnearly morning. The sun was just rising. But, nobody was tired, though theynhad all lost a night's worth of sleep. About an hour later, it was clearnthat they had to start planning out their \"living arrangements\" on thenisland. Ginger had sent Fowler, Babs and a few other willing hens to go andnget a good look around. \"Mac?\", Ginger asked, \"Will you make up some plans for our houses? Itndoesn't really have to be all that fancy just yet, but we need to startnsomewhere.\" *(I wont try on Mac's accent, use your imagination)*, Mac nodded, \"Aye,nHen. I even have it all figured out already. That clearing there, near thenstream looks like a good spot to start. I will round up some of the hens,nand get started right away!\", she said cheerfully. \"Bunty, will you look out for and foxes and things like that?\", Gingernasked as she suddenly thought of that problem. \"Already on the job!\", Bunty was already looking for foxholes. Ginger got a few more things in order, and finally decided to make herselfnuseful, too. Using this advantage to take a walk with Rocky. As they walked, they both were kind of nervous. Realizing that they hadnkissed on the plane, and they were now all alone. Rocky tried to make it anlittle more comfortable by actually talking. \"So how is it so far?\", He asked with a smile, \"I mean, you're finallynhere, so, what do you think of it?\" Ginger thought for a minute, trying to find the right words, \"Well, I'venspent my whole life on a farm. Not the same farm.but this is a hell of anlot better!\", she said playfully. Rocky laughed and put his arm around her. He was way too nervous. Hendidn't understand at all. Of course he loved her, but he had never beennnervous around a chick before, ever. As they got to the water edge, Rockynhad been able to catch sight of the lake. \"Damn! This place aint half bad.\" He said with a satisfied tone. They kept walking, and came across the 'Bird Sanctuary' sign, where Nicknand Fetcher had already crossed the word 'bird' out with a red crayon. Itnwas clear that they never learned how to spell chicken. ******************************** Ginger and Rocky had walked back in what seemed like the middle-late partnof the day. Seeing almost finished coops, and a nice little set up in thentheir 'home-area'. \"Wow, that was fast!\", Rocky commented. Ginger noticed that one of the coops was a little smaller than thenothers, \"How come that coop is different?\", she asked Mac softly. Mac replied without much interest, \"Oh, well, we thought that you and Rockynshould have your own coop together.\" Ginger and Rocky both looked at each other and then looked away nervously. ********* ****** ******* ******* ******* *Ok, the next chapter will have more of a plot(there is a point tonthis!really!), and will have more focus on Rocky and Ginger than anythingnelse(surprise!)and it will get more interesting etc....anyway, you can gonahead and tell me what you thinks so far, plz!!!, but if you're a flamer,nthen don't even bother*[Chapter 2] Disclaimer; Don't own Chicken Run etc. I also don't own some ofnRocky/Ginger's life story. *I think it gets more interesting...* * * * ** * * * * * * * **** *** * * * * * * * It was night. All was finally at ease. Home was set up within a dayn and now the chickens could go on with their lives.n At the moment, they were all celebrating their freedom. Theren was a big party and they were all having a lot of fun. They had evenn managed to create a small fire. It had only been a few hours, butn Ginger's memories of the farm were already slipping away. * * * * * * * * * * * * Rocky moved through the crowd, looking for her. \"Hey Ginge!\", he saidn when he finally found her, \"Come here!\" She smiled and walked over to him, \"Is everything OK?\", she askedn suspiciously. Rocky wondered why she thought anything could be wrong, \"Of course,n everything's fine!, But come on, I got somethin' to show ya!\" They walked to a very peaceful and secluded spot somewhere onn the island. \"Wow, it's beautiful.\", Ginger said under her breath. \"I knew that you would like this place\", Rocky put his hand on hern shoulder. He had leaded her to probably the best place on their island.n There was a stream with a small waterfall. Colorful plants everywheren and an opening in the trees to look at the stars. And so they lay onn their backs, really close, playing 'Find the shape in the stars'.n Rocky had to admit that it was fun, although, he wasn't used ton being so *romantic*. Somehow, they had started a conversation aboutn their lives, and what it was like for them growing up. \"..Well my parents are dead\", Ginger said softly, \"They gotn killed. I sure loved them, though. I cant remember them arguing evenn once. I was separated from my Family when I was really young. Taken ton that farm. And for some reason, the chickens there decided that In would make a good leader.\" \"Any brothers or sisters?\" \"Yes, 8 of them\", Ginger answered, \"I really couldn't stand some ofn them.\" \"Really? I had 3 sisters. I got along with them just fine\",n Rocky said with a little smile. Then he mumbled, \"Of course, I usuallyn kept to myself. My mother was the greatest. She really cared aboutn me.\" He finished. \"Well, what about your father?\" He shuttered. Damn! He would have to talk about his Dad. \"I hate my father\", Rocky said, trying to sound casual about it,n \"He got along with my sisters, I guess. But it was a different storyn for me and my mom\" he sighed, \"He hated me, never could figure outn why. He argued with my mom a lot, hit her a few times too...welln anyway, one day, he just left.\", Rocky cringed thinking of the past.n Ginger couldn't believe he'd been through that. Rocky added one more thing, \"I would never be like that with our kids,n though.\" Ginger smiled and looked at him, \"Kids?\" Rocky gulped, realizing he had said that out loud. But at least shen kissed him for it.. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ** ** *OK, to be continued! Go ahead and Review.*[Chapter 3] Disclaimer; I don't own any CR stuff etc.. *Yawn* Ugh! Its time to turn my brain on! I think I forget how!*n*LOL, that was so pointless.* Onward with Chapter 3! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Fowler was the first to realize that Rocky wasn't there. And to hisn dismay, Ginger wasn't there either. He didn't like the idea of themn together. He would have, but he just couldn't trust Rocky. He hadn complained to some of the hens about it. \"Oh, don't pry into their business, Fowler!\", Bunty scolded, \"They can don what they wish\" \"And besides\", Mac cut in, \"they could just be taking a walk for all youn know\" \"Yes, sure\", Fowler mumbled, \"but I still don't trust him.\" \"Why not?\", Babs asked, she didn't get it. \"Because if roosters don't produce eggs then they produce somethingnelse, and.\", Nick cut in annoyingly. \"Hey! None of us need to be discussing that!\", Bunty scowled at him. Fowler used this argument as his chance to sneak off and look for the twon of them.n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Meanwhile.. Ginger and Rocky had been wandering around for the last hour just tonpass time. But Ginger didn't seem to be paying attention to anything aroundnher at all. She seemed really distant. \"Ginge, are you ok?\", Rocky asked cautiously. \"Yeah, I'm fine\", she answered faintly. He could still tell something was bothering her, \"Whater it is, youncan tell me, ya know?\" \"Well.I was thinking.about this hen on the farm. Her name was Edwinanand she got taken to the chop. I just feel bad we didn't save her too.\" Rocky understood all too well about death of friends. He hugged herntight, for the comfort. Before he could say anything to her, he heard anrustle in the bushes. Him and Ginger exchanged a look. \"wh.who's there?\", Ginger called. Just then, something walked out of thenbushes. It was Fowler! Ginger sighed, \"God Fowler, you scared me..\" \"Damn it Fowler! Why are you following us?!\", Rocky was so sick ofnhim. \"I'm just checking up on Ginger.\", Fowler glanced to her. \"What's that supposed to mean?\", Rocky yelled. \"I can take care of myself, Fowler!\", Ginger wanted him to leave. \"Yeah, but with him around, who knows what could happen!\", Fowler justndidn't get it. \"Hey, I ain't like that!\"(full-blown argument between Rocky and Fowler) Ginger rolled her eyes, 'so much for peace and quiet', she thought.nBefore it could turn into a fistfight. Ginger pulled Rocky by his bandana. \"Go count to ten.\", she mumbled. Then she turned to Fowler, \"Younknow, you really are gonna have to get along with him!\" \"Why? I don't trust him!\", Fowler glanced at Rocky who was walking bynthe lake. \"I'll decide that. You don't have to be friends with him but-be nice! Hendidn't do anything to you\", Ginger said, the on a second though, \"and I canndo what I want anyway! So will you leave us alone?\" Fowler stalked off. Not satisfied at all. Ginger walked over to Rocky, \"I would've beaten him, ya know.\" he said. \"Of course you would have\", she said truthfully. \"What's his problem anyway? I mean you trust me don't you\" \"Yes! Why wouldn't I?\", she hugged him, trying to get his mind offnit.n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *I am gonna stop there cuz I just fell back in my chair. (brain damage).

You were seven, Missy was seven, and Cliff was eight. Your parents became fast friends which pushed the three of you together. You bonded easily with Missy. She wasn't quite as girly as you were, but she contrasted you in a good way. She's the one that taught you were the word \"idiot\", in reference to her brother Cliff, who you were shy around. You weren't interested in boys yet; you were too young. You and Missy were in the same class for the second half of second grade. But when the two of you entered third grade, you were put in different homerooms. You made a pact that first day during recess. \"A pact's like a promise, right?\" Missy asked you. You had just learned the word and were very proud of yourself for knowing a word Missy didn't. \"Yep,\" you said. And you beamed at her. You were reveling in your own pride. \"Okay.\" \"Okay. Let's make a pact.\" You put out your hand and her small hand joined firmly with yours. \"Promise we'll always tell each other everything. And it has to be the truth.\" \"Sure thing, Tore,\" she said. You hugged her. Her little arms wrapped around your waist and held you. Even then, you knew that the two of you would be friends forever. And you were right. Because sure enough nine years later, you find her tapping on your window with a black eye. You smile a little; that's your Missy -- then you run to the window and open it. \"Missy, get in here!\" You grab her hands and help her into your bedroom. \"What happened?\" She sighs and collapses on your bed. \"The black's from Cliff. I got a little mad at him for...breaking up with you. He's a freaking moron.\" You sigh. That's Missy. She's so beat up and she's clutching at her forehead. You crawl onto the bed next to her. \"You didn't deserve that. You've been dating him for nearly a year.\" \"I love that you care so much about me, Miss. But Cliff had every right to break up with me. Especially after what I told him,\" you say quietly. She turns on her side, wincing as she does, and meets your eyes. \"I told him that...I was a lesbian.\" Missy nods and is still for a few moments as she registers what you have said. You smile fondly at the appearance of the familiar silence. Finally, she speaks. \"Are you?\" You sigh and shrug. \"I don't know. I'm just...I'm not attracted to Cliff. I mean, he's cute and all, but there's just nothing there. And I look at guys and I feel nothing.\" \"Do you feel anything when you look at girls?\" she asks softly. You feel your heart jump in your chest when she looks at you. \"One girl,\" you reply, rolling onto your back. \"You might know her.\" Your heart is pounding so hard that you swear it's going to fly out of your chest. You can hardly believe that you're telling her this. But she slowly nods her head. \"I 'might' know her, huh?\" she asks. You nod as she scoots closer to you. You like this. You have always liked this. She puts a hand on your belly and you shiver when you feel her fingers creep over your skin. \"What's she look like?\" \"She's amazingly beautiful,\" you whisper. \"Dark brown hair, dark eyes, the cutest dimples...strong, loving, someone who would defend their friends.\" Missy nods. \"You're right,\" she says. \"I think I do know this girl. And I think she'd be lucky to have you and glad to know that you like her. Cause I think she told me she likes you back.\" \"Did she now?\" Missy nods. \"Well, if I tried to kiss her, what would she do?\" You move on top of her, straddling her hips and looking down into her dark eyes. She looks straight back up to you and she doesn't even have to answer the question out loud. You know what it would be. You lean in and press your lip firmly against hers. \"Always gotta honor the pact,\" she gasps, a few minutes later when the two of you break apart. You smile and gently press against her black eye. A bit of it comes off on your finger. You frown and show it to her. She lets out a weak chuckle and sits up slowly. You climb off her and glare at her, waiting for an explanation. \"About that...\" \"Looks like you didn't 'honor the pact',\" you say. Missy looks a little scared. \"Why'd you do it?\" \"Cause I love you. And I didn't know you loved me back. So I guess I thought this would win me sympathy points. It was supposed to make it easier for me to do what you got to first.\" You shake your head. \"Missy, I love you. You don't need a fake black eye to get that. Just stick to the pact.\" You lean in and kiss her softly. \"Now go wash that stuff off your face. I wanna have a movie night all cuddled up with my new girlfriend.\" Missy looks surprised when you say \"girlfriend\", but it quickly becomes a look of happiness as she leans in and presses her lips to yours. She pulls back and you find yourself wanting to yank her in for another kiss and take back what you said about washing off the make-up. You just want to be in her arms and kissing her. She smiles. \"Be back in a minute.\" And true to her word, she comes back from the bathroom all cleaned up and ready to cuddle. You turn off the lights and pop in the movie you chose while she was in the bathroom. It's the only movie that makes Missy cry: Old Yeller . Her strong arms wrap around your waist and she kisses the top of your head. You rest your head against her shoulder. \"I love you,\" you whisper. The dimpled smile you receive makes your heart melt. As the previews on the old videocassette roll, she leans down and kisses you deeply. You know this isn't going to be a normal movie night, but it doesn't matter. You're in the arms of the woman you love, and that's what matters. The End.","LastChapter":"The Pact You remember when the Pantones moved to town.

I mean, he's cute and all, but there's just nothing there. And I look at guys and I feel nothing.\" \"Do you feel anything when you look at girls?\" she asks softly. You feel your heart jump in your chest when she looks at you. \"One girl,\" you reply, rolling onto your back. \"You might know her.\" Your heart is pounding so hard that you swear it's going to fly out of your chest. You can hardly believe that you're telling her this. But she slowly nods her head. \"I 'might' know her, huh?\" she asks. You nod as she scoots closer to you. You like this. You have always liked this. She puts a hand on your belly and you shiver when you feel her fingers creep over your skin. \"What's she look like?\" \"She's amazingly beautiful,\" you whisper. \"Dark brown hair, dark eyes, the cutest dimples...strong, loving, someone who would defend their friends.\" Missy nods. \"You're right,\" she says. \"I think I do know this girl. And I think she'd be lucky to have you and glad to know that you like her. Cause I think she told me she likes you back.\" \"Did she now?\" Missy nods. \"Well, if I tried to kiss her, what would she do?\" You move on top of her, straddling her hips and looking down into her dark eyes. She looks straight back up to you and she doesn't even have to answer the question out loud. You know what it would be. You lean in and press your lip firmly against hers. \"Always gotta honor the pact,\" she gasps, a few minutes later when the two of you break apart. You smile and gently press against her black eye. A bit of it comes off on your finger. You frown and show it to her. She lets out a weak chuckle and sits up slowly. You climb off her and glare at her, waiting for an explanation. \"About that...\" \"Looks like you didn't 'honor the pact',\" you say. Missy looks a little scared. \"Why'd you do it?\" \"Cause I love you. And I didn't know you loved me back. So I guess I thought this would win me sympathy points. It was supposed to make it easier for me to do what you got to first.\" You shake your head. \"Missy, I love you. You don't need a fake black eye to get that. Just stick to the pact.\" You lean in and kiss her softly. \"Now go wash that stuff off your face. I wanna have a movie night all cuddled up with my new girlfriend.\" Missy looks surprised when you say \"girlfriend\", but it quickly becomes a look of happiness as she leans in and presses her lips to yours. She pulls back and you find yourself wanting to yank her in for another kiss and take back what you said about washing off the make-up. You just want to be in her arms and kissing her. She smiles. \"Be back in a minute.\" And true to her word, she comes back from the bathroom all cleaned up and ready to cuddle. You turn off the lights and pop in the movie you chose while she was in the bathroom. It's the only movie that makes Missy cry: Old Yeller . Her strong arms wrap around your waist and she kisses the top of your head. You rest your head against her shoulder. \"I love you,\" you whisper. The dimpled smile you receive makes your heart melt. As the previews on the old videocassette roll, she leans down and kisses you deeply. You know this isn't going to be a normal movie night, but it doesn't matter. You're in the arms of the woman you love, and that's what matters. The End.","Summary":" The Pact You remember when the Pantones moved to town.

Feeling a little embarrassed, he turned to give them all a 'Excuse me! I need to handle some business with my woman! So back up!' look. He new that she wasn't officially his, but he knew in his heart that he wanted to be hers. He could tell from whenever they were together that she wanted to be with him just as much.

Oh yeah, he was pissed! \"The closer I got you the less important it all seemed.\" This was coming from her heart. Nothing else mattered now, not her old PV squad, not Brad, not even the competition if she didn't have a chance with Jesse. She knew that and just needed him to know as well. \"So what's important to you now?\" He was having a hard time maintaining his hard façade, because he was becoming lost in her big beautiful green eyes. Her lips were so sexy and inviting. He just wanted to cut the small talk, gently cup her gorgeous face and kiss her with all of the feeling and attraction he's had growing for her ever since the day they met in the hallway. As she looked up at him and considered his question, she thought back to their \"krump session\" in the gym. She chuckled on the inside, because it was more like a \"bump and grind\" session. After that moment, she couldn't deny the chemistry between her and Jesse. She looked down at the collar of his shirt and grinned impishly back up at him as an idea popped in her head. \"I can show you better than I can tell you.\" From the look on her face and her sly comment, he knew she was up to something. Before he could give it another thought, he felt her hands hit his strong chest and grab his shirt. He looked down at her hands and looked back up to search her face; he was all confused, amused and turned on. Her face held an angry, yet playful expression that he couldn't quite discern.

Jan was semi-curled up in the passenger's seat, mumbling drunkenly in his sleep. He'd had a few too man drinks at the party. Les pulled into his driveway, cutting the lights and leaning back for a few moments, musing at how innocent Jan looked when he was sleeping. \"Now, how am I going to get you inside?\" Les asked his fellow squad member and best friend. The other boy, of course, didn't supply an answer. Les couldn't fit any meaning to Jan's drowsy, drunken murmurs. Why'd Jan have to get so drunk? Sure, Big Red's parties were wild, but Jan usually showed more self-control. \"Jan, buddy, wake up.\" Les prodded Jan. Jan stirred, looking as if he would just roll over awkwardly in the seat and continue sleeping. Surprisingly, he opened his slightly blood-shot eyes after a few moments and looked at his friend. His firms lips parted to form a goofy grin. \"Les,\" he mumbled. Les smiled a little. He got out of the car and went around to the other side to help the other boy out of the vehicle. Supporting Jan's muscular body wasn't terribly hard work. Certainly less exerting than some of the tosses in some of Torrance's routines. Half-guiding, half-carrying the dark-haired boy, Les soon had the both of them safely inside the house. After Jan ran into the lamp, which he promptly made a slurred shushing noise at, they were in Les' room. \"All right. You take the bed, I'll take the floor.\" Jan didn't need much encouragement. He promptly and gracelessly passed out on top of the bed, face managing to hit a fluffy pillow. After Les pulled a pillow off the chair in the corner of the room, he stretched out on the floor and tried to sleep. Darn, the floor was cold. Cold and hard. Cold and hard and uncomfortable. Les would never get any sleep like this. He eyed the bed with caution before getting up and stretching tentatively out on the side his friend wasn't occupying, keeping a layer of space between them for the other boy's sake. Moments after his head had hit the pillow, he was asleep. - Les woke up to the still darkness of very early morning. There was a muscular arm draped over his waist. His first reaction was to snuggle back against the owner of that arm. His second reaction was to remember it was Jan in the bed with him. He fought the urge to bolt upright. Though the urge was strong, he was able to suppress it after only a moment's struggle. Jan had only moved in his sleep. It was just a coincidence. They'd already discussed that Jan wasn't interested in that kind of relationship. Even if they hadn't talked about it, there was the way he acted with Courtney. Les didn't move a muscle as he once again closed his eyes. Just because it was an accident didn't mean he couldn't enjoy it. He though of every time he'd fantasized about such physical closeness with his friend. There was something about the strong arm curled around his body and knowing who that arm belonged to. It felt better than Les had imagined it would. He felt so warm and protected that there was no choice but to go back to sleep. - The next time Les woke up there was sunlight shining brightly through the window. He was very aware of the arm still draped over his body. After a few moments, he was also aware of something rather hard pressed against his backside. This time, he didn't resist when his brain told his body to jump out of the bed. \"Wha...?\" Jan drawled lazily, jostled awake by Les' sudden movements. \"Morning!\" Les almost shouted, trying to not look flustered. \"Morning. Ouch, my head...\" Jan's voice took on a slightly whiny quality as he sat up, hand clamped to his brow. \"What happened last night?\" \"You had a few beers and fooled around with Courtney until she passed out. Then I brought you here and had my wicked way with you.\" \"...What?\" Jan was dazed and confused. \"Just kidding about that last part.\" \"Oh.\" Jan wrapped his arms around a pillow and Les thought back to the night before, flushing slightly. Jan didn't seem to notice as he stumbled into the conveniently adjoining bathroom. Les turned the radio on and flopped over on the bed, hearing the sound of water rushing. Jan must have wanted a shower. Jan in the shower was something Les probably shouldn't have been thinking about. Of course, the idea all but consumed him. It was hard to concentrate on anything else with only a single wall between himself and his very naked friend. After a moment of lying there with his face buried in blankets, Les decided he was thirsty. He went and got a drink from the fridge and opened it. Taking a wrong step, he tripped over one of Jan's clumsily discarded shoes. He landed with a resounding thump. His drink, a rather large glass of orange juice, went down with him. The sticky liquid poured all over the white T-shirt and khaki pants he hadn't changed out of last night. He needed a second to himself after that. It was at least that before he was able to do more than groan at his clumsiness. \"Damn.\" He wiped at the giant stain that had formed down the front of his shirt, his hands getting just as sticky as the rest of him. He looked at the bathroom door. Any excuse was a good excuse. He pulled off the now stained shirt and carried it to his bedroom. He went over and knocked on the bathroom door. \"Can I come in and use the sink to clean up?\" \"Whatever, man.\" Les entered, closing the door behind him. He threw his messy shirt in the laundry hamper that occupied a corner of the room. A cloud of steam hung in the air. Jan was humming cheerfully in the glass-walled shower. To Les' slight disappointment, the steam had done a good job at fogging up the glass and hiding Jan from view. Les went to the sink, going about making himself less sticky. After a couple minutes, the shower turned off. Jan's arm stuck out and grabbed a towel. He walked out of the shower with it, surprising Les by using it to dry his hair before wrapping it around his waist. Even modestly covered, Jan's bare torso was still a sight worth seeing. \"Thanks for letting me stay over and everything. My parents would have murdered me.\" \"No problem. My mom won't be back from her business trip until Wednesday.\" Jan left the bathroom then, grinning after giving his friend an affectionate pat on the bottom. Les blushed, following the other boy out to the other room. \"You can stay as long as you like. With exams over and no studying to do, it'll just be boring and quiet.\" Jan nodded, digging through Les' drawers for something to wear. He was in the second highest dresser drawer when he smirked a wide, silly smirk before pulling something out with his thumb and forefinger. Les turned red at the sight of it. \"Les, why do you have a thong?\" Les shrugged, trying to look nonchalant, \"Why not?\" Jan grinned that goofy grin of his, the one he used to freely that made Les want to melt. He dropped his towel without a hint of embarrassment. The scrap of black material was pulled up his legs and snugly over his hips. He turned around, still grinning. \"How do I look?\" Les opened his mouth to respond. Then he closed it. Both actions were repeated a couple times before he finally decided on the open-mouthed option. \"Cat got your tongue?\" Les could swear the other boy's voice sounded huskier than before. With his mouth still wide open, he turned away. At that moment, certain parts of his male anatomy couldn't be trusted. He made a serious effort to close his mouth. Suddenly feeling shy, he looked at Jan with pursed lips. \"You shouldn't tease me so much. You being you, and me being me.\" \"Oh, my god.\" Jan grinned. His next words were said in his best impression of a British accent, \"Do I make you randy, Baby?\" Les couldn't stop himself from bursting out laughing. After Jan didn't join in, he looked up to find the raven-haired cheerleader looking slightly crestfallen. Les thought he would melt. \"Awww, Jan. I didn't mean anything. It's just. Well, you've never exactly been interested. That one time back in freshmen year, you freaked on me, man.\" Les remembered that day shortly after they'd started the ninth grade. Les had been feeling especially bold and had given Jan a surprise kiss. Jan had jumped off the couch faster than seemed humanly possible. Popcorn had spilled all over the room. Jan hadn't even paused before he ran out of the room as fast as his legs would carry him. Jan looked like a great battle was being fought out in his head. Tentatively, he mumbled something Les didn't understand. \"What?\" Les walked a few steps closer. \"I was only keeping up appearances. I'm wasn't as comfortable with it as you are. I'm still not.\" \"So you're saying what, exactly?\" Les' voice cracked and he kicked himself for being so nervous. It was Jan, after all. They'd been friends since forever. \"I'm saying.\" Jan stepped closer, sliding his arms around Les' waist, \"I'm saying that I feel the same way about you that I know you feel about me.\" Les swallowed dryly, looking into Jan's eyes and seeing the sincerity there. He blushed a little and looked down, enjoying the warm breath on his cheek. When he looked back up again, Jan leaned in close for a kiss. Les kissed back, a soft groan escaping his lips. How many times had he thought about this? Jan slid his hands aggressively down Les' back, clamping them lightly on the other boy's behind. The two found their way over to the bed. After a some rather gratuitous smoochies, they fell asleep snuggled against one other.","LastChapter":"Les sighed, driving towards his house with as much alertness he could muster at three in the morning. Jan was semi-curled up in the passenger's seat, mumbling drunkenly in his sleep. He'd had a few too man drinks at the party. Les pulled into his driveway, cutting the lights and leaning back for a few moments, musing at how innocent Jan looked when he was sleeping. \"Now, how am I going to get you inside?\" Les asked his fellow squad member and best friend. The other boy, of course, didn't supply an answer. Les couldn't fit any meaning to Jan's drowsy, drunken murmurs. Why'd Jan have to get so drunk? Sure, Big Red's parties were wild, but Jan usually showed more self-control. \"Jan, buddy, wake up.\" Les prodded Jan. Jan stirred, looking as if he would just roll over awkwardly in the seat and continue sleeping. Surprisingly, he opened his slightly blood-shot eyes after a few moments and looked at his friend. His firms lips parted to form a goofy grin. \"Les,\" he mumbled. Les smiled a little. He got out of the car and went around to the other side to help the other boy out of the vehicle. Supporting Jan's muscular body wasn't terribly hard work. Certainly less exerting than some of the tosses in some of Torrance's routines. Half-guiding, half-carrying the dark-haired boy, Les soon had the both of them safely inside the house. After Jan ran into the lamp, which he promptly made a slurred shushing noise at, they were in Les' room. \"All right. You take the bed, I'll take the floor.\" Jan didn't need much encouragement. He promptly and gracelessly passed out on top of the bed, face managing to hit a fluffy pillow. After Les pulled a pillow off the chair in the corner of the room, he stretched out on the floor and tried to sleep. Darn, the floor was cold. Cold and hard. Cold and hard and uncomfortable. Les would never get any sleep like this. He eyed the bed with caution before getting up and stretching tentatively out on the side his friend wasn't occupying, keeping a layer of space between them for the other boy's sake. Moments after his head had hit the pillow, he was asleep. - Les woke up to the still darkness of very early morning. There was a muscular arm draped over his waist. His first reaction was to snuggle back against the owner of that arm. His second reaction was to remember it was Jan in the bed with him. He fought the urge to bolt upright. Though the urge was strong, he was able to suppress it after only a moment's struggle. Jan had only moved in his sleep. It was just a coincidence. They'd already discussed that Jan wasn't interested in that kind of relationship. Even if they hadn't talked about it, there was the way he acted with Courtney. Les didn't move a muscle as he once again closed his eyes. Just because it was an accident didn't mean he couldn't enjoy it. He though of every time he'd fantasized about such physical closeness with his friend. There was something about the strong arm curled around his body and knowing who that arm belonged to. It felt better than Les had imagined it would. He felt so warm and protected that there was no choice but to go back to sleep. - The next time Les woke up there was sunlight shining brightly through the window. He was very aware of the arm still draped over his body. After a few moments, he was also aware of something rather hard pressed against his backside. This time, he didn't resist when his brain told his body to jump out of the bed. \"Wha...?\" Jan drawled lazily, jostled awake by Les' sudden movements. \"Morning!\" Les almost shouted, trying to not look flustered. \"Morning. Ouch, my head...\" Jan's voice took on a slightly whiny quality as he sat up, hand clamped to his brow. \"What happened last night?\" \"You had a few beers and fooled around with Courtney until she passed out. Then I brought you here and had my wicked way with you.\" \"...What?\" Jan was dazed and confused. \"Just kidding about that last part.\" \"Oh.\" Jan wrapped his arms around a pillow and Les thought back to the night before, flushing slightly. Jan didn't seem to notice as he stumbled into the conveniently adjoining bathroom. Les turned the radio on and flopped over on the bed, hearing the sound of water rushing. Jan must have wanted a shower. Jan in the shower was something Les probably shouldn't have been thinking about. Of course, the idea all but consumed him. It was hard to concentrate on anything else with only a single wall between himself and his very naked friend. After a moment of lying there with his face buried in blankets, Les decided he was thirsty. He went and got a drink from the fridge and opened it. Taking a wrong step, he tripped over one of Jan's clumsily discarded shoes. He landed with a resounding thump. His drink, a rather large glass of orange juice, went down with him. The sticky liquid poured all over the white T-shirt and khaki pants he hadn't changed out of last night. He needed a second to himself after that. It was at least that before he was able to do more than groan at his clumsiness. \"Damn.\" He wiped at the giant stain that had formed down the front of his shirt, his hands getting just as sticky as the rest of him. He looked at the bathroom door. Any excuse was a good excuse. He pulled off the now stained shirt and carried it to his bedroom. He went over and knocked on the bathroom door. \"Can I come in and use the sink to clean up?\" \"Whatever, man.\" Les entered, closing the door behind him. He threw his messy shirt in the laundry hamper that occupied a corner of the room. A cloud of steam hung in the air. Jan was humming cheerfully in the glass-walled shower.

Right there on the beach of Florida. It was amazing! The sun was beginning to set, Jan and Les had started a fire, which wasn't too big because they sucked at making one. But it was very sweet of them. Later on we invited the Clover girls to come and party with us, some agreed, but some still had something up their asses that they felt they were too good for us. Isis, the captain, however did come with a couple of her friends. But then again, we did have free booze. Anyway, it was one of the most best days of my life. Cliff finally made up with Torrance and they lay continuously smooching each other on the sand next to the fire. One of the clover guys had brought a radio and blasted some sort of hip-hop out of the speakers. Isis and her friends began to dance, I just watched. After a few minutes one of the girls made me dance with them, okay, it wasn't my style, so what? I had fun. The next day we all flew home and I reminded myself again why I didn't like being home sometimes. Missy opened the front door of her home and walked in. \"Hello!\" Cliff desperately called out in the house. Figures, Missy thought, no parents in sight and a flashing light on the voicemail. Missy walked to the device and pushed the button. \"Hi, it's Mom, the trip got a little extended so your father and me be out here for maybe a week more. There's money on the fridge if you need some. Love you, bye.\" Missy smirked from the message. \"They didn't even ask if I won a damn thing.\" She said to her brother whom walked into the kitchen. \"Well you know them, pretty busy.\" Cliff grabbed an apple from the fruit basket and started throwing it from his right hand to his left and back. Missy sighed and walked to the fridge. \"Two hundred bucks.\" She counted the dollars. \"Probably think we eat like the salvation army.\" \"Hey!\" Cliff yelled at her and continued sarcastic. \"Don't mock the homeless.\" \"Well sorry,\" She sarcastically shot back. \"But they give me two h-\" Missy paused for a second and then faced Cliff with a broad smile. \"We could call some friends to come over for pizza tonight.\" She said on a singing tone. Cliff agreed and couldn't wait to have Torrance back in his room again. An evil grin appeared on his face. Missy, not noticing his grin, had already grabbed the phone and dialled the number of her captain. Later that night, Missy and Cliff were accompanied by Torrance, Les, Kasey, Darcy and Jan. Courtney and Whitney weren't invited of course, they were über-bitches as Missy put it. Couches were moved and pillows were taken from upstairs. \"Okay,\" Jan walked into the living room holding seven boxes of pizza's. \"Who wanted the cheese & onion?\" Kasey and Darcy yelled and Jan handed their pizza's. \"Pepperoni?\" Torrance already stood up to meet her pizza halfway. \"Hawaii?\" Torrance made a squeak that this was Cliff's and grabbed that one too. \"Dude,\" Les stood up. \"I've got the same.\" Jan handed Les also an Hawaii pizza. \"That leaves these two,\" Jan sat down between Kasey and Missy. \"Chilli pizza for Missy and one for Jan.\" \"Oh, I love fast food.\" Missy gasped opening her pizza box and sitting up against the armrest which began poking in her side. \"Mom and dad never let us eat this!\" \"Uh-huh.\" Cliff agreed with his mouth full and with a piece of cheese dangling from his lips. \"Ah! Gross Cliff!\" Torrance whipped up the cheese and took a bite from her own pizza. Jan put his arms over the back of the couch, behind the heads of Missy and Kasey besides him. \"How're you supposed to eat any pizza?\" Kasey asked Jan. \"With my mouth,\" Jan answered neutral. \"But,\" Kasey pointed at the box on his lap, which was miles away from his mouth. \"You can't reach that.\" \"I hoped you, as my slaves, would feed me like ancient Greeks.\" Jan smiled broad as Missy and Kasey's faces twitched in disgust. \"Gross Jan!\" Missy slammed her elbow right in his ribs what made him gasp for air and sitting up straight again. \"Who's in for the movie?\" Les suggested and stood up to put the DVD in. There were some yells muffled by pizza and Les put the DVD on play. There they were, just like in Los Angeles for Cliff and Missy, together with their friends on the couch watching a movie. Jan, Missy, Darcy and Kasey were on the couch, while Cliff and Torrance were sitting happily together on the floor with Les on the other side. The next few hour and a half were filled by screams of the horror movie Jan and Les had picked out that afternoon. After the first movie a comedy followed. And after the pizza's the drinks followed. Jan had taken beer from home, while Les had brought wine (Typically Les, as Darcy muttered under her breath) and Missy and Cliff had their share from the 'secret' alcohol cabinet their father had in the kitchen. He would never notice it since he only filled it and no bottle had ever left the cabinet. Kasey made her first encounter with some kind of red drink, Cliff claimed it was some sort of Vodka drink, and fell in love with one of the cushions with which she peacefully fell asleep. Darcy became a little tipsy from the wine and began laughing very much. Les, whom had taken them to Missy and Cliff's house, stayed sober (after one glass of wine and three juices) for the girls so he could take them home. Torrance was a little far gone from the beer and was snuggled into Cliff's shoulder. Missy and Jan however, those guys didn't seem to have any flaw from the alcohol. They had grabbed the Xbox consoles and had been playing a race game against each other. \"I'm so gonna be ahead of you,\" Missy muttered sitting straight up with both feet on the couch under her. \"No you're not.\" Jan answered, his eyes fixed on the screen before them. At the end of the game Jan won. \"You cheated!\" Missy tried. But Jan shook his head. \"I'm just better.\" Les turned and grabbed the console from Missy and began playing against Jan. \"Let the male ego's fight each other, perfect idea.\" Cliff said sarcastic. \"Oh shut up man.\" Missy shut her brother up watching the screen closely. This time Les won and let Jan behind with his mouth fallen open by amazement. \"Oh man, you lost from a fag.\" Missy said laughing. \"There goes my manliness…\" Jan pouts at the screen while Missy gives him a comforting pat on the back. \"If it is any comforting,… there wasn't very much left of it even when you began the race.\" Missy started laughing very hard and took another zip from her fifth beer. Jan took one too, except he was at his seventh beer. While looking at the screen he said to Missy: \"Rumble? With dead or alive?\" \"I'm in.\" Missy said. \"Yeah, he will play against a girl, 'cuz it's the only way he can win.\" Les teased him while looking on his watch. It was two o'clock. \"I thing I'll be taking the girls home.\" Les began and stood up. Darcy woke Kasey and helped her off the couch. \"Bye man,\" Les said giving the now standing Jan a handshake they always did, with shoulder and all. \"See you around.\" Jan greeted him. Torrance was woken too and helped up by Cliff. She could just say goodnight to the girls and Les before they went to the front door. \"Bye, thanks for the company.\" Missy said to them as they went outside. They saw them stepping into the vehicle and Les started the engine. After checking the girls were on tight he waved at the audience at the door and drove away. \"Well that's that,\" Cliff spoke and closed the door. \"We're going to bed.\" \"Yeah, I-,\" Torrance was caught off guard by a sudden yawn. \"I'm tired.\" Missy frowned. \"We can see that,\" She smiled. \"I'll see you guys tomorrow.\" Cliff and Torrance disappeared up the stairs. \"What should we do now?\" Jan asked. \"I'm SO not tired right now.\" Missy pulled up her shoulders. \"I don't know.\" At that moment she heard a sound coming from upstairs. It sounded like her cell phone. \"Missy, your phone.\" Cliff yelled from upstairs. While she heard it she sprinted upstairs and saw that she had two messages. Reading them, she returned back downstairs. \"What's up?\" Jan asked. \"There's this friend from L.A. who sent me a message, Holly is her name, she asks me if I still want to come to the performance of Meadtown.\" While looking up she saw Jan's puzzled face. \"It's a local rock band in L.A.\" She quickly explained. \"Holly can get me in quick and free.\" \"What kind of a rock band is it?\" Jan asked. \"Well, all sorts, they have two female singer and one male, they play from soft rock to…, have you ever heard hard rock?\" Missy doubted that he has and perhaps he doesn't even want to go. \"Well, I once got a cd from a friend and I love it, but I don't know what is you're talking about.\" Jan told her. Missy frowned. \"What was the band's name?\" \"Something with Roach… aw, I can't remember.\" Jan told her. Missy had one eyebrow raised. \"Papa roach!\" Missy quickly says in recognition and Jan nodded. \"This band plays a little from them, and other covers like that, but also original numbers.\" Jan's eyes widened and he smiled. \"Then I'd love to go.\" Jan said smiling. \"I'll call her right now.\" Missy dialled a number and held the phone to her ear. \"Hey Holly, It's Missy, What?... Oh yeah, where?... okay, 'till how long? Hold on.\" Missy took the phone off her ear. \"It's until five in the morning, have a problem with that?\" Jan shook his head. \"I have absolutely no life.\" He chuckled. Missy smirked and went back to her phone. \"Okay, yeah, it's okay, … see you in a half an hour.\" Missy hung up. \"Isn't L.A. like an hour driving?\" Jan asked. \"I guess, but we're going fifteen minutes driving from here.\" Missy walked up the stairs to Cliff's room. \"Cliff?\" She knocked on the door and the boy opened. \"We're going out okay?\" \"Where are you going?\" Cliff asks sleepy. \"To Root's, Holly's there.\" Cliff nodded. \"Okay, when're you back?\" \"Probably round six, or later.\" Missy told his brother and said goodnight. After this she turned around and saw Jan approaching her. \"I'll be just quick changing this shirt.\" Missy disappeared once again, but now into her room. She exited once again with a glittering black top and a very low v-neck. You could now notice she had a gold chain around her neck. Jan raised his eye brow at her appearance. \"Jan? Are you coming?\" She asked and he followed her like a loyal puppy. Everything for a beautiful lady. They decided to take Jan's jeep, it was after all bigger than Missy's. With Missy giving him direction, they found their way to Root's. Lying in some industrial area, it looked like some kind of unknown bunker. Missy had been there before, lots of times when she was a bit younger. Jan had already asked how they could get in while they weren't even 21. That's where Holly came in, Missy told him, she had always gotten her and friends into almost any bar where they asked for ID's. Holly seemed to had a good eye for the bouncers. Or just great legs. Jan parked the jeep next to a row of cars in the grass and they got out of the vehicle. When they got near the entrance a blond girl approached them. \"Missy,\" The girl with blond curly hair approached the female cheerleader and hugged her tight. \"Haven't seen you in months, how are you?\" \"Great, you?\" Missy asked being as enthusiastic as the girl. \"Good, and who's this?\" The girl quickly turned to Jan. \"I'm Jan.\" He held out his hand and she shook it. Jan couldn't help but check out Holly's body. She had long perfect legs which were half covered by a long velvet skirt. Two plackets showed her bare legs at the sides, her hips were almost shown. Holly's top was also tight and also black, with long sleeves. \"Ah, boyfriend ey? I'm Holly, I'll get you in quick and free.\" The girl said quick and turned, but she was held back by Jan's voice. \"We aren't…\" He trailed off after seeing Holly had gotten the message. \"Never were.\" \"Oh, sorry, I assumed,\" The blonde apologized. \"You Missy, with a guy, together. Anyway, I'll get you in.\" She turned quickly and walked to the entrance. A big bouncer caught their attention. \"It's cool Carey, they're with me.\" Holly said and the bouncer let them through. Inside the hard sound of guitars and drums filled their ears. Holly leapt towards them again. \"Me, Ginger and Kim are over there, you can sit with us for drinks.\" Holly screamed over the music. Jan offered to get some drinks and Missy walked with Holly over to the table. \"Missy!\" Ginger and Kim yelled together. Missy was crushed into a hug between the two girls. \"Who's the guy?\" \"Ow, his name's Jan.\" Missy told the girls. \"He's jummy.\" Ginger said and Missy laughed. \"Is he yours?\" \"Nope.\" Missy said. The girls frowned. \"Why not?\" \"Well, he's one of my best friends, no chemistry there.\" She yelled into Kim's ear. \"Can I have him?\" Ginger asked. \"That's what you have to sort out with Kim.\" Missy told her and Jan came tot the table with three beers and two glasses of Bacardi coke. \"Come one, let's dance.\" Jan asked Missy and pulled her to dance. Missy didn't know what happened to her. Within seconds they were dancing close together to the rhythm of 'I can dream' originally from Skunk Anansie. Jan was such a good dancer. He grabbed her when she went too far away from him and let her go on the right moments when Missy needed some space to get wild. The moment she was getting so into him and his dancing, a quick number was played and Jan let go of her. Missy saw Ginger approach and take hold of Jan before she could. A guy behind her began dancing with her and Missy didn't mind, … at first. The more the night proceeded, the more Jan danced with Kim or Ginger. And the more Missy got the urge to take him back violently, like he shouldn't dance with them. He shouldn't, they were kind of man eaters. They would sleep with them, tell all people in their environment they were terrible and then dump them by claiming they deserve better. That's just how they are, and that's not how Jan is! Well … not exactly. But he just shouldn't be dancing with them! What the hell! Missy called herself back to reality, he can dance with who ever he wants! At five o'clock the performance was over and Kim and Ginger wrote their names and numbers on a paper that Jan took with him. They told him he should call them sometimes. Missy got more pissed every second, she felt like beating the crap out of those two sluts. After saying goodbye she quickly dragged Jan to his jeep and made him open the door. \"That was a fun evening,\" Jan said and heard something grumping next to him. \"What did you say Missy?\" \"Nothing, I think I have a headache.\" She said and rubbed her head. Maybe she would feel better if she got some fresh air. Missy tilted her head and took a deep whiff of air, walking a bit away from the vehicle. At that moment she felt all the beers and noticed she was really drunk. She usually felt this when she was slowing down on the evening with too much alcohol still in her veins. The world began turning a bit and the next thing she knew she was looking at her own vomit in the grass. \"Are you okay?\" Jan shouted from the car. Missy got up quick and walked back to the car. \"I ate pizza.\" She said wiping her mouth. Jan handed her a bottle of water he kept in his car. \"Here drink this, it will clear your mouth.\" She drank some and her mouth was washed from the vomit. She looked back at the car and she saw he was putting the back seats down. \"What are you doing?\" She asked putting the bottle back. \"We can't drive like this, we'll spend the night here and I'll take you home tomorrow, if you slept off your hangover.\" He told her while laying some blankets on the now flat baggage space. Missy gave up and laid down on them, Jan next to her and putting the trunk door down. Okay, it was bigger than her beetle, but they still had to curl up together a bit, also to keep warm. Jan put the blanket over them and looked at her. \"Laying okay?\" Missy didn't answer, she nodded. The way he was laying right now made him really sexy in Missy's eyes. One of his muscular arms were supporting his head while he lay there and his eyes were fixed on Missy. She looked back at him, glad she was close to the ground right now, otherwise she'd be taking one wrong step and be slammed to the floor. A yawn took over her mouth and she laughed. \"Now I'm finally tired.\" She exclaimed. \"No shit,\" Jan spoke. \"You were an animal on that dance floor!\" Missy laughed it off. \"No good timing on flirting right now, I'm really tired.\" She couldn't hear the rest of Jan's words, her eyes closed and she dozed off to a dream world. A grey mass made place for blackness. Missy's brain made his way from fast asleep to slowly wakening. Missy realised she was looking at the inside of her eyelids and tried to open them. A squishing pain entered her brain and tried to crack open her scull, at least it felt like it. Her breath escaped her mouth when she felt it and wanted to turn. That hurt even more and she stopped doing it, she now lay flat on her back. \"Look who's awake, sleepy.\" Her brother stood next to her bed comparing her to one of seven dwarfs. \"Buzz off.\" Missy whispered. \"Oh, I'm sorry, grumpy.\" Cliff smirked and exited her room. Missy was now fully awake, thanks Cliff, and felt her hangover. Oh God, she thought and moaned. Her head couldn't control gravity anymore, it was squashed by it. An hour later Missy dragged herself down the stairs, looking for something to eat. In the kitchen she found her brother with Torrance. \"Hey Missy.\" Torrance said cheery, and so awake! \"Hi,\" Missy mumbled while slumbering to the refrigerator. She opened it, but closed it soon after feeling everything grossing her out this morning. \"Ugh.\" She growled and turned to Cliff and Torrance with weak arms. She slumbered to the kitchen island and took a seat at the specially designed bar, now she understood why her mother wanted it so bad in the kitchen. Torrance was eating a multi vitamin lunch, a yogurt with fruit, while Cliff was eating cereal as lunch. Yes, it was late, VERY late, about 2 pm. \"Gimme a bowl.\" She demanded from her brother in a low hiss. \"You could say please.\" \"Now!\" She cut Cliff off. He went from superman to puppy face and brought her a bowl for her cereal. Missy made her breakfast with the milk and the cereal that stood before her. When her first bite was in he started asking about her night. \"Was it nice last night?\" Cliff asked. \"I wouldn't know.\" Missy shot at him. \"I think so.\" \"Can't you remember?\" Torrance asked in shock. \"Did someone hit you in the head with something?\" Missy looked Torrance in the eyes and smirked about the naïve little blonde. She was just so cute, Missy thought mocking. Cliff also looked at Torrance with a you're-kidding-can't-you-see-she-was-drunk-look. \"What?\" Torrance didn't know why everyone would stare at her in such a weird way. \"That guy should be reported to the police,… he's dangerous an- \" \"You are noticing I'm having a hangover over here, dontcha?\" Missy said sarcastic. Torrance looked at Cliff in shock. \"Yep, she was drunk.\" He added. \"You are aware you're only 18 right?!\" Torrance said in shock. \"19 in a few months.\" Missy added. \"You went to a club, and they let you in?\" \"They had Holly with them.\" Cliff hooked himself into the conversation. \"She can get you into everything, literally.\" \"Even into the LA zoo, at night.\" Missy mumbled, bended over her cereal. \"What?!\" Torrance shouted. \"And you let her?!\" \"Well yeah, I'm her baby brother, she doesn't listen to me.\" Cliff says being cute and Missy smiles at him. Once in a long time she was happy to have him to be her brother. \"And-eh, Jan called for you.\" Cliff adds quickly. \"Why?\" Missy says without looking up from her bowl. The first bite went in easy, now the second one shouldn't be such a problem. \"To see if you were alright.\" \"That is nice,\" Torrance says and Missy shoots her a glance. \"Why?\" \"He helped you into your bed last night, you were knock out.\" Cliff tells his big sister with a raised eyebrow. \"Oh, that is nice.\" Missy mumbles continuing her breakfast, madly trying to hide her blushing. \"Hey Miss!\" Missy walked through the local mall, looking for new clothes. Her old jeans were starting to wear out and she had spotted a nice top in one of the surf shops. When she heard her name she started turning and spotted Jan walking up to her. He lifted his arm and placed it strongly around her shoulder. Missy shivered when his bare skin made contact with hers and she started to create goose bumps all over her body. \"You haven't returned my call.\" He said after he pulled her with him past the shops. Missy couldn't protest and let herself be carried with him. Jan's words only made sense to her after a few seconds, when they truly reached her brains. She shook her head, as if in some sort of dream and looked at him. \"I-I'm sorry, I totally forgot,\" She started stammering. \"Ah, don't sweat it, at least we meet now, so what are you doing?\" Jan continued talking fast and dragging her still with him. Missy opened her mouth to speak but got distracted when she saw the surf shop pass her by. \"I w-was actually…\" She started. Oh, never mind, she thought. Like he want to go shopping for clothes with me. \"Going to Patt's CD's.\" She blurted out quick. \"Okay,\" He said with a chirpy smile and they walked to the CD store. It wasn't something Missy had expected, but they really had a good time together in the mall. Jan had taken her to the ice cream parlour and bought her a cone with chocolate ice cream and sprinkles. Then after two hours he had walked her to her car. He was so sweet, a real gentleman. Missy hadn't met much guys who were like that, making sure she had a good time and enjoyed her ice cream, not even her last boyfriend! She saw her car parked at the corner and felt disappointed the trip was already over. Why hadn't she parked that thing to blocks further? That way she would've got ten minutes more with this sweet guy. \"So ehm,…\" Missy started and tried to look at Jan without blushing. \"I really had a good time,\" He interrupted her with a genuine smile thrown at her. \"Yeah, me too.\" A silence followed where Missy stared at the ground, trying to think of what to say. \"Missy?\" Jan interrupted her thoughts. It dawned on her that his voice was really close now. She jerked her face up to meet his warm gaze and noticed he was standing a few inches away from her. \"Yeah?\" She squeaked. Jan's hand touched the side of her face and lowered his lips onto hers. Yeah, Missy thought, I had a good afternoon. But I guess the evening will be even better…","LastChapter":"The evening after we came second place in the finals, we had the biggest party you could ever imagine. Right there on the beach of Florida. It was amazing! The sun was beginning to set, Jan and Les had started a fire, which wasn't too big because they sucked at making one. But it was very sweet of them. Later on we invited the Clover girls to come and party with us, some agreed, but some still had something up their asses that they felt they were too good for us. Isis, the captain, however did come with a couple of her friends. But then again, we did have free booze. Anyway, it was one of the most best days of my life. Cliff finally made up with Torrance and they lay continuously smooching each other on the sand next to the fire. One of the clover guys had brought a radio and blasted some sort of hip-hop out of the speakers. Isis and her friends began to dance, I just watched. After a few minutes one of the girls made me dance with them, okay, it wasn't my style, so what? I had fun. The next day we all flew home and I reminded myself again why I didn't like being home sometimes. Missy opened the front door of her home and walked in. \"Hello!\" Cliff desperately called out in the house. Figures, Missy thought, no parents in sight and a flashing light on the voicemail. Missy walked to the device and pushed the button. \"Hi, it's Mom, the trip got a little extended so your father and me be out here for maybe a week more. There's money on the fridge if you need some. Love you, bye.\" Missy smirked from the message. \"They didn't even ask if I won a damn thing.\" She said to her brother whom walked into the kitchen. \"Well you know them, pretty busy.\" Cliff grabbed an apple from the fruit basket and started throwing it from his right hand to his left and back. Missy sighed and walked to the fridge. \"Two hundred bucks.\" She counted the dollars. \"Probably think we eat like the salvation army.\" \"Hey!\" Cliff yelled at her and continued sarcastic. \"Don't mock the homeless.\" \"Well sorry,\" She sarcastically shot back. \"But they give me two h-\" Missy paused for a second and then faced Cliff with a broad smile. \"We could call some friends to come over for pizza tonight.\" She said on a singing tone. Cliff agreed and couldn't wait to have Torrance back in his room again. An evil grin appeared on his face. Missy, not noticing his grin, had already grabbed the phone and dialled the number of her captain. Later that night, Missy and Cliff were accompanied by Torrance, Les, Kasey, Darcy and Jan. Courtney and Whitney weren't invited of course, they were über-bitches as Missy put it. Couches were moved and pillows were taken from upstairs. \"Okay,\" Jan walked into the living room holding seven boxes of pizza's. \"Who wanted the cheese & onion?\" Kasey and Darcy yelled and Jan handed their pizza's. \"Pepperoni?\" Torrance already stood up to meet her pizza halfway. \"Hawaii?\" Torrance made a squeak that this was Cliff's and grabbed that one too. \"Dude,\" Les stood up. \"I've got the same.\" Jan handed Les also an Hawaii pizza. \"That leaves these two,\" Jan sat down between Kasey and Missy. \"Chilli pizza for Missy and one for Jan.\" \"Oh, I love fast food.\" Missy gasped opening her pizza box and sitting up against the armrest which began poking in her side. \"Mom and dad never let us eat this!\" \"Uh-huh.\" Cliff agreed with his mouth full and with a piece of cheese dangling from his lips. \"Ah! Gross Cliff!\" Torrance whipped up the cheese and took a bite from her own pizza. Jan put his arms over the back of the couch, behind the heads of Missy and Kasey besides him. \"How're you supposed to eat any pizza?\" Kasey asked Jan. \"With my mouth,\" Jan answered neutral. \"But,\" Kasey pointed at the box on his lap, which was miles away from his mouth. \"You can't reach that.\" \"I hoped you, as my slaves, would feed me like ancient Greeks.\" Jan smiled broad as Missy and Kasey's faces twitched in disgust. \"Gross Jan!\" Missy slammed her elbow right in his ribs what made him gasp for air and sitting up straight again. \"Who's in for the movie?\" Les suggested and stood up to put the DVD in. There were some yells muffled by pizza and Les put the DVD on play. There they were, just like in Los Angeles for Cliff and Missy, together with their friends on the couch watching a movie. Jan, Missy, Darcy and Kasey were on the couch, while Cliff and Torrance were sitting happily together on the floor with Les on the other side. The next few hour and a half were filled by screams of the horror movie Jan and Les had picked out that afternoon. After the first movie a comedy followed. And after the pizza's the drinks followed. Jan had taken beer from home, while Les had brought wine (Typically Les, as Darcy muttered under her breath) and Missy and Cliff had their share from the 'secret' alcohol cabinet their father had in the kitchen. He would never notice it since he only filled it and no bottle had ever left the cabinet. Kasey made her first encounter with some kind of red drink, Cliff claimed it was some sort of Vodka drink, and fell in love with one of the cushions with which she peacefully fell asleep. Darcy became a little tipsy from the wine and began laughing very much. Les, whom had taken them to Missy and Cliff's house, stayed sober (after one glass of wine and three juices) for the girls so he could take them home. Torrance was a little far gone from the beer and was snuggled into Cliff's shoulder. Missy and Jan however, those guys didn't seem to have any flaw from the alcohol. They had grabbed the Xbox consoles and had been playing a race game against each other. \"I'm so gonna be ahead of you,\" Missy muttered sitting straight up with both feet on the couch under her. \"No you're not.\" Jan answered, his eyes fixed on the screen before them. At the end of the game Jan won. \"You cheated!\" Missy tried. But Jan shook his head. \"I'm just better.\" Les turned and grabbed the console from Missy and began playing against Jan. \"Let the male ego's fight each other, perfect idea.\" Cliff said sarcastic. \"Oh shut up man.\" Missy shut her brother up watching the screen closely. This time Les won and let Jan behind with his mouth fallen open by amazement. \"Oh man, you lost from a fag.\" Missy said laughing. \"There goes my manliness…\" Jan pouts at the screen while Missy gives him a comforting pat on the back. \"If it is any comforting,… there wasn't very much left of it even when you began the race.\" Missy started laughing very hard and took another zip from her fifth beer. Jan took one too, except he was at his seventh beer. While looking at the screen he said to Missy: \"Rumble? With dead or alive?\" \"I'm in.\" Missy said. \"Yeah, he will play against a girl, 'cuz it's the only way he can win.\" Les teased him while looking on his watch. It was two o'clock. \"I thing I'll be taking the girls home.\" Les began and stood up. Darcy woke Kasey and helped her off the couch. \"Bye man,\" Les said giving the now standing Jan a handshake they always did, with shoulder and all. \"See you around.\" Jan greeted him. Torrance was woken too and helped up by Cliff. She could just say goodnight to the girls and Les before they went to the front door. \"Bye, thanks for the company.\" Missy said to them as they went outside. They saw them stepping into the vehicle and Les started the engine. After checking the girls were on tight he waved at the audience at the door and drove away. \"Well that's that,\" Cliff spoke and closed the door. \"We're going to bed.\" \"Yeah, I-,\" Torrance was caught off guard by a sudden yawn. \"I'm tired.\" Missy frowned. \"We can see that,\" She smiled. \"I'll see you guys tomorrow.\" Cliff and Torrance disappeared up the stairs. \"What should we do now?\" Jan asked. \"I'm SO not tired right now.\" Missy pulled up her shoulders. \"I don't know.\" At that moment she heard a sound coming from upstairs. It sounded like her cell phone. \"Missy, your phone.\" Cliff yelled from upstairs. While she heard it she sprinted upstairs and saw that she had two messages. Reading them, she returned back downstairs. \"What's up?\" Jan asked. \"There's this friend from L.A. who sent me a message, Holly is her name, she asks me if I still want to come to the performance of Meadtown.\" While looking up she saw Jan's puzzled face. \"It's a local rock band in L.A.\" She quickly explained. \"Holly can get me in quick and free.\" \"What kind of a rock band is it?\" Jan asked. \"Well, all sorts, they have two female singer and one male, they play from soft rock to…, have you ever heard hard rock?\" Missy doubted that he has and perhaps he doesn't even want to go. \"Well, I once got a cd from a friend and I love it, but I don't know what is you're talking about.\" Jan told her. Missy frowned. \"What was the band's name?\" \"Something with Roach… aw, I can't remember.\" Jan told her. Missy had one eyebrow raised. \"Papa roach!\" Missy quickly says in recognition and Jan nodded. \"This band plays a little from them, and other covers like that, but also original numbers.\" Jan's eyes widened and he smiled. \"Then I'd love to go.\" Jan said smiling. \"I'll call her right now.\" Missy dialled a number and held the phone to her ear. \"Hey Holly, It's Missy, What?... Oh yeah, where?... okay, 'till how long? Hold on.\" Missy took the phone off her ear. \"It's until five in the morning, have a problem with that?\" Jan shook his head. \"I have absolutely no life.\" He chuckled. Missy smirked and went back to her phone. \"Okay, yeah, it's okay, … see you in a half an hour.\" Missy hung up. \"Isn't L.A. like an hour driving?\" Jan asked. \"I guess, but we're going fifteen minutes driving from here.\" Missy walked up the stairs to Cliff's room. \"Cliff?\" She knocked on the door and the boy opened. \"We're going out okay?\" \"Where are you going?\" Cliff asks sleepy. \"To Root's, Holly's there.\" Cliff nodded. \"Okay, when're you back?\" \"Probably round six, or later.\" Missy told his brother and said goodnight. After this she turned around and saw Jan approaching her. \"I'll be just quick changing this shirt.\" Missy disappeared once again, but now into her room. She exited once again with a glittering black top and a very low v-neck. You could now notice she had a gold chain around her neck. Jan raised his eye brow at her appearance. \"Jan? Are you coming?\" She asked and he followed her like a loyal puppy. Everything for a beautiful lady. They decided to take Jan's jeep, it was after all bigger than Missy's. With Missy giving him direction, they found their way to Root's. Lying in some industrial area, it looked like some kind of unknown bunker. Missy had been there before, lots of times when she was a bit younger. Jan had already asked how they could get in while they weren't even 21. That's where Holly came in, Missy told him, she had always gotten her and friends into almost any bar where they asked for ID's. Holly seemed to had a good eye for the bouncers. Or just great legs. Jan parked the jeep next to a row of cars in the grass and they got out of the vehicle. When they got near the entrance a blond girl approached them. \"Missy,\" The girl with blond curly hair approached the female cheerleader and hugged her tight. \"Haven't seen you in months, how are you?\" \"Great, you?\" Missy asked being as enthusiastic as the girl. \"Good, and who's this?\" The girl quickly turned to Jan. \"I'm Jan.\" He held out his hand and she shook it. Jan couldn't help but check out Holly's body. She had long perfect legs which were half covered by a long velvet skirt. Two plackets showed her bare legs at the sides, her hips were almost shown. Holly's top was also tight and also black, with long sleeves. \"Ah, boyfriend ey? I'm Holly, I'll get you in quick and free.\" The girl said quick and turned, but she was held back by Jan's voice. \"We aren't…\" He trailed off after seeing Holly had gotten the message. \"Never were.\" \"Oh, sorry, I assumed,\" The blonde apologized. \"You Missy, with a guy, together. Anyway, I'll get you in.\" She turned quickly and walked to the entrance. A big bouncer caught their attention. \"It's cool Carey, they're with me.\" Holly said and the bouncer let them through. Inside the hard sound of guitars and drums filled their ears. Holly leapt towards them again. \"Me, Ginger and Kim are over there, you can sit with us for drinks.\" Holly screamed over the music. Jan offered to get some drinks and Missy walked with Holly over to the table. \"Missy!\" Ginger and Kim yelled together. Missy was crushed into a hug between the two girls. \"Who's the guy?\" \"Ow, his name's Jan.\" Missy told the girls. \"He's jummy.\" Ginger said and Missy laughed. \"Is he yours?\" \"Nope.\" Missy said. The girls frowned. \"Why not?\" \"Well, he's one of my best friends, no chemistry there.\" She yelled into Kim's ear. \"Can I have him?\" Ginger asked. \"That's what you have to sort out with Kim.\" Missy told her and Jan came tot the table with three beers and two glasses of Bacardi coke. \"Come one, let's dance.\" Jan asked Missy and pulled her to dance. Missy didn't know what happened to her. Within seconds they were dancing close together to the rhythm of 'I can dream' originally from Skunk Anansie. Jan was such a good dancer. He grabbed her when she went too far away from him and let her go on the right moments when Missy needed some space to get wild. The moment she was getting so into him and his dancing, a quick number was played and Jan let go of her. Missy saw Ginger approach and take hold of Jan before she could. A guy behind her began dancing with her and Missy didn't mind, … at first. The more the night proceeded, the more Jan danced with Kim or Ginger. And the more Missy got the urge to take him back violently, like he shouldn't dance with them. He shouldn't, they were kind of man eaters. They would sleep with them, tell all people in their environment they were terrible and then dump them by claiming they deserve better. That's just how they are, and that's not how Jan is! Well … not exactly. But he just shouldn't be dancing with them! What the hell! Missy called herself back to reality, he can dance with who ever he wants! At five o'clock the performance was over and Kim and Ginger wrote their names and numbers on a paper that Jan took with him. They told him he should call them sometimes. Missy got more pissed every second, she felt like beating the crap out of those two sluts. After saying goodbye she quickly dragged Jan to his jeep and made him open the door. \"That was a fun evening,\" Jan said and heard something grumping next to him. \"What did you say Missy?\" \"Nothing, I think I have a headache.\" She said and rubbed her head. Maybe she would feel better if she got some fresh air. Missy tilted her head and took a deep whiff of air, walking a bit away from the vehicle. At that moment she felt all the beers and noticed she was really drunk. She usually felt this when she was slowing down on the evening with too much alcohol still in her veins. The world began turning a bit and the next thing she knew she was looking at her own vomit in the grass. \"Are you okay?\" Jan shouted from the car. Missy got up quick and walked back to the car. \"I ate pizza.\" She said wiping her mouth. Jan handed her a bottle of water he kept in his car. \"Here drink this, it will clear your mouth.\" She drank some and her mouth was washed from the vomit. She looked back at the car and she saw he was putting the back seats down. \"What are you doing?\" She asked putting the bottle back. \"We can't drive like this, we'll spend the night here and I'll take you home tomorrow, if you slept off your hangover.\" He told her while laying some blankets on the now flat baggage space. Missy gave up and laid down on them, Jan next to her and putting the trunk door down. Okay, it was bigger than her beetle, but they still had to curl up together a bit, also to keep warm. Jan put the blanket over them and looked at her. \"Laying okay?\" Missy didn't answer, she nodded. The way he was laying right now made him really sexy in Missy's eyes. One of his muscular arms were supporting his head while he lay there and his eyes were fixed on Missy. She looked back at him, glad she was close to the ground right now, otherwise she'd be taking one wrong step and be slammed to the floor. A yawn took over her mouth and she laughed. \"Now I'm finally tired.\" She exclaimed. \"No shit,\" Jan spoke. \"You were an animal on that dance floor!\" Missy laughed it off. \"No good timing on flirting right now, I'm really tired.\" She couldn't hear the rest of Jan's words, her eyes closed and she dozed off to a dream world. A grey mass made place for blackness. Missy's brain made his way from fast asleep to slowly wakening. Missy realised she was looking at the inside of her eyelids and tried to open them. A squishing pain entered her brain and tried to crack open her scull, at least it felt like it. Her breath escaped her mouth when she felt it and wanted to turn. That hurt even more and she stopped doing it, she now lay flat on her back. \"Look who's awake, sleepy.\" Her brother stood next to her bed comparing her to one of seven dwarfs. \"Buzz off.\" Missy whispered. \"Oh, I'm sorry, grumpy.\" Cliff smirked and exited her room. Missy was now fully awake, thanks Cliff, and felt her hangover. Oh God, she thought and moaned. Her head couldn't control gravity anymore, it was squashed by it. An hour later Missy dragged herself down the stairs, looking for something to eat. In the kitchen she found her brother with Torrance. \"Hey Missy.\" Torrance said cheery, and so awake! \"Hi,\" Missy mumbled while slumbering to the refrigerator. She opened it, but closed it soon after feeling everything grossing her out this morning. \"Ugh.\" She growled and turned to Cliff and Torrance with weak arms. She slumbered to the kitchen island and took a seat at the specially designed bar, now she understood why her mother wanted it so bad in the kitchen. Torrance was eating a multi vitamin lunch, a yogurt with fruit, while Cliff was eating cereal as lunch. Yes, it was late, VERY late, about 2 pm. \"Gimme a bowl.\" She demanded from her brother in a low hiss. \"You could say please.\" \"Now!\" She cut Cliff off. He went from superman to puppy face and brought her a bowl for her cereal. Missy made her breakfast with the milk and the cereal that stood before her. When her first bite was in he started asking about her night. \"Was it nice last night?\" Cliff asked. \"I wouldn't know.\" Missy shot at him. \"I think so.\" \"Can't you remember?\" Torrance asked in shock. \"Did someone hit you in the head with something?\" Missy looked Torrance in the eyes and smirked about the naïve little blonde. She was just so cute, Missy thought mocking. Cliff also looked at Torrance with a you're-kidding-can't-you-see-she-was-drunk-look. \"What?\" Torrance didn't know why everyone would stare at her in such a weird way. \"That guy should be reported to the police,… he's dangerous an- \" \"You are noticing I'm having a hangover over here, dontcha?\" Missy said sarcastic.

Once in a long time she was happy to have him to be her brother. \"And-eh, Jan called for you.\" Cliff adds quickly. \"Why?\" Missy says without looking up from her bowl.

WHAM.xa0 I ran smack into someone's chest, nearlyrngetting knocked over in the process.xa0 Irnmanaged to keep my balance and therefore avoided falling on my ass, but,rnunfortunately, dropped my notebook and car keys in the process.xa0 Hoping that I hadn't run into some sort ofrngang member, I crouched down to retrieve my stuff. \"Here, letrnme grab that for you,\" said a voice, which I presumed belonged to the chestrnthat my face had just encountered.xa0 Irnglanced up, and found myself staring into a pair of gorgeous eyes.xa0 Way to go, Missy, I thought.xa0 Run into the hottest boy in school withinrnyour first fifteen minutes.xa0 He grabbedrnmy car keys (I had already retrieved my notebook) and we both stood up.xa0 I stared up at him, desperately trying tornthink of something to say other than \"You are one fine piece of ass.\"xa0 He appeared to be about a foot taller thanrnme, sporting those eyes that I already mentioned, dark, spiky hair, and arnslightly cocky smile.xa0 He was wearingrnjeans and a button up shirt, and looked like he lifted half-ton weights in hisrnspare time. \"Sorryrnabout that,\" he said, depositing my keys into my hand.xa0 I blinked a few times, trying to think of anrnappropriate response.xa0 Come on, Missy, Irnthought.xa0 Introduce yourself.xa0 Meeting a hot boy is never a bad thing. \"Yeah,rnwell, maybe you should watch where you're going,\" I muttered.xa0 I ducked around him and continued toward thernstaircase.xa0 Only after I had finallyrnfound my homeroom and sat down did I realize how much of an idiot I was.xa0 This guy was nice enough to help me retrievernmy stuff and apologize, and how do I react? xa0In my typical manner, of course.xa0rnI sighed as the P.A. system crackled to life.xa0 Folding my arms up to my chest, I listened to the announcementsrnand hoped that the rest of my day would go better. ***************************** I stared uprnat the walls of the guidance counselor's office, waiting not-so-patiently forrnher to finish a phone call.xa0 My stomachrngrowled, reminding me that this was a complete and utter waste of my lunchrnperiod.xa0 To try and distract myself, Irnstared at the cool new tattoo that I had given myself during fourth periodrnhistory class.xa0 Boredom brings out myrnartistic side. \"So, Sissy,rnwhat is it that I can do for you today?\"xa0rnI looked up to see that Mrs. Wong had put down the phone and was nowrnfocusing her full attention on me. \"Actually,rnit's Missy.xa0 And I wanted to know how Irncould go about signing up for the gymnastics team.\" She smiledrnat me.xa0 \"Oh, I'm sorry, you must havernbeen misinformed.xa0 We haven't had arngymnastics team at Rancho Carne for several years.\" I blinked,rntrying to fully process what Mrs. Wong was saying.xa0 \"What do you mean there's no gymnastics team?xa0 That's how I want to fulfill my gymrnrequirement!\"xa0 According to my welcomernpacket from Rancho Carne, I could be excused from having to take two years ofrngym if I participated in a varsity sport.xa0rn\"You don't understand.xa0 I'mrnawesome at gymnastics.xa0 I've beenrncompeting for years.xa0 I won the – \" \"Well, ifrnour physical education department holds no interest to you, perhaps there isrnanother team you might want to try for?xa0rnWe have ice dancing, water polo, cheerleading – \" This time,rnI cut her off.xa0 \"You mean you have icerndancing, but not a gymnastics team?xa0 Andrnwe're in California?\" Mrs. Wongrnsmiled brightly.xa0 \"Our ice dancing teamrnis one of the top in the state.xa0 Although,rnto be honest, Millie, I think your gymnastics talent might be a great asset tornour cheerleading team.xa0 Spots are veryrncoveted on the squad, but yesterday one of the members broke her leg and won'trnbe able to participate in the rest of the season.xa0 Try outs are going to be in the gym this afternoon at four.xa0 I really think you should consider it.\"xa0 She flashed me another smile.

I still couldn't believe that I wasrnactually trying out. xa0I mean,rncheerleading.xa0 The idea repulsed mernbeyond all imagination.xa0 But, somehow,rnafter my last class, my feet had led me to the outside of the gym where I foundrna small congregation of people filling out forms.xa0 Before I could think too much about what I was actually doing, Irnhad grabbed one and filled in the information.xa0rnNow I was standing there, holding my form, listening to the maniac nextrnto me who had just broken up with her boyfriend, and seriously considering thernsanity of my choice. As the minutes ticked a way, Irnwatched the line in front of me dwindle.xa0rnMost of them seemed fairly expressionless as they walked out, with thernexception of one guy, who burst out the door and sprinted down the hallrnscreaming, \"Hold the audition!!!!\"xa0rnFinally, I was the only one left in the hallway.xa0 A moment later, a petite Asian girl exitedrnthe gymnasium, smiling.xa0 This wasrnit.xa0 This was my moment of truth.xa0 Come on, I thought to myself.xa0 Just do a few back handsprings and call it arnday.xa0 I took a deep breath, and then letrnmyself into the gym. As I walked in, I tried not to lookrnanywhere near as nervous as I felt.xa0 Therncheerleaders sat at the front of the gym behind a long table.xa0 I glanced up and down the line, wondering ifrn– Holy shit.xa0 Oh my god.xa0 It was him.xa0rnHottie boy.xa0 And he was arncheerleader. My thoughts about hottie boy'srnsexuality were cut off by a remark from one of the blonde girls at the table. \"Tattoos are strictlyrnverboten.xa0 Sorry!\" she said, giving me arnbig, bitchy smile.xa0 I realized instantlyrnthat my semi-dredlocks and wallet chain didn't exactly fit in with theirrnperfectly uniformed cuteness.xa0 Well, ifrnthey wanted a bitch, they would get a bitch. Raising my left arm up towards myrnface, I sent her the biggest shit-eating smile I could muster.xa0 Slowly, I raised my middle finger and lickedrnit.xa0 I then used the moisture on myrnfinger to smear the ink on my \"tattoo.\" \"I got bored during fourth period,\"rnI said, as innocently as possible.xa0 Thernblonde girl and the Asian girl sitting next to her glared at me.xa0 The Asian girl picked up one of therncheerleading forms from the stack in front of her and held it up in the air. \"You need to fill one of thesernout,\" she said in a voice that implied that she was speaking to anrnexceptionally slow child. \"Did it.\"xa0 I cut her off with a smirk.xa0rnA dark haired girl sitting at the end of the table reached for it.xa0 As I handed it to her, she snatched it outrnof my hand.xa0 I watched as hottie boyrnleaned over to study my information.xa0 Irnfound myself wishing that he would memorize my phone number. \"Missy, is it?xa0 Before we start, I'm afraid we're going tornneed to make sure you can do a standing back tuck.xa0 Standard procedure.xa0 You understand.\"xa0 The brown haired girl looked like nothingrnwould give her more pleasure than to watch me fall on my ass trying.xa0 Well, I hadn't spent fourteen years of myrnlife doing gymnastics for nothing. \"Standing back handspring back tuckrnokay?\"xa0 I tossed my wallet out of myrnpocket and tried not to look at hottie boy, who was staring at me with whatrnlooked like shock on his face.xa0 Irnlaunched into a back handspring back tuck.xa0rnLike riding a bike, I thought as I landed the back tuck andrnre-approached the table.xa0 A quick glancernat hottie boy made my heart skip a beat as I saw the large grin spreadingrnacross his face. \"Where's this girl from, Romania?\"rnsnarled the blonde.xa0 Before I could makerna retort, she threw out her hands.xa0 \"Canrnshe yell?\" \"We'll try an oldie,\" said anotherrnblonde girl, who was sitting at the center of the table.xa0 Unlike the others, however, her tone wasn'trnlaced with hostility.xa0 She sat uprnstraighter and gave me a look that implied I was to repeat what she did. \"Like awesome!xa0 Oh wow!xa0rnLike totally freak me out!xa0 Irnmean right on!xa0 The Torros sure arernnumber one!\"xa0 She shouted with a volumernthat easily reached all the way across the school gym.xa0 I glanced up and down the row of faces,rnchecking to see if this was an elaborate joke.xa0rnI was actually supposed to say that without laughing? I took a deep breath and began tornyell, hoping to match her perkiness.xa0 \"Irntransferred from Los Angeles, your school has no gymnastics team, this is arnlast resort!\" I had to fight to hold in myrnlaughter at the sight of the cheerleaders' faces.xa0 Hottie boy looked like someone had just told him that Christmasrnwas cancelled.xa0 I figured I'd better sayrnsomething if I wanted to salvage any remaining hope of making the team. \"Okay, so I've never cheeredrnbefore.xa0 So what?xa0 How about something that actually requiresrnneurons?\" \"Do it,\" I heard the bitchy blondernmutter under her breath to the Asian girl, who turned to me and spoke. \"Front handspring, step out, roundrnoff, back handspring, step out, round off, back handspring, full twistingrnlayout,\" she finished with a flourish.xa0rnThe others at the table seemed to think she was insane.xa0 I could see hottie boy glaring at her, whichrnmade me feel really good about what I was about to do.xa0 I shook my head and laughed a little as Irnturned and walked towards the back of the gym.xa0rnAs I was walking, I realized that I couldn't really remember half ofrnwhat the Asian girl had said.xa0 It didn'trnreally matter.xa0 I would just unleash arnlittle bit and then see what they thought. Reaching the end of the gym, Irnturned so I was again facing the table, which seemed very tiny and farrnaway.xa0 I took a few steps and let myselfrnfall into the zone.xa0 I started with arncartwheel and went immediately into a front walkover, which I followed with arnback handspring.xa0 Turning around, I launchedrninto another cartwheel, followed by another back handspring.xa0 Going full out now, I tossed myself into thernair and executed a full twisting layout that would've made my old coachrnproud.xa0 I made sure that the smile wasrnmostly off of my face before I turned back so I was facing the table. Everyone appeared to be pleasedrnwith what I had done, with the exception, of course, of the blonde and thernAsian, who I was thinking of dubbing the Bitch Sisters.xa0 The nice blonde girl at the center of therntable was the first to speak. \"Missy is bank!\" she exclaimed,rnwhich I assumed from her tone was a high form of praise.xa0 Blonde Bitch Sister scoffed. \"Bankrupt!xa0 We've already so decided on Jamie.\"xa0 I could feel any last remnants of my smilernfading.xa0 There was bitchy, and there wasrnbeyond belief.xa0 I was beginning tornconsider running from the room and slashing some tires. \"Courtney, this is not arndemocracy.xa0 This is a cheerocracy.xa0 I'm sorry, but I'm overruling you.\"xa0 The blonde girl at the center of the table,rnI was beginning to figure, must be the captain.xa0 And I now had a name for Blonde Bitch Sister.xa0 Courtney.xa0rnWell, that sounded slutty. Speaking of Courtney, she did notrnlook happy with the sudden turn of events.xa0rn\"You are being a cheertator Torrance, and a pain in my ass!\" she yelled,rnstanding up.xa0 Asian Bitch Sister quicklyrnfollowed suit.xa0 The expression on herrnface said she was far from finished. \"We already voted.\"xa0 Courtney paused and turned towards me, anrnexpression of pure malice on her face.xa0rn\"Besides.xa0 Missy looks like anrnuber-dyke!\"xa0 Courtney burst intorngiggles, as did Asian Bitch Sister. I stood frozen for a moment,rnfeeling as if I had been slapped in the face.xa0rnWhat was I doing here?xa0 What forrna moment had made me think that I would find any friends in these types ofrnpeople?xa0 I bent down, grabbed my keysrnoff of the floor, and hightailed it out of the gym.xa0 By the time I got to my car, I was practically sprinting.xa0 I slammed the door and threw the car intorndrive, not even bothering to put on my seat belt.xa0 All I wanted to do was sit alone in my room. ******************************* An hourrnlater, I was feeling a little better.xa0 Irnwas laying on my bed playing with my Silly Putty and listening to a Nine InchrnNails CD.xa0 Cliff had wandered upstairsrnto harass me, but I had just told him to leave me alone.xa0 The funny thing is, he had actuallyrnlistened.xa0 Maybe school had brainwashedrnhim. Right asrnthe last notes of \"Closer\" finished up, I heard the doorbell ring.xa0 Rolling off of my bed, I exited my bedroomrnand started towards the stairs.xa0 Irnapproached them just in time to see Cliff answering the door.xa0 Oh well.xa0rnI decided that I had to pee, and headed to the bathroom.xa0 As I emerged from the bathroom, I overheardrna very familiar voice saying my name from outside the front hall. \"What thernhell?\" I muttered, heading downstairs.xa0rnAs I approached the door, I could see Cliff talking to Torrance, thernblond captain from my cheerleading tryout.xa0rnNow I was really confused. \"Is herrndrug dependency going to be a problem?\" Cliff said, obviously unaware that Irnwas approaching.xa0 My brother, therncomedian. \"Cliff.xa0 Shut up.\"xa0rnI turned to face Torrance and folded my arms, leaning against therndoorframe.xa0 \"What do you want?\" \"I want yournon the squad.\"xa0 Her sincerity was enoughrnto make me laugh. \"You're thernbest.xa0 They know it,\" sherncontinued.xa0 \"They just reject thernunfamiliar.\" I shook myrnhead.xa0 This had to end here andrnnow.xa0 \"Thanks but no thanks.xa0 I plead temporary insanity.xa0 See, I'm a hardcore gymnast.xa0 No way jumping up and down screaming 'Gornteam go!' is gonna satisfy me.\" \"Look,rnwe're gymnasts too, except no beam, no bar, no vault.\" Was thisrngirl deaf?xa0 \"Sorry, not interested.\" Irnturned and began to close the door, hoping Torrance would get the hint.xa0 However, the only thing the door slammedrninto was my brother, who didn't look like he was moving any time soon. \"What arernyou doing?\" I asked.xa0 If Cliff was evenrngoing to screw with me now… \"Nothing, Irnjust thought it was uh… interesting hearing Torrance's point of view,\" saidrnCliff, nodding at Torrance. Hang on arnminute. \"How do yourneven know her?\" \"We're oldrnfriends,\" said Cliff.xa0 Torrance rolledrnher eyes and looked back at me. \"Ever beenrnto a cheerleading competition?\" \"Oh, yournmean like a football game?\" I said, amused. \"No, not arngame.xa0 Those are like practices forrnus.xa0 I'm talking about a tournament.xa0 ESPN cameras all around, hundreds of peoplernin the crowd cheering…\" \"Wait,\"rnCliff interjected.xa0 \"People cheeringrncheerleaders?\" he asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"That'srnright!\" said Torrance, in a tone that matched his.xa0 \"Lots of people.xa0 Here'srnthe deal Missy.xa0 We're the shit, thernbest.xa0 We have fun, we work hard, and wernwin national championships.xa0 I'mrnoffering you a chance to be a part of that.\" I don'trnknow why, but something about the way she said it made me think.xa0 I stared down at the ground, trying torncollect my thoughts. \"Thinkrnabout it Miss!\" said Cliff, in his most annoying fake happy voice.xa0 \"I mean you get to wear sassy outfits, yournget to yell like you care about something!\"xa0rnLike I said, my brother the comedian. \"She's notrnthe cheering type,\" snickered Cliff, for Torrance's benefit I suppose.xa0 Something snapped inside my head.xa0 Screw him.xa0rnScrew the Bitch Sisters.xa0 Screwrnmom and dad for forcing me to move.xa0 Irnwould show everyone. \"You knowrnwhat?xa0 Count me in.\"xa0 As Torrance's face broke out into a grin, Irndecided that whatever I would have to endure for the next few months would bernworth it, if only for the look that I had just witnessed on my brother. ***************************************** \"Sorneveryone, this is Missy.xa0 Missy, this isrnthe squad,\" said Torrance, indicating towards the various cheerleaders groupedrnin front of me.xa0 I nodded, feelingrnfairly self-conscious.xa0 I'd realizedrnthis morning that I really didn't have anything in my wardrobe that qualifiedrnas cheerleading attire.xa0 I'd finallyrnsettled on some black warm-up pants that I used to wear over my leotard inrngymnastics.xa0 I'd initially put on arnblack sports bra on top, but then realized that there was no way I felt securernenough about myself to prance around with my stomach hanging out in front ofrnall of these strangers.xa0 Finally, I'drnthrown on a red tank top and rushed out of my house so I'd make it to practicernon time. Duringrnlunch that day, Torrance had given me my very own Rancho Carne Torros cheerleadingrnuniform, and attempted to explain some basic cheerleading rules to me.xa0 It was all very confusing. \"Missy,\"rnsaid Torrance, snapping me out of my thoughts, \"This is Darcy.\"xa0 She pointed to brown haired girl who hadrnbeen mean to me at my tryout the other day.xa0rnShe nodded at me without much interest. \"And thisrnis Whitney.\"xa0 Asian Bitch Sister. \"This isrnCourtney.\"xa0 I gave her my best glare. \"Casey.\"xa0 Slightly dopey looking. \"Les.\"xa0 Torrance had pointed out a tall, brownrnhaired guy, who, to my shock, gave me a wide grin.xa0 Hesitantly, I smiled back.xa0rnHe seemed nice. \"This isrnJan.\"xa0 I drew in a sharp breath asrnTorrance pointed out hottie boy.xa0rnJan.xa0 I liked that name. Torrancerncontinued her introductions, but I wasn't really listening.xa0 I was too busy studying Jan's arms, whichrnwere very accentuated by his white sleeveless shirt. \"Missy?\"xa0 I shook my head, snapping out of myrnreverie.xa0 Torrance was giving me herrnperpetually cheerful grin. \"You can gornsit down over there.xa0 We already warmedrnup before you got here, you can start doing warm-up exercises with usrntomorrow.xa0 We're just going to runrnthrough our main routine this year – well, as much of it as we have down rightrnnow – so you can get the feel for it.xa0rnThen we'll start to work on our more basic cheers and you can joinrnin.xa0 Okay?' I nodded,rnand walked across the floor to take a seat.xa0rnSimultaneously, I crossed my arms and my legs, feeling very, veryrnnervous.xa0 I watched the cheerleadersrngather into place.xa0 Well, the girlsrngather into place.xa0 The boys seemed tornbe occupied with standing around, stretching and looking manly.xa0 Mmm.xa0rnJan was looking especially manly.xa0rnA sudden outburst of yelling alerted me to the beginning of the cheer. \"I SAIDrnBRRR!xa0 IT'S COLD IN HERE.xa0 I SAID THERE MUST BE SOME TORROS IN THErnATMOSPHERE!\" I frowned,rnwatching the choreography that was accompanying their yelling.xa0 It looked familiar.xa0 Way too familiar. \"I SAID OHrnEE OH EE OH!xa0 ICE ICE BABY.xa0 OH EE OH EE OH!xa0 ICE ICE BABY.\" Music brokernout, but I wasn't about to stick around and watch the dance moves that Irnalready knew were coming.xa0 I grabbed myrnstuff and hurried out of the gym. As I walkedrnacross the parking lot, I had a moment of regret.xa0 This officially meant I would never, ever, get the opportunity torntalk to Jan ever again.xa0 But my momentrnpassed.xa0 I wasn't stupid enough to bernpart of a group that would mess with the kids from East Compton. As I wasrngetting into my Beetle, I heard the unmistakable sound of Torrance's voice,rnshrilling across the parking lot.","LastChapter":"A/N:xa0 This will bernMissy/Jan eventually.xa0 It's the wholernmovie, as told through Missy's POV.xa0rnReviews will be rewarded with virtual chocolate bars. \"And good morning!xa0 It's six o' clock in I'm DJ the morning, andrnAdam, spinning some great tunes for you to wake up and start your dayrnwith.xa0 The sun is already shining, andrnlook for highs in the mid seventies today.xa0rnSo let's start out my shift with something from a few years back thatrnstill gets me out of bed in the morning.xa0rnHere's \"Burn Baby Burn\" by Ash, on 88.3, your home for rock.\" I blinked arnfew times before rolling over to stare at the bright red numbers on my alarmrnclock.xa0 I had just been rudely awakenedrnfrom a beautiful dream involving myself, a deserted beachfront, and GavinrnRossdale.xa0 Dammit, dammit, dammit.xa0 I dragged myself out of bed and headed forrnthe bathroom that my brother Cliff and I share.xa0 I peeked into his bedroom.xa0rnHe was most definitely still in heavy slumber.xa0 The bastard probably wouldn't wake up until fifteen minutesrnbefore school started.xa0 Sometimes I wishrnI were a boy, if only for the lack of caring that they seem to have about theirrnappearance.

As Irnbrushed my teeth, I stared in the mirror at my reflection.xa0 I had put my hair in twists last night afterrnI washed it, and it had more or less survived intact.xa0 Now all that needed planning was an outfit. I headedrnback to my room.xa0 Opening my closet, Irnstared at the selection that spread itself before me.xa0 I could make a statement with what I wore.xa0 Such as \"I don't care.\"xa0 Or perhaps \"Screw you.\"xa0 My parents call me Sunshine for a reason. Afterrnputting on my pants and t-shirt, I completed my look with some requisite blackrneye liner.xa0 I headed downstairs, hopingrnto find some caffeine before I had to drive to school.xa0 Downstairs I encountered my brother wearingrnhis lucky Clash t-shirt, and eating the last of the Coco Puffs. \"Bastard,\"rnI muttered, selecting the box of Cheerios as a much more boring alternative.

WHAM.xa0 I ran smack into someone's chest, nearlyrngetting knocked over in the process.xa0 Irnmanaged to keep my balance and therefore avoided falling on my ass, but,rnunfortunately, dropped my notebook and car keys in the process.xa0 Hoping that I hadn't run into some sort ofrngang member, I crouched down to retrieve my stuff. \"Here, letrnme grab that for you,\" said a voice, which I presumed belonged to the chestrnthat my face had just encountered.xa0 Irnglanced up, and found myself staring into a pair of gorgeous eyes.xa0 Way to go, Missy, I thought.xa0 Run into the hottest boy in school withinrnyour first fifteen minutes.xa0 He grabbedrnmy car keys (I had already retrieved my notebook) and we both stood up.xa0 I stared up at him, desperately trying tornthink of something to say other than \"You are one fine piece of ass.\"xa0 He appeared to be about a foot taller thanrnme, sporting those eyes that I already mentioned, dark, spiky hair, and arnslightly cocky smile.xa0 He was wearingrnjeans and a button up shirt, and looked like he lifted half-ton weights in hisrnspare time. \"Sorryrnabout that,\" he said, depositing my keys into my hand.xa0 I blinked a few times, trying to think of anrnappropriate response.xa0 Come on, Missy, Irnthought.xa0 Introduce yourself.xa0 Meeting a hot boy is never a bad thing. \"Yeah,rnwell, maybe you should watch where you're going,\" I muttered.xa0 I ducked around him and continued toward thernstaircase.xa0 Only after I had finallyrnfound my homeroom and sat down did I realize how much of an idiot I was.xa0 This guy was nice enough to help me retrievernmy stuff and apologize, and how do I react? xa0In my typical manner, of course.xa0rnI sighed as the P.A. system crackled to life.xa0 Folding my arms up to my chest, I listened to the announcementsrnand hoped that the rest of my day would go better. ***************************** I stared uprnat the walls of the guidance counselor's office, waiting not-so-patiently forrnher to finish a phone call.xa0 My stomachrngrowled, reminding me that this was a complete and utter waste of my lunchrnperiod.xa0 To try and distract myself, Irnstared at the cool new tattoo that I had given myself during fourth periodrnhistory class.xa0 Boredom brings out myrnartistic side. \"So, Sissy,rnwhat is it that I can do for you today?\"xa0rnI looked up to see that Mrs. Wong had put down the phone and was nowrnfocusing her full attention on me. \"Actually,rnit's Missy.xa0 And I wanted to know how Irncould go about signing up for the gymnastics team.\" She smiledrnat me.xa0 \"Oh, I'm sorry, you must havernbeen misinformed.xa0 We haven't had arngymnastics team at Rancho Carne for several years.\" I blinked,rntrying to fully process what Mrs. Wong was saying.xa0 \"What do you mean there's no gymnastics team?xa0 That's how I want to fulfill my gymrnrequirement!\"xa0 According to my welcomernpacket from Rancho Carne, I could be excused from having to take two years ofrngym if I participated in a varsity sport.xa0rn\"You don't understand.xa0 I'mrnawesome at gymnastics.xa0 I've beenrncompeting for years.xa0 I won the – \" \"Well, ifrnour physical education department holds no interest to you, perhaps there isrnanother team you might want to try for?xa0rnWe have ice dancing, water polo, cheerleading – \" This time,rnI cut her off.xa0 \"You mean you have icerndancing, but not a gymnastics team?xa0 Andrnwe're in California?\" Mrs. Wongrnsmiled brightly.xa0 \"Our ice dancing teamrnis one of the top in the state.xa0 Although,rnto be honest, Millie, I think your gymnastics talent might be a great asset tornour cheerleading team.xa0 Spots are veryrncoveted on the squad, but yesterday one of the members broke her leg and won'trnbe able to participate in the rest of the season.xa0 Try outs are going to be in the gym this afternoon at four.xa0 I really think you should consider it.\"xa0 She flashed me another smile. I rolled myrneyes.xa0 \"Sure.xa0 Cheerleading.xa0 Yeah, countrnme in alright.\"xa0 I grabbed my stuff andrnwalked out of her office.xa0 I had alreadyrnwasted too much of my lunch period.xa0rnCheerleading?xa0 Right.xa0 Missy Pantone, the most spirited girl atrnRancho Carne.xa0 Like that would everrnhappen.xa0 I sighed, resigning myself torntwo years of sweaty gym uniforms and vicious dodge ball games. *************************************** \"And then he told me that if Irncan't accept his independence, well, then, maybe we just didn't belongrntogether.xa0 And then he -- hexa0 - WAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!\"xa0 The girl next to me burst into tears for thernsixth time during our two-minute conversation.xa0rnI sighed, and checked my watch.xa0rnI had been standing in line for only a few minutes, but it felt likernforever.xa0 How long did it take tornconduct a stupid try out anyways? I still couldn't believe that I wasrnactually trying out. xa0I mean,rncheerleading.xa0 The idea repulsed mernbeyond all imagination.xa0 But, somehow,rnafter my last class, my feet had led me to the outside of the gym where I foundrna small congregation of people filling out forms.xa0 Before I could think too much about what I was actually doing, Irnhad grabbed one and filled in the information.xa0rnNow I was standing there, holding my form, listening to the maniac nextrnto me who had just broken up with her boyfriend, and seriously considering thernsanity of my choice. As the minutes ticked a way, Irnwatched the line in front of me dwindle.xa0rnMost of them seemed fairly expressionless as they walked out, with thernexception of one guy, who burst out the door and sprinted down the hallrnscreaming, \"Hold the audition!!!!\"xa0rnFinally, I was the only one left in the hallway.xa0 A moment later, a petite Asian girl exitedrnthe gymnasium, smiling.xa0 This wasrnit.xa0 This was my moment of truth.xa0 Come on, I thought to myself.xa0 Just do a few back handsprings and call it arnday.xa0 I took a deep breath, and then letrnmyself into the gym. As I walked in, I tried not to lookrnanywhere near as nervous as I felt.xa0 Therncheerleaders sat at the front of the gym behind a long table.xa0 I glanced up and down the line, wondering ifrn– Holy shit.xa0 Oh my god.xa0 It was him.xa0rnHottie boy.xa0 And he was arncheerleader. My thoughts about hottie boy'srnsexuality were cut off by a remark from one of the blonde girls at the table. \"Tattoos are strictlyrnverboten.xa0 Sorry!\" she said, giving me arnbig, bitchy smile.xa0 I realized instantlyrnthat my semi-dredlocks and wallet chain didn't exactly fit in with theirrnperfectly uniformed cuteness.xa0 Well, ifrnthey wanted a bitch, they would get a bitch. Raising my left arm up towards myrnface, I sent her the biggest shit-eating smile I could muster.xa0 Slowly, I raised my middle finger and lickedrnit.xa0 I then used the moisture on myrnfinger to smear the ink on my \"tattoo.\" \"I got bored during fourth period,\"rnI said, as innocently as possible.xa0 Thernblonde girl and the Asian girl sitting next to her glared at me.xa0 The Asian girl picked up one of therncheerleading forms from the stack in front of her and held it up in the air. \"You need to fill one of thesernout,\" she said in a voice that implied that she was speaking to anrnexceptionally slow child. \"Did it.\"xa0 I cut her off with a smirk.xa0rnA dark haired girl sitting at the end of the table reached for it.xa0 As I handed it to her, she snatched it outrnof my hand.xa0 I watched as hottie boyrnleaned over to study my information.xa0 Irnfound myself wishing that he would memorize my phone number. \"Missy, is it?xa0 Before we start, I'm afraid we're going tornneed to make sure you can do a standing back tuck.xa0 Standard procedure.xa0 You understand.\"xa0 The brown haired girl looked like nothingrnwould give her more pleasure than to watch me fall on my ass trying.xa0 Well, I hadn't spent fourteen years of myrnlife doing gymnastics for nothing. \"Standing back handspring back tuckrnokay?\"xa0 I tossed my wallet out of myrnpocket and tried not to look at hottie boy, who was staring at me with whatrnlooked like shock on his face.xa0 Irnlaunched into a back handspring back tuck.xa0rnLike riding a bike, I thought as I landed the back tuck andrnre-approached the table.xa0 A quick glancernat hottie boy made my heart skip a beat as I saw the large grin spreadingrnacross his face. \"Where's this girl from, Romania?\"rnsnarled the blonde.xa0 Before I could makerna retort, she threw out her hands.xa0 \"Canrnshe yell?\" \"We'll try an oldie,\" said anotherrnblonde girl, who was sitting at the center of the table.xa0 Unlike the others, however, her tone wasn'trnlaced with hostility.xa0 She sat uprnstraighter and gave me a look that implied I was to repeat what she did. \"Like awesome!xa0 Oh wow!xa0rnLike totally freak me out!xa0 Irnmean right on!xa0 The Torros sure arernnumber one!\"xa0 She shouted with a volumernthat easily reached all the way across the school gym.xa0 I glanced up and down the row of faces,rnchecking to see if this was an elaborate joke.xa0rnI was actually supposed to say that without laughing? I took a deep breath and began tornyell, hoping to match her perkiness.xa0 \"Irntransferred from Los Angeles, your school has no gymnastics team, this is arnlast resort!\" I had to fight to hold in myrnlaughter at the sight of the cheerleaders' faces.xa0 Hottie boy looked like someone had just told him that Christmasrnwas cancelled.xa0 I figured I'd better sayrnsomething if I wanted to salvage any remaining hope of making the team. \"Okay, so I've never cheeredrnbefore.xa0 So what?xa0 How about something that actually requiresrnneurons?\" \"Do it,\" I heard the bitchy blondernmutter under her breath to the Asian girl, who turned to me and spoke. \"Front handspring, step out, roundrnoff, back handspring, step out, round off, back handspring, full twistingrnlayout,\" she finished with a flourish.xa0rnThe others at the table seemed to think she was insane.xa0 I could see hottie boy glaring at her, whichrnmade me feel really good about what I was about to do.xa0 I shook my head and laughed a little as Irnturned and walked towards the back of the gym.xa0rnAs I was walking, I realized that I couldn't really remember half ofrnwhat the Asian girl had said.xa0 It didn'trnreally matter.xa0 I would just unleash arnlittle bit and then see what they thought. Reaching the end of the gym, Irnturned so I was again facing the table, which seemed very tiny and farrnaway.xa0 I took a few steps and let myselfrnfall into the zone.xa0 I started with arncartwheel and went immediately into a front walkover, which I followed with arnback handspring.xa0 Turning around, I launchedrninto another cartwheel, followed by another back handspring.xa0 Going full out now, I tossed myself into thernair and executed a full twisting layout that would've made my old coachrnproud.xa0 I made sure that the smile wasrnmostly off of my face before I turned back so I was facing the table. Everyone appeared to be pleasedrnwith what I had done, with the exception, of course, of the blonde and thernAsian, who I was thinking of dubbing the Bitch Sisters.xa0 The nice blonde girl at the center of therntable was the first to speak. \"Missy is bank!\" she exclaimed,rnwhich I assumed from her tone was a high form of praise.xa0 Blonde Bitch Sister scoffed. \"Bankrupt!xa0 We've already so decided on Jamie.\"xa0 I could feel any last remnants of my smilernfading.xa0 There was bitchy, and there wasrnbeyond belief.xa0 I was beginning tornconsider running from the room and slashing some tires. \"Courtney, this is not arndemocracy.xa0 This is a cheerocracy.xa0 I'm sorry, but I'm overruling you.\"xa0 The blonde girl at the center of the table,rnI was beginning to figure, must be the captain.xa0 And I now had a name for Blonde Bitch Sister.xa0 Courtney.xa0rnWell, that sounded slutty. Speaking of Courtney, she did notrnlook happy with the sudden turn of events.xa0rn\"You are being a cheertator Torrance, and a pain in my ass!\" she yelled,rnstanding up.xa0 Asian Bitch Sister quicklyrnfollowed suit.xa0 The expression on herrnface said she was far from finished. \"We already voted.\"xa0 Courtney paused and turned towards me, anrnexpression of pure malice on her face.xa0rn\"Besides.xa0 Missy looks like anrnuber-dyke!\"xa0 Courtney burst intorngiggles, as did Asian Bitch Sister. I stood frozen for a moment,rnfeeling as if I had been slapped in the face.xa0rnWhat was I doing here?xa0 What forrna moment had made me think that I would find any friends in these types ofrnpeople?xa0 I bent down, grabbed my keysrnoff of the floor, and hightailed it out of the gym.xa0 By the time I got to my car, I was practically sprinting.xa0 I slammed the door and threw the car intorndrive, not even bothering to put on my seat belt.xa0 All I wanted to do was sit alone in my room. ******************************* An hourrnlater, I was feeling a little better.xa0 Irnwas laying on my bed playing with my Silly Putty and listening to a Nine InchrnNails CD.xa0 Cliff had wandered upstairsrnto harass me, but I had just told him to leave me alone.xa0 The funny thing is, he had actuallyrnlistened.xa0 Maybe school had brainwashedrnhim. Right asrnthe last notes of \"Closer\" finished up, I heard the doorbell ring.xa0 Rolling off of my bed, I exited my bedroomrnand started towards the stairs.xa0 Irnapproached them just in time to see Cliff answering the door.xa0 Oh well.xa0rnI decided that I had to pee, and headed to the bathroom.xa0 As I emerged from the bathroom, I overheardrna very familiar voice saying my name from outside the front hall. \"What thernhell?\" I muttered, heading downstairs.xa0rnAs I approached the door, I could see Cliff talking to Torrance, thernblond captain from my cheerleading tryout.xa0rnNow I was really confused. \"Is herrndrug dependency going to be a problem?\" Cliff said, obviously unaware that Irnwas approaching.xa0 My brother, therncomedian. \"Cliff.xa0 Shut up.\"xa0rnI turned to face Torrance and folded my arms, leaning against therndoorframe.xa0 \"What do you want?\" \"I want yournon the squad.\"xa0 Her sincerity was enoughrnto make me laugh. \"You're thernbest.xa0 They know it,\" sherncontinued.xa0 \"They just reject thernunfamiliar.\" I shook myrnhead.xa0 This had to end here andrnnow.xa0 \"Thanks but no thanks.xa0 I plead temporary insanity.xa0 See, I'm a hardcore gymnast.xa0 No way jumping up and down screaming 'Gornteam go!' is gonna satisfy me.\" \"Look,rnwe're gymnasts too, except no beam, no bar, no vault.\" Was thisrngirl deaf?xa0 \"Sorry, not interested.\" Irnturned and began to close the door, hoping Torrance would get the hint.xa0 However, the only thing the door slammedrninto was my brother, who didn't look like he was moving any time soon. \"What arernyou doing?\" I asked.xa0 If Cliff was evenrngoing to screw with me now… \"Nothing, Irnjust thought it was uh… interesting hearing Torrance's point of view,\" saidrnCliff, nodding at Torrance. Hang on arnminute. \"How do yourneven know her?\" \"We're oldrnfriends,\" said Cliff.xa0 Torrance rolledrnher eyes and looked back at me. \"Ever beenrnto a cheerleading competition?\" \"Oh, yournmean like a football game?\" I said, amused. \"No, not arngame.xa0 Those are like practices forrnus.xa0 I'm talking about a tournament.xa0 ESPN cameras all around, hundreds of peoplernin the crowd cheering…\" \"Wait,\"rnCliff interjected.xa0 \"People cheeringrncheerleaders?\" he asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"That'srnright!\" said Torrance, in a tone that matched his.xa0 \"Lots of people.xa0 Here'srnthe deal Missy.xa0 We're the shit, thernbest.xa0 We have fun, we work hard, and wernwin national championships.xa0 I'mrnoffering you a chance to be a part of that.\" I don'trnknow why, but something about the way she said it made me think.xa0 I stared down at the ground, trying torncollect my thoughts. \"Thinkrnabout it Miss!\" said Cliff, in his most annoying fake happy voice.xa0 \"I mean you get to wear sassy outfits, yournget to yell like you care about something!\"xa0rnLike I said, my brother the comedian. \"She's notrnthe cheering type,\" snickered Cliff, for Torrance's benefit I suppose.xa0 Something snapped inside my head.xa0 Screw him.xa0rnScrew the Bitch Sisters.xa0 Screwrnmom and dad for forcing me to move.xa0 Irnwould show everyone. \"You knowrnwhat?xa0 Count me in.\"xa0 As Torrance's face broke out into a grin, Irndecided that whatever I would have to endure for the next few months would bernworth it, if only for the look that I had just witnessed on my brother. ***************************************** \"Sorneveryone, this is Missy.xa0 Missy, this isrnthe squad,\" said Torrance, indicating towards the various cheerleaders groupedrnin front of me.xa0 I nodded, feelingrnfairly self-conscious.xa0 I'd realizedrnthis morning that I really didn't have anything in my wardrobe that qualifiedrnas cheerleading attire.xa0 I'd finallyrnsettled on some black warm-up pants that I used to wear over my leotard inrngymnastics.xa0 I'd initially put on arnblack sports bra on top, but then realized that there was no way I felt securernenough about myself to prance around with my stomach hanging out in front ofrnall of these strangers.xa0 Finally, I'drnthrown on a red tank top and rushed out of my house so I'd make it to practicernon time. Duringrnlunch that day, Torrance had given me my very own Rancho Carne Torros cheerleadingrnuniform, and attempted to explain some basic cheerleading rules to me.xa0 It was all very confusing. \"Missy,\"rnsaid Torrance, snapping me out of my thoughts, \"This is Darcy.\"xa0 She pointed to brown haired girl who hadrnbeen mean to me at my tryout the other day.xa0rnShe nodded at me without much interest. \"And thisrnis Whitney.\"xa0 Asian Bitch Sister. \"This isrnCourtney.\"xa0 I gave her my best glare. \"Casey.\"xa0 Slightly dopey looking. \"Les.\"xa0 Torrance had pointed out a tall, brownrnhaired guy, who, to my shock, gave me a wide grin.xa0 Hesitantly, I smiled back.xa0rnHe seemed nice. \"This isrnJan.\"xa0 I drew in a sharp breath asrnTorrance pointed out hottie boy.xa0rnJan.xa0 I liked that name. Torrancerncontinued her introductions, but I wasn't really listening.xa0 I was too busy studying Jan's arms, whichrnwere very accentuated by his white sleeveless shirt. \"Missy?\"xa0 I shook my head, snapping out of myrnreverie.xa0 Torrance was giving me herrnperpetually cheerful grin. \"You can gornsit down over there.xa0 We already warmedrnup before you got here, you can start doing warm-up exercises with usrntomorrow.xa0 We're just going to runrnthrough our main routine this year – well, as much of it as we have down rightrnnow – so you can get the feel for it.xa0rnThen we'll start to work on our more basic cheers and you can joinrnin.xa0 Okay?' I nodded,rnand walked across the floor to take a seat.xa0rnSimultaneously, I crossed my arms and my legs, feeling very, veryrnnervous.xa0 I watched the cheerleadersrngather into place.xa0 Well, the girlsrngather into place.xa0 The boys seemed tornbe occupied with standing around, stretching and looking manly.xa0 Mmm.xa0rnJan was looking especially manly.xa0rnA sudden outburst of yelling alerted me to the beginning of the cheer. \"I SAIDrnBRRR!xa0 IT'S COLD IN HERE.xa0 I SAID THERE MUST BE SOME TORROS IN THErnATMOSPHERE!\" I frowned,rnwatching the choreography that was accompanying their yelling.xa0 It looked familiar.xa0 Way too familiar. \"I SAID OHrnEE OH EE OH!xa0 ICE ICE BABY.xa0 OH EE OH EE OH!xa0 ICE ICE BABY.\" Music brokernout, but I wasn't about to stick around and watch the dance moves that Irnalready knew were coming.xa0 I grabbed myrnstuff and hurried out of the gym. As I walkedrnacross the parking lot, I had a moment of regret.xa0 This officially meant I would never, ever, get the opportunity torntalk to Jan ever again.xa0 But my momentrnpassed.xa0 I wasn't stupid enough to bernpart of a group that would mess with the kids from East Compton. As I wasrngetting into my Beetle, I heard the unmistakable sound of Torrance's voice,rnshrilling across the parking lot.","Summary":" A/N:xa0 This will bernMissy/Jan eventually.xa0 It's the wholernmovie, as told through Missy's POV.x","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  T - English - Romance  - Words: 4,415 - Reviews: 28 - Favs: 12 - Follows: 16 - Published: 3 24 2004 - id: 1788072 "},{"Movie":"Bring it On","Title":"My White Girl","Author":"DoubleDigits","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10159604","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Follow Jesse's standpoint during Bring it On: All or Nothing.

Seeing the want in both their eyes, she decided to make a quick exit. \"We'll talk later,\" she announced, slapping Cliff on the chest. \"Les!\" She grinned broadly and bounced over to the boy whose name she had just shouted. \"Hey, Miss!\" Les hugged the girl who flung herself against his torso. \"Second place feels pretty good, doesn't it?\" He looked down when she stiffened, and immediately noticed her stricken expression. \"Missy...?\" He gazed over her shoulder and saw Cliff and Torrance kissing passionately. \"Oh god...Miss, I'm sorry, I didn't see them...I didn't know. His arms tightened around her; part comfort, part protection. \"How are you?\" he asked softly, compassionately. \"It's okay,\" Missy replied huskily. \"As long as they're happy, it's okay...\" On the last word her voice cracked, and the first tears fell. Les smiled sadly, holding her closer, one hand holding her head to his chest and hiding her face from view. \"And if you keep telling yourself that, maybe someday you'll believe it.\"","Summary":" 3/3/06 - Status changed from in-progress to complete. title: Bring It On: Deleted Scenes 1 & 2 auth","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  K - English - Angst  - Words: 555 - Reviews: 24 - Favs: 14 - Follows: 2 - Published: 7 22 2002 - Status: Complete - id: 866748 "},{"Movie":"Bring it On","Title":"Time For a Party","Author":"Jaei","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149163","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Les entered the house with the swelled balloon of pride still alive in his chest: the finals had gone better than expected, the u-turn of fortune that had fallen on them since the disastrous spirit fingers episode a forgotten thing of the past. Jan and Les, good friends for all of high school, had been celebrating since noon, and a certain amount of alcohol had naturally been consumed in the mean time. Jan followed Les inside. The girls had been ditched at the after party, Torrence busy being serenaded by her new boyfriend and Missy, naturally, drinking to the early hours. Les's house was silent, his parents having left for a romantic retreat after the final show. \"You want a shower before you crash for the night?\" asked Les, eager to get to bed after the days festivities. \"Probably for the best, still got sweat on me from the show this morning! Man, my heads starting to throb a bit..\" Les laughed and headed to his bed, pulling his shoes and socks off whilst Jan disappeared into his en suite. Eventually the torrent of water was cut off. \"Mind if I come in to brush my teeth?\" asked Les through the door. After no answer, Les pushed the door open and traipsed in, before freezing mid step. Jan was scouring his hair dry with the towel, devoid of any covering save the sheen of water clinging to his body. \"Err, sorry.. I'll leave you too it big man.\" Jan laughed, \"Hah, I don't mind. You know you're my GBFF and all right? We can do anything around each other.\" Les snorted. \"GBFF? As in gay best friend forever? I suppose it wouldn't be right if the high school boy was devoid of his token queer pal, eh.\" Jan paused for a moment, before wrapping the towel around his waste and walking over to Les. \"You know, what happened these past few weeks.. what we achieved. It got me thinking. Thinking that change is good.. being honest is the way forward.\" Jan bit his lip. \"I wanted to tell you first.. as my GBFF and all..\" Les's stomach swooned unexpectedly. \"Are you coming out to me Jan? No way.. you spend way to much time accidentally slipping digits during lifts to speak fag.\" \"Hah, well not gay, no. Bisexual.\" \"Intriguing..\" Les tried, unconvincingly he thought, to hide his growing excitement. The calming balloon began to inflate once more. \"We're both guys.. Guys have different rules to normal couples right?\" He grinned, wrapping his fingers under the bottom of Les's shirt and lightly stroking the muscled stomach underneath. \"Plus we've been friends for a long time! We can do casual fucking can't we?\" Les's grin broke out into a full smile. \"Yeah.. we could totally do that! I mean.. yeah, that sounds pretty cool.\" Les smiled, his eyes soaking in the sight of Jan's ripped body in front of him. Taking a careful step forward, pulling his body into Jan, Les looked his best friend straight in the eye, staring into the colour and depth. Then slowly, he moved his head in close.. and kissed him on the mouth. A wave of emotions and, probably, hormones swept across Les's body, heading straight for his head and twitching cock. Jan smiled back, before pushing Les out of the bathroom and into the adjoining bedroom. They locked mouths again, this time tongues grappling whilst hands roamed over each others bodies. They parted heads and inhaled deeply, recovering slightly from the rush and the intensity of the moment. Jan pulled away and lifted Les's shirt off him, exposing his amazingly muscled body. Jan whistled to himself.. he had obviously seen his friend nude a thousand times (at least from the waist up), but had never before thought he would be able to touch it.. taste it. Moving close, he ran his tongue down Les's neck, drawing a sigh from the fellow cheerleader. Holding his waist, Jan ran his tongue down his collar to a hard nipple, before enveloping the bud in his mouth, sucking and tonguing. Les moaned in response, his cock aching to be out of his trousers. Meanwhile, Jan proceeded to bury himself on the other nipple, admiring the muscled large pecks they rested on. Les really did have the body of a Greek god.. he moved his kisses and nips down to Les's muscular stomach, running his tongue along the contours and ridges he found there before lapping at his navel and nuzzling in the trail of hair that lead so tantalizingly into the shorts below. Les rolled his head in pleasure, clinging onto Jan's hair whilst Jan worshipped the muscle in front of him. Jan hooked his fingers around the waist of the shorts and the elastic of the boxers below, before coming up for air and staring into Les's eyes once more. They kissed deeply, Jan shoving his tongue into Les's mouth and swirling it inside the warm depths. Finally, Jan pulled away, before looking down and slowly lowering the shorts and boxers.. Les sighed as his erection sprang out, whilst Jan stared on in wonder. He knew Les sported a rather large bulge, but seeing the prize in person filled him with awe. It was long and thick, nearly nine inches and wide with veins running along from base to tip. Jan dropped to his knees, before taking the whole thing into his mouth: he wasn't one for tantalizing foreplay taking up too much time, and the intensity of his need to have Les was getting the better of him. Les cried out in surprise, whilst Jan sucked at the large head before moving down the rock hard shaft, all the while palming and playing with the large balls hanging below. Jan sucked and licked the cock as best he could, although it was far too long for him to get very much in his mouth. He pulled it out his mouth with a pop before pumping the shaft, taking Les's balls in his mouth and sucking happily. Les tried his best to stay cool, although his knees started to shake out of the effort. He moaned and grunted whenever Jan took his cock in his mouth again, and twitched in pleasure whenever one of Jan's wandering hands moved up his six pack and tweaked a perk nipple. Just when he felt he was about to climax, Jan pulled off and kissed Les on the lips, letting him taste the pre cum on his tongue. Jan grabbed Les's hands and lead them to his towel, smiling as Les pulled the towel off. Les let out a rattled breath, before kissing down Jan's toned body and admiring the sight below. Jan had a great cock as well: not as long as his own, but beautifully thick with a neat garden of trimmed hair above. Les licked along the entire length before taking the fat head in his mouth, loving how much it filled his mouth: it really was the thickest cock he had ever seen (although, he had only slept with one person and sucked off another in the school gym changing room). Jan sighed and ran his hands over his body whilst Les worked, head bobbing back and forth as he gave Jan his first blow job from a man. \"Fuck, that's it,\" Jan gasped as Les sucked particularly enthusiastically on the head of his cock, \"Guys sure know how other guys like it eh.\" Not being able to take any more, Jan pulled Les up with his hands on Les's cheeks and pressed their naked bodies together, erections pushing against each others muscled stomachs. Jan pulled away and smiled.. before pushing Les onto his back on the bed. Les fumbled on his bedside table before grabbing a bottle of lube that he had hidden behind his alarm clock. \"You wanna.. go all the way?\" Les inquired, looking so hot staring up at Jan from the bed, his eyes filled with desire and excitement. \"Hell yeah\" replied Jan, \"let's do this properly\" he grinned. Moving up the bed with his arms and gently putting his weight onto Les's body, he gave Les's nipples another quick lick and pumped his large cock a few more times. Meanwhile, Les squeezed out a blob of lube and rubbed it in his hands to warm it before slathering it on Jan's fat cock. \"Mmm, damn that's cold.. feels nice\" laughed Jan, before pushing Les's muscular legs up and placing them on his shoulders. Les's now exposed toned ass faced Jan, who slicked two fingers and pushed them inside to loosen him the best he could. Les moaned as the fingers entered him, still not quite believing what was happening – and about to happen. \"Oh fuck, put your cock in me please!\" he moaned, eyes closed and biting his lip as the fingers worked inside him. Jan laughed and smiled, before finally pulling his fingers out and placing the head of his cock at Les's ass. \"You ready?\" he asked, holding onto Les's hips for support. \"Hell yeah buddy,\" Les replied, before yelling out loud as Jan began to push in. \"Oh shit.. fuck!\" Les squirmed as Jan pushed in inch after inch, his own cock pulsing rock hard with the feeling. Pain was the first thing he felt, the stinging to be expected with a cock as thick as Jan's. Jan kept pushing, slower but constant nevertheless. Meanwhile, Les continued to make the hottest noises as he was filled inside. \"Fuck, uhh.. don't stop. Little further Jan!\" He nearly yelled as Jan gave one final push, filling Les completely with his balls resting again his ass and stretching him to his limit. \"Fuck Les, that's one tight ass you have! I see why guys are always begging their girlfriends for anal now.\" Both teens panted with the heat, before Jan scooped Les's head in his hand and pulled them into a deep kiss as he began to thrust. Les moaned with every thrust, gripping the sheets and scrunching his face as Jan pushed in and out of his tight heat. Slowly he began to relax, breathing slower and more deeply as Jan panted above him, eyes closed at the pleasure of Les's tightness around his thick cock. Jan pulled nearly the entire way out of Les before slamming back in, their muscles rippling together as beads of sweat began to form all over Les's beautiful body. Jan gripped Les's large arms as he continued to plow into him, faster and faster as his balls slapped against Les's butt in rhythm. Jan cradled his head on Les's collar, gripping under his shoulders and pressing his face into the bed as he fucked Les as hard as he could, while occasionally capturing Les's mouth and roughly shoving his tongue inside. After a while he pulled out, Les whimpering from the sudden withdrawal. Jan pulled Les up and turned him around, pulling him onto his knees with his face against the wall and ass facing Jan's eager throbbing length. Jan quickly grabbed Les's ass and shoved his tongue inside Les before replacing it with his cock and pushing in, causing Les to yell in pleasure. \"Fuck! Shit, fuck me hard Jan I wanna cum harder than I ever have in my life.\" Jan grinned and licked Les's back before kneeling up straight, grabbing Les's hips and plowing into him as fast as he could. Sweat ran down his chest and he breathed heavier and heavier at the sound of Les's moans and grunts, while Les's cock bounced up and down with each thrust. Finally, Jan could take no more. \"Shit Les I'm gonna cum!\" \"Cum… inside\" Les barely made out between gasps of air, before moaning deeply at Jan's continual thrusts. Jan gave a few more thrusts before nearly screaming as he came, hot ropes of cum filling Les. Les moaned at the pulsing of Jan's cock inside of him, feeling him empty his large balls inside him. Eventually, Jan slowed until he collapsed on Les, his cock slowly losing hardness still inside Les's tight heat. Finally, Jan pulled out with a pop, Les moaning at the loss. Jan lay on Les's back panting heavily for a moment, before raggedly getting up and flipping Les over. \"We ain't done yet!\" he smiled, nipping Les on the lips before pumping his huge cock and taking the head into his mouth. It didn't take long to send him over the edge, Les shooting into Jan's mouth as he thrust into the warm heat. Jan collapsed next to Les, throwing an arm over Les's sweaty chest and wrapping a leg in between Les's own. \"I think we need to make a regular thing of this, don't you?\" joked Jan, while Les gave an exhausted laugh. \"You got that right.. here I was thinking I was the only gay on the cheerleading squad all this time!\" He grinned at the thought of being pounded by Jan on a regular basis from now on. \"Don't be silly.. there's no such thing as a straight male cheerleader.\" They both chuckled. \"You know… I think I'll be ready for round two quicker then I first thought. How about now?\"","LastChapter":"Les entered the house with the swelled balloon of pride still alive in his chest: the finals had gone better than expected, the u-turn of fortune that had fallen on them since the disastrous spirit fingers episode a forgotten thing of the past.

Missy had set up a plan, she would talkrnto the boys separate, she had phoned Jan and told him to get herernearlier. ------------------------------------------------------ Standingrnin front of the mirror, Jan looked at what he was wearing; he wasrnwearing a simple black shirt with the top three buttons undone and arnpair of black trousers, running a hand through his hair. \"Getrna grip man,\" he whispered to himself before tuning away from thernmirror and headed our of his room, he made his way downstairs andrngave his mum a small smile before picking up the car keys. Drivingrntowards Missy's house, he tapped on the steering wheel in time tornthe music, which was playing from the CD player. He was nowrnregretting telling Missy he would come to the party, he wasn't in arnparty mood, and he wasn't in the mood to see Les all over hisrnnewest boyfriend. It wasn't that he didn't like Les; it was thernfact that he didn't like Tim, the blonde happy blue eyes boy, whornwas replacing him day by day. Parking in Missy's drive way,rnhe smiled at Missy who was standing in the door way with her smile,rnand her hair in curls. Jumping out of the car he was meet by Missyrnwith a hug. Walking into the house, Jan was amazed how muchrnthe house was all party like, with flashing lights, a table full ofrndrinks and a table full of food, the two took seats in the livingrnroom facing each other. \"So what's this about?\" Janrnasked leaning back on the soft chair and folding his arms across hisrnchest. \"I just wanted a nice little chat,\" Missy halfrnlied, sure they were going to have a chat, but it wasn't going tornbe short and she doubted it would be nice either. It was going to berna hard hitting truth bringing chat about him and Les. \"Aboutrnwhat?\" Jan asked, smiling at Missy. \"Les…\" as soon asrnthe name had left her lips, Jan let out a loud sigh before jumping uprnand running both his hands over his head before turning back to facernMissy, \"Jan what is going on between you and Les?\" \"Nothing,rnnothing at all, hence the no talking,\" Jan explained, sitting backrndown, this time leaning forward and hiding his face in hisrnhands. \"Jan what is really going on…is it Tim do you notrnlike him?\" Missy asked moving from the chair and sitting on therncoffee table in front off Jan. \"No…how could anyone likernhim…he's so…gay,\" Jan explained, looking through hisrnfingers. \"Well for you're information so is Les,\" shernsmiled at him, hoping to get some reaction out of him. \"Yearnbut that's Les, and Les…well Les is…well…\" Jan stuttered,rnhis worlds mixing together and rolling other each other. \"Janrndo you have feelings for Les?\" Missy asked shocked at the wholernthing, she always thought Jan was straight; there where all thosernstories about him and Courtney. \"Of course I have feelingsrnfor him, he's my…I mean, he was my best friend,\" Jan explained,rnlocking his eyes with Missy. \"No, I mean do you fancy him,\"rnMissy didn't need an answer for this question, she could tell byrnhis eyes, the question made his eyes go wide and full of emotion, \"OhrnJan,\" she whispered pulling the guy into her arms. The two hadrntalked about Les and Jan's feelings for the next hour. Janrnexplained to her, that he had always been gay but unlike Les, he wasrnscared of his feelings, he was scared to tell people how he reallyrnfelt. He always had feelings for Les but was never sure how to tellrnhis best friend how he felt. The whole story with Courtney was also arncover up, they had done stuff together but he never felt anythingrnwhile itrnhappened. ------------------------------------------------------ Byrnthe time Les and Tim got to the party, it was already in full swing,rnand most people were already drunk. Tim clung onto like a lost sheep,rnhe had never met all his friends in one go and this was the firstrntime.

A week had gone by since the chickens has escaped Tweedy's farm. They had all adjusted to living without humans but the stressful moments they had on the farm were still remembered and talked about. But today those memories were still on the mind of one spunky and feisty hen. \"Hey Ginger… what are you working?\" Rocky asked he noticed her holding a pencil and notepad. \"I'm writing an autobiography on myself\" she explained, \"What's that?\" Babs asked \"What's that? What's that?\" said Mac before she laughed \"It's a story on your life, that's what it is\" she explained. Just then Rocky had an idea, \"Hey! Maybe when you're done…you can …read to us?\" said Rocky \"Sure thing\" said Ginger before Rocky, Babs and Mac left her alone to write. Ginger sighed and tried to figure out how to begin her story \"So much writing to do, so little time, I better get started\" she thought. \"What was the earliest memory I can remember?\" she asked herself, she thought long and hard but then an idea came to her. \"I got it! Seeing Mum for the first time, that should work\" Ginger said to herself. (Flashback) Before Ginger lived on the Tweedy's farm she spent the first few months of her life on the farm her mother lived on. One day on the Simmons's farm (the farm Ginger's mother live on) there was something taking place in Hut number 10. It was a month after spring started and most of the chickens started to have chicks, but this week most of the eggs had been lot by a fox attack. The 2 foxhounds that usually guard the chickens had gone with the farmer to town, leaving the chickens entirely unguarded. 2 fox brothers Scratchy and Becker had dug a hole under the fence and raided the coops. They took over eight chickens and several eggs, Ginger however survived the fox attack since her mother took the risk of protecting her coop and succeeded. The farmer returned home to find several of his chickens gone and feathers scattered on the yard, it was a shock to him. But he took drastic measures and set up humane traps through out his property incase the foxes might come back. It had been three days since the fox attack and most of the surviving eggs had started to hatch. In hut number 10 number 10 of the hens was waiting on hers, \"C'mon… that's it\" she encouraged. Finally it was over the chick rested for a few seconds before opening her eyes, \"Hi there…\" her mother said to her, the chick let out a small chirp. \"Oh, you are so cute\" her mother thought \"And feisty too\" she said as she looked over at her chick who tried not to fall in her attempt to stand up, but she failed and fell anyway. \"Gayle, come look at this!\" the mother shouted. Just then black hen with brown streaks in feathers ran in the coop, \"What is it Sandra?\" Gayle asked. She looked over at the nest and the chick resting in the hay, \"Oh… how cute!\" she said to Sandra \"Isn't she? She just hatched 2 minutes ago\" Sandra explained. Gayle was a chicken from Alabama, when Farmer Simmons's cousin came to visit him he brought Gayle to farm as a juvenile chicken she and Sandra quickly became friends that day. \"What are you gonna call her, anyway?\" Gayle asked, Sandra thought about it and finally came up with a name. \"Hmm… I think I'll call her Ginger\" she said to Gayle \"Ginger? I guess that would work out alright\" said Gayle before she left the coop. Sandra looked over at Ginger who was now asleep after a long day of being born. The next day, Ginger announced her existence when thehens in her mother's coop were woken up by her constant chirping. Sandra knew what it was and went to see about the problem, \"Ok, you win\" she said to Ginger before offering her some bird seed. She looked at Ginger who was taking the seeds into her beak and swallowing them, \"Hopefully today you'll learn how to walk\" said Sandra. She heard the gate open and Farmer Simmons's footsteps. He whistled for his 2 dogs to come, \"Kip, Skip\" he called. The 2 foxhounds came running and stopped right next to their owner. \"Do your stuff\" said Simmons, the 2 dogs nodded ad took off in opposite directions. They ran around the fence, barking instead of using an alarm to wake the chickens like the Tweedys, the Simmons let their dogs run around the fence and bark to wake the chickens up. At that moment the chickens started to get out of their coops after hearing the dogs bark. Simmons entered the yard and noticed Sandra wasn't there. \"What the…? Sandra's missing!\" he said \"What is it Logan?\" Brook asked from the kitchen window. \"Sandra's missing, I haven't seen her, this mourning\" Simmons yelled back. \"Try checking the coop…maybe she's in there\" Brook suggested before she shut the window, Simmons opened up the roof of the coop and found Sandra. \"So that's where you've been\" he said to her, he noticed Ginger who was fast asleep in the nest. \"Ah, you're a mother now… way to go old girl\" said Simmons as he petted Sandra. He closed the roof and left, Sandra sighed \"He's such a kind human\" she said to herself. She was right the Simmons were kind farmers, if anything involved their animals they handled it humanely. A short time later Ginger managed to take her first steps, \"Well look at you, walkin' already\" said Sandra. \"Shouldn't be long before you start talkin' huh?\" she added, Two days later Ginger was out on the yard for the very time as well as the other chicks. Ginger was one of 10 chicks that survived that fox raid, but thankfully Scratchy and Becker had been caught in one of the humane traps and were sold to a zoo. Ginger was so curious about the light and noises seen outside that she almost lost track of her mother. Simmons saw Ginger and picked her up, \"Well, would you look at that\" he said \"What's that?\" Brook asked. \"This is Sandra's chick, she 3 days old now\" Simmons explained. Brook looked at Ginger and smiled \"Well… she's awfully cute\" she replied. Just then she was alerted by Ginger's loud chirping, she laughed \"I think you'd better put her down\" she suggested to her husband. \"Alright… back with your Mum\" he said to Ginger as he placed her on the ground. To farmer Simmons seeing Sandra raising a chick was very pleasant, since all six of his own kids had grown up and left the house 3 out of the six already had kids of their own. But they all still came to visit their parents and were always at the family reunions every year. Weeks went by and Ginger was growing into nice looking young chicken. Her feathers started taking on the orange color her mother had, Ginger's feathers were now mostly orange. The soft yellow feathers from when she was a chick were now smaller amounts. Farmer Simmons watched as the chicks grew, he knew it wouldn't be long after these were old enough to leave their mother that the hens would be starting on a second brood. This time was critical for Ginger as well at the other Chicks on the farm. Since they were only a few months old and could possibly live on their own, in reality it was still too soon for them to leave their mothers. One day a white van pulled up to the farm drive way , \"What's that?\" Ginger asked \"The vet\" said Gayle \"The vet? What's a vet?\" Ginger asked. \"You'll find out\" said Sandra, at that moment the gate opened. \"Well, here they are\" said Simmons as he pointed to the group of partly grown chicks. \"Alright… we better get started then\" said the vet, one by one the partly grown chicks were taken to the van and given vaccines. Ginger was the last chick to be taken, \"Ok, last one\" said the vet Ginger whimpered at the feeling of the needle going into her wing. \"That's a good girl\" said Simmons, after Ginger was finished. \"I'm so sorry hen, I know that had to hurt… but it only lasts a few seconds\" he said to Ginger after placing her on the ground. He gave a little pat on the head which made her feel better, Sandra was Simmons favorite chicken he didn't have the heart to kill her when she would eventually stop laying eggs, he made a promise to himself that when she eventually stopped he would let her live out her life as well as the other hens on the farm. After the vet was gone he locked the gate and left. \"I hate shot… they hurt too much\" said one of the partly grown chicks. \"Pim, these were your first shots\" said Ginger, Pim was blue merle in color. (Blue merle looks like kind of gray with black spots) Pim had a sister and 2 brothers, originally her mother had six eggs altogether but the other two that would have been Pim's other siblings were lost in Scratchy and Becker's raid. Ginger didn't have any sibling's all any eggs that possibly would be related to her were gone, but by asking her mother she found out she was the first and only chick Sandra had. \"At least you won't have to get anymore until next year\" said Sandra. \"Really?\" said Ginger \"Sure… when the vet comes they ya all your shots for the year… and if you need more they come back\" Gayle explained. \"I see, but why do we get shots anyway?\" Ginger asked. \"They keep us from getting' sick… I got shots when I was your age\" said Sandra. \"What else happened when you were my age?\" Ginger asked once more, Sandra felt nervous but answered her daughter's question \"Someday, I'll explain it to you\" Sandra answered. Two weeks later something happened to Ginger that would change life unlike anything else she experienced on the farm. MORE TO COME… Well that's chapter one. I hope you liked it chapter two will be posted as soon as I can get it up. But please leave your reviews when you can. From Greendogg[Chapter 2] Here'snchapter 2 hopefully someone will review it soon. Twonweeks after the vet came to give out vaccines, things started tonchange on the Simmons's farm. Ginger and the other chicks were alln4 months old and had started to look more and more like theirnparents. Ginger was definitely like Sandra, not only in looks but innpersonality. Ginger noticed Brook and farmer Simmons placing an oddnlooking piece of metal on the ankle of one of the chicks. \"Mum,nwhat's going on?\" Ginger asked \"Brook's puttin' I.D. on…\"nGinger cut her mother off. \"What are I.D. bands?\" she asked, \"AnnI.D. band is how a human identifies us\" said Gayle. \"Don't theynrecognize us by the way we look and our names?\" Pim asked, \"Humansnwho don't know us or have never seen us…wouldn't recognizenanyway\" said Gayle. \"Gayle is right, if you ever get lost andnsome humans find you, they'll know where and who you belong to bynlooking at your I.D. bands\" Sandra explained. \"I get it, but howncome you aren't getting one?\" said Ginger, \"Oh, we're old…wendon't need I.D. bands, unless we were taken off the property\"nGayle answered. After all the chicks had been marked with I.D. bands,nSimmons looked at the chicks and sighed sadly \"What's wrong withnSimmons?\" Ginger asked \"He's a little depressed\" said Sandra.n\"About what?\" Ginger answered \"You'll find out soon enough\"nGayle replied. A fewnminutes later, pick up truck stopped in the farm's driveway, itnsparked the chicken's curiosity as well the two foxhounds Kip andnSkip. They saw the driver of the truck and barked at him angrilyn\"Easy…\" said farmer Simmons but the two dogs ignored him andnmoved closer to the driver \"Heel!\" Simmons yelled. The foxhoundsndid as they were told, and backed away from the driver, \"Who do younthink he is?\" Ginger asked. \"Obviously another farmer\" said Kipn\"Why would he come here?\" Ginger asked once more. \"I don'tnknow, but somthin' about him doesn't smell right\" Kip replied,n\"Well whatever he wants, he ain't gonna find it here\" saidnSkip. \"I'm here about your ad\" said the other farmer \"Ohnyes, Mr. Tweedy…they're right over here\" said Simmons. Henunlocked the gate and the two of them entered the yard. \"They'renthe looking ones I've got\" Simmons explained \"Well that'snthem\" he continued as he pointed to the group of partly grownnchickens. \"Wait a minute! What's going on!\" Ginger asked Kip,n\"I don't know, ya better be careful hen\" she said to Ginger.n\"I'll take the one of the left\" said Mr. Tweedy \"Ok, she'snall yours\" said Simmons. Ginger saw Mr. Tweedy reaching down tonpick her up, she took off running but Simmons quickly stopped her. Henlaughed, \"She's a quick one\" he said to Mr. Tweedy. Simmonsngave Ginger a little pat on the head then he placed back on thenground before he and Mr. Tweedy left the yard. \"Mum, what's goingnto happen to me? And why does other human want me?\" Ginger asked.nShe had become very nervous about the whole ordeal, \"I should haventold you a long time ago but I was too scared\" said Sandra. \"Toonscared of what?\" Ginger replied, Sandra sniffled as she wiped antear from her right eye. \"You're being sold\" she said, \"Sold?\"nGinger continued. It was confusing to her, \"Yes, sold… bought,npaid for, traded…given away, get yourself a dictionary!\" saidnKip. \"But…why would Simmons want to give me away?\" said Ginger,n\"Humans do that all the time, they do for a little thing theyncall…money\" said Gayle. \"What is that?\" Ginger asked, being anpartly grown chicken she didn't know that much about how humansnlived. \"It'sna material they us everyday, it comes in 3 types paper and metal andnalso a think called a check\" Kip explained. \"But humans need it,nmoney pays off bills and other things…includin' the chicken feednyou've been eatin'… it also pays for our dog food too\" Skipnadded. \"Wow, money must mean a lot to humans\" said Ginger,n\"Probably…they work for it\" said Skip. \"So that's whatntheses I.D. bands are for, they're \"for sale\" tags\" Gingernanswered \"You've got it\" Kip replied. \"But… I don't wantnto be sold, I want to stay here\" said Ginger \"Forget it Gingernyou're a day late and a carrot shot\" said Kip. Ginger had itnfigured out, she and the nine other chicks all had I.D. bands whichnindicated they were for sale. \"B-But Mum I don't want to go! Inreally want to stay here with you\" said Ginger. \"Now Ginger, calmndown… I left my Mum when I was your age and now you'll have tonleave soon… but I'll keep an eye out for you, just incase younshould happen to come back\" said Sandra. \"Thanks Mum\" saidnGinger who gave her mother a hug, several minutes later it lookednlike Ginger would be leaving soon. She and the others had seen Mr.nTweedy pay farmer Simmons. \"Well there you are…\" said Mr.nTweedy as he handed Simmons some dollar bills. \"Here's her shotnrecord… she'll need more next spring\" said Simmons. \"Surenthing\" Mr. Tweedy replied, he wanted to leave already and farmernSimmons had been talking to him for a long time. Simmonsnpicked up Ginger and looked at her straight in the face. \"Well,nGinger one… ready to go to your new home?\" Simmons asked. Gingernchirped, even though she was a partly grown chicken she still soundednlike a chick that was a few weeks old. \"Now Ginger, you gottanpromise me you won't escape…maybe you'll come back for a visitnsomeday, huh?\" Simmons said to her. \"Maybe\" said Mr. Tweedy whonthought Simmons was crazy to be talking to a chicken. Although at thensame time it didn't seem so crazy since Mr. Tweedy himselfnsometimes talked to his dogs. \"Well c'mon hen, let's go\" hensaid to Ginger. She whined and leaned on Simmons's leg, whilenlooking at him with sad pleading eyes. \"Ya poor thing\" he said tonher and gave Ginger one last pat on the head. Simmons sniffled hisneyes started to fill up with tears, \"I'm sorry girl, but you'rensold now\" he said to Ginger before placing her in a small woodenncrate full of hay. \"You be good, ok?\" Simmons said to Ginger asnhe gave her a final rub on the head. \"Well… I'll be seein'nya\" said Mr. Tweedy, \"Yes, Tweedy… take care now, you hear?\"nSimmons replied \"Will do\" Mr. Tweedy answered. Ginger looked outnof the window of the truck she hated to leave her home and hernmother. \"Kip, can you come with me?\" she asked \"Sorry o'lngirl but I can't\" she said to Ginger \"Please?\" Gingernwhispered. \"I cannot, I must stay… but remember Ginger ya gots tonbe brave\" Kip replied. \"Thanknyou, Kip… I'll miss you\" said Ginger, \"I'll miss you too,nlassie\" she answered. Kip also sniffled, \"Buh-bye\" she said tonGinger and walked away from the truck and over to Skip and farmernSimmons. Ginger began to sniffle \"I love you Mum\" she saidnquietly \"I love you too, Ginge… bye\" said Sandra whose eyesnwere filled with tears. \"Bye\" Ginger replied back, the trucknengine started up. Ginger took one last look at the farm, Kip, Skip,nGayle, Sandra and the Simmons. Mr. Tweedy stopped the truck andnwaited for another to go by before pulling off. Ginger noticed anrooster about the same color as her, it was her Dad… Rusty, henmanaged to bend down from the wall that blocked off the property andnhe and Ginger rubbed beaks. She andnher Dad had hardly spent time together but still Rusty loved her andnalso hated to see her leave. Ginger continued to watch the Simmonsnand everyone else from the rear view window of the truck, until theynwere completely out of site. Back at the farm everyone was still sadnabout Ginger leaving, Kip and Skip began howling in a very sad tone.nSimmons knew that Kip and Skip liked Ginger too, since he had seennthem play fighting with her in the yard. \"Maybe I shouldn't havensold her\" said Simmons, \"Ya had to, what were we going to do withnher anyway?\" said Brook. \"I don't know but…\" Simmons sighednsadly \"She's Sandra's daughter and her only one at that\" saidnSimmons. \"True, but now that I think about it there seemed to bensomething wrong with that Mr. Tweedy\" said Brook. \"Maybe you'renright Brook, I am cable of asking to have Ginger back\" Simmonsnreplied. \"Yes you are, after all Logan… we're her real owners\"nsaid Brook, \"Very true Brook…very true\" he replied. MORE TOnCOME… Chapter 3nis coming soon. Please leave a review I've been working on thisnseveral time today.[Chapter 3] NOTE: Chapter 3 is finally here! Nice to see I've gotten 1 review. But anyway here's the rest of the story. Ginger was now 40 miles away from home. She and Mr. Tweedy hardly made eye contact. She just sat in the crate with her feathers all fluffed up (most chickens and birds do that when they're sick or angry). She let out deep sigh, Mr. Tweedy looked at her. Ginger didn't turn around she was looking at the country side through the window. Mr. Tweedy thought Ginger might have been depressed so he tried to get over it \"Oy… Mrs. Tweedy's gonna kill me\" he said to himself. He whistled to Ginger who turned around, she cocked her head to the side like most birds do. She blinked twice, Mr. Tweedy didn't say anything he tried petting her. Ginger trembled as Mr. Tweedy stroked her back, although it did make her feel somewhat better. She stretched out her right wing and began preening herself. It took over 15 minutes to do but it felt good, she shook herself which caused her feathers to fluff up again. Then she finally settled down and went to sleep, a few minutes later, the truck stopped in a driveway. Ginger was still asleep but was quickly woken up by Mr. Tweedy slamming the door. \"Huh?\" she said to herself, she looked out the window of the truck and saw Mr. Tweedy walking towards a house. She also noticed a fence it didn't take her long to realize that she was on another chicken farm. \"So this is it, I'm on another chicken farm\" she said to herself. She put her back to the window and sat in her crate feeling very depressed. \"She's right over here\" said Mr. Tweedy \"Huh? What the..?\" Ginger stuttered. She looked out the window once more, once again cocking her head to the side. The truck door opened, Ginger whined nervously she didn't know what these people would do to her. She had been taken from her home and now she was on a different farm 40 miles away. \"Well, that's her\" said Mr. Tweedy, \"Well, I guess she's alright… we haven't had a Rhode Island Red in a long time\" said Mrs. Tweedy. She examined Ginger's body checking her feathers and everything else for faults thankfully she found nothing wrong with except that Ginger was a partly grown chicken that still had some her yellow feathers from birth mixed in her orange colored adult chicken feathers. \"She's a purebred too\" Mr. Tweedy added, \"You've got the shot records right?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked. \"Ye-yes\" Mr. Tweedy replied as he handed her a folder containing all of Ginger's information. Mrs. Tweedy looked at the folder then she looked at Ginger \"Alright, let's get this over with\" she said. She unlocked the gate to the yard, Ginger was nervous and whimpered as if to say: \"Don't make go in there… please?\" \"Don't give me that look, that's your place and I have mine\" said Mrs. Tweedy. Ginger looked at the yard, she didn't see any chickens at the moment all she wanted to do was go home if she had the chance. Mr. Tweedy placed her on the ground, Mrs. Tweedy was about to lock the gate but she noticed Ginger wasn't moving. \"Off you go then\" she said, Ginger didn't move. \"I said off you go\" Mrs. Tweedy continued but Ginger still refused to move. \"I said go…\" Mrs. Tweedy said to Ginger only now she was losing her patience. \"Go!\" she shouted, Ginger had enough of this she let out an angry squawk and tried to run but Mr. Tweedy caught her. \"Gotcha!\" said Mrs. Tweedy \"You tried to pull over on me didn't Ya? Well not today\" she said. Ginger was angry and started to flap her wings furiously in the process she hit Mrs. Tweedy in the face \"Ouch! Stop it!\" she said when she was out of Ginger's flapping range, she got a firm hold on her wings. \"Ok, set her down now\" said Mrs. Tweedy, \"With pleasure\" Mr. Tweedy replied before letting of Ginger. She landed on the hard ground and let out\"Oof!\" when she hit it. Mrs. Tweedy closed the gate causing a loud slam, then she locked it and left. \"Where am I now?\" Ginger asked herself as she wiped off the mud from her wings and feathers. \"Hi there!\" said another hen, Ginger screamed and jumped up \"Wow! That was quite a jump\" said the hen. \"You scared me\" said Ginger \"Sorry, you're new around here ain't, ya?\" The hen asked. \"Yes I am, I'm Ginger\" she answered \"Name's Mac\" said the other as they shook hands…er... wings. Just then another hen came up to Mac and Ginger. \"Mac, what's with all the noise? I…who's this?\" the hen asked. Mac looked at Ginger but still she answered \"Oh, her? This is Ginger\" she said. \"Hi, I'm Babs\" said the other hen as she shock hands with Ginger. \"Hey there I… you knit?\" Ginger answered she noticed Babs was holding some needles and yarn in her left wing. \"Yeah, me mother taught me\" Babs explained, hearing that word brought the sadness of leaving home back to Ginger's mind. She sighed sadly, \"My mother taught me some things too\" said Ginger who let out a small sob. \"What's all this? I thought we were… who's this?\" Another chicken asked. Seeing that Ginger wasn't ready to say anything yet Mac explained it. \"That's Ginger\" she answered \"Yeah, she's new here\" said Babs \"Oh, I see, so Ginge you're our newest pullet here, huh?\" said the other Chicken. \"Yeah I guess so\" said Ginger, she looked at the ground feeling very sad. She slightly sniffled and her eyes filled up with tears but she fought the urge to cry. \"What's the matter?\" Mac asked \"I… its nothing\" Ginger replied, \"No it isn't, c'mon you can tell us\" said Mac she looked at the other hens and pullets. (Pullets are partly grown hens cockerels are partly grown roosters just incase anyone needs to know). \"Right guys?\" Mac said to the others, no one answered \"Guys!\" she shouted, this time the other chickens heard her and they all agreed. \"Ya see?\" said Mac \"Alright, I miss my old home and I miss my Mum\" said Ginger. Mac started to feel sorry for Ginger since she also wasn't home anymore. \"I see what you mean… I too miss me mother, the very first thing I saw when I opened my eyes\" said Mac. \"Same here, when I was born all I new is wherever I was, I felt cold and wet but then I saw her and it made things seem a lot better\" Ginger explained. \"I guess in one way or another we've all our moments with our mothers\" said the pullet who turned out to be Bunty. \"Aye, Bunt… we have\" Mac said to her. After hearing this Ginger started to feel a bit more comfortable, \"How long have you all been here?\" Ginger asked. \"Only a week, we were all bought and paid for\" Mac explained \"For what?\" Ginger continued. \"The farmer here needed some new chickens, all the old ones are…well… gettin' old\" said Mac. \"I heard that!\" said a Plymouth Rock hen, \"Keep your feathers on Frances!\" Mac shouted back. \"Sheesh! thought Mac \"Don't pay her any mind, she's lived here all of her life, won't be long before she'll wind up in some sort of trouble\" said Mac. \"Trouble? What kind of trouble?\" Ginger answered. \"Well, it's not my place to say it but… she's gotten into trouble for escapin' and the farmers really hurt her once\" Mac explained. \"Well why would she want to escape? I mean…\" before Ginger could finish her sentence the chickens were alerted by a loud alarm. \"Uh-oh\" said Mac, \"What do you mean uh-oh?\" Ginger asked \"Oh, I forgot, you're new here…its time for roll call\" Mac answered. \"What's roll call?\" Ginger replied she noticed the other chicken running to get in line. \"Roll call is when they count us to see how many eggs we've laid during the week\" said Bunty. \"But, I haven't laid an egg in my life\" said Ginger who stood next to Bunty. \"Well nether have I, we're all still pullets it'll be sometime before we start that's wha…\" Bunty stopped short when she heard the gate open \"Psst, get in line quick!\" she whispered to Ginger who did what she was told. The Tweedys walked in as usual, checking the record list for the week. \"Hmm… no one's been called out\" Mac said quietly, \"Called out for what?\" Ginger asked. She had to lean off to the side in order to talk to Mac since Ginger was standing between Bunty and another hen. \"Shh\" said Bunty who noticed Mrs. Tweedy coming turning around and coming back to starting end of the line up. She checked the clip board that listed all the chickens. Instead of listing the hens by name like farmer Simmons did, she had them listed by number. When she found a number with a line marked blank it didn't take long for her to find the hen that matched it. \"Eep! Not Lynn, oh please don't take Linny\" Mac said quietly. \"Take her where?\" Ginger whispered \"Just watch, you'll find out\" Bunty replied, Ginger was puzzled by this back at her old home they didn't have a roll call. The hen that had been picked out was a 2 year old tan colored hen named Lynn. She had amber eyes and wore a red bandanna, like Frances she grew up on Tweedy's farm from the time she was born. Mrs. Tweedy picked her up by the neck Lynn hated that so much she squawked and started flapping her wings furiously like Ginger did to Mrs. Tweedy. \"Stop it! I said Stop it, Mr. Tweedy!\" she yelled \"Yes, love?\" he asked \"Ouch! Tape up her wings, ouch! Now!\" said Mrs. Tweedy who was trying to keep Lynn's wings from hitting her face. \"I'm on it\" Mr. Tweedy replied all the hens including Ginger starting snickering. \"Shut up you\" he said to them, immediately they stopped. Mr. Tweedy refused to be humiliated by a bunch of chickens. He taped up Lynn's wings with duct tape \"Alright, done\" he said \"Good, let's go\" said Mrs. Tweedy. Mr. Tweedy slammed the gate behind them. \"Where are they taking her?\" Ginger asked. \"Didn't I tell you to watch? Take it from o'l Bunty, even though I've been here a week, we've seen things you haven't\" Bunty explained. \"I understand, sorry\" said Ginger. They heard a door open, Mrs. Tweedy picked up an ax. Lynn started squawking then she let out a sort of screech, the last thing the chickens heard was a loud thump. They all gasped after hearing the sound, they knew what had been done, except for Ginger. \"What did they do to her?\" she asked \"Ginger, you don't want to know\" said Bunty. The hens started to get out of their line ups and move to other parts of the yard. \"Isn't she coming back?\" Ginger asked she noticed the Tweedys locking the gate. \"No Ginge, she's not comin' back\" said Mac \"You mean she's…\" Ginger stopped short. Mac nodded, Now Ginger knew what happened she gulped. \"But…why would they do that?\" she asked. \"Cause she stopped layin' that's why\" said Frances. \"What?\" said Ginger, Frances rolled her dark blue eyes in the opposite direction. \"Alright, since you're new I'll make it nice and simple for you\" said Frances. \"Ya see, here we lay eggs, every single day… the humans take them and sell them in town\" Ginger cut Frances off. \"So what's wrong with that?\" she asked \"Let me finish\" Frances said firmly \"Sorry\" Ginger answered \"Ok…so, when we can't lay any more one of get taken into that room over there, known as the chop\" Frances explained. \"What do they do to you in there?\" Ginger asked, \"Somethin' nether one of us would want to witness\" said Frances. Ginger gasped, \"Yep, after that ya get plucked, sometimes stuffed… and roasted in an oven\" Frances continued. \"You mean they actually eat…chickens?\" Ginger replied, \"I'm afraid so\" said Frances. \"But my humans never did that or if they did they did it out of site, that's what Kip told me\" said Ginger. She was right if the Simmons had to have one of their chickens taken for any reason they had someone else do it they NEVER did it themselves. \"Who's Kip?\" Bunty asked \"She's a dog\" Ginger answered. \"Dog?\" all the hens asked then they began to laugh, \"Well, she is\" said Ginger who felt embarrassed that one of her friends was a foxhound. \"You mean to say you actually believe something a dog would say to you?\" Bunty asked. \"Well…yes\" Ginger replied, \"Ginger I know we're low in the food chain but, c'mon a dog? Why would you listen to a dog?' Bunty continued. Ginger couldn't take it anymore, \"Cause the dogs weren't there to protect us from foxes, that why!\" she shouted. All the hens gasped, \"Foxes? Since when have you seen foxes?\" Bunty asked. \"I've never seen a real one, just pictures but… my mother told me before I was born the farmers went go into to town they dog took the dogs with 'em and… some foxes dug a hole under the fence and attacked us\" Ginger explained. \"But, how did you survive? I mean if this happened before you were born then… what kept you from getting caught?\" Bunty asked. \"My mother took the risk of defending me and succeeded\"Ginger replied \"Wow! Talk about guts… I never would have done that\" said Mac. Ginger smiled and blushed \"Thanks, but you see I'm her only daughter and… the first chick she's ever had so… I can see why she would defend me\" said Ginger. \"Well sure, all mother protect their young, I've defended my nieces and nephews before and… it's very rewardin' to do somethin' nice, for… someone else\" said Frances. \"Frances? Did you ever have any chicks of your own?\" Ginger asked, \"Me? Oh no I don't think I will… and you?\" she asked Ginger. \"Well I…\" Frances cut her off \"I'm just kidding\" she said with a laugh. \"You're still a pullet, you got a lot to learn about motherhood\" said Frances. \"That's true but what's it like?\" Ginger replied, \"Well, I helped my sister raise my nieces and nephews\" said Frances. \"What was that like?\" Ginger asked \"Oh, very enjoyable yet tiring all at the same time\" said Frances. \"Why would you say that?\" Ginger continued, \"Hey! You try raisin' 9 nieces and nephews and see how you hold up\" Frances replied. \"For the next 3 weeks or so, I spent nights and weekends watchin' 'em, by the time they were all bought and sold by different people I was so sleepy instead of countin' sheep I was countin' sleep\" Frances explained. (The \"I was so sleepy\" line is from a TV series called everybody hates Chris) All the hens laughed, \"But Ginger seriously, if you don't want chicks don't have 'em, just a word of advice\" said Frances. \"Well I don't know… I wouldn't even how to find a rooster to begin with\" said Ginger. \"Well, I could offer you one of my nephews, he lives just up the road\" Frances replied. \"Only kiddin' \"Frances continued with a laugh. \"Besides at your age it's not good for you to have chicks, did your mother ever tell you that?\" Frances asked. \"Yeah she did, its because I'm not mature enough to take care of one\" Ginger replied. \"Not only that, but your body isn't mature enough ether, if tried havin' a chick now, you could possibly get really sick I've known pullets who who've had chicks and have gotten really sick\" Frances explained. \"What's happened to them?\" Ginger replied \"They got better eventually but some of their chicks were born premature cause they were born ether too early or somethin' else happened to cause 'em to be like that\" said Frances. \"But, what would be considered premature?\" Ginger asked once more \"Oh, lots of things… improper growth of feathers and several other things including size, some premature chicks are pretty small once they're born\" Frances replied. \"I know that, I knew a chicken who was almost premature but instead she turned out to be a runt\" Ginger explained. \"I know what's that like I'm a giant runt between me and my 4 sisters and 3 brothers I was the biggest out of all 'em\" said Frances, \"Wow\" said Ginger. (Giant runts are animals that are usually larger then average size). \"Hey! Did you forget us! C'mon let's do somethin' else for a change\" said Mac. \"Right\" said Ginger, she and Frances had been caught up in talking so much that they had lost track of everybody else. \"C'mon Ginge let's go\" said Frances who laughed. \"I don't want to miss my favorite show\" she continued, \"What show?\" Ginger asked \"Ohh, don't worry you'll see\" Frances answered. \"Kay\" Ginger replied, a few minutes later the chickens had gathered by the fence. \"Are you all set Mac?\" Frances asked \"All set Frances\" Mac replied. She gave Mac the signal to fire the slingshot \"1…2…3…go!\" at hearing go Mac did just that. What she was firing was a tin can with some of Babs' yarn tied to the back. The yarn had become tangled in the Tweedy's clothesline and the can sat right on the living room window sill. The other can was hanging over the chicken's side of the fence. \"Ok it's all set now, we wait and listen\" said Mac, \"Listen for what?\" Ginger asked. \"Shh keep it down\" said Mac \"Now we move on to viewing\" she continued. She and some of the other pullets began setting up binoculars and a telescope. \"Ok everybody come look!\" said Mac \"What are we doing?\" Ginger asked \"Shh! Listen\" Mac replied. They could see and hear Mrs. Tweedy! \"If that chicken tries to test me one more time… ohhh! She's gonna get it and get it good\" she said to Mr. Tweedy. Mac gasped \"I think she means you Ginger\" she said \"Well, what did I do? I don't like those humans\" Ginger answered. \"One thing I learned not to do is, don't let your wings slap 'em in the face they hate that and it's not a good thing to do ether\" Frances explained. \"Why?\" Ginger asked \"Because they could kill you!\" said Frances. Ginger gasped at the thought of it, \"O…Kay now let's get back to the show\" said Mac. \"You mean eavesdropping\" said Ginger, Mac didn't say anything. \"But… she's only been about an hour\" said Mr. Tweedy, even though he didn't give the chickens the type of respect they deserved he secretly that Ginger should adjust before anyone could draw any conclusions. \"I don't care, she needs to learn her place like the other ones even if I have to force her to\" said Mrs. Tweedy. \"Wouldn't that qualify as animal cruelty?\" Mr. Tweedy asked. \"Are you questioning me, Mr. Tweedy?\" his wife asked, he gulped \"Nevermind\" he said. \"I thought so\" Mrs. Tweedy replied, before walking in the opposite direction. \"You picked up the dry cleaning today, right?\" she asked \"Uh…no\" Mr. Tweedy replied. \"Fine, we'll get it tomorrow\" she replied with a sigh \"If you didn't put me under pressure I wouldn't have forgotten it\" Mr. Tweedy said to himself. \"What was that!\" Mrs. Tweedy asked as she quickly got up from her desk. \"Nothing, love\" Mr. Tweedy replied he smiled at her nervously, she gave him an angry looking stare then she stopped and sat back down. There was something about her facial expressions that made Mr. Tweedy nervous. He always felt uncomfortable when he had to look her in the eye, (Her blue eyes). \"Ohhh, no she didn't!\" said Mac who rolled over laughing, \"Why did she look at him like that?\" Ginger asked. Mac managed to stop laughing to tell her, \"That look mean you better get it right before I knock the wax out of your ears\" Mac explained(Yet another line from everybody hates Chris). The chickens started to snicker within a few seconds it turned into full fledged laughter. \"I'm telling you, she doesn't play\" said Mac \"That's an understatement\" said Ginger, who also laughed. Even though she was far from home now that she had some new friends maybe things wouldn't be so bad after all. MORE TO COME…. Well that's chapter 3. I worked on it all week, chapter 4 will be published next week I'm going out town this weekend and will have the story updated when I get back. But please leave your reviews on what you think of the story so far.[Chapter 4] Hey folks, I know I haven't updated in a long time. Mostly because I've been working on other stories. A lot has happened since I last updated. When my desktop went out I got a laptop after that which is easier for me since I can take it with me and continue working on my writing. The notebooks I used when I started writing Every dog has it's Day or Chicken Run Biography are in a box with my other writing related supplies. I moved and still have boxes I haven't unpacked, so those books are more than likely in a box out in the garage. For anyone wondering if I'll finish these stories, I will eventually but right now they're still on hiatus. Also, I can't reply to anonymous reviews, in order for writers to reply, the reviewer needs to have an account. And if anyone asks if the Tweedys have kids at the end of Every Dog Has It's Day, Sorry to disappoint those who were hoping for that but that's not what I planned when I developed the storyline. But I did come up with happy endings for both Chicken Run Biography and Every Dog Has Its Day. So, no worries. I appreciate that people are still reading, reviewing and adding these stories to their favorites' lists. Thank you. I've got other stories and projects that I'd like to work on before coming back to these. I've also been in a bit of a rut too which makes it hard for me. I'm still working on getting out of that so I can get back to writing regularly like I used to. Anyway, thanks for stopping by.

You are late, again!\" Mrs. Fowler growled at Cliff from her position at the blackboard. \"Yeah, I am sorry! I had some stuff to do.\" Cliff apologised, as he slid into his seat next to Torrance.[Chapter 2] Torrancenopened her humungous closet. She was lucky to have a friendnlike Darcy who had a generous dad. Darcy, Casey, and Torrance had allnmoved in together, after Darcy's dad had bought her a 5-bedroomednmansion just around the corner from the college. Torrance's bedroomnwas huge, overlooking the local park. It was painted a bright, zingynpink, and her duvet was a deep purple. Her walk-in closet was so bignyou could practically class it as a bedroom itself. \"Hmmm.\"nTorrance thought to herself. What should she wear? Her eye caught hernold Ranche Carne cheerleading uniform, its bright red triggeringnloads of memories. But she couldn't wear that to a party! No, shenpicked out a short white mini-skirt, and her white high heelednsandals, and decided on her black halter-neck top to top off herncasual, yet sophisticated look. She slipped on her clothes, andnlooked in the mirror. \"AHHH! My hair!\"nher hair was a complete mess, and she only had half an hour to do it.nSo she got to work, styling. She decided to curl it, and put it in anside parting so she could clip part of it back. She added somenperiwinkle blue eyeshadow, which she knew complimented her eyes, andnadded some of her new sparkling lip gloss. She looked perfect, andnshe hoped Cliff would think so too. She grabbed her silver handbag,nplaced her phone in, and her lip gloss. She checked the mirror onenlast time, and then rushed down the stairs. To her surprise, shenfound Darcy in the lounge, studying. \"Hey, Darcy,naren't you coming to the party?\" Torrance questioned, and satndown on the edge of the sofa. \"Don't.Even.Ask.\"nDarcy growled. \"I have to study for this stupid test, when Incould be out partying, I hate Math!\" \"Geez, it's anhard life!\" Torrance laughed. \"Where's Casey?\" \"Oh, I thinknshe's out with her boyfriend.\" \"Casey has anboyfriend? Aww that is so cute!\" Torrance said, smiling at thenthought of it. Suddenly the doorbell rang. \"I know!\"nDarcy replied. \"Anyway, I havento go, OK?\" Torrance waved, grabbed her front door keys from thenshelf and opened the door. \"Hey.\" Cliffnsaid. \"Woah, you look beautiful!\" \"Thank you, younlook great too!\" Torrance smiled at her handsome boyfriend, andnclimbed into the car. \"Erm, Tor, do younknow where the party actually is?\" Cliff grinned playfully, asnhe made his way out of the driveway. \"No! I thoughtnyou knew!\" Torrance giggled. \"What are we going to do?\" \"Well....seeingnas we can't find the party, why don't you just sit tight and I'llnfind some other place for us to chill out?\" \"But....Cliff...\"nTorrance smiled. Her boyfriend always had good ideas up his sleeve,nshe wondered what he was planning. She tucked a stray bit of hairnbehind her ear, and leant back in her seat. \"No buts...nTor... no buts...\" Cliff leaned over and kissed her. \"You plannednthis, didn't you?\" Torrance leant forward, with a playful,nsuspecting face. \"Now, MissnShipman, why would I do a thing like that?\" Cliff laughed as henpulled out onto the main road. \"Hmmm, I wonder.\"nTorrance said sarcastically. Giggling she reached over and turned thentape player on and 'Just What I Need' started up. \"Oh, have Inever told you how much I love this song?!\" \"Well, you shouldnseeing as I wrote it for you, and about you.\" Cliff replied,npulling to the side of the road. \"You know, Tor, I meantneverything I said in that song, you really are my everything.\" \"Aww, Cliff, comenhere.\" Torrance leant over and he wrapped her up in an intimatenhug which seemed as thought it lasted for ever. As they pulled away,nCliff couldn't resist kissing Torrance's cute little nose. \"Oh, and Cliff, Indidn't really want to go to that party anyway!\" Torrancenlaughed, but was silenced with a long, romantic kiss from Cliff. \"Torrance can benso naïve sometimes.\" Missy laughed to Jan as they droventhrough Mr. Frosty downtown. \"Aww, she can benkinda sweet.\" Jan replied, pulling into a parking bay. \"What, so youndon't think I'm sweet?\" Missy said, pouting. \"Come on, Miss, Inthink you're sweet, cute, beautiful, what more do you want?\" Jannsmiled and hugged her. \"But I don't even think I would fall fornthat trick! I can't believe Cliff made the party up so he couldnpropose.\" \"I know, beingnthat romantic is kinda unlike my brother.\" Missy laughed. \"It'snabout time though they have been together for, like ages!\" \"Yeah.\" Jannreplied, handing Missy her Vanilla ice cream. \"Do you thinknyou'll get married one day?\" \"I dunno.\"nMissy replied. \"Hopefully.\" \"Oh, this is anbit off the subject, but do you remember that necklace we saw thenother day in the mall?\" \"What, the onenwith the two hearts like intertwined at the bottom?\" \"Yeah.\" Jannsaid, nodding, leaning over and opening his glove box. \"Here, umn, I bought it for you.\" \"Jan! It'snbeautiful!\" Missy smiled as she opened the blue velvet box,nfinding the diamond necklace sparkle. \"I had itnengraved to, see?\" Jan said, carefully pointing to one of thenhearts, where one said Jan and the other said Missy. \"I justnwanted to tell you how much I love you.\" \"Jan, I don'tnknow what to say, it's perfect. I don't know what I would do withoutnyou.\" Missy leaned over and gave Jan a passionate kiss, whichnjust confirmed everything they both had said. \"Cliff, where arenwe going?\" Torrance asked as Cliff drove down through a desertednroad. \"I thought younwould have guessed by now.\" He pulled into a parking bay, andnsuddenly Torrance realised they were at thenbeach. It looked stunning in the evening twilight, and there was notnanother soul in sight. \"Well, what donyou think?\" Cliff said, as he turned off the engine, and joggednround to open Torrance's door. \"It looks ...nbeautiful.\" Torrance took Cliffs hand, and stood up. They walkedndown the wooden board walk, and sat down in each others arms, sharingntheir body heat. \"Tor, the reasonnI brought you here, was I know you like it here...\" \"I love it here.\"nTorrance turned, and gave Cliff a reassuring smile, before turningnher head and resting it on his chest. \"Well, I love younwith all the love in my heart, you're my everything you know...?\"nCliff struggled to find the words, and became even more nervous. \"...Inwant to be with you forever, for you to have my children, for us tongrow old together. Just seeing you or hearing your voice makes mensmile, and your touch makes me feel complete. I don't know, I guessnI feel like we were just made for each other.\" Cliff leant down,nand saw Torrance crying, silently smiling through her tears. \"And,n...will you marry me? Torrance noddednthrough her tears, as she was too touched to form words, and wasnimmediately swept up into a long kiss with Cliff hugging her as if henwould never let go. \"Oh Cliff, I lovenyou so much.\" And the couple stayed wrapped up on the beach untilndawn.","LastChapter":"Torrancenopened her humungous closet.

She decided to curl it, and put it in anside parting so she could clip part of it back. She added somenperiwinkle blue eyeshadow, which she knew complimented her eyes, andnadded some of her new sparkling lip gloss. She looked perfect, andnshe hoped Cliff would think so too. She grabbed her silver handbag,nplaced her phone in, and her lip gloss. She checked the mirror onenlast time, and then rushed down the stairs. To her surprise, shenfound Darcy in the lounge, studying. \"Hey, Darcy,naren't you coming to the party?\" Torrance questioned, and satndown on the edge of the sofa. \"Don't.Even.Ask.\"nDarcy growled. \"I have to study for this stupid test, when Incould be out partying, I hate Math!\" \"Geez, it's anhard life!\" Torrance laughed. \"Where's Casey?\" \"Oh, I thinknshe's out with her boyfriend.\" \"Casey has anboyfriend? Aww that is so cute!\" Torrance said, smiling at thenthought of it. Suddenly the doorbell rang. \"I know!\"nDarcy replied. \"Anyway, I havento go, OK?\" Torrance waved, grabbed her front door keys from thenshelf and opened the door. \"Hey.\" Cliffnsaid. \"Woah, you look beautiful!\" \"Thank you, younlook great too!\" Torrance smiled at her handsome boyfriend, andnclimbed into the car. \"Erm, Tor, do younknow where the party actually is?\" Cliff grinned playfully, asnhe made his way out of the driveway. \"No! I thoughtnyou knew!\" Torrance giggled. \"What are we going to do?\" \"Well....seeingnas we can't find the party, why don't you just sit tight and I'llnfind some other place for us to chill out?\" \"But....Cliff...\"nTorrance smiled. Her boyfriend always had good ideas up his sleeve,nshe wondered what he was planning. She tucked a stray bit of hairnbehind her ear, and leant back in her seat. \"No buts...nTor... no buts...\" Cliff leaned over and kissed her. \"You plannednthis, didn't you?\" Torrance leant forward, with a playful,nsuspecting face. \"Now, MissnShipman, why would I do a thing like that?\" Cliff laughed as henpulled out onto the main road. \"Hmmm, I wonder.\"nTorrance said sarcastically. Giggling she reached over and turned thentape player on and 'Just What I Need' started up. \"Oh, have Inever told you how much I love this song?!\" \"Well, you shouldnseeing as I wrote it for you, and about you.\" Cliff replied,npulling to the side of the road. \"You know, Tor, I meantneverything I said in that song, you really are my everything.\" \"Aww, Cliff, comenhere.\" Torrance leant over and he wrapped her up in an intimatenhug which seemed as thought it lasted for ever. As they pulled away,nCliff couldn't resist kissing Torrance's cute little nose. \"Oh, and Cliff, Indidn't really want to go to that party anyway!\" Torrancenlaughed, but was silenced with a long, romantic kiss from Cliff. \"Torrance can benso naïve sometimes.\" Missy laughed to Jan as they droventhrough Mr. Frosty downtown. \"Aww, she can benkinda sweet.\" Jan replied, pulling into a parking bay. \"What, so youndon't think I'm sweet?\" Missy said, pouting. \"Come on, Miss, Inthink you're sweet, cute, beautiful, what more do you want?\" Jannsmiled and hugged her. \"But I don't even think I would fall fornthat trick! I can't believe Cliff made the party up so he couldnpropose.\" \"I know, beingnthat romantic is kinda unlike my brother.\" Missy laughed. \"It'snabout time though they have been together for, like ages!\" \"Yeah.\" Jannreplied, handing Missy her Vanilla ice cream. \"Do you thinknyou'll get married one day?\" \"I dunno.\"nMissy replied. \"Hopefully.\" \"Oh, this is anbit off the subject, but do you remember that necklace we saw thenother day in the mall?\" \"What, the onenwith the two hearts like intertwined at the bottom?\" \"Yeah.\" Jannsaid, nodding, leaning over and opening his glove box. \"Here, umn, I bought it for you.\" \"Jan! It'snbeautiful!\" Missy smiled as she opened the blue velvet box,nfinding the diamond necklace sparkle. \"I had itnengraved to, see?\" Jan said, carefully pointing to one of thenhearts, where one said Jan and the other said Missy. \"I justnwanted to tell you how much I love you.\" \"Jan, I don'tnknow what to say, it's perfect. I don't know what I would do withoutnyou.\" Missy leaned over and gave Jan a passionate kiss, whichnjust confirmed everything they both had said. \"Cliff, where arenwe going?\" Torrance asked as Cliff drove down through a desertednroad. \"I thought younwould have guessed by now.\" He pulled into a parking bay, andnsuddenly Torrance realised they were at thenbeach. It looked stunning in the evening twilight, and there was notnanother soul in sight. \"Well, what donyou think?\" Cliff said, as he turned off the engine, and joggednround to open Torrance's door. \"It looks ...nbeautiful.\" Torrance took Cliffs hand, and stood up. They walkedndown the wooden board walk, and sat down in each others arms, sharingntheir body heat. \"Tor, the reasonnI brought you here, was I know you like it here...\" \"I love it here.\"nTorrance turned, and gave Cliff a reassuring smile, before turningnher head and resting it on his chest. \"Well, I love younwith all the love in my heart, you're my everything you know...?\"nCliff struggled to find the words, and became even more nervous. \"...Inwant to be with you forever, for you to have my children, for us tongrow old together. Just seeing you or hearing your voice makes mensmile, and your touch makes me feel complete. I don't know, I guessnI feel like we were just made for each other.\" Cliff leant down,nand saw Torrance crying, silently smiling through her tears. \"And,n...will you marry me? Torrance noddednthrough her tears, as she was too touched to form words, and wasnimmediately swept up into a long kiss with Cliff hugging her as if henwould never let go. \"Oh Cliff, I lovenyou so much.\" And the couple stayed wrapped up on the beach untilndawn.","Summary":" Torrance sat in Advanced Chem.

Rrrrrriiinnngggg………rrrrrrriiiiinnnnggg. The bell rang. Brittany felt as if she could jump out of her seat and do a back-handspring, which of course, for Brittany, was possible. She was nervous, because what she was about to tell Brad was the scariest thing ever. She wondered how he would react. She knew. He would hate her forever. Well at least the truth was coming out. She didn't know how to tell Jesse either. After all, it concerned him too, being her \"unofficial boyfriend\" meaning everyone knew they had a thing for each other, but Brittany and Brad were still dating. \"Brittany, you coming to practice tomorrow, right?\" asked Camille. She was always concerned with Brittany because she didn't know her that well. \"Yea, I'll be there.\" Brittany smiled, getting into her car. Camille smiled back. \"So fake\" They mumbled under their breath in unison. Brittany and Camille had been friends, but after the stunt she pulled at Nationals, doing spirit fingers during the routine. They went their separate ways. \"Brittany\" Jesse yelled This was not the person she wanted to see. She pretended like she didn't hear him, after all that's what she's been doing all semester. Jesse stood there confused and picking up his cell dialed her number. She saw caller I.d. and hit ignore. She couldn't be bothered with Crenshaw Heights people right now.

She was driving down Pacific Vista Way and she reached the school. She saw Brad walking to his car. \"Brad!\" Brittany yelled out of her convertible buggy. She turned down the music and waited for him to come to her car. \"Can we go somewhere, I have to tell you something. It's kind of important.\" \"Yea, sure babe. What about?\" Brad asked with his ego in the way of his brain. Making sure everyone saw how \"awesome\" he was, or at least thought he was. \"Nothing really. Just something that's been on my mind.\" She didn't want to tell him, but she knew that she owed it to him to tell him. \"Okay, when?\" \"Right now. If you don't have practice.\" \"I don't.\" \"Let's go.\" They reached a nearby lake where they both used to hang out. About 15 minutes later, the words finally reached Brittany's tongue and she finally spoke. \"Brad, I-I'm pregnant.\" the words came out easier than she thought. \"What in the world? How? We didn't do it yet you said you wanted it to be special.\" \"I know, the baby isn't yours-\" Brittany was cut off. \"You got raped!\" \"No, no the baby is Jesse's.\" Brad just walked back to his car, got in, and drove away. Brittany was left crying. Now the hard part. Telling Jesse. Luckily for her, he was calling. \"Jesse, please don't be mad at me. Just meet me at my house. Please Jesse I know you hate me for ignoring you, but if you do care about me you'll meet me there.\" \"Okay. I'll be there. Just Brit, tell me what's wrong.

Don't make me separate you two,\" Torrance broke the kiss laughing while Cliff just glared at his sister wishing that she'd spontaneously combust. \"Hey guys,\" the three turned their heads to see Courtney leaning over the top of her seat a big grin on her face, when we get back some of us are gonna hit the clubs, you up for it?\" her eyes were wide in anticipation and her hair bounced playfully due to the movement of the bus. \"I think I'm just gonna crash out,\" Torrance replied with a yawn, \"I'm gonna go to bed and get some rest.\" \"Hey Torrance, you can stay over our house tonight if you want,\" Missy said an innocent tone in her voice, \"Our parents have to fly to New York on business so me, you and Cliff will have the house all to ourselves,\" she didn't disguise her wink at Cliff who in turn gave her the finger. \"That's nice of you to offer but…\" Torrance was unsure if Cliff actually wanted her there. \"Come on, Cliff won't mind,\" Missy turned to her brother, \"will you?\" \"Of course not, I can crash on the couch and you can have my room,\" Torrance 'awed' at how sweet he was until a voice filtered up from the seat in front of them. \"Pussy.\" \"Shut up Les,\" Courtney yelled, \"I think its really sweet, but don't get too comfortable because if we're not going out tonight then that means the whole squad has to come out tomorrow at The Underground,\" she could see her two cheerleading counterparts looking pretty unsure, \"Come on, it'll be fun.\" Taking a glance over at Torrance who shrugged Missy turned back to Courtney, \"Alright, we'll be there. Say about nine?\" \"Great, I'll spread the word,\" leaping off of her seat Courtney began spreading the information to everybody that they'd better be at the Underground the next night by nine or they'd have her to answer too. \"That girl has some serious issues,\" Les laughed as Courtney practically threatened Jan until he agreed before moving on to the next row. --------------------------------------- The bus slowly rolled to a stop outside the Pantone household as the three weary travelers climbed off and collected their bags from the storage compartment, \"Are you sure it's okay?\" Torrance piped up as Cliff lugged both his bag as well as hers up the pathway towards the front door, \"I don't want to intrude.\" Missy laughed, \"Torrance would you shut up, I've told you a million times already that it's fine, here,\" she tossed the a key over to her, \"open the front door while Iron Man here struggles with the cases, I'm gonna go get the mail.\" \"Funny,\" Cliff snapped, he was positive he'd pulled his groin muscle. Torrance shook her head and smiled, it was very enjoyable to watch brother and sister duke it out over words, kinda like the way her little brother acted towards her. Sliding the key into the lock she gave a satisfied grunt and pushed the door open, stepping inside she immediately felt that something was wrong when she noticed that the light on the upstairs landing was on, also the alarm system on the wall to her left had been disabled. Her mind screamed at her to call for Cliff or Missy but she was instinctively drawn into the main room where an empty soda can was perched on the table. Clang Her head snapped to the side, she was positive she'd heard a noise, it had come from the kitchen, swallowing nervously Torrance slipped a hand inside of her jacket pocket and extracted her mace (a girl never could be too careful in this day and age). There was another sound, like a sort of low humming, whoever was in the house was definitely a male, \"Hey Torrance!\" Cliffs voice cut through the silence like a loudspeaker, \"can you please help me take your bag. I think I'm seriously injured.\" Uh oh. The humming had stopped, and now instead of the soft tune that had just filled her ears Torrance could now hear slow, methodical footsteps coming towards the divide between the door and the room that she was currently standing in. She wanted to run, but her legs seemed frozen, he was close now and the cheerleading captain watched as a shadow formed on the floor before a towering form seemed to block out all of the light from the kitchen shrouding the room and Torrance in darkness. Staring up at the guy he seemed confused, his brow was furrowed and his eyes studied her carefully, \"Hello.\" \"Ah!\" it was a reflex more than an intention, bringing her mace spray up she pushed the button down as hard as she could and jammed her eyes shut. She heard the man cry out in obvious agony as the spray burned his eyes and she watched him stumble back into the kitchen his hands holding his face, \"Torrance,\" obviously alerted by his girlfriends scream Cliff rushed into the room only to see his girlfriend standing over some guy who was hunched against the cabinets holding onto his face, \"Who the hell are you?\" \"The fucking pope, who the hell do you think?\" the guy cried, it sounded like he couldn't believe that Cliff didn't recognize him, \"What the hell's going on Cliff?\" Torrance turned to her boyfriend who was currently staring wide eyed at the figure who was beginning to get to his feet, \"Andrew?\" he asked a little unsure, \"is that you?\" \"Of course it's me,\" he yelled, \"who were you expecting.\" \"Obviously not you,\" Cliff laughed at an attempt to make a joke, however Andrew wasn't laughing and removed his hands to squint angrily at Cliff, \"how are you doing?\" \"How am I doing?\" the guy laughed, \"Not good Cliff, I just got maced, how do you think I'm doing?\" \"Cliff,\" Torrance whispered to her boyfriend who was currently helping this so called Andrew to the sink where he was rinsing out his eyes, \"who's Andrew?\" \"Oh right, hold on,\" after a few seconds Andrew reemerged and began drying his eyes with a dishtowel, \"Torrance this is Andrew…Missy's boyfriend and Andrew this is my girlfriend Torrance.\" \"Nice to meet you,\" he said through gritted teeth while extending his hand, Torrance stared dumbfounded up into his red, bloodshot eyes and couldn't think of a word to say, \"Well Cliff you still know how to pick em,\" retracting his hand Andrew shook his head, \"Where's your sister,\" it was then he noticed Missy standing in the doorway, there was no emotion on her face and she stared blankly back at the man her age that stood in front of her. Torrance quietly waited to see what would happen. -------------------------- To Be Continued By Raven[Chapter 2] Feelings Resurface ---------------------- \"Hey,\" Missy's voice was quiet and Torrance noticed that she seemed nervous, \"how'd you get in here?\" Andrew shrugged, \"Your backdoor wasn't locked in any serious way,\" he saw the reaction on everyone's faces, \"I'm kidding, you still keep the spare key under the plant pot. And you haven't changed your alarm code either.\" Missy nodded, there was more uncomfortable silence, \"Torrance, why don't you and Cliff go upstairs and get ready for bed,\" Torrance's mouth opened to protest, \"you know what I mean.\" \"Yeah, come on Tor, we can grab your bags later,\" holding his hand out Cliff watched as his girlfriend reluctantly entwined hers with it and let herself be led upstairs. Once Missy heard the door upstairs close she turned to Andrew who was still standing in the kitchen, \"What're you doing here?\" Missy cursed inside of her head, that came out a little more abrupt than she'd had planned. \"I came to see my girlfriend, or that's what you used to be, did I miss a memo telling me that we were over?\" even though Missy knew Andrew was joking he was also dead serious, \"I mean the last time I talked to you over the phone was three weeks ago.\" \"I'm sorry I haven't called, I've just been really busy with…stuff over here,\" Andrew nodded and thin smile on his face, \"What?\" \"Are you talking about the cheerleading?\" he saw the shocked expression on her face and smiled, \"ESPN 2 remember, it happened to be on while I was over at a friends house. Suddenly one of them piped up 'Hey Andrew, ain't that your girl cheerleading?'\" Missy stood there stunned, she'd never intended for Andrew to know about her cheerleading. Back in LA she used to swear to god that she'd rather die than become a cheerleader, but now things had changed. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but I…\" \"It's okay,\" Missy stalled her mouth agape, did he just say what she thought he said, he could see that she was confused, \"I said it's okay. Things change, just because you're a cheerleader doesn't mean that you're not the same person,\" he smiled warmly. \"Besides, in all honesty, it's kind of a turn on.\" Missy couldn't help but laugh, that was one of the things that had attracted her to Andrew, the way he could always seem to make a situation lighter no matter how dire it was. There was a few moments more silence before Missy spoke again, \"So, how come you didn't call before you decided to come visit. You know what my parents think about you.\" He shrugged, \"What I had to tell you couldn't be said over the phone,\" his eyes turned serious. Missy, knowing that whatever he was about to say was big took a seat on the couch, \"Michaels dead.\" Missy froze, \"What? When? How?\" \"He got shot, two weeks ago.\" \"And you're only telling me now!\" Missy leapt to her feet in a rage, \"why the hell didn't you tell me sooner?\" \"How the hell could I?\" Andrew yelled back, \"Every time I tried calling you Cliff said you were out, and no offense but it's not the kind of news you leave with Cliff.\" He quietened down as Missy turned her focus to the floor, her raven black hair shrouding her face from his sight. \"Who?\" she mentioned quietly, she was desperately trying to keep her emotions in check. \"Does it matter?\" \"I guess not,\" Missy buried her hands in her hair, she could feel the tears welling up in her eyes as her throat felt clogged like it always did when she got upset. \"When's the funeral?\" looking up at her boyfriend she saw the look he was giving her and new what it meant, it'd already been. She couldn't believe him sometimes, \"When?\" \"A couple of days ago, when you were in Florida,\" he paused, \"Ironically that was when I saw you on the television cheering,\" he chuckled somberly, \"Even though you weren't there you still kinda were.\" Missy didn't reply and just stood still, staring into space, \"So…\" he really wanted to change the subject, he hated seeing Missy upset, especially when it was because of him, \"…uh…whose the blonde with Cliff,\" Missy glanced up at him, \"I saw the two of you hugging so figured you must know each other.\" Missy gave a small, teasing smile, \"Another turn on for you was it?\" This time when he laughed though he did smile, scratching the back of his head he shrugged, \"Why? How much *has* changed?\" \"Well…I'm a cheerleader now, my new best friend is Torrance, who you just saw. I guess you could say I also have friends called Whitney and Courtney,\" she suddenly realized she didn't know how the hell that happened, \"and once again I'm flunking Math.\" \"Ah,\" he waved a hand dismissing the last comment, \"Who needs it.\" \"How bout you?\" Missy asked, her trademark gleam back in her eyes, \"Anything new I should know about?\" \"Apart from the obvious, no, I still look fantastic,\" he boasted swiping a hand across the side of his short, black hair. Missy looked him up and down, \"You look alright I guess, a little scruffy maybe. But alright.\" \"Gee, thanks. Now I remember why I go out with you,\" he smiled and took a small step closer, still a little unsure of how she'd react to him after hearing the news. \"And me? Anything changed there?\" Looking up into his deep brown eyes she saw what she always had done inside of him, what other people couldn't see through his brash, cocky attitude. She smiled, \"Nothing at all,\" leaning up slightly she brushed her lips lightly against his and felt the same tingle she always felt when she was with him. She didn't know whether it was love, or lust. And frankly…she didn't care. --------------------------------------- To Be Continued By Raven[Chapter 3] Warning Shades of R in this chapter, if you don't like, are too young or are offended by this chapter then I apologize Raven Uncomfortable Situation Torrance sat at the breakfast table alone, slowly she spooned her Cornflakes into her mouth while thinking about last night. When Missy had come up and got into bed she'd pretended that she was asleep, and then this morning when Torrance awoke Missy was already up. So she'd tried to find her, she needed to ask her best friend why it was that she'd never mentioned Andrew to her before. It wasn't like she'd never had the chance, last night she confronted Cliff about it but he just shrugged and said he didn't know. Then when Torrance asked him why he'd never mentioned Andrew he dismissed the comment by saying, \"It never came up.\" Sighing Torrance flicked her blonde hair that was currently set in pigtails over her shoulder, she couldn't get the image of what she'd seen this morning out of her head. She shuddered again, she was just glad that no one knew. Leaning back in her chair Torrance dropped her spoon into the now empty bowl and began to rerun the memories over in her head. After an unsuccessful search for Missy Torrance had ventured downstairs to discover a bunch of quilts set up on the couch. However the spot was empty, so not wanting to run into this Andrew again, since the last time went *so* well she had made her way back upstairs and to the bathroom. But when she opened the door she got the fright of her life, Missy was sat up on the sink with her legs wrapped around Andrews body, and let's just say that they weren't playing strip scrabble, or if they were they'd both lost. Torrance just stood there stunned and for a few moments couldn't move, with her mouth agape and her heart pounding she watched as the two had very feverish sex. Luckily Missy was too busy making out with her boyfriend to notice her and eventually her legs returned to working order and she closed the bathroom door. And so here she was. She'd read a note from Cliff reading that he'd gone on a grocery run and that he wouldn't be long, that was a half an hour ago. She heard the water upstairs get shut off, they'd obviously worked up a sweat and so had decided to take a shower. Torrance heard the distinct sound of Missy's laughter, she looked up hearing the sound of someone coming down the stairs and turned her head to see a now shirtless Andrew enter the kitchen. He glanced at her but she quickly avoided his gaze, he took a moment to look confused but bypassed her to the fridge and extracted the juice. Pouring himself a glass Torrance buried her head in her cereal as he pulled up a chair and took a seat opposite her. She kept her head down before eventually she had to look at him when he asked, \"You okay?\" Looking him in the eye she forced a smile onto her face, \"I'm fine.\" He didn't seem to believe her but seemed to let it go, \"Listen, we kinda got off on the wrong foot last night, what with you making me and all.\" \"I am so sorry about that,\" Torrance's guilt trip kicked in and she was just about to go off on another rambling session when he held up a hand stopping her. \"No harm, no foul. I understand how scared you must have been. And I apologize,\" he chuckled, \"So…can we start again,\" Torrance nodded, \"I'm Andrew,\" he extended his hand. \"Torrance,\" although the Rancho Carne Toro cheerleader couldn't stop thinking where that hand must've been she shook it anyway. \"Nice to meet you,\" she gave an affirming nod, \"So…you're from LA.\" \"Yep.\" \"What's it like there?\" \"Dangerous.\" \"That where you met Missy?\" he chuckled, \"What?\" He shook his head, \"Nothing. Yeah, that's where I met Missy.\" \"How did you meet?\" His eyebrows furrowed in confusion, \"Don't you know all this?\" now it was Torrance's turn to look confused, \"Missy told me last night that you said you couldn't wait to meet me,\" he paused for a second, \"Did she not tell you about me?\" \"Oh no, no…I mean yes, she did tell me about you. I just wanted to confirm that what she was telling me was true,\" he gave her a friendly smile and she breathed a sigh of relief, why didn't Missy tell her about him? \"Morning,\" speak of the devil, entering the kitchen Missy kissed her boyfriend, 'As if she hadn't kissed him enough already' Torrance's mind whispered before grabbing herself a bowl and taking a seat between Torrance and Andrew. \"So, what're you two talking about?\" \"Torrance was just asking me how we met,\" Andrew replied while removing a pack of Marlboro was his trouser pocket. Missy slapped his hand and pointed an accusing finger at him, \"Not in the house, my parents smell that then they're gonna know you were here. You need to smoke. Out the back.\" \"Yes mom,\" he remarked sarcastically, standing he exited through the backdoor and disappeared from view. \"Missy!\" Torrance hissed. Her best friend turned to face her and smiled, \"Yeah?\" but before Torrance could answer she quickly added, \"You didn't say anything to Andrew did you?\" \"No, of course not,\" Missy smiled and glanced back at the backdoor obviously believing that they're conversation was over, \"Missy!\" once again her best friend glanced at her, \"Why didn't you tell me that you had a boyfriend?\" Missy avoided Torrance's question and instead glanced at the backdoor again, \"It's complicated,\" Torrance couldn't see Missy's face and so didn't know whether she was just lying to get her to stop asking questions or if she was avoiding looking at her for some other reason. \"Missy, look at me,\" she did and Torrance made sure she was looking her dead in the eye when she said what she was about to say, \"We're best friends aren't we?\" The same cocky smile that Missy always had returned to her face, \"Of course.\" \"Then you do know that whatever is up between the two of you, you don't have to worry about telling me. Because as long as you stay as you, then I don't care,\" Missy looked at Torrance with grateful eyes before her guard seemed to come back up again. \"Aw, you're so sweet,\" Torrance shook her head with a smile, \"I'll tell you everything Torrance, it's just that I really want the two of you to get along and I'm afraid that if I tell you everything then you're gonna be scared of him. Plus I got some bad news last night, and if I start talking about it then I may start crying, which is so not me,\" she shoveled a spoonful of cereal into her mouth. Torrance smiled reassuringly, \"Okay, I'll wait. But…you have to tell me *everything* about the two of you,\" Missy smiled and nodded, the cereal she was chewing currently preventing any form of speech from taking place. \"He seems nice enough, but there's something…mysterious about him, it's kinda…\" \"Dangerous?\" Missy finished after successfully swallowing her cereal. \"Yeah.\" Missy smiled, \"I know, it's such a turn on.\" \"Missy!\" Torrance exclaimed. Missy just laughed, \"Oh come Torrance, are you seriously telling me you've never been attracted to that kind of guy before?\" Torrance shook her head, \"I'm fine with Cliff, thank you very much.\" Missy opened her mouth to say something when Andrew reemerged through the backdoor rubbing his arms aginst one another, \"God, it's freezing outside. My pecks are so cold they cut glass right now,\" Missy laughed and even Torrance couldn't help but smile, \"I'm gonna go get a shirt on okay,\" leaving the kitchen he almost ran into Cliff who was bundling two full bags of groceries through the front door, \"Hey Cliff, you okay?\" \"Fine,\" Cliff muttered, bypassing Andrew he slung the bags up onto the table and let out a sigh. \"Sorry I took so long, I ran into Jan at the store,\" he kissed Torrance a good morning before a voice cut in. \"Love is in the air, everywhere I look around…\" \"Shut up Andrew,\" Missy called, \"I think it's very sweet my brother is so in lurve,\" she smiled deviously. \"Anyway…\" Cliff continued while staring daggers at his sister, \"Jan asked if we were still going to the Underground tonight,\" making his way around he wrapped his arms around Torrance and squatted down so his head was resting comfortably on her shoulder. Torrance looked at Missy who shrugged, \"Sure, Torrance spoke up. I think it'll be a good time, plus it'll give Andrew a chance to meet everybody,\" Missy gave a grateful smile to her best friend. \"What'd you say Andrew?\" Cliff called, \"You up for it?\" Reentering the kitchen Andrew shrugged, \"Sure, sounds like fun.\" \"Great,\" Cliff got to his feet, \"Then tonight, we party.\" To Be Continued By Raven","LastChapter":"Warning Shades of R in this chapter, if you don't like, are too young or are offended by this chapter then I apologize Raven Uncomfortable Situation Torrance sat at the breakfast table alone, slowly she spooned her Cornflakes into her mouth while thinking about last night.

I do adore the movie; in any case, it's a one-shot with absolutely no point. I feel a little silly writing an English fanfic based on a Spanish movie, but here I am, not caring enough to not write it. ;) Just fluff. Takes place sometime after Pan and Ofelia met (obviously) and before her mother has complications with the baby. Short and sweet. Most Humble Servant Ofelia lay next to her mother on her bed. Carmen's shirt was pulled up and bunched below her full breasts, aching from the baby. The skin of her belly was stretched taut and trembling with the child's movements. A tiny foot bubbled the skin below the bellybutton, and Ofelia traced its movements with her fingertips. \"Does it hurt?\" she asked softly. Carmen smiled and shrugged. \"Sometimes it's uncomfortable. You don't worry your pretty head, darling,\" she said, stroking Ofelia's hair. Ofelia smiled and pressed her palm against the warm belly. The baby again kicked up against her hand. Her eyes lit up and she looked at Carmen. \"Mama! He kicked me!\" Carmen laughed. \"He's quite a busy baby,\" she mused. They lay like that for some time, until Carmen started drifting off. She smoothed her hands over her belly and sighed. \"Time for bed, Ofelia. Go to your room,\" she murmured, kissing her daughter's forehead. Ofelia complied and closed the door quietly behind her, making her way through the dark. She glowed like a spectre, her skin oddly pale in the darkness of the hallway. Pan sensed her coming, and he waited in the shadows. Ofelia slipped out of her clothes, not noticing the faun's presence. He shied away from her nakedness, casting his gaze to the floor. She put on a nightgown and crawled sleepily underneath the blankets. She lay on her side, back to Pan, and let her eyes close. Before Ofelia fell asleep, she heard a distinct rustling sound and opened her eyes. She could make out the shapes of three fairies flitting through the air, their tough wings brushing against each other as they flew. They landed on her, tiny feet tickling her cheek and hair, her shoulder. She smiled and sat up gently, as not to hurt or frighten the fae, and turned to find Pan. He emerged from the shadows, grinning. His teeth glistened and his body cracked as he moved, the gnarls and whorls of wood ever-shifting. Ofelia clapped her hands together and scooted over to make room. \"Faun!\" A broad grin spread over his face as he took a seat next to her. The fae swirled around them, giggling like the tinkling of bells. Her eyes were lit up and her smile infectious. Pan reached over to stroke her hair, his rough thumb grazing her cheek. She leaned into the gesture and rested against him. \"How is my Princess?\" he asked. She closed her eyes as she felt his ancient voice rumble up through his chest. \"Tired... but happy that you're here. I felt the baby today.\" Pan looked down on the top of her head and continued to touch her hair. He took care not to scratch her or handle her too roughly. \"How is the baby?\" he askd. Ofelia's smile stretched further. \"He's a busy baby,\" she replied, echoing her mother's earlier response. Pan could feel the warmth radiating through her body. He listened to her pulse, the way it subtlely vibrated her skin and the air around it. He wished she could sense how it turned the air into music and heated his soul through and through. \"I want to have children someday,\" Ofelia murmured wistfully. Pan ran his fingertips down her arm. Her skin tightened and turned to gooseflesh, her body tightening up for a moment before relaxing. He felt a strange mixture of emotions inside of him. Ofelia was still a child; but her statement made him wonder. Could he someday give her what she wished for? He could read her skin and eyes and body like a book, he could see in his mind's eye the beautiful woman she would blossom into. He knew she was wise beyond her years, for her soul was so old. He knew Ofelia, even if she couldn't remember. At least, he knew Moanna . \"Princess,\" he whispered, too low for human ears to listen. But still he felt Ofelia tense up again. \"Faun?\" she asked, looking up at him. \"Did you hear something?\" He looked down at her, her beautiful young face. His heart seemed to burst into flames inside of him; it was certain to him that he loved her beyond words. He would do absolutely anything for her. \"Not a thing, lovely girl. Try to sleep.\"","LastChapter":"Author's Note: I don't know exactly what forced me to write this; I don't particularly care for Pan's Labyrinth fanfiction. I do adore the movie; in any case, it's a one-shot with absolutely no point. I feel a little silly writing an English fanfic based on a Spanish movie, but here I am, not caring enough to not write it. ;) Just fluff. Takes place sometime after Pan and Ofelia met (obviously) and before her mother has complications with the baby. Short and sweet. Most Humble Servant Ofelia lay next to her mother on her bed. Carmen's shirt was pulled up and bunched below her full breasts, aching from the baby. The skin of her belly was stretched taut and trembling with the child's movements. A tiny foot bubbled the skin below the bellybutton, and Ofelia traced its movements with her fingertips. \"Does it hurt?\" she asked softly. Carmen smiled and shrugged. \"Sometimes it's uncomfortable. You don't worry your pretty head, darling,\" she said, stroking Ofelia's hair. Ofelia smiled and pressed her palm against the warm belly. The baby again kicked up against her hand. Her eyes lit up and she looked at Carmen. \"Mama! He kicked me!\" Carmen laughed. \"He's quite a busy baby,\" she mused. They lay like that for some time, until Carmen started drifting off. She smoothed her hands over her belly and sighed. \"Time for bed, Ofelia. Go to your room,\" she murmured, kissing her daughter's forehead. Ofelia complied and closed the door quietly behind her, making her way through the dark. She glowed like a spectre, her skin oddly pale in the darkness of the hallway. Pan sensed her coming, and he waited in the shadows. Ofelia slipped out of her clothes, not noticing the faun's presence. He shied away from her nakedness, casting his gaze to the floor. She put on a nightgown and crawled sleepily underneath the blankets. She lay on her side, back to Pan, and let her eyes close. Before Ofelia fell asleep, she heard a distinct rustling sound and opened her eyes. She could make out the shapes of three fairies flitting through the air, their tough wings brushing against each other as they flew. They landed on her, tiny feet tickling her cheek and hair, her shoulder. She smiled and sat up gently, as not to hurt or frighten the fae, and turned to find Pan. He emerged from the shadows, grinning. His teeth glistened and his body cracked as he moved, the gnarls and whorls of wood ever-shifting. Ofelia clapped her hands together and scooted over to make room. \"Faun!\" A broad grin spread over his face as he took a seat next to her. The fae swirled around them, giggling like the tinkling of bells. Her eyes were lit up and her smile infectious. Pan reached over to stroke her hair, his rough thumb grazing her cheek. She leaned into the gesture and rested against him. \"How is my Princess?\" he asked. She closed her eyes as she felt his ancient voice rumble up through his chest. \"Tired... but happy that you're here. I felt the baby today.\" Pan looked down on the top of her head and continued to touch her hair. He took care not to scratch her or handle her too roughly. \"How is the baby?\" he askd. Ofelia's smile stretched further. \"He's a busy baby,\" she replied, echoing her mother's earlier response. Pan could feel the warmth radiating through her body. He listened to her pulse, the way it subtlely vibrated her skin and the air around it. He wished she could sense how it turned the air into music and heated his soul through and through. \"I want to have children someday,\" Ofelia murmured wistfully. Pan ran his fingertips down her arm. Her skin tightened and turned to gooseflesh, her body tightening up for a moment before relaxing. He felt a strange mixture of emotions inside of him. Ofelia was still a child; but her statement made him wonder. Could he someday give her what she wished for?

The Guardian's Princess Princess Moanna settled next to her guardian, her head resting on his leg. After her reincarnated body, named Ofelia, was killed by that hijo-de-puta captain and she returned to her kingdom, she spent many hours celebrating her coming home with her family and their subjects, the faun always watching. Her exhaustion plainly showed through her joy and the celebration was ended; she needed rest before she could once again sit properly on her throne at her father's side. Rather than make the long trek to her own chambers, she had found her way to the faun's side and asked if he would keep her company; she knew that her mother and father would not worry if she was in his care. With a smile and a bow, he had agreed. He sat at the center of the labyrinth, the maze that had and would continue to serve as his domain and her playground, his back against the stone carving of himself and the royal children, and his princess's head in his lap. He stroked her hair with his impossibly long fingers and hummed a haunting lullaby until her eyes closed and he heard her breaths become deeper and slower. The faun let out a content sigh, glad to have his princess back home and by his side. So absorbed in his delight was he that he did not notice the fairy approaching him. It flitted up to his eye level, glancing from him to the girl in his lap and back to him, a knowing glint in its eyes and the air of 'I know a secret about you' filling its features. The faun angrily swatted at the pest. \"Away!\" he growled. One well-timed pass of his hand sent the fairy spiraling out of sight. Silence settled back in the labyrinth, only broken by the princess's soft breaths and an occasional sound from the faun that could only be described as a purr. He looked up to the moon, a mere sliver of its full glory, as it sailed through the starry sea. His lips curved up in a genuine smile as his gaze fell to the young girl's brightly-clad shoulder, thinking of the crescent-shaped mark that adorned her skin beneath the fabric of her gown. He doubted that she knew its true meaning: that she was his and no other's. The princess was still too young to be courted, but he would personally see to it that any male who challenged his claim would not leave the palace with his head intact. He knew that even though the king and queen had promised their beloved daughter to him when she was of age, they would still go through the formality of searching for a suitable mate for her. However, they would not prolong the farce, knowing of the faun's possessive nature; he would maim any boy that attempted to win her hand and appeared to succeed. He growled low in his throat at the notion that a human would try to take what was his. He lost her once to her own curiosity when she ventured Aboveground; he would not lose her to an inferior male, especially when she was promised to him at her birth! Such violent thoughts did not suit him at this moment; the faun banished them from his mind. Instead of lingering on such destructive fantasies, he focused his gaze back on the slumbering figure of his princess and the smile returned to his face. His nimble fingers crept down her side to splay out on her stomach. He longed for the day when he would see her belly swollen with life, carrying his child in her womb. True, she was still a child, but she was fast approaching womanhood as well. It would not be long before he was allowed to act on his right to her. A sigh rattled from his throat as he thought of what lay just outside his grasp, conveying so many emotions that no human could comprehend. He became suddenly aware of the sensitivity of his fingers as their tips slid sensually, yet with a veneer of innocence, over her golden gown and through her chocolate locks. The sensations he felt through simple touch were like heaven; he had never experienced textures such as those of the princess's dress and hair, and he relished the contact. The faun craved the sensation as a dying man craves life; the desire to have her forever in his arms and at his side pushed itself to the forefront of his thoughts, eliciting yet another sigh. \"My princess,\" he whispered tenderly to the sleeping girl. \"How long must you make me suffer? When can I finally have you?\" As if in reply, the princess shifted in her sleep, turning to lie on her back. Her eyes were still closed and her breaths remained deep and even. The faun smiled again at her unconscious display of blind trust in him. He absolutely loved her vulnerability; it gave him reason to be around her for hours at a time, gave him something to protect. All thoughts of her future courting fled before the image of her lying on her back at his side, her hand coming up to light upon his leg, her tiny fingers holding a power over him that he found both strange and comforting. Her head moved a little before she took a deep breath and opened her eyes sleepily. The smile on the faun's lips grew as he locked her eyes with his, capturing her attention. \"Did something disturb your sleep, princess?\" She shook her head, still not completely out of her dreamland. \"No,\" she said, her voice tinged with sleep. \"I just thought that I heard something; a voice, longing for something, and kind of sad.\" Before a look of surprise could register on the faun's features, she shrugged and moved to sit up. The faun tried to ease her back to the ground. \"There was nothing, princess,\" he assured her. \"T'was merely a dream. You need to rest.\" The princess silently refused his aid. She pulled herself up to a sitting position and leaned closer to him, already drifting back to her dreams. \"Will you always stay with me?\" she asked with a small yawn. The faun wrapped an arm around her, pulling her closer to his side. \"From now unto the ending of time, my princess.\" And into death itself as well, he thought, his fingers resuming their duty of stroking her hair as sleep once again descended on the girl. Only the moon was witness to what had transpired, and it would guard its secret for eternity. -Fin-","LastChapter":"Note: This is the first of two versions of this story.

Sorry that it took so long. Bang! The tough mahogany table slammed against the wall, a long crack growing in length as it pulled away. Moanna, lying on the table with her billowy skirts pulled up high on her waist and her shirt opened up to show off her bare perky breasts, breathed out through a flushed face of blushing red, \"Shhh... shhhh... Quiet, my dear. Or everyone will hear us again.\" She turned her head and whimpered once more as she recalled the embarrassement of the morning after her honeymoon when all servents and subjects refused to look at her and questioned nervously if she had a good enough sleep that prior night. His smooth heavily accented voice that often had a jittery bounce to it heaved harshly in a loud whisper as he moved deeper within her, \"I apologize, my princess, my love. I cannot help myself; I love you so much!\" He thrusted himself completely in at the last syllable. She screeched back a scream and tossed her head back as she arched up. Her long wavy brown locks rose up with her, cascading and scratching her sensitive in the moment skin. But his long fingers gently pushed her back, wanting to continue with this and not have her orgasm completely and finish most likely. His hand returned to the edge of the table, hodling it with intent. One of her hands that had been clawing through the table in orgasmic bliss released it's tension and rested heavily against her sweaty forehead. Her eyes shifted throughout the golden room as her breath quickened and her husband continued his ardent thrusting into her. Her toe nails scratched his back as her feet moved up and down. Her legs jerked all about. Another orgasm rolled over her and her gaze melted down to her husband. Pan. Pan, Pan, Pan, Pan, Pan, Pan... The name just rang in her mind. He was older than her, his soul was older than hers, she knew it. He was around as long as her father was, as soon as the world started spinning and life was first breathed into the forest, he existed. She came along a few millenia after. Even if he was older, even if he was a creature rather than... human in what most would say.. she was utterly in love with him. She was in love with him ever since she first met him that night, the night when the fairy had flew into her room and led her outside beneathe the dark night and the shining cresent moon. But... love was not the first thing that had come to her mind then, love grew and blossomed and made itself known to her when she was 16. Now she was 19. But then, when she was only 12... there was amazement, there was disbelief, more importantly, there was familiarity. It was as though she knew him from before, like she had dreamed of him once and it was like their meeting was fate, had already been predicted. That was why she didn't run that night; wasn't even scared though he begged her not to be. She breathed in deep as he unsheathed himself from her slowly, only to charge at her with such ferocity that it made her core burn for him even more. She was a princess; princesses had the finer things in life and did everything by traditions and rules. She had no need for such things; she lived for impulse and adventure. He was what she lived for. She breathed in deep once more, their heavy breathing mixing in together. His smell. She loved his smell. One thing she noticed was that nearly everyone had no smell at all.. they were too clean with nothing that could mark them. She was reminded of dolls; dolls that could move and walk and talk. But he.. he had that earthy smell that tempted her to just roll around and bury herself in that scent like a wild dog. It smelled of Man and Work. It reminded her of the good things in life, the working half that had often been overshadowed by war and many other horrible things. He was as how all Fauns looked, perhaps.. he was even uglier than some of them. But she paid no attention to that; if all the world's romance were revolved solely on looks, could love really exist then? She didn't mind his ugliness at all, he in fact look wiser and more ancient in a mythical way with the moss and flora growing all over his tree-like body. Still, after he married her when she came to age at 18, he groomed himself and washed himself more often, even going far as to wear some sort of clothing on his strong body. Yes.. no matter what, for what he was, she loved him unconditionally. Moanna whimpered suddenly as his tall form just loomed over her, they looked deep into each other's eyes. Her amber-brown ones gazing into his sky blue ones, he smiled deviously. She blushed and turned her head away from his stare. Why did he have to stop? Why couldn't he have just continued? They were both enjoying themselves, they could rest in each other's arms, talk with each other after. But to stop and tease her during their love-making was embarassing for her. She was in her most vunreable position and he was drinking in it while acting so casual about it. \"Please.... don't look at me that way.\" she begged him. She could see from the corner of her eye; he tilted his head, his ears twitching, \"Why?\" He knew. He wanted her to admit to him, but she wouldn't give up so easily. \"Because..... I'm embarrassed....\" He laughed at her, his stare still burning into her view, \"You didn't look so embarrassed earlier.... you looked like you were enjoying yourself very.... much.\" Her eyes rolled back into her head, \"Pleeasee.... I love you..... I love you.....\" He sighed as he stroked a long finger down the cleavage between her breasts. He bent down lower and kissed the cleavage, sucking away some of the salty sweat as well, \"Of course, My Princess, I live..... only to serve you.\" He raised himself up and his fingers cracked like breaking wood as he rolled his fingers on the table edge and gripped it tight. \"Moanna!\" he cried as he thrusted hard into her. \"Ohhohh.\" she gasped out as he nailed himself into her. They made love on the table, they often chose to make love that way rather than any other style or on the bed. The bed was impractical in a way; it couldn't really support Pan's weight be it while they were having sexual relations or if he was sleeping. He rarely slept anyway. He always had to be on guard, watching his forest and her. Plus, having getting used to the table way, they could make love almost everywhere. He was taller than her. If they were to do it on the floor, her face would be buried in the high of his abdomen and chest and she wouldn't be able to kiss him during. Moanna was still too innocent to do it doggie-style or attempt bronco-riding. She was inexperienced as well, he knew more about sex than she did and the only way they could comply with the both of their needs would be table wise. He would, as always like habit, waltz her into a vacant room, mostly their bedroom since it had the strongest table. She would act coy as she did, not wanting to seem too horny and submit to him so quickly. But he would get to her quick; bending down to her level, kissing the edge of her neck while skillfully undoing the front of her dress. He would leave her clothes on her, but still take it apart to reveal all he wanted. THen in the midst of their kissing, he would carry her as he did on their wedding night and place her on the table delicatly, the cold wood freezed her hot skin. She would take a deep breath, watching closely as he would unbutton his coat and throw it on the ground without a care. Then, her skirt would be pushed up as she shimmied her body for it to be out of the way on her hips. He would pull her down on the table, her womanhood would meet his area. By pure instinct and reflex, her legs would hook around his waist and her hands would be at the table clawing. He would smile that smile of his and lean against the table to prepare. Then it would start. He charged at her, her toes curling as he did so. She would try not to look directly into his ears, fearing that her shyness would come back and she would cease this pleasure. Instead, she would see him. His beautiful lean torso that was glittered with sweat. She was so tempted sometimes to just raise herself up and lick his entire body, but no.. she couldn't. She wouldn't. She knew that he would probably love it if she did, but.. the thought of it.. the thought of it.. too much! How his chest would pulse like she could see his very heart beat against his ribcage. She wondered if his heart was going as fast as hers would. Then to his strong arms at both sides of her. Those arms were so strong. She could remember one night when she was younger, she was asleep. He carried her in his arms and it was so gentle that she thought she was simply being lulled to sleep by the sea itself. Her dainty fingertips rose up from the table, trembling as she graced the lines printed on his strongs arms. He growled, but not menacingly, more like a purr from a lion. She giggled. His rhythm was steady, making it last longer and feeding the flame within her. The table screeched as it moved across the floor. Bang! They smashed into the wall. She jumped up, still sheathed over him and clutched his strong shoulders. The table was truly a miraculous thing, she could meet him face to face, see eye to eye. As he continued pulping into her, his hands on the table, gripping to keep it from crashing into the wall again, her nails scratched him, leaving welts on his back. He chuckled a throaty laugh, \"Are you feeling bolder this time, My Princess?\" She breathed out her airless response, \"Can... Can.... we try.... this differently.... this time?\" One of his hands released the table and went to the small of her back, pushing her up and letting gravity send her down on his hard member. He growled, \"¿In what way, My Princess?\" Her head bent back as far as it could and she bit him on his collarbone. He groaned outloud. She wondered if he liked it or it hurt. She decided to try it again, nipping him a tad softer again and kissing the area. He groaned and she could feel his abs shaking against her stomach. It tickled her. She kissed his chest over and over, the words coming in between, \"I.... I.... Against the wall, please.....\" He complied quick. He swept her off the table and supported her weight as he swiftly went to the wall. His hand around her back, cushioned the assault. He pushed her higher on the wall so that they were face to face. She blushed looking at him and buried her head in the crook of his neck. She was still too shy for him to look her in the eye. Her legs were wrapped tighter around his waist, clawing into him, while his hands fondled herarse, the dress ruffling as he did so. \"Like this, My Princess?\" he grunted as he quickly kissed the top of her head and buried his face in her air, their bodies completely locked together. His movements were smaller, not as big as before, but he could still have her entire being explode into a fierce orgy. The burning inside, the warming glow spearding from her core all throughout to her fingertips and the rest... He was so good! More, closer and closer, she was feeling tipsy. She was going to come any time soon, the climax would boom all over. Her walls closed tighter and tighter around him as his movements were more graceful with agression, going as deep, as far as he could inside her. \"Ohhh..oohh....\" she groaned outloud in his ears as she came, her walls were shut around him and she could feel him shaking against her. He must have been close as well. He shoved into her one last time and he shook so violently that it was as though he was being possessed. But the shaking stopped with a long siiighhh. \"That.... was amazing.\" he murmured as he carefully set her down on the floor, sinking with her as they rested against each other. She kissed him on his smooth cheek and reminded, \"¿Remember the second time we met?\" He nodded his head, \"Yes, how can I forget?\" She giggled a bit and kissed him on his chin, \"You showed me a statue of when I was the Princess Moanna and the person standing behind was you.\" \"Yes, that statue was you when you were but 50 years of human essence. You were so young and carefree to me then, you still are.\" Time moved differently in the Underworld. The people down there counted years as humans would count days. 10 years in the Underworld could've passed and to the humans it would've been about a century. \"There was a baby in my arms and you would not answer when I asked you about it.\" His tone sounded a little bit nervous, \"That time we met, you were just a little girl. I didn't think that you needed to know about matters like that until it was certain you were indeed our Princess returned to us.\" She breathed out, \"That was our baby, wasn't it? You knew that it was bound to happen, right? Did everybody else know?\" \"Yes, everybody knew about the engagement. But you were still so innocent to the thought of marriage and adulthood. When I met you that second time as the youngling Ophelia, I was almost sure you were her and I wanted to tell you all. Could I have told a little girl of 12 that she was already promised to a faun who was as old as the Earth, the stars, her own father as well? No, I chose to stay as your guardian for you to grow up and understand this idea. But your curiosity took you away from me before you could've properly grow up. Still, it wasn't such a big surprise that statues of you were erected afterwards for the belief that your parents, their Highnesses, that you would someday return back, though it was more of a future meeting the past.\" he verfied. His hand suddenly went to her bare breast and he started fondling her, \"¿Why do you bring it up now? Are you ready for a child now? Do you want one?\" She kissed him on the lips, \"I'm pregnant.\" And that's it. I don't think I'm going to continue this fic. Hope you enjoyed it.

Until then, here's a humorous story about the Pale Man and Ofelia/Moanna. By the way, try to imagine Doug Jones' [he played the Pale Man] voice when the Pale Man is speaking. Enjoy! Also, just as a warning: possibly crappy story is possibly crappy. I wrote this in half an hour, so... Princess Moanna had finally returned to her parents, the rulers of the underworld. They were overjoyed to see their daughter again, and requested that she tell them about how she returned to them. The princess told her parents of how she had come back to them, from when she had first met the faun, to the tall, strange monster that had almost eaten her when she went to retrieve the ornate dagger, to her death at the hands of her step-father. The king frowned. \"A tall, strange monster that had tried to eat you, you say,\" he muttered. Moanna nodded. \"That's right,\" she said. \"Did he have eyes in his hands?\" She nodded again. The king paused to think. \"That monster you saw is called the Pale Man. He is one of my servants used in the tasks for the mortal girl suspected to be my reincarnated daughter.\" he explained to her. \"His task was to devour anyone who was not actually the reincarnation. The Pale Man could tell it was the wrong person by sensing if they did not match the aura of me and your mother.\" The princess cocked her head to the side, slightly confused. \"He didn't attack me for that,\" she said. \"He attacked me because I ate the food on the table.\" The king was just as confused. \"That's odd,\" he said. \"I need to ask the Pale Man. He needs to explain what happened.\" He ordered the faun go out and retrieve the Pale Man from where he had been placed thousands of years before. When the Pale Man and the faun returned, Moanna stepped back a few steps, frightened by seeing the monster that had almost eaten her. He made the same ungodly noise as he had when they had last met. It turned into a cough. \"Could someone give me a glass of water?\" the monster asked. \"My throat is really dry.\" \"Y-You can talk,\" Moanna muttered. \"Of course I can,\" replied the Pale Man. \"Why would you think I couldn't, princess?\" The princess made a few steps toward the monster. \"Well, when I saw you in that room with the food and dagger, you only made that creepy-\" The monster cut her off. \"Wait, when was that?\" the Pale Man asked. \"I don't remember seeing you, princess.\" \"You don't remember? I ate two grapes off your table, you woke up, killed two of the fairies I was with, and then tried to eat me.\" she reminded him. The Pale Man did not answer immediately. He slowly said, \"Oh, you were that little girl. Well, jeez, I almost ate the princess.\" He laughed. \"Boy would that have been stupid, huh?\" His laughs grew louder. Moanna stared at the monster. \"I have another question, Pale Man.\" the princess told him, pulling his attention back to her. \"Go ahead, princess.\" the monster said, still chuckling a bit. \"Why did you attack me when I ate that food on the table? Father told me that you only attacked people because their auras didn't match the king and queen's.\" The Pale Man stopped to think. \"Oh! I remember! See, after the king assigned me to one of the tasks to find his daughter after she'd been reincarnated, I didn't think it'd take that long. I was really excited to see you again so I made a nice feast for you and me when you would arrive. While I waited, I must've fallen asleep. I was having this weird nightmare, so I woke up. That happened to be the time you had eaten two of my grapes.\" \"But, the faun said not to eat any of the food. Why did he do that?\" Moanna asked. The Pale Man replied, \"Oh, that? I seem the recall that he had visited me after a while to see how I was doing, and he saw all that food. He asked if he could have some and I said 'Get your own dang food'. Maybe he thought it was for me only and thought if you tried to eat my food, you'd get in trouble. That wasn't the case, as I explained earlier. \"Now I'm going to continue on with what happened when I woke up from my weird nightmare. I heard some noises so I put in my eyes to see who it was. My eyesight was kind of fuzzy because I'd been alseep so long, so I couldn't make out who it was. Your fairies started distracting me, and that's when I realized I was really hungry, so I ate them as a quick snack. I was trying to catch up with you to see who you were but you kept running and my walking was a little screwy because I was so brittle from not eating and because I hadn't moved in a lot of years.\" he explained. \"What about that strange sound you were making?\" she asked. \"Oh, that. See, my throat was incredibly dry for not drinking for a long time, so that's the most intelligible sound I could make. I was trying to tell you to stop but it didn't come out right.\" the Pale Man replied. Moanna sighed. \"And I suppose you have a reason for having those drawings of you eating children on the ceiling?\" The monster nodded. \"While I was waiting, I was really bored so I drew some pictures.\" he said. \"I think I'm a pretty good artist.\" The king smiled. \"See, dear? There's an explanation for everything.\" Moanna did not answer. She did not agree with her father, nor did she say anything to the Pale Man. All she did was facepalm. A/N: THE END. This is so ridiculous. It makes sense, though, how the Pale Man is actually nice because I can't take him seriously at the result of the interview with Doug Jones [is he related to Alfred F. Jones? Hats off to you if you get the reference.] while he was in the Pale Man costume. Thanks for reading, everyone!","LastChapter":"A/N: I randomly thought of this when I was plotting my other Pan's Labyrinth fic, which should be up once I see the movie again. Until then, here's a humorous story about the Pale Man and Ofelia/Moanna. By the way, try to imagine Doug Jones' [he played the Pale Man] voice when the Pale Man is speaking. Enjoy! Also, just as a warning: possibly crappy story is possibly crappy. I wrote this in half an hour, so... Princess Moanna had finally returned to her parents, the rulers of the underworld. They were overjoyed to see their daughter again, and requested that she tell them about how she returned to them. The princess told her parents of how she had come back to them, from when she had first met the faun, to the tall, strange monster that had almost eaten her when she went to retrieve the ornate dagger, to her death at the hands of her step-father. The king frowned. \"A tall, strange monster that had tried to eat you, you say,\" he muttered. Moanna nodded. \"That's right,\" she said. \"Did he have eyes in his hands?\" She nodded again. The king paused to think. \"That monster you saw is called the Pale Man. He is one of my servants used in the tasks for the mortal girl suspected to be my reincarnated daughter.\" he explained to her. \"His task was to devour anyone who was not actually the reincarnation. The Pale Man could tell it was the wrong person by sensing if they did not match the aura of me and your mother.\" The princess cocked her head to the side, slightly confused. \"He didn't attack me for that,\" she said. \"He attacked me because I ate the food on the table.\" The king was just as confused. \"That's odd,\" he said. \"I need to ask the Pale Man. He needs to explain what happened.\" He ordered the faun go out and retrieve the Pale Man from where he had been placed thousands of years before. When the Pale Man and the faun returned, Moanna stepped back a few steps, frightened by seeing the monster that had almost eaten her. He made the same ungodly noise as he had when they had last met. It turned into a cough. \"Could someone give me a glass of water?\" the monster asked. \"My throat is really dry.\" \"Y-You can talk,\" Moanna muttered. \"Of course I can,\" replied the Pale Man. \"Why would you think I couldn't, princess?\" The princess made a few steps toward the monster. \"Well, when I saw you in that room with the food and dagger, you only made that creepy-\" The monster cut her off. \"Wait, when was that?\" the Pale Man asked. \"I don't remember seeing you, princess.\" \"You don't remember? I ate two grapes off your table, you woke up, killed two of the fairies I was with, and then tried to eat me.\" she reminded him. The Pale Man did not answer immediately.

And this is for Lucinda the Maid. A/N - Fauns are too beautiful and cruel to be subservient without good reason. Also: did you see the look he gave her? HO'boy. Minotaur In dreams of an ancient, ageless city whose spires and stairways nestle deep in the valley between dawn and the horizon, the faun is still incorrigibly immortal, and the night is not so cold. ( Keep together . This is not a dream, not a dream .) He lingers over his tiny, fey companions, murmuring and folding up their filigree wings in his hands. A sound of icy bells as they shiver. ( Mortality is so cold. You could die out here. ) There is a king somewhere on a golden throne, waiting at the end to say happily ever after, once upon a time and send them into the belly of destiny for the first time all over again. Deconstruct the great monuments. Undo the histories. Turn back the sky. Every step and breath and enchanted kiss will build the world anew, so delicate and iridescent by moonlit incantations. ( It's true; we saw it, we were there .) But all of that was so very long ago. The faun remembers: Dark hunts in the twilight, when magic ran wild over the smooth flanks of the world; quick, bright eyes winking like stars from hidden places, and the fluid silhouettes of his own kind striking out at all the light and beauty that had ever been; fearless, breathless, shining skies; strange birds; the power of true eclipse; and the curiosity of young girls who wandered too far from home, too close to feral lands. Times immemorial. Past, now; gone. He is older. He has seen the courtly halls and made his home within them, perhaps reluctantly in the beginning, but the old ways are not the only ways. The slow, steady march of time taught him that. While his violent kin were driven to the ghostly fringes of their former domain, he found himself welcome among the glittering folk, the ones who forged legends, the kingmakers themselves, and how brightly they shine. (How bright, how bold, how he wishes they only knew what he would do if the magic ran again, all fleet feet and burning breath as it chases down the wounded, soft as tongues until the catch.) In some ways, he resents them. Mischief is his blood; treachery is his flesh. Fauns are children of the mountain and the river and they have no true masters. (Mother, Father; look at what they've done .) They've gone and lost a darling child, a pretty little princess. When he agrees to scale the world's spine and search for her on the surface, it is his own decision, and he makes it because there is nothing better to do. She picks her way through the tall grass and stands before him. Sunlight makes her dark eyes glitter. She says; (hello.) This is their first meeting once upon a very long time ago, or else a dream woven from golden threads and fireflies. He says nothing, so she looks right into his face and adds apologetically; (I'm a princess.) He smiles, because what else can he do? (Of course you are.) And, of course, she is. The memory of darkness takes the sky, and black scavenger birds fill its hollows with the harsh music of their wings. All the countless pieces of their bladed bodies come together; and then they fall, calling thunder; fall apart. ( I feel the passage of monsters in these shadows .) Ascending from the deep, this is the first thing he sees, the smoky spiral of carnivores riding on what little light remains, and from beyond high stone walls he hears the trees groaning as they are released from their burdens. ( But we are not afraid .) Up the last delicate curl of stairs. He emerges into a soft-sided corridor, cool as ash in winter, and though its dusty, quiet track corners sharply out of sight in the shadows before him, he can feel it stretching on forever, coiled like a bloodless serpent around some terrible center, the thunderous bones echoing back in history: once upon a time, once upon a time . She died out here. ( And they all - ) The faun holds out his hand, and the eldest of his fairies drops into his palm like the most beautiful raindrop. It dances with the pearlescent glory of its wings whispering music, dances right to the tips of his slender fingers. It leaps, reflecting the sunset that burns beyond the labyrinth walls; and then the sun vanishes, and - with a gentle, watery chime - the lovely thing is gone into the ephemeral night. He thinks of beasts. Swift, clever figures bearing the protector's bone, guardians of gateways, valiants and tyrants looming over the steep slope, jaws clenched, wings mantled, fury embodied, the horn, tooth, and tail. He thinks of dear lady sphinx with her riddles, and of bellowing minotaur in a maze of his own, lost inside somewhere or perhaps only hiding from the clamouring sky. The faun knows all about them. As he paces the black paths, they become his companions - those legends, these paths - and he feels the pressure of settling leaves and scurrying mice as a tangible weight on his shoulders. Bones sleep under the solemn earth, under the dying leaves. Old, old bones. He can hear them sighing. ( Sacred now this ground no mortal foot shall tread no mortal breath shall haunt no mortal eye hand tooth flesh none ) His black paths are empty and silent. He guards them from no one, waiting, because that is the way her fairy tale seems to work. Once upon a time, a child with soft, white hands crossed shaded valleys and fields of knotted black thistles to walk fearlessly among the fauns. She touched their lips and kissed their eyelids in greeting, and those who did not fall in love with her instantly fled from the fairybird lightness of her fingers as if in outrage, though truthfully they had never been more afraid in all their lives, and their lives had begun before day birthed the night. It was not Moanna, but the faun thinks she must be just like that long-ago girl. Wise in her stumbling, youthful way; pale as mist; courageous; patient; naive. ( But we are not afraid .) She grows dear to him in her absence; little lost princess, she. On the surface, everything is beautiful because nothing survives for long. The world is a bed of rotting feathers and petals and scraps of skin and threads of hair and those old, old bones, and the faun knows melancholy for the first time, watching it breathe gently and devour. Even the labyrinth walls are coming down slowly, imperceptibly, fragment by fragment pried loose in the wind. The wind howls like grim, grey wolves, stalking empty catacombs and the atmosphere, unchallenged by greater hunters. Sometimes the moon goes out and there are no stars. It does get this dark sometimes. It does. But every spring he shakes the hoarfrost from his beard and leans close to the slick stones where thin, luminous flowers tremble, unfolding from tiny crevices, impossibly alive. For a few days, he will hold them in his hands, the flowers on their stems, and they will bloom in his palms after months of deathly slumber. After months. After a thousand years and all the world's hunters coming out of the deep woods, then creeping silently back in. The flowers return to him in this terrible, glorious place. Generations of sparrows cast their swift shadows across his brow in salute; he gazes up at them patiently, reading their messages on the hot flank of the sky, and smiles a little when they write a name for him because it is quiet and simple, nothing like the old names still echoing in the belly of the earth, but they have so little time to say what they mean, and now they are arcing outward, carrying news of him as far as they can go. He is always humbled when they die, and he says to himself, once upon a time as if it could bring them all back. One day, she will whisper from the winding paths like a ghost to stand before him. Moonlight will make her dark hair shine. He will say; (you've climbed so high. From here, we can nearly touch the clouds. Why did you choose this place?) She will not understand; it was so many lifetimes ago. She will not remember, but she will look at him without fear and reply; (hello.) And he will say; (you are a princess.) The memory of her is precious. He does not clearly remember how to covet, but he covets this, keeps it hidden in a place that no power or endless song will be able to reach. ( Winter is coming .) In the last few years, the sparrows have been bringing tales of a brave young girl to the sky above the labyrinth, and he is certain now that it's her, it's her , flower returning from the barren wastes, long-ago sparrow reborn, and all the deaths have meaning because she is immortal: again, always, after all. ( Winter. Are we only dreaming? ) The faun recognizes her scent, hyssop and white orchid bending bravely in the wind; she is closer than he thinks, he is dreaming and so is she. As he puts his head against the coarse wall and its bed of cold moss, he is no longer in the damp hollow at the very centre of a forgotten maze. This is spring and summer echoing between mountains, with the high grass whispering around his waist, nearly reaching to her slender shoulders, and it swirls like the sea with a current that threatens to carry her away. He dreams that she reaches for a hand to clasp, and he offers his. He dreams that she smiles. And in the dream, her smile lasts forever, and they stand looking out at an ancient, ageless city whose spires and stairways nestle deep in the valley between dawn and the horizon, where the night is not so cold. \"All of it must be true,\" she says; to the city, to the faun. \"We saw it. We were there.\" Immortal flowers kiss her elbows, then nod slowly off to sleep.","LastChapter":"El Laberinto del Fauno/Pan's Labyrinth to Guillermo del Toro. And this is for Lucinda the Maid.

After seeing a lack of pieces about her, here is my attempt to gain a little insight into Mercedes. Please tell me what you think! Constructive comments are much appreciated. Disclaimer: The following is a piece of fanfiction. No money is made off this. There is no copyright infringement intended; all characters, concepts and backgrounds originate from \"Pan's Labyrinth\" and belongs to Guillermo del Toro. The Lack of Mercy Mercedes works in the kitchen. In summer the squat room wavers with muggy humidity; in winter, the cold is soul-chilling, so much that she can see her breath freeze on the air. She breathes out. Her breath hangs in the air, waiting, like a wispy sigh of tobacco smoke. The kitchen's where she clings to the precious little bit of control she needs to keep her head up (to keep her mask on). Move on, she tells herself, move on. There's work to be done. But she doesn't believe in what she's doing. Breakfast for the captain? Yes, sir. A six-course meal in the captain's mess? Yes, sir, no problem. She'll make sure your meal's ready, even if she really only has one or two ration card to work with. But this is the captain's dinner, so when a pig or two (or three) disappears from a farm no one will dare to ask where it went (she's the captain's housekeeper, after all. No one questions her except him. No one will know that one pig never made it onto the captain's fork). No matter what, she'll see a job done until the end. That's her way. She may be subservient to him, but she's not servile. Even so she'll be frantically keeping her head above the water, desperately above the chaos, and when the coffee boils over she won't even notice. The smell of smoke in the air is too thick. With an acidic hiss, a black syrup drips into the flames. Actually, she doesn't really care. There's too much smoke, anyway. Who can tell? She can't see a thing, anyway. The coffee burns. The heat is oppressing. It's much too hot. She feels sweat running down her back. In one moment of heart-leaping apprehension, she wishes she had watched the coffee more carefully. There's so much she has to do, she can't keep them straight in her head, she can't lose her wits now. See, the kitchen's only part of her domain. The men can't be bothered with soft fiddly jobs like laundry and cooking. That's a woman's work. Just as long there's a nice hot bowl of stew and fresh uniforms for them at the end of the day, they don't care what she does, just as long as she does her duty. So they give her the keys. What can one woman do? They laugh tightly at the absurd thought, and then they fall back into obedient silence. (Those who think that way often forget there are knives in a kitchen, knives with blades so sharp that they can slice the head off a hard turnip with a single swift chop. Then the vegetable goes into their stew, and they eat it, without thought, without questions. They forget.) They shouldn't forget so easily, so dismissively, but they do. And they forget Mercedes, lingering in the background, quiet and efficient, unassuming and withdrawn. Mercedes never forgets. She knows each officer with a brutal clarity. She remembers who likes his coffee plain, and who likes his beer warmed over the fire. She also remembers, with a slow deep anger, who shot Frenchie's leg, and who was seen pinning a shrieking young village girl to the wall. Mercedes thinks about what she knows when she's sharpening her knife on a whetstone. Ssniiinngg. Ssnaakktt . She's seething inside that still face, but who can tell? The sound of the knife against stone is like a spoon scraping the bottom of a glass medicine bottle. She's heard that sound once too often, when a dipper scrapes the bottom of a barrel.

After seeing a lack of pieces about her, here is my attempt to gain a little insight into Mercedes. Please tell me what you think! Constructive comments are much appreciated. Disclaimer: The following is a piece of fanfiction. No money is made off this. There is no copyright infringement intended; all characters, concepts and backgrounds originate from \"Pan's Labyrinth\" and belongs to Guillermo del Toro. The Lack of Mercy Mercedes works in the kitchen. In summer the squat room wavers with muggy humidity; in winter, the cold is soul-chilling, so much that she can see her breath freeze on the air. She breathes out. Her breath hangs in the air, waiting, like a wispy sigh of tobacco smoke. The kitchen's where she clings to the precious little bit of control she needs to keep her head up (to keep her mask on). Move on, she tells herself, move on. There's work to be done. But she doesn't believe in what she's doing. Breakfast for the captain? Yes, sir. A six-course meal in the captain's mess? Yes, sir, no problem. She'll make sure your meal's ready, even if she really only has one or two ration card to work with. But this is the captain's dinner, so when a pig or two (or three) disappears from a farm no one will dare to ask where it went (she's the captain's housekeeper, after all. No one questions her except him. No one will know that one pig never made it onto the captain's fork). No matter what, she'll see a job done until the end. That's her way. She may be subservient to him, but she's not servile. Even so she'll be frantically keeping her head above the water, desperately above the chaos, and when the coffee boils over she won't even notice. The smell of smoke in the air is too thick. With an acidic hiss, a black syrup drips into the flames. Actually, she doesn't really care. There's too much smoke, anyway. Who can tell? She can't see a thing, anyway. The coffee burns. The heat is oppressing. It's much too hot. She feels sweat running down her back. In one moment of heart-leaping apprehension, she wishes she had watched the coffee more carefully. There's so much she has to do, she can't keep them straight in her head, she can't lose her wits now. See, the kitchen's only part of her domain. The men can't be bothered with soft fiddly jobs like laundry and cooking. That's a woman's work. Just as long there's a nice hot bowl of stew and fresh uniforms for them at the end of the day, they don't care what she does, just as long as she does her duty. So they give her the keys. What can one woman do? They laugh tightly at the absurd thought, and then they fall back into obedient silence. (Those who think that way often forget there are knives in a kitchen, knives with blades so sharp that they can slice the head off a hard turnip with a single swift chop. Then the vegetable goes into their stew, and they eat it, without thought, without questions. They forget.) They shouldn't forget so easily, so dismissively, but they do. And they forget Mercedes, lingering in the background, quiet and efficient, unassuming and withdrawn. Mercedes never forgets. She knows each officer with a brutal clarity. She remembers who likes his coffee plain, and who likes his beer warmed over the fire. She also remembers, with a slow deep anger, who shot Frenchie's leg, and who was seen pinning a shrieking young village girl to the wall. Mercedes thinks about what she knows when she's sharpening her knife on a whetstone. Ssniiinngg. Ssnaakktt . She's seething inside that still face, but who can tell? The sound of the knife against stone is like a spoon scraping the bottom of a glass medicine bottle. She's heard that sound once too often, when a dipper scrapes the bottom of a barrel. (There's not enough. She'll have to make do.) With a sudden shudder, she remembers Frenchie's screams. Ssniiinngg. Ssnaakktt . The sound grates on her fraying mind. She puts the whetstone down. She reaches for another turnip. With one quick stroke of the knife the head falls off. She stares at the dismembered root. She thinks of Pedro. (Wouldn't it be easy, with a knife this sharp?)

I'm writing a Pan's Pabyrinth fic. The reason for this new obsession; I watched the movie again and I just fell in love. In fact, after watching the movie twice in the same night, I decided to see what sort of fanfics that the movie influenced. In all the fanfics I saw on , most of them centered around the budding, or hidden, relationship of Ophelia(Moanna) and the Faun(Pan). They were all good with different views that seemed so different from another but still captured all of my interests. There were ones that tangled the darkness of nightmares and fantasy with childhood love, some that revealed hidden inhibitions of characters throughout the film, there were ones that unveiled a secret to the birthmark of the moon on Ophelia's shoulder, there were ever ones that had Ophelia asking about who the baby was in the statue of Princess Moanna's arms... where did that come from? Anyway, to continue, there were even ones that told the tale about Moanna's return to the kingdom. I decided to write.. smut. Pure smut. But in this fanfic, I will include revelations. This is a LEMON. This is a LEMON involving MOANNA and PAN. Please read and review after. PS I wrote the dialogue in spanish so to know what they're saying, you have to translate on google languages. Bang! The tough mahogany table slammed against the wall, a long crack growing in length as it pulled away. Moanna, lying on the table with her billowy skirts pulled up high on her waist and her shirt opened up to show off her bare perky breasts, breathed out through a flushed face of blushing red, \"Shhh... shhhh... Silenciosos, querida. O bien todo el mundo nos escuche de nuevo.\" His smooth heavily accented voice that often had a jittery bounce to it heaved harshly in a loud whisper, \"Lo siento, mi princesa, el amor. I. .. No puedo ayudarme a mí mismo. Te quiero para mucho!\" He thrusted himself completely in at the last syllable. She screeched back a scream and tossed her head back as she arched up. Her long wavy brown locks rose up with her, cascading and scratching her sensitive in the moment skin. But his long fingers gently pushed her back, wanting to continue with this and not have her orgasm completely and finish most likely. His hand returned to the edge of the table, hodling it with intent. One of her hands that had been clawing through the table in orgasmic bliss released it's tension and rested heavily against her sweaty forehead. Her eyes shifted throughout the golden room as her breath quickened and her husband continued his ardent thrusting into her. Her toe nails scratched his back as her feet moved up and down. Her legs jerked all about. Another orgasm rolled over her and her gaze melted down to her husband. Pan. Pan, Pan, Pan, Pan, Pan, Pan... The name just rang in her mind. He was older than her, his soul was older than hers, she knew it. He was around as long as her father was, as soon as the world started spinning and life was first breathed into the forest, he existed. She came along a few millenia after. Even if he was older, even if he was a creature rather than... human in what most would say.. she was utterly in love with him. She was in love with him ever since she first met him that night, the night when the fairy had flew into her room and led her outside beneathe the dark night and the shining cresent moon. But... love was not the first thing that had come to her mind then, love grew and blossomed and made itself known to her when she was 16. Now she was 19. But then, when she was only 12... there was amazement, there was disbelief, more importantly, there was familiarity. It was as though she knew him from before, like she had dreamed of him once and it was like their meeting was fate, had already been predicted. That was why she didn't run that night; wasn't even scared though he begged her not to be. She breathed in deep as he unsheathed himself from her slowly, only to charge at her with such ferocity that it made her core burn for him even more. She was a princess; princesses had the finer things in life and did everything by traditions and rules. She had no need for such things; she lived for impulse and adventure. He was what she lived for. She breathed in deep once more, their heavy breathing mixing in together. His smell. She loved his smell. One thing she noticed was that nearly everyone had no smell at all.. they were too clean with nothing that could mark them. She was reminded of dolls; dolls that could move and walk and talk. But he.. he had that earthy smell that tempted her to just roll around and bury herself in that scent like a wild dog. It smelled of Man and Work. It reminded her of the good things in life, the working half that had often been overshadowed by war and many other horrible things. He was as how all Fauns looked, perhaps.. he was even uglier than some of them. But she paid no attention to that; if all the world's romance were revolved solely on looks, could love really exist then? She didn't mind his ugliness at all, he in fact look wiser and more ancient in a mythical way with the moss and flora growing all over his tree-like body. Still, after he married her when she came to age at 18, he groomed himself and washed himself more often, even going far as to wear some sort of clothing on his strong body. Yes.. no matter what, for what he was, she loved him unconditionally. Moanna whimpered suddenly as his tall form just loomed over her, they looked deep into each other's eyes. Her amber-brown ones gazing into his sky blue ones, he smiled deviously. She blushed and turned her head away from his stare. Why did he have to stop? Why couldn't he have just continued? They were both enjoying themselves, they could rest in each other's arms, talk with each other after. But to stop and tease her during their love-making was embarassing for her. She was in her most vunreable position and he was drinking in it while acting so casual about it. \"Por favor, no me mira de esa manera.\" she begged him. She could see from the corner of her eye; he tilted his head, his ears twitching, \"Por qué?\" He knew. He wanted her to admit to him, but she wouldn't give up so easily. \"Porque ... Estoy avergonzado...\" He laughed at her, his stare still burning into her view, \"Usted no parece tan avergonzado anteriores ... Podría decir que usted fue disfrutar más.\" Her eyes rolled back into her head, \"Por favor ... me encanta, me encanta.\" He sighed as he stroked a long finger down the cleavage between her breasts. He bent down lower and kissed the cleavage, sucking away some of the salty sweat as well, \"Por supuesto, mi princesa. Yo vivo sólo para servir a usted.\" He raised himself up and his fingers cracked like breaking wood as he rolled his fingers on the table edge and gripped it tight. \"Moanna!\" he cried as he thrusted hard into her. \"Ohhohh.\" she gasped out as he nailed himself into her. They made love on the table, they often chose to make love that way rather than any other style or on the bed. The bed was impractical in a way; it couldn't really support Pan's weight be it while they were having sexual relations or if he was sleeping. He rarely slept anyway. He always had to be on guard, watching his forest and her. Plus, having getting used to the table way, they could make love almost everywhere. He was taller than her. If they were to do it on the floor, her face would be buried in the high of his abdomen and chest and she wouldn't be able to kiss him during. Moanna was still too innocent to do it doggie-style or attempt bronco-riding. She was inexperienced as well, he knew more about sex than she did and the only way they could comply with the both of their needs would be table wise. He would, as always like habit, waltz her into a vacant room, mostly their bedroom since it had the strongest table. She would act coy as she did, not wanting to seem too horny and submit to him so quickly. But he would get to her quick; bending down to her level, kissing the edge of her neck while skillfully undoing the front of her dress. He would leave her clothes on her, but still take it apart to reveal all he wanted. THen in the midst of their kissing, he would carry her as he did on their wedding night and place her on the table delicatly, the cold wood freezed her hot skin. She would take a deep breath, watching closely as he would unbutton his coat and throw it on the ground without a care. Then, her skirt would be pushed up as she shimmied her body for it to be out of the way on her hips. He would pull her down on the table, her womanhood would meet his area. By pure instinct and reflex, her legs would hook around his waist and her hands would be at the table clawing. He would smile that smile of his and lean against the table to prepare. Then it would start. He charged at her, her toes curling as he did so. She would try not to look directly into his ears, fearing that her shyness would come back and she would cease this pleasure. Instead, she would see him. His beautiful lean torso that was glittered with sweat. She was so tempted sometimes to just raise herself up and lick his entire body, but no.. she couldn't. She wouldn't. She knew that he would probably love it if she did, but.. the thought of it.. the thought of it.. too much! How his chest would pulse like she could see his very heart beat against his ribcage. She wondered if his heart was going as fast as hers would. Then to his strong arms at both sides of her. Those arms were so strong. She could remember one night when she was younger, she was asleep. He carried her in his arms and it was so gentle that she thought she was simply being lulled to sleep by the sea itself. Her dainty fingertips rose up from the table, trembling as she graced the lines printed on his strongs arms. He growled, but not menacingly, more like a purr from a lion. She giggled. His rhythm was steady, making it last longer and feeding the flame within her. The table screeched as it moved across the floor. Bang! They smashed into the wall. She jumped up, still sheathed over him and clutched his strong shoulders. The table was truly a miraculous thing, she could meet him face to face, see eye to eye. As he continued pulping into her, his hands on the table, gripping to keep it from crashing into the wall again, her nails scratched him, leaving welts on his back. He chuckled a throaty laugh, \"Es mi sentimiento más audaz princesa esta vez?\" She breathed out her airless response, \"Puede .. puede .. podemos intentar ... es diferente ... manera?\" One of his hands released the table and went to the small of her back, pushing her up and letting gravity send her down on his hard member. He growled, \"¿Qué quieres, mi princesa?\" Her head bent back as far as it could and she bit him on his collarbone. He groaned outloud. She wondered if he liked it or it hurt. She decided to try it again, nipping him a tad softer again and kissing the area. He groaned and she could feel his abs shaking against her stomach. It tickled her. She kissed his chest over and over, the words coming in between, \"Quiero .. Contra la pared. Por favor.\" He complied quick. He swept her off the table and supported her weight as he swiftly went to the wall. His hand around her back, cushioned the assault. He pushed her higher on the wall so that they were face to face. She blushed looking at him and buried her head in the crook of his neck. She was still too shy for him to look her in the eye. Her legs were wrapped tighter around his waist, clawing into him, while his hands fondled herarse, the dress ruffling as he did so. \"Es a su gusto, mi princesa?\" he grunted as he quickly kissed the top of her head and buried his face in her air, their bodies completely locked together. His movements were smaller, not as big as before, but he could still have her entire being explode into a fierce orgy. The burning inside, the warming glow spearding from her core all throughout to her fingertips and the rest... He was so good! More, closer and closer, she was feeling tipsy. She was going to come any time soon, the climax would boom all over. Her walls closed tighter and tighter around him as his movements were more graceful with agression, going as deep, as far as he could inside her. \"Ohhh..oohh....\" she groaned outloud in his ears as she came, her walls were shut around him and she could feel him shaking against her. He must have been close as well. He shoved into her one last time and he shook so violently that it was as though he was being possessed. But the shaking stopped with a long siiighhh. \"Eso fue asombroso.\" he murmured as he carefully set her down on the floor, sinking with her as they rested against each other. She kissed him on his smooth cheek and reminded, \"¿Te acuerdas de la segunda vez que nos vimos?\" He nodded his head, \"Sí, ¿cómo olvidar?\" She giggled a bit and kissed him on his chin, \"Usted me mostró una estatua de mí cuando yo era la Princesa Moanna. Usted me dijo que la niña era yo y que estaba de pie justo detrás de mí.\" \"Sí, la estatua que se hizo cuando no eran más que 50 años. Usted todavía tan pequeño entonces.\" Time moved differently in the Underworld. The people down there counted years as humans would count days. 10 years in the Underworld could've passed and to the humans it would've been about a century. \"Había un bebé en mis brazos y no responder cuando le pregunté.\" His tone sounded a little bit nervous, \"Usted sólo una niña cuando nos reunimos antes de que regresó de nuevo. Pensé que usted no necesita saber mucho más detalles sobre su vida personal hasta que yo sabía que estabas realmente la princesa.\" She breathed out, \"Ese es nuestro bebé, ¿no es así. Ya sabía que me enamoré de ti ... todos sabían, ¿verdad?\" \"Sí, todo el mundo lo sabía. Pero, cuando usted era joven, usted no lo sabía. Que eran tan inocentes entonces, incluso un niño aún cuando desaparecieron. ¿Puedo simplemente decirle, una niña que ella ya estaba prometida a un fauno que era tan antiguo como la Tierra, las estrellas, tan antiguo como su padre? NO, he optado por permanecer como su tutor y esperará a que crezcan. Pero su curiosidad le llevó lejos de mí antes de que usted puede crecer. No es una gran sorpresa que figuraba que el bebé estaba por el momento.\" he verfied. His hand suddenly went to her bare breast and he started fondling her, \"¿Por qué plantear el tema ahora? ¿Quieres un niño ahora?\" She kissed him on the lips, \"Estoy embarazada.\" And that's it. I don't think I'm going to continue this fic. Hope you enjoyed it. Please review.","LastChapter":"Disclaimer: Ngoc Chau does not own Pan's Labryinth So.. I'm writing a Pan's Pabyrinth fic.

Usted todavía tan pequeño entonces.\" Time moved differently in the Underworld. The people down there counted years as humans would count days. 10 years in the Underworld could've passed and to the humans it would've been about a century. \"Había un bebé en mis brazos y no responder cuando le pregunté.\" His tone sounded a little bit nervous, \"Usted sólo una niña cuando nos reunimos antes de que regresó de nuevo. Pensé que usted no necesita saber mucho más detalles sobre su vida personal hasta que yo sabía que estabas realmente la princesa.\" She breathed out, \"Ese es nuestro bebé, ¿no es así. Ya sabía que me enamoré de ti ... todos sabían, ¿verdad?\" \"Sí, todo el mundo lo sabía. Pero, cuando usted era joven, usted no lo sabía. Que eran tan inocentes entonces, incluso un niño aún cuando desaparecieron. ¿Puedo simplemente decirle, una niña que ella ya estaba prometida a un fauno que era tan antiguo como la Tierra, las estrellas, tan antiguo como su padre? NO, he optado por permanecer como su tutor y esperará a que crezcan. Pero su curiosidad le llevó lejos de mí antes de que usted puede crecer. No es una gran sorpresa que figuraba que el bebé estaba por el momento.\" he verfied. His hand suddenly went to her bare breast and he started fondling her, \"¿Por qué plantear el tema ahora? ¿Quieres un niño ahora?\" She kissed him on the lips, \"Estoy embarazada.\" And that's it. I don't think I'm going to continue this fic. Hope you enjoyed it. Please review.","Summary":" Disclaimer: Ngoc Chau does not own Pan's Labryinth So.. I'm writing a Pan's Pabyrinth fic.

His \"pan\"hoodnbecame like a steel rod and he couldn't stand it anymore. He liftednher skirt and shoved his hand up until he found his prize, drippingnwet, hot, and ready. MoAnnangasped and clutched Pan as hard as her small frame would allow. Pannpushed two of his long into her and pumped them into her until shencame all over his fingers.

Though he does not believe that any of his own men would approach him from that quarter, Vidal keeps watch over those empty spaces, that flat looking-glass staring back at him like a great, blind eye. There are people in this compound that he does not possess as wholly as others. Soldiers and cooks and cleaning maids who keep their gazes respectfully downcast; but when he does catch a glimpse of them catching a glimpse of him, he sees their eyes like mirrors showing him an empty room, and he thinks: Mirror-people, inhabiting far-away places while their flesh makes its way numbly through the tangible world. Unfocused, unambitious. They are not to be trusted. Mercedes has a cat's mouth. She is clever enough to capture her words one by one like little prey things; but if they are mild she lets them go free. Even when her eyes flash as violently as a distant storm stirring along the flanks of the sky, she bites down on the thunder, swallows it whole. Not a single thread of ill temper has tangled her voice for months. She would be pretty with her lips painted and her lashes dusted dark as meadowlark wings, but cosmetics are as tightly rationed as anything, and those that Vidal can offer freely must go to Carmen. Children's books have been set on a corner of the kitchen table, and when he makes a comment about them, Mercedes sweeps them up in her long arms and shuffles them out of sight, saying: \"I'll remove them immediately, Señor.\" He takes his seat, palming the armrests where the sun has warmed them. \"I do not tolerate disruptions. You know that. I have no time to waste; and now I have no appetite.\" \"Please, Señor. We wouldn't know what to do with ourselves if you didn't take your breakfast as usual.\" He would never admit it, but he is grateful for her, for Mercedes. Without her, he doubts that anything in the household would ever be finished. The meals would go unprepared, the daily chores would never be assigned or addressed, the buildings and vegetable gardens would fall into terrible disrepair as though the whole countryside was inhabited only by rebels and ghosts. Very little power rests in her hands, and yet she is the part of the string that holds the knot together. It is not fondness that he feels for her so much as it is the sort of calm reliance that the wolf must feel for his thick winter coat. He eats what she sets before him while fingers of sunlight creep across the table thoughtfully. A stack of old newspapers and typed reports wait at his elbow, and he spends some time going through them, only to find that there is a slender book among them that he does not recognize. He knows what time it is simply by the movement of the sun, but he checks his father's watch regardless. Deciding that he has time to read a little longer, he flips the cover open, scans the pages. When Mercedes comes to collect the dishes, he puts the little volume of fairy tales down in front of her. She looks at it for a moment in silence with her hair lit like a halo and her shoulders set sharp as a falcon's brow. \"I'm sorry, Señor,\" she says. \"I hadn't realized there was another.\" \"It's fine,\" he tells her, and watches as she folds it into a pocket of her apron. She keeps her head down, but he still has the impression that she is angry. Her hands dart swift and sharp; her cat's mouth pinches shut around some insubordinate thought. He feels the urge to smile at her displeasure, and chooses not to indulge it. Instead he stands up and puts his cap on neatly, pausing in the doorway until Mercedes looks up again, meets his eye squarely and with the fierce focus of a mountain lion. \"Be sure that the little girl is not permitted in the kitchen, pantry or dining room outside of meal times,\" he says. Her face in shadow, Mercedes takes a long time to nod an assent. But, eventually and inevitably, she does. Vidal does smile at her then, faintly, and steps out to meet the fresh scent of the forest and the industrious sounds of the morning she has made for him. An empty cradle; a child who runs away to live in the woods like an animal, or stands in the corner and speaks to nothing. He cannot abide such things; but there are other, more immediate worries to distract him indefinitely. For one thing, Carmen is unwell again, wearing her weakness like beloved shawl, as if she has always been ill and always will be. At her gentle insistence, Vidal is persuaded to believe that this is normal - or, at least, acceptable so long as the Doctor is close and alert to her condition. Vidal occasionally visits her himself in the smoky darkness of her room and talks about the progress he has made in the training of a young, beautiful colt given to him by the General. He does not know if she has any interest in riding, and it seems to him that her body and her bones would shake apart on the shoulders of the powerful mares boarded at the stables in wartime. \"What will it be like here in the winter?\" she asks abruptly, and he expects himself to be irritated with her; she sounds as though she was not listening at all. An unusual tranquility overtakes him, however, when he thinks about the drifting snow and glittering, operatic winds. He and his forces will be coiled up indoors, like a hunting dog sleeping by the hearth, while the world fights his battles for him. Knowing that she might become anxious at a comment of this nature, he only says: \"It's quite beautiful here after the first storms have passed.\" She smiles. \"Ofelia will have a wonderful time, I think. In the city, there was only ever frozen mud and dirty banks of snow alongside the road. Here, she'll have the chance to see a real winter.\" \"It will be very cold,\" Vidal says flatly. \"And dangerous for her.\" \"We will look after her, and she will teach her little brother to talk a little before spring comes again.\" Wandering off into the black spaces between trees, calling to things that have no name or loyalty. \"You should rest,\" he replies. All of her stories and fantasies are familiar to him. Know your enemy , he might have said to explain himself, but the truth of it is that he was a child like any other once, and his mother read the old tales to him while he was still too young to know any better than that. Ancient meadows and starless nights were in his dreams when he was a boy. He knows all about princesses and knights with helmets shaped like a dragon's sneering face; he simply stopped believing in them, long ago, when he saw the look of contempt on his father's face as he said, bedtime stories and lies fit for little girls. And so they were. For Carmen's sake, he pretends not to overhear Ofelia when she trails the maids and tells them stories about river gods and prophecies and monstrous voices that bubble up from beneath the wooden floors, but ignorance - even when it is feigned - does not sit well with him. His senses are his weapons; he is aware, and uses his awareness to make a kingdom of his surroundings, no matter how spare or lavish they may be. Turning his head away when a girl speaks of creatures with horns that curled back like the devil's makes his blood stir with dark disquiet. He feels, abstractly, as though he has become her accomplice, and learns to mistrust her smiles. They are always turned toward empty spaces and pale shadows, as though she has been wandering on the other side of the mirror all along. And as Ofelia's eyes grow more distant and blind; and as Carmen slips deeper into her velvet-lined illness; and as the mirror shows him a room filled with the flickering shapes and suggestions of treachery, he remembers one thing that the fairy tales did impart to him with some wisdom: Demons often take the most unlikely forms.","LastChapter":"The mirror shows him an empty room and the shape of his own shadow, cast back on its heels against the wall where the oily lamplight is busily attempting to corner it.

Princess Moanna settled next to her guardian, her head resting on his leg. After her reincarnated body, named Ofelia, was killed by that hijo-de-puta captain and she returned to her kingdom, she spent many hours celebrating her coming home with her family and their subjects, the faun always watching. Her exhaustion plainly showed through her joy and the celebration was ended; she needed rest before she could once again sit properly on her throne at her father's side. Rather than make the long trek to her own chambers, she had found her way to the faun's side and asked if he would keep her company; she knew that her mother and father would not worry if she was in his care. With a smile and a bow, he had agreed. He sat at the center of the labyrinth, the maze that had and would continue to serve as his domain and her playground, his back against the stone carving of himself and the royal children, and his princess's head in his lap. He stroked her hair with his impossibly long fingers and hummed a haunting lullaby until her eyes closed and he heard her breaths become deeper and slower. The faun let out a content sigh, glad to have his princess back home and by his side. So absorbed in his delight was he that he did not notice the fairy approaching him. It flitted up to his eye level, glancing from him to the girl in his lap and back to him, a knowing glint in its eyes and the air of 'I know a secret about you' filling its features. The faun angrily swatted at the pest. \" Vete !\" he growled. One well-timed pass of his hand sent the fairy spiraling out of sight. Silence settled back in the labyrinth, only broken by the princess's soft breaths and an occasional sound from the faun that could only be described as a purr. He looked up to the moon, a mere sliver of its full glory, as it sailed through the starry sky. His lips curved up in a genuine smile as his gaze fell to the young girl's brightly-clad shoulder, thinking of the crescent-shaped mark that adorned her skin beneath the fabric of her gown. He doubted that she knew its true meaning: that she was his and no other's. The princess was still too young to be courted, but he would personally see to it that any male who challenged his claim would not leave the palace with his head intact. He knew that even though the king and queen had promised their beloved daughter to him when she was of age, they would still go through the formality of searching for a suitable mate for her. However, they would not prolong the farce, knowing of the faun's possessive nature; he would maim any boy that attempted to win her hand and appeared to succeed. He growled low in his throat at the notion that a human would try to take what was his. He lost her once to her own curiosity when she ventured Aboveground; he would not lose her to an inferior male, especially when she was promised to him at her birth! Such violent thoughts did not suit him at this moment; the faun banished them from his mind. Instead of lingering on such destructive fantasies, he focused his gaze back on the slumbering figure of his princess and the smile returned to his face.

True, she was still a child herself, but she was fast approaching womanhood as well. It would not be long before he was allowed to act on his right to her. A sigh rattled from his throat as he thought of what lay just outside his grasp, conveying so many emotions that no human could comprehend. He became suddenly aware of the sensitivity of his fingers as their tips slid sensually, yet with a veneer of innocence, over her golden gown and through her chocolate locks. The sensations he felt through simple touch were like heaven; he had never experienced textures such as those of the princess's dress and hair, and he relished the contact. The faun craved the feeling as a dying man craves life; the desire to have her forever in his arms and at his side pushed itself to the forefront of his thoughts, eliciting yet another sigh. \" Mi princesa, \" he whispered tenderly to the sleeping girl. \" Por cuanto tiempo me hace sufrir? Cuando puedo tenerse por fin? \" As if in reply, the princess shifted in her sleep, turning to lie on her back. Her eyes were still closed and her breaths remained deep and even. The faun smiled again at her unconscious display of blind trust in him. He absolutely loved her vulnerability; it gave him reason to be around her for hours at a time, gave him something to protect. All thoughts of her future courting fled before the image of her lying on her back at his side, her hand coming up to light upon his leg, her tiny fingers holding a power over him that he found both strange and comforting.

Maybe,nmaybe he could even remarry, to someone who will be a good mother fornhis boy. Someone who could teach the morals he doesn't possess. Someonenwho could teach him, to be good. Atnthe funeral, his eyes wonder across to the girl again, and then up tonthe woman standing over her. Mercedes. Henstudies her face for a long time, ignoring the drone of the priestnlamenting the death of a woman he knows he never loved. She's notnbeautiful, at least not in the way Carmen was, but she has dignitynand grace in her features which is suddenly very attractive to him.nShe's certainly very competent, in all the time she has run hisnhousehold his only complaints have been over burnt coffee. He alsonknows she cares for the girl, and her motherly instinct is clearly onndisplay here, as she adopts a protectivenstance and rests a comforting hand on her young ward's shoulder.nShe is kind. She is calm. She is loyal. Innmany ways, she is his opposite. Andnshe is good. Thesenthoughts continue into the evening as he watches her tend to thenbaby. She uses soft, hushed words, and her face carries a loving andntender expression. For a second he feels disappointed that she'snnever worn it for him, but then, why would she? He allows himself anmoment to imagine her being tender to him, kissing his cheek,nstroking his hand, loving him. Wouldnshe accept him, he wonders, if he asked her to marry him? He can'tnpretend she'd consent out of any feelings for him, or even anyndesire for wealth or position- that's not her way. But there is anchance she would, so as to stay close to the children. Butnhe can't become distracted by these fantasies now. Now, he has tonbe sure. The rebel had said there was an insider, someone from hisnvery household, someone close to him. He is still smart, and nonmatter what he may want to imagine, only a very few people here couldnbe that well informed. Asnhe questions her, the fear in her voice is almost tangible, but it'snher reaction to his remark about the lock which confirms hisnsuspicion. By the time she leaves the room, he is certain. Shenis not loyal, after all. Whennhe captures her is the forest, he is not surprised to see she hasnbrought the girl as well, rather, he is surprised the child followednher so readily. Andnthen it dawns on him. Shenknew. Mercedesnis a traitor, and the brat knew all along. He could have swallowednhis pride if it had been just her and the doctor, but she had toldnher little friend all about how they were tricking the stupidnCaptain. He can just imagine them now, laughing at him. Henis seething by the time he arrives at the barn, but is calmed when hensees her. She is being tied up by Garces, her face empty of allnemotion. It seems she is not going to put up a fight. Herndefeat makes his anger turn upon himself. How could he have been sonfoolish? He trusted this woman, unwittingly letting her in on all hisnplans. He had even fantasized, hoped, of marrying her. He thought shencould save him. Andnall this time she had hated him. Well,nif that was indeed the case, he will give her just cause to do so. Henwill make her scream, and sob and beg to die. He will avenge the hopenshe doesn't know she's crushed. Hendismisses Garces. The Sergeant is uncertain, but after all, henassures him, she's just a woman. That'snwhat you've always thought. That's whynI was able to get away with it. I was invisible to you. Asnshe speaks, she refuses to look at him, maybe she believes that ifnshe does she'll loose her nerve. However, despite himself, he'snimpressed. She's right; she has been able to get around him becausenshe's quiet, sensible and good at her job. She used his own pridenagainst him. Andneven now, tied up and awaiting torture, she still surprises him, andnhe is more attracted to her then ever. He can't resist touching hernface, turning it into a grab and a sneer so she doesn't suspect hernpower over him. For the briefest of moments, he considers kissingnher, just to see what she tastes like, but he resists, and insteadnmoves over to his tools. Henrecites his long rehearsed speech mostly for something to say, shenwon't tell him anything, he's sure. As he does though, he can'tnhelp but wonder how she would react if he just took her now. It wouldnsurely condemn whatever part of his soul he still had left, and itnwould not be tender, or loving, or anything close to what he hadnwished for, but if she could not be mother to his son, his caringnwife, at least now he has an opportunity to feel her beneath him,nhave her warmth surround him. Wouldnshe let him, or would she fight? She may want to let him get it overnand done with, her spirit may be so crushed that she'd just lienthere. But then, she may not be as defeated as she appears. Atnthis thought, he gasps in shock and pain as a knife enters hisnshoulder. He turns to see her standing before him, her binds cut, herneyes now fixed on him. She stabs him again, and again. The wounds shengives him are precise, but not fatal. She doesn't want to kill him. Shenwants to torture him. Henfinally drops to the ground and stares up at her. Mercedes towersnover him, hatred and anger gleaming in her eyes. It is not fear thatnholds his gaze, it's awe. Thendark angel places her knife inside his mouth and holds it to theninside of his cheek as she hisses at him. I'mnnot some old man! Or a wounded prisoner! Motherfucker... Don't youndare touch the girl. You won't be the first pig I've gutted! Withnthese words she rips through his cheek, and as he screams in pain henis dimly aware of her escape. Henorders his men to fetch her back, the fury almost blinding him. Henwill capture her again; he will take his time and break her. Hernsobbing will be his symphony, and he will conduct it with joy. Andnwhen she is so broken that she cannot even cry anymore, he will makenher his. Andnthe girl? The girl can watch. Hencontemplates everything he will do to the both of them as he standsnat his mirror, examining her handiwork. The familiar face before himnnow has a sickening half grin, like that of deranged clown. Henstitches it diligently, wincing every time the needle enters hisnskin, all the time playing out his revenge in his head. First,nhe'll force her to look on as her precious Ofelia is beaten. He'llntell her that it will stop, as soon as she tells him everything henwants to know. But when she does, he thinks gleefully, he'll tellnher that he doesn't believe her, before beating the brat again. Andnthen... and then he'll send his men away, and he'll forcenMercedes to the ground. She'll try to fight him, but fear for thengirl will control her. No doubt she'll tell her to turn away, butnthe child won't be able to. He will enter her, and delight in hernattempts not to look at him, her weak arms trying to push him away. Hisnfantasy is cut short by a stabbing pain from his wound- as he downs anglass of liquor, and it forces him to examine his face once more. Henstares into himself and is repulsed by what he sees, shame creepsnunder his skin and starts to itch. This is not professional. It isnnot logical, it is not smart, it is not neat. He isn't a good man,nbut he will not allow himself to lose hold of what he is. The womannis a criminal,nnothing more. She will be caught, interrogated and executed. That isnall. The girl knew, yes, and he must find out how much she knows now,nbut she is a child. His son's sister. Henmust think of his son. Andnthen the news comes. Mercedes has escaped, safe among her people. Ifnshe has any sense, she'll be on her way out of the country by now,nbut then, she may come back for the girl. Andnthen everything happens so quickly. The noise. Ofelia standing there,nterror etched on her features like glass. His son in her arms. Softnbut undefeatable slowness taking control of his limbs. Henfollows her into the crumbling maze, desperately fighting his bodynfor control- he must get his son back, he is all that matters. Hencan't help but feel that the stones are working against him, hidingnhis son from view. And then he finds them. Ofelia is having annargument with herself, the child clearly mad. There is nothing he canndo for her. Unflinching, he takes back what is his and shoots thengirl. Hisnson is all that matters now. Asnhe walks slowly back, he is conscious that the noise has stopped. Andnthen he sees her. She stands among her comrades, victorious. They allnwait patiently for him to approach, safe in the knowledge that hencannot touch them. It occurs to him that he has never seen her looknso beautiful. He calmly hands her his precious bundle. Strange,nhe thinks, she will be mother to his son after all.

Maybe,nmaybe he could even remarry, to someone who will be a good mother fornhis boy. Someone who could teach the morals he doesn't possess. Someonenwho could teach him, to be good. Atnthe funeral, his eyes wonder across to the girl again, and then up tonthe woman standing over her. Mercedes. Henstudies her face for a long time, ignoring the drone of the priestnlamenting the death of a woman he knows he never loved. She's notnbeautiful, at least not in the way Carmen was, but she has dignitynand grace in her features which is suddenly very attractive to him.nShe's certainly very competent, in all the time she has run hisnhousehold his only complaints have been over burnt coffee. He alsonknows she cares for the girl, and her motherly instinct is clearly onndisplay here, as she adopts a protectivenstance and rests a comforting hand on her young ward's shoulder.nShe is kind. She is calm. She is loyal. Innmany ways, she is his opposite. Andnshe is good. Thesenthoughts continue into the evening as he watches her tend to thenbaby. She uses soft, hushed words, and her face carries a loving andntender expression. For a second he feels disappointed that she'snnever worn it for him, but then, why would she? He allows himself anmoment to imagine her being tender to him, kissing his cheek,nstroking his hand, loving him. Wouldnshe accept him, he wonders, if he asked her to marry him? He can'tnpretend she'd consent out of any feelings for him, or even anyndesire for wealth or position- that's not her way. But there is anchance she would, so as to stay close to the children. Butnhe can't become distracted by these fantasies now. Now, he has tonbe sure. The rebel had said there was an insider, someone from hisnvery household, someone close to him. He is still smart, and nonmatter what he may want to imagine, only a very few people here couldnbe that well informed. Asnhe questions her, the fear in her voice is almost tangible, but it'snher reaction to his remark about the lock which confirms hisnsuspicion. By the time she leaves the room, he is certain. Shenis not loyal, after all. Whennhe captures her is the forest, he is not surprised to see she hasnbrought the girl as well, rather, he is surprised the child followednher so readily. Andnthen it dawns on him. Shenknew. Mercedesnis a traitor, and the brat knew all along. He could have swallowednhis pride if it had been just her and the doctor, but she had toldnher little friend all about how they were tricking the stupidnCaptain. He can just imagine them now, laughing at him. Henis seething by the time he arrives at the barn, but is calmed when hensees her. She is being tied up by Garces, her face empty of allnemotion. It seems she is not going to put up a fight. Herndefeat makes his anger turn upon himself. How could he have been sonfoolish? He trusted this woman, unwittingly letting her in on all hisnplans. He had even fantasized, hoped, of marrying her. He thought shencould save him. Andnall this time she had hated him. Well,nif that was indeed the case, he will give her just cause to do so. Henwill make her scream, and sob and beg to die. He will avenge the hopenshe doesn't know she's crushed. Hendismisses Garces. The Sergeant is uncertain, but after all, henassures him, she's just a woman. That'snwhat you've always thought. That's whynI was able to get away with it. I was invisible to you. Asnshe speaks, she refuses to look at him, maybe she believes that ifnshe does she'll loose her nerve. However, despite himself, he'snimpressed. She's right; she has been able to get around him becausenshe's quiet, sensible and good at her job. She used his own pridenagainst him. Andneven now, tied up and awaiting torture, she still surprises him, andnhe is more attracted to her then ever. He can't resist touching hernface, turning it into a grab and a sneer so she doesn't suspect hernpower over him. For the briefest of moments, he considers kissingnher, just to see what she tastes like, but he resists, and insteadnmoves over to his tools. Henrecites his long rehearsed speech mostly for something to say, shenwon't tell him anything, he's sure. As he does though, he can'tnhelp but wonder how she would react if he just took her now. It wouldnsurely condemn whatever part of his soul he still had left, and itnwould not be tender, or loving, or anything close to what he hadnwished for, but if she could not be mother to his son, his caringnwife, at least now he has an opportunity to feel her beneath him,nhave her warmth surround him. Wouldnshe let him, or would she fight? She may want to let him get it overnand done with, her spirit may be so crushed that she'd just lienthere. But then, she may not be as defeated as she appears. Atnthis thought, he gasps in shock and pain as a knife enters hisnshoulder. He turns to see her standing before him, her binds cut, herneyes now fixed on him. She stabs him again, and again. The wounds shengives him are precise, but not fatal. She doesn't want to kill him. Shenwants to torture him. Henfinally drops to the ground and stares up at her. Mercedes towersnover him, hatred and anger gleaming in her eyes. It is not fear thatnholds his gaze, it's awe. Thendark angel places her knife inside his mouth and holds it to theninside of his cheek as she hisses at him. I'mnnot some old man! Or a wounded prisoner! Motherfucker... Don't youndare touch the girl. You won't be the first pig I've gutted! Withnthese words she rips through his cheek, and as he screams in pain henis dimly aware of her escape. Henorders his men to fetch her back, the fury almost blinding him. Henwill capture her again; he will take his time and break her. Hernsobbing will be his symphony, and he will conduct it with joy. Andnwhen she is so broken that she cannot even cry anymore, he will makenher his. Andnthe girl? The girl can watch. Hencontemplates everything he will do to the both of them as he standsnat his mirror, examining her handiwork. The familiar face before himnnow has a sickening half grin, like that of deranged clown. Henstitches it diligently, wincing every time the needle enters hisnskin, all the time playing out his revenge in his head. First,nhe'll force her to look on as her precious Ofelia is beaten. He'llntell her that it will stop, as soon as she tells him everything henwants to know. But when she does, he thinks gleefully, he'll tellnher that he doesn't believe her, before beating the brat again. Andnthen... and then he'll send his men away, and he'll forcenMercedes to the ground. She'll try to fight him, but fear for thengirl will control her. No doubt she'll tell her to turn away, butnthe child won't be able to. He will enter her, and delight in hernattempts not to look at him, her weak arms trying to push him away. Hisnfantasy is cut short by a stabbing pain from his wound- as he downs anglass of liquor, and it forces him to examine his face once more. Henstares into himself and is repulsed by what he sees, shame creepsnunder his skin and starts to itch. This is not professional. It isnnot logical, it is not smart, it is not neat. He isn't a good man,nbut he will not allow himself to lose hold of what he is. The womannis a criminal,nnothing more. She will be caught, interrogated and executed. That isnall. The girl knew, yes, and he must find out how much she knows now,nbut she is a child. His son's sister. Henmust think of his son. Andnthen the news comes. Mercedes has escaped, safe among her people. Ifnshe has any sense, she'll be on her way out of the country by now,nbut then, she may come back for the girl. Andnthen everything happens so quickly. The noise. Ofelia standing there,nterror etched on her features like glass. His son in her arms. Softnbut undefeatable slowness taking control of his limbs. Henfollows her into the crumbling maze, desperately fighting his bodynfor control- he must get his son back, he is all that matters. Hencan't help but feel that the stones are working against him, hidingnhis son from view. And then he finds them. Ofelia is having annargument with herself, the child clearly mad. There is nothing he canndo for her. Unflinching, he takes back what is his and shoots thengirl. Hisnson is all that matters now. Asnhe walks slowly back, he is conscious that the noise has stopped. Andnthen he sees her. She stands among her comrades, victorious. They allnwait patiently for him to approach, safe in the knowledge that hencannot touch them. It occurs to him that he has never seen her looknso beautiful. He calmly hands her his precious bundle. Strange,nhe thinks, she will be mother to his son after all. Henmakes his final request of her, but is cut short. No.nHe won't even know your name. Andnhe knows why.","Summary":" AN;nI really don't know how this became so long, but here it is.

Who wouldn't want a hotnhalf Albanian gymnast in a skimpy cheerleading outfit for their very own?nAnyway, they aren't mine, I don't know who owns them. Whoever you arenthanks; and my birthday is coming up. *hint hint* I'm watching my lover sleep; her blonde hair spread on the pillow like spunngold. Her eyes, closed now, are the deepest pools of cornflower blue. Insmirk self depreciatingly. Cornflower? I knew crayons were educational. Butnback to her skin, white as porcelain, soft and smooth as silk, and a lotnmore fun to touch than either. Insert lecherous smile here. But it's notnjust about the fun, or letting off smoke after cheerleading, it's so muchnmore. \"Hey.\" I look down into sleepy eyes. \"Hey back.\" I say. Not original ornvery romantic, but she'll forgive me for it. \"What were you thinking about so hard? I saw the smoke coming out of yournears,\" she grins naughtily as she says this. I give her a playful swat on her ass for that, then settle back down tonanswer her question. \"You.\" \"And what about me?\" Smiling softly at me, she perks up to listen. Shenloves this game. \"How perfect you are. How perfect this is. How I wish it would stay.\" \"And why can't it stay this way?\" She doesn't want to have thisnconversation. \"Because Torr. It's like that poem says 'nothing gold can stay'.

I don'tnknow about the last part, but I know I'll do my best, so I pull her into mynlap and she leans her head against my shoulder. We are still unabashedlynnaked, as only those who are completely comfortable with each other are.nShe is never like this with him, I know. \"I wish we could love, but one of these days my brother is going to decidento wake up before noon and I don't think he'd take well to finding hisngirlfriend naked in bed with his little sister.

I don't say this. Instead Insay, \"I love you too.\" \"Now that that's settled it's time for other business.\" \"Other business?\" I feign ignorance.

Without flowery words or gestures,rnshe can make me smile by just being her. \"What werernyou thinking about so hard? I saw the smoke coming out of your ears.\" I grinrnsaucily at her. That earns me a quick smack on the ass. Just hard enough tornnotice it. She doesn't hurt me. Despite her badass persona, I know she wouldrnnever hurt me. She answersrnthe question though. \"You.\" \"And whatrnabout me?\" I want to know. She says the sweetest things, but that's not why Irnlove this game. When she's talking about how she feels about me, she just getsrnthis glint in her eyes that's only for me and it makes me feel like I can dornanything, just because she loves me. \"Howrnperfect you are.

I probably opened a can of worms with the plot twist I tossedrnin, but oh well… The early afternoon sun is streamingrnthrough the windows when I stumble into the den and see my sister and a blondernthat my sleepy mind eventually identifies as my girlfriend. My girlfriend, whornif the pajamas she is wearing can be considered an indicator, spent the nightrnhere last night unbeknownst to me. Huh… I jump over the back of the couchrnand land next her. \"Hey babe. I didn't know you stayed.\" She glances at Missy beforernreplying, \"We were talking and it got late. It was easier.\" I accept that answer. It's happenedrnbefore. More often here lately, though with graduation in a couple of monthsrnTorr is probably worried about the squad for next year. The squad that *shock*rn*horror* my sister is probably going to be captain of. May we all quake inrnfear. \"Wanna do something today Torr?\"rnIt's Saturday afternoon and we usually do something. There is a battle of thernbands about an hour up the highway that I'd like to take her to. Another glance at my sister beforernshe says anything. That's just weird. \"Actually Cliff, could we talk to yournabout something?\" Oh no. Hell no. Not again. She sworernshe wouldn't do it again. But the surreptitious glances and this sudden need torntalk? Maybe I'm imagining things. \"Sure. Just let me get some orange juice fromrnthe kitchen.\" They both nod and all of a sudden Irndon't want the juice. I've got that sick feeling you get when you knowrnsomething isn't going to end well. Carefully schooling my features to remainrnnonchalant I get off the couch, kissing Torrance on the cheek as I go. I've gotrnto get my kicks somehow and if she's going to break my heart I'm sure as hellrngoing to make her feel bad about it. And hey, if she's not then I'm still therngood boyfriend. I pour the juice quickly and comernback to find them sitting next to each other like they are trying not to touch.rn\"So what's up?\" I will not make this easier for them. \"Cliff,\" Torrance begins and Missyrnputs her hand on Torrance's thigh for support I hope. \"I really like you. Yourngave me the confidence to be the captain I needed to be. You got me over Aaronrnand you made me really happy whenever we were together.\" I nod. \"Good to know. But there is arnbut in here somewhere, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that itrninvolves my *sister* since you said that the two of you needed to talk to me.\" Torrance's face falls at my tone,rnand Missy looks from her to me and apparently comes to a decision as shernstands. \"You're trying to force her to sayrnit aren't you? You are deliberately hurting her. I never expected it of you.\" \"You never expected it of me sisterrndear?\" I ask. I'm pissed off now. She's the one that told me to go afterrnTorrance. \"Damn it Cliff, she didn't mean tornhurt you. WE didn't mean to hurt you.\" \"Oh so the two of you just happenedrnto fall into bed together,\" I sneer. \"Or was it just like last time with Kylarnwhere it happens once cause you're drunk and the sex is so great that you decidernto keep fucking behind my back for months?\" From the look on her face I went toornfar. Missy is fit to kill, and Torrance doesn't look much happier. \"Shit Miss. I didn't mean to bringrnup Kyla. That was a low blow.\" It was especially since it's only been about arnyear since she died. Missy still blames herself cause Kyla was on the way tornpick her up when she was in the car accident that killed her. She shakes her head dismissively.rn\"That still doesn't change the fact that you promised though Missy.\" \"I know it doesn't Cliff, but do yournhonestly think I did this just to hurt you?\" \"I think what hurts the most is thatrnI know you didn't.\" I turn to leave so I don't have to watch my now ex-girlfriendrngather my sister - her new girlfriend - into her arms to cry.[Chapter 4] Author'srnnote: I'm back and determined to finish this ficrnwithout taking another lengthy absence from fandom.

With a jolt, she looked up from the dusty ground and saw her servant and companion towering over her. With a tilt of his head, he smiled in his usual, enigmatic way. Extending his arms and regally bowing, he murmured, \"It is cold, Your Highness. Nights in the Underworld Kingdom are beautiful, but can sting your skin.\" His bark-like, hard fingers gently moved his present closer around her neck. As he did so, he felt that her shoulders were clammy and near-frozen, as he had suspected. Princess Moanna, once regarded as Ofelia during her stay on Earth, glanced down at his hand and noticed a strange shawl that was barely held together by thin, luminescent threads that hung in a familiar pattern. \"A spider's web?\" she questioned as she fingered the oddly warm shawl. \"Four years,\" the Faun's smile widened, \"You have dwelt here for almost four years ... and things that are commonplace still amaze you.\" Indeed, it had been almost four short years since Moanna's human body had perished, allowing her to take her rightful place as the princess of the Underworld Kingdom. She had become a young lady that was almost sixteen years old, and it showed. Even so, her voice had hardly changed from its quiet, innocent lilt. \"Is it normal for clothes to be made of a spiderweb?\" Moanna wrinkled her nose, trying to picture a modest garment made out of the silk. \"Normal, yes,\" the Faun answered, \"But like the cloth of the Earth, the ...\" Stroking his beard, the Faun tried to find a word that would eloquently finish his sentence, \"...Quality differs. A nobleman would wear a web far different from you, Princess. Would you be surprised if I told you that that lovely dress of yours was made out of a spider's string?\" Moanna stood up and looked down at one of her regal gowns. It was not as intricate as the ones she wore in court, but it was still breathtaking. It was the inky color of night, and had a train almost as long as the tail of a drake. \"I'm guessing it's like any other kind of thread, then?\" inquired Moanna. The Faun nodded before picking up one of her slim hands. He always marveled at the softness of her skin, especially compared to his. He creaked his neck closer to her digits before abruptly stopping and stating, \"We'd better go inside. You do not want to be tired tomorrow.\" Moanna pouted, but she obeyed. Standing up, she wrapped the shawl closer to her skin and picked up her train in one of her arms. The Faun walked a little ways behind her, a servant in his place. Moanna looked back at him, a bit confused by his stance. But, that was the Faun. Choosing not to question him, she walked ahead into her castle. As she was enveloped by her ladies-in-waiting, the Faun stayed behind and watched his princess get shooed away. She was almost out of his hands entirely. Only three more days, and he would probably never see her again.[Chapter 2] ¿Unión En Tres Días? Nighttime was always a pleasure in the Underworld Kingdom. Princess Moanna's dreams were so vivid that all five senses felt real to her. If she was in a field of butterflies, she could feel each one of their kisses on her bare skin as she ran through. If she was in front of a feast of delectable chocolates and candies, her tongue would taste each one as they melted on her tongue. She could always feel the Faun's reassuring hand on her shoulder, and those dreams gave her the most comfort. She was having one of those dreams tonight, where she was curled by the Faun's body. Memories of his first caress, their first hug, it all flooded back to her mind in these dreams. Come to think of it, they hadn't hugged in a few months. The Faun had been rather distant to her... even in this dream his eyes flicked from her to the open space. It was different, and unsettling. Moanna sat up in her bed, her brow furrowed. The smell of breakfast already wafted into her room, and tempted the princess with sweet smells. Swinging her legs over the side of her bed, Moanna let her feet sink into the elaborate rug by her bed. She quickly stepped into one of her dresses and let the soft fabric drape over her like she was a Grecian goddess. She finished off the look by setting the Faun's shawl over her shoulders. She nuzzled her cheek into the silk, inhaling the earthy scent of the Faun. Her troubles led away by the mist of the Underworld morning, Moanna opened up the grand doors to her bedroom and stepped into one of the long, curving halls of the castle. Her ladies-in-waiting were all in a line to take her to her breakfast, but when they saw her, their eyes widened. \"You're still wearing that silly peasant's shawl!\" one of them giggled, \"I know that you were being polite last night, but don't you think this is a bit much?\" \"That disgusting Faun,\" another one shook her head, \"What does he think he's doing? You aren't a child anymore, he shouldn't lay a finger on you!\" Moanna stared at her murmuring ladies in waiting, her jaw lax from surprise. \"Why do you talk about my friend in such a cruel way?\" she asked as she fingered her shawl. One of the ladies-in-waiting sighed and tried to gently take it away while chiding, \"That Faun thinks that he's so high-and-mighty, but he's lower than even our bath cleaners. Why do you think we had him wait on the Earth for you for so long?\" Supposedly there was no pain in the Kingdom, but Moanna felt something very similar stab at her when her servants said those things. \"Please... don't say such things,\" Moanna pleaded, giving the closest thing to an order that she could. So grateful and new was she, that she didn't have it in her heart to take these things for granted. Everything, even the littlest things, she said with a 'please' and a 'thank you'. The ladies-in-waiting looked at her with doting eyes, all smiling. \"Oh, we didn't mean to upset you,\" said one of them, \"Besides, soon you won't be giving that Faun a second thought.\" The other women giggled, like they had a juicy piece of gossip that they were going to suck dry. They didn't bother to explain further, instead they ushered their princess into the grand dining hall where she was to eat her breakfast. If only Moanna had known what feasts awaited her, the Pale Man's meals would've looked like slop in her eyes. A bowl filled with creamy rice pudding sat in front of her. Glittering strawberries laid on top of it like diamonds would accent a golden necklace; it was almost too pretty to eat. Moanna usually ate her breakfast hungrily, though, however today her spoon sat dormant. The princess was worried about what her ladies-in-waiting had said earlier, and it was affecting her stomach in a negative way. Carmen was practically translucent as she walked in to join her daughter. Sunlight bounced off of her hair and skin, making her gleam like an angel.","LastChapter":"¿Unión En Tres Días?

Ofelia – \"No,\" she reminded herself, \"Princess Moanna\" – only knew that she was almost asleep on her feet and that in her old world it must have been the middle of the night. The celebration had lasted for hours; everyone wanted to welcome and worship their returned little princess. She was introduced to countless people (all who seemed remarkably familiar), feasted until she could not eat another morsel (although she avoided the grapes, which conjured up frightening memories), and danced, mostly with the Faun (who, despite being significantly taller than her, seemed to fit her perfectly). It had been fabulously entertaining, but now she was sleepy, and the festivities did not appear to be slowing in the slightest. Moanna yawned loudly from the spot on the floor she had sat on out of sheer exhaustion, and the Faun looked down at her, a comforting smile on his face. \"Tired, Your Highness?\" He sounded like the earth and the water and forgotten, favorite fairytales, and she tilted her head and smiled back. \"Mmm-hmm.\" \"Come with me then,\" he said gently, taking her hand and helping her to her feet. \"I will take you to your chamber.\" She let him lead her through the twisted maze of a castle, refusing to let go of his hand for fear of stumbling in the dark. The dark itself was consuming, seeming to press down on her eyes until the dark of the night and the dark of her closed eyelids were indistinguishable. She stumbled and awoke half a minute later in his arms, the clacking of his hooves the only sound as he carried her down the hallway. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" she mumbled, clumsily rubbing her eyes, \"I guess I'm sleepier than I thought.\" She yawned again, and he chuckled and turned into a doorway on the right. She could not make out the details of the room but could see the outline of a bed, which was all she needed at the moment. He placed her on the luscious, almost feathery comforter, and she found herself missing the embrace of his rough, tree-like arms, comfortable though her bed was. How peculiar. Then she hardly remembered he was there at all and began to slip her gown off, almost trancelike, so she could finally fall asleep. She had only succeeded in uncovering her shoulders when his strangled cry of \"No, Princess!\" broke through her foggy daze. She stopped and looked up at him in alarm and was surprised to see the spiral markings on his forehead glowing a faint blue. The moon marking on her shoulder was also glowing, she noticed, and she stared at him, puzzlement written in her childish eyes. \"I-I'm so sorry, Your Majesty,\" he said ashamedly, hanging his head. \"You were not supposed to find out so soon.\" \"Find out what?\" \"This.\" He touched her shoulder, and it seemed to burn under his fingertip. \"The moon.\" He touched his forehead. \"And the ocean.\" \"The moon and the ocean?\" she repeated. \"You mean, the tides?\" He nodded and then paused, mentally gathering his words before continuing. \"You and I, Your Highness, have a…a connection. One that has been since the beginning of time and will remain until the end.\" \"Oh.\" She lowered her head to the silken pillow and closed her eyes. For a moment, he thought she had fallen asleep, when she asked, \"What kind of a connection?\" \"Oh, Princess,\" he murmured, \"I wish that you did not have to know, not now. I wanted to shield you from the knowledge until it was more…favorable.\" She opened her eyes and gestured for him to continue anyway. He gingerly sat on the edge of the bed and took one of her small hands in both of his. \"Moanna,\" he spoke, and she was faintly surprised that he said her name without a formality attached, \"we are fated to be…I suppose 'married' is the term you would comprehend the most.\" This time, her eyes nearly doubled in size, all traces of exhaustion momentarily vanished. \"Y-you mean, we are betrothed?\" she stammered. \"No, no, not 'betrothed'. Simply destined. It is going to happen, regardless of any conflicting circumstances.\" \"But I…I'm just a little girl! I'm only twelve years old!\" she exclaimed. \"And you, well, you must be hundreds of years old-\" \"Ah,\" he said, waving his hand dismissively. \"Time, ages, they have no place in the Underworld. You have been here just as long as I, Your Highness.\" He tapped the tip of her nose and grinned. \"Perhaps you are older!\" She knew he was teasing her, and she giggled. Then his expression saddened, and her laughter ceased. \"You are correct, though,\" he said softly, disappointment evident in his voice. \"When you ran away, your form was much older. Not quite ready, but in about a season or two-\" He closed his eyes and broke off for a moment. \"We knew you might return in a different body. I was prepared for that. But I never envisioned…a mere child…\" He looked at her hurriedly. \"Not that it is any of your fault, my Moanna. You are still Moanna; the body is nothing but a physicality. But you must understand…I have waited for so long …and waiting is torture.\" \"Waiting for what?\" she asked innocently, and he laughed bitterly. \"The fact that you don't know proves that you are too young.\" \"Maybe if you show me-\" \"Do not tempt me, little Princess,\" he said quickly, removing her hand from his. \"It would not be right. You are not ready…and, for that matter, neither am I.\" \"No?\" she questioned curiously. \"I have to grow up, but what is it that you have to do?\" He turned and smiled. \"Do you find me handsome?\" \"No,\" she said truthfully, and he nodded. \"Fauns are stunning creatures, flawlessly beautiful even,\" he explained. \"Perfect in a way mortals never can be. But staying on Earth, waiting for century after century, battered by time and the elements-\" He flicked his shoulder, and a section of the bark-like exterior fell away to reveal smooth, pale skin. \"-it took its toll.\" \"Then why did you wait for so long?\" He touched her cheek, and she couldn't help but to lean into his touch. \"Because I love you,\" he said simply, \"since the beginning of time until the end.\" She smiled. \"That's very sweet of you.\" \"Oh, don't worry about not loving me back,\" he said kindly, \"you will soon enough. I used to look very much like your fairytale's Prince Charming: young and agile and…\" \"…and charming?\" she finished. \"Yes, and charming.\" \"Marrying Prince Charming would be nice,\" she confessed, \"although I think I would love you even if you stayed just as you are.\" \"You are very kind, Princess Moanna.\" He bent down and dared to place a delicate kiss on her cheek then gasped as she flung her arms around his neck. \"I suppose if I have to be destined to marry someone,\" she whispered into his long, blond hair, \"you are the best I could have.\" Then she let him go and closed her eyes. He strode to her door, slightly overwhelmed and was about to leave when he heard her ask one final question. \"That baby I'm holding…in the statue with you and me…it's our baby, isn't it?\" He smiled. \"Yes, Princess. He will marry the fairy that brought you to me.\" She laughed sleepily, already drifting off. \"But she's so small…\" He shrugged and exited the room. \"She too will have to change. Goodnight.\" Then he closed the door and was gone. \"I'm twelve,\" she mumbled then corrected herself. \"I'm in an twelve-year-old's body . And princesses are married when they are sixteen.\" Suddenly, four years seemed a terribly long time, and as she finally slipped into sleep, she hoped that time in the Underworld passed a bit faster than time on Earth. The End[Chapter 2] Ebb Moanna tiptoed down the black hallway, hoping she really was as silent as she thought she was being. This was madness, shear madness . And here she went doing it anyway, her continuing feet not caring about the madness in the slightest. She knew the way exactly, two years of following the same route having cemented the path into her mind. She had never actually been inside his bedchamber though. He had never expressly forbid her from entering, but he had also never invited her inside. She only knew the way because she constantly came there of her own accord, flying down the castle's passages until she could hammer on his door and ask for him to come out and visit. He would have come visit with her regardless of her eager summoning, but the second she was awake, she couldn't think of anything else she wanted to do besides see him. And so almost every day for the two years since she had come home to the Underworld, her morning started with her knuckles rapping on his wooden door. But this time, it was the middle of the night. This time, she was not a little girl anymore. This time, she wanted to give him everything that had alluded him for so long. Her hand raised to knock, but she dropped it at the last moment. He might not answer or worse, he might hold the door shut so she couldn't get in. That she was destined to marry him never fazed her, never troubled her like he always seemed to be sure it would. It was just a pleasant, little fact that played around in her mind as she played around with him during her childhood. Oh, she would marry her dear friend, and wasn't that nice, and they would have a little baby, and wasn't that nice too? The only fear she ever had over the arrangement was that of childbirth and blood, but there was no pain in this world, so that fear quickly diminished until she could hardly remember ever having it. She clutched the golden doorknob with a fervor that surprised her. The cloud that had hung over her happy fantasy picture had always been his look. His look, his longing, his lingering. There was something that he wanted - needed, she almost wanted to say - and it pained him to his core, and she had been powerless to help him. He helped her with everything, and the one thing that it seemed only she could help him with, she could not. Oh, how she wanted to, to ease his suffering! But how could she when she had not had the slightest idea what it was he needed, and he refused to tell her? She turned the knob and slid into the room, slowly, slowly closing the door behind her. It was a bit brighter in here, some light from outside making its way through the window. His chamber was almost barren, but there were so many leaves and roots and twigs and soil strewn about that the room hardly felt empty. The only furniture wasn't furniture at all. A large...nest, she would call it, for lack of a better word...hung from the ceiling by thick vines. That's where he was, but she only stood and observed for a moment. Two years had changed him, even more so than they had changed her. Two years had given her womanly curves and a womanly mind to accompany them, two years had practically given him a complete transformation. Practically because there was still some bark, his hair was still somewhat matted, he still managed to give people a bit of a fright when they first saw him. Her hair was long and wavy down her back like her mother's had been. She looked two years older, and he looked what must have been a century younger. He had asked her once if she found him handsome. Her answer had been no, and her answer was still no but the most tentative no because she could more than see how magnificent the end result would be. Her attraction to him had little to do with his looks anyway. It had to do with his tone and his soul and his mannerisms. It had to do with things that were ancient and earthy and secret. It had to do with his ocean to her moon. She was at the edge of the nest now. It was made of furs and sticks and feathers, and it was soft, and the whole bed swung slightly as she climbed up. He stirred, his eyes twitching behind their lids, but he remained asleep; she crept closer and gently touched his cheek. He jerked awake. \" Moanna... \" His voice was deep with sleep and what she now recognized as desire, and she shivered. \"Moanna?\" Now he sounded more like himself, soothing and concerned. \"Are you alright? What is wrong?\" \"I'm fine.\" She traced a finger up and down his arm, feeling the muscles move under the tip. \"But you are not.\" \"Me?\" He appeared confused, an always-amusing thing to see on his usually self-possessed visage. \"You haven't been fine for a long, long time.\" \"Your Highness-\" He chuckled good-humoredly. \"-I assure you, I am just fine. Shall I walk you back to your chamber?\" \"When did you know that we were fated to be together?\" \"I-\" He chose to not ignore her question. \"I can't remember not knowing.\" \"But when was that?\" \"...a long, long time ago.\" \"You haven't been fine for a long, long time.\" \"Perhaps not,\" he said hurriedly, \"but do not trouble yourself with the feelings of a sentimental faun like me.\" \"But I-\" \"I'm going to walk you back now.\" There was determination in his voice, and she wondered if the statement was to convince her or himself. He moved to get up, and she speedily put a palm on his chest and pushed him down. \"No.\" She did not have even a fraction of his strength, but her determination was stronger than his. She hadn't come this far to be turned away. He just stared up at her with wide eyes, a hundred conflicting emotions rendering him paralyzed. \" Pan ,\" she breathed, coming dangerously close to him, \" I know what you want. \" She was kissing him. He was still for more than a handful of moments. \" No... \" His hands were on her shoulders, but he was pushing her away with zero enthusiasm. Then, \" Please... \" He brought a hand to his forehead as if ashamed that the plea had been spoken. \" Moanna...you can't know...tell me you don't... \" \"I do.\" She pressed herself flush against him and could feel his heart thundering against her chest. \"And I want it too.\" \"I-I'm sorry,\" he rambled. \"You must think me vulgar and carnal and-\" \"I think that you are in love and have been for enough time that other men would have been driven insane.\" \"Insane.\" He scoffed. \"And who says I am not? You have no idea...you cannot comprehend how I have burned for you.\" She was frightened by his intensity, but it turned to a kind of thrilling burning of her own. \"You are not ready. You are going to leave now, and tomorrow we will fail to mention that this happened, and you will never come here again.\" \"You can't make me.\" She kissed him again, pushing against his lips with a ferocity that shocked him. \"Do you think you are tortured now? I will mention this tomorrow and the next day and forever. I will never give you a moment's rest. And you will break, I know you will, I don't care how long it takes.\" \"You give my self-control entirely too much credit,\" he said in a whispered hiss, and she was on her back, her hands grasping desperately onto his horns as his mouth moved with hers. It was eternal and powerful and gently beautiful and over too soon. \"I can't,\" he gasped, severing the bond. His eyes were clutching at something that looked like fright or maybe temptation. \"My Princess, I can't.\" \"Why-\" \"I've waited forever, surely two more years are manageable!\" She cupped his cheek sympathetically. \"You know that's a lie.\" \"A lie? I could wait another eternity if that was what you wanted.\" \"But it's not what I want. I want you.\" She leaned up into him, and she heard him groan. \"Please.\" \"You will have me one day.\" \"You would deny me?\" She was hurt, and she let it show. \"You would put me through the agony you are so familiar with? How can you, if you love me?\" \"I can precisely because I love you.\" The firmness in his tone made her shrink back a bit into the feathery bed. \"Because I love your honor, and I love your virtue. Because maybe I would...I would love to watch you experience the agony that I have. Because then when the restraints are lifted, and we can have each other freely, it will be...\" \"What.\" She was hardly breathing, hanging on his every word. \"What will it be.\" \"Perfection.\" He grazed his lips against hers. \"I will make you-\" His fingertips brushed against the peak of one heaving breast through the thin fabric of her nightgown, one by one. \"-feel magnified in reality-\" He ground himself against her, and she practically cried in frustrated pleasure. \"-what you could only dream of imagining.\" \"Two years?\" Her mouth hung open sorrowfully. \"Oh, Pan. How can I?\" \"If you promise to go when I tell you to, if you promise to leave me be, perhaps I can-\" He smiled. \"-do little things every once in a while to lessen the ache.\" She awoke in her room the next morning, lips swollen and hair disheveled. His words came floating back to her. \"I could never deny you completely.\" The End","LastChapter":"Ebb Moanna tiptoed down the black hallway, hoping she really was as silent as she thought she was being.

Adrian looked down for a second before replying, \"I suppose.\" She cleared her throat as Rocky took a long drag and they kept on walking down the row of apartments in his shabby old neighborhood. She didn't know where they were going exactly; at first, she thought he was going to walk her home after their short ice skating date. But this wasn't Adrian's neighborhood. She'd watched Rocky stroll down it many times before, and then watch him duck inside a doorway. But she wasn't familiar to this neighborhood. A few dozen yards away, a small group of college-aged guys were humming a tune over a lit oil drum while drinking some liquor. \"I say you're very shy by nature, you know?\" Rocky broke the silence, and Adrian let out a small laugh as she looked at the ground and scratched her head through her hat. \"I suppose,\" she said, just as a man walked out of the alleyway shadows and exchanged a nod with Rocky. \"Hey, hey. The bum from the dark,\" Rocky said as the guy walked away. \"Get a job, you bum!\" Once he was gone, Rocky continued his conversation with Adrian. \"Some people think that being shy is a disease, you know, but it don't bother me none.\" \"It don't bother me either,\" Adrian said back, even though she mentally kicked herself for saying it. It did bother her. She had grown to dislike her shyness over the years, and only wished to get rid of it. Thing was, though; she didn't know how. Rocky mentally kicked himself too, and turned to her. \"So why'd I bother bringing it up, huh?\" Without waiting for a response, he added, \"Cause I'm dumb, that's why. I think we make a couple of real sharp coconuts. I'm dumb and you're shy. What do you think, huh?\" Adrian changed the subject quickly. \"I don't understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter.\" \"Hey, you gotta be a moron. You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter. You know what I mean? It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.\" Adrian looked up at him and a tiny smile formed on her lips. \"I don't think you're a bum,\" she said softly. Rocky, taking no notice that she was being sincere, shrugged. \"Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know. But I'll tell you something,\" he stopped at one of the many apartment doorways and fished the cigarette out of his mouth, \"the worst think about fighting is the morning after.\" Adrian stopped walking and looked at him. \"Morning after?\" \"I'll tell you. Yeah, the morning after a fight, you're nothing but like a large wound, you know what I mean?\" She shook her head. \"Sometimes I got pains all over me. I feel like calling a taxi to take me from the bed into the bathroom. You know what I mean? Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face is all busted up, you're hands are swollen. Look at this face. Sixty-four fights. Look at that nose. You see that nose?\" Adrian nodded. \"That nose ain't ever been broken. Sixty-four fights. I had guys busting on it. I had guys chewing on it, twisting and punching on it.\" He made some punching motions with his fist. \"I mean, whack, boom. These guys are hitting my nose all the time. Never broke. I'm very proud of that.\" He scrunched up his nose and began to touch it a bit. \"Ain't that rare? That's rare.\" Adrian looked at her feet, and then back up at him. \"Why do you do it if it hurts?\" \"Why do you think?\" He turned and climbed up the steps of the staircase that led to one of the apartments. Adrian stood at the bottom of the steps, thinking. \"Cause you can't sing or dance?\" \"Yeah, something like that.\" He opened up the screen door and asked, \"Hey, you wanna come inside?\" Adrian's smile quickly faded and she took a small step back. \"No, I gotta go,\" she said quickly. She hadn't ever been inside a man's apartment before, not to mention alone. Rocky was persistent. \"Hey, c'mon. I got some animals. I got these rare, very rare animals inside. Come on, come on in.\" Adrian turned down the offer. \"No. No, I gotta go.\" Rocky turned towards the door again. \"I gotta go, too. I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.\" Adrian managed a smile and even chuckled a bit, but it soon faded too. \"No, I gotta go.\" Rocky pointed at his face. \"Hey, look at this face. Is that a face you could trust or what, huh? Is it? They ought to stick this face on a stamp. What do you think?\" She softly laughed and shook her head. Rocky motioned for her. \"Come on. Come on in.\" With that, he went inside, leaving her there to ponder at the bottom of the steps. Moments later, Rocky poked his head out and motioned for her again, his cigarette hanging off his lip. \"Yo, come on.\" He ducked back inside. Adrian still hesitated. His arm shot out from the doorway and opened the screen door a bit wider. Then it reclined back inside. Adrian looked down at her feet and thought about what she was about to do. Paulie had warned her about guys before. Guys who lured in girls like her. \"Guys'll try 'n get in your pants,\" a not-so-drunk Paulie told his sister one night while watching TV. \"You better watch out for them free-feelers. They're all the same, you know.\" He took a drag of his cigarette while Adrian quietly watched TV. Paulie then laughed. \"Who am I kidding? No one in their right mind would ever be stupid enough to take you anyplace. Forget what I said.\" It didn't hurt her feelings back then, but now that she was actually in one of those situations, she figured there could be some truth behind what her brother was saying. But she knew Rocky. Not all that well, but she figured he was pretty nice. The man liked turtles, for crying out loud. Adrian took a deep breath and trudged up the stairs and into his apartment. Rocky flipped the lights on and Adrian stepped inside his apartment, taking in the boxer's home. She heard the door close and looked behind her to see Rocky locking it. She nervously stepped back. \"Yo, Adrian, you hungry?\" he asked, and she said no. \"I got some things in there. I got, uh…if you like sodas, donuts or something. Got a couple cupcakes, huh?\" He took of his leather jacket. \"I think I got some chocolate in there. No?\" Adrian stayed quiet as she watched him hang up the jacket and his hat and lifted his shirt and sweater up and over his head, leaving him wearing a white wife-beater. \"Hot in here, you know?\" Adrian held her breath, her eyes taking in his muscles and biceps. She'd been used to seeing his arms covered, but she didn't know how strong he was until now. \"I could go for some music.\" Adrian looked at her feet again as Rocky turned on the music. Soft jazz floated through the air, and Adrian looked up to see Rocky, now at a table, holding up a small turtle. \"Yo, Adrian. These are the exotic animals I was telling you about. These are my friends, Cuff and Link.\" Adrian mentally rolled her eyes. \"I sold them to you.\" \"I know you sold them to me. Remember, you were working at that pet shop, huh?\" Yes, I remember, Adrian thought. I still do. \"First day you was there and I came in and bought both these animals, huh? Sure, I remember that. I came and I bought this bowl, and I bought the, uh, animals themselves. Some food, the marbles that go on the bottom there. Remember that mountain? I had to get rid of that mountain though, cause they kept falling over and flipping. You know what I mean?\" He put the animals back, wiped off his hands, and then sat down on his couch. There were beer empty bottles stuck in between the couch cushions and the wall. There were crumpled newspapers covering up the holes in the old, beat up couch. A crumpled dirty blanket made up for a missing cushion next to Rocky. \"Yo, why don't you come on over here and sit down? Hmm?\" he invited. Adrian stayed put. \"It's a nice couch, I don't know.\" Adrian almost laughed at that one. It was not a nice couch. \"There's big bugs in there, you know,\" he said. \"It's safer over here.\" Adrian chuckled and looked down again. \"You wanna sit down?\" Rocky asked again. Adrian took a few steps, then looked around a bit to try and look for something. Something she could bring up, or something that she could just…anything that would distract her from sitting down next to the man. Something caught her eye and she turned to see her reflection looking back at her. All over Rocky's mirror were pictures. Pictures of him, boxers, football teams, older people, couples, even one or two of his turtles. She saw one of two older people, a couple. \"Um…these, these your parents?\" \"Yeah, that's both of them there,\" he answered from the couch. \"This you?\" she asked, taking a pictures off the mirror and gazing at it with interest. It was a young boy, frowning at the camera. \"Yeah. That's me when I was eight-years-old. That's the Italian Stallion when he was a baby. Why don't you come over? Make yourself comfortable. Relax.\" Adrian put the picture back and looked back at Rocky. She bit her lip and asked politely, \"Do you have a phone?\" Rocky shook his head. \"No, I got no phone. I had it pulled. Cause people calling all the time, and uh, who needs the aggravation, right? Interruptions.\" He then looked straight at her. \"Who'd you wanna call?\" \"I wanna let my brother know where I am.\" \"Why?\" Adrian swallowed and searched for an answer. \"I think he might be worried.\" Now, she knew perfectly well that Paulie wouldn't give a damn where she was at that moment. More than likely, he'd already be drunk by now, and in no mood to hear his little sister's voice. Adrian wanted to tell him she was over with Rocky, but she half-expected him to yell at her and tell her that she should be with him instead of calling him up. \"Well, I'll call your brother if that's the problem,\" Rocky offered and hopped up from the couch. He opened up the window and shouted into the night, \"Yo, Paulie. You're sister's with me! I'll call you back later! See ya!\" He closed the window and turned to face Adrian. \"What's the matter? You don't like the room, do you?\" \"It's fine.\" \"It's only temporary.\" \"It's not that…\" Adrian's voice trailed off before she could say what it was that was bothering her. It was just…she was nervous. She hadn't ever been in a man's apartment before…and she wasn't sure about being in someone like Rocky's home either. Rocky came towards her and then reached up to lean on the pull-up bar above Adrian's head. \"What's the problem, you don't like me? You don't like the turtles? What's the problem?\" Of course I like you , she wanted to say, but the words caught in her throat and she thought up new ones to replace them. \"I don't think I belong here.\" \"It's okay.\" She turned away for a moment before looking at him again. \"I don't belong here,\" she said straightforwardly. Rocky let go of the bar and approached her; she stayed perfectly still. \"Well, you know, it's okay, cause you're my guest.\" Adrian looked down and sighed. \"I don't know you well enough. I've never been in a man's apartment…alone.\" Rocky shrugged. \"Well, I have. They're all the same, you know?\" Adrian tensed up. They're all the same, you know . Paulie had said that. Oh, God, I need to get out of here, she thought, and said to Rocky, \"I'm not sure I know you well enough. I don't feel comfortable.\" Rocky came a bit closer. \"Yo, Adrian, I ain't so comfortable either.\" Too close , she thought, and turned to leave. \"I should go,\" she said and went for the door. Rocky was right behind her. He intercepted her by placing his hands on either side of her head, blocking her from the door. \"Don't go. Please, don't go. Don't go.\" Adrian froze and shrank back a little in the corner. She was terrified now. She looked up at Rocky, ready to tell him to let her go, but didn't have the time to do so because that's when he asked her, \"Do me a favor?\" \"What?\" \"Take off these glasses.\" He didn't give her any time to do so before he took them off himself, exposing her beautiful brown eyes. She looked down at the floor. \"You have nice eyes, you know?\" Rocky dipped two fingers under her chin and gently tapped it up so that she could look back at him again. She wanted to look away again, but instead, she held his gaze. Those brown eyes of his…they were beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Why hadn't I noticed them before? She asked herself. \"Do me another favor?\" he asked, and Adrian prayed he wouldn't ask her to take off anything else. \"Why don't you take off that hat?\" Again, he reached up and slipped it off her head without waiting for her to do it. Her dark hair fell over her face, and she brushed it back. \"I always knew you was pretty,\" Rocky said. Disbelievingly, Adrian shook her head and said timidly, \"Don't tease me.\" \"I'm not teasing you,\" Rocky said sincerely. \"I ain't teasing you.\" He leaned in closer. \"I just…I wanna kiss you. You don't have to kiss me back if you don't wanna, but I wanna kiss you.\" He can't be serious , Adrian thought, but all hopes of him bluffing soon faded as he leaned in, and Adrian thought she might pass out from all this. She turned her head and tried to shrink back, but Rocky was persistent, and kissed her cheek, his lips barely grazing hers. He kissed her softly and then took a moment to look into her eyes. She looked back, and he leaned in again. Adrian didn't know what happened, but she didn't turn away this time. His lips were on hers, but she hesitated and met his lips for only a second or so before she broke it and looked down. That was her first kiss. Rocky then leaned in even closer this time and Adrian met him halfway through this time. Adrian put more passion into it and Rocky deepened the kiss. He gently pushed Adrian against the wall and stroked her arms softly. They both sank down to the floor as Adrian wrapped her arms around him and he did the same. He caressed her face and then gently broke the kiss, looking deep into her eyes. Adrian placed her hand over his and stared back. \"Yo, Adrian. I think this is a good time to tell you I love you, you know?\" A small smile appeared on her lips and she gave him a passionate kiss on the lips. \"I know. I love you, too.\"","LastChapter":"\"You know, some people are very shy by nature, you know?\" Rocky said before he struck a match and lit his cigarette. Adrian looked down for a second before replying, \"I suppose.\" She cleared her throat as Rocky took a long drag and they kept on walking down the row of apartments in his shabby old neighborhood. She didn't know where they were going exactly; at first, she thought he was going to walk her home after their short ice skating date. But this wasn't Adrian's neighborhood. She'd watched Rocky stroll down it many times before, and then watch him duck inside a doorway. But she wasn't familiar to this neighborhood. A few dozen yards away, a small group of college-aged guys were humming a tune over a lit oil drum while drinking some liquor. \"I say you're very shy by nature, you know?\" Rocky broke the silence, and Adrian let out a small laugh as she looked at the ground and scratched her head through her hat. \"I suppose,\" she said, just as a man walked out of the alleyway shadows and exchanged a nod with Rocky. \"Hey, hey. The bum from the dark,\" Rocky said as the guy walked away. \"Get a job, you bum!\" Once he was gone, Rocky continued his conversation with Adrian. \"Some people think that being shy is a disease, you know, but it don't bother me none.\" \"It don't bother me either,\" Adrian said back, even though she mentally kicked herself for saying it. It did bother her. She had grown to dislike her shyness over the years, and only wished to get rid of it. Thing was, though; she didn't know how. Rocky mentally kicked himself too, and turned to her. \"So why'd I bother bringing it up, huh?\" Without waiting for a response, he added, \"Cause I'm dumb, that's why. I think we make a couple of real sharp coconuts. I'm dumb and you're shy. What do you think, huh?\" Adrian changed the subject quickly. \"I don't understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter.\" \"Hey, you gotta be a moron. You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter. You know what I mean? It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.\" Adrian looked up at him and a tiny smile formed on her lips. \"I don't think you're a bum,\" she said softly. Rocky, taking no notice that she was being sincere, shrugged. \"Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know. But I'll tell you something,\" he stopped at one of the many apartment doorways and fished the cigarette out of his mouth, \"the worst think about fighting is the morning after.\" Adrian stopped walking and looked at him. \"Morning after?\" \"I'll tell you. Yeah, the morning after a fight, you're nothing but like a large wound, you know what I mean?\" She shook her head. \"Sometimes I got pains all over me. I feel like calling a taxi to take me from the bed into the bathroom. You know what I mean? Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face is all busted up, you're hands are swollen. Look at this face. Sixty-four fights. Look at that nose. You see that nose?\" Adrian nodded. \"That nose ain't ever been broken. Sixty-four fights. I had guys busting on it. I had guys chewing on it, twisting and punching on it.\" He made some punching motions with his fist. \"I mean, whack, boom. These guys are hitting my nose all the time. Never broke. I'm very proud of that.\" He scrunched up his nose and began to touch it a bit. \"Ain't that rare? That's rare.\" Adrian looked at her feet, and then back up at him. \"Why do you do it if it hurts?\" \"Why do you think?\" He turned and climbed up the steps of the staircase that led to one of the apartments. Adrian stood at the bottom of the steps, thinking. \"Cause you can't sing or dance?\" \"Yeah, something like that.\" He opened up the screen door and asked, \"Hey, you wanna come inside?\" Adrian's smile quickly faded and she took a small step back. \"No, I gotta go,\" she said quickly. She hadn't ever been inside a man's apartment before, not to mention alone. Rocky was persistent. \"Hey, c'mon. I got some animals. I got these rare, very rare animals inside. Come on, come on in.\" Adrian turned down the offer. \"No. No, I gotta go.\" Rocky turned towards the door again. \"I gotta go, too. I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.\" Adrian managed a smile and even chuckled a bit, but it soon faded too. \"No, I gotta go.\" Rocky pointed at his face. \"Hey, look at this face. Is that a face you could trust or what, huh? Is it? They ought to stick this face on a stamp. What do you think?\" She softly laughed and shook her head. Rocky motioned for her. \"Come on. Come on in.\" With that, he went inside, leaving her there to ponder at the bottom of the steps. Moments later, Rocky poked his head out and motioned for her again, his cigarette hanging off his lip. \"Yo, come on.\" He ducked back inside. Adrian still hesitated. His arm shot out from the doorway and opened the screen door a bit wider. Then it reclined back inside. Adrian looked down at her feet and thought about what she was about to do. Paulie had warned her about guys before. Guys who lured in girls like her. \"Guys'll try 'n get in your pants,\" a not-so-drunk Paulie told his sister one night while watching TV. \"You better watch out for them free-feelers. They're all the same, you know.\" He took a drag of his cigarette while Adrian quietly watched TV. Paulie then laughed. \"Who am I kidding? No one in their right mind would ever be stupid enough to take you anyplace. Forget what I said.\" It didn't hurt her feelings back then, but now that she was actually in one of those situations, she figured there could be some truth behind what her brother was saying. But she knew Rocky. Not all that well, but she figured he was pretty nice. The man liked turtles, for crying out loud. Adrian took a deep breath and trudged up the stairs and into his apartment. Rocky flipped the lights on and Adrian stepped inside his apartment, taking in the boxer's home. She heard the door close and looked behind her to see Rocky locking it. She nervously stepped back. \"Yo, Adrian, you hungry?\" he asked, and she said no. \"I got some things in there. I got, uh…if you like sodas, donuts or something.

I'm here.\" The dark haired figure said quietly as he approached the spot that he usually spent most of his spare time, and set up his folding chair. He hadn't been there all that much in the last couple months though. Since he had begun training for the upcoming fight against Dixon, training's almost all that he did. \"Balboa vs. Dixon\" was the big fight that everyone was talking about since it was between an iconic legend from yesteryear and the world champion today. The fight was three days away, and Rocky was just hours away from leaving for Las Vegas where it was going to take place. But right now, the Italian Stallion was where he wanted to be, and with whom he had always been with before a fight… He was with his wife. The quiet atmosphere in the cemetery hadn't changed at all in the couple months he had been scarcely there. It was still silent, and all those gravestones stood tall, looking over the people that were buried beneath them, and over those living who visited them, creating an air of peace. Rocky placed the dozen red roses he was holding gently upon his wife's headstone with a kiss and sat down upon the creaky folding chair with a sigh. With his full brown eyes, Rocky looked upon the carved letters of his beloved wife's name with a steady but sad gaze. \"Adrian, I really miss you today… I been thinkin' about what you might be thinkin' about all this…\" He said, referring to the fight that was coming up. Rocky sighed and looked down at the patch of grass beneath the stone, and remembered how much Adrian had opposed him to fighting again after defeating Drago. He wondered if she would oppose this new fight like she did the ones he never fought after the Russian. His thoughts turned away from that one though, cut off by better memories. He remembered how much Adrian had supported him all through out the years, and how she had always been there to help him with his training for all his fights. She was always there helping… always there supporting. She was always there watching and caring… She had seen every one of his fights… She hadn't ever missed a fight… Never… None… Not one. He looked back up at the elegant script of her name, his dark eyes full of emotion. \"I hope you're prouda me, Adrian.\" He breathed in hard, biting his lip trying not to get too emotional…. \"Its been tough ya know… me bein' here and you not bein' here. You made everythin' good. Rocky chuckled sadly. \"You've always made everythin' good. When things were tough with the kid when I screwed up, you did it. Like with the mess with Tommy Gunn, you was there ta help me find the home team again. Ya done it so many times more'n that I can't even count.\" \"And ya did it again Adrian. You made good even with you not here. You fixed our family when I screwed up.\" Rocky was referring to the conversation that happened several weeks ago between him and his son in that very same spot. He and Robert Jr. had lost sight of the home team sometime over the last couple years and had drifted apart. When Robert appeared there in the cemetery, it was a shock, but something about this encounter was strangely different. Rocky and Robert both felt more open and relaxed, more like they were when Adrian was there with them. Rocky had been sitting in his chair by Adrian's grave thinking, and then Robert walked up. It was there that things changed. They had both come to that spot above Adrian's grave, and in moments, they had started talking about stuff they hadn't talked about in years, and more importantly, Robert showed that he would support his father. Rocky Jr. was going to help his namesake in this upcoming fight! There just had to have been some kind of intervention for that to have happened. And it happened right there where Adrian was… \"You helped bring the kid an' me together again.\" -- The boxer's voice changed to a more matter of fact like tone. \"He's been helping me train now you know. Him and Duke. I been training for a fight Adrian.\" Rocky paused for a moment, and studied the mud that recently appeared on his left shoe, letting his last sentence sink in for a short time. He looked back up towards the grave when he thought enough time had passed. \"… Hey, I gotta tell you somethin', and its somethin' that's gotta do with this fight.\" The dark gaze of Rocky's eyes went from the engraved name up to the roses lying atop the stone. He wasn't focused on the petals or buds, but rather on the sharp thorns that stuck out from the stems. \"There's somethin' inside me Adrian… a… a beast. And I need to do this so I can get it out.\" Rocky shook his head. \"It's gotta get out Adrian, The beast is eating me up inside… like a… a cancer an' I can't do it no more.\" He turned his head and forced his voice not to crack though it threatened to. She had died from cancer… Rocky cleared his throat, and his gaze moved back up to the velvet red petals. Imagining that they were his wife's smiling face made him feel better. \"Little Marie told me somethin' that you told me more'n once long ago… She said I'm a fighter and that fighters fight.\" Rocky's gaze returned to his wife's etched name on the headstone. \"I'm a fighter Adrian… I gotta fight this last time. I know you probly don't like it much, but I havta fight. I need to get this beast out.\" Rocky closed his eyes, his head bowed slightly and he murmured. \"I gotta get the beast out.\" … A gentle wind rustled in the tree that usually held the folding chair, and the breeze hit the features of Rocky's battle worn face. A small smile appeared on his lips as he felt a tingle go up his back. His eyes opened as he felt an enormous wave of comfort, love and approval wash over him. \"I'm gonna get that beast out.\" He grinned, knowing precisely what it was that he had felt. \"Thanks Adrian. I love you too.\" He stood and kissed her stone softly. Putting the chair away and walking away from the familiar grave, The Italian Stallion stood tall and held his head up high. Rocky Balboa was now ready to take on the greatest challenge of his life. He was going to prove himself, and he would do it because he had the love and support of both his son and his wife. The determination and confidence of that simple knowledge etched itself onto his face. Rocky was ready to go. He now had the Eye of the Tiger, and the beast was ready to be let out. It may have been a trick of the wind, but as Rocky stepped out of the cemetery, he heard the gravely voice of his old friend and trainer call out from behind him. \" Now go knock his block off, Rock!\" The fighter turned his head slightly as he listened to the words of his mentor echo away through the trees, but he continued walking steadfastly towards his final fight, his face etched with calm determination. \"I will Mick… I will\" The End","LastChapter":"I hope that you all enjoy this little scene that I couldn't get out of my head.

She was always there helping… always there supporting. She was always there watching and caring… She had seen every one of his fights… She hadn't ever missed a fight… Never… None… Not one. He looked back up at the elegant script of her name, his dark eyes full of emotion. \"I hope you're prouda me, Adrian.\" He breathed in hard, biting his lip trying not to get too emotional…. \"Its been tough ya know… me bein' here and you not bein' here. You made everythin' good. Rocky chuckled sadly. \"You've always made everythin' good. When things were tough with the kid when I screwed up, you did it. Like with the mess with Tommy Gunn, you was there ta help me find the home team again. Ya done it so many times more'n that I can't even count.\" \"And ya did it again Adrian. You made good even with you not here. You fixed our family when I screwed up.\" Rocky was referring to the conversation that happened several weeks ago between him and his son in that very same spot. He and Robert Jr. had lost sight of the home team sometime over the last couple years and had drifted apart. When Robert appeared there in the cemetery, it was a shock, but something about this encounter was strangely different. Rocky and Robert both felt more open and relaxed, more like they were when Adrian was there with them. Rocky had been sitting in his chair by Adrian's grave thinking, and then Robert walked up. It was there that things changed. They had both come to that spot above Adrian's grave, and in moments, they had started talking about stuff they hadn't talked about in years, and more importantly, Robert showed that he would support his father. Rocky Jr. was going to help his namesake in this upcoming fight! There just had to have been some kind of intervention for that to have happened. And it happened right there where Adrian was… \"You helped bring the kid an' me together again.\" -- The boxer's voice changed to a more matter of fact like tone. \"He's been helping me train now you know. Him and Duke. I been training for a fight Adrian.\" Rocky paused for a moment, and studied the mud that recently appeared on his left shoe, letting his last sentence sink in for a short time. He looked back up towards the grave when he thought enough time had passed. \"… Hey, I gotta tell you somethin', and its somethin' that's gotta do with this fight.\" The dark gaze of Rocky's eyes went from the engraved name up to the roses lying atop the stone. He wasn't focused on the petals or buds, but rather on the sharp thorns that stuck out from the stems. \"There's somethin' inside me Adrian… a… a beast. And I need to do this so I can get it out.\" Rocky shook his head. \"It's gotta get out Adrian, The beast is eating me up inside… like a… a cancer an' I can't do it no more.\" He turned his head and forced his voice not to crack though it threatened to. She had died from cancer… Rocky cleared his throat, and his gaze moved back up to the velvet red petals. Imagining that they were his wife's smiling face made him feel better. \"Little Marie told me somethin' that you told me more'n once long ago… She said I'm a fighter and that fighters fight.\" Rocky's gaze returned to his wife's etched name on the headstone. \"I'm a fighter Adrian… I gotta fight this last time. I know you probly don't like it much, but I havta fight. I need to get this beast out.\" Rocky closed his eyes, his head bowed slightly and he murmured. \"I gotta get the beast out.\" … A gentle wind rustled in the tree that usually held the folding chair, and the breeze hit the features of Rocky's battle worn face. A small smile appeared on his lips as he felt a tingle go up his back. His eyes opened as he felt an enormous wave of comfort, love and approval wash over him. \"I'm gonna get that beast out.\" He grinned, knowing precisely what it was that he had felt. \"Thanks Adrian. I love you too.\" He stood and kissed her stone softly. Putting the chair away and walking away from the familiar grave, The Italian Stallion stood tall and held his head up high. Rocky Balboa was now ready to take on the greatest challenge of his life. He was going to prove himself, and he would do it because he had the love and support of both his son and his wife. The determination and confidence of that simple knowledge etched itself onto his face. Rocky was ready to go. He now had the Eye of the Tiger, and the beast was ready to be let out. It may have been a trick of the wind, but as Rocky stepped out of the cemetery, he heard the gravely voice of his old friend and trainer call out from behind him. \" Now go knock his block off, Rock!\" The fighter turned his head slightly as he listened to the words of his mentor echo away through the trees, but he continued walking steadfastly towards his final fight, his face etched with calm determination. \"I will Mick… I will\" The End","Summary":" I hope that you all enjoy this little scene that I couldn't get out of my head.

I hope you enjoy! (I took a little bit of poetic license with the timeline as far as when Rocky and Adrian meet since I can' t recall it ever being stated?) Rocky laid awake counting the watermarks on the ceiling. He never noticed them before. Twenty-eight he counted. Where did they come from? The bed must be underneath an upstairs bathtub. Another thing he started to wonder… why was he thinking about the stains on ceiling tiles? Why now? He looked to his side and smiled at the sight. Adrian, snuggled at his side with her arm draped across his chest. She'd never slept this way before. Tonight she fell asleep close to her new husband instead of maintaining a certain distance. Rocky couldn't remember a time he'd been happier. First, he'd gone the distance with Apollo Creed. Now could go on and start a new life with Adrian. Everything was good now. Sure, fighting Creed came with some battle scars. Seeing out of one eye was more of a challenge than he liked to admit to aloud, and some funny colored bruises were still hanging on, but it was worth it. No longer would he be considered a bum. He made a name for himself. Not only did he manage to knock the champ down, he survived all fifteen rounds. Two things no one had ever done with Apollo Creed. From the minute the final bell rang to laying here now on his wedding night, most of his thoughts centered on Adrian. Aside from the first few nights in the hospital, he didn't think about the fight. Other people thought about it as he was reminded wherever he went, but alone, it was all about Adrian. He wanted to give her as much as she'd given him. Not once did he think about how fast their relationship moved. Rocky felt as though Adrian had been with him for half his life as far as the way he cared for her went. They'd known each other a while, sure. She was Paulie's kid sister. Sometimes he wondered why he stayed friends with the guy. His good moments were few and far between. Adrian started working in the pet shop about two years ago. Paulie told him the night before, thrilled to see her getting out of the house 'even for a few hours in the day'. Before then, Rocky never met Adrian – he barely knew her name. For Paulie's sake, he went down to the pet shop on her first day. Besides, he was curious. Paulie spoke so harshly of her, yet, something inside of him couldn't believe it was all true. She must be a nice girl if she's working with animals, right? The pet shop wasn't out of his way, either. It was right across the street from the gym. He'd looked in the window now and then. One room apartments get lonely after a while. Everything added up – he would get a pet and also help Paulie's sister on her first day. Adrian wasn't anything like he expected despite the fact he didn't have a specific image in his mind. He figured she was shorter like Paulie, but that was the only thing he'd assumed right. She wasn't ugly as Paulie would have him believe. He could, however, see why men might not be lined up outside the door to catch a glance. She wore thick glasses almost too big for her face. They seemed outdated, too. Her hair was short and black, which she kept pinned back. Her clothes, like her glasses, also looked outdated. If not outdated, then something an older woman might wear. If not older, a woman her age who was settled with a family and only left the house to run errands. Those things weren't so bad because anyone in their right mind could see how pretty she was underneath. Lastly, she was the quietest person he'd ever met. Paulie said she was shy, but Rocky figured she just didn't like to carry on long conversations. Poor Adrian couldn't look him in the eye. Noticing this right away, he was sure to do all the talking for her. He introduced himself, telling her he knew her brother. It was hard to tell if she knew his name before now. Deciding it didn't matter, he told her what kind of pet he was looking for. Pointing out the different animals was the only time her voice was audible. Even then, the words were mumbled and she kept her head down. She struggled even with this safe topic of conversation. By the end of the visit, Rocky went home with two turtles and a mission. He wanted to see Adrian smile. It goes without saying that Paulie is a hard guy to live with. No wonder the girl didn't say much. He added visits to the pet shop to his daily routine. He stopped by, told a joke or two, chatted with her on days she humored him, and eventually bought a fish to keep the turtles company. Soon enough, it became his favorite part of the day. Paulie didn't ease up on his sister. He continued calling her names and could say nothing good about her. Having met her now, Rocky felt even more drawn to her. He kept his deeper thoughts to himself for the most part. Without a doubt, Paulie would use this attraction against her in some way. Telling Adrian was also difficult, so he didn't – not in specific words. From time to time he'd suggest getting a slice of pizza or walking her home on a rainy day. Each time she shook her head. From any other woman, he would have taken the rejection personally. Two years later and the shy girl from the pet store was lying next to him as his wife. All day the word went through his mind. When he hit twenty-five he figured he wouldn't marry. A family didn't appear to be in the cards. Of course, it would have been nicer if his relationship with Adrian could have evolved without a push from Paulie, but at the same time, he figured maybe nothing ever would have happened otherwise. It's funny how life works out sometimes. Having Adrian in his life made facing Creed easier. She gave him a reason to fight and to keep standing even when his entire body wanted to fall down on the mat and stay there until the pain stopped. She made the aftermath better, too. She came and visited him every day while he recovered. She sat with him in silence while he rested. Something so simple meant everything to him. One of the last afternoons he spent in the hospital after the nurse came and told her visiting hours were over, she stood to say her goodnights. Thinking he was asleep, she bent down to kiss his cheek. She lingered a moment, pressing her nose lightly along his jawline and whispered something he couldn't quite make out. Maybe she just breathed against him. Either way, this was the moment he knew he was going to marry her. No waiting, no games. The minute his head was unbandaged and was given the okay to go home he'd propose. How, he wasn't sure. All he knew was that he couldn't wait. Adrian stirring in her sleep drew Rocky out of his thoughts. He turned his head to look at her, wondering if it would be okay to wake her up. He missed her voice. Until recently, he'd done most of the talking. The disease of being shy must have a cure, Rocky thought. Time, love, and trust. He was proud and thankful to be the one Adrian came to trust. It was all he wanted from the start. Sometimes he felt her slipping back to distrust, or maybe fear could be a disease as well. Earlier tonight she acted this way. She was scared she was going to lose him somewhere down the line. Why would she think about those things? Didn't she know she was the only one he'd ever been able to say he loved? Adrian moved again. This time her eyes fluttered open. Had she not seen Rocky looking down at her with a smile, she would have shut them again. \"Is it morning?\" she asked in a dry voice. \"Nuh, not yet.\" \"How long have you been awake?\" \"I dunno,\" Rocky answered as he turned onto his side. \"I kinda never slept I don't think.\" Adrian yawned. \"Is something the matter?\" \"Yeah.\" He smiled. \"But don't worry. It's all good, you know?\" \"Good.\" Rocky kissed the tip of her nose, waited for a smile, and then kissed her lips. Both of his arms wrapped around her and his head rested atop hers. He was glad when he felt her bury her nose in his neck and her hand tighten around his shoulder. He started drifting off to sleep, at last, but ended up waking himself up when he asked, \"Did I tell you tonight how much I love you?\" \"Mhmm,\" Adrian replied with a similar sleepiness in her voice. \"Good, 'cause I do. Nothin' that happened to me would'a happened if youse hadn't been there. If it did, I don't think I would'a fought so hard or cared none.\" Eyes opened again, she pulled back to reach his cheek. \"I'm proud of you, Rocky. And I love you, too.\" The end.","LastChapter":"Rocky has completely taken over my life as of late, so naturally, I wanted to try my hand at writing for the universe. I hope you enjoy! (I took a little bit of poetic license with the timeline as far as when Rocky and Adrian meet since I can' t recall it ever being stated?) Rocky laid awake counting the watermarks on the ceiling. He never noticed them before. Twenty-eight he counted. Where did they come from? The bed must be underneath an upstairs bathtub. Another thing he started to wonder… why was he thinking about the stains on ceiling tiles? Why now? He looked to his side and smiled at the sight. Adrian, snuggled at his side with her arm draped across his chest. She'd never slept this way before. Tonight she fell asleep close to her new husband instead of maintaining a certain distance. Rocky couldn't remember a time he'd been happier. First, he'd gone the distance with Apollo Creed. Now could go on and start a new life with Adrian. Everything was good now. Sure, fighting Creed came with some battle scars. Seeing out of one eye was more of a challenge than he liked to admit to aloud, and some funny colored bruises were still hanging on, but it was worth it. No longer would he be considered a bum. He made a name for himself. Not only did he manage to knock the champ down, he survived all fifteen rounds. Two things no one had ever done with Apollo Creed. From the minute the final bell rang to laying here now on his wedding night, most of his thoughts centered on Adrian. Aside from the first few nights in the hospital, he didn't think about the fight. Other people thought about it as he was reminded wherever he went, but alone, it was all about Adrian. He wanted to give her as much as she'd given him. Not once did he think about how fast their relationship moved. Rocky felt as though Adrian had been with him for half his life as far as the way he cared for her went. They'd known each other a while, sure. She was Paulie's kid sister. Sometimes he wondered why he stayed friends with the guy. His good moments were few and far between. Adrian started working in the pet shop about two years ago. Paulie told him the night before, thrilled to see her getting out of the house 'even for a few hours in the day'. Before then, Rocky never met Adrian – he barely knew her name. For Paulie's sake, he went down to the pet shop on her first day. Besides, he was curious. Paulie spoke so harshly of her, yet, something inside of him couldn't believe it was all true. She must be a nice girl if she's working with animals, right? The pet shop wasn't out of his way, either. It was right across the street from the gym. He'd looked in the window now and then. One room apartments get lonely after a while. Everything added up – he would get a pet and also help Paulie's sister on her first day. Adrian wasn't anything like he expected despite the fact he didn't have a specific image in his mind. He figured she was shorter like Paulie, but that was the only thing he'd assumed right. She wasn't ugly as Paulie would have him believe. He could, however, see why men might not be lined up outside the door to catch a glance. She wore thick glasses almost too big for her face. They seemed outdated, too. Her hair was short and black, which she kept pinned back. Her clothes, like her glasses, also looked outdated. If not outdated, then something an older woman might wear. If not older, a woman her age who was settled with a family and only left the house to run errands. Those things weren't so bad because anyone in their right mind could see how pretty she was underneath. Lastly, she was the quietest person he'd ever met. Paulie said she was shy, but Rocky figured she just didn't like to carry on long conversations. Poor Adrian couldn't look him in the eye. Noticing this right away, he was sure to do all the talking for her. He introduced himself, telling her he knew her brother. It was hard to tell if she knew his name before now. Deciding it didn't matter, he told her what kind of pet he was looking for. Pointing out the different animals was the only time her voice was audible. Even then, the words were mumbled and she kept her head down. She struggled even with this safe topic of conversation. By the end of the visit, Rocky went home with two turtles and a mission. He wanted to see Adrian smile. It goes without saying that Paulie is a hard guy to live with. No wonder the girl didn't say much. He added visits to the pet shop to his daily routine. He stopped by, told a joke or two, chatted with her on days she humored him, and eventually bought a fish to keep the turtles company. Soon enough, it became his favorite part of the day. Paulie didn't ease up on his sister. He continued calling her names and could say nothing good about her. Having met her now, Rocky felt even more drawn to her. He kept his deeper thoughts to himself for the most part. Without a doubt, Paulie would use this attraction against her in some way. Telling Adrian was also difficult, so he didn't – not in specific words. From time to time he'd suggest getting a slice of pizza or walking her home on a rainy day. Each time she shook her head. From any other woman, he would have taken the rejection personally. Two years later and the shy girl from the pet store was lying next to him as his wife. All day the word went through his mind. When he hit twenty-five he figured he wouldn't marry. A family didn't appear to be in the cards. Of course, it would have been nicer if his relationship with Adrian could have evolved without a push from Paulie, but at the same time, he figured maybe nothing ever would have happened otherwise. It's funny how life works out sometimes. Having Adrian in his life made facing Creed easier. She gave him a reason to fight and to keep standing even when his entire body wanted to fall down on the mat and stay there until the pain stopped. She made the aftermath better, too. She came and visited him every day while he recovered. She sat with him in silence while he rested. Something so simple meant everything to him. One of the last afternoons he spent in the hospital after the nurse came and told her visiting hours were over, she stood to say her goodnights. Thinking he was asleep, she bent down to kiss his cheek. She lingered a moment, pressing her nose lightly along his jawline and whispered something he couldn't quite make out. Maybe she just breathed against him. Either way, this was the moment he knew he was going to marry her. No waiting, no games.

He could see it in the way he moved that he was excited for the fight. It reminded the Italian Stallion of a similar scene so long ago Rocky saw what he was sure that Mickey saw in him so long ago. It didn't matter how many muscles a fighter had. All that mattered was his heart, and if he was willing to take the punches. Rocky remembered the gift Mickey had given him when the old trainer showed just how much faith head had in him, Rocky Maricano cufflink. Rocky fingered the chain he had in his pocket. He had given this necklace to his son a long time ago. But like everything else, his son had left it in Philadelphia. Rocky had found the necklace in a bunch of junk that his kid had thrown away when he moved out of the house. Their relationship had been on rocky ground, Andrian had been dead only a few months at that time. Rocky had never mentioned that he had found it, and his son had never mentioned what became of the necklace. He loved his son to death, and wished that they were closer than they were. But Rocky had come to the painful truth years ago. His son did not need his old man. Not like he used to. The price of living in Rocky's shadow. The kid wanted to strike out and be his own person. For a while Philadelphia had been enough, and he made peace with the fact of who he was after the Dixon fight. But in the end he had went back to believing that Rocky was holding him back. And now Rocky was alone and afraid of getting close to someone, until Adonis. Rocky had tried to push Adonis away. Had to because he was afraid of another person he cared about leaving him. What Mickey said so long ago was true, a person only lost and lost, until a person questioned why they were still living. Finding out he had cancer seemed to be a sign to him, that it was finally time to go on. To be reunited with all his loved ones, Adrian, Polly, Mickey, and Apollo only to name a few. But he had failed to realize that he had something worth living for. Someone who needed him, Adonis was the reason for him to go on. Rocky had almost lost him that night when he said they were not family He had shaken Adonis's faith in him and though they had come back from that. Rocky still felt that he needed to make it somehow to Adonis. He fingered the chain once more and watched as Adonis paused in his warm-up. Rocky new this was his chance. \"Ah come here Adonis, My God you're ready ain't ya?\" \" Ah come here Rock. My God, you're ready ain't ya?\" \"That Pretty won't know what hit him.\" \" That Apollo won't know what hit him.\" \"You're gonna roll over him like a bulldozer, a Creed bulldozer\" \" You're gonna roll over him like a bulldozer, an Italian bulldozer.\" \"Thanks Rocky\" smiled Adonis. Rocky returned it. \"You know kid, I know how you feel about this fight that's comin up. Cause I was young once, too\" You know kid, I know how you feel about this fight that's comin' up. 'Cause I was young once, too. \"And I'll tell you something. Well, if you wasn't here I probably wouldn't be alive today.\" And I'll tell you somethin'. Well, if you wasn't here I probably wouldn't be alive today. It was true, without Adonis, Rocky would have given up. He wouldn't be fighting for his life like he was now if it wasn't for Adonis. Adonis opened his mouth to reply, but Rocky continued before he could say anything. \"That fact that you're here and doing as well as you're doing gives me motivation. To stay alive, 'cause I think that people die sometimes when they don't wanna live no more. Little by little we lose our friends, we lose everything. We keep losin' and losin' till we say you know, 'Oh what the hell am I livin around here for? I got no reason to go on.' That is how I thought when I first found out about this cancer.\" The fact that you're here and doin' as well as you're doin' gives me-what do you call it-motivization? Huh?

We keep losin' and losin' till we say you know, 'Oh what the hell am I livin' around here for? I got no reason to go on.' \"But with you kid, boy, I got a reason to go on. And I'm gonna stay alive and I will watch you make good…and I'll never leave you until that happens. 'Cause when I leave you you'll not only know how to fight, you'll be able to take care of yourself outside the ring too, is that okay?\" But with you kid, boy, I got a reason to go on. And I'm gonna stay alive and I will watch you make good... and I'll never leave you until that happens. 'Cause when I leave you you'll not only know how to fight, you'll be able to take care of yourself outside the ring too, is that okay?\" \"That's okay Old Man\" smiled Adonis softly. Rocky smiled, and drew out the chain he had been fingering. \"I have something for you, a little gift for you that was given to me by my trainer Mickey. It's my favorite thing that I have on this Earth. He told me that Rocky Maricano gave it to him. It's his cufflink, and he told me that it was like an angel on my shoulder. And if I ever got hurt this little angel would whisper in my ear saying, 'Get up you son of a bitch 'cause Mickey loves you'.\" Rocky took off the golden glove that he had worn for most of his life and held it out to Adonis. \"I can't take that Rocky\" \"I want you to have it\" said Rocky, holding it out for Adonis to take. \"I'll tell you the same thing that Mickey told me so long ago. It's gonna be like a, like an angel on your shoulder see? If you ever get hurt and you feel that you're goin' down this little angel is gonna whisper in your ear. It's gonna say...\"Get up you son of a bitch, because Rocky loves you\" said Rocky fondly. \"Wow\" said Adonis, taking the necklace he carefully placed it around his own neck. Rocky smiled as he saw the gratitude that shone in Adonis's eyes he looked back at the old fighter. He had denied that they were family. But in his heart, Rocky truly did feel like Adonis was like a nephew to him. A part of him couldn't help but wonder how the past might have been if Apollo hadn't been killed in the ring. \"Even if I beat this cancer kid, I'm not going to be around forever. This will be a little bit of me that you can carry on, to remember when you an old fighter like me and some kid comes around asking to be trained by the great Adonis Johnston Creed himself. And you will see the same spark that I see in you, the same spark old Mick saw in me. And maybe you can pass this on to that kid. Also maybe it will bring you luck. He gave that to me before my fight with Apollo.\" Adonis didn't know what to say. This necklace was priceless and he couldn't believe that Rocky was giving it to him. He did the only thing he could think of, he wrapped his arms around the old fighter. \"Love you Rocky\" whispered Adonis into Rocky's shoulder as he hugged him close. Rocky glanced up at the ceiling to blink away the tears that appeared in his eyes. \"I love you to Adonis, and I am very proud of you.\" Adonis tightened his arms hugging Rocky closer. \"Thank-you Uncle Rock\" Rocky smiled, and tightened his own hold on the young fighter, \"Anything for my favorite nephew.\" This was a scene that I wished was in the movie, hoped you liked!

You're shaking like a bobble head. Come here.\" He motions him over and he stands in front of him, undoing his tie and made a new knot for for him. \"You're nervous.\" \"Yeah.\" \"It's okay. Every guy panics on days like this.\" He says. \"Were you this scared?\" \"Oh yeah. I was so nervous, I ended up getting drunk at a bar the night before and Paulie had to sober me up before we left for the church.\" \"I feel like I'm gonna throw up.\" \"That's normal too. If it helps, I saw your sister taking shots with Bianca. She had the same scared face you did.\" \"What if that's a sign? If we're both freaking out, then maybe-\" \"Hey hey hey, you two are doing something that's a huge deal. Any person would be nervous. Most people don't survive what you too have gone through. Let me ask you something. Do you love her?\" He asks holding his shoulders. \"Of course I do.\" \"Can you live without her?\" \"I can't.\" \"Do you want to wake up to her every morning?\" \"I do.\" \"Have you done things that would make a woman leave?\" \"Yes.\" \"And why didn't she?\" \"Cause she believed in me and she loved me.\" \"If there was a building on fire and only one of you could get out in time, what would you do?\" \"I'd get her out first.\" \"If you could do it all again, would you change anything?\" \"No.\" \"Now do you want to marry her?\" \"Yes.\" He's surprised at his ease to answer. \"That right there is a man who's ready to marry the love of his life.\" He says as he points to his chest. \"What'd you just do?\" \"Parent psychology. I calmed you down and got the nerves out.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Your welcome.\" He hugs him.\"Now let's go get you married. But before that.\" He pulls out a silver flask and handed it to him. \"Just a chaser. Whiskey and \"Were you expecting me to freak out?\" \"Kind of.\" He 's a knock at the door and they call out to come in. The door opens and it's his sister, Claudia. \"Sorry, Uh Rocky. Somebody is asking for you.\" \"Alright. Are you good here?\" \"Yeah, I'm alright. I'll see you outside.\" \"Alright, hey. You look beautiful.\" He said jokingly. \"Get out of her.\" He laughs and hugs him. Rocky leaves the room with Claudia and walk down the hall. \"Who's asking for me?\" \"Bianca. She's in her room.\" \"Is she okay?\" \"I don't know but she said she wanted to see you before the ceremony starts.\" She points to the door and goes to check on the rest of the arrangements. \"Is it safe to come in?\" Rocky says as he knocks on the door. \"Come in.\" She called out. He walks in the room and found Bianca standing in front of the mirror in her wedding dress, champagne and strapless with mermaid lace. Her hair was half up and down with waves. \"Wow, you look beautiful.\" \"Thank you. I thought white wasn't going to appropriate for me and this color is better on me anyway.\" \"You look beautiful in anything. Claud said you were asking for me.\" \"I was. I need to ask you something. You already know my dad isn't coming to the wedding.\" \"Yeah. I heard about you guys's fight.\" \"He's insanely traditional and me and Donnie aren't exactly traditional. I wanted to ask, if you wanted to, if you could walk me down the aisle?\" \"Really?\" \"You've been a father figure for the both of us and I wouldn't want anyone else to do it.\" \"I'm honored. Absolutely.\" He walks up to her and hugs her, not too tightly so he wouldn't mess up her hair. \"Now I need to ask you something.\" \"What is it?\" \"Have you told him?\" \"How did you know?\" \"I saw you dump your shot in one of the plants.\" \"I found out last night. I'm waiting to tell him after the wedding as a surprise.\" She looks down at her flat stomach and put her hand on it. \"It was a real surprise to me.\" \"He's gonna be happy.\" \"I know but I'm scared.\" \"About what?\" \"That it'll be too much for us. With the boxing and my music, another kid is a challenge and..We love Amara but I don't know if we can go through it again.\" \"Hey, come one sit down.\" He takes her hand and sat down with here on the couch.\"Life doesn't have a timeline. We make plans and God laughs. You two have gotten through so much and get make through whatever comes after that.\" \"How can you be so sure?\" She asks him. \"Because you and Amara are the two things in his life that he cherishes the most and he would any and everything to make you both happy. You two are gonna be fine.\" She starts crying and he grabs a tissue from the table and hands it to her. \"Thank you. God I didn't think I'd be crying this early.\" \"It's your wedding, you get to cry as much as you want.\" They laugh. \"You ready?\" \"Yeah.\" She nods. \"Alright, let's get you two crazy kids married.\" They stand up and Rocky walks to the door while Bianca fixed herself up and grabbed her bouquet of white roses. She takes Rocky's arm and they walked out into the hall. \"Was Don okay when you went to go see him?\" \"I had to help him tie his tie but he's completely fine. He can't wait to see you out there.\" He said calmly as they walked down the main part of the church.","Summary":" Rocky is walking through the back of the church fixing the cufflings on his suit.

I, Adrianna Pennino-or as I am now called Adrian Balboa, am married to Rocky Balboa one of the best man in the world- or Philadelphia. Us, together, standing there in that beautiful church was a dream come true. Well, truthfully I never thought I would get married with a guy like him in mind- or any for that matter- but still it was wonderful. The look he had on his handsome face as he stared into my eyes while the priest talked made my cheeks blush a deep red and my knees a bit wobbly. When we both said our 'I do's' and our lips met for the first time as husband and wife, my heart was nearly pumping itself out of my chest. I'm sure he must've felt the erratic beating of my heart because when we were done he quickly winked his good eye at me and quickly placed his fingers to where my heart was beating before quickly removing them to talk to his trainer, Mickey, and his now ex-boss Gazzo. I was pulled over to the side by my friend and co-worker from the pet shop. She hugged me and kissed my cheek and wiped a small tear away from her cheeks while she chatted with me about the wedding, while Paulie gave me a light slap on the shoulder. \"Oh Adrian, I can't believe your married now. I'm happy that you found someone to settle down with, even if it is with rock-head.\" She gestured her head toward where Rocky was talking with Gazzo. \"I know. I can't believe this happened either. I just….I…\" I put my down to try and conceal the blush I knew was coming on. \"Eh- you know that Rocks a good guy. She'll be alright with him.\" She rolled her eyes at Paulie. \"Does this mean that I'll have to like him then?\" I laughed at her facial expression of disgust. She nodded her head at then smiled a wicked smile. \"Well, are you ready for tonight?\" her left eyebrow rising higher as her smile got wider, her yellow teeth dark from her years of bad smoking habit. \"Tonight? Oh you mean! Oh my…\" if my face wasn't red before it definitely was now. I was so excited about the wedding that I completely forgot about what happens after a wedding. I shuffled my feet and tugged at the sleeves of my wedding dress. I heard Paulie let out a little snort through his nose. \"Okay, now, this is something I don't need to hear about. Adrian, be good and don't let what happened in the past get to ya.\" He patted my back in a brotherly way and said that he would see me later. As he walked out he wished Rocky and I good luck. She scoffed and winked her eye at me. \"Don't worry Adrian; if this guy loves you as much as he claims to then there shouldn't be any problems with tonight. This is will be a good experience for you, trust me.\" Her emphasis on the word 'trust' made my mind wonder. Had he slept with anyone other girl before me? I knew from our small gossip time that she had slept around with many men around the neighborhood before so she would have some experiences. I never actually participated in her conversations, just talked and nodded my head whenever necessary. Sleeping around never appealed to me much and a small, very tiny, part of me wished that I had experienced that before getting married, just so that I wouldn't be unprepared. I didn't even realize that I had blanked out until a very strong and familiar hand grabbed my upper arm. Rocky smiled down at me, helped me into my red coat and took my free hand into his. We both looked over our shoulder as we said our good-byes to everyone and walked out the Chapel doors. We had descended the stone steps when my husband decided to gather me into his arms and carry me bridal style back to his-our home. I was selfishly glad that he had decided to carry me because I knew that tomorrow I would have regretted ever wearing these shoes. Always the gentleman to me. And now here we are, it is a cold December night, and my own knight in shining armor is carrying me away to our very own castle. I wrapped my arms loosely around his neck and put my head on his broad shoulder. He kissed me on the top of my head; I heard his nose inhale in my hair and I looked up, smiling, at him. \"Why'd you do that for?\" \"I just like the smell of your hair ya know? It smells all sweet and flowery.\" I laughed a little and kissed his cheek. He kissed me back on my lips. He continued to walk while I put my head back on his shoulder to rest. I can't believe this. How many countless nights had I spent crying because of my brothers smears and slurs against me? How many times in the morning had I spent looking in the mirror in disappointment at my own reflection? How many days had I wished that my life could change at the snap of my fingers? It's amazing how one man changed my views. Ever since our first 'date' I just couldn't stop thinking about him. He calls me pretty and compliments everything I do. He doesn't just see me as the shy girl who works at the pet shop. No, he sees me as something more. He sees something that not even I can see. The gods have truly blessed me with this man. It was as if he was sent from heaven just for me. We walked by a group of men singing a song by a fire in a garbage can. They sounded pretty good. Rocky stopped to talk to them and they greeted us back. Rocky told them we were married and then they started to sing a love song for us. I blushed and hid my face from him. I was surprised at how he seemed so proud that he had married me. How he boosted about our marriage as though he had won a fight. \"Who are those guys?\" \"Ah, you know, they're like the neighborhood jukebox you know? Hey you know I never you knew you were so light.\" \"Never?\" \"Yeah, if I did I would've carried you around everywhere.\" We both laughed. When we got farther away from the singing group I picked my head up and looked around at my surroundings. I gasped in surprise; we were almost at his house! He had carried me all the way from the church to his house! \"Are you getting tired?\" \"No this is great for the arms. I think.\" \"I can't believe we're married.\" \"Oh we are. I got proof in my pocket.\" My mind raced back to all of our time together. From when we first met, to when we had our first kiss, to when he stayed over for the holidays, when I moved in with him because of Paulie, when I held him that night before the fight with Apollo. \"Everything happened so fast.\" I said. \"Yeah\" he said nonchalantly \"But I knew what was going to happen from the start.\" I was surprised again. \"What did you know?\" \"Well, the first time I sees ya, I says to myself, I says: Even though this girl is suffering from the disease of being shy…underneath all them sweaters and hats and-what did you have on like about twenty sweaters?\" I laughed a little \"No. Three.\" \"Yeah. Three sweaters, she's the best girl in Philly, you know? I said that.\" I was a little bit dazzled. I helped him open the front door and looked back to him, smiling. \"Really?\" \"Oh yeah.\" Rocky quickly got us up the flight of stairs. My heart was beating fast as we got to the door. It was becoming inevitable. As I opened the door Rocky commanded Butkus to get off the bed. Like a good dog he listened. He closed the door behind him with his foot and gently settled me down on my feet. Once I was put down on I knew that tonight, we were definitely going to seal the deal. It was all going to happen tonight and I was nervous and scared. The shy side of me wanted nothing more than to hide in a corner somewhere and hope that he would fall asleep on the couch like he usually did, however, the new side-the side that loved Rocky so much-told me to relax and let what may come. I put away my little white bag in my coat pocket and started to take off my jacket when a pair of strong hands lightly grabbed my shoulders helped me pull off my coat. He put my coat on a chair and faced back towards me and put his hand on my veil. \"Can I take this off?\" he took it off \"That's the way I like you.\" By this time my heart was nearly ready to pump right out of my chest. I was breathing heavily and my cheeks were definitely red hot. He caressed my head and cheeks. \"You know you're the best thing to ever come into my crazy life. You know that, huh?\" he brought both my hands in his and lightly kissed my knuckles. This man was just too much for me. \" Gods, if this is a dream then please don't wake me up .\" I thought in my head. He picked me up in his arms again and put me on our bed. He sat down next to me and stared down at me. I breathed in and out to calm my nerves; I had a question in my mind, had to ask him. \"You think it'll always be like this?\" I almost whispered. \"Yeah.\" My heart rate slowed down but still beat fast from the nerves. As he stared into my eyes, and I to his, I felt a connection. It was as though he was reaching deep into me, breaking all my barriers, and comforting me. A sudden flash back hit me like a lightning bolt. My mother and father; both seemed like they were happily in love, I never remembered one time that they fought or argued, in front of me and Paulie anyway. But, one day, I found my mother crying on the kitchen floor. Her head was in her hands and her face was a deep color red. Innocently I had asked her what was wrong, she didn't reply to me at first only held me in her arms as tightly as she could. Eventually she had told me and Paulie that our father had left us, she also told us how we should all stick together because in the end family was important. Mom died a few years later, leaving me and Paulie in the hands of our callous uncle. He was hardly ever home and when he was he would sit and drink all day. So I had to be the one to take care of the cooking and the cleaning, playing the motherly role. Rocky was still looking at me so I took the opportunity to ask him the question. \"I hope you...\" I stopped, Paulies words were still echoing in my mind. \"What?\" he urged me to continue. \"I hope you never get tired of me.\" \"Oh no\" he shook his head softly \"You ain't ever gettin' rid of me.\" \"I hope nothing changes.\" \"I ain't changing and I sure ain't changing nothing about you.\" I didn't want to ruin our moment by looking away but I needed him. Something deep in me wanted to hold him and kiss him. Make love to him and hold him all night. Was this what every woman felt the night they get married? I knew Rocky was sort of like me in some ways. We were both alone for much too long. Both searching for someone to fill in our gaps. He was the one I wanted. This man, Rocky. I wanted to be the one to take care of him and hold him when he was feeling down. I wanted to be the one he greeted in the mornings and kissed goodnight too. I wanted to raise a family and grow old with him. Yet I felt as though I wasn't good enough for him. What could I offer to him? He had dreams. He could go the distance, he's proved it once. What could I offer? With a chance I said the magic words: \"I love you.\" And he responded. \"I love you too.\" I closed my eyes to savor the feel of his lips on mine. This kiss was different. It wasn't like our first kiss or any other that we had before. His lips were gentle and yet firm. He gently placed his lips on mine, picked his head up and placed them back down. He repeated this action for a while before finally fully kissing me. This kiss. It was better than our first. His tongue slowly danced around with mine. He slowly out his tongue in my mouth and explored. My fingers itched to run through his messy curls. With my hand caught between our bodies, I tried to get it out. Rocky made it easier by just picking his body up. I don't know how we got to this position but the next thing I knew my head was near the edge of the bed and his arm was underneath my head supporting it, never once breaking our kiss. I started to feel a bit dizzy from our kiss and broke away from it breathing heavily. Rocky just stared at me and kissed me cheek. \"You're beautiful, you know that?\" he kissed the sensitive spot on my neck causing my body to shudder. I felt hot. My hands roamed up and down his back, feeling the hard muscles' underneath his suit. I felt ready to give myself to the man I love. That night when made love it was everything I had hoped and dreamed for. When he took my virginity away it hurt a lot, I hadn't expected that. I cried a bit but Rocky soothed me with his soft words and kissed away my tears. I gasped as he entered my body, he was big inside me, stretching me wide. However it felt good. Was this what my friend was talking about all this time? I just laid back while Rocky rocked our bodies in a soft rhythm. With my legs wrapped around him he kept hitting something very deep within me that caused me to shout and moan when he hit it. There was a tight knot forming in the pit of my stomach, my back arched and I felt my body stiffen. Before my mind could make sense of what was happening I felt as though something huge had erupted in me. Rocky, holding his weight on his arms, was panting heavily above me. He ran my hand though his sweat soaked hair and kissed him. He moved our bodies together so we were both lying on our sides. I traced his jaw, eyes, lips and face. Now as I lay here looking at him, I prayed that all this wasn't a dream. Rocky had gone the distance when he fought Apollo. Well, I've gone my own distance, I've got the man I love and can't nothing break my happiness now. I laid my head next to his chest and closed my eyes. Happily and in peace. Authors Footnote: OKay not too bad I hope. It's just something that was in my head for a while. A little POV for Adrian. I wanted to include a sex scene but I just didn't feel like this story needed one. However; in the next story I am writing ( Rocky and Adrianna: The Honeymoon) there will be some explicit sex scenes. So please umm....some light reveiws and hoped you enjoyed- somewhat-. Thanks!","LastChapter":"Rocky and Adriana wedding night Adrian POV I cannot believe that today has happened.

Was this what my friend was talking about all this time? I just laid back while Rocky rocked our bodies in a soft rhythm. With my legs wrapped around him he kept hitting something very deep within me that caused me to shout and moan when he hit it. There was a tight knot forming in the pit of my stomach, my back arched and I felt my body stiffen. Before my mind could make sense of what was happening I felt as though something huge had erupted in me. Rocky, holding his weight on his arms, was panting heavily above me. He ran my hand though his sweat soaked hair and kissed him. He moved our bodies together so we were both lying on our sides. I traced his jaw, eyes, lips and face. Now as I lay here looking at him, I prayed that all this wasn't a dream. Rocky had gone the distance when he fought Apollo. Well, I've gone my own distance, I've got the man I love and can't nothing break my happiness now. I laid my head next to his chest and closed my eyes. Happily and in peace. Authors Footnote: OKay not too bad I hope. It's just something that was in my head for a while. A little POV for Adrian. I wanted to include a sex scene but I just didn't feel like this story needed one. However; in the next story I am writing ( Rocky and Adrianna: The Honeymoon) there will be some explicit sex scenes. So please umm....some light reveiws and hoped you enjoyed- somewhat-. Thanks!","Summary":" Rocky and Adriana wedding night Adrian POV I cannot believe that today has happened.

It was dark outside, almost nine or ten or so, and Adrian was just beginning to close down the shop for the night. Gloria had already gone home a few hours before and nobody had bothered to visit in those hours, so Adrian decided to shut it down for the night. But that was before Rocky came. She looked down as he entered the shop and gently closed the door behind him. She put the lizard back in it's tank with the other reptiles and then quickly moved behind the counter when she saw Rocky start to approach her. \"We're closing,\" she said softly, avoiding his gaze. He fumbled with the bouncy ball he always had with him and nodded his head, as if agreeing with her. \"Yeah, I know, but I, uh, I just came by to, uh, you know, tell you something. I don't know, maybe you'll like it, maybe not, we'll see.\" Adrian mentally sighed. It wasn't that she didn't enjoy Rocky's constant visits to the pet shop, but that he always tried to tell her a joke. She didn't know why he always did it—at first she found it a bit odd and tried to avoid him every chance she got—but now it was kind of growing on her, so she allowed him to continue with it. \"So, uh, here I go. Why was six afraid of seven?\" Adrian slightly shrugged and kept her head down, but she answered softly, \"I don't know.\" \"Cause seven was a well known six offender,\" he said, pausing to glance up at her to see her reaction. He wasn't surprised to see that she wasn't smiling or showing any positive reaction, but he was a little surprised to see that she had shrunk back a little and took a step back. Rocky shrugged and kind of grimaced, as if he was the one hearing the joke and not Adrian. \"Too much? Yeah, I'm sorry. Should've known it wouldn't be good. I kind of made that up on the stop, though, what do you think?\" Adrian took a second to look at him, but then quickly looked away and she heard Rocky sigh. \"Yeah, listen, I'm sorry. That wasn't a very good one.\" He then looked at her and kind of held up his hands in defense. \"I mean, I'm not saying I'm a six offender, or anything…or, sex offender, what do you call it? I mean, I'm not saying that either, but you know…I…\" Defeated, he kind of trailed off in mid sentence and looked away, hanging his head in embarrassment. Adrian chuckled at his awkward stammering in a kind way. \"I know, Rocky,\" she said quietly and he looked back at her. The tiniest smile had spread across her lips and Rocky couldn't help but to smile back. That smile was what he was looking for the entire time. It was the highlight of his day, seeing that smile on her face. When Gazzo's bodyguard was giving him lip, or Mickey or the other boxers were putting him down, he would always count on seeing that smile on Adrian's face, and suddenly every bad thing that happened earlier disappeared. That smile erased all the darkness in his day and replaced it with nothing but light. \"You got a nice smile, you know that?\" he said and he saw her lightly shake her head no. \"Well, you do. Thing is, I don't see it very often, so that's why I think it's special.\" Adrian kind of looked down for a moment and shook her head, more to herself, in doubt and in deep thought. The smile, still frozen on her lips, was slowly beginning to fade. She brushed a stray strand of hair away from her face and tucked it behind her ear. \"What's to smile about?\" she asked truthfully. Rocky's smile widened and he began making motions with his hands to explain. \"There's plenty to smile about. Now, I know you might not be having the best day, but the little things make it worthwhile, doesn't it? Take me for example, I lost a fight against a guy named Dipper last night, the power in my apartment went out last night, and today some of the idiots at the gym decided to raid my locker. How about that?\" \"I'm sorry,\" Adrian apologized softly. \"Nah, ain't your fault. Listen, it gets better. All that stuff that happened today?\" He waved his hand, brushing away the past. \"Gone. Cause now I'm standing in front of an attractive girl with the best smile in all of Philly, and that's why I'm smiling. What makes you smile?\" Adrian took a moment to absorb what he was saying. What was the highlight of her day? What made everything suddenly seem better and what made the darkest days suddenly become filled with light? What made her smile? She looked up at Rocky, but instead of looking away, she continued to look. He held her gaze and continued to smile, and her smile only grew from there, because she had finally found the reason behind her smile.

Jordan. He's a great actor and he did awesome as Apollo Creed's son, Adonis aka Donnie. When I saw the scene where his character Killmonger saw his father in Black Panther, I wondered what it'd be like if Donnie saw his father in Creed. Well, this is how I saw it. I hope you enjoy it. Adonis Creed, aka Donnie fell with a thud. His opponent, Ricky Conlan had just knocked him out cold, and now, he was in a dark room. Suddenly, a light came on and filled the room. Now, he could see glazed hardwood floors, a training ring, punching bags. He was in a boxing gym. Looking over to another wall, a banner hung that said 'MIGHTY MICK'S BOXING'. He was shocked at the sight of the place. It looked different. It looked old. Not as much space. Old punching bags, boarded floor with a few crack in them. 'Must've been before dey remodeled da place,' Donnie said to himself. \"You really did it,\" a voice said. Donnie turned towards one of the rings to see a man standing in the middle of it. His eyes widened at the sight of him. He couldn't believe it, but the man standing there was none other than Apollo Creed. \"Apollo?\" Donnie said as he slowly walked towards the ring. \"That's right, son. Looks like you've been havin' fun with the Stallion, huh?\" Apollo laughed as he noticed the marks on his son's face. \"Aw yeah, just um... Just tryina' make it the best I can.\" \"You're doing pretty good at that.\" \"I don't think so.\" Donnie said as he hung his head low. \"What makes you say that?\" Apollo asked. \"I'm worried.\" \"Worried bout what, son?\" Donnie hung his head once again. This wasn't something easy to do. To some, he was already viewed as nothing but a mistake. And he didn't want that to ruin his father's legacy even more. Donnie took a few breaths before confessing his fear. \"I'm afraid of losing and puttin' shame on ya' name.\" Apollo nodded in understanding. The times were different and rougher than they were when he was growing up. So it was easy to see how Donnie felt. \"Trust me, Adonis. Even if you do win this fight, you'll have brought more honor to my name than I ever could've done.\" \"What do ya' mean?\" \"Well for one thing, you've fought to get here. Both literally and figuratively.\" The father and son laughed at that. It felt good to be able to do this with his father, even though he was dead. \"But my point is, not everyone will look at the outside appearance of you. As some result of a mistake I made. Cause that's how some will see it. But others who're smarter will look at the inside and see exactly what me and Rocky have. And that's the heart of a warrior. The fire that powers you. The Creed spirit. And you sure as hell got it.\" This made Donnie think. He had more than his father's good looks. He'd been fighting, literally fighting his whole life for this. And he made it. And it was all thanks to Rocky, Apollo, Bianca, and of course, his mom. And he was glad to have them in his corner. Wiping away a few tears before looking back at his father. \"Thanks Pop.\" He said. \"Nah, its my pleasure, Donnie.\" Apollo replied as he hugged his son hard and Donnie didn't waste any time returning the hug. \"I love ya', son.\" \"...I love you too, Pops.\" \"I'm prouda ya too. Keep listenin' to the Stallion, he knows what he's talkin' about.\" Donnie nodded against father as they broke the hug with smiles. \"Now you gotta get back up there and finish this,\" Apollo said patting his son's shoulder. \"How?\" Donnie asked confusingly. Apollo chuckled as he held up his fist, signaling he had to be sent back the same way he got here. \"Eh, figures,\" Donnie said as he readied his jaw. \"Oh, and by the way, you look good in those shorts.\" Apollo laughed. Donnie scrunched his eyebrows in confusion. \"What?\" Before he could say anything thing else, he felt the fist connect to his face, sending him flying through the darkness and back towards the light of consciousness. Donnie gasped as he awoke. That punch his father gave him had felt so real, but it sure woke him up. It gave him an adrenaline rush to get up quickly as if he hadn't been knocked down at all. And he was ready once again. Ready to fight. ***After The Fight*** \"Adonis, I know you never met your father. But if he was here tonight, what would you wanna say to him?\" A reporter asked. Little did he know, that in a way, Donnie had met his father. 'If only they knew,' He said to himself. \"I'll just tell him I love him.\" He replied, \"And I know he didn't leave me on purpose. And I'm proud to be a Creed.\" \"Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations on a sensational performance.\" The crowd was going wild over Donnie victory. \"Creed! Creed! Creed!\" \"Go on, talk to them,\" Rocky said holding up his arm with a proud smile, \"Go on!\" Using whatever strength he had left, he raised his other arm in victory and pride. Know good and well that he'd earned the name, Creed. ***Rocky Steps*** As Rocky and Donnie looked out on Philly from top of the stairs, a feeling of relief passed over Donnie. A feeling of love from his surrogate father, Rocky Balboa. \"'Ey, thanks Unc,\" He said with a grin. \"For what?\" Rocky said, finally getting his breath back after climbing all those steps. \"For making all this possible. If Pops hadn't chosen you, you never would've met 'im. And I might've never met Mom, or Bianca, or you. You made all this possible. Thanks for bein' there for me.\" Those words made Rocky's heart soar. He may have already had a son, and he loved him dearly. But if he'd had another son, he'd be proud for it to be Donnie. And he knew Apollo would feel the same. \"It's alright, son,\" the Italian Stallion replied, \"Now whadaya day we go get some food? You're gonna need to bulk up with some nice meat, and I know a great place that has the best Philly Cheesesteak ever.\" \"Aight, I'm in!\" Donnie replied as he walked back to the van. \"Hey wait! Don't get in!\" Rocky paced himself as he slowly walked back down towards the van. \"Why not?\" \"I drive, you run alongside.\" \"C'mon, Unc. Really?\" \"Yeah, you're still in training. You think Conlan was fast, who knows how fast your next opponent's gonna be.\" As Rocky got into the driver seat, Donnie sighed heavily as he loosened himself up to get ready, remembering he didn't get a chance to last time. \"Aight, how far is this place?\" He asked through the open window. Rocky turned on the car with a smirk, \"Not too far,\" he laughed as he sped off. \"Ey no fair!\" Swiftly, Donnie took off to catch up. After a block or so, he was finally alongside the van, trying to keep up with Rocky. \"That was your next lesson, the element of surprise!\" The Italian Stallion laughed as he drove on. Donnie smiled as he ran, knowing that things were gonna get better and crazier as he and Rocky kept working together. So what do ya think, emotional enough? I always liked scenes in movies where the father is passing the torch to their kid. And I just had to do this. So I hope you guys enjoyed it. Plus, it's just in time for Creed 2. Should I make a sequel one shot where Donnie and Robert Balboa(Rocky's son) meet? Make like a family dinner type of deal? Lemme know, and I'll do it. Later guys!

Jimmy Cooper saw the jab from Rick coming a mile away. \"So fucking predictable.\" He sneered moving his hide just far back enough for the punch to miss him and Jimmy knew he had it. His left arm came out like a missile, nearly shattering Rick's jaw. Jimmy stood back and watched the sneer still on his lips as Rick crashed to the ground. \"Come on you piece of shit! I came here to spar not fucking make out!\" As he said this Rick's trainer ran into the ring and looked up at Jimmy and glared, \"What's your fucking problem Jimmy? It's a spar for Christ's sake!\" Jimmy shrugged, \"It's not my fault your boy can't fight to save his life. Get him out of my ring.\" \"Aint your ring kid.\" Jimmy's eyes widened and he bolted around to see an old man who had been watching most of the fight. \"Say that to my dad old man he owns this piece of shit gym.\" Snapped Jimmy the sneer returning to his lips the old man gave no reply and walked back to the other ring to watch another fight. Jimmy watched the old man walking away with a small amount of disbelief then slumped against the ropes in the corner turning to his friend Mark. \"Who the hell was that guy?\" \"That was the guy your dad bought the gym from. I don't know who he is but from what I heard his wife died awhile back and he had to sell his gym to cover the expenses. I guess your dad let him stick around as a trainer.\" \"That's my dad,\" grinned Jimmy. \"I've never noticed him in here before though.\" \"That's because your too busy beating this hit out of every lamer who steps foot in this gym,\" replied Mark. \"That old guy is awfully familiar though.\" Jimmy nodded then leaned turned around so that he could see the other ring, \"Hey old man! How about coming over here and giving me some expert advice.\" The old man turned and stared at Jimmy for a moment then jumped off the ring apron and walked over to the other ring slowly climbing into it so that he was right next to Jimmy. Jimmy looked back at his friend and gave him a \"watch this\" look then turned back to the old man. \"So how bout it? Got any pearls of wisdom for me?\" The old man shook his head; \"I don't give out advice to overconfident rich punks.\" Once again the arrogant sneer left Jimmy's face and he turned serious, \"What did you say old man?\" \"You hear me,\" he replied. So what? I'm not good enough? Have you ever even boxed before old man?\" \"A couple times.\" \"How about you and me spar a little?\" he noticed the horrified look on his friends face and ignored it. He waited for the old man to reply and grew more annoyed when he did not give an immediate reply. \"Come on old man! Teach me a couple things.\" \"Hey Jimmy baby\" Jimmy turned around to see his girlfriend Nancy standing next to the ring.\" \"Nancy, I thought I was gonna pick you up later,\" Jimmy had momentarily forgotten the old man and was now thinking about how good he was gonna feel a little later that night. \"I know, But I had some extra time so I thought I'd come down and watch you fight.\" She brushed back her long blond hair. \"Kill anyone?\" \"No not yet,\" he smiled turning back to the old man whose demeanor and facial expression had not changed at all. \"This old man was just about to have a little spar with me and give me a few pointers right old man?\" \"If you think you can win.\" \"Ohhhh, a little confident are we? Well go get yourself a glove but don't bother changing into some trunks. I don't want my poor girlfriend to be scarred by some olds guys beer gut. Besides, I have a feeling it's gonna be a short fight.\" \"So do I.\" Mark looked across the ring at the old man still trying to think of where he had seen him before. He shook his head and turned back to Jimmy who he figured, never looked more confident in his entire life. \"Look Jimmy man do we really need to do this? He's gotta be like sixty years old..\" Jimmy shook his head, \"Don't be such a chicken shit. I know how old this guy is. Don't worry I'll tap him a little and he'll go down and head back to the senior citizens home. End of fucking story.\" \"I dunno man He's not even wearing gloves.\" \"So?

You got a big exhibition match next weekend and he's supposed to be pretty tough.\" \"Sid Euedy right?\" \"Yeah,\" \"He'll be easier to knock out then the old guy!\" He looked down at Nancy. \"Let me just mop up here and then I'll change and we can go out.\" \"Okay baby hurry though.\" \"Are we gonna fight today or would you and your girl like a few more minutes?\" Jimmy raised an eyebrow as he turned and looked at the old man who taken his hat off and had taken off his faded leather jacket. Jimmy was mildly surprised at how well built the old man was for someone who looked more aged then his father. \"A little excited to get started huh? Well medication can always give a little adrenaline shot.\" He smacked his gloves together and jumped back and forth then walked to the center of the ring where the old man had been standing the whole time. \"Hey Jimmy! Put on your helmet man!\" Jimmy turned around and shook his head, \"I'm not gonna need it.\" He turned back to the old man \"Well let's get this over with. As you can see I'm gonna be a busy guy later on.\" The old man gave no reply and stood back slightly raising his fists. Jimmy could hardly contain himself. \"Shouldn't need to do too much.\" He thought he threw a few light jabs a couple inches away from the old man then danced back and forth. Then out of nowhere jabbed the right side of the old mans head causing him to step back a little but otherwise retain his posture. Jimmy threw another punch but this time the old man blocked it. Growing more surprised by the minute; Jimmy threw three more similar punches all of which the old man blocked. \"Fuck this piece of shit,\" growled Jimmy to himself deciding to throw one good roundhouse and give the old man a broken nose and the knowledge not to fuck with the younger generation. He sneered again and wound back and had the punch aimed dead on. In one swift moiton the old man stepped back and ducked slightly coming back up with an uppercut so hard it knocked Jimmy a good three feet in the air before crashing to the ground. Jesus Christ! You knocked him out!\" exclaimed Mark climbing into the ring to check on Jimmy. \"That was some fucking punch man! The only guy I knew who could uppercut like that was this guy my dad took to watch when I was a kid Rocky Balbo-\" He stopped as a realization came over him, \"Holy shit! Y-Your-\" \"Just an old man,\" replied Rocky smiling slightly as he put on his jacket and climbed out of the ring walking to the entrance. \"Couldn't resist could ya pop?\" Rocky smiled as he pushed the door open and walked out into the cold night air,\" Nope.\" \"Well you taught that guy a lesson I couldn't stand that fucking prick. Karen was getting worried about ya and so was Joey.\" \"Sorry about that son,\" apologized Rocky coughing as he walked down the street with his son. \"I still can't believe the way you played out Jimmy knowing the whole time you could knock him out.\" \"Yeah, Adrian would have gotten a kick out of that.\" Rocky coughed again and threw an arm around Rocky jr. as they turned a corner in the cold streets of Philadelphia. End. I'm not a huge Rocky fan though I did like all the movies (Except part four.

Jimmy Cooper saw the jab from Rick coming a mile away. \"So fucking predictable.\" He sneered moving his hide just far back enough for the punch to miss him and Jimmy knew he had it. His left arm came out like a missile, nearly shattering Rick's jaw. Jimmy stood back and watched the sneer still on his lips as Rick crashed to the ground. \"Come on you piece of shit! I came here to spar not fucking make out!\" As he said this Rick's trainer ran into the ring and looked up at Jimmy and glared, \"What's your fucking problem Jimmy? It's a spar for Christ's sake!\" Jimmy shrugged, \"It's not my fault your boy can't fight to save his life. Get him out of my ring.\" \"Aint your ring kid.\" Jimmy's eyes widened and he bolted around to see an old man who had been watching most of the fight. \"Say that to my dad old man he owns this piece of shit gym.\" Snapped Jimmy the sneer returning to his lips the old man gave no reply and walked back to the other ring to watch another fight. Jimmy watched the old man walking away with a small amount of disbelief then slumped against the ropes in the corner turning to his friend Mark. \"Who the hell was that guy?\" \"That was the guy your dad bought the gym from. I don't know who he is but from what I heard his wife died awhile back and he had to sell his gym to cover the expenses. I guess your dad let him stick around as a trainer.\" \"That's my dad,\" grinned Jimmy. \"I've never noticed him in here before though.\" \"That's because your too busy beating this hit out of every lamer who steps foot in this gym,\" replied Mark. \"That old guy is awfully familiar though.\" Jimmy nodded then leaned turned around so that he could see the other ring, \"Hey old man! How about coming over here and giving me some expert advice.\" The old man turned and stared at Jimmy for a moment then jumped off the ring apron and walked over to the other ring slowly climbing into it so that he was right next to Jimmy. Jimmy looked back at his friend and gave him a \"watch this\" look then turned back to the old man. \"So how bout it? Got any pearls of wisdom for me?\" The old man shook his head; \"I don't give out advice to overconfident rich punks.\" Once again the arrogant sneer left Jimmy's face and he turned serious, \"What did you say old man?\" \"You hear me,\" he replied. So what? I'm not good enough? Have you ever even boxed before old man?\" \"A couple times.\" \"How about you and me spar a little?\" he noticed the horrified look on his friends face and ignored it. He waited for the old man to reply and grew more annoyed when he did not give an immediate reply. \"Come on old man! Teach me a couple things.\" \"Hey Jimmy baby\" Jimmy turned around to see his girlfriend Nancy standing next to the ring.\" \"Nancy, I thought I was gonna pick you up later,\" Jimmy had momentarily forgotten the old man and was now thinking about how good he was gonna feel a little later that night. \"I know, But I had some extra time so I thought I'd come down and watch you fight.\" She brushed back her long blond hair. \"Kill anyone?\" \"No not yet,\" he smiled turning back to the old man whose demeanor and facial expression had not changed at all. \"This old man was just about to have a little spar with me and give me a few pointers right old man?\" \"If you think you can win.\" \"Ohhhh, a little confident are we? Well go get yourself a glove but don't bother changing into some trunks. I don't want my poor girlfriend to be scarred by some olds guys beer gut. Besides, I have a feeling it's gonna be a short fight.\" \"So do I.\" Mark looked across the ring at the old man still trying to think of where he had seen him before. He shook his head and turned back to Jimmy who he figured, never looked more confident in his entire life. \"Look Jimmy man do we really need to do this? He's gotta be like sixty years old..\" Jimmy shook his head, \"Don't be such a chicken shit. I know how old this guy is. Don't worry I'll tap him a little and he'll go down and head back to the senior citizens home. End of fucking story.\" \"I dunno man He's not even wearing gloves.\" \"So?

Pure darkness consumes all. Wait! A glimmer of silver has appeared. The whole world watches, as there is nothing else to see, as the silver object floats up. A boxing glove. A lone silver boxing glove, with so much power within it that no one wishes to feel its wrath. \"ARRRGH!!\" \"Again! Again!\" Suddenly, the rival to this glove appears. Another silver glove floats in the empty darkness. The glove has as much power as the other. The first glove begins to rotate and reveal itself, showing it's red and white stripes alongside it's white stars engulfed in blue proudly. The other glove shows it colors proudly too. A red background with a yellow symbol, that of a star, a hammer and a sickle. This symbol became weak in the 90s but has come back, and it's powerful. \"He's getting killed out there!\" \"No he's not getting killed, he's getting him mad!\" The two gloves charge toward one another. The hatred they hold for each other is beyond comprehension. The two fists meet and as they impact an explosion of fury erupts. Risin up,back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet Just a man and his will to survive \"Come on! Whole world's watching, knock me out! Come on, knock me out!\" yelled Rocky. Clubber hit Rocky hard in the back. Rocky smugly said \"Hit me harder! Come on!\" Clubber responded by giving him another blow to the side of Rocky's gut. Apollo's trainer cried out to Rocky screaming \"Noooo!\" Clubber unleashed a hard left to Rocky's defensive arms. His white mouthpiece was a combo of disgusting red and yellow. His mouth opened wide before the next hit, which was a right to Rocky's guarding arms. He managed to get Rocky in the back of the head. Rocky was now moving away from Clubber, even as another punch was hit on the back of his head. So many times, it happens too fast You trade your passion for glory Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past You must fight just to keep them alive \"Come on champ! Ain't so bad! Ain't so bad! Ain't nothin'!\" yelled Rocky as he tried to move his injured mouth, which was difficult with blood dripping into his mouth. Rocky was backed into a corner. Clubber's blows kept missing. Rocky had planned this and began attacking Clubber and moving out of the corner. Then with one huge blow, Rocky punched Clubber Lang in the head, and the behemoth fell to the ground. It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight Risin' up to the challenge of our rival And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night Clubber Lang got on his hands and knees and began shaking his head to regain some focus. He did around the first second he was on the ground. He looked up into Rocky's eyes and saw something that wasn't there before. \"Stay down…\" cried Taarin. Those eyes…they once were his. Rocky had Clubber's eyes. Clubber never had blue eyes, but the look…Clubber had looked for it in the mirror everyday and could not find it. He now knew what that look was. He lost the Eye of the Tiger. He knew he had no chance of winning the fight. In shock, he stayed there for the full ten seconds. Rocky Pinnicle regained his title. He jumped up in the air with joy and the ring was flooded with his friends. And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger… Rocky IV Starring Rocky Pinnicle \"Come on, we made a deal!\" said Apollo as they entered the dark gym and walked towards the ring. Apollo was wearing red shorts while Rocky was wearing yellow. \"I know, but this is extremely crazy.\" Apollo Creed \"I know, it's mentally irregular. But it makes all the sense in the world. You owe me a favor.\" John Mazz \"I know, but when did you think of this?\" \"About three years ago. Last time you beat by one second, one second. That's hard for someone of my intelligence to handle.\" \"I thought you said that after I beat you, you learned to live with it.\" Ivan Drago \"I lied.\" Said Apollo jocundly as they entered the ring. \"So this is just to prove it to yourself, huh? \"That's right. No T.V.s, no camera crews, no crowd. Just you, me and the ring.\" And Bob as Bob \"You sure you want to do this? You taught me all you know.\" \"Almost everything. You fight great but I am a great fighter.\" Said Apollo as he put his mouthpiece in. \"You wanna ring the bell?\" Rocky asked. \"Sure. Ding, Ding.\" Said Apollo as he moved his left arm in the air jokingly. \"Wow, looking smooth.\" \"I taught you well, Mountain.\" \"I might aim for the wrong guy.\" And then the two threw a punch at the other's head at the exact same moment. That fight, which not even I know the outcome of, was one of Pinnicle's greatest bouts… \"Rocky IV\" written by Sylvester Stallone Neptune Circle created by Rocky Pinnicle and John Mazz Fanfiction written by BearFrog The television suddenly blinks on. A yellow city appears on the t.v. with jazzy music in the background. \"From NBC Studios in New York… Late Night with Conan O' Brien! Tonight, from the hit t-v show 'Cooking with James'…Migos Username! Also tonight, the author of many great horror stories… Bovine Sith! Last but not least, Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world and one of the best flash artists ever…Rocky Pinnicle! Musical Guest Papa Roach!\" Suddenly the scene shifts to inside the room where the magic takes place. \"With Max Weinberg and the Max Weinberg Seven! And here he is…your O' Brien!\" yelled the announcer as the screen moved to the area where Conan does his monologue each night. He did his usual strange dance, with the licking of his hair and the music intensifying and finishing off with a big jump, which ended the music. A little bit of drumming was done as Conan moved around a bit but that's all the music that was given. The applause was gigantic, since Pinnicle had a huge fanbase. \"Wow. Let me tell you folks right now that you are in for a great show. Lots to talk about, let's start off with some world news. Recently the Soviet Union has reformed, I'm sure you've all heard about this. All the former Soviet Republics have been keeping real quiet for months and then suddenly told the world society that the U.S.S.R. is back. \" The crowd was pretty quiet about Conan's statement. They all had heard about it. The Cold War was back on. \"Yeah, pretty amazing isn't it? The first thing they said after they declared the reformation was 'You can keep the girls we sent you.' \" The crowd gave a faint giggle. \"Hey, you've got the easy job! I've got to say these jokes!\" screamed Conan. \"But seriously, we have a great show tonight. I say that every night because I have to, but tonight we really have a great show. We have Migo from the show Cooking with James.\" Conan said and the crowd cheered madly. \"Good show, good show. Also tonight we have someone who is very interesting. If any of you can read you might know about his great books. We will be having Bovine Sith on our show tonight!\" Conan told the crowd. Once the wave of cheers faded he started talking again. \"Also tonight we have the heavyweight champion making his first press appearance after his victory of Clubber Lang three weeks ago…Rocky Pinnicle!\" The crowd let out it's biggest cheer yet. \"And finally we'll have musical guest Papa Roach! And here's Max Weinberg and the Max Weinberg Seven!\" yelled Conan as he pointed to Max and his band who began playing as Conan went to his seat. \"Now as you all know, unless you're like that chick from 50 First Dates and have crappy memory, the Soviet Union has reformed itself. It even has China under its rule. The only former Soviet republic not a part of the new U.S.S.R. is Germany. Now here is one question I have to ask: How did we miss that? How can you not notice the biggest Communist Empire in the world rebuilding itself? This isn't the kind of thing that just sneaks up on you. But on a positive note, at least it's just the Soviet Union. It's not like the Roman Empire. This country has never done anything wrong and to prove it we're going to show you a special tribute to this great country. Let's take a look.\" A video plays, playing happy music as it shows clips of all the terrible things the Soviets did to its people, like slave labor and no rights and concentration camps. It also shows all the horrible things the Soviet countries have done. After watching the video, Conan was seen laughing and said \"We are going to get so many angry letters tonight.\" Conan said, laughing. The crowd laughed at this too. \"Our fist guest tonight is from the one cooking show that has actual humor and real food. From the hit t.v. show 'Cooking with James' , the co-star of the show. Migos Username! Migo!\" yelled Conan. Migo walked into the room and waved at the crowd as they cheered him on. He sat down on his seat comfortably, shook hands with Conan and began the interview. \"It's a pleasure to have you here. It really is. I just love your show.\" \"Thanks.\" \"I think the show is pure genius. It has real comedy and real food in the same show which is very hard to find. But I have to ask you one question:\" \"Sure.\" \"Do you think that the only reason people watch it is because of Rocky Pinnicle's cameos?\" \"Well, I think that is the reason some boxing fans watch it.\" \"Some boxing fans? What do the other ones watch for? I'm a boxing fan and the only reason I got into the show was because I heard Rocky was on it.\" \"Well that's what get's them in, but then we keep them with our humor and good recipes.\" \" I've noticed Rocky doesn't seem to like much of what you have on the show. You want to share with us one of his favorite recipes?\" \"Rocky really likes the Boxer's Drink.\" \"And what is that? Gatorade or Powerade?\" \"Actually, it's egg yolk in a glass.\" Migo said as the crowd cried \"iwwww.\" In disgust. \"Egg yolk in a glass?\" said Conan with a semi-snorting laugh. \"Yes. You take some eggs, and you crack them. And then the egg yolk goes into the glass. And then you drink it.\" \"This sounds like something my wife made once.\" \"Would you like to try some?\" \"You know, I would but we are out of eggs in the NBC studios kitchen. Brokaw ate them all before he left, so-\" \"I've got some eggs Conan!\" yelled Max as he held up a box of eggs. \"…I'm not gonna even ask why you have those with you.\" Conan said to Max which was followed by laughter from the crowd. \"But still, I don't have glass.\" \"It just so happens that I have a glass.\" Said Migo. \"You have a glass with you? Where do you people keep this stuff?\" \"I don't have it with me, but I can summon it. James taught me a little bit of the dark arts.\" \"Really? This should be interesting. Let's see your dark magic.\" Migo's eyes rolled into the back of his head. The lights flickered on and off until they went off entirely. Then a puff of yellow smoke appeared and the lights turned on. And on Conan's desk and a scary gauntlet appeared on the desk. \"Well, crap. I knew I should've had coffee tonight! Oh well, crack the eggs.\" The eggs were cracked. And then Conan drank the drink. \"What do you think?\" \"There's a reason Rocky Pinnicle can handle anything.\" Conan mumbled queezily. The crowd laughed. \"Migo, everybody! When we come back, Bovine Sith will be here!\" Conan told the audience truthfully. For when the commercials were done and over with, Conan and Migo sat waiting for Bovine. \"Our second guest tonight is an author who makes Stephen King seem like A.A. Milne. Presenting Bovine Sith!\" yelled Conan as the dark figure loomed into his seat, shaking Migo's hand as Migo moved to another seat, and shaking Conan's afterward. \"It's great to have you here.\" \"It's great to be here.\" \"You have a very interesting name. How did you come up with such a name?\" \"Well, I had an obsession with cows and took the name Darth Cow. Eventually I expanded on that name with Bovine Sith.\" \"I went through a cow phase myself.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes, but it ended after a big incident with three midgets and a Canadian officer.\" The crowd laughed at the comment. \"So I understand you know Rocky Pinnicle?\" \"To an extent. I've mostly just written stories about him and the cast of NC on the Neptune Circle forums.\" \"I joined the forums.\" \"Did you?\" \"Yes. John Stewart and me joined. He said we could pick up chicks.\" \"John Stewart lied. And aren't you married?\" \"I wasn't looking for me. I was looking for Triumph. He's very shy online.\" \"That's surprising. So did you read any of my stories?\" \"I've read a few of your stories and let me just say this: you have a sick and twisted mind.\" Conan said and got a laugh. \"I saw Gigli and this gave me even more nightmares.\" \"Still using Gigli jokes?\" \"Well, they made me write the jokes for this one.\" \"Ah.\" \"But seriously, you write some pretty vivid stuff. Your most famous story is very scary, very well written and very suspenseful. But here is one thing I have to ask. Why wasn't P.J. the villain?\" \"P.J. just doesn't make a good villain.\" \"But P.J. is cool!\" \"P.J. is funny, not evil.\" \"We can debate this all night. I've got the time. I usually have time to kill so we can fight about this all night!\" the crowd cheered. \"Any other comments?\" \"It took very long for me to figure out who the killer was. At one point I just skipped the last chapter and started reading backwards until I found out who the killer was.\" \"Well Conan, I wanted to try and keep the killer a secret as long as possible to increase the dramatic effect.\" \"Well, that just got me angry. I'm used to just talking to movie stars, but for you I had to actually expand my mind.\" \"Heh. Sorry about that.\" \"Now, you've written some other works on the site. Are there any you are particularly proud of? I, myself, enjoyed Fortune Teller Sith.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" \"I didn't like that one. I felt I could've done better. It felt like I just threw it together.\" \"Well, I'm not saying it's better than Lord of the Yanmas. I think your fic is an excellent piece of work.\" \"It probably is.\" \"It probably is. How many people say that about their work besides the president?\" \"Heh. No, it's not that it isn't a good piece of work. Far from it, it's just that people's worst critics are usually themselves.\" \"You haven't watched this show before, have you?\" \"Okay, second worst critic.\" \"Thank you!\" \"Heh. So I was listening to your monologue and you might not have known about this little piece of info. China is part of the Soviet Union. And of course Cuba is, who happens to be right by us.\" \"Well we all knew about Cuba. But you are saying that China is now part of the Soviet? China is already huge!\" \"I know. There seems to be a sort of power struggle going on within the government between the Russians and the Chinese. The Chinese only joined because of debt problems, but they want to take control and be the supreme nation in the union.\" \"Wow. I didn't know that. Would you look at that? We are out of time. It's been great having you here.\" Said Conan as he shook Bovine's hand. \"I'll still be here after commercials.\" \"I know, but most celebs can't wait to get out of here so it's sort of a habit. Bovine Sith everybody! When we get back, the world heavyweight champion of boxing Rocky Pinnicle!\" Thus did the commercials air. And then it came time for Rocky to appear. \"Our next guest tonight is the heavyweight champion of the world. He just defeated his most fearsome opponent he has ever faced, Clubber Lang, and won back the title. The Mountain Peak…Rocky Pinnicle! Rocky!\" yelled Conan as the band began playing Rocky's theme. Rocky came out, wearing a early twenties hat and sporting a black eye to go with it. He smiled as he waved to the people and happily shook the hands of Conan, Migo and Bovine before he sat down. \"It's an honor to have you on this show.\" \"Tha-\" \"And I'm not just saying that so you won't beat me up.\" Rocky gave a hearty laugh to Conan's jest before the Irish comedian continued. \"That is a nice hat. I wish I hat a hat like that.\" \"Thank you.\" \"It'd be nice but my hair would just sorta pop it off after it was on my head for three seconds.\" Yet again Conan got laughs. \"So where'd you get the hat?\" \"A friend gave it to me.\" \"You didn't have a black eye after the fight. Where'd you get the black eye?\" \"Same friend.\" Rocky said. This time the crowd laughed at Rocky's true joke. \"You have some pretty screwed up friends.\" Said Conan. The crowd laughed as they began to think of the cast of Neptune Circle. \"You wanna know something?\" \"What?\" \"Even now that I'm so famous, we've only sold about 3 pieces of merchandise on the site, not including the ones we bought for ourselves.\" \"Wow. That is pathetic.\" Said the talk show host as the crowd burst with laughter. \"Maybe you should try getting professional models as opposed to that one angry looking kid.\" \"I've been thinking about it, y'know. It costs a lot to keep the site running and we need the money from the merchandise.\" \"But you are the heavyweight champ. You do get paid a lot.\" \"That is true. The job pays well. But all the money I get goes straight to charity.\" \"Wow. You're a nice guy, taking all those hits for others. Rocky, I heard that you were going to retire. Is this true? Will the final bout that Rocky gives us be Rocky Pinnicle vs Clubber Lang?\" \"Well, I was going to retire because I don't want to get used to all that fancy living and such, y'know? It gets ya weak. So then I decided that I would start a charity foundation and put all of my boxing earnings into that. So boxing would just be my hobby of sorts.\" \"Your hobby?\" \"Yes.\" \"As long as you aren't retiring, that's good with me. So what do you think about the whole Soviet situation.\" \"Well…Tssh. To bad Maci isn't here. I myself don't really care much about the new Cold War. I never understood all the fear and hatred. I say that we should all just be peaceful.\" \"This is coming from a guy who fights people for a hobby.\" \"Hahahaha,\" Laughed Rocky. \"What do you plan on doing once your career is over with?\" \"Well, I was hoping to make a living off of my flash skills.\" \"You are a skilled flash artist. I hope it works out for you.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Rocky Pinnicle everybody!\" Conan yelled loudly. After the commercials he introduced Papa Roach and allowed him to play his song. \"Cut my life into pieces This is my last resort Suffocation no breathing Dont give a #$ if I cut my arm bleeding This is my last resort Cut my life into pieces I've reached my last resort Suffocation no breathing Don't give a#$ if I cut my arm bleeding Do you even care if I die pleading Would it be wrong, would it be right If I took my life tonight Chances are that I might Mutilation out of sight And I'm contemplating suicide Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind Wish some body would tell me I'm fine Losing my sight, losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine I never realized I was spread to thin Till it was to late and I was empty within Hungry, feeding on chaos and living in sin Downward spiral, where do I begin It all started when I lost my mother No love for myself and no love from another Searching to find a love up on a higher level Finding nothing but questions and devils Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind Wish some body would tell me I'm fine Losing my sight, losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine Nothing's alright, nothing is fine I'm running and I'm crying I'm crying I'm crying I'm crying I'm crying I cant go on living this way Cut my life into pieces This is my last resort Suffocation no breathing Don't give a #$ if I cut my arm bleeding Would it be wrong would it be right If I took my life tonight Chances are that I might Mutilation out of sight And I'm contemplating suicide Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine Losing my sight, losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine Nothing's alright, nothing is fine I'm running and I'm crying I CAN'T GO ON LIVING THIS LIFE Can't go on Living this way Nothing's alright\" Conan and the other walked on the stage after the song was over. \"I'd like to thank all of our guests! Rocky Pinnicle, Migo, Bovine Sith, and Papa Roach! See you all next week!\" yelled Conan as the show ended and the credits rolled. Conan headed to the parking lot while Rocky, Migo and Bovine headed to the roof. \"You guys coming over for John's birthday?\" asked Rocky. \"That's tonight?\" asked Migo. \"Yeah.\" Replied Rocky. \"I'm not sure I can come. I've got homework. Plus I live pretty far away.\" Migo said quietly. \"Come on! You guys can stop for a few minutes to wish him a happy birthday!\" \"But my present is at my house.\" Bovine retorted. \"Same here.\" Migo chimed. \"Well let's hurry up and grab those gifts! I'll go with Migo and give him a Kamehameha boost to his house. You meet us at John's, okay?\" \"Got it.\" Replied Bovine Sith. Thus did all of them fly into the night sky. Ten minutes later they all arrived at John's front door. Rocky grabbed the doorknob and lead them in. Shalashaska and James were sitting on the couch, watching Buff the Vampire Slayer. Eyes glued to the screen, they did not even notice Rocky and the others enter the room. \"Hey, guys.\" Rocky said as he casually entered. \"Shhh!\" screamed James, who had not yet seen this episode. Shala had seen every episode, yet he enjoyed the occasional re-run. \"We're here.\" Rocky told everyone in the room. \"Rocky! Hey, what's up?\" asked James as he got up. \"Nothing much. We were on Conan's show.\" \"Really? We missed it. Buffy Marathon, y'know.\" Shala said to Rocky. \"Don't worry, I have the VCR set upstairs.\" Rocky grinned. \"I'm glad you're here because I was getting hungry.\" Said James as his stomach growled. The group went into the dining room, where John sat, making some sort of flash on his laptop. \"I've had time to make three games.\" John muttered when he heard them enter, not even looking up from his laptop. \"Sorry, we're late.\" Rocky told John cheerfully. John closed the file and shutdown his laptop. \"If we waited any longer it'd be my next birthday.\" Said John as he closed the laptop. \"Bovine, Migo! Glad you could make it!\" \"We can't stay long. We got to head home. We just came to wish you a happy birthday and drop off our presents.\" \"Thanks guys.\" Said John as they set down the gifts on the gift table. \"Happy birthday.\" Migo said as he left. \"Happy Birthday.\" Bovine said as he left. And then the room was silent, except for P.J. lazily twirling a noise-maker. Rocky then asked John \"Are you ready for your present?\" \"Is it in the driveway?\" asked John. \"Here, limme dim the lights to set the mood.\" Said Rocky as the lights dimmed. Suddenly, Boot hovered in, holding John's cakes and with techno music coming out of it's speakers. \"What? The cake?\" asked John quizzically. \"No, not the cake! Can't you tell that I rewired Boot to make him run more efficiently?\" asked Rocky. John looked at Boot. \"I can tell by the slight glitter build up on the outside that you tried switching the X and Z cables with Carbon based fluid as opposed to Oxygen based fluid. However the energy burst is only temporary and harmful if used for too long. But a nice attempt.\" Rock sighed. What could he get a computer genius that the genius couldn't make it himself in five minutes. John looked at the cake that Boot set down. He made a mental note to fix Boot as he looked at his cake, with a picture of the flash version of himself on the cake, except wearing a ninja outfit but no mask on his head. \"That's a good lookin' guy.\" John joked as the cake was cut and the pieces were handed out to everyone in the room. After that, it was time to open presents. P.J. had gotten John a hat in which you can drink beverages without hands. Migo had gotten John a cookbook. James got John a very long chain. Chad got John some underwear (thankfully unused). Maci gave John a M-16. Bob gave John a dead Squirrel. Clarence gave John a fruitcake. Taarin and Cat had given John a big box of chocolates. Shala got John a copy of Chrono Trigger. Boot gave John an upgrade on John' laptop. Bovine Sith gave John a Smart Board, which John of course loved since he could see his flash movies on a screen bigger than a television. Fargoth and Cyber B made John a flash movie together using sprites Cyber made. \"Well, that's all of them.\" John said, happy with his presents. \"Wait, there's one more.\" Said Cat as she picked up the last present which seemed to be the size of one of the newer Harry Potter books. John grabbed it and looked at the label. It was from BearFrog. \"BearFrog? I didn't see him come here.\" Said John as he tore open the present to find to video tapes. One was labeled 'A Christmas Carol' and the other was labeled 'Fight Remix'. John laughed at loud as he remembered when BearFrog had told him about these tapes. A Christmas Carol was a school project when he used Video from RPG Maker and Audio from The Muppet Christmas Carol. Fight Remix was a video tape with an hour of non-stop fighting. John set them down and noticed a sticky note on the back of Fight Remix. John tore it off and began reading. I Dear John, Happy Birthday! I hope you enjoy the presents. I'm sorry I could not join you on this occasion, but I have very important matters to attend to. I'll see ya later. -BearFrog /I BearFrog was in China. He was with the rest of the crowd who were all on the Great Wall. Next to the wall, a ring had been made. This ring was to host the Soviet Union's Heavyweight World Amateur Championship Boxing Match. This match was Communist vs Communist, Russia vs China. This fight was not only going to decide their champion, but also which side would take political control. This bet had many people anxious. However, almost nobody in the outside world knew about the wager, let alone the match. Yet BearFrog did know, and he was there. He had to see if the rumors were true. He had to see the… Super Warriors. Suddenly, music began playing. Very light music, played on some sort of string instrument. Then BearFrog saw the first contestant walk towards the ring, punching the air as he moved. He was wearing no robe, but he was wearing red shorts with yellow stars. His gloves were the same too. His face was a little deformed and he had very large eyes. The Asian man punched the air real hard so anyone who knew enough about Ki could feel his power. And BearFrog felt it. The power this fighter had was a little bit shocking, but still it was probably just the one boxer. The rumor about the Super Warriors couldn't be true… The man stood in the ring as he waited for his Russian rival to enter the ring. He danced around as he waited. Then suddenly, a hole in the ground opened up. Smoke appeared. Nobody could see. Then the smoke cleared and the giant behemoth of a Russian stood in his corner of the ring, eyes staring at nothing in particular. His crew was right there behind him. The Russian had his blonde hair raised so it looked like a crew cut. His size, over seven feet. His muscles, gigantic. His emotion, none. And his shorts, depicting his nation's symbol of a hammer and sickle with a star. BearFrog could feel no energy specialties for this one and assumed Joe Chan would easily win. \" Ladies and Gentleman! \" cried the Russian announcer. BearFrog got an F in Russian class, but was glad he at least knew some of the language so perhaps he could find out a little about the opponents. \" Welcome boxing comrade vs comrade. \" BearFrog heard the announcer say. He silently cursed himself for not trying harder in Russian class. He did try hard, true, but not as hard as he could have. He focused himself more and tried to grasp what the man was saying. \" Tonight great match. In Red corner, from Cheng Du, China and weighing 86 kilos, The Eastern Dragon: Quick Fists Joe Chan! \" cried the announcer as he pointed to the thin Asian. \" And in the yellow corner, from Moscow Russia! Weighing in at 118 kilos, The Siberian Bull! Ivan Drago! !\" BearFrog looked intensely at Drago. Drago seemed so emotionless, and yet…so powerful. The presence BearFrog felt was one that could only be felt if one had a true understanding of Ki, for Ivan's Ki was well hidden. Surpressed. Yet BearFrog could feel the destructive power and had now assumed the victor, but he knew to never count out the little guy. The fight began with the ringing of a bell. Ivan and Joe circled each other, trying to get a feel for their opponent. Chan decided to throw a few test punches at Drago. A right to the head. Another right to the head. And another right. Then a left. \"How can this short guy's arms reach up there?\" BearFrog said aloud in his natural tongue. Someone turned and looked at BearFrog face and then walked toward a Chinese soldier. The officer came up behind BearFrog and put his hand on BearFrog's shoulder. BearFrog's turned quickly. \" Excuse me, sir but I will need you to come with me. \" the man said in Chinese, which BearFrog did not understand in the least. \"No hablo ingles, I mean uhh…\" BearFrog said struggling to find the right words in Russian. \"American!\" yelled the Chinese man in a way that BearFrog could clearly understand. He jumped off of the tower and landed ringside. They began shooting at BearFrog until a Russian politician of some sort shouted at them and apparently told them to stop shooting. However, the men did come to attack the alien. Joe Chan was wondering why his opponent was standing there taking blows. Joe began throwing hard punches and yet the giant remained still. He began giving all he had and then suddenly, he felt a gigantic blow to the gut. One punch knocked him down in the first round. Joe lost. \"I don't want to hurt anyone, so please don't fight me.\" BearFrog told them calmly. Even if they could understand, the response would have been the same. The group of soldiers attacked BearFrog with broadswords in hand. BearFrog easily dodged all of the blows and defeated all the guards by pushing on a pressure point in the back of their necks, which put all of them in a temporary coma. \" Our comrade won the fight, so we get control as agreed. \" the Russian Premier said to the Chinese leader. The fat man grumbled at that but nodded. \" Wow, what skill. \" commented one Chinese politician. \" Yes, Ivan fought amazingly. \" the new leader cried happily. \" No, that intruder. His skill is amazing. \" The Premier looked out of the glass booth and saw the intruder. It was obviously a young American, but his skill was quite interesting. Not all Americans even knew about Ki and yet this one understood it. Well. \" Why don't we have a little fun? \" the Premier suggested as he took out his cell phone. At ringside, Ivan's trainer took out his phone and understood the instructions. Just as BearFrog tried to leave, Ivan exited the ring and punched at BearFrog who jumped up and landed on Ivan's outstretched arm and then kicked Ivan in the face before jumping to the ground. But the kick seemed to do nothing. \" Well, you're pretty strong aren't you? \" said BearFrog grinning. Ivan responded by throwing punches at BearFrog, who dodged them by jumping backwards. Then he was up against the wall. Ivan threw a punch and BearFrog jumped over Ivan, whose punch made a huge dent in the wall. \" Stop toying with him, Ivan! \" yelled his trainer. \"Toying with m-oof!\" cried Bearfrog as he felt a large hand punch him in the gut. BearFrog fell to the ground, coughing up blood. Ivan loomed over him. Just as he was about to finish him, BearFrog got up. He got on his feet, and looked at Ivan intensely. The politicians were shocked that he got up. Joe Chan, the Chinese champ couldn't even go that far against Ivan. \"Hammer Fist!!\" yelled BearFrog as he jumped in the air and chopped Ivan hard on the skull with a clenched fist. No damage. Ivan then punched BearFrog in the head. BearFrog managed to stay up for about five punches before he fell to the ground and faded into darkness. B Two Months Later… /B \"I can't figure out what the problem is.\" Rocky said as he paced back and forth. John began typing things on the computer and found that it did nothing. The screen remained a glowing blue. John did not want to admit it to Rocky, but the same thing had happened to his computer too and he had no idea how to fix it. His frustration was easily seen. \"Chill out man, okay? Why don't you take a break and read one of my magazines for a while.\" \"Sounds good. Anything new?\" \"I didn't really look at the mail but I'm due for a new Sports Illustrated.\" John gave a grunt as he got up from the couch and then suddenly gasped when he noticed he was sitting on a sleeping Chad. \"Chad! I'm sorry, I didn't see you! Are you okay?\" cried John as Chad opened his eyes slightly. \"Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…\" While John was talking to Chad, Rocky shuffled through the mail and tossed John his new Sports Illustrated. On the cover was Ivan Drago. It was a close up of his head. He wasn't looking at the camera, which took the picture of him on his side. He seemed to be staring at nothing. The cover story was \"Russians Invade U.S. Sports\" \"What?! The Soviet Union is sending athletes into our sports?!\" John said frantically as he turned to read the article. \"What's the big deal?\" \"This is the first contact we've had with the new Soviet Union except for their declare of independence!\" Rocky still didn't understand what the big deal was and decided he might as well read and hope that clears things up for him. The article was called \"Smash and Splash\". The article explained that a Soviet was entering boxing. The article was about the boxer, Ivan Drago who was currently the champion in the Soviet Union and was referred to as \"The World Heavyweight Amateur Champion\". John pointed out to Rocky that Drago was married to a famous Olympic swimmer from the Soviet Union who was coming, but Rocky didn't seem to notice why that piece of information was important. \"Look! It says that they are landing today, with the Russian Premier!\" John cried. The article was correct. The plane landed in Los Angeles, California. Thus did the trio exit the plane, along with other Russians and Chinese men, and faced a media swarm once they entered the airport. \"How long are you here for?\" \"Can I ask you a few questions?\" \"When will your first fight be?\" The reporters were pushed back by security and the only response they got from the communists was from their leader who simply said \"We talk later.\" \"Why is the Soviet Union entering professional sports?\" \"We shall answer all questions at the conference!\" the premier told the crowd as they walked. At the same time in the same city, Apollo was in his pool, relaxing. He was playing fetch with his three golden retrievers and having a fun time. The television he had outside near the pool was on, and a commercial for catfish was on. It had quite a pleasant tune. After the commercial ended the real show was on. \"Today, Russia has told the world that they will be throwing their hat into the ring. The prize ring, that is.\" The reporter announced. Apollo turned his attention to the television. \"The announcement was made by Ludmilla Drago, she was the double gold medalist in swimming.\" The screen switched and showed a beautiful blonde woman with short hair and big blue eyes. She was speaking. \"Today the Soviet Union has officially entered professional boxing. My husband and great undefeated World Heavyweight Amateur Champion, Captain Ivan Drago,\" she said as the camera switched to large man wearing a soviet officer uniform. \"Has come here with his trainers to compete as an international sportsman and an ambassador of good will.\" \"Has Drago ever faced off against a real professional?\" asked one reporter. \"From being trained in Russia by great boxing coach Manuel Rega and now by Sergi Rimski, \" she said as the camera switched to the trainers, who seemed to be in their late fifties or early sixties. \"We can only hope that he is qualified to do so.\" \"Hope?\" \"Well, I know he is but we don't want to sound too confident.\" \"If possible,\" the premier began, \"We would like to have an exhibition bout with your famous champion, Rocky Pinnicle.\" \"What makes you think he can defeat Rocky Pinnicle?\" \"There is nobody who can match his speed, endurance or his aggressiveness.\" \"You make it sound like he is indestructible.\" \"Yes, he is.\" The screen switched back to the main room. \"Well, can this behemoth who has already been nicknamed 'The Siberian Bull' wreak havoc upon the professional ranks? Only time will tell.\" Apollo looked at the screen angrily and tossed the ball out of the pool. He hit the water as he swam towards the steps to exit. Ring! Ring! Ring! \"Hello?\" \"John, do you think you could help me? Something's wrong with my computer. It's just a blank blue screen.\" Asked Jester on the phone. \"Rea-Hold on, I've got another call.\" Said John as he pushed the button. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, John I think my computer has a virus or something.\" Said Iblackedout. \"A virus! That's it!\" yelled John. \"I'll get back to you later!\" he yelled to IBO and Jester and at the same time (he pushed the 3-way calling button so he wouldn't have to repeat his message. John ran up to his room and saw Boot lying on the ground. \"Boot?! Are you okay?!\" John asked. John got no response and realized that this strange virus must have gotten Boot too. John was worried so he flipped on to the news and saw that his fears were confirmed. \"Every Computer in the United States and many other nations seems to be infected with some sort of virus. All the computer factories are shut down due to technical errors with the computers they use, and thus no computer can be used at this time.\" Said the reporter nervously. John had to fix this problem fast, or this would cause mass hysteria. John quickly took out spare parts from his television, phone, microwave, radio and typewriter to make a new computer from scratch. He hooked it up to his smart board so he could have a screen to look at as he entered his text (nothing to make a mouse was available) to search the net. The virus seemed to be on the entire internet. Every site with English text was replaced by a swirling black vortex page. John decided he might as well hack into this page and see what he could find. Code html x swf.file/ 834647/ fmx/ 86586/ 9092746759575663/ -vnrir-05nw/h4ckorzf113/ AOB/$8h B Access Denied /B \"What the? That's my best hacking code! Maybe there is a firewall against it. I guess I'll try out my old one.\" Code fhgnGR4g56748n$G :/hdnrtj4984n/jrhn483&46fvuy3#5/omega.htm B Access Denied /B \"Gah. Whoever did this is good. I guess I have no choice.\" John said to himself. He had no choice but use a virus to destroy it. It was very risky, since his virus threatened to destroy the entire online world, but he had no choice but to send it out. He had to time this right and destroy his virus as soon as it destroys the current virus, or else his creation will surely destroy the entire internet in a matter of minutes. Upload File: My Computer:My Documents: apocalypse.vrs The file was put on the internet. It floated around the cyberspace looking for the biggest thing it could devour. It then saw the gigantic virus that was plaguing computer users all across the globe and decided to make that become its first meal. John began to sweat profusely. His hands twitched on the near the keyboard as he waited for his virus to attack. Slowly his virus entered the demonic web page that held the virus. His virus appeared on the screen. \"Dadadadada! MMMMMBOB!\" cried the 16-bit pixilated Bob as it thunder shocked the virus and then began to eat it. \"Tastes like squirrelie!\" Upload File: My Computer:My Documents: savior.avrs The virus that caused blue screens was gone. Now a new virus remained. But it was soon defeated by the anti-virus which John made. A 16-bit pixilated Squirrel John made. \"Die Squirrelie!\" yelled Bob as she did a thundershock to the squirrel. The anti-virus fell down and had swirly eyes, until Bob walked up to it and ate it. The Squirrel, however, was toxic to the virus. Bob turned purple and fell down and said \"Blarg! I am dead!\" and then depixelized. John gave a sigh of relief and picked up his laptop. The screen had returned to normal. \"Where did that virus come from?\" John said out loud. Boot replied with a bunch of blips and beeps (he had turned back on). \"You're right, it's best not to worry. After all, how could they make a virus better than that?\" John and Boot exited the house and walked over to the street sign that told people they were now on Neptune Circle. That was where everyone would meet up and talk about how their day was. Everyone was there. \"Man, looooong day.\" John said exhaustedly. \"What'd you do today?\" asked Cat. \"I got rid of that virus that was messing with everyone's computers.\" \"I think the government put out that virus, to stop the spread of info about their corrupt organization.\" Maci told the group. \"I ate five gallons of icing.\" P.J. proudly announced. \"How is it that you stay alive?\" Cat asked. \"Me and Bob killed 1000 squirrels.\" Shalashaska told them. \"I killed REAL squirrelies, you just played that game.\" Bob replied. \"I did a new episode of Cooking with James.\" James told the group. \"I slept all day…\" Chad told everyone. \"I had time to re-read 'How to do everything with Flash MX'.\" Rocky said. \"I got a new pair of socks!\" Clarance said excitedly. RING! RING! RING! Rocky opened up his cell phone and answered. \"Hello? Oh, hey Apollo. What's up? What am I doing, I'm doing nothing. What are you doing? Come over? Okay. See ya in a few.\" Said Rocky as he hung up. \"Apollo's coming over for dinner.\" \"We can eat at my place, since nobody's home tonight.\" James offered as he pointed to big black scary looking house, which had dark clouds above it. Suddenly a flash of lightning bolted to the ground and gave a gigantic sound as if the earth was in pain. \"Okay, I'll wait outside him.\" Rocky said as the group entered the house. A few minutes later Apollo appeared over the horizon and landed in front of Rocky. \"Hey mountain.\" Apollo said with a grin. \"Yo Apollo!\" said Rocky as they did a handshake in which their hands met for a brief second and slip off of each other's smoothly. \"We're eating at James' tonight. Follow me.\" Said Rocky as the walked towards the house with Apollo following. Shala was in the living room watching Buffy when John came in suddenly and changed the channel to the news. \"Hey!\" \"You've seen every episode before so let me watch the news.\" \"Fine.\" The screen showed a laboratory. The first thing the camera sees is a large pillar like device with 3 screens on it in a triangle formation. The top one and the one on the right show Ivan Drago in infa-red and the other one shows his vital status. \"My husband and I thank you for coming to our training quarter today,\" Ludmilla said as the camera shifted to her. \"As you can see, it is highly advanced and we wish to show the American press a small portion the advancements our country's made in the technology of human performance.\" \"Deja vu, huh?\" whispered one reporter to his colleague, who giggled quietly. The camera the zoomed in on a demo screen of infa-red Drago punching some sort of punching machine. Then the screen focused on a monitor which seemed to be infa-red versions of human cells beating like heartbeats. \"What does all of this do to enhance performance?\" one reporter asked Drago's trainer as the camera moved onto the trainer. \"Well-\" he began before the premier put his hand on the coach's shoulder saying \"If I may answer,\" \"It makes a man, a better man. A great athlete is super athlete by harnessing all of his strength. Though most of the world is ignorant in body chemistry we wish to…educate your country.\" Said the premier as the camera slowly moved to right, moving past Ludmilla who was standing next to him until it got to a side view of Drago, who was wearing a white tanktop and tight white shorts. On the top was the soviet symbol depicted in the color red. \"There have been rumors of blood doping and wide distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union. Has Drago participated in any such experiments?\" asked one reporter. \"No,\" said Ludmilla shaking her head smiling, \"Ivan is naturally trained.\" \"Then how do you explain his freakish strength?\" \"Like your Popeye: He ate his spinach every day.\" She replied jocundly. The crowd laughed. \"Shall we have a demonstration?\" asked the premier. \"Please.\" Said the reporter. \"Thank you,\" replied the premier as the camera shifted to pay more attention to Drago. He stood facing the punching machine, which looked like a square piece of a red heavy-bag on a spring like the kind of boxing gloves the Joker would use against Batman. \"A normal heavyweight averages seven-hundred and fifty pounds of pressure per square inch.\" Said the premier as Drago stood ready to punch. He looked at the premier, who nodded and then punched the machine. Above the machine was a black rectangular screen which normally had words slowly moving across it like in Stock Markets, but it suddenly stopped to relay a message. Drago's punch was 3850 Psi. \"The result is quite obvious.\" Said the premier. \"What result is that?\" asked the same reporter. \"Whatever he hits, he destroys.\" \"He didn't destroy me…\" BearFrog said with a smirk. He could not see the television broadcast but could hear it. The guards had a television in the dungeon to keep themselves occupied while they watched BearFrog. BearFrog was strapped to table via diamond restraints that looked like ordinary metal restraints. But these were much harder to break out of. BearFrog had endured a month of torture as the communists performed experiments on him (he hated the anal probe the worst) and was getting sick and tired of going through all of it. \"Will you talk today?\" asked the Russian general as he entered the room and turned off the television. The old general was in his sixties but had a gigantic body and was in amazing shape, yet his face showed that he was old even though he had quite a powerful look on his crew cut head. \"Tell me, where did you learn how to use your Ki?!\" asked the general angrily. \"You know, I'm just getting sick of this. I saved up enough energy to get out of here, so I'm gonna leave now. Bye.\" Said BearFrog as he suddenly moved his arms up and allowed the restraints to break in half. He then ripped of the restraints on his ankles and kicked the general in the gut. \" Comrade Picard! \" yelled one soldier before BearFrog knocked him into a wall with a punch. After knocking out the other guard BearFrog ran out of the high-tech torture chamber into the clean blue futuristic hallway. Suddenly, the lights turned red and the alarms were activated. \" Comrades! 2 intruders have escaped! \" yelled the voice. \"Two?\" BearFrog said out loud and then noticed was running alongside him. \"Turtle Man?! What the hell are you doing here?!\" Turtle Man replied with a shrug as they ran through the complex until they saw an open door and quickly entered. BearFrog pushed a button on wall and the door shut with a 'whoosh'. He gave a big sigh and then sat down on the floor. \"Dude, check it out! It's like Comp-USA, only better!\" cried Turtle Man. \"Comp-USSR…\" BearFrog muttered as he got up and looked around at the highly advanced room. The soviets must've been preparing a hostile take-over of the former republics for a while. After dusting off his butt, BearFrog walked towards a computer with Turtle Man following. The text was in Russian yet BearFrog slowly translated the material. It was a menu that had links to a few files. General Data Storage Doc 1. Re-unification Doc 2. H.D.P. Doc 3. D.O.A.S. \"Interesting.\" BearFrog said. \"What? I can't read Russian. What does it say?\" Turtle Man asked. \"It's some documents that the Soviet Union has kept. These documents probably explain some secret stuff, but not in detail that is too intense.\" \"You sure?\" \"We won't know until we try.\" BearFrog double clicked on the first document as the alarms went off (the soviets assumed they were long gone). Username : Password : \"What are you gonna do?\" asked Turtle Man. \"Take a stab at it.\" Username : Lenin Password : Access Granted \"What did you type in for a password?\" \"Ivan Drago.\" BearFrog said with a smirk. \"Man I'm hungry.\" Turtle Man announced. Elsewhere, a post dinner conversation was being held. The room was dark and gloomy with cobwebs on the wall. In the center of the room was a long black gothic table. Sitting there were the good folks who live on Neptune Circle and their guest from Las Angeles, Apollo Creed. \"He's trying to fight when he's an amateur. He's big and he's strong but he's clumsy. I know I can beat him.\" Apollo told the group. \"Why do you want to fight again?\" Cat asked softly. \"Let's just say that it's something I believe in.\" Apollo replied. \"Hey, don't you think people are expecting Rocky to take out this bum first?\" Maci asked. \"Yeah, he will. When it's for real. This is just an exhibition bout, kid's stuff.\" Said Apollo with a faint laugh. \"Why would you want to fight a big man like that? Why be at risk?\" Clarance asked. \"I don't this chump coming over with all this hype. Trying to make us look bad.\" Apollo said. \"But we ARE bad.\" Maci replied. Apollo ignored the comment and continued. \"With Rock's help we can get great media coverage, make them look bad for a change.\" Apollo said. Rocky's smile grew suddenly at the comment. \"I think it's wrong.\" Taarin protested. \"No, it's never been more right.\" Apollo replied. \"You haven't fought for a long time Apollo.\" Taarin began as Apollo and Rocky winked at each other. \"How much can you take? Either of you.\" she asked them. \"Taarin, we've fought tough enemies before and this guy is just some cocky foreigner.\" John said happily. \"Heck, Clarance could probably take him.\" The entire table roared with laughter except from Taarin and Cat, who kept their paranoid fears. \"Paranoid fears are what shall sustain the new government. If our people fear and hate foreigners, they cannot hate us.\" –Comrade Picard BearFrog gave a sigh as he exited out of the report and entered the next one. \"What did it say?\" asked Turtle Man. \"It pretty much told hold the Soviets entered every political office to make take-over easy and it also gave some ideas they had for government and took control over China since they needed money for their debt and Russia was going to give it to them, but they had to unite with their government. It's pretty much the same as the old soviet, except there is now no German Soviet republic and no Berlin wall but they've made up for it by making the Great Wall of China act like that.\" \"Why?\" \"To keep people contained.\" \"Anything else?\" \"Besides ending with an evil quote, no.\" While BearFrog began reading the next document, Bob nestled in her soft bed and fell to sleep while Rocky and Apollo sat up watching a big fight that was known as \"SuperFight 2\". \"And that's the end of that round! This doesn't look good for Apollo Creed. Now for Round 5. Bam! What a block. Creed is blocking Rocky's punches. His arms seem to be glowing! Pinnicle's punches seem to be glowing too! Some of them are getting through Apollo's blocking. OOO! Rocky took a big blow to the head. Dang, Apollo's fist looked like it was on fire!\" \"I feel like I'm getting punched just watching this.\" Rocky said. \"Mama Mia, what did you have in those gloves Mountain? Bricks?\" asked Apollo. \"Hey Apollo, can I ask you something?\" \"Yeah sure.\" Said Apollo who was focusing more on the fight than on Rocky's voice. \"Apollo, about this fight against the Russian. Do you think maybe…it isn't against him?\" \"If it isn't against him then who is it against?\" asked Apollo jocundly. \"I dunno. Maybe like you against you?\" \"You know I really think you are getting brain damage.\" \"Apollo, you're a great fighter but you aren't what you used to be. You don't want to believe it but maybe the show is over.\" \"Man, I'm not old! I've always been a fighter. \" \"Well, you haven't really had a big fight in a while. Maybe it's time to change.\" \"I don't want to change! We can't be born again, Mountain! I like who I am!\" \"I like who you are too, but you can't do that stuff anymore Apollo.\" Replied Rocky pointing at the screen. \"We've both weakened in peaceful times. We're changing. We're turning into regular people.\" \"Now that's where you're wrong, Mountain. You can't change what you really are. You and me, we don't even have a choice. You can't turn off and on like some radio. We have to be in the middle of the action cuz we're the warriors! If the warrior has no challenge then the warrior is better off dead. I'm asking you as a friend…stand by my side this one last time.\" \"You're a great talker Apollo. But when this is over…\" Rocky said with a grin. Apollo laughed. \"Man, I feel sorry for that guy. \" Rocky said as they gave each other five. The human development program shall create new super soldiers that do not require guns to combat. Many types of steroids are being used and modified until a super drug is made. But first heredity must be best so we unite best athletes to create best children. Drago's family has history of warriors. To test this we must have our first super warrior fight the greatest fighter in the world. \" \"I should've studied harder in Russian.\" BearFrog said to himself, getting annoyed with the Russian accented grammar. \"So what does this one mean?\" asked Turtle-Man. \"It means that they are making Drago act as a prototype super soldier, and they want to fight Rocky to test the power of him to see if this program is even worth it and also humiliate our country. If Drago wins they'll perfect their super soldier formula and begin finding ways of making more of it cheaply.\" BearFrog replied. \"Once they perfect one they'll begin mass-producing them.\" Many things are mass- produced, such as magazines. Many magazines about the Red Star vs Old Glory, Drago vs Apollo. Everyone seemed to have nicknames for them. One magazine had \"Superman vs Superhype\". There were many interesting cover stories like \"Las Vegas is the place for Apollo Creed's Gamble\". \"Mr. Creed, why do you feel the need to fight Drago?\" asked one reporter at the press conference. \"Let's just call it a sense of responsibility. I need to teach this newbie how to box!\" Apollo replied happily. \"Don't you think he's a little in-experienced to be in the same ring?\" \"Well, some folks just have to learn the haaard-way.\" Apollo told them, which got a laugh. \"Rocky, how do you think Apollo should fight Drago?\" \"Well…\" said Rocky, turning to look at Drago who was seated next to Apollo. \"I think the first thing Apollo needs is a ladder.\" The crowd laughed. \"Drago! How does it feel to spar with the great former champion?\" \"…\" Apollo looked at Drago and then the crowd and repeated the motion and followed it with \"The man's tongue didn't come through customs!\" which of course got a large hearty laugh from the reporters. \"My husband is very happy to have this opportunity. It's his dream.\" Ludmilla told the crowd. \"Dream?\" one reporter asked. \"In our country Apollo Creed is well known and very respected. It will be a good victory.\" \"Wait a minute. Win?\" Apollo asked. He looked up at Drago. \"You don't really think you're gonna whip me, do ya?\" \"We did not come here to lose.\" Ludmilla replied. \"You hold on, little lady, you hold on; Cuz lose and lose royally he's gonna do!\" \"How can you be so sure?\" \"Well, I've been with the best and I've beat the best. I've retired more men than social security.\" Apollo replied with laughter in his voice. \"Excuse me,\" the premier started, \"You are not very realistic, are you Mr. Creed?\" \"Where did you come from, what're you talking about?\" \"You can box, yes, but you have not fought or trained intensely for such a long time that it is impossible for you to win over Drago.\" \"Is that a fact?\" \"Yes, and it could be a very painful one.\" \"You put that heavybag with eyeballs in the ring and you're gonna see the meaning of pain!\" Apollo yelled as he pointed at Drago. \"Why do you insult us?\" Ludmilla asked. \"Don't make me out to be the bad guy. I came here to talk about a friendly exhibition bout until comrade bigmouth started in!\" \"It is you who is the aggressor, Mr. Creed!\" yelled the premier. \"I wish to say to the press, in all fairness, Drago should not even fight this man because he is a hasbin!\" \"You get that big chump in the ring right now! Come on!\" yelled Apollo as he got up and was held back by Rocky and Apollo's trainer, Tony. Drago pushed Apollo back, and Apollo was kept up from the crowd on his half of the table. \"We'll finish this in the ring.\" Said Apollo as he headed to the right to make his leave. \"How did I do?\" asked Apollo. \"A little loud for my taste.\" Replied Rocky. \"But good?\" \"Oh, yes. Very good.\" As they exited the building, Drago threw the life size cardboard picture of Apollo to the ground with no emotion in his face. We must destroy our greatest enemy, The United States of America. To do so we must weaken them in every possible way. We shall give them false intelligence reports that will cause them to enter a war for the wrong reasons and therefore be unable to initiate pre-emptive strikes ever again. To cause mass hysteria we shall create several powerful computer viruses and put them onto the internet. We shall also cause large blackout that will take out more than 3 states. We shall make them think their economy is weak when it is strong. We shall corrupt their officials with bribes so that our interests can be met. We shall slowly sink that nation into the state of being a hell on earth. \" We found them! \" yelled three Russian guards as they entered the room. BearFrog quickly punched all of them in the gut, knocking them out. \"We've stayed here too long. Come on, let's go Rap Master Turtle.\" \"Alright, let's boogey.\" Turtle Msn said as he and BearFrog both raised their right hands in the air and blasted a whole through the roof. \" We have no choice but to begin operation statue early. Those Americans must be destroyed. \" the premier said on his cell phone. \" But the public will notice it quickly. \" replied Comrade Picard, the musclebound gray haired crew-cut wearing former boxing superstar. \" I shall contact Rega and tell him to put out all of his viruses at once. The Americans will focus on that so much they will not notice a statue missing. They are so stupid they do not even realize how perfectly built it is, and why it will be such a powerful warrior when we bring it to life. \" After the conversation ended, the Russian Premier contacted Manuel Rega, the soviet's best virus maker. He told Rega to set loose his viruses and he did. John first noticed it while in an online game. The large man in green pants and a black shirt walked through the base holding his machine gun until he saw an explosion. He ran into the control room. One of them was a slim female with blonde hair, another was a large man with red hair, and the other two were average except one had green hair and the other one had a robotic eye and was bald. Psykloak1: What happen? Fargoth: Someone set up us the bomb Pirogoeth: We are getting a signal. Largo: I-I47? Scotty: Main Screen turn on Blip. The screen turned on to reveal… Psykloak1: It's you. Dingus: Hahaha, how are you gentlemen? Dingus: All your base are belong to us. Dingus: You are on the way to destruction. Scotty: What you say? Dingus: You have no chance to survive. Make your time. Hahaha. Psykloak1: Y Disconnected from server. Attempting to re-connect… Re-connection failed. \"GAH!\" screamed John. Suddenly the phone rang. John answered. \"John, Dingus has hacked into the game! He can control our characters! He wants me to relay a message!\" \"Go ahead.\" John said as he grabbed a notepad and a pen. \"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Thanks Scotty.\" John then went to which had been hacked and turned into a digital arena of sort. The page seemed to be nothing but a black background, green binary and a few words to click on. John clicked on Enter as was immediately sucked into his computer and on the webpage. \"I've been waiting.\" Dingus said with a smile. \"Tell me something, Dingus. You are not that skilled in hacking. How could you hack an online game and get past my firewall?\" \"Why don't we make a wager? If you win, I'll tell you and take off all of the viruses and tell you where I got them. If I win you will be put in a html document and remain there forever.\" \"So this is it, huh? Some one doesn't want me around.\" \"Wow, that is so impressive Mr. Computer Genius.\" \"Well, shall we begin?\" \"Let's.\" Dingus lunged forward and punched John in the gut, who fell down hard. John's face was suddenly green and his face seemed to morphing as if he was made of pixels and they were rotating. \"I have the advantage, John, for I have viruses while you have nothing.\" Said Dingus with a smirk. John replied by lunging a fist forward himself, only to miss and be kicked in the back by Dingus and landing hard of the invisible floor once again. Dingus then stomped on John, and that stomp made the invisible floor disappear. Well, for John at least. Dingus stood up high as John fell far down with only the numbers speeding by for eyes to see. Then Dingus jumped down as held his two arms fully extended above his head and gave John a hard blow to the back. After that John landed and was back on solid ground. Although was the only place you could enter the digital arena, every other website in the world had a live view of the action and even the crappiest computers could see the fight. \"John!\" yelled StevenGuy. Suddenly NiGhTmArE88288 also appeared. \"We've come to help, John!\" cried NiGhTmArE88288. \"Bob's Best Friend will be here in a minute!\" yelled GadoTheLion. \"No! I have to fight alone, otherwise Dingus won't tell me where he got the viruses!\" yelled John. \"But John-\" protested StevenGuy. \"Don't worry guys. I can handle him. Now leave.\" Said John as he pointed to a button that was labeled Exit. All three of them double tapped it and then vanished out of cyberspace and back to their homes. \"You have no chance to survive. Make your time. Hahaha.\" Dingus said maliciously. John smirked and then his face turned to that of a fight and charged with a loud battle cry. He threw a punch and Dingus dodged by sliding to left with his arms crossed. John attacked again and missed the annoying enemy. He was starting to feel sick from the infected virus and began losing pixels in random places, like parts of his hand would vanish. \"What's wrong, Johnny? Can't handle it? You cannot win, for I am the superior hackor!\" John threw a kick and missed. Dingus replied by saying \"lol\". Dingus was enjoying himself and John was in intense pain. Dingus then decided to have a little fun and hack John. He stuck his arm into John's chest where his heart would be, and his arm went straight through. No blood or anything, but intense pain for John as he felt his digital self become corrupt with more deadly data. \"AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!\" screamed John. He finally got the strength to jump backwards from the attack and clutched his shirt in the area where Dingus' arm had been. \"Come now, Jonathan. This can't be your best.\" Said Dingus with a smirk. \"Where are those amazing hacking skills I've heard so much about?\" \"You want to see my true power? Fine.\" Said John as he crossed his arms and began spinning very fast. When the spinning stopped, a ninja stood before Dingus. \"I am Xy63r N1nja!\" I:h:e:a:r:t:B:o:B , Zeldarulah and Bobs Best Friends all sat together in the Bob fanclub along with Triumph the Insult comic dog, in awe at the amazing transformation that was just made. \"PH34R M4I L33T H4XX0R P0W4!\" cried Xy63r N1nja as he took out his sword. \"Bah, you cannot defeat me with such a pathetic weapon.\" Said Dingus as he took out a glowing red katana. \"YAAAA!!\" \"Y4444!!\" The blades met each other in fury. They had blocked each other's attack. The same happened again and again. Then suddenly the l33t ninja jumped high into the air and seemingly stabbed the air. Suddenly the numbers were constantly changing. They began hitting Dingus, and it was painful. Dingus fell to the ground, defeated, after taking many blows from many tiny numbers. \"I 4m t3h h4ck1ng m4s74.\" Said the ninja as he twirled and turned back into John Psykloak. \"A deal is a deal, Dingus.\" \"Fine,\" Dingus began, \"A rival of the U.S. wanted me to stop you from getting on computers so that nobody could stop them. You're skills rival that of an entire nation's. In exchange for stopping you and putting the viruses on the net, I was supposed to be given the power I need to defeat Pinnicle.\" \"Which nation offered you this power and gave you your mission?\" \"It was the-\" Dingus began before a white arrow suddenly landed on him and a menu bar appeared. It slowly moved down to delete. Dingus ran to the exit and left with fear. John quickly followed the suit, not wanting to be deleted. The moment he exited, the hackers decided it would be safer just to shut down their operation. Thus did everything on the internet return back to the norm. Everyone was talking about the internet crisis, and nobody really seemed to notice that the statue of Rocky Pinnicle was missing. Not even Rocky himself noticed, because he, Bob and Tony were busy training with the former champion. Apollo was greatly admired on the internet for facing the big Russian. He was fighting with the odds against him. That is what motivated Apollo during his training. His determination was stronger than ever. \"ARRGH!\" screamed Apollo as he switched arms. How Rocky managed to do such an exercise was a mystery to him. Switching arms while doing one-armed sit-ups…madness. Yet, it was insane training that allows one to take on the toughest opponents. And Apollo knew Drago was tough. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Apollo hit the sandbag extremely fast and extremely powerfully. He punched and punched until his attack cut through the bag and a new was needed. Apollo began following the training that Rocky did when he trained for Apollo including drinking egg yolk and punching raw meat. Apollo was getting stronger than he ever was before. There were some problems Apollo had, though. He could not seem to move around as fast or as smoothly as he used to, which was his reason for winning most of his matches. Also, when sparring, he seemed to damage much more easily than before. Apollo said that he made up for it with his increased strength and his better knowledge of fighting, and focused on improving those aspects more. He did improve slightly in the areas he was doing bad in, but not a great increase. Apollo also spent a week at an army base and did training alongside the soldiers. He himself was a soldier. He was fighting the Soviet Union just as these men might be in a few short months. They all knew this and greatly encouraged Apollo themselves. Apollo then went to New York and began training on the streets there. Then one day he decided to test himself if he was truly ready. He ran. He ran so fast that he was running on the water that surrounded the island. He ran and then he began to climb the gigantic green woman. His arms hurt, his muscles snapped. He kept on climbing, and climbing, and climbing until he reached the nose. He slowly forced his arms to move upward, and promised himself not to use any Ki. His arms seemed to bleed inside but he kept going. He slowly climbed to the top of the torch and threw his hands in the air and screamed with victory. \"Damn it's bloody cold. I'm all out of ki so I can't build a fire or fly out here.\" BearFrog said out loud as he rubbed his hands together. \"I didn't know you were British.\" Turtle Man said as he rubbed to sticks together. It was snowing ferociously outside, but luckily they had found a cave. \"I'm not, I just tend to use their way of speaking often.\" \"Ah…\" said Turtle Man as he failed to start a fire. Let's move our focus across the world in Las Vegas. In front of the Grand Hotel, there was a gigantic yellow glowing sign that had Apollo Creed vs Ivan Drago written on it and underneath the names were the names of the countries, U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. \"Welcome one and all to the city of lights, Las Vegas and to one of the most unusual events in years.\" Said an announcer. The two giant cardboard pictures of the fighters looked at each other in front of a fountain outside the Grand Hotel, which was gleaming with lights inside and out. \"East meets West. Age versus Youth in a good will exhibition match between the former champion Apollo Creed and the mountain of muscle from the Soviet Union, Ivan Drago.\" In the building, Apollo was in his dressing room. He had received many fruit baskets and flowers from people telling him to kick the commie's butt. He was not going to let them down. He also had a picture of Drago on the mirror. He was in his yellow shorts with red trim (the same gear he would be in the fight they were about to have) however this one had black marker on him. Devils horns and smoke snorting out of his nose, glasses and even a tail. And in the corner of the picture the words \"Creed was here\". \"Chill out dude. You have to get your gear on. There, now you look like a mummy.\" \"I feel like a mummy. I feel great, like I could eat nails.\" Said Apollo as he hit his fist while looking in the mirror. \"I never tried those things. Bob has, though.\" \"Wha?\" \"Snails. You know, I've seen them around the garden and stuff bu-\" \"Not snails, mountain, NAILS. Na-Na-Na-Nails.\" \"Oh yeah…Apollo try to de me a favor. When you go up there try not to over-do it, okay? Don't wear yourself out.\" \"Wear myself out, yeah. Like I'm going to do that. You're making me sound like I'm an old man when I'm in the best shape of my life.\" Said Apollo with a smirk as he stretched in front of the mirror. \"Yeah but if it was me I wouldn't mind postponing a couple of weeks…We don't know anything about this guy, Apollo.\" \"Postpone? Alright let's say I postpone, then what? Some other guy will come and take out this chump and where will I be left?\" \"Apollo this is just an Exhibition fight. This doesn't mean anything.\" \"What do you mean this doesn't mean anything?! This is us versus them man! Look, you may not know now what I'm talking about, but you will when it's over. Believe me…you will when it's over!\" While Apollo was in his bright dressing room, Drago stood in ring. It was a dark room which was fairly empty, except for that of the ring, himself and a few other Russians. The premier's voice echoed as he spoke Russian very fast and the only word any English speaking person would understand was the last word he spoke… \"Ivan!\" yelled the premier as he pounded his fists together. Drago looked to his left to see the leader of his nation standing next to his wife. He stared at them until they began walking up the concrete ramp to head into the main area, where their seats were located. The room where the show was to take place was beautiful. The walls were bright red, but not too bright, and the people were seated at elegant tables, including Rocky's girlfriend and Apollo's wife, who he had just recently married and had given birth to twins. She had lost the weight from pregnancy and was now in good shape. Ludmilla and the premier decided to walk over to Apollo's wife and have a little pre-match chat. \"Good luck. I hope after we can be friends.\" Ludmilla said. \"I hope so.\" Said Apollo's wife with a bit of suspicion in her voice. \"Of course. They're sportsmen, not soldiers.\" Ludmilla replied as she extended a hand. Apollo's wife became a little more at ease with the statement and smiled as they shook hands. After Ludmilla and the premier told her to enjoy the match they sat down in their seats, surround be miniature flag waving Americans. Suddenly the ceiling opened up above Drago as he stood in the center of the ring. The light gleamed and made his already bright yellow coat brighter. He looked up at the light and music began to play as the ring was moved up by a mechanical device. Drago was too busy looking up to notice the circle of stars on the blue ring under him. Suddenly Drago heard a man give a scream. He didn't give it much notice as he was too busy looking at all of the other stuff. He was amazed with all the bright lights and costumed dancing people and the gigantic American flag behind him. The fake planes that were flying above were truly amazing. If he was an American, however, he'd be more amazed of the man who screamed. The man who screamed was standing in front of the ring with a microphone in his hand. He was the Godfather of Soul…James Brown. \"Superhighways! Coast to coast! Easy takin' , anywhere! On the transcontinental overload, just slide behind the wheel. How does it feel?\" sang James Brown. \"When there's no destination-\" sand the backup singers. \"That's too far! And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are! Ow!\" sang the godfather. BOOM! Smoke came of from the nose of the gigantic statue of an bull head, which was placed behind the ring. On top of it was somebody dressed in a red white and blue top hat, wearing similar trunks, boots, gloves and vest. \"Living in America!\" \"Eye to eye - station to station!\" It was Apollo Creed, doing a 'I Want You' sort of this at Drago, though it was a little more difficult to get since he had gloves on. \"Living in America! Hand in hand - across the nation!\" \"Living in America!\" \"Got to have a celebration! Rock my soul!\" Apollo got down from the bull and began to dance a little outside the ring as the song played. \"Smokestack - fatback - many miles of railroad track. All-night radio keep on runnin' through your rock'n' roll soul. All-night diners keep you awake on a black coffee and a hard roll!\" \"You might have to walk a fine line! You might take a hard line!\" \"But everybody's workin'…overtime!\" \"Living in America!\" \"Eye to eye - station to station....\" Apollo had gotten into the ring by the time that lyric was sang, and he once again did the 'I Want You' thing to Drago. \"I live in America - I live in America - wait a minute - You may not be lookin' for the promised land, But you might find it anyway! Under one of those old familiar names like; New Orleans!\" \"New Orleans!\" the crowd replied. \"Detroit City!\" \"Detroit City!\" \"Dallas!\" \"Dallas!\" \"Pittsburgh P. A.!\" \"Pittsburgh P. A.!\" \"New York City!\" \"New York City!\" \"Kansas City!\" \"Kansas City!\" \"Atlanta!\" \"Atlanta!\" \"Chicago and L. A.!\" \"Living in America! Hit me! - Living in America - Living in America. I live in America - staying alive - we'll make the prime. I live in America - hey I know what it means. Living in America - hit me - eye to eye - station to station. Living in America - so nice - would you better stop? Living in America - I feel good!\" The crowd cheered fiercely as James Brown bowed and a cape was put on him. A hopping Apollo stood next to Rocky Pinnicle and Tony Duke was Ivan Drago stood stiff next to Manuel Rega (trainer and l33t hacker/virus maker) and Sergi Rimski. Flag waved powerfully as Apollo was given a high five by James Brown who then headed to his seat. \"Ladies and Gentlemen if you're just joining us now we're about to witness one of the most interesting events in boxing for years. For the first time ever, East meets West in professional boxing.\" Said one commenter. \"Thanks for getting me here, Mountain.\" Apollo said as his hat and vest were removed. \"No, we're even.\" Replied Rocky. \"God I feel born again…\" \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" the ring announcer began, \"I would like to announce the presence of a true fighting champion who defines the word courage…Rocky Pinnicle!\" \"Excuse me for one second, would ya?\" Rocky asked Apollo. Apollo extended an arm forward as Rocky went to the center of the ring and waved to the crowd. \"Tonight's special event features two great athletes! In the blue corner, weighing 221 pounds, former Heavyweight Champion of the World, the King of Sting, the Master of Disaster, the Count of Mounte Fisto, the-\" \"Think you got enough nicknames?\" Rocky asked Apollo. \"Patience, Mountain. Almost done.\" Replied Apollo with a smirk. The crowd cheered intensely as Apollo raised his arms in the air and spun around a bit. \"In the blue corner, weighing an even 261 pounds, the undefeated World Amateur Champion from the Soviet Union, the Siberian bull, Ivan Drago!\" The crowd reaction was the exact opposite of Apollo's. The crowd booed as they waved their American flags and the visiting soviets felt uneasy in their seats. The two fighters moved the middle of the ring and listened to the rules. \"Shake hands and let's have a good fight.\" Said the ref. \"Alright, it's time to go to school.\" Apollo said with a smirk as he winked at his teammates in the corner. Drago remained to have a blank expression on his face. \"What, do you need an interpreter? Put your hands up!\" yelled Apollo as he lifted up Drago's hands and hit them. They did not move. \"You will lose.\" Drago said quietly. He then smacked Apollo's hands, which fell quickly. \"The bad blood between these two can be felt all over this arena.\" Said one commenter. \"I just can't get over the size of this Russian.\" Said the other as Drago's robe was removed and underneath it was his yellow shorts with a red soviet symbol on it. \"It's showtime! It's showtime! It's showtime!\" Apollo yelled at the crowd. \"Excuse me. Are you forgetting something?\" asked Rocky as he held up the mouthpiece. Apollo gave a faint laugh as it was put into his mouth. \"Be back in a minute, alright?\" Apollo asked jocundly as the bell rang. The two fighters moved to the center of the ring. Apollo began circling around Drago and threw a light left. Drago moved forward as Apollo circled him and threw another quick left. Apollo then gave out two quick lefts and Drago walked backwards after getting hit. Apollo then moved forward but tripped. He managed to catch himself before he fell and then went back to moving on the Russian. \"This is bizarre. Creed is over the hill, and the Russian hasn't done anything yet.\" Said one commenter. Creed gave a strong left to the Russian and then a one-two combo. After that the Russian began moving forward and the yank began to retreat. He quickly moved forward and attacked Drago before moving backwards again. Apollo continued to attack but Drago began blocking Apollo's punches. \" Now Drago! \" yelled Sergi Rimski in Russian. Drago gave a powerful right hand to Apollo which knocked him backwards against the ropes. Drago began beating on the man viciously but solidly. \"Tie him up!\" yelled Rocky. Apollo did as he was told and embraced the Russian in a hug like position but was spun around and thrown into the far corner. Drago then continued began on Creed. The bell then rang, but Drago gave Apollo five extra punches for the road. Both sides of trainers went into the ring. Rocky carried Apollo away as Tony Duke yelled at the Russians. \"What the hell are you guys doing?! This is supposed to be an exhibition bout!\" Apollo blood began dripping on Rocky's white shirt. Rocky looked at Apollo's deformed face as he set him down on a seat in his corner. \"Champ, I've got to call the fight! You can't do any more out there!\" \"N-No…\" Apollo said faintly. \"He's killing ya! I've got to stop this fight.\" \"Rocky…as a friend…promise me you won't stop this fight…\" \"The Soviet's strength is incredible!\" yelled one commenter. \"You don't stop this fight…no matter what…\" said Apollo as he got up. His mouthpiece was put in. \"No matter what…\" Apollo turned to his wife, who face had gotten pale and her eyes bulging. He raised his arm slightly and gave a faint smile and then turned to face the Russian again. The bell had rung. Apollo began dancing a bit as he moved. He threw some punches at Drago, but all of them missed. None of them made contact with Ivan Drago's face. Then Drago countered with a right to the head. The blow caused blood and sweat to fly. Apollo tried to counter but missed. Then Drago continued attacking. Apollo was slowly being destroyed by the soviet soldier. Rocky ran and picked up the towel and looked into the ring. \"NO!\" yelled Apollo. Drago became more and more ruthless with his blows. He picked the places where the former champ would feel the most pain. He tortured him in the ring which was now red white and blue because of Apollo's blood dripping onto to it. \"Stop the fight!\" pleaded Apollo's wife from the crowd. Rocky listened and almost threw the towel until he heard Apollo yell \"NO!\" again. He grabbed the towel back before it slipped from his hands. Apollo's slaughter was continued. Ivan Drago would not let up on his attack. Apollo kept standing though. Even though it seemed like each blow would be his last he refused to give up. He was not going to give up…He was not going to lose…no matter what… \"Throw the damn towel!\" yelled Tony. \"NO!\" yelled Apollo. Rocky threw the towel in the ring one second to late. Drago gave his final punch of the match. The most powerful blow Apollo had ever felt had hit him. Drago moved backwards as he let Apollo's body fall to the ground. Rocky and Tony rang into the ring as Apollo's entire body twitched once. Soon many members of the press entered the ring and surround Apollo and Drago who was now draped in a Soviet flag. \"Somebody get a doctor!\" Rocky yelled frantically. \"Is he dead?\" asked one reporter. \"Get back! Give him some air!\" yelled Rocky. \"You're gonna be okay champ. Just hold on…hold on…\" Apollo's wife tried to get through but the mass of the media would not allow her to see her husband alive again. She did get to hear the voice of the man who killed him, however, since he was being interviewed. \"I cannot be defeated…I defeat all man…\" Drago said to the crowd. \"Creed is motionless! This is absolute pandemonium.\" Said one commenter. \"Soon…I defeat real champion…\" \"What started out as a joke has turned into a disaster!\" yelled one of the commenters. \"If he dies, he dies…\" Rocky looked at Apollo's head in his hands and then realized that his friend was dead. Dead. Gone. He was gone forever and never coming back. Then Rocky's gaze shifted. He looked into the big blue eyes of Ivan Drago… --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It was a bright and sunny day at the graveyard. Apollo's grave was covered in flowers, and his family and friends surrounded it. Rocky wore a dark suit with black sunglasses and yet somehow still felt cold under the heat of the sun. \"There's a lot I could say about this man. I don't know if it matters now…I guess what matters is what he lived for…and what he died for. We always did everything the way you wanted it,\" Rocky said as a tear began to stream down his cheek, \"I didn't understand that but…now I understand…we'll never forget you Apollo…\" Rocky then grabbed his title belt gently and placed it on the grave. Rocky had given the belt to Apollo, a real champion. \"You're the best,\" Rocky said as he slowly walked away from the grave with the others as the gold icon on the belt gleamed in the bright sun… \"Rocky, has a champion ever given up the title before?\" asked one reporter at the press conference. \"I don't know…\" Rocky replied faintly. There was going to be a lot of questions. Why didn't the boxing commission sanction the fight? Where was the fight going to be held? Does this mean war with the Soviets? \"With Rocky's known punching power, do you still think this is going to be an easy fight?\" asked a reporter. \"Yes of course. It is a matter of science. This man has neither the size nor the genetics to win. Drago is the most perfect human being ever created.\" Replied the premier. \"There's been no mention of this yet, but how much are you making for the fight?\" asked one reporter. \"No money.\" Replied Rocky. \"Has the fight date been set yet?\" \"December 25th.\" \"Why Christmas?\" \"That's what I was told.\" \"Where is the match taking place?\" \"Moscow.\" \"Are you nuts?!\" asked Maci who was sitting next to Rocky. \"Why did you agree to this?\" Cat asked. \"We fight in Soviet Union only! Tell them why, Ludmilla.\" The premier demanded. \"I fear for my husband's life. We receive threats of violence everywhere we go. You call him a killer but he is a professional sportsmen. You have this belief that you are so very good and we are so very bad. You have this belief that you are better than us.\" \"It is all just lies and propaganda used to support this violent and antagonistic government!\" yelled the premier. \"Whoa! Violent? We don't keep our people behind a wall with machine guns!\" yelled Maci. \"Who are you?\" asked the premier. \"I'm an average American citizen, that's who!\" yelled Maci, which got a laugh from the crowd. \"We've had enough! We go!\" yelled the premier as he got up from his seat and began to leave. While the crowd of reporters followed them and Rocky, Taarin was being followed by a media swarm. All of them were asking questions about Rocky and her going to Russia, which she had no idea about. She ran into her house and eventually the reporters left. Hours later in that same driveway, a DeLorean parked itself in the driveway. Out if it came Rocky who went inside his girlfriend's house to find her waiting for him. \"Rocky?\" \"Yeah?\" \"You alright?\" \"Alright.\" \"Why'd you do it?\" \"I just gotta do what I gotta do.\" \"You don't have to do anything.\" \"No Taarin, I do. And…I have to leave too…\" \"So…where are you going?\" \"They said they were going to let me train in Russia. I just want to go to a place where I won't think about anything but him.\" \"Rocky…give it some time. A lot of people deal with hurt.\" \"A lot of people don't have a choice but I do.\" \"So…you're willing to throw away everything? Before there were reasons I could understand but I can't understand this. Even if you win what have you won? Apollo's still gone…Why can't you change you're thinking? Everybody else does!\" \"Because I'm a fighter! We can't change what we are.\" \"Yes we can…\" \"No we can't change anything! We can only go with what we are.\" \"Have you read the papers?! You've seen how strong he is! It's suicide! You can't win!\" Suddenly it felt like Rocky's heart exploded. He looked at Taarin weakly and tried to talk. \"Taarin…Taarin always tells the truth. Maybe I can't win. Maybe all I can do is take everything he's got. But to beat me, he's going to have to kill me. And to kill me, he has to have the heart to stand and fight me. And to do that, he has to be willing to die himself.\" Rocky said as he slowly walked out the door. Rocky then entered his car and began to drive out in the streets. Although he was driving, his eyes could not see the road. He drove with his subconscious because his conscious mind saw Drago in fighting stance. His hair was down and he looked more raw and natural. More powerful than before. He was surround be darkness and he seemed to disappear in flashes like lightning bolts and re-appear just as quick. He came closer with each flash. We're not indestructible, baby better get that straight I think it's unbelievable how you give into the hands of fate Drago gave Apollo a punishing blow against the ropes. The fight was beginning to replay in Rocky's mind. He wiped away a tear as it continued. Some things are worth fighting for some feelings never die Rocky looked out the window. It was dark and damp to everybody else but he saw a bright and sunny beach. Apollo and him were racing. This time Rocky won and they celebrated with a victory hug. I'm not askin' for another chance I just wanna know why A scrambled montage of the fight and memories of Apollo began going through Rocky's mind. There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out Giving in can't be wrong Suddenly his thoughts began wander. He stopped thinking about Apollo and the fight and began thinking about good memories with his friends and Taarin. I don't wanna pasify you I don't wanna drag you down but I'm feelin like a prisoner like a stranger in a no named town I see all the angry faces afraid that could be you and me talkin about what might have been I'm thinkin about what I used to be Rocky thought about the fight between Taarin and him and tried to ignore those images in his head. He had to focus on Apollo and Drago. He could not get distracted. His mind began to play a jumble of memories, now just about Taarin and the fight. There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out Giving in can't be wrong The memories of Drago almost diminished entirely and the memories became of the good times with his friends. He remembered the time he sold Dinosaur capsules as drugs to get money for the site. He remembered when he cut off his hand to do his art homework. He remembered when John dressed up as Xy63r N1nja and had a hostile takeover. Baby,baby we can shed this skin we can know how we feel inside instead of goin' down and endless road not knowin if we're dead or alive But Some things are worth Fighting for Some feelings never die I'm not askin for another chance I just wanna know why Rocky used all of his will-power to end all of the happy thoughts. He now was focused on the blow that killed Apollo. As Apollo fell in his mind, he fell. He fell alongside Apollo as if they were one. Part of him died with Apollo. All tears he might have had in him turned to stone. He was going to be strong. The flashing Drago appeared in his mind again. His mind was now focused on the task at hand. There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out Giving in , giving in can't be wrong no There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy , no easy, no easy way out There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out Giving in , giving in can't be wrong no There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy , no easy, no easy way out There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out… \"There's no easy way out of this mess…\" BearFrog said angrily as he rubbed his hands together. \"Well, at least we have a fire.\" Turtle Man said happily. BearFrog looked down at the tiny spark Turtle Man called a fire. Suddenly, the wind blew it out. \"GAH!! How can it possibly get worse?!\" yelled BearFrog. \"Hello boys.\" Said Comrade Picard (using a megaphone), who was standing outside in the middle of a blizzard with about five hundred soldiers. \"D'oh!\" yelled Turtle Man and BearFrog at the same time. The two cold Americans exited the caves and stared at the miniature army. Then gave weak glances at each other and then BearFrog ripped off his shirt and put a belt of bullets over his chest. He then picked up a nearby machine gun which they had found out of in the cold. Turtle Man began to scream loudly. His eyes bulged as he scream and the earth beneath him shook. All of the soldiers felt this force and some of them walked backwards slightly and then ran. Without even looking, Comrade Picard shot all of them with his handgun. Turtle Man's muscles grew. His shirt was destroyed by the ki surrounding him (though his pants were fine). Suddenly his left arm became very big. He reached into it and pulled out a huge sword. The transformation was not done yet. His hair grew longer and his face suddenly had blue makeup on it. \"Let's get em.\" Said Turtle Man with an Irish accent. \" Attack! \" yelled Comrade Picard. The soldiers obeyed and ran towards BearFrog and Turtle Man in the cold snow. \"Freedom!\" yelled Turtle Man. Bullets were flying as BearFrog shot his gun. No soldiers were killed by BearFrog, but some of their guns were disabled, including Picard's. Turtle Man, however, just began hacking and slashing through the soldiers while BearFrog did his mercy shooting. \" Cease Fire! \" yelled Picard. He approached BearFrog and Turtle Man who have stopped attacking. \"You are quite impressive, American. What is your name?\" \"BearFrog.\" \"Ah, an alias. How nice. I am Comrade Picard.\" \"Comrade Picard…Hey! Aren't you that Russian former boxing champion?\" asked Turtle Man. \"Yes, I am. Now I am a commanding officer in the new Soviet Union. I would like to know where you got your abilities.\" \"Rocky taught every customer who bought a Bob shirt how to control ki energy and-\" Turtle Man began before BearFrog hit Turtle Man in the back of his neck and knocked him out. \"So where did Mr. Pinnicle learn how to use ki?\" BearFrog turned around, ignoring the question. He walked over to outside the cave and picked up his yellow jacket. He dusted off the snow and put it on as he walked back toward Picard and picked up Turtle Man. \"I'm not telling you anything. I have enough ki to fly to Japan and I'm leaving so if you'll excuse me…\" said BearFrog as he tried to walk around, but the Soviet stepped in front of him. \"I shall let you pass if you can defeat me in combat.\" \"Well, a fight sounds like fun,\" said BearFrog as he made a fire using ki and placed TM next to it, \"Alright, bring it.\" The Russian began to power up like they did previously. His muscles bulged and his shirt ripped off in the process, showing a surprisingly powerful figure. \"Oh .\" POW! BearFrog took a punch right to the kisser. He spun around before hit the ground. Picard tried to lift up BearFrog by his legs, but BearFrog kicked Picard in the gut to counter. Kick! Block! Punch! Block! Each move they tried on each other the other blocked. Some soldiers took out their guns but the captain told them to stand down. The two entered a grapple, with neither budging and inch. Then BearFrog got a smart idea. He kicked Picard in the place where families are made. Picard jumped back in pain, and BearFrog then began his assault on Picard. All of his blows damaging, all of them full of ki. With one final kick, Picard was launched back twenty feet into the snow. \"Impressive…\"said Picard as he pushed himself up. \"But let us see how you face our new secret weapon… Come out Rocky Statue!\" A small gray box that a soldier was holding was set on the ground. Suddenly it began to grow, with a form shaping as it grew. Then the look-alike of Rocky Pinnicle stood before everyone. It slowly walked towards BearFrog. BearFrog grinned and charged toward it. BAM! A powerful punch to the head! The statue had attacked BearFrog so fast he didn't even see it. He shook off his headache and gave a very powerful punch to the statue's chest, The statue simply stood motionless, as did BearFrog. They stood in that position. BearFrog began to walk back in fear and then faced another punch, this time to the gut. \"Gah…what am I gonna do?\" BearFrog asked himself as he fell next to TM. Suddenly he heard something that nobody else seemed to notice. He gave a wide grin and then got up smirking. He put Turtle Man over his shoulder's and then gave a finger gesture to all of the Russians. ZOOM! A plane appeared overhead. BearFrog flew up to it as fast as he could and punched a hole in the plane. He arrived in the cargo area and gave a sigh of relief as he flew away from his Russian rivals. Now they could get some warmth and relax as they flew… \" They got away! Now how are we supposed to find out how they gained ki knowledge! \" \"Ahem!\" said a voice. \" You! \" yelled Picard. \"Yes, me. I was the private hacker you hired.\" Said Dingus with a smirk. \"Yes…we destroyed your computer, Mr. Dinguson.\" \"Yes, but I myself have ki knowledge because I stalked Rocky and learned from him teaching others. We have a long standing rivalry between us. As does my friend here…\" said Dingus as he extended an arm. Behind him was a stranger in a cloak. He threw it off to reveal Kermit The Frog! The statue walked towards them but Picard put his arm in front of the statue, who stopped. \"Mr. Picard, contact your premier. I think we can work to reach both of our goals…\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ZOOM! The plane was about to land. The place was surrounded with soldiers, staring at the plane without any emotion at all. Two worlds collide Rival nations It's a primitive clash Venting years of frustrations. Bravely we hope Against all hope There is so much at stake Seems our freedom's up Against the ropes… Does the crowd understand? Is it East versus West Or man against man Can any nation stand alone? Two Russian eagerly await the Americans to exit the plane. They sit still in a car, as another Russian waits outside of it. He is wearing a suit similar to that a detective would wear in old movies, complete with hat but he had a funny mustache to go with the look. In front of him was another car which looked just like the one he was leaning on. The plane door opened and the door, which had steps on it touched the ground. Bob stepped out, fully covered with winter clothing. In the burning Heart Just about to burst There's a quest for answers An unquenchable thirst In the darkest night Rising like a spire In the burning heart The unmistakable fire \"What an awful flight over here. So this is Russia? Don't look so tough, eh Rock?\" said Bob as she stepped off the plane. Tony Duke then stepped out of the plane and looked up to see the Soviet flag waving. The flag seemed so…evil…so…powerful… It gave him chills, which made the freezing cold Siberia much more cold. The others exited and felt the same chills, though not on the level Tony felt them. Then Rocky exited. He looked around the fort and saw that all the soldiers were looking at him. He got off the plane and the two cars approached. The mustached man exited the car and approached Rocky. \"Mr. Pinnicle, Drasvitiah. We take you to quarters now. Please enter car.\" Said the man with a powerful Russian accent. \"Hey when does the sun come up? This is bad for my sinuses.\" Said John. \"The weather changes from hour to hour. Get used to it. Get in car now, we have very long trip.\" \"Are we all going to fit?\" asked Cat as they walked towards the cars. \"If we don't Bob gets to go because the other people are more stupid than Bob…stupid.\" BearFrog (who had been sleeping) just woke up. He thought he heard Bob's voice. He jumped out of the plane with TM and saw them entering the cars. BearFrog decided he would fly above them as they traveled so he could see what was going on because he didn't want to risk causing a scene. He was, however, cold. So was TM (presumably) so BearFrog \"borrowed\" a few uniforms from soldiers who were suddenly \"tied up\". In the warriors code There's no surrender Though his body says stop His spirit cries - never! Deep in our soul A quiet ember Know it's you against you It's the paradox That drives us on The cars arrived in a snowy village in which the snow was three feet high. The cars stopped in front of an old house that had a man standing on the porch with a block of wood. He lived in the house and \"volunteered\" to have the Americans stay there as guests. BearFrog decided to land behind the house and he then snuck up to the side so he could hear what they were saying. It's a battle of wills In the heat of attack It's the passion that kills The victory is yours alone In the burning Heart Just about to burst There's a quest for answers An unquenchable thirst In the darkest night Rising like a spire In the burning heart The unmistakable fire Everyone got out of the cars except for the two Russian men who were in the cars earlier. \"Like you request, yes?\" asked the mustached man. \"You requested this dump?\" asked Bob. \"Yeah.\" Replied Rocky. \"Why? Are you planning to grow some reindeer?\" \"I just want to get away from everything.\" \"Then why'd you bring us along?\" \"Moral support during the match.\" \"The equipment you requested is in there.\" Said the mustached man as he pointed to an ice covered barn. \"Who are they?\" Rocky asked as he pointed at the two Russians in the car. \"They are official chaperones. They go where you go.\" \"This is below human standard. Not even the U.S. is this bad.\" Maci commented. \"You gotta complain Rocky! There's no internet here! We'll crack out here!\" John said in a panicked voice. \"You mean YOU'LL crack out here.\" Said James with his arms folded. \"Shaaaaa…\" \"Does he ever have any other dialogue in a BearFrog fanfic?\" asked Cat. \"You have everything I have been instructed to provide. Das Vidanyah.\" Said the mustached man as he entered the car and then drove off. \"Well, ready to do some sparring?\" asked John. \"I don't think I need it anymore, John.\" Replied Rocky. \"No sparring, no t.v., no squirrelies to kill…what a depressing vacation.\" Said Bob as she hoped on top of the snow and began to walk around when suddenly it caved in under her and she screamed \"WOOOAAHH!\" Boot was kind enough to pick up Bob and then hold the cat in his arms as they followed the others into the house. \"What am I gonna do? Somebody has to watch the forums! The place won't last if I'm not there for a long period of time!\" \" Don't worry, \" Boot began, \" I left somebody in charge who is very similar to you. \" \"Phew! That's a relief! Thanks Boot! I hope whoever you got can last while I make a laptop. I can't believe I forgot it again!\" said John as he walked off. \"So…who'd you get?\" asked Cat. \" John's clone. \" Elsewhere in America, John's clone is typing on the forums using John's account. \"htat is stupid you is banned now1\" Elsewhere in the same country, I:h:e:a:r:t:b:o:b is wondering why he just got banned from NC forums. Now let's turn our attention back to Russia. It is now nighttime. BearFrog and Turtle Man are hiding in a closet, waiting for a chance to talk to Rocky or somebody alone. Bob slept soundly by the fireplace while Cat listened to an Alvin & The Chipmunks C.D. Chad was sleeping, John was making a laptop out of wood, Boot was resting, James was eating a live pig, P.J. was roasting marshmallows by the fire, and Maci was watching Tony play chess with their Russian host. \"Check-mate my friend.\" Tony said. The Russian knocked over the white king and then Tony headed upstairs where Rocky was unpacking. He was setting up photos in the mirror like he had at home, surrounded by pictures of good times with his friends. One photo, however, was of an enemy. He put up a black and white newspaper clipping of Ivan Drago up on the mirror. Knock, Knock, Knock. \"Hey champ. Can I come up?\" asked Tony. \"Yeah sure.\" Replied Rocky. Tony walked up the stairs and entered the room. \"How are you doing?\" asked Tony. \"Pretty good.\" \"Some kind of weather we're having up here, huh?\" \"Yeah, it's pretty rough.\" \"To prep for what you gotta do it's good. Toughen you up.\" Said Tony with a smile. His tone changed suddenly. \"I know you're going to have to do almost everything alone up here, but you know I'll be with you.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"Apollo was like my son…I raised him. And when he died…part of me died…\" \"Apollo's dead?!\" BearFrog thought to himself as he waited in the closet for the best moment to exit. \"But now…you're the one…You're the one that's gonna keep his spirit alive…You're the one that's gonna make sure he didn't die for nothin'. Now you're going to have to go through hell. Worse than any nightmare you ever dreamed…but in the end…I know you'll be the last one standing.\" \"Thanks Tony.\" Said Rocky as they gave each other a hug. \"I'll try…\" Tony left the hug. \"You know what you've got to do. Do It. Do It…\" Tony then went downstairs. Rocky was unpacking his clothes when BearFrog fell out of the closet, in the Russian uniform covered by his yellow jacket. \"Hey Rocky. What's up?\" BearFrog asked. \"Why are you in a Siberian house closet wearing Russian uniforms with Turtle Man?\" asked Rocky. \"You know that's a good question. It's a long story and-\" \"Hey Rocky, we're out of marshmallows and…hey BearFrog. What's up?\" asked P.J. \"We-\" \"Hey guys!\" yelled P.J. \"BearFrog and Turtle Man are here!\" Suddenly everybody arrived upstairs, including the Russian man. \"You are friends with Soviet soldiers?\" asked the Russian. \"Uhh…yeah. Hey, could you please leave the room. We need to talk to them.\" Said John. \"Sure.\" Said the Russian man as he headed downstairs and closed the door. He then put his head next to it. \"In the U.S.S.R., they encourage people to spy on their neighbor and I doubt they would discourage spying on Americans.\" John told the group. \"Just like America.\" Maci commented. \"So what have you two been up to?\" asked Cat. \"That's what I asked them when I found them in the closet.\" Rocky told the group. \"Hey, isn't that illegal?\" \"No, MARRIAGE is illegal and that's in the U.S. I'm not sure about the Soviet's policy on the issue but they're too busy killing their own citizens.\" John told the group. \"Just like America.\" Maci chimed in. \"Hey, at least we're doing something about it unlike the Soviets! Show some patriotism Maci!\" \"I do have American pride, just not in the current America.\" \"At least Bush is trying to improve the nation!\" \"I really hope he loses in the election. I think it's tonight, right?\" \"Yes it is and I hope he wins. That way he'll save the lives of all the unborn babies.\" \"Yes, and kill the innocent people on death row and put our country into utter turmoil.\" \"Whoa, guys! Easy on the politics! We don't want BearFrog to start his sarcastic political humor.\" Said Bob. \"Shaaaaa….\" Said Chad. \"I agree. And get better dialogue.\" Said Cat. \"Oh man, I hate that.\" Said P.J. \"Too evil for me.\" Said James. \"Alright! BearFrog, give us the 411 on what's going on here.\" Rocky ordered BearFrog. \"Well, it all started when I took a trip to China…\" While BearFrog told his comrades about his adventures, the enemies of Rocky were sitting down with the premier, who had a gigantic glass window behind him. On the other side was an indoor track where Ivan was running laps. \"Why would I let you attack Rocky Pinnicle? He will be fighting in an important match against Ivan.\" The premier told them. \"Mr. Kotoff, you want to learn if the legends are true, yes? Rocky Pinnicle is the key. If we figure out how he learned to use his ki..nehahaha…ki…key…get it? Nyahahaha…Anyway, we just want to kill Rocky. We can get the info out of him and then dress up stoney here to look like Rocky.\" Said Kermit as he pointed at the statue. \"He has a good point sir. We did steal it for situations like that and this could make the fight much easier.\" Picard told his premier. \"Yes, but you should keep Drago training because failure is very possible, especially with all of his friends around.\" Dingus commented. \"You will not fail, but we shall push Drago to the limit because the statue might attack and his strength increases every day. But do not worry, the Soviet Union will make sure that you do not fail. Gentlemen, follow me.\" Said the premier as he got up. \" Sir! \" yelled one soviet soldier as he entered the room. \" We found the Americans! They are with Pinnicle and his comrades! \" \" Even more reason to attack them! We have to kill them before our secrets are let out! They have probably told the Pinnicle team so we must get them! \" yelled Picard angrily, who wanted to kill BearFrog. \" Yes, I agree! To the labs! \" yelled Kotoff, Ruler of The Soviet Union. Now it is time to once again shift our focus elsewhere. We return to the upper room of the Siberian home in which BearFrog was telling the story. \"So you dressed up like Rambo and Braveheart?\" asked John. \"Yes we did, Johnny.\" Said BearFrog in a voice imitating the colonel from Rambo. \"It really made sense at the time but I later realized that it was Siberia and very, very cold. That's why we took the uniforms after we got off the plane and also to try to look less suspicious.\" \"That would be a good plan had you not had the yellow jacket on over the uniform.\" Maci said. \"Dude…Aside from my Bob shirt, which is very comfortable and sold at a great price, it is the only piece of awesomely cool clothing I own!\" \"Why not buy more Bob shirts?\" suggested Bob. \"Hey, that's a great idea. In fact, I think I'll get some other great an inexpensive Neptune Circle merchandise too!\" said BearFrog as he turned and winked at nobody. \"Guys, this is all very interesting but I have to get up early and train so…\" Rocky began. \"Alright, we got it. You have to train so you can kick some commie butt!\" BearFrog yelled excitedly. \"BearFrog, kindly shut up.\" Bob said to BearFrog. BearFrog did. He realized that Rocky had to do this alone, without joy. He had to go through the most difficult training of his life for his most difficult fight. The group went downstairs and got themselves settled in and gave a brief excuse to the Russian man (very brief as BearFrog knew little of the language) and they all went to sleep (except for Turtle Man who was still knocked out). The group left Rocky alone in the room to gather his thoughts once more and to prepare for training. He looked down at the newspaper clipping intensely for a long time before finally going to bed. He got up with the sun the next day… It was a cold morning in Siberia, as most Siberian mornings are, but this morning was calm and cool. There was no wind, simply the utter silence of nature. Rocky got up right away, in his mountain training gear and looked out to see his Russian chaperones. Rocky walked across the snow yard and began jogging in the street with the Russians following behind by car. As he ran the neighbors watched him: an old man and his wife, a young child and his mother, and their spy of a host who reported the incident involving BearFrog to the government. Rocky, however, was just there to train. He ran along the street, almost causing a carriage to crash, but jogged swiftly enough to avoid an accident. The two Russians spied on Rocky with their binoculars to see what this \"special training\" would be. Machines everywhere were monitoring Ivan Drago's performance. He was on a machine that simulated climbing, and it was quite similar to a treadmill. This, however, was much more intense. He had to climb with his arms too, or nothing would happen. He had been doing this exercise for hours and was getting quite sweaty. As he did that, Rocky was running up the slopes of steep, snowy hills. He too had been running for hours, but had not the convenience of a warm room. Rocky ran across the small and freezing cold creek, and some of the painful water splashed onto his legs. But he kept on running, as did Drago. In their training headquarters there was an area where Drago would run laps on a mat-like setting. As he wore the tight white suit, he punched the speed bag when he passed each time, marking a new lap. Rocky didn't punch the air at the end of a lap, he just simply kept running up the stream (in it still, I might add). He wanted to reach the end of the stream and see what was there. Ivan moved his thick legs up and down and up and down in rhythmic fashion, as he did with moving his arms from in to out. It was a need training style that the scientists concluded would produce highly impressive results. Taking the advice of the scientists, Kotoff forced Drago to take this intense training as his lovely wife watched. Whilst Drago did that, Rocky was busy helping the man in the carriage, who had gotten stuck later. Rocky helped him get the carriage out of the snow and then continued on with his training of running in the freezing cold. Speed is important. That was surely known in the room with red lighting as Ivan was spinning the wheel with the poles extending out of it. Ivan turned this instrument as opposed to the speed-bag Rocky was using because this instrument could measure his speed, and also increase other muscle areas that speed-bag training does not usually result in. Bam! Rocky smashed the speed-bag flat with a furious final punch before moving onto his next part of training: Every-day life. In Siberia, it's cold all the time. Rocky went outside during a snow storm to chop wood for his friends inside the cabin. It was hard moving the saw back and forth on the large log with the strong winds, but he did it. He did it with the Russians watching. Russians were watching Ivan too. Slowly the large barbells he was lifting got larger. More weight was added on. As was true with Rocky as he threw logs into the wheel-barrow. The logs were getting harder and harder to move, as was the same for Drago lifting the weights. Clarance sat on the sled in the freezing cold snow-storm as Rocky got down on his hands and knees and tried moving the sled forward, giving it all he had. Drago did a similar exercise, only he was pulling nothing. He was just moving his arms and legs back and forth on a machine that did the same exercise. Both men struggled to push forward, but they did. They did not stop. Rocky was doing pull-ups in the barn. Now with his jacket off and white muscle-shirt on, he pulled himself up the hanging log that was on a fairly loose piece of rope. It rotated slowly as Rocky did this exercise and made it all the more difficult. Tony, John and BearFrog watched in awe as Rocky kept up his training. After that, at nightfall, he went outside (in his full winter clothing) and punched at the air and then picked up and large log and put it behind his shoulders. He then began to walk in the deep snow, carrying his cross. Bam! Drago smashed his sparring partner with a punch! Chink! Rocky hit the axe against the tree to chop down wood! Bam! Chink! Bam! Chink! Bam! Chink! Tiiiiimmbeerr!! Both the tree and the sparring partner fell to the ground, accepting defeat. After that, Rocky went back to his jogging. When he got back to the cabin a surprise awaited him. Taarin. \"I couldn't stay away anymore…I missed you.\" Said Taarin softly. \"I missed you.\" Replied Rocky. \"I'm with you, no matter what.\" \"No matter what.\" \"No matter what…\" Rocky and Taarin gave one-another a heart-felt kiss in the freezing cold, and thus did their lips stick together for quite some time (though not due to the cold.) Bang! This was just what Rocky needed. His beard had become messy, his body stronger. But his heart…his heart had weakened. And Taarin healed it. Back in the shed he was training again, this time with jump ropes. He began to swing so fast you wouldn't see his feet even touch the ground. Then after a steady pace of that he finished up with a speedy series of jumps that made dust fly straight out of the holes in the barn and straight into the neighboring houses. Silence in the darkness creeps into your soul Envy moves the light of self control The gate that holds you captive has the door Burnin' with determination to even up the score Sit ups had apparently gotten boring, so Rocky did something called \"air ups\". John would hold Rocky's feet down from the balcony in the barn, and Rocky would do sit ups, and punch the air at the top of them. Drago pushed himself up and down inside a machine that simulated the same workout, but Rocky's extent was just plain crazy. The results were showing as Rocky chopped wood with John. Each wood block was cut with incredible precision and power. Before it was normal wood chopping, but now it seemed as if some powerful force was destroying a castle wall. Drago then began to ease up on training while Rocky tied up a bunch of large Rocky's in a net and then lifted them using pulleys by turning his back and pulling. The pain was almost nigh impossible to endure, and his back ached, yet his iron will would not be broken. His heart was raging deep within his soul, and it was on fire… Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high The moment of truth draws near More new training for Rocky was done. He would lie on a table and then lift up his entire body like sit-ups, but always keep his arms on the sides of the table in that same bent position. \"Come on, Rocky. No pain.\" Said Tony. 3580psi That's what the monitor said after Drago hit the punching machine. 4700psi 6000psi Bam! Another punch from Drago and the machine broke down, shocking the audience watching. Time will not allow you to stay still, no Silence breaks the heart and bends the will Defense is guilty passions out of control Rules and regulations have no meaning any more Drago received his daily shot of yellow liquid. In the tube, a combination of Ki science and anabolic steroids. His strength was almost doubled each time he took one of those shots, and it was soon thought that if he were to get any stronger, the world would be unable to handle such a behemoth. Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high The moment of truth is here Rocky was in his room, looking at all the photographs. Then the photograph of Drago caught his eye, and he grabbed and crushed it in one motion. He then tossed the paper into the garbage and went outside to go back to training. Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Fever's risin', energizin', right up to till end All of his friends were in the large wooden wheel-barrel type device. Rocky then grabbed the ends that a hose would normally grab and began lifting up the heavy thing very slowly. At this point Rocky was extremely buffed up, more muscular than he had ever been before in his life. Drago was lifting the heaviest weight he had ever lifted in his life. He pushed with all his might as the crowd watched with anticipation. Both of them raised their weights into the air. But Drago dropped his almost instantly. \"DRAGO!!\" Rocky yelled as he kept his comrades in air/ Heart's on fire Strong desire Rages deep within Fever's risin' Energizin' Right up till the end Heart's on fire Strong desire… Raging in till the end… Rocky was back to running and Drago was on a treadmill. Rocky began to run extremely fast up and loose his Russian guards while the trainers in Drago's camp pushed a button that slowly made the treadmill stepper, life a cliff. Both struggled to keep moving, to go the distance. But Drago feel. Rocky kept on running up the mountain, up to it's pinnacle. He climbed and grabbed until he reached the peak and screamed out his opponent's name. \"DRAGOOOO!!! DRAGOOOO!! DRAGOOOO!!\" yelled Rocky with his arms extended. It was the night before the fight. The sun was beginning to set over this part of Russia, and Rocky's group had to catch their flight to Moscow. They were all packed and ready to go. Rocky had even shaved and got his regular appearance back. But before they could leave, their host stopped them. \"Mr. Pinnicle, wait! I have something for you!\" he said with a thick Russian accent. Rocky looked puzzled as he was handed a small orange orb. \"It is my most prized possession, and I give it to you: for good luck.\" \"Gee, thanks. But really, you didn't have to give me this…\" began Rocky. \"No, I had to atone. I had spied on you and reported you to the government, and you are in fact and kind and great man. Please, forgive me.\" \"Hey, no harm no fo-\" BLAM!! The cabin blew up. The large group turned in front of them quickly after the explosion (and falling face first into the snow), and saw Kermit standing in front of them. Only Kermit was different. He had huge muscles and was gigantic, like a wrestler, but bigger. Still, he had the guns in his arms. And next to him was Dingus, wearing a Soviet soldier outfit. \"Kermit!!\" yelled Rocky in anger. \"Hi-ho, hi-ho!\" yelled the frog. \"It's time for you to die, Rocky Pinnicle!\" yelled Dingus angrily. \"I've got a flight to catch,\" he replied calmly. \"Sorry, but your flight has been CANCELLED!!\" yelled Kermit as he and Dingus charged towards Rocky. Closing his eyes calmly, Rocky jumped up in the air in the right time and moved his body the right way (it was very quick and none of us saw), and when he landed, he stood in the wind like a stationary stone. Soon after, Kermit and Dingus, who had stopped moving completely, fell to the ground. \"Bravo, Comrade Pinnicle,\" said Picard as he clapped his hands, walking towards Rocky. \"And just who are you?\" said Rocky, who was facing the other way. \"He's Comrade Picard of the Soviet Army. He's pretty tough Rocky!\" yelled Turtle-Man. \"So are you here to escort me to the airport?\" asked Rocky. \"Far from it.\" Said Picard as he suddenly appeared right in front of Rocky and threw a punch at his face. Rocky did not move, because the punch did not hit his face. Picard simply held his fist in front of Rocky's face. \"Impressive,\" Picard laughed. The general threw off his vest to reveal the powerful figure underneath it and got into fighting stance. \"Now, Mr. Pinnicle, prepare to me-\" Bam! Boom! Pow! Boom! Rocky unleashed a quick series of powerful blows on Picard, who stumbled backward in pain, clutching his gut. Blood coughed out of his mouth in surprise. It blew his mind that anyone was this much more powerful than him. \"He….heh….Very impressive. But let me ask you this Rocky: Can you beat yourself?\" asked Picard. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Heh…Come out: Rocky Statue!!\" Out of the snow a figure jump into the air and landed solidly in front of Rocky. It was that statue in Boston, but somehow it had come to life and was staring down at Rocky. \"Now…Attack!!!\" yelled Picard. The statue obeyed and threw an incredibly fast punch at Rocky, which he ducked under and countered with an uppercut. The statue felt no pain and simply turned it's head back down to face Rocky and quickly gave him a punch to head. Rocky zoomed backwards at the attack but stopped himself in mid-air and then charged back forward towards the statue. When he got there, however, he couldn't see the statue anywhere. \"He's in the snow!!\" yelled Bob. Rocky moved his eyes around shiftily as sweat fell from his brow. He would have to rely on all of his sense other than Ki to detect this monster. Suddenly, a tiny sound was heard in the snow. Rocky quickly turned and kicked the statue that was standing behind him, but to no avail. The beast still unleashed and overhead smash to Rocky's head. After pulling himself from the ground, he got an idea. \"Fire Starter!\" yelled Rocky as he threw two small energy boomerangs from his hands. They hit the powerful state, but did not explode. Part of them were inside the statue while the other part was still hanging outside in the air. \"Good, it works.\" Rokcy said to himself. \"What are you doing stupid?! Throw bigger ones!!\" yelled Bob. While dodging the statue's attacks Rocky threw more and more Fire Starters at it until eventually the statue's entire body was covered in them. He smirked as he saw the glowing monster head towards him and then he raised a ki filled hand up the air. Then all of the Fire Starters got bigger…and bigger. Soon you couldn't even see the staue, though he was still attacking. \"I think that oughta do it.\" Said Rocky as he clenched his fist. BOOM!! The giant explosion made the night sky as bright as daylight. All of the people there closed their eyes but Turtle-Man, who had brought along sunglasses. After the light and dust cleared, a clear winner was shown. Rocky stood over the remains of the statue and looked at Picard intently. Picard then ran away like a little girl. \"Well, let's get going. We'll be late for our flight,\" Rocky said to his friends. \"And your fight.\" Said P.J. \"Hello everyone, merry Christmas. We're in Moscow in the Soviet Union in which we will see probably the most watched sporting event in all of history. The Mountain Peak, Rocky Pinnicle, facing off against Ivan Drago, whose nickname has changed since that tragedy in Las Vegas to 'Death from Above'. \" said the American commentator. Backstage, Rocky was getting the tape wrapped around his hands. The other were looking at the two Soviet guards watching them through a glass window, but Rocky's mind was elsewhere. He punched his gloves together and they made sounds more powerful than the crowd that was chanting his opponent's name… While Maci walked around back and forth (cloaked in an American flag), Rocky began to pray in his little corner of the room. This day, this most sacred of days, would be the day he fought the most evil of evils. Two thousand and four years ago a little baby was born, and that little baby changed human history forever. Rocky wasn't here to change history. He was just there to prevail. He was just there to topple the evils of the world and show that good guys can still win. He was there to help finish Apollo's dream of beating ithem/i once and for all. \"Rocky, I know you and I have had some bad times in the past…\" began Turtle-Man as he, Rocky, Bob, Maci and Tony walked out of the locker room. \"But you've always been there for me when I needed help, even when I was acting all stupid and crazy. And, I don't usually express feelings too well, but…If I could jump out of my skin and be anybody I wanted to, it'd be you…\" he said with tears in his eyes. \"Thanks, TM.\" Said Rocky as he hugged Turtle-Man. \"Now knock this guy's teeth out!\" yelled Turtle-Man as he headed for the seating area, followed by two guards, Rocky and company moved towards the steel-gate door and it was opened for them by a Soviet guard standing by. As they entered the arena, Rocky's white robe gleamed in the light. His friends looked up to see all of the booing Russians who were proudly waving their U.S.S.R. flags. \"Man, listen to this crowd! We knew he wouldn't be popular, but this is based on pure hatred!\" yelled one commentator as Rocky walked towards the ring. Nicoli Kotoff smiled as he watched Pinnicle get booed by so many people: a crowd reaction he was not used to. \"But man, this guys is rock solid! The booing crowd does not seem to bother him one bit.\" Said the commentator as Rocky looked up at where all the government officials were sitting. He then turned his head back towards the ring. \"He's a picture of concentration. The champ has a look tonight that could burn through lead. Rocky entered the ring and looked out to see the entrance of the Russian National Champion. The lights dimmed and Drago jogged towards the ring, following the two men carrying torches. The smoke had spread and the man entered the ring and went to his corner, which had an entire empire backing it. All the time he was out there Drago and Rocky stared at one another until Drago looked toward Kotoff and nodded, who then did the same. \"I would like to point out that this is a non-sanctioned match. It is not for the title. The American Boxing Commission has not sanctioned this fight. This is not for the title,\" Said one British commentator. Both men removed their robes. Both of them wearing trunks that represented their nation, but one of the trunks had a story. One of them belonged to one of the greatest fighters of all time, who could never fight again. One of them had sweat and blood in them. One of them did not. As Drago removed his robe he got a standing ovation. Then, after both robes were removed, music started playing. The entire crowd turned to salute the Soviet flag as the Soviet nation anthem played. A gigantic flag-like backdrop was raised from the back and on the flag was none other than Ivan Drago and the hammer and sickle. That symbol used to represent a government that was for the people. Now it was as tainted as a swastika. After the music stopped the lighting in the room became brighter once again. Rocky and Drago remained the same. They had been staring at each other ever since Drago entered the ring. The bad blood could be cut with a knife. \"Ladies and Gentman! \"yelled the announcer, who was in the center of ring. He began speaking in Russian, introducing Rocky. The crowd jeered. \"Never in my life have I seen such a hostile crowd,\" Said the British man. Then he introduced Drago. The crowd cheered. Rocky and Drago met one another in the center of the ring. They looked deep into each other's eyes, totally ignoring everything the Russian ref was saying. They just looked at each other for the longest time, with Drago towering over Rocky. Drago was the only one of them to speak up there. \"I must break you.\" Smash! Drago hit Rocky's gloves down forcefully. After his little show of his new power, Drago headed to his corner, as did Rocky. \"Hey Rocky, remember what I said about wanting to be you?\" asked Turtle-Man. \"Yeah?\" \"Forget it.\" Rocky turned to face Drago, who was in his corner and replied \"Thanks, TM.\" Rocky then knelt back down in his corner to pray again while Drago danced a bit in his corner. After praying Rocky got some advice from Tony. \"Take it to him, Rock! Be a rock fighter! Be a rock fighter! No pain!\" yelled Tony. \"No pain.\" Replied Rocky. \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"Alright, go do it!!\" yelled Tony. Ding! Ding! Rocky and Drago met each other in the center of the ring, but Drago had much longer arms and got the first punch. Bam! A right to the head. Drago slowly moved Rocky into his own corner with one-two combos to the chest and head, occasionally taking the time to do an extra punch in one of the two areas. Rocky was taking some serious punishment from Drago until he grabbed the ropes and swung around them just like Rey Mysterio and landed right behind Drago. In the center of the ring Drago once again was giving Rocky long blows to the head. Rocky tried to get in to punch Drago, but he couldn't get past his long reaching arms. Then, quickly and masterfully, Rocky charged Drago and shoved him up against the ropes. Bam! Bam! Bam! Rocky pounded away at Drago's mid-section. Zoom! Drago pushed Rocky into the center of the ring and smiled widely, showing Rocky his black mouth-guard. Rocky ran back against the ropes and continued pounding at Drago's mid-section but then the swooped around and it was Drago who was pounding away at Rocky's head. They began to move around the ring as they fought, giving Rocky more opportunity. He tried for a leaping punch with his right, but he missed and got another hard blow from Drago. Drago grabbed Rocky and held him up by the neck and began to pound away at his head. The crowd cheered as he tossed Rocky to the ground hard, causing a cut to appear in the corner of Rocky's head. The ref began to count. Rocky had already fallen to the ground in Round 1. Rocky managed to shake it off and get up quickly. Drago was waiting near him and then went back to smashing Rocky's body with his Soviet super punches. He was beating up Rocky in Rocky's corner, with his friends getting a close up view of their friend's battle. Ding! Ding! The round had ended, but Rocky held onto Drago and charge him forward. Drago stopped them in the middle of the ring and shoved Rocky back into his own corner like a rag-doll. It had not been a great start. \"Things aren't looking so good for Rocky Pinnicle. Not only is fighting a seemingly invincibly opponent, he is also fighting a very hostile crowd and the Soviet government officials looking on,\" said one America commentator. \"This is all the Democratic party's fault!\" yelled the other American commentator, who happened to be Rush Limbaugh. \"If they hadn't supported of great president more then the Soviet Union wouldn't have risen again! Them and there talk of 'equal rights' and 'helping the homeless' and 'caring about other people'…Now we have to watch our good home boys get beat up by those damn ruskies!\" \"Should you really be saying that in the Soviet Union?\" asked his colleague. \"Ha! What are those stupid ruskies going to do-\" Zap! A Soviet soldier zapped Rush with a tazer and dragged him out of the arena, into prison. \"Alright, what's happening out there?\" asked Tony as he took a cotton ball and bobbed it against Rocky's bloody head. \"He's winning…I see three of him out there…\" replied Rocky. \"Hit the one in the middle,\" Suggested Bob. \"Right! Hit the one in the middle,\" repeated Tony. \" You're not doing as you are told! The American is small and weak…weak. \" said Drago's trainer as Drago took a drink of water. \"No pain!!\" yelled Tony. \"No pain!\" yelled Rocky. \"Take his heart!!\" \"Take his heart!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" Ding Ding! Round 2 began. Rocky and Drago moved toward the center of the ring, and once again Drago's long punches hit Rocky. But this time, Rocky ducked under some of them. He was also circling Drago and managed to stay in the center of the ring. \"Rocky Pinnicle has taken Drago's best punches so far! He's cut and he's bleeding but he's on his feet!\" Rocky made a leaping punch but missed, and then felt Drago give him a powerful blow to the head. Bam! Another leaping punch, but this one made contact. Drago grabbed Rocky and threw him to the ground hard. Rocky quickly got up and got Drago in the gut once before Drago unleashed a one-two combo on his head and he fell again. He quickly got up again, only to take more one-twos from Drago. \"He's getting killed out there!\" yelled Maci. Bam! Bam! Bam! More pain was found in Rocky's body every second he was out there. Drago's blows were incredibly painful. Rocky was now up against his corner, taking blows from Drago. The two swung around, but only for Drago to punch Rocky in the gut and sending him to the opposite corner. But Rocky was ready. He landed on the side of the corner and then pushed himself forward, charging for Drago at a high speed. Filling his punch with ki, he unleashed a furious blow to Drago's head, giving him a deep cut. \"The Russians cut! And it's a bad cut!!\" yelled one commentator. Now it was Rocky coming after Drago. Rocky was punishing Drago for his sins as Drago retreated backwards. Drago was now feeling true pain. Bam! A powerful punch by Rocky sent Drago into a nearby corner, greatly injuring his back. Rocky pounded away at the stalled Drago, but Drago threw enough punches to get out of the corner and back into the center of the ring. Back in the center of the ring, Rocky once again charged like a bull and shoved Drago against the ropes, and then began beating on the larger man. He would not stop unleashing powerful blows to Drago's head. Even when the bell rang and the ref pulled at him he would not stop. Drago grabbed Rocky by the throat and punched him in the head. Rocky, in turn, picked up Drago and threw him to the ground with Rocky on top of him. Rocky punched at the laying Drago and had to be pulled off by the ref and his team-mates. \"It's a gutter war! No holds barred in Moscow!! Rocky may be on the receiving end so far, but he's here to fight! This is shaping up to be a personal war and right now it's anybody's boxing match!!\" \"You're doing good Rocko. I couldn't have done better myself.\" Said Bob. \"Thanks, Bobbie.\" Replied Rocky as he sat down on his stool. \" How can you do this? He's nothing! Soft! \" yelled Drago's trainer. \"You got him hurt bad. No he's worried. You cut him! You hurt him! See?! He's not a machine! He's a man!\" yelled Tony. \" He is not human…he's like a piece of iron. \" Drago said as he got up. \"You want it more than he does! No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"Okay, take it to him!!\" Ding! Round 3 began with Drago taking charge, but Rocky was blocking the blows well. He was circling his arms like a man rowing a kayak, blocking all blows Drago was giving him. Bam Bam! Rocky took two punches to his head. Bam Bam! Drago took two punches to his head. Rocky went for a ki filled punch but Drago blocked it with a small energy blast that dazzled the audience. Rocky didn't stop though. He gave Drago a powerful key filled uppercut to the jaw, and the bell rang as Drago stumbled backwards slightly. In his corner Drago smacked away his helper who was only trying to give him some water. Round 4 was Drago's round. He was pounding on Rocky that entire round, never letting up at one moment. Rocky got a few hits in, but Drago was the dominating force. The punches were all glowing with power, and some of the glowing power was left on Rocky's cheeks as he stumbled into his corner. Ivan raised his arm in victory for that round as the happy Russian politicians looked on. Round 5: Drago tried to punch Rocky, but Rocky managed to duck under and tie up Drago in bear-hold. They spun around in circles before the ref finally broke them up. Drago then continued his dominance he had in the third round and pummeled Rocky. Rocky didn't weaken though, he just kept on fighting. He tied up Drago in another spinning circle again, but this time when the ref separated them Drago's punch was so hard that it sent Rocky to the ground. He got up quickly as Drago stood in disbelief. Ding Ding!! The round had ended and both fighters went back into their corners. Tony patted Rocky on the back as he got on the stool. Ding Ding! Round 6: Drago got out from his corner in fury, wanting to crush this small American once and for all. It didn't work out so well. In his rage his attacks were more flailed around more and Rocky easily dodged them. Then Rocky began to beat up the Russian with all of his might, backing the Russian into a corner and beating him with every his arms had in them. Ding Ding! Drago went back to his corner, defeated in that round, and was determined to do better next time around. Round 7 was his chance. He got Rocky into a corner and began unleashing an army of blows upon him, but Rocky fought back and eventually brought the fight back into the center of the ring. Bam! A leaping blow damages Drago! Bam! A punch from Drago sends Rocky into a corner! Rocky quickly recovered from that and went back to trading punches with Drago. Rocky then gained the advantage late in the round and gave Drago more punches than a machine gun could have given him bullets in the same amount of time. Drago coughed up blood as his government watched, looking a little bit less than pleased. Round 8 was an interesting round for the fight. In this round Drago and Rocky decided to use some ki techniques. Drago began with a large energy blast similar to the Kamehameha wave, and Rocky countered with the Kamehameha wave. It was unclear if this was allowed or not in boxing, but the officials did nothing to stop it, they just stood out of the way. After the blast both faded (they exploded in the middle) Rocky and Drago did both did an interesting and strange technique. Both of them made duplicates of themselves out of ki energy, and the two warriors fought each other in the center of the ring. The glowing red-white and blue Rocky fought the yellow and red Ivan Drago. Suddenly another Rocky and Drago energy creation was made by both sides. Soon there were ten on each side, battling for supremacy. Then, all of the Drago fists met with all of the Rocky fists in a huge explosion as the bell rang. Both fighters got in their corners to prepare for the next round. Round 9: Drago, by this time, was fuming with rage. Drago quickly got Rocky into a corner but got pushed back by Rocky, who then yelled for him to come and attack. Drago moved forward only to get punched in the head by Rocky. Rocky brought the fight back into the center of the ring by attacking Drago to make him move there. Then Drago started attacking Rocky by punching him in the head, but Rocky kept moving forward, trying to get Drago into a corner. He did, and once he got there he gave much slower punches, but they were the most powerful ones he had thrown all night. Then, with one powerful fist, he pounded Drago in the head and that resulted in Drago's sweat flying away as if there had been an explosion on his skin. Round 10 was fought entirely in one corner. Rocky had been backed into a corner by Drago, who had the advantage at that time. But soon Rocky fought back while still in the corner, and he ended up pummeling Drago for a while. Then it was Drago who pummeled Rocky, and so on and so on. Rocky tried to move forward at one point, but Drago threw him into the corner. Rocky fell to the ground hard but quickly got up. His sheer determination was starting to win over some of the crowd, and there were a few scattered cheers for Rocky Pinnicle. When Rock fell to the ground in that round, Drago looked at him with a look of anger and hatred. When he began to get up, Drago looked at him with a sympathetic and somewhat of an understanding look. Ding Ding! The Round ended before any more punches could be thrown! Round 11 was another interesting round. When dodging one of Drago's punches, Rocky flew into the air. Drago got up in the air too, and soon both were near the ceiling and fighting their duel up there. At one point in their aerial battle Rocky grabbed Drago and threw him towards the ground. Drago stopped himself halfway down and charged back upwards only to be met by a Kamehameha wave. The wave was pushing Drago down, but he punched it back at Rocky, who was then hit by the blast and fell all the way down to the floor of the ring. Rocky was hurt, but he got up just as quickly and the two continued their fight on the ground. Ding Ding! The round ended and both fighters went back into their corners. Drago was standing tall as a blast of water came out from his water bottle and went into his mouth. He swished it around angrily as he looked at Rocky, sitting on his stool, in intense pain. He spit out the water into the bucket and made an angry scowl at Rocky. \"Come on!\" Rocky yelled, extending his arm. \"Daa!!\" replied Drago, in anger. Round 12: Rocky began strong, punching away at Drago's mid-section. Drago then punched Rocky in a furious manner, and his opponent fell to the ground. Rocky quickly got up from this and got a lot of cheers from the audience, which now seemed to be cheering for him more than their own Drago. By this point both fighters were groggy and their blows were getting slow. As they moved across the ring they exchanged weaker and slower blows. At one point they just stopped in the center and took turns hitting the other fighter's head, each blow causing sweat and blood to fly off of their bodies. Then the bell rang to end the round. \"No pain!!\" yelled Tony. Rocky just nodded at that. \" He is weak!! Weak!! \" yelled Drago's trainer. He just nodded. Then, before the bell had rung, Rocky got up from his stool, as did Drago. They stood up tall, ready to fight. Round 13 was an unlucky round (at first) for Rocky. Drago began to dominate once again and greatly injure Rocky. It seemed as if Rocky might lose the fight in this round. Drago was seemingly unbeatable. But then the crowd cheered for Rocky. They cheered with incredibly might, and Rocky got up. He then went back to fighting Drago. He was fighting for them, for him, for America and for Apollo. Bam! Bam! Rocky was now the one taking charge. Then it was Drago, then Rocky, then Drago. Then they began to block each other's blows with other elbows and fists. The round ended slowly as the two struggled to lift their arms to throw more punches. They were incredibly sluggish at this point. There was no strategy: just strength. The strongest one would be the survivor. Round 14 was pure hell for both fighters. Every punch used up large amounts of ki, every blow damaged them more than the last. They were using everything they had in this round. Every little bit of energy they had stored in them was being used, and more blood was shed in this round because of it. By the end of the round, there was no ki left in either of them. It was just another back and forth exchange of blows between them, incredibly slow and painful blows. It was just as painful to throw the punch as to receive, yet both kept on fighting with all their might. Even when the bell rang they kept the exchange of punches going and were eventually pulled apart by their teams. As they were being pulled apart, Kotoff left his seat and headed towards the ring. Those 14 rounds had been 42 minutes of pain and struggle for each fighter, and the resting minutes in between were even more painful because they did not have the fight to distract from the pain. Rocky had won over the Soviet crowd, who were now all chanting for him. \"It's amazing! The champ's determination has actually won what was once an extremely hostile crowd! This is incredible!!\" Kotoff came up to Rimski and held him by the collar. \" You trained this fool! He is a disgrace!! \" yelled Kotoff as he threw back Drago's lead trainer. Kotoff then turned towards Drago and spoke to him: \" Listen to them…Our people cheer for iHIM!/i…You idiot! \" Kotoff pushed Drago's head as he said, \" Win! \" Drago looked at Kotoff with angry eyes. This man had ruled over his life, had forced him to kill, had forced him to become the bad guy. Drago stood up and raised Kotoff by the neck into the air. Drago's wife yelled for him to drop him, which he did. Drago then began to speak to the crowd. \" I fight to win!! For me!! For me!! \" Drago yelled to the crowd. \"What round is it?\" Rocky asked faintly. \"15. One more round. There's no stopping this now. This is our round,\" replied Tony. \"We're not stopping now. Don't stop! All your spirit! All your love! Everything you've got! To win you gotta punch and punch till you can't punch no more! This is your whole life here!! Do it now!! Now!!\" Ding ding! Rocky and Drago met in the center of the ring. Drago raised his gloves to his stomach, as did Rocky. Drago gently pushed Rocky's gloves and spoke to him softly saying, \"To the end…\" Rocky looked at him, slightly surprised by this show of emotion. The two circled each other as Rocky came to the realization that Drago had no choice but to kill Apollo. If he didn't kill him: he'd be killed. He was nothing but a pawn, a slave to a brutal system that he used to have faith in. And now Rocky was fighting a man who had realized his sinful mistakes on the very same day that his savior…the man who came to save them all from sin was born. Rocky felt a bit of guilt on his part for partaking in brutal warfare on this holy day of days. Drago punched Rocky in the head. Then another punch from Drago. \"Come on!\" Drago said in a muffled voice, inviting Rocky with his arm to attack. Did he want to lose? Did he want Rocky to knock him out and make this evil empire fall? Bam! Bam! Bam! Three powerful punches from Drago. Maybe not. Or maybe Drago wanted Rocky to win, but having to use everything in him to do so. \"Come on!! What are you waiting for?\" yelled Tony. \"Come on!!\" yelled Drago, inviting Rocky forward with hi arm. Drago punched Rocky, and then got the same invitation from Rocky he had been getting. Drago accepted it and threw a punch at Rocky. He dodged it by moving his head to the side. Then another punch was dodged the same way. After Rocky dodged four punches Rocky yelled \"Come on!! Fight!!\" Bam! Drago punched Rocky and invited him to come and attack. Rocky didn't, and thus did Drago begin to be the one throwing all the punches. Then Rocky made a leaping punch at Drago's head, and it created a loud thud on impact. Another powerful leaping punch! And another! Drago was in the lower right hand corner of the ring, and Rocky began punching him strongly. They moved to the end of the ropes for a bit, but then Rocky punched Drago back into the corner. Drago then unleashed a powerful blow to Rocky's head, sending him stuttering back a few feet. Then in the center of the ring they once again began that famous exchange of punches. Bam! Drago made a powerful punch! Bam! Rocky made a powerful punch! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Then Drago suddenly got three punches in. But Rocky made up for it by giving Drago punches the body as opposed to the head. He slowly but surely began pounding Drago's gut with his right arm. Then he began punching Drago's head, first with his left and then his right. Then Drago began punching at Rocky and they re-entered the center of the ring. Bam! Bam! Rocky was the only one of them getting blows in. He was pounding away with the last of his strength. \"You're gonna do it!!\" yelled Taarin from the crowd. Bam! Drago spun around slightly before falling to the ground hard. Rocky had made the giant Russian fall for the first time in the long match. Rocky ran towards him but the ref pushed him back. He ran towards him again yelling \"Come on! Come on!!\" but the ref pushed him back again and began the count. \" 1…2… \" \" Get up, Ivan!! \" yelled Ludmilla. \" 3…4…5…6… \" Drago struggled to get up, clinging onto the ropes for support. He slowly managed to raise himself off the ground. \" 7…8…9…10!! \" Drago fell through the ropes at that sound and Rocky raised both his arms in victory as he shut his eyes tight. The entire ring began to fill with people. \"10!! Rocky Pinnicle has done it!! This is absolute pandemonium and the crowd loves it!!\" The crowd was proudly chanting Rocky's name as the crowd in the ring lifted him up. Maci draped him with his American flag and Rocky waved to the people. Drago had only the ref to help get him up after the painful match. As Drago got back into a standing position, Rocky was lowered to the ground. A microphone was put in front of his face. \"Thank…thank you,\" Rocky said, out of breath. Bearfrog, holding the mic quickly put the mic up to his mouth and translated the words for the people. \"I came here tonight, and I didn't know what to expect…\" said Rocky. BearFrog than translated it into Russian for the crowd. \"I've seen a lot of people hating me…I didn't know how…to feel about that…so I guess…I didn't really like you much either…\" BearFrog said a much shorter phrase since he didn't know how to translate everything Rocky said. He just hoped the people got the jist of it. \"During this…fight…I've seen a lot of changing…the way you felt about me…and the way I felt about you…\" Rocky said, BearFrog cutting in between each break to translate. \"In here…there were two men…killing each other…but…I guess…that's better…than twenty million…\" Kotoff had returned to the others after being tossed down by Drago and was sitting with an angry scowl on his face while his fellow members of the Soviet government were listening intently to Rocky. \"All I'm trying to say is…If I can change…And you can change…Anybody can change!!\" The crowd cheered wildly at this. There was an explosion of applause from the crowd. Every government official seated in the balcony gave Rocky a slow standing ovation. Except for Kotoff. He was still sitting when the other members looked at him angrily, and he then got up and applauded. \"I just want to say one thing, to my girlfriend out in the crowd…Taarin! I love you!!\" yelled Rocky. BearFrog translated. \"And Merry Christmas to all of you!!\" \" And Merry Christmas to all of you!! \" Taarin met Rocky in the center of the ring and they gave each other a loving hug. \"Oh Rocky, I love you!!\" she said before she kissed him. \"Will you marry me?\" he asked. \"What?\" \"Will you marry me?\" \"Yes!! Oh, yes!!\" she yelled as she hugged her future husband. BearFrog was kind enough to translate for both of them, even using Taarin's dramatic feminine tones when speaking. It made him giggle on the side. Silence in the darkness creeps into your soul Envy moves the light of self control The gate that holds you captive has the door Burnin' with determination to even up the score Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high The moment of truth draws near Time will not allow you to stay still, no Silence breaks the heart and bends the will Defense is guilty passions out of control Rules and regulations have no meaning any more Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high The moment of truth is here Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Fever's risin', energizin', right up to till end Heart's on fire Strong desire Rages deep within Fever's risin' Energizin' Right up till the end Ooooh Heart's on fire Strong desire Raging till the end… Epilogue: Kotoff's comrades in government overthrew him and his evil regime. Together they restored things back to the way they were after the Cold War, only this time they were working to turn China, Cuba and North Korea into Democratic Non-Communist Nations. Relations has been going well and it seems that world peace is getting closer and closer by the day. Who knows, it may even reach that point someday… But, if evil should ever rear its ugly head again, another hero shall step up and rise to the call. His heart will be burning with the fires of a thousand suns and he won't stop fighting. He'll be there right up till the end…His strong desire raging until the end of the battle. For even if this hero loses, he will not lose without a fight. And as for the hero of our story, he and Taarin were happily married in a beautiful cathedral inside of the great city of Boston. That, to him, was an even bigger victory than his match against Ivan Drago.","LastChapter":"A Pinnicle-Mazz Production A BearFrog Fanfic Darkness. Pure darkness consumes all. Wait! A glimmer of silver has appeared. The whole world watches, as there is nothing else to see, as the silver object floats up. A boxing glove. A lone silver boxing glove, with so much power within it that no one wishes to feel its wrath. \"ARRRGH!!\" \"Again! Again!\" Suddenly, the rival to this glove appears. Another silver glove floats in the empty darkness. The glove has as much power as the other. The first glove begins to rotate and reveal itself, showing it's red and white stripes alongside it's white stars engulfed in blue proudly. The other glove shows it colors proudly too. A red background with a yellow symbol, that of a star, a hammer and a sickle. This symbol became weak in the 90s but has come back, and it's powerful. \"He's getting killed out there!\" \"No he's not getting killed, he's getting him mad!\" The two gloves charge toward one another. The hatred they hold for each other is beyond comprehension. The two fists meet and as they impact an explosion of fury erupts. Risin up,back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet Just a man and his will to survive \"Come on! Whole world's watching, knock me out! Come on, knock me out!\" yelled Rocky. Clubber hit Rocky hard in the back. Rocky smugly said \"Hit me harder! Come on!\" Clubber responded by giving him another blow to the side of Rocky's gut. Apollo's trainer cried out to Rocky screaming \"Noooo!\" Clubber unleashed a hard left to Rocky's defensive arms. His white mouthpiece was a combo of disgusting red and yellow. His mouth opened wide before the next hit, which was a right to Rocky's guarding arms. He managed to get Rocky in the back of the head. Rocky was now moving away from Clubber, even as another punch was hit on the back of his head. So many times, it happens too fast You trade your passion for glory Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past You must fight just to keep them alive \"Come on champ! Ain't so bad! Ain't so bad! Ain't nothin'!\" yelled Rocky as he tried to move his injured mouth, which was difficult with blood dripping into his mouth. Rocky was backed into a corner. Clubber's blows kept missing. Rocky had planned this and began attacking Clubber and moving out of the corner. Then with one huge blow, Rocky punched Clubber Lang in the head, and the behemoth fell to the ground. It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight Risin' up to the challenge of our rival And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night Clubber Lang got on his hands and knees and began shaking his head to regain some focus. He did around the first second he was on the ground. He looked up into Rocky's eyes and saw something that wasn't there before. \"Stay down…\" cried Taarin. Those eyes…they once were his. Rocky had Clubber's eyes. Clubber never had blue eyes, but the look…Clubber had looked for it in the mirror everyday and could not find it. He now knew what that look was. He lost the Eye of the Tiger. He knew he had no chance of winning the fight. In shock, he stayed there for the full ten seconds. Rocky Pinnicle regained his title. He jumped up in the air with joy and the ring was flooded with his friends. And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger… Rocky IV Starring Rocky Pinnicle \"Come on, we made a deal!\" said Apollo as they entered the dark gym and walked towards the ring. Apollo was wearing red shorts while Rocky was wearing yellow. \"I know, but this is extremely crazy.\" Apollo Creed \"I know, it's mentally irregular. But it makes all the sense in the world. You owe me a favor.\" John Mazz \"I know, but when did you think of this?\" \"About three years ago. Last time you beat by one second, one second. That's hard for someone of my intelligence to handle.\" \"I thought you said that after I beat you, you learned to live with it.\" Ivan Drago \"I lied.\" Said Apollo jocundly as they entered the ring. \"So this is just to prove it to yourself, huh? \"That's right. No T.V.s, no camera crews, no crowd. Just you, me and the ring.\" And Bob as Bob \"You sure you want to do this? You taught me all you know.\" \"Almost everything. You fight great but I am a great fighter.\" Said Apollo as he put his mouthpiece in. \"You wanna ring the bell?\" Rocky asked. \"Sure. Ding, Ding.\" Said Apollo as he moved his left arm in the air jokingly. \"Wow, looking smooth.\" \"I taught you well, Mountain.\" \"I might aim for the wrong guy.\" And then the two threw a punch at the other's head at the exact same moment. That fight, which not even I know the outcome of, was one of Pinnicle's greatest bouts… \"Rocky IV\" written by Sylvester Stallone Neptune Circle created by Rocky Pinnicle and John Mazz Fanfiction written by BearFrog The television suddenly blinks on. A yellow city appears on the t.v. with jazzy music in the background. \"From NBC Studios in New York… Late Night with Conan O' Brien! Tonight, from the hit t-v show 'Cooking with James'…Migos Username! Also tonight, the author of many great horror stories… Bovine Sith! Last but not least, Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world and one of the best flash artists ever…Rocky Pinnicle! Musical Guest Papa Roach!\" Suddenly the scene shifts to inside the room where the magic takes place. \"With Max Weinberg and the Max Weinberg Seven! And here he is…your O' Brien!\" yelled the announcer as the screen moved to the area where Conan does his monologue each night. He did his usual strange dance, with the licking of his hair and the music intensifying and finishing off with a big jump, which ended the music. A little bit of drumming was done as Conan moved around a bit but that's all the music that was given. The applause was gigantic, since Pinnicle had a huge fanbase. \"Wow. Let me tell you folks right now that you are in for a great show. Lots to talk about, let's start off with some world news. Recently the Soviet Union has reformed, I'm sure you've all heard about this. All the former Soviet Republics have been keeping real quiet for months and then suddenly told the world society that the U.S.S.R. is back. \" The crowd was pretty quiet about Conan's statement. They all had heard about it. The Cold War was back on. \"Yeah, pretty amazing isn't it? The first thing they said after they declared the reformation was 'You can keep the girls we sent you.' \" The crowd gave a faint giggle. \"Hey, you've got the easy job! I've got to say these jokes!\" screamed Conan. \"But seriously, we have a great show tonight. I say that every night because I have to, but tonight we really have a great show. We have Migo from the show Cooking with James.\" Conan said and the crowd cheered madly. \"Good show, good show. Also tonight we have someone who is very interesting. If any of you can read you might know about his great books. We will be having Bovine Sith on our show tonight!\" Conan told the crowd. Once the wave of cheers faded he started talking again. \"Also tonight we have the heavyweight champion making his first press appearance after his victory of Clubber Lang three weeks ago…Rocky Pinnicle!\" The crowd let out it's biggest cheer yet. \"And finally we'll have musical guest Papa Roach! And here's Max Weinberg and the Max Weinberg Seven!\" yelled Conan as he pointed to Max and his band who began playing as Conan went to his seat. \"Now as you all know, unless you're like that chick from 50 First Dates and have crappy memory, the Soviet Union has reformed itself. It even has China under its rule. The only former Soviet republic not a part of the new U.S.S.R. is Germany. Now here is one question I have to ask: How did we miss that? How can you not notice the biggest Communist Empire in the world rebuilding itself? This isn't the kind of thing that just sneaks up on you. But on a positive note, at least it's just the Soviet Union. It's not like the Roman Empire. This country has never done anything wrong and to prove it we're going to show you a special tribute to this great country. Let's take a look.\" A video plays, playing happy music as it shows clips of all the terrible things the Soviets did to its people, like slave labor and no rights and concentration camps. It also shows all the horrible things the Soviet countries have done. After watching the video, Conan was seen laughing and said \"We are going to get so many angry letters tonight.\" Conan said, laughing. The crowd laughed at this too. \"Our fist guest tonight is from the one cooking show that has actual humor and real food. From the hit t.v. show 'Cooking with James' , the co-star of the show. Migos Username! Migo!\" yelled Conan. Migo walked into the room and waved at the crowd as they cheered him on. He sat down on his seat comfortably, shook hands with Conan and began the interview. \"It's a pleasure to have you here. It really is. I just love your show.\" \"Thanks.\" \"I think the show is pure genius. It has real comedy and real food in the same show which is very hard to find. But I have to ask you one question:\" \"Sure.\" \"Do you think that the only reason people watch it is because of Rocky Pinnicle's cameos?\" \"Well, I think that is the reason some boxing fans watch it.\" \"Some boxing fans? What do the other ones watch for? I'm a boxing fan and the only reason I got into the show was because I heard Rocky was on it.\" \"Well that's what get's them in, but then we keep them with our humor and good recipes.\" \" I've noticed Rocky doesn't seem to like much of what you have on the show. You want to share with us one of his favorite recipes?\" \"Rocky really likes the Boxer's Drink.\" \"And what is that? Gatorade or Powerade?\" \"Actually, it's egg yolk in a glass.\" Migo said as the crowd cried \"iwwww.\" In disgust. \"Egg yolk in a glass?\" said Conan with a semi-snorting laugh. \"Yes. You take some eggs, and you crack them. And then the egg yolk goes into the glass. And then you drink it.\" \"This sounds like something my wife made once.\" \"Would you like to try some?\" \"You know, I would but we are out of eggs in the NBC studios kitchen. Brokaw ate them all before he left, so-\" \"I've got some eggs Conan!\" yelled Max as he held up a box of eggs. \"…I'm not gonna even ask why you have those with you.\" Conan said to Max which was followed by laughter from the crowd. \"But still, I don't have glass.\" \"It just so happens that I have a glass.\" Said Migo. \"You have a glass with you? Where do you people keep this stuff?\" \"I don't have it with me, but I can summon it. James taught me a little bit of the dark arts.\" \"Really? This should be interesting. Let's see your dark magic.\" Migo's eyes rolled into the back of his head. The lights flickered on and off until they went off entirely. Then a puff of yellow smoke appeared and the lights turned on. And on Conan's desk and a scary gauntlet appeared on the desk. \"Well, crap. I knew I should've had coffee tonight! Oh well, crack the eggs.\" The eggs were cracked. And then Conan drank the drink. \"What do you think?\" \"There's a reason Rocky Pinnicle can handle anything.\" Conan mumbled queezily. The crowd laughed. \"Migo, everybody! When we come back, Bovine Sith will be here!\" Conan told the audience truthfully. For when the commercials were done and over with, Conan and Migo sat waiting for Bovine. \"Our second guest tonight is an author who makes Stephen King seem like A.A. Milne. Presenting Bovine Sith!\" yelled Conan as the dark figure loomed into his seat, shaking Migo's hand as Migo moved to another seat, and shaking Conan's afterward. \"It's great to have you here.\" \"It's great to be here.\" \"You have a very interesting name. How did you come up with such a name?\" \"Well, I had an obsession with cows and took the name Darth Cow. Eventually I expanded on that name with Bovine Sith.\" \"I went through a cow phase myself.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes, but it ended after a big incident with three midgets and a Canadian officer.\" The crowd laughed at the comment. \"So I understand you know Rocky Pinnicle?\" \"To an extent. I've mostly just written stories about him and the cast of NC on the Neptune Circle forums.\" \"I joined the forums.\" \"Did you?\" \"Yes. John Stewart and me joined. He said we could pick up chicks.\" \"John Stewart lied. And aren't you married?\" \"I wasn't looking for me. I was looking for Triumph. He's very shy online.\" \"That's surprising. So did you read any of my stories?\" \"I've read a few of your stories and let me just say this: you have a sick and twisted mind.\" Conan said and got a laugh. \"I saw Gigli and this gave me even more nightmares.\" \"Still using Gigli jokes?\" \"Well, they made me write the jokes for this one.\" \"Ah.\" \"But seriously, you write some pretty vivid stuff. Your most famous story is very scary, very well written and very suspenseful. But here is one thing I have to ask. Why wasn't P.J. the villain?\" \"P.J. just doesn't make a good villain.\" \"But P.J. is cool!\" \"P.J. is funny, not evil.\" \"We can debate this all night. I've got the time. I usually have time to kill so we can fight about this all night!\" the crowd cheered. \"Any other comments?\" \"It took very long for me to figure out who the killer was. At one point I just skipped the last chapter and started reading backwards until I found out who the killer was.\" \"Well Conan, I wanted to try and keep the killer a secret as long as possible to increase the dramatic effect.\" \"Well, that just got me angry. I'm used to just talking to movie stars, but for you I had to actually expand my mind.\" \"Heh. Sorry about that.\" \"Now, you've written some other works on the site. Are there any you are particularly proud of? I, myself, enjoyed Fortune Teller Sith.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" \"I didn't like that one. I felt I could've done better. It felt like I just threw it together.\" \"Well, I'm not saying it's better than Lord of the Yanmas. I think your fic is an excellent piece of work.\" \"It probably is.\" \"It probably is. How many people say that about their work besides the president?\" \"Heh. No, it's not that it isn't a good piece of work. Far from it, it's just that people's worst critics are usually themselves.\" \"You haven't watched this show before, have you?\" \"Okay, second worst critic.\" \"Thank you!\" \"Heh. So I was listening to your monologue and you might not have known about this little piece of info. China is part of the Soviet Union. And of course Cuba is, who happens to be right by us.\" \"Well we all knew about Cuba. But you are saying that China is now part of the Soviet? China is already huge!\" \"I know. There seems to be a sort of power struggle going on within the government between the Russians and the Chinese. The Chinese only joined because of debt problems, but they want to take control and be the supreme nation in the union.\" \"Wow. I didn't know that. Would you look at that? We are out of time. It's been great having you here.\" Said Conan as he shook Bovine's hand. \"I'll still be here after commercials.\" \"I know, but most celebs can't wait to get out of here so it's sort of a habit. Bovine Sith everybody! When we get back, the world heavyweight champion of boxing Rocky Pinnicle!\" Thus did the commercials air. And then it came time for Rocky to appear. \"Our next guest tonight is the heavyweight champion of the world. He just defeated his most fearsome opponent he has ever faced, Clubber Lang, and won back the title. The Mountain Peak…Rocky Pinnicle! Rocky!\" yelled Conan as the band began playing Rocky's theme. Rocky came out, wearing a early twenties hat and sporting a black eye to go with it. He smiled as he waved to the people and happily shook the hands of Conan, Migo and Bovine before he sat down. \"It's an honor to have you on this show.\" \"Tha-\" \"And I'm not just saying that so you won't beat me up.\" Rocky gave a hearty laugh to Conan's jest before the Irish comedian continued. \"That is a nice hat. I wish I hat a hat like that.\" \"Thank you.\" \"It'd be nice but my hair would just sorta pop it off after it was on my head for three seconds.\" Yet again Conan got laughs. \"So where'd you get the hat?\" \"A friend gave it to me.\" \"You didn't have a black eye after the fight. Where'd you get the black eye?\" \"Same friend.\" Rocky said. This time the crowd laughed at Rocky's true joke. \"You have some pretty screwed up friends.\" Said Conan. The crowd laughed as they began to think of the cast of Neptune Circle. \"You wanna know something?\" \"What?\" \"Even now that I'm so famous, we've only sold about 3 pieces of merchandise on the site, not including the ones we bought for ourselves.\" \"Wow. That is pathetic.\" Said the talk show host as the crowd burst with laughter. \"Maybe you should try getting professional models as opposed to that one angry looking kid.\" \"I've been thinking about it, y'know. It costs a lot to keep the site running and we need the money from the merchandise.\" \"But you are the heavyweight champ. You do get paid a lot.\" \"That is true. The job pays well. But all the money I get goes straight to charity.\" \"Wow. You're a nice guy, taking all those hits for others. Rocky, I heard that you were going to retire. Is this true? Will the final bout that Rocky gives us be Rocky Pinnicle vs Clubber Lang?\" \"Well, I was going to retire because I don't want to get used to all that fancy living and such, y'know? It gets ya weak. So then I decided that I would start a charity foundation and put all of my boxing earnings into that. So boxing would just be my hobby of sorts.\" \"Your hobby?\" \"Yes.\" \"As long as you aren't retiring, that's good with me. So what do you think about the whole Soviet situation.\" \"Well…Tssh. To bad Maci isn't here. I myself don't really care much about the new Cold War. I never understood all the fear and hatred. I say that we should all just be peaceful.\" \"This is coming from a guy who fights people for a hobby.\" \"Hahahaha,\" Laughed Rocky. \"What do you plan on doing once your career is over with?\" \"Well, I was hoping to make a living off of my flash skills.\" \"You are a skilled flash artist. I hope it works out for you.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Rocky Pinnicle everybody!\" Conan yelled loudly. After the commercials he introduced Papa Roach and allowed him to play his song. \"Cut my life into pieces This is my last resort Suffocation no breathing Dont give a #$ if I cut my arm bleeding This is my last resort Cut my life into pieces I've reached my last resort Suffocation no breathing Don't give a#$ if I cut my arm bleeding Do you even care if I die pleading Would it be wrong, would it be right If I took my life tonight Chances are that I might Mutilation out of sight And I'm contemplating suicide Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind Wish some body would tell me I'm fine Losing my sight, losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine I never realized I was spread to thin Till it was to late and I was empty within Hungry, feeding on chaos and living in sin Downward spiral, where do I begin It all started when I lost my mother No love for myself and no love from another Searching to find a love up on a higher level Finding nothing but questions and devils Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind Wish some body would tell me I'm fine Losing my sight, losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine Nothing's alright, nothing is fine I'm running and I'm crying I'm crying I'm crying I'm crying I'm crying I cant go on living this way Cut my life into pieces This is my last resort Suffocation no breathing Don't give a #$ if I cut my arm bleeding Would it be wrong would it be right If I took my life tonight Chances are that I might Mutilation out of sight And I'm contemplating suicide Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine Losing my sight, losing my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine Nothing's alright, nothing is fine I'm running and I'm crying I CAN'T GO ON LIVING THIS LIFE Can't go on Living this way Nothing's alright\" Conan and the other walked on the stage after the song was over. \"I'd like to thank all of our guests! Rocky Pinnicle, Migo, Bovine Sith, and Papa Roach! See you all next week!\" yelled Conan as the show ended and the credits rolled. Conan headed to the parking lot while Rocky, Migo and Bovine headed to the roof. \"You guys coming over for John's birthday?\" asked Rocky. \"That's tonight?\" asked Migo. \"Yeah.\" Replied Rocky. \"I'm not sure I can come. I've got homework. Plus I live pretty far away.\" Migo said quietly. \"Come on! You guys can stop for a few minutes to wish him a happy birthday!\" \"But my present is at my house.\" Bovine retorted. \"Same here.\" Migo chimed. \"Well let's hurry up and grab those gifts! I'll go with Migo and give him a Kamehameha boost to his house. You meet us at John's, okay?\" \"Got it.\" Replied Bovine Sith. Thus did all of them fly into the night sky. Ten minutes later they all arrived at John's front door. Rocky grabbed the doorknob and lead them in. Shalashaska and James were sitting on the couch, watching Buff the Vampire Slayer. Eyes glued to the screen, they did not even notice Rocky and the others enter the room. \"Hey, guys.\" Rocky said as he casually entered. \"Shhh!\" screamed James, who had not yet seen this episode. Shala had seen every episode, yet he enjoyed the occasional re-run. \"We're here.\" Rocky told everyone in the room. \"Rocky! Hey, what's up?\" asked James as he got up. \"Nothing much. We were on Conan's show.\" \"Really? We missed it. Buffy Marathon, y'know.\" Shala said to Rocky. \"Don't worry, I have the VCR set upstairs.\" Rocky grinned. \"I'm glad you're here because I was getting hungry.\" Said James as his stomach growled. The group went into the dining room, where John sat, making some sort of flash on his laptop. \"I've had time to make three games.\" John muttered when he heard them enter, not even looking up from his laptop. \"Sorry, we're late.\" Rocky told John cheerfully. John closed the file and shutdown his laptop. \"If we waited any longer it'd be my next birthday.\" Said John as he closed the laptop. \"Bovine, Migo! Glad you could make it!\" \"We can't stay long. We got to head home. We just came to wish you a happy birthday and drop off our presents.\" \"Thanks guys.\" Said John as they set down the gifts on the gift table. \"Happy birthday.\" Migo said as he left. \"Happy Birthday.\" Bovine said as he left. And then the room was silent, except for P.J. lazily twirling a noise-maker. Rocky then asked John \"Are you ready for your present?\" \"Is it in the driveway?\" asked John. \"Here, limme dim the lights to set the mood.\" Said Rocky as the lights dimmed. Suddenly, Boot hovered in, holding John's cakes and with techno music coming out of it's speakers. \"What? The cake?\" asked John quizzically. \"No, not the cake! Can't you tell that I rewired Boot to make him run more efficiently?\" asked Rocky. John looked at Boot. \"I can tell by the slight glitter build up on the outside that you tried switching the X and Z cables with Carbon based fluid as opposed to Oxygen based fluid. However the energy burst is only temporary and harmful if used for too long. But a nice attempt.\" Rock sighed. What could he get a computer genius that the genius couldn't make it himself in five minutes. John looked at the cake that Boot set down. He made a mental note to fix Boot as he looked at his cake, with a picture of the flash version of himself on the cake, except wearing a ninja outfit but no mask on his head. \"That's a good lookin' guy.\" John joked as the cake was cut and the pieces were handed out to everyone in the room. After that, it was time to open presents. P.J. had gotten John a hat in which you can drink beverages without hands. Migo had gotten John a cookbook. James got John a very long chain. Chad got John some underwear (thankfully unused). Maci gave John a M-16. Bob gave John a dead Squirrel. Clarence gave John a fruitcake. Taarin and Cat had given John a big box of chocolates. Shala got John a copy of Chrono Trigger. Boot gave John an upgrade on John' laptop. Bovine Sith gave John a Smart Board, which John of course loved since he could see his flash movies on a screen bigger than a television. Fargoth and Cyber B made John a flash movie together using sprites Cyber made. \"Well, that's all of them.\" John said, happy with his presents. \"Wait, there's one more.\" Said Cat as she picked up the last present which seemed to be the size of one of the newer Harry Potter books. John grabbed it and looked at the label. It was from BearFrog. \"BearFrog? I didn't see him come here.\" Said John as he tore open the present to find to video tapes. One was labeled 'A Christmas Carol' and the other was labeled 'Fight Remix'. John laughed at loud as he remembered when BearFrog had told him about these tapes. A Christmas Carol was a school project when he used Video from RPG Maker and Audio from The Muppet Christmas Carol. Fight Remix was a video tape with an hour of non-stop fighting. John set them down and noticed a sticky note on the back of Fight Remix. John tore it off and began reading. I Dear John, Happy Birthday! I hope you enjoy the presents. I'm sorry I could not join you on this occasion, but I have very important matters to attend to. I'll see ya later. -BearFrog /I BearFrog was in China. He was with the rest of the crowd who were all on the Great Wall. Next to the wall, a ring had been made. This ring was to host the Soviet Union's Heavyweight World Amateur Championship Boxing Match. This match was Communist vs Communist, Russia vs China. This fight was not only going to decide their champion, but also which side would take political control. This bet had many people anxious. However, almost nobody in the outside world knew about the wager, let alone the match. Yet BearFrog did know, and he was there. He had to see if the rumors were true. He had to see the… Super Warriors. Suddenly, music began playing. Very light music, played on some sort of string instrument. Then BearFrog saw the first contestant walk towards the ring, punching the air as he moved. He was wearing no robe, but he was wearing red shorts with yellow stars. His gloves were the same too. His face was a little deformed and he had very large eyes. The Asian man punched the air real hard so anyone who knew enough about Ki could feel his power. And BearFrog felt it. The power this fighter had was a little bit shocking, but still it was probably just the one boxer. The rumor about the Super Warriors couldn't be true… The man stood in the ring as he waited for his Russian rival to enter the ring. He danced around as he waited. Then suddenly, a hole in the ground opened up. Smoke appeared. Nobody could see. Then the smoke cleared and the giant behemoth of a Russian stood in his corner of the ring, eyes staring at nothing in particular. His crew was right there behind him. The Russian had his blonde hair raised so it looked like a crew cut. His size, over seven feet. His muscles, gigantic. His emotion, none. And his shorts, depicting his nation's symbol of a hammer and sickle with a star. BearFrog could feel no energy specialties for this one and assumed Joe Chan would easily win. \" Ladies and Gentleman! \" cried the Russian announcer. BearFrog got an F in Russian class, but was glad he at least knew some of the language so perhaps he could find out a little about the opponents. \" Welcome boxing comrade vs comrade. \" BearFrog heard the announcer say. He silently cursed himself for not trying harder in Russian class. He did try hard, true, but not as hard as he could have. He focused himself more and tried to grasp what the man was saying. \" Tonight great match. In Red corner, from Cheng Du, China and weighing 86 kilos, The Eastern Dragon: Quick Fists Joe Chan! \" cried the announcer as he pointed to the thin Asian. \" And in the yellow corner, from Moscow Russia! Weighing in at 118 kilos, The Siberian Bull! Ivan Drago! !\" BearFrog looked intensely at Drago. Drago seemed so emotionless, and yet…so powerful. The presence BearFrog felt was one that could only be felt if one had a true understanding of Ki, for Ivan's Ki was well hidden. Surpressed. Yet BearFrog could feel the destructive power and had now assumed the victor, but he knew to never count out the little guy. The fight began with the ringing of a bell. Ivan and Joe circled each other, trying to get a feel for their opponent. Chan decided to throw a few test punches at Drago. A right to the head. Another right to the head. And another right. Then a left. \"How can this short guy's arms reach up there?\" BearFrog said aloud in his natural tongue. Someone turned and looked at BearFrog face and then walked toward a Chinese soldier. The officer came up behind BearFrog and put his hand on BearFrog's shoulder. BearFrog's turned quickly. \" Excuse me, sir but I will need you to come with me. \" the man said in Chinese, which BearFrog did not understand in the least. \"No hablo ingles, I mean uhh…\" BearFrog said struggling to find the right words in Russian. \"American!\" yelled the Chinese man in a way that BearFrog could clearly understand. He jumped off of the tower and landed ringside. They began shooting at BearFrog until a Russian politician of some sort shouted at them and apparently told them to stop shooting. However, the men did come to attack the alien. Joe Chan was wondering why his opponent was standing there taking blows. Joe began throwing hard punches and yet the giant remained still. He began giving all he had and then suddenly, he felt a gigantic blow to the gut. One punch knocked him down in the first round. Joe lost. \"I don't want to hurt anyone, so please don't fight me.\" BearFrog told them calmly. Even if they could understand, the response would have been the same. The group of soldiers attacked BearFrog with broadswords in hand. BearFrog easily dodged all of the blows and defeated all the guards by pushing on a pressure point in the back of their necks, which put all of them in a temporary coma. \" Our comrade won the fight, so we get control as agreed. \" the Russian Premier said to the Chinese leader. The fat man grumbled at that but nodded. \" Wow, what skill. \" commented one Chinese politician. \" Yes, Ivan fought amazingly. \" the new leader cried happily. \" No, that intruder. His skill is amazing. \" The Premier looked out of the glass booth and saw the intruder. It was obviously a young American, but his skill was quite interesting. Not all Americans even knew about Ki and yet this one understood it. Well. \" Why don't we have a little fun? \" the Premier suggested as he took out his cell phone. At ringside, Ivan's trainer took out his phone and understood the instructions. Just as BearFrog tried to leave, Ivan exited the ring and punched at BearFrog who jumped up and landed on Ivan's outstretched arm and then kicked Ivan in the face before jumping to the ground. But the kick seemed to do nothing. \" Well, you're pretty strong aren't you? \" said BearFrog grinning. Ivan responded by throwing punches at BearFrog, who dodged them by jumping backwards. Then he was up against the wall. Ivan threw a punch and BearFrog jumped over Ivan, whose punch made a huge dent in the wall. \" Stop toying with him, Ivan! \" yelled his trainer. \"Toying with m-oof!\" cried Bearfrog as he felt a large hand punch him in the gut. BearFrog fell to the ground, coughing up blood. Ivan loomed over him. Just as he was about to finish him, BearFrog got up. He got on his feet, and looked at Ivan intensely. The politicians were shocked that he got up. Joe Chan, the Chinese champ couldn't even go that far against Ivan. \"Hammer Fist!!\" yelled BearFrog as he jumped in the air and chopped Ivan hard on the skull with a clenched fist. No damage. Ivan then punched BearFrog in the head. BearFrog managed to stay up for about five punches before he fell to the ground and faded into darkness. B Two Months Later… /B \"I can't figure out what the problem is.\" Rocky said as he paced back and forth. John began typing things on the computer and found that it did nothing. The screen remained a glowing blue. John did not want to admit it to Rocky, but the same thing had happened to his computer too and he had no idea how to fix it. His frustration was easily seen. \"Chill out man, okay? Why don't you take a break and read one of my magazines for a while.\" \"Sounds good. Anything new?\" \"I didn't really look at the mail but I'm due for a new Sports Illustrated.\" John gave a grunt as he got up from the couch and then suddenly gasped when he noticed he was sitting on a sleeping Chad. \"Chad! I'm sorry, I didn't see you! Are you okay?\" cried John as Chad opened his eyes slightly. \"Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…\" While John was talking to Chad, Rocky shuffled through the mail and tossed John his new Sports Illustrated. On the cover was Ivan Drago. It was a close up of his head. He wasn't looking at the camera, which took the picture of him on his side. He seemed to be staring at nothing. The cover story was \"Russians Invade U.S. Sports\" \"What?! The Soviet Union is sending athletes into our sports?!\" John said frantically as he turned to read the article. \"What's the big deal?\" \"This is the first contact we've had with the new Soviet Union except for their declare of independence!\" Rocky still didn't understand what the big deal was and decided he might as well read and hope that clears things up for him. The article was called \"Smash and Splash\". The article explained that a Soviet was entering boxing. The article was about the boxer, Ivan Drago who was currently the champion in the Soviet Union and was referred to as \"The World Heavyweight Amateur Champion\". John pointed out to Rocky that Drago was married to a famous Olympic swimmer from the Soviet Union who was coming, but Rocky didn't seem to notice why that piece of information was important. \"Look! It says that they are landing today, with the Russian Premier!\" John cried. The article was correct. The plane landed in Los Angeles, California. Thus did the trio exit the plane, along with other Russians and Chinese men, and faced a media swarm once they entered the airport. \"How long are you here for?\" \"Can I ask you a few questions?\" \"When will your first fight be?\" The reporters were pushed back by security and the only response they got from the communists was from their leader who simply said \"We talk later.\" \"Why is the Soviet Union entering professional sports?\" \"We shall answer all questions at the conference!\" the premier told the crowd as they walked. At the same time in the same city, Apollo was in his pool, relaxing. He was playing fetch with his three golden retrievers and having a fun time. The television he had outside near the pool was on, and a commercial for catfish was on. It had quite a pleasant tune. After the commercial ended the real show was on. \"Today, Russia has told the world that they will be throwing their hat into the ring. The prize ring, that is.\" The reporter announced. Apollo turned his attention to the television. \"The announcement was made by Ludmilla Drago, she was the double gold medalist in swimming.\" The screen switched and showed a beautiful blonde woman with short hair and big blue eyes. She was speaking. \"Today the Soviet Union has officially entered professional boxing. My husband and great undefeated World Heavyweight Amateur Champion, Captain Ivan Drago,\" she said as the camera switched to large man wearing a soviet officer uniform. \"Has come here with his trainers to compete as an international sportsman and an ambassador of good will.\" \"Has Drago ever faced off against a real professional?\" asked one reporter. \"From being trained in Russia by great boxing coach Manuel Rega and now by Sergi Rimski, \" she said as the camera switched to the trainers, who seemed to be in their late fifties or early sixties. \"We can only hope that he is qualified to do so.\" \"Hope?\" \"Well, I know he is but we don't want to sound too confident.\" \"If possible,\" the premier began, \"We would like to have an exhibition bout with your famous champion, Rocky Pinnicle.\" \"What makes you think he can defeat Rocky Pinnicle?\" \"There is nobody who can match his speed, endurance or his aggressiveness.\" \"You make it sound like he is indestructible.\" \"Yes, he is.\" The screen switched back to the main room. \"Well, can this behemoth who has already been nicknamed 'The Siberian Bull' wreak havoc upon the professional ranks? Only time will tell.\" Apollo looked at the screen angrily and tossed the ball out of the pool. He hit the water as he swam towards the steps to exit. Ring! Ring! Ring! \"Hello?\" \"John, do you think you could help me? Something's wrong with my computer. It's just a blank blue screen.\" Asked Jester on the phone. \"Rea-Hold on, I've got another call.\" Said John as he pushed the button. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, John I think my computer has a virus or something.\" Said Iblackedout. \"A virus! That's it!\" yelled John. \"I'll get back to you later!\" he yelled to IBO and Jester and at the same time (he pushed the 3-way calling button so he wouldn't have to repeat his message. John ran up to his room and saw Boot lying on the ground. \"Boot?! Are you okay?!\" John asked. John got no response and realized that this strange virus must have gotten Boot too. John was worried so he flipped on to the news and saw that his fears were confirmed. \"Every Computer in the United States and many other nations seems to be infected with some sort of virus. All the computer factories are shut down due to technical errors with the computers they use, and thus no computer can be used at this time.\" Said the reporter nervously. John had to fix this problem fast, or this would cause mass hysteria. John quickly took out spare parts from his television, phone, microwave, radio and typewriter to make a new computer from scratch. He hooked it up to his smart board so he could have a screen to look at as he entered his text (nothing to make a mouse was available) to search the net. The virus seemed to be on the entire internet. Every site with English text was replaced by a swirling black vortex page. John decided he might as well hack into this page and see what he could find. Code html x swf.file/ 834647/ fmx/ 86586/ 9092746759575663/ -vnrir-05nw/h4ckorzf113/ AOB/$8h B Access Denied /B \"What the? That's my best hacking code! Maybe there is a firewall against it. I guess I'll try out my old one.\" Code fhgnGR4g56748n$G :/hdnrtj4984n/jrhn483&46fvuy3#5/omega.htm B Access Denied /B \"Gah. Whoever did this is good. I guess I have no choice.\" John said to himself. He had no choice but use a virus to destroy it. It was very risky, since his virus threatened to destroy the entire online world, but he had no choice but to send it out. He had to time this right and destroy his virus as soon as it destroys the current virus, or else his creation will surely destroy the entire internet in a matter of minutes. Upload File: My Computer:My Documents: apocalypse.vrs The file was put on the internet. It floated around the cyberspace looking for the biggest thing it could devour. It then saw the gigantic virus that was plaguing computer users all across the globe and decided to make that become its first meal. John began to sweat profusely. His hands twitched on the near the keyboard as he waited for his virus to attack. Slowly his virus entered the demonic web page that held the virus. His virus appeared on the screen. \"Dadadadada! MMMMMBOB!\" cried the 16-bit pixilated Bob as it thunder shocked the virus and then began to eat it. \"Tastes like squirrelie!\" Upload File: My Computer:My Documents: savior.avrs The virus that caused blue screens was gone. Now a new virus remained. But it was soon defeated by the anti-virus which John made. A 16-bit pixilated Squirrel John made. \"Die Squirrelie!\" yelled Bob as she did a thundershock to the squirrel. The anti-virus fell down and had swirly eyes, until Bob walked up to it and ate it. The Squirrel, however, was toxic to the virus. Bob turned purple and fell down and said \"Blarg! I am dead!\" and then depixelized. John gave a sigh of relief and picked up his laptop. The screen had returned to normal. \"Where did that virus come from?\" John said out loud. Boot replied with a bunch of blips and beeps (he had turned back on). \"You're right, it's best not to worry. After all, how could they make a virus better than that?\" John and Boot exited the house and walked over to the street sign that told people they were now on Neptune Circle. That was where everyone would meet up and talk about how their day was. Everyone was there. \"Man, looooong day.\" John said exhaustedly. \"What'd you do today?\" asked Cat. \"I got rid of that virus that was messing with everyone's computers.\" \"I think the government put out that virus, to stop the spread of info about their corrupt organization.\" Maci told the group. \"I ate five gallons of icing.\" P.J. proudly announced. \"How is it that you stay alive?\" Cat asked. \"Me and Bob killed 1000 squirrels.\" Shalashaska told them. \"I killed REAL squirrelies, you just played that game.\" Bob replied. \"I did a new episode of Cooking with James.\" James told the group. \"I slept all day…\" Chad told everyone. \"I had time to re-read 'How to do everything with Flash MX'.\" Rocky said. \"I got a new pair of socks!\" Clarance said excitedly. RING! RING! RING! Rocky opened up his cell phone and answered. \"Hello? Oh, hey Apollo. What's up? What am I doing, I'm doing nothing. What are you doing? Come over? Okay. See ya in a few.\" Said Rocky as he hung up. \"Apollo's coming over for dinner.\" \"We can eat at my place, since nobody's home tonight.\" James offered as he pointed to big black scary looking house, which had dark clouds above it. Suddenly a flash of lightning bolted to the ground and gave a gigantic sound as if the earth was in pain. \"Okay, I'll wait outside him.\" Rocky said as the group entered the house. A few minutes later Apollo appeared over the horizon and landed in front of Rocky. \"Hey mountain.\" Apollo said with a grin. \"Yo Apollo!\" said Rocky as they did a handshake in which their hands met for a brief second and slip off of each other's smoothly. \"We're eating at James' tonight. Follow me.\" Said Rocky as the walked towards the house with Apollo following. Shala was in the living room watching Buffy when John came in suddenly and changed the channel to the news. \"Hey!\" \"You've seen every episode before so let me watch the news.\" \"Fine.\" The screen showed a laboratory. The first thing the camera sees is a large pillar like device with 3 screens on it in a triangle formation. The top one and the one on the right show Ivan Drago in infa-red and the other one shows his vital status. \"My husband and I thank you for coming to our training quarter today,\" Ludmilla said as the camera shifted to her. \"As you can see, it is highly advanced and we wish to show the American press a small portion the advancements our country's made in the technology of human performance.\" \"Deja vu, huh?\" whispered one reporter to his colleague, who giggled quietly. The camera the zoomed in on a demo screen of infa-red Drago punching some sort of punching machine. Then the screen focused on a monitor which seemed to be infa-red versions of human cells beating like heartbeats. \"What does all of this do to enhance performance?\" one reporter asked Drago's trainer as the camera moved onto the trainer. \"Well-\" he began before the premier put his hand on the coach's shoulder saying \"If I may answer,\" \"It makes a man, a better man. A great athlete is super athlete by harnessing all of his strength. Though most of the world is ignorant in body chemistry we wish to…educate your country.\" Said the premier as the camera slowly moved to right, moving past Ludmilla who was standing next to him until it got to a side view of Drago, who was wearing a white tanktop and tight white shorts. On the top was the soviet symbol depicted in the color red. \"There have been rumors of blood doping and wide distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union. Has Drago participated in any such experiments?\" asked one reporter. \"No,\" said Ludmilla shaking her head smiling, \"Ivan is naturally trained.\" \"Then how do you explain his freakish strength?\" \"Like your Popeye: He ate his spinach every day.\" She replied jocundly. The crowd laughed. \"Shall we have a demonstration?\" asked the premier. \"Please.\" Said the reporter. \"Thank you,\" replied the premier as the camera shifted to pay more attention to Drago. He stood facing the punching machine, which looked like a square piece of a red heavy-bag on a spring like the kind of boxing gloves the Joker would use against Batman. \"A normal heavyweight averages seven-hundred and fifty pounds of pressure per square inch.\" Said the premier as Drago stood ready to punch. He looked at the premier, who nodded and then punched the machine. Above the machine was a black rectangular screen which normally had words slowly moving across it like in Stock Markets, but it suddenly stopped to relay a message. Drago's punch was 3850 Psi. \"The result is quite obvious.\" Said the premier. \"What result is that?\" asked the same reporter. \"Whatever he hits, he destroys.\" \"He didn't destroy me…\" BearFrog said with a smirk. He could not see the television broadcast but could hear it. The guards had a television in the dungeon to keep themselves occupied while they watched BearFrog. BearFrog was strapped to table via diamond restraints that looked like ordinary metal restraints. But these were much harder to break out of. BearFrog had endured a month of torture as the communists performed experiments on him (he hated the anal probe the worst) and was getting sick and tired of going through all of it. \"Will you talk today?\" asked the Russian general as he entered the room and turned off the television. The old general was in his sixties but had a gigantic body and was in amazing shape, yet his face showed that he was old even though he had quite a powerful look on his crew cut head. \"Tell me, where did you learn how to use your Ki?!\" asked the general angrily. \"You know, I'm just getting sick of this. I saved up enough energy to get out of here, so I'm gonna leave now. Bye.\" Said BearFrog as he suddenly moved his arms up and allowed the restraints to break in half. He then ripped of the restraints on his ankles and kicked the general in the gut. \" Comrade Picard! \" yelled one soldier before BearFrog knocked him into a wall with a punch. After knocking out the other guard BearFrog ran out of the high-tech torture chamber into the clean blue futuristic hallway. Suddenly, the lights turned red and the alarms were activated. \" Comrades! 2 intruders have escaped! \" yelled the voice. \"Two?\" BearFrog said out loud and then noticed was running alongside him. \"Turtle Man?! What the hell are you doing here?!\" Turtle Man replied with a shrug as they ran through the complex until they saw an open door and quickly entered. BearFrog pushed a button on wall and the door shut with a 'whoosh'. He gave a big sigh and then sat down on the floor. \"Dude, check it out! It's like Comp-USA, only better!\" cried Turtle Man. \"Comp-USSR…\" BearFrog muttered as he got up and looked around at the highly advanced room. The soviets must've been preparing a hostile take-over of the former republics for a while. After dusting off his butt, BearFrog walked towards a computer with Turtle Man following. The text was in Russian yet BearFrog slowly translated the material. It was a menu that had links to a few files. General Data Storage Doc 1. Re-unification Doc 2. H.D.P. Doc 3. D.O.A.S. \"Interesting.\" BearFrog said. \"What? I can't read Russian. What does it say?\" Turtle Man asked. \"It's some documents that the Soviet Union has kept. These documents probably explain some secret stuff, but not in detail that is too intense.\" \"You sure?\" \"We won't know until we try.\" BearFrog double clicked on the first document as the alarms went off (the soviets assumed they were long gone). Username : Password : \"What are you gonna do?\" asked Turtle Man. \"Take a stab at it.\" Username : Lenin Password : Access Granted \"What did you type in for a password?\" \"Ivan Drago.\" BearFrog said with a smirk. \"Man I'm hungry.\" Turtle Man announced. Elsewhere, a post dinner conversation was being held. The room was dark and gloomy with cobwebs on the wall. In the center of the room was a long black gothic table. Sitting there were the good folks who live on Neptune Circle and their guest from Las Angeles, Apollo Creed. \"He's trying to fight when he's an amateur. He's big and he's strong but he's clumsy. I know I can beat him.\" Apollo told the group. \"Why do you want to fight again?\" Cat asked softly. \"Let's just say that it's something I believe in.\" Apollo replied. \"Hey, don't you think people are expecting Rocky to take out this bum first?\" Maci asked. \"Yeah, he will. When it's for real. This is just an exhibition bout, kid's stuff.\" Said Apollo with a faint laugh. \"Why would you want to fight a big man like that? Why be at risk?\" Clarance asked. \"I don't this chump coming over with all this hype. Trying to make us look bad.\" Apollo said. \"But we ARE bad.\" Maci replied. Apollo ignored the comment and continued. \"With Rock's help we can get great media coverage, make them look bad for a change.\" Apollo said. Rocky's smile grew suddenly at the comment. \"I think it's wrong.\" Taarin protested. \"No, it's never been more right.\" Apollo replied. \"You haven't fought for a long time Apollo.\" Taarin began as Apollo and Rocky winked at each other. \"How much can you take? Either of you.\" she asked them. \"Taarin, we've fought tough enemies before and this guy is just some cocky foreigner.\" John said happily. \"Heck, Clarance could probably take him.\" The entire table roared with laughter except from Taarin and Cat, who kept their paranoid fears. \"Paranoid fears are what shall sustain the new government. If our people fear and hate foreigners, they cannot hate us.\" –Comrade Picard BearFrog gave a sigh as he exited out of the report and entered the next one. \"What did it say?\" asked Turtle Man. \"It pretty much told hold the Soviets entered every political office to make take-over easy and it also gave some ideas they had for government and took control over China since they needed money for their debt and Russia was going to give it to them, but they had to unite with their government. It's pretty much the same as the old soviet, except there is now no German Soviet republic and no Berlin wall but they've made up for it by making the Great Wall of China act like that.\" \"Why?\" \"To keep people contained.\" \"Anything else?\" \"Besides ending with an evil quote, no.\" While BearFrog began reading the next document, Bob nestled in her soft bed and fell to sleep while Rocky and Apollo sat up watching a big fight that was known as \"SuperFight 2\". \"And that's the end of that round! This doesn't look good for Apollo Creed. Now for Round 5. Bam! What a block. Creed is blocking Rocky's punches. His arms seem to be glowing! Pinnicle's punches seem to be glowing too! Some of them are getting through Apollo's blocking. OOO! Rocky took a big blow to the head. Dang, Apollo's fist looked like it was on fire!\" \"I feel like I'm getting punched just watching this.\" Rocky said. \"Mama Mia, what did you have in those gloves Mountain? Bricks?\" asked Apollo. \"Hey Apollo, can I ask you something?\" \"Yeah sure.\" Said Apollo who was focusing more on the fight than on Rocky's voice. \"Apollo, about this fight against the Russian. Do you think maybe…it isn't against him?\" \"If it isn't against him then who is it against?\" asked Apollo jocundly. \"I dunno. Maybe like you against you?\" \"You know I really think you are getting brain damage.\" \"Apollo, you're a great fighter but you aren't what you used to be. You don't want to believe it but maybe the show is over.\" \"Man, I'm not old! I've always been a fighter. \" \"Well, you haven't really had a big fight in a while. Maybe it's time to change.\" \"I don't want to change! We can't be born again, Mountain! I like who I am!\" \"I like who you are too, but you can't do that stuff anymore Apollo.\" Replied Rocky pointing at the screen. \"We've both weakened in peaceful times. We're changing. We're turning into regular people.\" \"Now that's where you're wrong, Mountain. You can't change what you really are. You and me, we don't even have a choice. You can't turn off and on like some radio. We have to be in the middle of the action cuz we're the warriors! If the warrior has no challenge then the warrior is better off dead. I'm asking you as a friend…stand by my side this one last time.\" \"You're a great talker Apollo. But when this is over…\" Rocky said with a grin. Apollo laughed. \"Man, I feel sorry for that guy. \" Rocky said as they gave each other five. The human development program shall create new super soldiers that do not require guns to combat. Many types of steroids are being used and modified until a super drug is made. But first heredity must be best so we unite best athletes to create best children. Drago's family has history of warriors. To test this we must have our first super warrior fight the greatest fighter in the world. \" \"I should've studied harder in Russian.\" BearFrog said to himself, getting annoyed with the Russian accented grammar. \"So what does this one mean?\" asked Turtle-Man. \"It means that they are making Drago act as a prototype super soldier, and they want to fight Rocky to test the power of him to see if this program is even worth it and also humiliate our country. If Drago wins they'll perfect their super soldier formula and begin finding ways of making more of it cheaply.\" BearFrog replied. \"Once they perfect one they'll begin mass-producing them.\" Many things are mass- produced, such as magazines. Many magazines about the Red Star vs Old Glory, Drago vs Apollo. Everyone seemed to have nicknames for them. One magazine had \"Superman vs Superhype\". There were many interesting cover stories like \"Las Vegas is the place for Apollo Creed's Gamble\". \"Mr. Creed, why do you feel the need to fight Drago?\" asked one reporter at the press conference. \"Let's just call it a sense of responsibility. I need to teach this newbie how to box!\" Apollo replied happily. \"Don't you think he's a little in-experienced to be in the same ring?\" \"Well, some folks just have to learn the haaard-way.\" Apollo told them, which got a laugh. \"Rocky, how do you think Apollo should fight Drago?\" \"Well…\" said Rocky, turning to look at Drago who was seated next to Apollo. \"I think the first thing Apollo needs is a ladder.\" The crowd laughed. \"Drago! How does it feel to spar with the great former champion?\" \"…\" Apollo looked at Drago and then the crowd and repeated the motion and followed it with \"The man's tongue didn't come through customs!\" which of course got a large hearty laugh from the reporters. \"My husband is very happy to have this opportunity. It's his dream.\" Ludmilla told the crowd. \"Dream?\" one reporter asked. \"In our country Apollo Creed is well known and very respected. It will be a good victory.\" \"Wait a minute. Win?\" Apollo asked. He looked up at Drago. \"You don't really think you're gonna whip me, do ya?\" \"We did not come here to lose.\" Ludmilla replied. \"You hold on, little lady, you hold on; Cuz lose and lose royally he's gonna do!\" \"How can you be so sure?\" \"Well, I've been with the best and I've beat the best. I've retired more men than social security.\" Apollo replied with laughter in his voice. \"Excuse me,\" the premier started, \"You are not very realistic, are you Mr. Creed?\" \"Where did you come from, what're you talking about?\" \"You can box, yes, but you have not fought or trained intensely for such a long time that it is impossible for you to win over Drago.\" \"Is that a fact?\" \"Yes, and it could be a very painful one.\" \"You put that heavybag with eyeballs in the ring and you're gonna see the meaning of pain!\" Apollo yelled as he pointed at Drago. \"Why do you insult us?\" Ludmilla asked. \"Don't make me out to be the bad guy. I came here to talk about a friendly exhibition bout until comrade bigmouth started in!\" \"It is you who is the aggressor, Mr. Creed!\" yelled the premier. \"I wish to say to the press, in all fairness, Drago should not even fight this man because he is a hasbin!\" \"You get that big chump in the ring right now! Come on!\" yelled Apollo as he got up and was held back by Rocky and Apollo's trainer, Tony. Drago pushed Apollo back, and Apollo was kept up from the crowd on his half of the table. \"We'll finish this in the ring.\" Said Apollo as he headed to the right to make his leave. \"How did I do?\" asked Apollo. \"A little loud for my taste.\" Replied Rocky. \"But good?\" \"Oh, yes. Very good.\" As they exited the building, Drago threw the life size cardboard picture of Apollo to the ground with no emotion in his face. We must destroy our greatest enemy, The United States of America. To do so we must weaken them in every possible way. We shall give them false intelligence reports that will cause them to enter a war for the wrong reasons and therefore be unable to initiate pre-emptive strikes ever again. To cause mass hysteria we shall create several powerful computer viruses and put them onto the internet. We shall also cause large blackout that will take out more than 3 states. We shall make them think their economy is weak when it is strong. We shall corrupt their officials with bribes so that our interests can be met. We shall slowly sink that nation into the state of being a hell on earth. \" We found them! \" yelled three Russian guards as they entered the room. BearFrog quickly punched all of them in the gut, knocking them out. \"We've stayed here too long. Come on, let's go Rap Master Turtle.\" \"Alright, let's boogey.\" Turtle Msn said as he and BearFrog both raised their right hands in the air and blasted a whole through the roof. \" We have no choice but to begin operation statue early. Those Americans must be destroyed. \" the premier said on his cell phone. \" But the public will notice it quickly. \" replied Comrade Picard, the musclebound gray haired crew-cut wearing former boxing superstar. \" I shall contact Rega and tell him to put out all of his viruses at once. The Americans will focus on that so much they will not notice a statue missing. They are so stupid they do not even realize how perfectly built it is, and why it will be such a powerful warrior when we bring it to life. \" After the conversation ended, the Russian Premier contacted Manuel Rega, the soviet's best virus maker. He told Rega to set loose his viruses and he did. John first noticed it while in an online game. The large man in green pants and a black shirt walked through the base holding his machine gun until he saw an explosion. He ran into the control room. One of them was a slim female with blonde hair, another was a large man with red hair, and the other two were average except one had green hair and the other one had a robotic eye and was bald. Psykloak1: What happen? Fargoth: Someone set up us the bomb Pirogoeth: We are getting a signal. Largo: I-I47? Scotty: Main Screen turn on Blip. The screen turned on to reveal… Psykloak1: It's you. Dingus: Hahaha, how are you gentlemen? Dingus: All your base are belong to us. Dingus: You are on the way to destruction. Scotty: What you say? Dingus: You have no chance to survive. Make your time. Hahaha. Psykloak1: Y Disconnected from server. Attempting to re-connect… Re-connection failed. \"GAH!\" screamed John. Suddenly the phone rang. John answered. \"John, Dingus has hacked into the game! He can control our characters! He wants me to relay a message!\" \"Go ahead.\" John said as he grabbed a notepad and a pen. \"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Thanks Scotty.\" John then went to which had been hacked and turned into a digital arena of sort. The page seemed to be nothing but a black background, green binary and a few words to click on. John clicked on Enter as was immediately sucked into his computer and on the webpage. \"I've been waiting.\" Dingus said with a smile. \"Tell me something, Dingus. You are not that skilled in hacking. How could you hack an online game and get past my firewall?\" \"Why don't we make a wager? If you win, I'll tell you and take off all of the viruses and tell you where I got them. If I win you will be put in a html document and remain there forever.\" \"So this is it, huh? Some one doesn't want me around.\" \"Wow, that is so impressive Mr. Computer Genius.\" \"Well, shall we begin?\" \"Let's.\" Dingus lunged forward and punched John in the gut, who fell down hard. John's face was suddenly green and his face seemed to morphing as if he was made of pixels and they were rotating. \"I have the advantage, John, for I have viruses while you have nothing.\" Said Dingus with a smirk. John replied by lunging a fist forward himself, only to miss and be kicked in the back by Dingus and landing hard of the invisible floor once again. Dingus then stomped on John, and that stomp made the invisible floor disappear. Well, for John at least. Dingus stood up high as John fell far down with only the numbers speeding by for eyes to see. Then Dingus jumped down as held his two arms fully extended above his head and gave John a hard blow to the back. After that John landed and was back on solid ground. Although was the only place you could enter the digital arena, every other website in the world had a live view of the action and even the crappiest computers could see the fight. \"John!\" yelled StevenGuy. Suddenly NiGhTmArE88288 also appeared. \"We've come to help, John!\" cried NiGhTmArE88288. \"Bob's Best Friend will be here in a minute!\" yelled GadoTheLion. \"No! I have to fight alone, otherwise Dingus won't tell me where he got the viruses!\" yelled John. \"But John-\" protested StevenGuy. \"Don't worry guys. I can handle him. Now leave.\" Said John as he pointed to a button that was labeled Exit. All three of them double tapped it and then vanished out of cyberspace and back to their homes. \"You have no chance to survive. Make your time. Hahaha.\" Dingus said maliciously. John smirked and then his face turned to that of a fight and charged with a loud battle cry. He threw a punch and Dingus dodged by sliding to left with his arms crossed. John attacked again and missed the annoying enemy. He was starting to feel sick from the infected virus and began losing pixels in random places, like parts of his hand would vanish. \"What's wrong, Johnny? Can't handle it? You cannot win, for I am the superior hackor!\" John threw a kick and missed. Dingus replied by saying \"lol\". Dingus was enjoying himself and John was in intense pain. Dingus then decided to have a little fun and hack John. He stuck his arm into John's chest where his heart would be, and his arm went straight through. No blood or anything, but intense pain for John as he felt his digital self become corrupt with more deadly data. \"AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!\" screamed John. He finally got the strength to jump backwards from the attack and clutched his shirt in the area where Dingus' arm had been. \"Come now, Jonathan. This can't be your best.\" Said Dingus with a smirk. \"Where are those amazing hacking skills I've heard so much about?\" \"You want to see my true power? Fine.\" Said John as he crossed his arms and began spinning very fast. When the spinning stopped, a ninja stood before Dingus. \"I am Xy63r N1nja!\" I:h:e:a:r:t:B:o:B , Zeldarulah and Bobs Best Friends all sat together in the Bob fanclub along with Triumph the Insult comic dog, in awe at the amazing transformation that was just made. \"PH34R M4I L33T H4XX0R P0W4!\" cried Xy63r N1nja as he took out his sword. \"Bah, you cannot defeat me with such a pathetic weapon.\" Said Dingus as he took out a glowing red katana. \"YAAAA!!\" \"Y4444!!\" The blades met each other in fury. They had blocked each other's attack. The same happened again and again. Then suddenly the l33t ninja jumped high into the air and seemingly stabbed the air. Suddenly the numbers were constantly changing. They began hitting Dingus, and it was painful. Dingus fell to the ground, defeated, after taking many blows from many tiny numbers. \"I 4m t3h h4ck1ng m4s74.\" Said the ninja as he twirled and turned back into John Psykloak. \"A deal is a deal, Dingus.\" \"Fine,\" Dingus began, \"A rival of the U.S. wanted me to stop you from getting on computers so that nobody could stop them. You're skills rival that of an entire nation's. In exchange for stopping you and putting the viruses on the net, I was supposed to be given the power I need to defeat Pinnicle.\" \"Which nation offered you this power and gave you your mission?\" \"It was the-\" Dingus began before a white arrow suddenly landed on him and a menu bar appeared. It slowly moved down to delete. Dingus ran to the exit and left with fear. John quickly followed the suit, not wanting to be deleted. The moment he exited, the hackers decided it would be safer just to shut down their operation. Thus did everything on the internet return back to the norm. Everyone was talking about the internet crisis, and nobody really seemed to notice that the statue of Rocky Pinnicle was missing. Not even Rocky himself noticed, because he, Bob and Tony were busy training with the former champion. Apollo was greatly admired on the internet for facing the big Russian. He was fighting with the odds against him. That is what motivated Apollo during his training. His determination was stronger than ever. \"ARRGH!\" screamed Apollo as he switched arms. How Rocky managed to do such an exercise was a mystery to him. Switching arms while doing one-armed sit-ups…madness. Yet, it was insane training that allows one to take on the toughest opponents. And Apollo knew Drago was tough. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Apollo hit the sandbag extremely fast and extremely powerfully. He punched and punched until his attack cut through the bag and a new was needed. Apollo began following the training that Rocky did when he trained for Apollo including drinking egg yolk and punching raw meat. Apollo was getting stronger than he ever was before. There were some problems Apollo had, though. He could not seem to move around as fast or as smoothly as he used to, which was his reason for winning most of his matches. Also, when sparring, he seemed to damage much more easily than before. Apollo said that he made up for it with his increased strength and his better knowledge of fighting, and focused on improving those aspects more. He did improve slightly in the areas he was doing bad in, but not a great increase. Apollo also spent a week at an army base and did training alongside the soldiers. He himself was a soldier. He was fighting the Soviet Union just as these men might be in a few short months. They all knew this and greatly encouraged Apollo themselves. Apollo then went to New York and began training on the streets there. Then one day he decided to test himself if he was truly ready. He ran. He ran so fast that he was running on the water that surrounded the island. He ran and then he began to climb the gigantic green woman. His arms hurt, his muscles snapped. He kept on climbing, and climbing, and climbing until he reached the nose. He slowly forced his arms to move upward, and promised himself not to use any Ki. His arms seemed to bleed inside but he kept going. He slowly climbed to the top of the torch and threw his hands in the air and screamed with victory. \"Damn it's bloody cold. I'm all out of ki so I can't build a fire or fly out here.\" BearFrog said out loud as he rubbed his hands together. \"I didn't know you were British.\" Turtle Man said as he rubbed to sticks together. It was snowing ferociously outside, but luckily they had found a cave. \"I'm not, I just tend to use their way of speaking often.\" \"Ah…\" said Turtle Man as he failed to start a fire. Let's move our focus across the world in Las Vegas. In front of the Grand Hotel, there was a gigantic yellow glowing sign that had Apollo Creed vs Ivan Drago written on it and underneath the names were the names of the countries, U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. \"Welcome one and all to the city of lights, Las Vegas and to one of the most unusual events in years.\" Said an announcer. The two giant cardboard pictures of the fighters looked at each other in front of a fountain outside the Grand Hotel, which was gleaming with lights inside and out. \"East meets West. Age versus Youth in a good will exhibition match between the former champion Apollo Creed and the mountain of muscle from the Soviet Union, Ivan Drago.\" In the building, Apollo was in his dressing room. He had received many fruit baskets and flowers from people telling him to kick the commie's butt. He was not going to let them down. He also had a picture of Drago on the mirror. He was in his yellow shorts with red trim (the same gear he would be in the fight they were about to have) however this one had black marker on him. Devils horns and smoke snorting out of his nose, glasses and even a tail. And in the corner of the picture the words \"Creed was here\". \"Chill out dude. You have to get your gear on. There, now you look like a mummy.\" \"I feel like a mummy. I feel great, like I could eat nails.\" Said Apollo as he hit his fist while looking in the mirror. \"I never tried those things. Bob has, though.\" \"Wha?\" \"Snails. You know, I've seen them around the garden and stuff bu-\" \"Not snails, mountain, NAILS. Na-Na-Na-Nails.\" \"Oh yeah…Apollo try to de me a favor. When you go up there try not to over-do it, okay? Don't wear yourself out.\" \"Wear myself out, yeah. Like I'm going to do that. You're making me sound like I'm an old man when I'm in the best shape of my life.\" Said Apollo with a smirk as he stretched in front of the mirror. \"Yeah but if it was me I wouldn't mind postponing a couple of weeks…We don't know anything about this guy, Apollo.\" \"Postpone? Alright let's say I postpone, then what? Some other guy will come and take out this chump and where will I be left?\" \"Apollo this is just an Exhibition fight. This doesn't mean anything.\" \"What do you mean this doesn't mean anything?! This is us versus them man! Look, you may not know now what I'm talking about, but you will when it's over. Believe me…you will when it's over!\" While Apollo was in his bright dressing room, Drago stood in ring. It was a dark room which was fairly empty, except for that of the ring, himself and a few other Russians. The premier's voice echoed as he spoke Russian very fast and the only word any English speaking person would understand was the last word he spoke… \"Ivan!\" yelled the premier as he pounded his fists together. Drago looked to his left to see the leader of his nation standing next to his wife. He stared at them until they began walking up the concrete ramp to head into the main area, where their seats were located. The room where the show was to take place was beautiful. The walls were bright red, but not too bright, and the people were seated at elegant tables, including Rocky's girlfriend and Apollo's wife, who he had just recently married and had given birth to twins. She had lost the weight from pregnancy and was now in good shape. Ludmilla and the premier decided to walk over to Apollo's wife and have a little pre-match chat. \"Good luck. I hope after we can be friends.\" Ludmilla said. \"I hope so.\" Said Apollo's wife with a bit of suspicion in her voice. \"Of course. They're sportsmen, not soldiers.\" Ludmilla replied as she extended a hand. Apollo's wife became a little more at ease with the statement and smiled as they shook hands. After Ludmilla and the premier told her to enjoy the match they sat down in their seats, surround be miniature flag waving Americans. Suddenly the ceiling opened up above Drago as he stood in the center of the ring. The light gleamed and made his already bright yellow coat brighter. He looked up at the light and music began to play as the ring was moved up by a mechanical device. Drago was too busy looking up to notice the circle of stars on the blue ring under him. Suddenly Drago heard a man give a scream. He didn't give it much notice as he was too busy looking at all of the other stuff. He was amazed with all the bright lights and costumed dancing people and the gigantic American flag behind him. The fake planes that were flying above were truly amazing. If he was an American, however, he'd be more amazed of the man who screamed. The man who screamed was standing in front of the ring with a microphone in his hand. He was the Godfather of Soul…James Brown. \"Superhighways! Coast to coast! Easy takin' , anywhere! On the transcontinental overload, just slide behind the wheel. How does it feel?\" sang James Brown. \"When there's no destination-\" sand the backup singers. \"That's too far! And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are! Ow!\" sang the godfather. BOOM! Smoke came of from the nose of the gigantic statue of an bull head, which was placed behind the ring. On top of it was somebody dressed in a red white and blue top hat, wearing similar trunks, boots, gloves and vest. \"Living in America!\" \"Eye to eye - station to station!\" It was Apollo Creed, doing a 'I Want You' sort of this at Drago, though it was a little more difficult to get since he had gloves on. \"Living in America! Hand in hand - across the nation!\" \"Living in America!\" \"Got to have a celebration! Rock my soul!\" Apollo got down from the bull and began to dance a little outside the ring as the song played. \"Smokestack - fatback - many miles of railroad track. All-night radio keep on runnin' through your rock'n' roll soul. All-night diners keep you awake on a black coffee and a hard roll!\" \"You might have to walk a fine line! You might take a hard line!\" \"But everybody's workin'…overtime!\" \"Living in America!\" \"Eye to eye - station to station....\" Apollo had gotten into the ring by the time that lyric was sang, and he once again did the 'I Want You' thing to Drago. \"I live in America - I live in America - wait a minute - You may not be lookin' for the promised land, But you might find it anyway! Under one of those old familiar names like; New Orleans!\" \"New Orleans!\" the crowd replied. \"Detroit City!\" \"Detroit City!\" \"Dallas!\" \"Dallas!\" \"Pittsburgh P. A.!\" \"Pittsburgh P. A.!\" \"New York City!\" \"New York City!\" \"Kansas City!\" \"Kansas City!\" \"Atlanta!\" \"Atlanta!\" \"Chicago and L. A.!\" \"Living in America! Hit me! - Living in America - Living in America. I live in America - staying alive - we'll make the prime. I live in America - hey I know what it means. Living in America - hit me - eye to eye - station to station. Living in America - so nice - would you better stop? Living in America - I feel good!\" The crowd cheered fiercely as James Brown bowed and a cape was put on him. A hopping Apollo stood next to Rocky Pinnicle and Tony Duke was Ivan Drago stood stiff next to Manuel Rega (trainer and l33t hacker/virus maker) and Sergi Rimski. Flag waved powerfully as Apollo was given a high five by James Brown who then headed to his seat. \"Ladies and Gentlemen if you're just joining us now we're about to witness one of the most interesting events in boxing for years. For the first time ever, East meets West in professional boxing.\" Said one commenter. \"Thanks for getting me here, Mountain.\" Apollo said as his hat and vest were removed. \"No, we're even.\" Replied Rocky. \"God I feel born again…\" \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" the ring announcer began, \"I would like to announce the presence of a true fighting champion who defines the word courage…Rocky Pinnicle!\" \"Excuse me for one second, would ya?\" Rocky asked Apollo. Apollo extended an arm forward as Rocky went to the center of the ring and waved to the crowd. \"Tonight's special event features two great athletes! In the blue corner, weighing 221 pounds, former Heavyweight Champion of the World, the King of Sting, the Master of Disaster, the Count of Mounte Fisto, the-\" \"Think you got enough nicknames?\" Rocky asked Apollo. \"Patience, Mountain. Almost done.\" Replied Apollo with a smirk. The crowd cheered intensely as Apollo raised his arms in the air and spun around a bit. \"In the blue corner, weighing an even 261 pounds, the undefeated World Amateur Champion from the Soviet Union, the Siberian bull, Ivan Drago!\" The crowd reaction was the exact opposite of Apollo's. The crowd booed as they waved their American flags and the visiting soviets felt uneasy in their seats. The two fighters moved the middle of the ring and listened to the rules. \"Shake hands and let's have a good fight.\" Said the ref. \"Alright, it's time to go to school.\" Apollo said with a smirk as he winked at his teammates in the corner. Drago remained to have a blank expression on his face. \"What, do you need an interpreter? Put your hands up!\" yelled Apollo as he lifted up Drago's hands and hit them. They did not move. \"You will lose.\" Drago said quietly. He then smacked Apollo's hands, which fell quickly. \"The bad blood between these two can be felt all over this arena.\" Said one commenter. \"I just can't get over the size of this Russian.\" Said the other as Drago's robe was removed and underneath it was his yellow shorts with a red soviet symbol on it. \"It's showtime! It's showtime! It's showtime!\" Apollo yelled at the crowd. \"Excuse me. Are you forgetting something?\" asked Rocky as he held up the mouthpiece. Apollo gave a faint laugh as it was put into his mouth. \"Be back in a minute, alright?\" Apollo asked jocundly as the bell rang. The two fighters moved to the center of the ring. Apollo began circling around Drago and threw a light left. Drago moved forward as Apollo circled him and threw another quick left. Apollo then gave out two quick lefts and Drago walked backwards after getting hit. Apollo then moved forward but tripped. He managed to catch himself before he fell and then went back to moving on the Russian. \"This is bizarre. Creed is over the hill, and the Russian hasn't done anything yet.\" Said one commenter. Creed gave a strong left to the Russian and then a one-two combo. After that the Russian began moving forward and the yank began to retreat. He quickly moved forward and attacked Drago before moving backwards again. Apollo continued to attack but Drago began blocking Apollo's punches. \" Now Drago! \" yelled Sergi Rimski in Russian. Drago gave a powerful right hand to Apollo which knocked him backwards against the ropes. Drago began beating on the man viciously but solidly. \"Tie him up!\" yelled Rocky. Apollo did as he was told and embraced the Russian in a hug like position but was spun around and thrown into the far corner. Drago then continued began on Creed. The bell then rang, but Drago gave Apollo five extra punches for the road. Both sides of trainers went into the ring. Rocky carried Apollo away as Tony Duke yelled at the Russians. \"What the hell are you guys doing?! This is supposed to be an exhibition bout!\" Apollo blood began dripping on Rocky's white shirt. Rocky looked at Apollo's deformed face as he set him down on a seat in his corner. \"Champ, I've got to call the fight! You can't do any more out there!\" \"N-No…\" Apollo said faintly. \"He's killing ya! I've got to stop this fight.\" \"Rocky…as a friend…promise me you won't stop this fight…\" \"The Soviet's strength is incredible!\" yelled one commenter. \"You don't stop this fight…no matter what…\" said Apollo as he got up. His mouthpiece was put in. \"No matter what…\" Apollo turned to his wife, who face had gotten pale and her eyes bulging. He raised his arm slightly and gave a faint smile and then turned to face the Russian again. The bell had rung. Apollo began dancing a bit as he moved. He threw some punches at Drago, but all of them missed. None of them made contact with Ivan Drago's face. Then Drago countered with a right to the head. The blow caused blood and sweat to fly. Apollo tried to counter but missed. Then Drago continued attacking. Apollo was slowly being destroyed by the soviet soldier. Rocky ran and picked up the towel and looked into the ring. \"NO!\" yelled Apollo. Drago became more and more ruthless with his blows. He picked the places where the former champ would feel the most pain. He tortured him in the ring which was now red white and blue because of Apollo's blood dripping onto to it. \"Stop the fight!\" pleaded Apollo's wife from the crowd. Rocky listened and almost threw the towel until he heard Apollo yell \"NO!\" again. He grabbed the towel back before it slipped from his hands. Apollo's slaughter was continued. Ivan Drago would not let up on his attack. Apollo kept standing though. Even though it seemed like each blow would be his last he refused to give up. He was not going to give up…He was not going to lose…no matter what… \"Throw the damn towel!\" yelled Tony. \"NO!\" yelled Apollo. Rocky threw the towel in the ring one second to late. Drago gave his final punch of the match. The most powerful blow Apollo had ever felt had hit him. Drago moved backwards as he let Apollo's body fall to the ground. Rocky and Tony rang into the ring as Apollo's entire body twitched once. Soon many members of the press entered the ring and surround Apollo and Drago who was now draped in a Soviet flag. \"Somebody get a doctor!\" Rocky yelled frantically. \"Is he dead?\" asked one reporter. \"Get back! Give him some air!\" yelled Rocky. \"You're gonna be okay champ. Just hold on…hold on…\" Apollo's wife tried to get through but the mass of the media would not allow her to see her husband alive again. She did get to hear the voice of the man who killed him, however, since he was being interviewed. \"I cannot be defeated…I defeat all man…\" Drago said to the crowd. \"Creed is motionless! This is absolute pandemonium.\" Said one commenter. \"Soon…I defeat real champion…\" \"What started out as a joke has turned into a disaster!\" yelled one of the commenters. \"If he dies, he dies…\" Rocky looked at Apollo's head in his hands and then realized that his friend was dead. Dead. Gone. He was gone forever and never coming back. Then Rocky's gaze shifted. He looked into the big blue eyes of Ivan Drago… --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It was a bright and sunny day at the graveyard. Apollo's grave was covered in flowers, and his family and friends surrounded it. Rocky wore a dark suit with black sunglasses and yet somehow still felt cold under the heat of the sun. \"There's a lot I could say about this man. I don't know if it matters now…I guess what matters is what he lived for…and what he died for. We always did everything the way you wanted it,\" Rocky said as a tear began to stream down his cheek, \"I didn't understand that but…now I understand…we'll never forget you Apollo…\" Rocky then grabbed his title belt gently and placed it on the grave. Rocky had given the belt to Apollo, a real champion. \"You're the best,\" Rocky said as he slowly walked away from the grave with the others as the gold icon on the belt gleamed in the bright sun… \"Rocky, has a champion ever given up the title before?\" asked one reporter at the press conference. \"I don't know…\" Rocky replied faintly. There was going to be a lot of questions. Why didn't the boxing commission sanction the fight? Where was the fight going to be held? Does this mean war with the Soviets? \"With Rocky's known punching power, do you still think this is going to be an easy fight?\" asked a reporter. \"Yes of course. It is a matter of science. This man has neither the size nor the genetics to win. Drago is the most perfect human being ever created.\" Replied the premier. \"There's been no mention of this yet, but how much are you making for the fight?\" asked one reporter. \"No money.\" Replied Rocky. \"Has the fight date been set yet?\" \"December 25th.\" \"Why Christmas?\" \"That's what I was told.\" \"Where is the match taking place?\" \"Moscow.\" \"Are you nuts?!\" asked Maci who was sitting next to Rocky. \"Why did you agree to this?\" Cat asked. \"We fight in Soviet Union only! Tell them why, Ludmilla.\" The premier demanded. \"I fear for my husband's life. We receive threats of violence everywhere we go. You call him a killer but he is a professional sportsmen. You have this belief that you are so very good and we are so very bad. You have this belief that you are better than us.\" \"It is all just lies and propaganda used to support this violent and antagonistic government!\" yelled the premier. \"Whoa! Violent? We don't keep our people behind a wall with machine guns!\" yelled Maci. \"Who are you?\" asked the premier. \"I'm an average American citizen, that's who!\" yelled Maci, which got a laugh from the crowd. \"We've had enough! We go!\" yelled the premier as he got up from his seat and began to leave. While the crowd of reporters followed them and Rocky, Taarin was being followed by a media swarm. All of them were asking questions about Rocky and her going to Russia, which she had no idea about. She ran into her house and eventually the reporters left. Hours later in that same driveway, a DeLorean parked itself in the driveway. Out if it came Rocky who went inside his girlfriend's house to find her waiting for him. \"Rocky?\" \"Yeah?\" \"You alright?\" \"Alright.\" \"Why'd you do it?\" \"I just gotta do what I gotta do.\" \"You don't have to do anything.\" \"No Taarin, I do. And…I have to leave too…\" \"So…where are you going?\" \"They said they were going to let me train in Russia. I just want to go to a place where I won't think about anything but him.\" \"Rocky…give it some time. A lot of people deal with hurt.\" \"A lot of people don't have a choice but I do.\" \"So…you're willing to throw away everything? Before there were reasons I could understand but I can't understand this. Even if you win what have you won? Apollo's still gone…Why can't you change you're thinking? Everybody else does!\" \"Because I'm a fighter! We can't change what we are.\" \"Yes we can…\" \"No we can't change anything! We can only go with what we are.\" \"Have you read the papers?! You've seen how strong he is! It's suicide! You can't win!\" Suddenly it felt like Rocky's heart exploded. He looked at Taarin weakly and tried to talk. \"Taarin…Taarin always tells the truth. Maybe I can't win. Maybe all I can do is take everything he's got. But to beat me, he's going to have to kill me. And to kill me, he has to have the heart to stand and fight me. And to do that, he has to be willing to die himself.\" Rocky said as he slowly walked out the door. Rocky then entered his car and began to drive out in the streets. Although he was driving, his eyes could not see the road. He drove with his subconscious because his conscious mind saw Drago in fighting stance. His hair was down and he looked more raw and natural. More powerful than before. He was surround be darkness and he seemed to disappear in flashes like lightning bolts and re-appear just as quick. He came closer with each flash. We're not indestructible, baby better get that straight I think it's unbelievable how you give into the hands of fate Drago gave Apollo a punishing blow against the ropes. The fight was beginning to replay in Rocky's mind. He wiped away a tear as it continued. Some things are worth fighting for some feelings never die Rocky looked out the window. It was dark and damp to everybody else but he saw a bright and sunny beach. Apollo and him were racing. This time Rocky won and they celebrated with a victory hug. I'm not askin' for another chance I just wanna know why A scrambled montage of the fight and memories of Apollo began going through Rocky's mind. There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out Giving in can't be wrong Suddenly his thoughts began wander. He stopped thinking about Apollo and the fight and began thinking about good memories with his friends and Taarin. I don't wanna pasify you I don't wanna drag you down but I'm feelin like a prisoner like a stranger in a no named town I see all the angry faces afraid that could be you and me talkin about what might have been I'm thinkin about what I used to be Rocky thought about the fight between Taarin and him and tried to ignore those images in his head. He had to focus on Apollo and Drago. He could not get distracted. His mind began to play a jumble of memories, now just about Taarin and the fight. There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out Giving in can't be wrong The memories of Drago almost diminished entirely and the memories became of the good times with his friends. He remembered the time he sold Dinosaur capsules as drugs to get money for the site. He remembered when he cut off his hand to do his art homework. He remembered when John dressed up as Xy63r N1nja and had a hostile takeover. Baby,baby we can shed this skin we can know how we feel inside instead of goin' down and endless road not knowin if we're dead or alive But Some things are worth Fighting for Some feelings never die I'm not askin for another chance I just wanna know why Rocky used all of his will-power to end all of the happy thoughts. He now was focused on the blow that killed Apollo. As Apollo fell in his mind, he fell. He fell alongside Apollo as if they were one. Part of him died with Apollo. All tears he might have had in him turned to stone. He was going to be strong. The flashing Drago appeared in his mind again. His mind was now focused on the task at hand. There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out Giving in , giving in can't be wrong no There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy , no easy, no easy way out There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out Giving in , giving in can't be wrong no There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy , no easy, no easy way out There's no easy way out There's no shortcut home There's no easy way out… \"There's no easy way out of this mess…\" BearFrog said angrily as he rubbed his hands together. \"Well, at least we have a fire.\" Turtle Man said happily. BearFrog looked down at the tiny spark Turtle Man called a fire. Suddenly, the wind blew it out. \"GAH!! How can it possibly get worse?!\" yelled BearFrog. \"Hello boys.\" Said Comrade Picard (using a megaphone), who was standing outside in the middle of a blizzard with about five hundred soldiers. \"D'oh!\" yelled Turtle Man and BearFrog at the same time. The two cold Americans exited the caves and stared at the miniature army. Then gave weak glances at each other and then BearFrog ripped off his shirt and put a belt of bullets over his chest. He then picked up a nearby machine gun which they had found out of in the cold. Turtle Man began to scream loudly. His eyes bulged as he scream and the earth beneath him shook. All of the soldiers felt this force and some of them walked backwards slightly and then ran. Without even looking, Comrade Picard shot all of them with his handgun. Turtle Man's muscles grew. His shirt was destroyed by the ki surrounding him (though his pants were fine). Suddenly his left arm became very big. He reached into it and pulled out a huge sword. The transformation was not done yet. His hair grew longer and his face suddenly had blue makeup on it. \"Let's get em.\" Said Turtle Man with an Irish accent. \" Attack! \" yelled Comrade Picard. The soldiers obeyed and ran towards BearFrog and Turtle Man in the cold snow. \"Freedom!\" yelled Turtle Man. Bullets were flying as BearFrog shot his gun. No soldiers were killed by BearFrog, but some of their guns were disabled, including Picard's. Turtle Man, however, just began hacking and slashing through the soldiers while BearFrog did his mercy shooting. \" Cease Fire! \" yelled Picard. He approached BearFrog and Turtle Man who have stopped attacking. \"You are quite impressive, American. What is your name?\" \"BearFrog.\" \"Ah, an alias. How nice. I am Comrade Picard.\" \"Comrade Picard…Hey! Aren't you that Russian former boxing champion?\" asked Turtle Man. \"Yes, I am. Now I am a commanding officer in the new Soviet Union. I would like to know where you got your abilities.\" \"Rocky taught every customer who bought a Bob shirt how to control ki energy and-\" Turtle Man began before BearFrog hit Turtle Man in the back of his neck and knocked him out. \"So where did Mr. Pinnicle learn how to use ki?\" BearFrog turned around, ignoring the question. He walked over to outside the cave and picked up his yellow jacket. He dusted off the snow and put it on as he walked back toward Picard and picked up Turtle Man. \"I'm not telling you anything. I have enough ki to fly to Japan and I'm leaving so if you'll excuse me…\" said BearFrog as he tried to walk around, but the Soviet stepped in front of him. \"I shall let you pass if you can defeat me in combat.\" \"Well, a fight sounds like fun,\" said BearFrog as he made a fire using ki and placed TM next to it, \"Alright, bring it.\" The Russian began to power up like they did previously. His muscles bulged and his shirt ripped off in the process, showing a surprisingly powerful figure. \"Oh .\" POW! BearFrog took a punch right to the kisser. He spun around before hit the ground. Picard tried to lift up BearFrog by his legs, but BearFrog kicked Picard in the gut to counter. Kick! Block! Punch! Block! Each move they tried on each other the other blocked. Some soldiers took out their guns but the captain told them to stand down. The two entered a grapple, with neither budging and inch. Then BearFrog got a smart idea. He kicked Picard in the place where families are made. Picard jumped back in pain, and BearFrog then began his assault on Picard. All of his blows damaging, all of them full of ki. With one final kick, Picard was launched back twenty feet into the snow. \"Impressive…\"said Picard as he pushed himself up. \"But let us see how you face our new secret weapon… Come out Rocky Statue!\" A small gray box that a soldier was holding was set on the ground. Suddenly it began to grow, with a form shaping as it grew. Then the look-alike of Rocky Pinnicle stood before everyone. It slowly walked towards BearFrog. BearFrog grinned and charged toward it. BAM! A powerful punch to the head! The statue had attacked BearFrog so fast he didn't even see it. He shook off his headache and gave a very powerful punch to the statue's chest, The statue simply stood motionless, as did BearFrog. They stood in that position. BearFrog began to walk back in fear and then faced another punch, this time to the gut. \"Gah…what am I gonna do?\" BearFrog asked himself as he fell next to TM. Suddenly he heard something that nobody else seemed to notice. He gave a wide grin and then got up smirking. He put Turtle Man over his shoulder's and then gave a finger gesture to all of the Russians. ZOOM! A plane appeared overhead. BearFrog flew up to it as fast as he could and punched a hole in the plane. He arrived in the cargo area and gave a sigh of relief as he flew away from his Russian rivals. Now they could get some warmth and relax as they flew… \" They got away! Now how are we supposed to find out how they gained ki knowledge! \" \"Ahem!\" said a voice. \" You! \" yelled Picard. \"Yes, me. I was the private hacker you hired.\" Said Dingus with a smirk. \"Yes…we destroyed your computer, Mr. Dinguson.\" \"Yes, but I myself have ki knowledge because I stalked Rocky and learned from him teaching others. We have a long standing rivalry between us. As does my friend here…\" said Dingus as he extended an arm. Behind him was a stranger in a cloak. He threw it off to reveal Kermit The Frog! The statue walked towards them but Picard put his arm in front of the statue, who stopped. \"Mr. Picard, contact your premier. I think we can work to reach both of our goals…\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ZOOM! The plane was about to land. The place was surrounded with soldiers, staring at the plane without any emotion at all. Two worlds collide Rival nations It's a primitive clash Venting years of frustrations. Bravely we hope Against all hope There is so much at stake Seems our freedom's up Against the ropes… Does the crowd understand? Is it East versus West Or man against man Can any nation stand alone? Two Russian eagerly await the Americans to exit the plane. They sit still in a car, as another Russian waits outside of it. He is wearing a suit similar to that a detective would wear in old movies, complete with hat but he had a funny mustache to go with the look. In front of him was another car which looked just like the one he was leaning on. The plane door opened and the door, which had steps on it touched the ground. Bob stepped out, fully covered with winter clothing. In the burning Heart Just about to burst There's a quest for answers An unquenchable thirst In the darkest night Rising like a spire In the burning heart The unmistakable fire \"What an awful flight over here. So this is Russia? Don't look so tough, eh Rock?\" said Bob as she stepped off the plane. Tony Duke then stepped out of the plane and looked up to see the Soviet flag waving. The flag seemed so…evil…so…powerful… It gave him chills, which made the freezing cold Siberia much more cold. The others exited and felt the same chills, though not on the level Tony felt them. Then Rocky exited. He looked around the fort and saw that all the soldiers were looking at him. He got off the plane and the two cars approached. The mustached man exited the car and approached Rocky. \"Mr. Pinnicle, Drasvitiah. We take you to quarters now. Please enter car.\" Said the man with a powerful Russian accent. \"Hey when does the sun come up? This is bad for my sinuses.\" Said John. \"The weather changes from hour to hour. Get used to it. Get in car now, we have very long trip.\" \"Are we all going to fit?\" asked Cat as they walked towards the cars. \"If we don't Bob gets to go because the other people are more stupid than Bob…stupid.\" BearFrog (who had been sleeping) just woke up. He thought he heard Bob's voice. He jumped out of the plane with TM and saw them entering the cars. BearFrog decided he would fly above them as they traveled so he could see what was going on because he didn't want to risk causing a scene. He was, however, cold. So was TM (presumably) so BearFrog \"borrowed\" a few uniforms from soldiers who were suddenly \"tied up\". In the warriors code There's no surrender Though his body says stop His spirit cries - never! Deep in our soul A quiet ember Know it's you against you It's the paradox That drives us on The cars arrived in a snowy village in which the snow was three feet high. The cars stopped in front of an old house that had a man standing on the porch with a block of wood. He lived in the house and \"volunteered\" to have the Americans stay there as guests. BearFrog decided to land behind the house and he then snuck up to the side so he could hear what they were saying. It's a battle of wills In the heat of attack It's the passion that kills The victory is yours alone In the burning Heart Just about to burst There's a quest for answers An unquenchable thirst In the darkest night Rising like a spire In the burning heart The unmistakable fire Everyone got out of the cars except for the two Russian men who were in the cars earlier. \"Like you request, yes?\" asked the mustached man. \"You requested this dump?\" asked Bob. \"Yeah.\" Replied Rocky. \"Why? Are you planning to grow some reindeer?\" \"I just want to get away from everything.\" \"Then why'd you bring us along?\" \"Moral support during the match.\" \"The equipment you requested is in there.\" Said the mustached man as he pointed to an ice covered barn. \"Who are they?\" Rocky asked as he pointed at the two Russians in the car. \"They are official chaperones. They go where you go.\" \"This is below human standard. Not even the U.S. is this bad.\" Maci commented. \"You gotta complain Rocky! There's no internet here! We'll crack out here!\" John said in a panicked voice. \"You mean YOU'LL crack out here.\" Said James with his arms folded. \"Shaaaaa…\" \"Does he ever have any other dialogue in a BearFrog fanfic?\" asked Cat. \"You have everything I have been instructed to provide. Das Vidanyah.\" Said the mustached man as he entered the car and then drove off. \"Well, ready to do some sparring?\" asked John. \"I don't think I need it anymore, John.\" Replied Rocky. \"No sparring, no t.v., no squirrelies to kill…what a depressing vacation.\" Said Bob as she hoped on top of the snow and began to walk around when suddenly it caved in under her and she screamed \"WOOOAAHH!\" Boot was kind enough to pick up Bob and then hold the cat in his arms as they followed the others into the house. \"What am I gonna do? Somebody has to watch the forums! The place won't last if I'm not there for a long period of time!\" \" Don't worry, \" Boot began, \" I left somebody in charge who is very similar to you. \" \"Phew! That's a relief! Thanks Boot! I hope whoever you got can last while I make a laptop. I can't believe I forgot it again!\" said John as he walked off. \"So…who'd you get?\" asked Cat. \" John's clone. \" Elsewhere in America, John's clone is typing on the forums using John's account. \"htat is stupid you is banned now1\" Elsewhere in the same country, I:h:e:a:r:t:b:o:b is wondering why he just got banned from NC forums. Now let's turn our attention back to Russia. It is now nighttime. BearFrog and Turtle Man are hiding in a closet, waiting for a chance to talk to Rocky or somebody alone. Bob slept soundly by the fireplace while Cat listened to an Alvin & The Chipmunks C.D. Chad was sleeping, John was making a laptop out of wood, Boot was resting, James was eating a live pig, P.J. was roasting marshmallows by the fire, and Maci was watching Tony play chess with their Russian host. \"Check-mate my friend.\" Tony said. The Russian knocked over the white king and then Tony headed upstairs where Rocky was unpacking. He was setting up photos in the mirror like he had at home, surrounded by pictures of good times with his friends. One photo, however, was of an enemy. He put up a black and white newspaper clipping of Ivan Drago up on the mirror. Knock, Knock, Knock. \"Hey champ. Can I come up?\" asked Tony. \"Yeah sure.\" Replied Rocky. Tony walked up the stairs and entered the room. \"How are you doing?\" asked Tony. \"Pretty good.\" \"Some kind of weather we're having up here, huh?\" \"Yeah, it's pretty rough.\" \"To prep for what you gotta do it's good. Toughen you up.\" Said Tony with a smile. His tone changed suddenly. \"I know you're going to have to do almost everything alone up here, but you know I'll be with you.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"Apollo was like my son…I raised him. And when he died…part of me died…\" \"Apollo's dead?!\" BearFrog thought to himself as he waited in the closet for the best moment to exit. \"But now…you're the one…You're the one that's gonna keep his spirit alive…You're the one that's gonna make sure he didn't die for nothin'. Now you're going to have to go through hell. Worse than any nightmare you ever dreamed…but in the end…I know you'll be the last one standing.\" \"Thanks Tony.\" Said Rocky as they gave each other a hug. \"I'll try…\" Tony left the hug. \"You know what you've got to do. Do It. Do It…\" Tony then went downstairs. Rocky was unpacking his clothes when BearFrog fell out of the closet, in the Russian uniform covered by his yellow jacket. \"Hey Rocky. What's up?\" BearFrog asked. \"Why are you in a Siberian house closet wearing Russian uniforms with Turtle Man?\" asked Rocky. \"You know that's a good question. It's a long story and-\" \"Hey Rocky, we're out of marshmallows and…hey BearFrog. What's up?\" asked P.J. \"We-\" \"Hey guys!\" yelled P.J. \"BearFrog and Turtle Man are here!\" Suddenly everybody arrived upstairs, including the Russian man. \"You are friends with Soviet soldiers?\" asked the Russian. \"Uhh…yeah. Hey, could you please leave the room. We need to talk to them.\" Said John. \"Sure.\" Said the Russian man as he headed downstairs and closed the door. He then put his head next to it. \"In the U.S.S.R., they encourage people to spy on their neighbor and I doubt they would discourage spying on Americans.\" John told the group. \"Just like America.\" Maci commented. \"So what have you two been up to?\" asked Cat. \"That's what I asked them when I found them in the closet.\" Rocky told the group. \"Hey, isn't that illegal?\" \"No, MARRIAGE is illegal and that's in the U.S. I'm not sure about the Soviet's policy on the issue but they're too busy killing their own citizens.\" John told the group. \"Just like America.\" Maci chimed in. \"Hey, at least we're doing something about it unlike the Soviets! Show some patriotism Maci!\" \"I do have American pride, just not in the current America.\" \"At least Bush is trying to improve the nation!\" \"I really hope he loses in the election. I think it's tonight, right?\" \"Yes it is and I hope he wins. That way he'll save the lives of all the unborn babies.\" \"Yes, and kill the innocent people on death row and put our country into utter turmoil.\" \"Whoa, guys! Easy on the politics! We don't want BearFrog to start his sarcastic political humor.\" Said Bob. \"Shaaaaa….\" Said Chad. \"I agree. And get better dialogue.\" Said Cat. \"Oh man, I hate that.\" Said P.J. \"Too evil for me.\" Said James. \"Alright! BearFrog, give us the 411 on what's going on here.\" Rocky ordered BearFrog. \"Well, it all started when I took a trip to China…\" While BearFrog told his comrades about his adventures, the enemies of Rocky were sitting down with the premier, who had a gigantic glass window behind him. On the other side was an indoor track where Ivan was running laps. \"Why would I let you attack Rocky Pinnicle? He will be fighting in an important match against Ivan.\" The premier told them. \"Mr. Kotoff, you want to learn if the legends are true, yes? Rocky Pinnicle is the key. If we figure out how he learned to use his ki..nehahaha…ki…key…get it? Nyahahaha…Anyway, we just want to kill Rocky. We can get the info out of him and then dress up stoney here to look like Rocky.\" Said Kermit as he pointed at the statue. \"He has a good point sir. We did steal it for situations like that and this could make the fight much easier.\" Picard told his premier. \"Yes, but you should keep Drago training because failure is very possible, especially with all of his friends around.\" Dingus commented. \"You will not fail, but we shall push Drago to the limit because the statue might attack and his strength increases every day. But do not worry, the Soviet Union will make sure that you do not fail. Gentlemen, follow me.\" Said the premier as he got up. \" Sir! \" yelled one soviet soldier as he entered the room. \" We found the Americans! They are with Pinnicle and his comrades! \" \" Even more reason to attack them! We have to kill them before our secrets are let out! They have probably told the Pinnicle team so we must get them! \" yelled Picard angrily, who wanted to kill BearFrog. \" Yes, I agree! To the labs! \" yelled Kotoff, Ruler of The Soviet Union. Now it is time to once again shift our focus elsewhere. We return to the upper room of the Siberian home in which BearFrog was telling the story. \"So you dressed up like Rambo and Braveheart?\" asked John. \"Yes we did, Johnny.\" Said BearFrog in a voice imitating the colonel from Rambo. \"It really made sense at the time but I later realized that it was Siberia and very, very cold. That's why we took the uniforms after we got off the plane and also to try to look less suspicious.\" \"That would be a good plan had you not had the yellow jacket on over the uniform.\" Maci said. \"Dude…Aside from my Bob shirt, which is very comfortable and sold at a great price, it is the only piece of awesomely cool clothing I own!\" \"Why not buy more Bob shirts?\" suggested Bob. \"Hey, that's a great idea. In fact, I think I'll get some other great an inexpensive Neptune Circle merchandise too!\" said BearFrog as he turned and winked at nobody. \"Guys, this is all very interesting but I have to get up early and train so…\" Rocky began. \"Alright, we got it. You have to train so you can kick some commie butt!\" BearFrog yelled excitedly. \"BearFrog, kindly shut up.\" Bob said to BearFrog. BearFrog did. He realized that Rocky had to do this alone, without joy. He had to go through the most difficult training of his life for his most difficult fight. The group went downstairs and got themselves settled in and gave a brief excuse to the Russian man (very brief as BearFrog knew little of the language) and they all went to sleep (except for Turtle Man who was still knocked out). The group left Rocky alone in the room to gather his thoughts once more and to prepare for training. He looked down at the newspaper clipping intensely for a long time before finally going to bed. He got up with the sun the next day… It was a cold morning in Siberia, as most Siberian mornings are, but this morning was calm and cool. There was no wind, simply the utter silence of nature. Rocky got up right away, in his mountain training gear and looked out to see his Russian chaperones. Rocky walked across the snow yard and began jogging in the street with the Russians following behind by car. As he ran the neighbors watched him: an old man and his wife, a young child and his mother, and their spy of a host who reported the incident involving BearFrog to the government. Rocky, however, was just there to train. He ran along the street, almost causing a carriage to crash, but jogged swiftly enough to avoid an accident. The two Russians spied on Rocky with their binoculars to see what this \"special training\" would be. Machines everywhere were monitoring Ivan Drago's performance. He was on a machine that simulated climbing, and it was quite similar to a treadmill. This, however, was much more intense. He had to climb with his arms too, or nothing would happen. He had been doing this exercise for hours and was getting quite sweaty. As he did that, Rocky was running up the slopes of steep, snowy hills. He too had been running for hours, but had not the convenience of a warm room. Rocky ran across the small and freezing cold creek, and some of the painful water splashed onto his legs. But he kept on running, as did Drago. In their training headquarters there was an area where Drago would run laps on a mat-like setting. As he wore the tight white suit, he punched the speed bag when he passed each time, marking a new lap. Rocky didn't punch the air at the end of a lap, he just simply kept running up the stream (in it still, I might add). He wanted to reach the end of the stream and see what was there. Ivan moved his thick legs up and down and up and down in rhythmic fashion, as he did with moving his arms from in to out. It was a need training style that the scientists concluded would produce highly impressive results. Taking the advice of the scientists, Kotoff forced Drago to take this intense training as his lovely wife watched. Whilst Drago did that, Rocky was busy helping the man in the carriage, who had gotten stuck later. Rocky helped him get the carriage out of the snow and then continued on with his training of running in the freezing cold. Speed is important. That was surely known in the room with red lighting as Ivan was spinning the wheel with the poles extending out of it. Ivan turned this instrument as opposed to the speed-bag Rocky was using because this instrument could measure his speed, and also increase other muscle areas that speed-bag training does not usually result in. Bam! Rocky smashed the speed-bag flat with a furious final punch before moving onto his next part of training: Every-day life. In Siberia, it's cold all the time. Rocky went outside during a snow storm to chop wood for his friends inside the cabin. It was hard moving the saw back and forth on the large log with the strong winds, but he did it. He did it with the Russians watching. Russians were watching Ivan too. Slowly the large barbells he was lifting got larger. More weight was added on. As was true with Rocky as he threw logs into the wheel-barrow. The logs were getting harder and harder to move, as was the same for Drago lifting the weights. Clarance sat on the sled in the freezing cold snow-storm as Rocky got down on his hands and knees and tried moving the sled forward, giving it all he had. Drago did a similar exercise, only he was pulling nothing. He was just moving his arms and legs back and forth on a machine that did the same exercise. Both men struggled to push forward, but they did. They did not stop. Rocky was doing pull-ups in the barn. Now with his jacket off and white muscle-shirt on, he pulled himself up the hanging log that was on a fairly loose piece of rope. It rotated slowly as Rocky did this exercise and made it all the more difficult. Tony, John and BearFrog watched in awe as Rocky kept up his training. After that, at nightfall, he went outside (in his full winter clothing) and punched at the air and then picked up and large log and put it behind his shoulders. He then began to walk in the deep snow, carrying his cross. Bam! Drago smashed his sparring partner with a punch! Chink! Rocky hit the axe against the tree to chop down wood! Bam! Chink! Bam! Chink! Bam! Chink! Tiiiiimmbeerr!! Both the tree and the sparring partner fell to the ground, accepting defeat. After that, Rocky went back to his jogging. When he got back to the cabin a surprise awaited him. Taarin. \"I couldn't stay away anymore…I missed you.\" Said Taarin softly. \"I missed you.\" Replied Rocky. \"I'm with you, no matter what.\" \"No matter what.\" \"No matter what…\" Rocky and Taarin gave one-another a heart-felt kiss in the freezing cold, and thus did their lips stick together for quite some time (though not due to the cold.) Bang! This was just what Rocky needed. His beard had become messy, his body stronger. But his heart…his heart had weakened. And Taarin healed it. Back in the shed he was training again, this time with jump ropes. He began to swing so fast you wouldn't see his feet even touch the ground. Then after a steady pace of that he finished up with a speedy series of jumps that made dust fly straight out of the holes in the barn and straight into the neighboring houses. Silence in the darkness creeps into your soul Envy moves the light of self control The gate that holds you captive has the door Burnin' with determination to even up the score Sit ups had apparently gotten boring, so Rocky did something called \"air ups\". John would hold Rocky's feet down from the balcony in the barn, and Rocky would do sit ups, and punch the air at the top of them. Drago pushed himself up and down inside a machine that simulated the same workout, but Rocky's extent was just plain crazy. The results were showing as Rocky chopped wood with John. Each wood block was cut with incredible precision and power. Before it was normal wood chopping, but now it seemed as if some powerful force was destroying a castle wall. Drago then began to ease up on training while Rocky tied up a bunch of large Rocky's in a net and then lifted them using pulleys by turning his back and pulling. The pain was almost nigh impossible to endure, and his back ached, yet his iron will would not be broken. His heart was raging deep within his soul, and it was on fire… Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high The moment of truth draws near More new training for Rocky was done. He would lie on a table and then lift up his entire body like sit-ups, but always keep his arms on the sides of the table in that same bent position. \"Come on, Rocky. No pain.\" Said Tony. 3580psi That's what the monitor said after Drago hit the punching machine. 4700psi 6000psi Bam! Another punch from Drago and the machine broke down, shocking the audience watching. Time will not allow you to stay still, no Silence breaks the heart and bends the will Defense is guilty passions out of control Rules and regulations have no meaning any more Drago received his daily shot of yellow liquid. In the tube, a combination of Ki science and anabolic steroids. His strength was almost doubled each time he took one of those shots, and it was soon thought that if he were to get any stronger, the world would be unable to handle such a behemoth. Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high The moment of truth is here Rocky was in his room, looking at all the photographs. Then the photograph of Drago caught his eye, and he grabbed and crushed it in one motion. He then tossed the paper into the garbage and went outside to go back to training. Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Fever's risin', energizin', right up to till end All of his friends were in the large wooden wheel-barrel type device. Rocky then grabbed the ends that a hose would normally grab and began lifting up the heavy thing very slowly. At this point Rocky was extremely buffed up, more muscular than he had ever been before in his life. Drago was lifting the heaviest weight he had ever lifted in his life. He pushed with all his might as the crowd watched with anticipation. Both of them raised their weights into the air. But Drago dropped his almost instantly. \"DRAGO!!\" Rocky yelled as he kept his comrades in air/ Heart's on fire Strong desire Rages deep within Fever's risin' Energizin' Right up till the end Heart's on fire Strong desire… Raging in till the end… Rocky was back to running and Drago was on a treadmill. Rocky began to run extremely fast up and loose his Russian guards while the trainers in Drago's camp pushed a button that slowly made the treadmill stepper, life a cliff. Both struggled to keep moving, to go the distance. But Drago feel. Rocky kept on running up the mountain, up to it's pinnacle. He climbed and grabbed until he reached the peak and screamed out his opponent's name. \"DRAGOOOO!!! DRAGOOOO!! DRAGOOOO!!\" yelled Rocky with his arms extended. It was the night before the fight. The sun was beginning to set over this part of Russia, and Rocky's group had to catch their flight to Moscow. They were all packed and ready to go. Rocky had even shaved and got his regular appearance back. But before they could leave, their host stopped them. \"Mr. Pinnicle, wait! I have something for you!\" he said with a thick Russian accent. Rocky looked puzzled as he was handed a small orange orb. \"It is my most prized possession, and I give it to you: for good luck.\" \"Gee, thanks. But really, you didn't have to give me this…\" began Rocky. \"No, I had to atone. I had spied on you and reported you to the government, and you are in fact and kind and great man. Please, forgive me.\" \"Hey, no harm no fo-\" BLAM!! The cabin blew up. The large group turned in front of them quickly after the explosion (and falling face first into the snow), and saw Kermit standing in front of them. Only Kermit was different. He had huge muscles and was gigantic, like a wrestler, but bigger. Still, he had the guns in his arms. And next to him was Dingus, wearing a Soviet soldier outfit. \"Kermit!!\" yelled Rocky in anger. \"Hi-ho, hi-ho!\" yelled the frog. \"It's time for you to die, Rocky Pinnicle!\" yelled Dingus angrily. \"I've got a flight to catch,\" he replied calmly. \"Sorry, but your flight has been CANCELLED!!\" yelled Kermit as he and Dingus charged towards Rocky. Closing his eyes calmly, Rocky jumped up in the air in the right time and moved his body the right way (it was very quick and none of us saw), and when he landed, he stood in the wind like a stationary stone. Soon after, Kermit and Dingus, who had stopped moving completely, fell to the ground. \"Bravo, Comrade Pinnicle,\" said Picard as he clapped his hands, walking towards Rocky. \"And just who are you?\" said Rocky, who was facing the other way. \"He's Comrade Picard of the Soviet Army. He's pretty tough Rocky!\" yelled Turtle-Man. \"So are you here to escort me to the airport?\" asked Rocky. \"Far from it.\" Said Picard as he suddenly appeared right in front of Rocky and threw a punch at his face. Rocky did not move, because the punch did not hit his face. Picard simply held his fist in front of Rocky's face. \"Impressive,\" Picard laughed. The general threw off his vest to reveal the powerful figure underneath it and got into fighting stance. \"Now, Mr. Pinnicle, prepare to me-\" Bam! Boom! Pow! Boom! Rocky unleashed a quick series of powerful blows on Picard, who stumbled backward in pain, clutching his gut. Blood coughed out of his mouth in surprise. It blew his mind that anyone was this much more powerful than him. \"He….heh….Very impressive. But let me ask you this Rocky: Can you beat yourself?\" asked Picard. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Heh…Come out: Rocky Statue!!\" Out of the snow a figure jump into the air and landed solidly in front of Rocky. It was that statue in Boston, but somehow it had come to life and was staring down at Rocky. \"Now…Attack!!!\" yelled Picard. The statue obeyed and threw an incredibly fast punch at Rocky, which he ducked under and countered with an uppercut. The statue felt no pain and simply turned it's head back down to face Rocky and quickly gave him a punch to head. Rocky zoomed backwards at the attack but stopped himself in mid-air and then charged back forward towards the statue. When he got there, however, he couldn't see the statue anywhere. \"He's in the snow!!\" yelled Bob. Rocky moved his eyes around shiftily as sweat fell from his brow. He would have to rely on all of his sense other than Ki to detect this monster. Suddenly, a tiny sound was heard in the snow. Rocky quickly turned and kicked the statue that was standing behind him, but to no avail. The beast still unleashed and overhead smash to Rocky's head. After pulling himself from the ground, he got an idea. \"Fire Starter!\" yelled Rocky as he threw two small energy boomerangs from his hands. They hit the powerful state, but did not explode. Part of them were inside the statue while the other part was still hanging outside in the air. \"Good, it works.\" Rokcy said to himself. \"What are you doing stupid?! Throw bigger ones!!\" yelled Bob. While dodging the statue's attacks Rocky threw more and more Fire Starters at it until eventually the statue's entire body was covered in them. He smirked as he saw the glowing monster head towards him and then he raised a ki filled hand up the air. Then all of the Fire Starters got bigger…and bigger. Soon you couldn't even see the staue, though he was still attacking. \"I think that oughta do it.\" Said Rocky as he clenched his fist. BOOM!! The giant explosion made the night sky as bright as daylight. All of the people there closed their eyes but Turtle-Man, who had brought along sunglasses. After the light and dust cleared, a clear winner was shown. Rocky stood over the remains of the statue and looked at Picard intently. Picard then ran away like a little girl. \"Well, let's get going. We'll be late for our flight,\" Rocky said to his friends. \"And your fight.\" Said P.J. \"Hello everyone, merry Christmas. We're in Moscow in the Soviet Union in which we will see probably the most watched sporting event in all of history. The Mountain Peak, Rocky Pinnicle, facing off against Ivan Drago, whose nickname has changed since that tragedy in Las Vegas to 'Death from Above'. \" said the American commentator. Backstage, Rocky was getting the tape wrapped around his hands. The other were looking at the two Soviet guards watching them through a glass window, but Rocky's mind was elsewhere. He punched his gloves together and they made sounds more powerful than the crowd that was chanting his opponent's name… While Maci walked around back and forth (cloaked in an American flag), Rocky began to pray in his little corner of the room. This day, this most sacred of days, would be the day he fought the most evil of evils. Two thousand and four years ago a little baby was born, and that little baby changed human history forever. Rocky wasn't here to change history. He was just there to prevail. He was just there to topple the evils of the world and show that good guys can still win. He was there to help finish Apollo's dream of beating ithem/i once and for all. \"Rocky, I know you and I have had some bad times in the past…\" began Turtle-Man as he, Rocky, Bob, Maci and Tony walked out of the locker room. \"But you've always been there for me when I needed help, even when I was acting all stupid and crazy. And, I don't usually express feelings too well, but…If I could jump out of my skin and be anybody I wanted to, it'd be you…\" he said with tears in his eyes. \"Thanks, TM.\" Said Rocky as he hugged Turtle-Man. \"Now knock this guy's teeth out!\" yelled Turtle-Man as he headed for the seating area, followed by two guards, Rocky and company moved towards the steel-gate door and it was opened for them by a Soviet guard standing by. As they entered the arena, Rocky's white robe gleamed in the light. His friends looked up to see all of the booing Russians who were proudly waving their U.S.S.R. flags. \"Man, listen to this crowd! We knew he wouldn't be popular, but this is based on pure hatred!\" yelled one commentator as Rocky walked towards the ring. Nicoli Kotoff smiled as he watched Pinnicle get booed by so many people: a crowd reaction he was not used to. \"But man, this guys is rock solid! The booing crowd does not seem to bother him one bit.\" Said the commentator as Rocky looked up at where all the government officials were sitting. He then turned his head back towards the ring. \"He's a picture of concentration. The champ has a look tonight that could burn through lead. Rocky entered the ring and looked out to see the entrance of the Russian National Champion. The lights dimmed and Drago jogged towards the ring, following the two men carrying torches. The smoke had spread and the man entered the ring and went to his corner, which had an entire empire backing it. All the time he was out there Drago and Rocky stared at one another until Drago looked toward Kotoff and nodded, who then did the same. \"I would like to point out that this is a non-sanctioned match. It is not for the title. The American Boxing Commission has not sanctioned this fight. This is not for the title,\" Said one British commentator. Both men removed their robes. Both of them wearing trunks that represented their nation, but one of the trunks had a story. One of them belonged to one of the greatest fighters of all time, who could never fight again. One of them had sweat and blood in them. One of them did not. As Drago removed his robe he got a standing ovation. Then, after both robes were removed, music started playing. The entire crowd turned to salute the Soviet flag as the Soviet nation anthem played. A gigantic flag-like backdrop was raised from the back and on the flag was none other than Ivan Drago and the hammer and sickle. That symbol used to represent a government that was for the people. Now it was as tainted as a swastika. After the music stopped the lighting in the room became brighter once again. Rocky and Drago remained the same. They had been staring at each other ever since Drago entered the ring. The bad blood could be cut with a knife. \"Ladies and Gentman! \"yelled the announcer, who was in the center of ring. He began speaking in Russian, introducing Rocky. The crowd jeered. \"Never in my life have I seen such a hostile crowd,\" Said the British man. Then he introduced Drago. The crowd cheered. Rocky and Drago met one another in the center of the ring. They looked deep into each other's eyes, totally ignoring everything the Russian ref was saying. They just looked at each other for the longest time, with Drago towering over Rocky. Drago was the only one of them to speak up there. \"I must break you.\" Smash! Drago hit Rocky's gloves down forcefully. After his little show of his new power, Drago headed to his corner, as did Rocky. \"Hey Rocky, remember what I said about wanting to be you?\" asked Turtle-Man. \"Yeah?\" \"Forget it.\" Rocky turned to face Drago, who was in his corner and replied \"Thanks, TM.\" Rocky then knelt back down in his corner to pray again while Drago danced a bit in his corner. After praying Rocky got some advice from Tony. \"Take it to him, Rock! Be a rock fighter! Be a rock fighter! No pain!\" yelled Tony. \"No pain.\" Replied Rocky. \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"Alright, go do it!!\" yelled Tony. Ding! Ding! Rocky and Drago met each other in the center of the ring, but Drago had much longer arms and got the first punch. Bam! A right to the head. Drago slowly moved Rocky into his own corner with one-two combos to the chest and head, occasionally taking the time to do an extra punch in one of the two areas. Rocky was taking some serious punishment from Drago until he grabbed the ropes and swung around them just like Rey Mysterio and landed right behind Drago. In the center of the ring Drago once again was giving Rocky long blows to the head. Rocky tried to get in to punch Drago, but he couldn't get past his long reaching arms. Then, quickly and masterfully, Rocky charged Drago and shoved him up against the ropes. Bam! Bam! Bam! Rocky pounded away at Drago's mid-section. Zoom! Drago pushed Rocky into the center of the ring and smiled widely, showing Rocky his black mouth-guard. Rocky ran back against the ropes and continued pounding at Drago's mid-section but then the swooped around and it was Drago who was pounding away at Rocky's head. They began to move around the ring as they fought, giving Rocky more opportunity. He tried for a leaping punch with his right, but he missed and got another hard blow from Drago. Drago grabbed Rocky and held him up by the neck and began to pound away at his head. The crowd cheered as he tossed Rocky to the ground hard, causing a cut to appear in the corner of Rocky's head. The ref began to count. Rocky had already fallen to the ground in Round 1. Rocky managed to shake it off and get up quickly. Drago was waiting near him and then went back to smashing Rocky's body with his Soviet super punches. He was beating up Rocky in Rocky's corner, with his friends getting a close up view of their friend's battle. Ding! Ding! The round had ended, but Rocky held onto Drago and charge him forward. Drago stopped them in the middle of the ring and shoved Rocky back into his own corner like a rag-doll. It had not been a great start. \"Things aren't looking so good for Rocky Pinnicle. Not only is fighting a seemingly invincibly opponent, he is also fighting a very hostile crowd and the Soviet government officials looking on,\" said one America commentator. \"This is all the Democratic party's fault!\" yelled the other American commentator, who happened to be Rush Limbaugh. \"If they hadn't supported of great president more then the Soviet Union wouldn't have risen again! Them and there talk of 'equal rights' and 'helping the homeless' and 'caring about other people'…Now we have to watch our good home boys get beat up by those damn ruskies!\" \"Should you really be saying that in the Soviet Union?\" asked his colleague. \"Ha! What are those stupid ruskies going to do-\" Zap! A Soviet soldier zapped Rush with a tazer and dragged him out of the arena, into prison. \"Alright, what's happening out there?\" asked Tony as he took a cotton ball and bobbed it against Rocky's bloody head. \"He's winning…I see three of him out there…\" replied Rocky. \"Hit the one in the middle,\" Suggested Bob. \"Right! Hit the one in the middle,\" repeated Tony. \" You're not doing as you are told! The American is small and weak…weak. \" said Drago's trainer as Drago took a drink of water. \"No pain!!\" yelled Tony. \"No pain!\" yelled Rocky. \"Take his heart!!\" \"Take his heart!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" Ding Ding! Round 2 began. Rocky and Drago moved toward the center of the ring, and once again Drago's long punches hit Rocky. But this time, Rocky ducked under some of them. He was also circling Drago and managed to stay in the center of the ring. \"Rocky Pinnicle has taken Drago's best punches so far! He's cut and he's bleeding but he's on his feet!\" Rocky made a leaping punch but missed, and then felt Drago give him a powerful blow to the head. Bam! Another leaping punch, but this one made contact. Drago grabbed Rocky and threw him to the ground hard. Rocky quickly got up and got Drago in the gut once before Drago unleashed a one-two combo on his head and he fell again. He quickly got up again, only to take more one-twos from Drago. \"He's getting killed out there!\" yelled Maci. Bam! Bam! Bam! More pain was found in Rocky's body every second he was out there. Drago's blows were incredibly painful. Rocky was now up against his corner, taking blows from Drago. The two swung around, but only for Drago to punch Rocky in the gut and sending him to the opposite corner. But Rocky was ready. He landed on the side of the corner and then pushed himself forward, charging for Drago at a high speed. Filling his punch with ki, he unleashed a furious blow to Drago's head, giving him a deep cut. \"The Russians cut! And it's a bad cut!!\" yelled one commentator. Now it was Rocky coming after Drago. Rocky was punishing Drago for his sins as Drago retreated backwards. Drago was now feeling true pain. Bam! A powerful punch by Rocky sent Drago into a nearby corner, greatly injuring his back. Rocky pounded away at the stalled Drago, but Drago threw enough punches to get out of the corner and back into the center of the ring. Back in the center of the ring, Rocky once again charged like a bull and shoved Drago against the ropes, and then began beating on the larger man. He would not stop unleashing powerful blows to Drago's head. Even when the bell rang and the ref pulled at him he would not stop. Drago grabbed Rocky by the throat and punched him in the head. Rocky, in turn, picked up Drago and threw him to the ground with Rocky on top of him. Rocky punched at the laying Drago and had to be pulled off by the ref and his team-mates. \"It's a gutter war! No holds barred in Moscow!! Rocky may be on the receiving end so far, but he's here to fight! This is shaping up to be a personal war and right now it's anybody's boxing match!!\" \"You're doing good Rocko. I couldn't have done better myself.\" Said Bob. \"Thanks, Bobbie.\" Replied Rocky as he sat down on his stool. \" How can you do this? He's nothing! Soft! \" yelled Drago's trainer. \"You got him hurt bad. No he's worried. You cut him! You hurt him! See?! He's not a machine! He's a man!\" yelled Tony. \" He is not human…he's like a piece of iron. \" Drago said as he got up. \"You want it more than he does! No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"No pain!!\" \"Okay, take it to him!!\" Ding! Round 3 began with Drago taking charge, but Rocky was blocking the blows well. He was circling his arms like a man rowing a kayak, blocking all blows Drago was giving him. Bam Bam! Rocky took two punches to his head. Bam Bam! Drago took two punches to his head. Rocky went for a ki filled punch but Drago blocked it with a small energy blast that dazzled the audience. Rocky didn't stop though. He gave Drago a powerful key filled uppercut to the jaw, and the bell rang as Drago stumbled backwards slightly. In his corner Drago smacked away his helper who was only trying to give him some water. Round 4 was Drago's round. He was pounding on Rocky that entire round, never letting up at one moment. Rocky got a few hits in, but Drago was the dominating force. The punches were all glowing with power, and some of the glowing power was left on Rocky's cheeks as he stumbled into his corner. Ivan raised his arm in victory for that round as the happy Russian politicians looked on. Round 5: Drago tried to punch Rocky, but Rocky managed to duck under and tie up Drago in bear-hold. They spun around in circles before the ref finally broke them up. Drago then continued his dominance he had in the third round and pummeled Rocky. Rocky didn't weaken though, he just kept on fighting. He tied up Drago in another spinning circle again, but this time when the ref separated them Drago's punch was so hard that it sent Rocky to the ground. He got up quickly as Drago stood in disbelief. Ding Ding!! The round had ended and both fighters went back into their corners. Tony patted Rocky on the back as he got on the stool. Ding Ding! Round 6: Drago got out from his corner in fury, wanting to crush this small American once and for all. It didn't work out so well. In his rage his attacks were more flailed around more and Rocky easily dodged them. Then Rocky began to beat up the Russian with all of his might, backing the Russian into a corner and beating him with every his arms had in them. Ding Ding! Drago went back to his corner, defeated in that round, and was determined to do better next time around. Round 7 was his chance. He got Rocky into a corner and began unleashing an army of blows upon him, but Rocky fought back and eventually brought the fight back into the center of the ring. Bam! A leaping blow damages Drago! Bam! A punch from Drago sends Rocky into a corner! Rocky quickly recovered from that and went back to trading punches with Drago. Rocky then gained the advantage late in the round and gave Drago more punches than a machine gun could have given him bullets in the same amount of time. Drago coughed up blood as his government watched, looking a little bit less than pleased. Round 8 was an interesting round for the fight. In this round Drago and Rocky decided to use some ki techniques. Drago began with a large energy blast similar to the Kamehameha wave, and Rocky countered with the Kamehameha wave. It was unclear if this was allowed or not in boxing, but the officials did nothing to stop it, they just stood out of the way. After the blast both faded (they exploded in the middle) Rocky and Drago did both did an interesting and strange technique. Both of them made duplicates of themselves out of ki energy, and the two warriors fought each other in the center of the ring. The glowing red-white and blue Rocky fought the yellow and red Ivan Drago. Suddenly another Rocky and Drago energy creation was made by both sides. Soon there were ten on each side, battling for supremacy. Then, all of the Drago fists met with all of the Rocky fists in a huge explosion as the bell rang. Both fighters got in their corners to prepare for the next round. Round 9: Drago, by this time, was fuming with rage. Drago quickly got Rocky into a corner but got pushed back by Rocky, who then yelled for him to come and attack. Drago moved forward only to get punched in the head by Rocky. Rocky brought the fight back into the center of the ring by attacking Drago to make him move there. Then Drago started attacking Rocky by punching him in the head, but Rocky kept moving forward, trying to get Drago into a corner. He did, and once he got there he gave much slower punches, but they were the most powerful ones he had thrown all night. Then, with one powerful fist, he pounded Drago in the head and that resulted in Drago's sweat flying away as if there had been an explosion on his skin. Round 10 was fought entirely in one corner. Rocky had been backed into a corner by Drago, who had the advantage at that time. But soon Rocky fought back while still in the corner, and he ended up pummeling Drago for a while. Then it was Drago who pummeled Rocky, and so on and so on. Rocky tried to move forward at one point, but Drago threw him into the corner. Rocky fell to the ground hard but quickly got up. His sheer determination was starting to win over some of the crowd, and there were a few scattered cheers for Rocky Pinnicle. When Rock fell to the ground in that round, Drago looked at him with a look of anger and hatred. When he began to get up, Drago looked at him with a sympathetic and somewhat of an understanding look. Ding Ding! The Round ended before any more punches could be thrown! Round 11 was another interesting round. When dodging one of Drago's punches, Rocky flew into the air. Drago got up in the air too, and soon both were near the ceiling and fighting their duel up there. At one point in their aerial battle Rocky grabbed Drago and threw him towards the ground. Drago stopped himself halfway down and charged back upwards only to be met by a Kamehameha wave. The wave was pushing Drago down, but he punched it back at Rocky, who was then hit by the blast and fell all the way down to the floor of the ring. Rocky was hurt, but he got up just as quickly and the two continued their fight on the ground. Ding Ding! The round ended and both fighters went back into their corners. Drago was standing tall as a blast of water came out from his water bottle and went into his mouth. He swished it around angrily as he looked at Rocky, sitting on his stool, in intense pain. He spit out the water into the bucket and made an angry scowl at Rocky. \"Come on!\" Rocky yelled, extending his arm. \"Daa!!\" replied Drago, in anger. Round 12: Rocky began strong, punching away at Drago's mid-section. Drago then punched Rocky in a furious manner, and his opponent fell to the ground. Rocky quickly got up from this and got a lot of cheers from the audience, which now seemed to be cheering for him more than their own Drago. By this point both fighters were groggy and their blows were getting slow. As they moved across the ring they exchanged weaker and slower blows. At one point they just stopped in the center and took turns hitting the other fighter's head, each blow causing sweat and blood to fly off of their bodies. Then the bell rang to end the round. \"No pain!!\" yelled Tony. Rocky just nodded at that. \" He is weak!! Weak!! \" yelled Drago's trainer. He just nodded. Then, before the bell had rung, Rocky got up from his stool, as did Drago. They stood up tall, ready to fight. Round 13 was an unlucky round (at first) for Rocky. Drago began to dominate once again and greatly injure Rocky. It seemed as if Rocky might lose the fight in this round. Drago was seemingly unbeatable. But then the crowd cheered for Rocky. They cheered with incredibly might, and Rocky got up. He then went back to fighting Drago. He was fighting for them, for him, for America and for Apollo. Bam! Bam! Rocky was now the one taking charge. Then it was Drago, then Rocky, then Drago. Then they began to block each other's blows with other elbows and fists. The round ended slowly as the two struggled to lift their arms to throw more punches. They were incredibly sluggish at this point. There was no strategy: just strength. The strongest one would be the survivor. Round 14 was pure hell for both fighters. Every punch used up large amounts of ki, every blow damaged them more than the last. They were using everything they had in this round. Every little bit of energy they had stored in them was being used, and more blood was shed in this round because of it. By the end of the round, there was no ki left in either of them. It was just another back and forth exchange of blows between them, incredibly slow and painful blows. It was just as painful to throw the punch as to receive, yet both kept on fighting with all their might. Even when the bell rang they kept the exchange of punches going and were eventually pulled apart by their teams. As they were being pulled apart, Kotoff left his seat and headed towards the ring. Those 14 rounds had been 42 minutes of pain and struggle for each fighter, and the resting minutes in between were even more painful because they did not have the fight to distract from the pain. Rocky had won over the Soviet crowd, who were now all chanting for him. \"It's amazing! The champ's determination has actually won what was once an extremely hostile crowd! This is incredible!!\" Kotoff came up to Rimski and held him by the collar. \" You trained this fool! He is a disgrace!! \" yelled Kotoff as he threw back Drago's lead trainer. Kotoff then turned towards Drago and spoke to him: \" Listen to them…Our people cheer for iHIM!/i…You idiot! \" Kotoff pushed Drago's head as he said, \" Win! \" Drago looked at Kotoff with angry eyes. This man had ruled over his life, had forced him to kill, had forced him to become the bad guy. Drago stood up and raised Kotoff by the neck into the air. Drago's wife yelled for him to drop him, which he did. Drago then began to speak to the crowd. \" I fight to win!! For me!! For me!! \" Drago yelled to the crowd. \"What round is it?\" Rocky asked faintly. \"15. One more round. There's no stopping this now. This is our round,\" replied Tony. \"We're not stopping now. Don't stop! All your spirit! All your love! Everything you've got! To win you gotta punch and punch till you can't punch no more! This is your whole life here!! Do it now!! Now!!\" Ding ding! Rocky and Drago met in the center of the ring. Drago raised his gloves to his stomach, as did Rocky. Drago gently pushed Rocky's gloves and spoke to him softly saying, \"To the end…\" Rocky looked at him, slightly surprised by this show of emotion. The two circled each other as Rocky came to the realization that Drago had no choice but to kill Apollo. If he didn't kill him: he'd be killed. He was nothing but a pawn, a slave to a brutal system that he used to have faith in. And now Rocky was fighting a man who had realized his sinful mistakes on the very same day that his savior…the man who came to save them all from sin was born. Rocky felt a bit of guilt on his part for partaking in brutal warfare on this holy day of days. Drago punched Rocky in the head. Then another punch from Drago. \"Come on!\" Drago said in a muffled voice, inviting Rocky with his arm to attack. Did he want to lose? Did he want Rocky to knock him out and make this evil empire fall? Bam! Bam! Bam! Three powerful punches from Drago. Maybe not. Or maybe Drago wanted Rocky to win, but having to use everything in him to do so. \"Come on!! What are you waiting for?\" yelled Tony. \"Come on!!\" yelled Drago, inviting Rocky forward with hi arm. Drago punched Rocky, and then got the same invitation from Rocky he had been getting. Drago accepted it and threw a punch at Rocky. He dodged it by moving his head to the side. Then another punch was dodged the same way. After Rocky dodged four punches Rocky yelled \"Come on!! Fight!!\" Bam! Drago punched Rocky and invited him to come and attack. Rocky didn't, and thus did Drago begin to be the one throwing all the punches. Then Rocky made a leaping punch at Drago's head, and it created a loud thud on impact. Another powerful leaping punch! And another! Drago was in the lower right hand corner of the ring, and Rocky began punching him strongly. They moved to the end of the ropes for a bit, but then Rocky punched Drago back into the corner. Drago then unleashed a powerful blow to Rocky's head, sending him stuttering back a few feet. Then in the center of the ring they once again began that famous exchange of punches. Bam! Drago made a powerful punch! Bam! Rocky made a powerful punch! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Then Drago suddenly got three punches in. But Rocky made up for it by giving Drago punches the body as opposed to the head. He slowly but surely began pounding Drago's gut with his right arm. Then he began punching Drago's head, first with his left and then his right. Then Drago began punching at Rocky and they re-entered the center of the ring. Bam! Bam! Rocky was the only one of them getting blows in. He was pounding away with the last of his strength. \"You're gonna do it!!\" yelled Taarin from the crowd. Bam! Drago spun around slightly before falling to the ground hard. Rocky had made the giant Russian fall for the first time in the long match. Rocky ran towards him but the ref pushed him back. He ran towards him again yelling \"Come on! Come on!!\" but the ref pushed him back again and began the count. \" 1…2… \" \" Get up, Ivan!! \" yelled Ludmilla. \" 3…4…5…6… \" Drago struggled to get up, clinging onto the ropes for support. He slowly managed to raise himself off the ground. \" 7…8…9…10!! \" Drago fell through the ropes at that sound and Rocky raised both his arms in victory as he shut his eyes tight. The entire ring began to fill with people. \"10!! Rocky Pinnicle has done it!! This is absolute pandemonium and the crowd loves it!!\" The crowd was proudly chanting Rocky's name as the crowd in the ring lifted him up. Maci draped him with his American flag and Rocky waved to the people. Drago had only the ref to help get him up after the painful match. As Drago got back into a standing position, Rocky was lowered to the ground. A microphone was put in front of his face. \"Thank…thank you,\" Rocky said, out of breath. Bearfrog, holding the mic quickly put the mic up to his mouth and translated the words for the people. \"I came here tonight, and I didn't know what to expect…\" said Rocky. BearFrog than translated it into Russian for the crowd. \"I've seen a lot of people hating me…I didn't know how…to feel about that…so I guess…I didn't really like you much either…\" BearFrog said a much shorter phrase since he didn't know how to translate everything Rocky said. He just hoped the people got the jist of it. \"During this…fight…I've seen a lot of changing…the way you felt about me…and the way I felt about you…\" Rocky said, BearFrog cutting in between each break to translate. \"In here…there were two men…killing each other…but…I guess…that's better…than twenty million…\" Kotoff had returned to the others after being tossed down by Drago and was sitting with an angry scowl on his face while his fellow members of the Soviet government were listening intently to Rocky. \"All I'm trying to say is…If I can change…And you can change…Anybody can change!!\" The crowd cheered wildly at this. There was an explosion of applause from the crowd. Every government official seated in the balcony gave Rocky a slow standing ovation. Except for Kotoff. He was still sitting when the other members looked at him angrily, and he then got up and applauded. \"I just want to say one thing, to my girlfriend out in the crowd…Taarin! I love you!!\" yelled Rocky. BearFrog translated. \"And Merry Christmas to all of you!!\" \" And Merry Christmas to all of you!! \" Taarin met Rocky in the center of the ring and they gave each other a loving hug. \"Oh Rocky, I love you!!\" she said before she kissed him. \"Will you marry me?\" he asked. \"What?\" \"Will you marry me?\" \"Yes!! Oh, yes!!\" she yelled as she hugged her future husband. BearFrog was kind enough to translate for both of them, even using Taarin's dramatic feminine tones when speaking. It made him giggle on the side. Silence in the darkness creeps into your soul Envy moves the light of self control The gate that holds you captive has the door Burnin' with determination to even up the score Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high The moment of truth draws near Time will not allow you to stay still, no Silence breaks the heart and bends the will Defense is guilty passions out of control Rules and regulations have no meaning any more Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Heart's on fire, fever's risin', high The moment of truth is here Heart's on fire, strong desire, rages deep within Fever's risin', energizin', right up to till end Heart's on fire Strong desire Rages deep within Fever's risin' Energizin' Right up till the end Ooooh Heart's on fire Strong desire Raging till the end… Epilogue: Kotoff's comrades in government overthrew him and his evil regime.

He had seen enough. He had just watched his protégé, Adonis Creed, get the Hell beat out of him by Viktor Drago, son of the man who killed Donny's father and Rocky's adversary and friend, Apollo Creed. Rocky grabbed a rocks glass and a bottle of Jameson Whiskey from the behind the bar. He poured the whiskey into his glass. He was overridden with grief. More so now than when he when Apollo died in his arms in the ring the night he fought Ivan Drago. \"I tried to warn him. The kid's as stubborn as his old man.\" Rocky hadn't had a drop of alcohol since the night Adrian died sixteen years ago. He never felt the need for it until tonight. Guilt is a real son of a bitch. Rocky shot the whiskey from the glass into his mouth down his throat. \"Neither one of them would listen.\" Rocky refilled his glass. He looked up and saw the picture of Apollo on the wall. \"I'm sorry Apollo.\" Rocky shot the refill in the same fashion as the forst down his throat. A voice quickly shook him from his moment of self-pity. \"Maybe you should be Stallion!\" From the shadows appeared a long-gone figure dressed to the nines in an expensive suit and tie and shoes made out of genuine alligator hide. The dark figure walked with a swagger that echoed class, ego, style, and an aura of self confidence that Rocky would not confuse with anyone else in the world living or dead. The figure's smile lit up the room. Rocky knew he the figure was but couldn't believe it was him. \"Apollo?! Is it really you?\" \"Who else were you expecting? Paulie? He sends his best by the way.\" \"Damn. I'm never drinking again.\" \"This ain't the Jameson talking Stallion. It's really me. I'm here, and I gotta tell you, I'm not happy!\" \"I'm sorry Apollo. I tried to warn him I tried-\" \"Don't give me that shit Stallion! I didn't come here for no apology.\" \"He's just as stubborn as you are or were or whatever.\" \"You abandoned him Rocky! Why Damn it! Why?!\" \"I didn't want him to get hurt. I didn't want him to to\" \"To what? End up like me?!\" \"You don't know what its been like to carry the guilt like I have the last thirty-three years. I can't carry no more. Not for you or him!\" \"Oh God! Here we go! You've got guilt because of what happened. Let's clear the air right now: As far as you and I are concerned, you don't have a damned thing to be guilty about! I knew exactly what I was doing taking that fight with the Russian. I didn't take the fight because of me or him, I took it because of you Rock.\" \"Because of me.\" \"Man, nobody wanted to see me and Drago fight. They wanted to see you and him fight! I knew that! You remember when you asked me if the fight was about something else besides the fight. I wouldn't answer you, but you were right. I thought that if I could whip that boy in an exhibition, they'd look at me as a legitimate challenger to you. Then I'd fight you, get my belt back, and go out on top, like I was supposed to! But I was wrong.\" \"Obviously.\" \"You've been carrying around this guilt for over thirty years Stallion. Why? Because you didn't throw in the towel? If you would have thrown that towel in the ring, you wouldn't have had to worry about Drago coming after you, because the second I would have been healthy enough, I would have whipped your ass to Hell wouldn't have had it! I'm not mad because you didn't throw in that towel. If that was supposed to be it for me, I couldn't think of a better way to go then in that ring that night. You have no right or want to feel guilty about that. What I'm upset about and what you should feel guilty about is abandoning Adonis like you did. I never wanted any of my kids to follow me into the ring, but I knew Adonis would. And I knew that if he did, he'd find you and you would teach him the Eye of the Tiger and how to be the best and you wouldn't let anything happen to him. And man, you two were doing great. Won the Heavyweight Championship of the World. I'm looking down watching all of it with a smile on my face proud as a father can be and maybe even a little jealous too. Then you abandoned him, when he needed you the most. I want to know why Stallion? Rocky looked at Apollo uncomfortably. \"He was going to get hurt. I didn't want no part of that.\" \"You can bullshit a lot of people, but you can't bullshit me. You were scared. You know what, Adonis was scared too! And you let him down!\" Rocky bowed his head and began to cry. \"I'm sorry Apollo!\" Apollo placed his hand on Rocky's shoulder. \"I know Rock. I know. Now you got to make things right. You got to go to him. Let him know you're sorry. Let him know that you're gonna be there for him. He's not gonna let you back in so easy. His girl will. Maryanne will. But he won't. You're pretty high on his shit list right now. You hurt him. Maybe even more than the Russian did. You're going to have to give him sometime before he lets you back in \"Unc.\" He's going to fight Drago again. He has too! You got to make sure he's in the right place mind, body, and soul! You got to get his mind right! You gotta make sure he fights this fight, for all the right reasons. Not for me, you, his girl, Maryanne, but for himself! He needs to be a man! Show him the way! Take him to school Rock! That's what I want Rock! That's what I need Stallion!\" \"Absolutely. You got it Apollo. I'll do it.\" \"One more thing. I need one more favor.\" \"I don't think we can fight again Apollo. I'm old and you're a ghost I think.\" \"Yeah that would be \"highly irregular.\" No this isn't from me. It's from her. Apollo pointed to a picture of Adrian. \"She wants you to make things right.\" \"What things?\" \"She said you would know what she meant. Don't make her come down here.\" The two old friends shared a laugh. Rocky glanced down then back up. Apollo was gone. Rocky grabbed the phone and dialed a number. \"Yo, this is Rocky Balboa. I need to get on an airplane as soon as possible.\"","LastChapter":"Rocky and Apollo: The Conversation Rocky turned off the tv in the restaurant. He had seen enough.

The kid's as stubborn as his old man.\" Rocky hadn't had a drop of alcohol since the night Adrian died sixteen years ago. He never felt the need for it until tonight. Guilt is a real son of a bitch. Rocky shot the whiskey from the glass into his mouth down his throat. \"Neither one of them would listen.\" Rocky refilled his glass. He looked up and saw the picture of Apollo on the wall. \"I'm sorry Apollo.\" Rocky shot the refill in the same fashion as the forst down his throat. A voice quickly shook him from his moment of self-pity. \"Maybe you should be Stallion!\" From the shadows appeared a long-gone figure dressed to the nines in an expensive suit and tie and shoes made out of genuine alligator hide. The dark figure walked with a swagger that echoed class, ego, style, and an aura of self confidence that Rocky would not confuse with anyone else in the world living or dead. The figure's smile lit up the room. Rocky knew he the figure was but couldn't believe it was him. \"Apollo?! Is it really you?\" \"Who else were you expecting? Paulie? He sends his best by the way.\" \"Damn. I'm never drinking again.\" \"This ain't the Jameson talking Stallion. It's really me. I'm here, and I gotta tell you, I'm not happy!\" \"I'm sorry Apollo. I tried to warn him I tried-\" \"Don't give me that shit Stallion! I didn't come here for no apology.\" \"He's just as stubborn as you are or were or whatever.\" \"You abandoned him Rocky! Why Damn it! Why?!\" \"I didn't want him to get hurt. I didn't want him to to\" \"To what? End up like me?!\" \"You don't know what its been like to carry the guilt like I have the last thirty-three years. I can't carry no more. Not for you or him!\" \"Oh God! Here we go! You've got guilt because of what happened. Let's clear the air right now: As far as you and I are concerned, you don't have a damned thing to be guilty about! I knew exactly what I was doing taking that fight with the Russian. I didn't take the fight because of me or him, I took it because of you Rock.\" \"Because of me.\" \"Man, nobody wanted to see me and Drago fight. They wanted to see you and him fight! I knew that! You remember when you asked me if the fight was about something else besides the fight. I wouldn't answer you, but you were right. I thought that if I could whip that boy in an exhibition, they'd look at me as a legitimate challenger to you. Then I'd fight you, get my belt back, and go out on top, like I was supposed to! But I was wrong.\" \"Obviously.\" \"You've been carrying around this guilt for over thirty years Stallion. Why? Because you didn't throw in the towel? If you would have thrown that towel in the ring, you wouldn't have had to worry about Drago coming after you, because the second I would have been healthy enough, I would have whipped your ass to Hell wouldn't have had it! I'm not mad because you didn't throw in that towel. If that was supposed to be it for me, I couldn't think of a better way to go then in that ring that night. You have no right or want to feel guilty about that. What I'm upset about and what you should feel guilty about is abandoning Adonis like you did. I never wanted any of my kids to follow me into the ring, but I knew Adonis would. And I knew that if he did, he'd find you and you would teach him the Eye of the Tiger and how to be the best and you wouldn't let anything happen to him. And man, you two were doing great. Won the Heavyweight Championship of the World. I'm looking down watching all of it with a smile on my face proud as a father can be and maybe even a little jealous too. Then you abandoned him, when he needed you the most. I want to know why Stallion? Rocky looked at Apollo uncomfortably. \"He was going to get hurt. I didn't want no part of that.\" \"You can bullshit a lot of people, but you can't bullshit me. You were scared. You know what, Adonis was scared too! And you let him down!\" Rocky bowed his head and began to cry. \"I'm sorry Apollo!\" Apollo placed his hand on Rocky's shoulder. \"I know Rock. I know. Now you got to make things right. You got to go to him. Let him know you're sorry. Let him know that you're gonna be there for him. He's not gonna let you back in so easy. His girl will. Maryanne will. But he won't. You're pretty high on his shit list right now. You hurt him. Maybe even more than the Russian did. You're going to have to give him sometime before he lets you back in \"Unc.\" He's going to fight Drago again. He has too! You got to make sure he's in the right place mind, body, and soul! You got to get his mind right! You gotta make sure he fights this fight, for all the right reasons. Not for me, you, his girl, Maryanne, but for himself! He needs to be a man! Show him the way! Take him to school Rock! That's what I want Rock! That's what I need Stallion!\" \"Absolutely. You got it Apollo. I'll do it.\" \"One more thing. I need one more favor.\" \"I don't think we can fight again Apollo. I'm old and you're a ghost I think.\" \"Yeah that would be \"highly irregular.\" No this isn't from me. It's from her. Apollo pointed to a picture of Adrian. \"She wants you to make things right.\" \"What things?\" \"She said you would know what she meant. Don't make her come down here.\" The two old friends shared a laugh. Rocky glanced down then back up. Apollo was gone. Rocky grabbed the phone and dialed a number. \"Yo, this is Rocky Balboa. I need to get on an airplane as soon as possible.\"","Summary":" Rocky and Apollo: The Conversation Rocky turned off the tv in the restaurant. He had seen enough.

I know this because I'm not rich. A/N: This is my first fanfic! :D Flames are welcome, I honestly don't care. This is not an authentic view on The Pale Man's past…I was looking for the authentic story, but couldn't find it. Wrote my own past. So yeah. R&R.; \"You're deathly pale, you know,\" Nina said, chastising her new guest. His tall, thin frame bristled slightly as he chuckled, nodding in agreement. \"You should get out in the sun more often,\" she continued. \"It can't be that you're in good health. Hungry?\" Nina scooped some hot, steaming rice onto his plate. The man chuckled again, his two, blue eyes shining. Ravenous, he hastily grabbed his fork and began to tear into his rice. It tasted marvelous, and he hadn't eaten in days. He had always preferred meat, though, and asked shyly if she had any. Nina smiled sadly. \"There hasn't been meat for us to eat in many years. I hope you do not mind. You must come from a rich family to expect such gifts. Please, what is your name? Where have you come from?\" \"My name? I could not venture a guess. I don't remember where I have come from, or who I was when I left,\" he answered, staring straight ahead, embarrassed that he had put her in such a position. He did not mean to be so rude. \"That's alright,\" she said cheerily, and then laughed. \"Shall we just call you Pale Man, then? This is what the entire village is calling you now, you know. What else could we call you? Scar Hands? That would be rude, would it not? No other feature stands out, and the people did not know your name. I am not so skilled in reading and writing that I could give you one, either. Unless you have one to give yourself?\" \"Pale Man is fine,\" he laughed back, not at all offended by her remarks. Honestly, he was astounded and impressed with her unbridled sense of humor. It was a refreshing feeling. Still, he subconsciously looked down at the strange scar like crevices on the palms of his hands and touched them gingerly with his claw-like nails. When he looked back up, Nina was cleaning the dishes before she had touched a bit of food herself. \"Are you not eating?\" he asked, concerned. She seemed almost slimmer than himself. \"My siblings need plenty of food if they are to grow up healthy and strong. I eat only twice a day, if that. The children are worth it, and they are grateful. Sometimes they beg me to take their food. They are kind children.\" Her eyes were smoldering and proud. She opened her mouth as if to speak, but closed it again, thinking better of it. She continued washing, looking over to the window every so often to look at the children play in the grass. A group of fat, well dressed children stared at the thin romping figures, and then continued their less physical idea of play, occasionally looking distastefully at Nina's younger siblings. Their faces were round and plump, and their small eyes were hateful. The Pale man did not care for these small, corpulent imps that dared stare at the kind and caring creatures just outside the window. How did they get so fat, with food in such shortage as Nina had suggested? \"Could not those children give up some of their food? They look like pigs, ready for slaughter. Certainly they need no more.\" He pointed to them, and Nina's gaze fell beyond them, staring into space with a look of pure malice apparent in her eyes. The Pale Man felt a combination of anger at the greedy children and guilt that he had stolen some food that could have been given to the frail frames of Nina and her siblings that did not settle with his stomach. Nina's eyes grew smoldering as she looked to him. \"They are pigs, and they are ready for slaughter. Their looks are just. They tease poor little Maria, for she is the smallest and cannot protect herself. Her brothers help her when they see, but Maria likes going off by herself. They are sons and daughters of aristocrats, and they take everything. They take our food and our land, they take our health and our work. We receive nothing from them. Pigs, all of them,\" Nina sighed. Though said with a certain air of calm and control, Nina's copper skin grew hot and her dark eyes became fiery with an internal flame that leapt and burned through the Pale Man's skull. Her gaunt face was tight and expressionless as she dried her hands and moved into the next room to start cleaning. When the Pale Man offered his help, Nina rejected it and asked him to rest. Still, he helped her pick up after the children's things and a few other small chores before they both sat down on comfortable chairs. Nina had seemed to calm a bit, and her face was now relaxed, her eyes exhausted and soft. Waves of dark, shiny hair fell about her face and shoulders and caught the light coming in from the window, revealing brilliant reddish highlights that sparkled and glinted as she moved her head about. The Pale Man could not remember anything so beautiful. Nina smiled at him from her chair and asked him about his pale skin, encouraging him to guess his origins. She wondered if he were a Frank, but he shook his head. If he were a Frank, how should he know such Spanish? They talked of his past for a while, and then spoke of hers. Her parents had been farmers, but the aristocrats greed had stolen them from her. Her mother grew ill, and in a frantic effort to save her life, Nina's father had allowed her all of his own food, taking none for himself, no matter how hungry he became. When her father passed, her mother died shortly after. Whether it had been of shock or of illness, Nina could never tell, but once they had gone the little band of siblings had to farm the land themselves while the aristocrats sat in their beautiful homes and wasted the day, growing almost as pale as the Pale Man himself. By the time Nina finished her tale, the Pale Man's eyes too were angry. How could anyone be so heartless? Neither the young woman nor the young man had an answer. Somehow, without either noticing, the sun had moved slowly down towards the Earth, and Nina became frantic. She had allowed the children play far too long, and the crops needed tending to before dark settled over the village and the insufficient light of the moon made even the most rotten pieces of food look milky and succulent. Her once smiling face was terribly troubled and filled with dread. She had almost lost the entire days work, and her frustration and anger was apparent in her staccato movements and harsh cries to her brothers and sisters. \"Now look what you've done, I've lost nearly the whole day!\" She yelled back to her guest as she ran out the door, hurrying her stunned siblings to hard labor. Hours passed slowly; Nina would not allow the Pale Man to help her in the fields, for he was still recovering, though he begged her to allow him to make up for the time he had caused her to lose. Only the day before he had still been unconscious, and she asked him to be mindful of that. Her tone was hard and almost sarcastic, so he did not try to contradict her. So the Pale Man sat in solitude, falling into a dreamlike state where the taste of meat combined with his hatefulness of the greedy children that hurt poor little Maria. It was not until Nina returned with her siblings that the Pale Man realized that these visions were so closely intertwined, and he stared fearfully at his scars as his stomach growled, demanding flesh. A/N: There you have it folks. Random fanfiction from my own head. Wanted more on the Pale Man so I MADE more. End of story. Well not technically. I plan on updating this. NOW REVIEW!!!![Chapter 2] A/N: If I don't start getting reviews for this I'm going to get annoyed. Might delete it. The only review I have is from someone I know in real life. Please Review after reading?? Maria would have loved if the stranger would talk more, but he didn't even seem to be listening to her. She was trying to tell him all about her favorite cat, Anita, and the things she had done that day, but he didn't seem to care. Brow furrowed, she pat him on the knee and looked up at him, her expression accusatory. \"You're not listening!\" she protested firmly, her lips pouting. \"You have to listen, or I will spell you, and you won't be able to eat anything for a whole day!\" Her imagination was surpassed by none in the family. The pale man merely smiled, amused, and looked at her playfully, tickling her a bit. Her musical laughter reverberated throughout the whole house, and Nina smiled at him, grateful he was keeping her entertained. \"You will spell me? Oh, now I am truly frightened, Miss Maria, your powers are so strong!\" he cried, playing along with her little charade, making her laugh harder, squealing with delight. Her dark ringlets sprung back and forth, dancing just as gleefully as her eyes. She began to crawl around the room on all fours, laughing as she went. She sat on the floor next to him, purring and rubbing her head against his white leg. She began to scratch at his knee with her loosely held fist and look up at him with her dancing eyes wide. He pet her head a bit, and laughter once again flooded the home, coming out in shaky attempts at a meowing sound, like that of a cat. \"So, Miss Maria the cat, you were telling me about your loyal subject Miss Anita?\" he urged, patting her head once more. She immediately leapt to her feet and began spinning her marvelous tale once again, with just the same if not more enthusiasm than the first time she had told it. The pale man was sure to pay close attention this time, lest the child begin the cycle again. Nina had been softly chuckling in the background the whole time while she cooked lunch for her family and the strange man who now resided with them. She was no longer angry at him for the night before. In fact, she apologized many times for her rude behavior towards him, to which he had replied \"Please, I understand. Things are difficult, there is no reason to apologize. I just wish I could be more helpful.\" He was a dream come true for them. Maria was in the middle of recanting a particularly suspenseful part of her story in which the fearless Anita had bravely gone off to slay the terrible dragonfly when the twins came bursting in the house, both yelling out two versions of some argument, looking for their older sister to settle it. Sternly she looked at them, and both fell silent. \"Now,\" she began seriously, \"we can hear the story. One at a time, please. I do not want to burn your dinner. Bonita first, Fernando,\" she finished before they could both begin speaking again. \"Nina, Fernando is being mean!\" At this, Fernando began to protest, but a single look from Nina silenced him. Maria and the pale man stared in awe. \"He keeps telling me my hair is ugly, and that I will end up an old maid because no one will ever want to marry me! He won't stop!\" The girl was more annoyed than seriously hurt, being an older age than Maria, who at such a thought would have attempted to attack her brother angrily. Fernando glared at his twin, arms crossed tightly. He was clearly furious, and the pale man thought she may have done something to provoke those comments, that he did not deny saying. \"She keeps being annoying and trying to poke me! Tell her to stop poking and I'll stop making fun!\" he cried indignantly. Nina was obviously uninterested in the trials of these children. She went back to her cooking, not even bothering to respond, except with a look that both scared them into silence. They knew better than to interrupt her for such trivial problems that could easily be solved, if only they would give up on being stubborn. The two looked at each other concernedly, wondering when they were going to get their sister back. Ever since their parents died, Nina had not had any time to help them or have fun with them. They walked away then like mutts with their tails between their legs, heads bowed lower than usual, whispering to each other, obviously forgetting their earlier dispute. Bonita and Fernando could be heard a few minutes later, playing together without another care, their innocent minds easily moving past terrible things, shielding them from such problems their sister was burdened with. Nina's siblings were quite aware that food was not easy to come by, and knew that she was busy, even if sometimes they forgot. But none of them really knew how often she went hungry to give them something to eat. But now the pale man sat there, watching her day in and day out, noticing when she handed the others plates and kept none for herself, taking careful watch on how many days she went without eating at all, and how often she only ate a small portion of what she gave to each child and himself. He was mostly silent, a spectator in her home, a ghost if you will. But he was kind, and good with her small siblings when they chose to bother him with their trilling voices and vivid imaginations. Maria was already continuing her story, speaking of Anita's encounter, in which the dragonfly breathed a fire hotter than the sun and Anita simply squished it with a flick of her paw. The pale man seemed heavily engaged by her stories, but in reality was thinking, just as he always was. Always he seemed to be in solitude, even when others tried to reach him, such as the lovely, clever Maria. Even when Maria cried out, giggling, \"Now you are the cat!\" and he began crawling on the floor as she rode on his back, the pale man could not help feeling that a piece of him remained inside, always in reverie, always contemplating, always hungry for more things to ponder and wonder. He was there, and he was not. Nina noticed his distance, but did not mention it; she did not want to be rude to her guest, especially such a fine one as the pale man. She found him intriguing, and beautiful, despite his pale complexion and mysterious scars. He was a mystery come to life, and she had never met such a man. Though she did not admit it, she was quickly getting into a rhythm that would not allow for him to leave, acting as if she were his wife, and he her husband, though he was bedridden. He would not be so forever, and once he was not, she pretended he would stay and help her raise her brothers and sisters, help her maintain the house and the crops. She knew once he could leave, though, he most certainly would. The pale man, however, was not so sure. Though he did not seem to fit seamlessly into the home in which he now resided, he did not wish to leave. Where would he even begin to go? He had no recollection of any past, no ties to any place but the one he was currently in. Nina was the most beautiful creature he could ever remember seeing, which though it seems unimpressive, would remain his opinion for several thousand years. Though her frame was monstrously thin, her eyes sparkled with life, her hair gleamed, and her face, though tired with age beyond her years, was angelic . She was kind to her siblings, but firm when she needed to be. She was over worked and strong, but gentle. He did not want to leave Nina. He wanted to help her with the fat pigs that lived not far away, and help her get more food. Once he had his strength back, he was sure he would be able to. But he did not pretend to believe that she would allow him to continue living there, terribly pale, strange, and unknown as he was. Thus, secretly both lived in fear of losing the others company, though neither could say so. Nina, for fear of seeming desperate or overbearing, did not want to pressure him into staying. She felt selfish for even thinking about expressing this feeling to him. The pale man, on the other hand, felt it would be rude to test her hospitality. So, it was settled that when his strength returned and he could continue his unknown journey, he would do so. Maria, being a mere age of seven, did not know he would be departing so soon. She soon began calling him father, just as she had begun calling Nina mother at only age three, a year after her true mother had died. Maria knew full well Nina was her sister, and this strange guest merely that, but, as she liked to put it, that didn't matter because they lived with her and were very, very old. Nina finished the dinner and called the twins inside, then asked Maria to get her eldest brother. Maria danced to the other room, disappearing with three twirls and a giant leap, yelling as she went for Carlos to come and join them for dinner. Nina served the food evenly onto five plates, and the pale man looked at her reproachfully. She lowered her eyes as she handed the twins their meager meals. Maria returned on the back of Carlos, who then placed her carefully in her seat as she laughed madly. She started eating as soon as she got her plate, but this did not stop her from beginning an exceptionally long story about a chicken named Ernesto who ate so much magical rice it exploded and filled the world with a dark, powerful spell that sometimes caused the crops to go bad and the floods to come. Everyone at the table was enchanted by the story as they ate, all besides Nina, who did not eat anything at all. After Nina cleaned up dinner, the family went out to the fields, leaving the pale man to himself once more. This time his craving for meat did not last quite as long, and his nightmarish visions of eating greedy children were far less vivid. He did not mind so much, though he was quite confused as to what it meant. He thought of the chicken Maria had described, and wondered why it had eaten so much rice. Surely it had felt full far before it had exploded. Yet it had kept eating. He did not understand, it did not make sense. Still, he wondered if the chicken had meant to stop eating the rice, but could not bear to give the magic to anyone else. He finally decided that the chicken must have been unbearably selfish, and that he would not like to meet such a chicken, especially if it brought such ruin to all that around it and itself. Before he could grow restless and bored, it grew dark and Nina returned, shoving her siblings off to bed, all except Carlos, whom he allowed to stay awake for a short while longer. Carlos did not want much to do with the pale man, he did not trust him completely. But he did not object to the pale man being in his home, only to having to speak to him. The trio sat in silence for a while until Carlos decided he'd had enough. He left, and went to his room, mumbling something about feeling more tired than usual. The pale man did not dislike Carlos, but understood why he was wary. He was not sure if he could have accepted someone like himself if he were in Carlos's place, and was astounded by Nina's friendly disposition and blind trust. However, now that Carlos was no longer in the room, the pale man could finally confront Nina. \"You haven't eaten in three days,\" he began slowly, making sure she would not be offended by his concern. When she did not protest or respond, and merely looked down like a child caught disobeying a parent, he continued. \"It isn't healthy. I can eat less. It is not as if I do anything all day, anyway.\" His empty stomach growled as he said this, but Nina did not hear, and the pale man silently told it not to complain. \"You need to regain strength if you ever want to get out of this place. I have endured longer, I assure you,\" she replied, giving a weak, sad smile. She turned her head away, afraid to look him in the eyes. She had never admitted to going more than two days without any food to Carlos, who at twelve was aware of his sisters eating habits, and duly concerned that she would be nothing but bones soon. \"The noble lords do not allow for me to eat much. The children must eat, and so must you.\" \"You should eat,\" he said, a hint of urgency in his voice. He was worried for her. His earnestness did not travel through the air well, however. They sounded hollow and distant as they fell on Nina's ears. Still, she knew he was worried. His face held the urgency his voice was missing, and she sighed, nodding. She agreed to eat breakfast the next morning, but would not agree to eat more than that. Somewhat unsatisfied, but defeated for the moment, the pale man fell into silence, and Nina offered no more conversation. The pale man decided to gather his courage then, at least a small bit of it. He was feeling better even now, with only a few days of consciousness. He knew he would be strong enough to leave soon enough, and he wanted more time. So, he said, \"At least allow me to stay on a bit afterwards, to help repay you for your troubles. I will eat little and help in the fields, if that is alright.\" Nina's tried her best to hide her delight at his request, and, not trusting her voice to be unexcited, she nodded her consent and smiled. The pale man smiled back, and they sat in silence for another few minutes, uninterrupted, simply happy to be in each other's company. Outside, the calm happiness that had permeated through Nina's home was absent in the air. It was cold, dark, and gloomy, the clouds shutting out what should have been a hint of remaining light that makes the dusk so beautiful. Drops of rain began pounding on the rooftop, creating a melancholy song the storm seemed to sing. Suddenly a there was a flash of bright light that paled the candles, and a loud burst of thunder blasted the countryside. Nina looked over at the children's bedroom and counted down from three. On the count of one, Maria came bouncing happily into the room, proclaiming with a shriek, \"Ernesto! It's Ernesto!\" The pale man chuckled as he watched the boisterous child bounce up and down and look eagerly out the window. Nina merely gave a tired but amused sigh and got up to go towards her youngest sister. \"Now Maria,\" she began, and Maria's smile gave way to a frown, an unseemly thing on the girl's face as she anticipated rebuke and an order to go back to bed and stop making so much noise, \"I thought you told us Ernesto exploded a long time ago. How could his magic still be working?\" Maria grinned, happy her sister was playing along. Devilishly she laughed this time, knowing full well her sister was right. But then, Maria was always one to think on her feet. \"Oh yes, but that was only the first time! He comes back to eat more rice once the magic runs out, and explodes all over again!\" she looked at us again, devilish grin still spreading across her face like water spreads through a field, slowly seeping in and filling the space. \"He should not eat so much, doesn't he know that he will explode, if he has so many times? Isn't it painful?\" Nina questioned, just as enthusiastic as Maria now. \"Oh, it is very painful,\" Maria said gravely, the smile leaving her face for a serious look. \"And he knows that too, but he does not care. He wants all the magical rice for himself, so he must eat it or others will too!\" As she said this, Maria looked straight at the pale man. He thought it was probably coincidence. \"Ah, so he just wants to eat until he cannot eat anymore, Maria? How terrible,\" Nina replied, with the same mock severity. The girl giggled as if she were insane, obviously tickled by her sister's tone. \"Now go to bed Maria. Ernesto's storm won't go away very quickly, with all that rice he ate!\" \"But I want to meet Ernesto, Mommy!\" she protested loudly, waking Carlos, who gave out a groan of annoyance from the other room. \"Bed, Maria,\" Nina said more firmly. \"Ernesto will not be coming for a very long time, and it will be very late. You can meet him some other time, for he will continue to eat his rice, and will join us again.\" At that, Maria hugged Nina and the pale man, bidding her \"mother\" and \"father\" goodnight. At being addressed as such together, the eldest of the household blushed slightly, though it was more pronounced on the latter with his pale complexion, and Nina kissed her forehead, pushing her in the direction of the bedroom. The door closed, Carlos groaned again, and then they were alone once more. The rain still pounded angrily on the building, and every once in a while the storm would cast an eerie light and a terrible noise. Only twice did they hear Maria shriek. By the third boom, it could safely be assumed that she was asleep. That third boom was when Nina and her guest relaxed, knowing they would not be interrupted by small pattering feet once more. The pair talked only for a few minutes. Nina was exhausted from the day's work, and, not having eaten in quite a few days, was weak with hunger. However, she did rather enjoy speaking with him, and did not wish to go to bed right away. Their conversation was spoken in low, hushed tones, so they would not wake the others, and so they had to sit rather closely to hear each other over the rain and thunder. They were happy together, speaking like old friends, laughing at the wonderful mind of Maria, and marveling at the twins' arguments. Maria soon yawned, however, which signaled the end of their conversation. However, when Nina reached the door to her bedroom, she turned to look back at the Pale Man, and smiled. She then waltzed into her bedroom and closed the door. The Pale Man smiled too, and fell into a deep sleep, and dreamt of the taste of meat and blood. A/N: Yeah so the romance is kind of abrupt. But this is like, olden times. People got married at like fourteen years old (Nina's somewhere near nineteen or twenty by the way) and usually it was an arranged marriage or something. Marry for money or convenience. And the ending is fun, no? NOW REVIEW!!!!!!!!!![Chapter 3] A/N: Don't kill me with his name. He was name-less. It was getting SO ANNOYING. And slightly confusing. So I wanted to give him a name that the somewhat illiterate townspeople would come up with, especially since some of them had some not so nice opinions of him. So i took the Spanish word for light and added an \"O\" at the end. DEAL WITH IT. :D Reviews are so appreciated it's not even funny. Seriously people. I love your reviews. They keep the chapters coming. Every day I check my email, and if I have a new review, I say \"Ah, I should write that one more!\" and when there isn't one I say \"Well...no one cares anyway. I'll do that later.....maybe tomorrow...or the next day...or w/e.\" So Review! Disclaimer: Not mine. Never was. Never will be. Not even in another dimension. If that's how you spell it. They took to calling him Luzo. His light skin, hair, and eyes led to no other word for him if he refused to name himself. Even his slight frame agreed. The more learned of the town decided upon it. The gossip about this man, this Luzo, flew through the wind like tiny spores of a weed into all of the garden's in the small Spanish city, polluting the households and crowding the town's center. It was told he was a man from another land, a man where all the light skinned came. Others held fast to the idea that he was a fairy, come from another world, claiming no foreigner could know such Spanish and not remember their past. Certainly Spanish was his first language. Saying this led others to believe that his mother had dropped him in a vat of milk as a very young baby, and he had taken his bath in milk so much that the darkness of his skin, hair, and eyes had seeped from him, leaving him the pale wreck he now was. Stranger still was the tale that this man was a monster, come to ruin them all. Yet the monster Lito was the most popular story among the commoners. Aristocrats, choosing not to believe such silly ghost stories, decided the story of milk made most sense. If one spent enough time bathing in milk, would not one lighten? Fewer still believed the man was a God, come to save them from illness and famine. These rumors reached the ears of the household within which he resided, but none were fazed. Nina allowed rumors to roll off her shoulders like rain in the fields, knowing that no town gossip could be too credible. At the death of her parents, they had speculated the pair had been murdered in their sleep by little Carlos in jealousy of Maria, or worse yet Maria herself. Other rumors had circulated claiming that her parents had not died at all, simply left so that they would not have so many mouths to feed, none to feed but their own. Those that liked her parents, and knew and respected them, thought that these were silly. The rumors they believed said her parents had died mysteriously, as if from a spell, and without warning. After all, they had not seemed sick, only two days before. None of these were true, and so Nina learned early not to listen to the people of the town, not to let them bother her. Lito did seem a fitting name though, and so he became Luzo, even to them. He did not mind it, and it was easier than calling him Pale Man, which was a bit of a mouthful. It had been long enough, though, since he had been a resident on their small farm, for the rumors to die down from the crashing waves of a storming sea to the lapping ones of a calm beach, roars of a lion into the whispers of the breeze. They continued circulating, but he stopped receiving obvious stares and harsh whispers whenever he stepped a foot beyond the door. At least two weeks since Ernesto's storm had passed, and Luzo was healing nicely. He helped Nina and her siblings in the fields regularly, and helped raise the younger ones. Carlos even had begun to accept him, becoming less wary. He was no longer simply another mouth to feed, which helped coax the eldest boy of the family to like him better. He often helped stop the endless bickering between his younger siblings, which also improved his opinion. For once in Carlos's life, his house could be peaceful, if not quiet. Nothing was ever quiet with little Maria running about, gleefully giggling at the slightest of provocation. Dun rooms were lightened by her presence, her boisterous energy and bubbling imagination. All were affected by it, no matter who came to visit. The second they laid eyes on the child, a new life sprang to their eyes, a younger, more hopeful expression that lasted only the few seconds they looked upon her. When she wasn't laughing wildly, she was spinning fantastic stories of journey's to other worlds, and the punishment of those that took more than they ought. Obviously her sister hadn't entirely kept her siblings in the dark about the evils of the aristocrats. No one knew where her energy came from, where she was storing it all. With so little food, surely she should get tired a bit easier? Luzo wondered what she would be like if there was plenty to eat, and she could receive all the meat and fruit in all of Spain. He laughed at the thought of the young girl running in circles and doing all sorts of complicated acrobatics. The twins were finding that the less they bickered, the far less tired they would have to be. They were coming to like each other a bit more, even. Fernando tried his best not to pick on his sister, and she in turn tried to be nicer to him, now that Luzo had them under his strange, strikingly blue, watchful eyes. Their harmony at first disconcerted Nina. She was worried they had grown ill, or something terrible had happened that they would not speak of. In the end, she realized the truth; having Lito around made raising the children and making sure they had enough to eat a little more bearable. Before, she had been only one. The twins didn't respect Carlos as an elder, he'd been too young when their parents died, he'd been their playmate, just as dependant as they. Nina was the only disciplinary figure in the household, and she had to attend to keeping them alive as well, not just keeping them from bickering. So, the two had grown into a discord, not realizing what a beautiful dissonance could be created from their seemingly opposite personalities. Now, kept at bay from torturing one another, they could be left on their own, and get along. More or less, that is. The occasional spat, however, ended with both sets of wide, young eyes staring into the eerily light ones of the tall man they now grew accustomed to seeing every day, begging for forgiveness in mere expression. He had talked to both of them, and had tried to explain the hardships they put upon their eldest sister when they fought so. They understood. And now that they understood, regret and remorse covered their faces whenever they were caught raising their voices to one another. Carlos was strong-willed, and though unused to having an older man in his household for such a length of time, willed himself to like this new stranger. He could neither ignore nor deny the odd look his sister got on her face when he drew near, and the utter need his family had for his presence. So he tried his best not to be perturbed by the slight, white figure and piercing blue eyes. He had small conversations with Luzo, and usually they ended in laughter and sly comment. They worked well in the field together, and Carlos was finding it far less irritating to have him around when the meals grew a bit larger, though he was angry that his sister found the extra food for her siblings and still went days without eating herself. The resentment was not of Luzo, though, whom he heard scolding her for her neglect of her own needs. The two chided her as much as opportunity allowed. They did not want the twins or Maria knowing what Nina was doing. Especially when there was now so much peace within the house, which Carlos had missed more than meals since his parents passing. Even in poverty and hunger, the family was prospering. Still, Luzo was troubled. A growing hunger had enveloped him. There was so much he wanted that was just out of reach. Firstly, a nice piece of meat. For unexplainable reasons, he experienced these cravings often, and longingly looked upon the few livestock Nina had been able to keep, wishing he could take them for himself, then hurriedly changing the subject in his mind. These thoughts scared him. These cravings, he did not understand. Sometimes, Luzo believed the rumors that swirled about his home, believed that he was indeed a monster come to ruin them all. This hunger could not be assuaged, but it could be ignored. For now. But for how long? Such a thought always rang through his mind. Secondly, there was Nina. Quickly he fell for the beautiful young girl who had become his savior and his friend. Such a girl should be married by now, surely. But with the situation as it was, it had been impossible. She refused to marry the one man who offered, a young aristocrat who offered his condolences for her loss and asked for her hand in marriage in the same breath. Distraught, she had not thought of future prospects or possibilities. She had not thought of what comfort this might have brought to her family, she thought only of how vulgar this man was, and how insulting it would be to accept such an offer when mourning the dead. So she had refused, and the next day the young man had been accepted by another from her village, another wealthy aristocrat. They matched each other. Ugly, corpulent beings as they were. Nina had shared this story upon his inquiry with a bitter smile and a caustic laugh. Where would they all be now, she wondered, if she had taken the grubby hand of such a man? Then, her eyes ablaze, she had smiled sweetly at him, and, to his perception, coyly, and said, \"I'd much rather have waited for a lighter man.\" She'd then turned quickly and almost giddily run towards the fields. At this Luzo had paled, and then blushed, wondering wildly if she had been trying to be funny, or if she really meant it. He had run after her, laughing, a trail of children following him. Carlos had shook his head and smiled, walking at his own pace and watching with amusement. Luzo would have very much loved to propose to Nina. In fact, propriety dictated it. He lived with her in her house, yet they were unmarried. Yet, he was unsure. The strange suspicions, his overwhelming longing, these things terrorized his mind, and made him wonder how long he would be able to resist. How could he ask Nina to marry him, knowing these things? So he waited. On this particular morning, Nina moved slowly around the house, eyes lifeless and glossy. She yawned, holding up her hand to her mouth absent-mindedly, other hand busy cleaning around the house. Exhaustion was plain on her face, her mouth laying limp, her limbs sluggish. To Luzo's dissatisfied eye, she looked like the walking dead. He walked to her and put a hand to her chin, watching her eyes jolt in shock. He smiled sadly, saying \"Nina, please. Sit a minute. Sleep a bit. Surely you slept a little last night? You don't look like you have. I'll clean. Go.\" What began as a request had slowly morphed into an order, a command that she get rest. She shook her head, opening her eyes a bit wider. \"I'm fine, Luzo. I'll be awake once I've had a bit of water,\" she said, forcing her mouth into a weak smile. His reply was swift and loud with finality, \"Have a bit of food, at least. You'll need it, by the look of you. You're dead on your feet.\" At this, she defiantly raised her slack figure to a military posture, smiled as brightly as she could manage, and opened her eyes to an unnatural degree. She looked as if she'd just seen a ghost. Her transformation made Luzo laugh. Maria pranced into the room, giggling herself. \"My sister is so funny,\" she squealed, \"that she makes the Pale Man laugh! Tell me, Daddy, is she funnier than me?\" Maria had come to a stop just before Luzo, tugging on his clothes. \"No one is funnier than you, Maria,\" he answered with a flash of white teeth. She danced outside, off to play a fun game in her own imaginative world. With a last reproachful look at Nina, Luzo went to wake up the other children so that they could be ready for breakfast, and then right to work. It was a routine they had devised. Maria was usually awake before anyone came to get her, of course. She was always the first to wake, the last of the children to sleep, and the one with the most energy of any of them. No one really understood where she got all of it. She just always seemed to be moving, a constant stream of fluid motion and noise. And, as annoying as that sounded, she was a delight to all that saw her. Carlos groaned at the light nudging and low words, and the twins yawned in near unison. Still, they were up, and Luzo went back to the kitchen, where Nina was fixing a light breakfast, none of which she would eat herself. Luzo would also skip this meal. He was the healthiest of them all now, and strong enough to skip a meal here or there. He could afford to lose more meals than Nina, though she would not admit it. When breakfast began, the family sat at the table and ate in what could have been considered silence had Maria not been chattering away at speeds that far surpassed any normal conversation by a mile. They were all tired, and Maria's one-sided conversation was enough to keep them happy. The meal was small, and Nina and Luzo didn't even pretend that they had eaten. Neither had the energy. So, in the midst of a marvelous tale of fairies and monsters, Maria suddenly cried out, \"Mommy, why aren't you eating anymore? Aren't you hungry?\" This startled everyone at the table, and a hush fell over the entire party. Maria didn't seem to notice, staring up at Nina with large, questioning eyes and a wistful expression. Either she didn't notice, or she didn't care. There was silence for an uncomfortable twenty odd seconds, and then Carlos slammed his plate down on the table in front of Nina. \"You heard the girl!\" he cried, livid. \"Eat something!\" His eyes were now blazing with the look Nina often got when speaking of the aristocrats. It was a look Carlos seldom ever held, one of passion and heat. Nina was even more shocked now, unable to form a coherent response. She came out of her daze like someone comes out of a deep sleep, slow and groggy. Eventually, she decided the best response would be anger. She stood from the table regally, held her head high, looked sternly at all of the children, glared for a moment at Carlos, and walked from the table like a slighted queen. Dumbfounded, the children all stared at me, looking for what to do. I motioned for them to continue eating, and all but Maria complied. She refused to eat another bite. Hot tears of frustration rose to her eyes, overflowing one at a time onto her face, creating little patterns of water down her cheeks, like winding rivers. She wouldn't speak, nor would she move from her tight position of crossed arms and legs in her chair. Luzo sighed and hugged her awkwardly, then left her to the care of her older siblings. He had to tend to Nina's temper. Nina stood, spine erect, in the next room, face to the corner, shoulders square. Her head was held high, but as Luzo drew nearer he could see her shoulders shake. He put a pale, wary hand on her shoulder, then put the other hand on her other shoulder, holding her firmly, but far away. She grabbed his hand in hers, holding it in a vice grip, trying to get a hold on herself. Eventually her grip loosened, and she removed her hand, wiping her eyes hurriedly and taking a deep, shaking breath. Suddenly, she said, \"Maria was crying.\" \"So were you,\" he pointed out. She turned, her eyes bloodshot, but confident and dry. Her reply was sharp and robotic. \"It doesn't matter. Maria is so little…\" Luzo grabbed her shoulders once more, shaking her slightly, \"So are you, because you refuse to eat. You're skin and bone, even Maria can see it. Don't think you're fooling anyone, Nina. The twins don't say anything because they are afraid. Maria just did, because she doesn't understand. Carlos and I…we are concerned. We want you to be healthy.\" Her eyes moved downwards to stare at the floor at these words. \"They are more important,\" she answered bluntly, as if that solved all the problems. Confident in her resolve once more, she met his eyes again, this time with an even stronger air of stubbornness. \"And without you, where would they be?\" he asked, trying desperately to make her see what she did for them. Her smile was sad and cynical. He grimaced at the expression. \"With you. You'd do fine with them, I know they would. You wouldn't abandon poor little Maria, would you?\" This ended the conversation. He sighed loudly in frustration, but released her. She was right. If Nina was gone, Luzo would do whatever it took to keep the family together and safe. Regardless of the cost to himself. He could never abandon the motley assortment of children that sat in the kitchen, eating that meager morsel of a breakfast and comforting the youngest. What could he argue? He did not know at the time. When he followed Nina back into the kitchen, Maria was chattering wildly again, Carlos was attacking what was left on his plate that he had meant for his sister viciously, and the twins were giggling at Maria's antics. Though Carlos's attitude was ruined, most likely for the rest of the day, everything would be alright. Maria was a resilient child, and not very easily upset. Her recovery was nearly instant, probably from the moment she saw her sister walk through the kitchen door. The twins were happy to pretend nothing was wrong. So, in essence, all was well for them. Lito smiled at their innocence. He wished for a moment to return to such a state, such a state as he never remembered being. His past was still a mystery to him. Later, they went to the fields to work. He watched Nina intently, her supple, fragile muscles moving gracefully, glaring at him, the only meat on her gaunt body. Her eyes turned hazy as she worked, and a sort of dizzy smile appeared on her face, elated by her work with the land, bringing food to her siblings, providing for them as she would her own children. She enjoyed her work because it brought so much to others, though it merely took what little energy she had, and gave nothing back to her, as she would not eat the food, or at least not often. Selflessness, that was his Nina. Her caramel skin glistened with sweat. She smiled more brightly towards him while she realized he was staring. The pair was silent as they worked. They did not need to speak, they simply enjoyed themselves. For he too enjoyed this work, he wanted to help her, to help the prancing, giggling children that ran about the fields, playing as they worked. They shared happy glances and bright smiles, but never exchanged words. They both saw the love that threatened to shatter the lived of all in the family, the love that neither could deny, the love that he was afraid of, and that she desperately needed. It was seen, but never spoken. It was during these long hours that they felt truly like a married couple. There need be no pretense when the conversation is unspoken. They enjoyed each other's presence, laughed at Maria and the twins, looked proudly towards Carlos. He thought Nina was most beautiful when she worked. She gained a sort of connection to the earth itself, a part of the land. Her hair waved about in the wind, and fused with it. Her movements flowed with the movement of the dirt that swirled about and the swaying of the crops. And she could see that he thought so, he told her so with his eyes, gleaming with admiration. These long, arduous hours of true happiness lasted only until lunch, however, when they needed to speak. The spell broken, things were less intimate. Suddenly he was a house guest again. It was after lunch, back out in the fields for just a bit longer before the children took some time to play and the trio of adults would care after other matters, that they came. The sun was lowering in the sky, and long, dark shadows were cast on the ground in the guise of demons, tall and distorted. The children danced about, making little puppets with their hands and laughing at their strange creations. Luzo and Nina were sharing their peaceful love in their silence. Carlos tried to help entertain the children, occasionally speaking to Nina and Luzo, though wishing to not interrupt. The dirt road shone in the waning light, and two figures came slowly from the distance. They walked without haste, and with much purpose. Their clothes, regrettably, were expensive and gaudy. Their dark skin was covered with jewels and ornaments, and their corpulence was apparent from a long way away. Obviously well fed and well dressed, to the small, broken family, this visit could mean anything. The whole of them stopped everything. Even Maria managed to keep herself quiet as the dreary pair somberly approached. Once they were near, it was easier to distinguish their exact personage. The woman was bovine in structure, her eyes large and drooping, her hips the same width as her waist and bodice, her grubby fingers short. She wore an immense amount of jewelry, each gaudy piece glinting in the late afternoon sunlight, sending a shimmer of blinding sparkles in every direction. She wore a dress of a distasteful, bright purple that clung to her hips and spread wide in a hoop skirt. Her hair was done up in a complex design that resembled a bee's nest. She held her head high, her pompous nature showing through every pore on her large body. Her husband was equally large, perhaps more so, and his eyes were like a fish. His mouth stuck out slightly, perpetually in a frowning pout that made him seem like each moment of his life was filled with anger. Heavy brows rested over his beady fish eyes like furry caterpillars. He was equally well dressed, but did not have any jewels or jewelry save a single ruby on his simple gold band. \"We had to see for ourselves,\" the man said, without bothering to introduce either himself or what the family assumed to be his wife, \"this…atrocity.\" The man stepped forward, standing a breaths width away from Luzo, staring up at his tall person. The man was short to begin with, and Luzo stood well above most men. \"This Pale Man. What is this, Patricia, do you think? This abomination?\" Her voice was shrill and many octaves above what would have been the immediate assumption of her tone as she said, \"Oh, of course darling. Abomination is just the word. They are calling him Luzo, are they not? Oh, how repulsive. Not proper at all for a lady of my stature.\" The family glared at the pair now, recovered fully from their initial awe and shock. Maria's stare was the coldest and hardest of all. \"Now, Patricia, has your poor weak heart had all it can take? I do not blame you. Such things are not meant to be looked at long. Come along dear.\" And without another word, the Baron and the Baroness left the family as if they had never visited. The silence hung about the land long after they had disappeared over the horizon. Luzo's hands shook. Nina's eyes burned. Carlos's teeth clenched. The twins held each other's shoulders, eyes glaring off in the distance. Maria's fists tightened. The tension rose for an immeasurable amount of time as they stood there, unmoving. The indignity of the situation had struck more than a few nerves of each of them. And their blatant discrimination against Luzo enraged them all. Not a word was spoken. \"Bastards…\" Carlos muttered under his breath. Nina's head snapped to him. She lost it. \"Carlos! The children!\" she hissed, unable to control herself. \"They've heard worse from you, Nina!\" \"Do you think I'm proud of it? I stopped that a long time ago!\" \"Well you shouldn't tell me not to say what you've said every day since our parents died!\" \"Get inside, now, Carlos!\" \"Telling me what to do, sister? I own you until you're married!\" Once this was said, everything stopped, except the now audible wails of Maria. Carlos's eyes widened in regret and fear. In her rage she was visibly shaking. Maria ran to the house. No one stopped her. No one else moved or said anything. Luzo stood staring, unsure of whether to attempt to aid Carlos or calm Nina. The twins stared at their own feet, shifting uncomfortably. Carlos was frozen, rooted to the spot in which he stood, unable to move his hands from the awkward position next to his chest that he held them. To everyone's surprise, Nina's voice was calm. \"Carlos, please go inside,\" she whispered politely. Carlos obeyed, racing to the door, releasing his frustration in the activity. Nina's eyes welled with tears for the second time that day. She asked the twins to follow Carlos, and they too hastily went inside. Nina stared at Luzo, angry and hurt. \"I could kill him,\" she said, \"and it kills me.\" Luzo went to her and drew her into a soft embrace. She did not sob, simply let tears fall from her eyes for a while. When she was ready, she swallowed a few times and drew away from his arms, drying her eyes as she walked back to the house, ready once again to face her siblings. The scene inside was similar to the one that had been taking place with Nina. Carlos held Maria close to him, soothing her in soft tones, while the twins hung close by, seemingly attached to each other. They all looked up at her as she entered, a weary look on her face, her eyes reddened and her smile weak. Bonita was first to smile back. Then Fernando. Maria's watery smile was the brightest of them all. Carlos looked away, ashamed. Bonita touched his shoulder, then went to hug her eldest sibling. Nina stroked her hair, murmuring her apologies. Fernando gave a brief hug, and Nina mussed his hair playfully. Maria bounced over to her for her own hug and personal apology. Carlos stayed behind, still unable to look his sister in the eye. \"Carlos…\" Nina sadly chimed. Carlos nodded curtly in response. \"Carlos, look at me.\" He turned his face, but kept his eyes fixed on her nose for a few seconds. Then, looking her straight in the eye, he said clear as crystal \"I'm sorry.\" She went to him then, sure he would not move to her, and embraced him tightly. \"You are forgiven, you silly little thing. And don't object, Mr. Man of the House, to being called little, for compared to Luzo you are but a small boy!\" Laughter ensued, and Luzo placed Maria on his shoulders, and the mood lightened greatly. The Baron was never mentioned again, and neither was the outburst from Nina and Carlos. The family knew there was no need. All were forgiven, no more need for regret or anger. The Baron would not be returning to their home, not for a long time at least, and so there was no use dwelling on that either. So the family restored peace once more, forgetting the fat pigs in their pretty houses, forgetting the fat pigs in the yard, forgetting the tears and the arguments. There was no need for such things when life was so wonderful. So at dinner time, the mood was light as Luzo's pale skin and blue eyes. Maria chattered, Luzo and Carlos chatted, and the twins played with Nina. All would have been well, had Nina eaten more than a mouthful of food. Why was she still starving herself, Luzo wondered, when they were finally gaining enough crop to keep for the entire family, including Nina? Why did she sacrifice when there was no need? It was unclear. He stopped asking. She never gave a clear answer, never really knew why. It was almost a reflex for her now. She felt guilty for taking more than she absolutely needed to survive. Not what she needed to be healthy. Just enough to keep herself moving. So she nothing at all most meals, and very little on the seldom that she did eat. Luzo wondered how long she had tempted fate in this manner. He wondered how should could still work. Still, the light mood carried over to the evening, and Maria almost refused to go to sleep at the end of the day. There was much laughing from everyone, Carlos's eyes smiled even when his lips did not, enjoying the beautiful, warm evening in a way he had not imagined ever being able to do, with the burdon of his family on him and his older sister. Maria made a point of paying close attention to Carlos. She stuck by him all night, determined to keep the smile in his eyes. It was her opinion that Carlos needed laughter the most. Without it, he was cold. She wanted him to be the warm, happy brother he had been. The one she missed. And when she saw him coming back, she held fast. The twins kept trying to steal her away, but Luzo and Nina kept their attention well enough. Carlos was happy. Maria was happy. Everyone in the family was, oddly enough. Their day was too horrible to be in bad spirits. Finally, they managed to calm everyone down. Carlos was first to bed, as usual, yawning and stretching, then giving Nina and Luzo a pointed look as he left the room. The twins were soon to follow, ghosts of their laughter etched on their tired features. Maria skipped off to bed, after much coaxing. Leaving Luzo and Nina alone, as was the routine. This was the other time that they could be together in the way they wanted. No children around, no Carlos, no one but themselves and each other. A certain calm swept over the house as the others crept slowly into sleep. The dark made it difficult to see, once the lights were off, but Luzo's pale skin shone in the residual light. Nina smiled faintly in the shadows. Luzo smiled back. They were happy, and, now that they could admit it, alone in the dark, in love. Luzo moved closer to her, sitting close to her, but apart. Their fingers barely touched. Yet they felt an intimacy that could not be reached through open affection. Their love was secret, even from themselves. It was an easily realized dream, but the consequences were fearful. Would the children accept it? Would Carlos? What would become of them if they married? Would the townsfolk wish to kill him for marrying someone so normal? They thought he was a demon. If they thought Nina was too, they might want to take Maria and the twins away. Maria would be resentful. Bonita would not understand. Fernando would fight back. It was a scene they wished to avoid at all costs. Carlos would them for it. So they shared this and this only. Never any more And their respite was short lived. Maria lifted her hand and smiled weakly once more. A shaking hand grasped Luzo's shoulder. Startled, he grabbed it, trying to steady it. She pulled away, saying she was simply tired. He stared after her retreating figure as it walked into the bedroom, eyes wide. She was shaking. Shaking. And still she denied anything was wrong. She couldn't go on like this. He had to do something about it. He sat for a long time, hearing the even breaths of his family, knowing they were fast asleep. Carlos snored loudly, but they were very heavy sleepers. Even jittery little Maria could sleep through very loud noises, unless it was a storm. Suddenly he was overcome by both of his impulsive hungers. He wanted Nina, and he wanted a feast of meat. He was dizzy, he felt sick. His breaths were short and ragged, drinking in the air to steady his stomach. It didn't help. He got up, and stumbled forward, turning to the door, his dizziness worsening, his stomach clenching. His eyes were seeing red, and his minds' eye was seeing Nina. He panicked and race to the door, exiting the house and finally falling to the ground, hands out in front of him, eyes shut tight. As sudden as it had come, it stopped. Luzo sat on the ground, panting, hands over his face. Tremors ripped through his body. He felt immeasurably weak. He imagined idly that Nina must feel similarly all the time. Still shaking, and still a bit nauseous, Luzo went back inside. He lay down, tried to sleep, and hoped the nausea would leave him. However, it did not for a long time, and he was unsettled by this occurrence. He had never felt that way before, nor did he want to repeat the experience. He didn't know what had brought it on, nor did he know how it had stopped. It was unpredictable, could come back at any time. He was helpless. If they were to see him? What would they think? Sleep did not come for a very long time. But sleep did come. Dreamless, restless sleep, that was interrupted every so often by a wave of nausea, until that, too, finally passed. That was when he dreamt. A beautiful woman with sweet smelling hair held a beautiful baby girl. The child was paler than the mother, the complexion instead of light caramel more of a light tan. Still, the child was beautiful. She smiled at him, as did the mother, Nina. Suddenly Carlos was there, laughing and smiling. All were rejoicing in his baby girl, his and Nina's. An older, more womanly Maria danced playfully around the child. Bonita and Fernando cooed at her and congratulated the parents. It was the sweetest dream Luzo had had since he could remember. He took the baby in his arms, and kissed it on the nose. But when he brought the child to his face, a succulent scent tickled his nose. He went into a frenzy, and consumed the child. He wanted more, more, more. He took up Maria, then Bonita. Then he ate Fernando and Carlos. Nina stood screaming, and began to flee. But she was so thin, so weak. He caught her and ate her up, too. Then, he exploded into a thousand pieces. His flesh was torn, his bones broke, everything pulled apart in an agonizing process that made a loud boom. He was startled into consciousness, cold sweat forming on his brow. He wondered if a demon could be a demon and not know it. He wondered if some rumors were true, and if someone who looked like an abomination could keep from being one. Lastly, he wondered what Nina would make for breakfast that morning. A/N: There you have it, my longest chapter yet. We're about to get to some good stuff, people. Good stuff. So review if you want good stuff FASTER! Reviewing makes the world go round, and makes me neglect my homework to write fanfiction. So please review. I don't like homework. If you were wondering at all why I write two author's notes, it's because I hope that if I write two, at least ONE OF THEM will be read. Maybe. It's probably a false hope. But hey, you know what, it's worth a shot.","LastChapter":"A/N: Don't kill me with his name. He was name-less. It was getting SO ANNOYING. And slightly confusing. So I wanted to give him a name that the somewhat illiterate townspeople would come up with, especially since some of them had some not so nice opinions of him. So i took the Spanish word for light and added an \"O\" at the end. DEAL WITH IT. :D Reviews are so appreciated it's not even funny. Seriously people. I love your reviews. They keep the chapters coming. Every day I check my email, and if I have a new review, I say \"Ah, I should write that one more!\" and when there isn't one I say \"Well...no one cares anyway. I'll do that later.....maybe tomorrow...or the next day...or w/e.\" So Review! Disclaimer: Not mine. Never was. Never will be. Not even in another dimension. If that's how you spell it. They took to calling him Luzo. His light skin, hair, and eyes led to no other word for him if he refused to name himself. Even his slight frame agreed. The more learned of the town decided upon it. The gossip about this man, this Luzo, flew through the wind like tiny spores of a weed into all of the garden's in the small Spanish city, polluting the households and crowding the town's center. It was told he was a man from another land, a man where all the light skinned came. Others held fast to the idea that he was a fairy, come from another world, claiming no foreigner could know such Spanish and not remember their past. Certainly Spanish was his first language. Saying this led others to believe that his mother had dropped him in a vat of milk as a very young baby, and he had taken his bath in milk so much that the darkness of his skin, hair, and eyes had seeped from him, leaving him the pale wreck he now was. Stranger still was the tale that this man was a monster, come to ruin them all. Yet the monster Lito was the most popular story among the commoners. Aristocrats, choosing not to believe such silly ghost stories, decided the story of milk made most sense. If one spent enough time bathing in milk, would not one lighten? Fewer still believed the man was a God, come to save them from illness and famine. These rumors reached the ears of the household within which he resided, but none were fazed. Nina allowed rumors to roll off her shoulders like rain in the fields, knowing that no town gossip could be too credible. At the death of her parents, they had speculated the pair had been murdered in their sleep by little Carlos in jealousy of Maria, or worse yet Maria herself. Other rumors had circulated claiming that her parents had not died at all, simply left so that they would not have so many mouths to feed, none to feed but their own. Those that liked her parents, and knew and respected them, thought that these were silly. The rumors they believed said her parents had died mysteriously, as if from a spell, and without warning. After all, they had not seemed sick, only two days before. None of these were true, and so Nina learned early not to listen to the people of the town, not to let them bother her. Lito did seem a fitting name though, and so he became Luzo, even to them. He did not mind it, and it was easier than calling him Pale Man, which was a bit of a mouthful. It had been long enough, though, since he had been a resident on their small farm, for the rumors to die down from the crashing waves of a storming sea to the lapping ones of a calm beach, roars of a lion into the whispers of the breeze. They continued circulating, but he stopped receiving obvious stares and harsh whispers whenever he stepped a foot beyond the door. At least two weeks since Ernesto's storm had passed, and Luzo was healing nicely. He helped Nina and her siblings in the fields regularly, and helped raise the younger ones. Carlos even had begun to accept him, becoming less wary. He was no longer simply another mouth to feed, which helped coax the eldest boy of the family to like him better. He often helped stop the endless bickering between his younger siblings, which also improved his opinion. For once in Carlos's life, his house could be peaceful, if not quiet. Nothing was ever quiet with little Maria running about, gleefully giggling at the slightest of provocation. Dun rooms were lightened by her presence, her boisterous energy and bubbling imagination. All were affected by it, no matter who came to visit. The second they laid eyes on the child, a new life sprang to their eyes, a younger, more hopeful expression that lasted only the few seconds they looked upon her. When she wasn't laughing wildly, she was spinning fantastic stories of journey's to other worlds, and the punishment of those that took more than they ought. Obviously her sister hadn't entirely kept her siblings in the dark about the evils of the aristocrats. No one knew where her energy came from, where she was storing it all. With so little food, surely she should get tired a bit easier? Luzo wondered what she would be like if there was plenty to eat, and she could receive all the meat and fruit in all of Spain. He laughed at the thought of the young girl running in circles and doing all sorts of complicated acrobatics. The twins were finding that the less they bickered, the far less tired they would have to be. They were coming to like each other a bit more, even. Fernando tried his best not to pick on his sister, and she in turn tried to be nicer to him, now that Luzo had them under his strange, strikingly blue, watchful eyes. Their harmony at first disconcerted Nina. She was worried they had grown ill, or something terrible had happened that they would not speak of. In the end, she realized the truth; having Lito around made raising the children and making sure they had enough to eat a little more bearable. Before, she had been only one. The twins didn't respect Carlos as an elder, he'd been too young when their parents died, he'd been their playmate, just as dependant as they. Nina was the only disciplinary figure in the household, and she had to attend to keeping them alive as well, not just keeping them from bickering. So, the two had grown into a discord, not realizing what a beautiful dissonance could be created from their seemingly opposite personalities. Now, kept at bay from torturing one another, they could be left on their own, and get along. More or less, that is. The occasional spat, however, ended with both sets of wide, young eyes staring into the eerily light ones of the tall man they now grew accustomed to seeing every day, begging for forgiveness in mere expression. He had talked to both of them, and had tried to explain the hardships they put upon their eldest sister when they fought so. They understood. And now that they understood, regret and remorse covered their faces whenever they were caught raising their voices to one another. Carlos was strong-willed, and though unused to having an older man in his household for such a length of time, willed himself to like this new stranger. He could neither ignore nor deny the odd look his sister got on her face when he drew near, and the utter need his family had for his presence. So he tried his best not to be perturbed by the slight, white figure and piercing blue eyes. He had small conversations with Luzo, and usually they ended in laughter and sly comment. They worked well in the field together, and Carlos was finding it far less irritating to have him around when the meals grew a bit larger, though he was angry that his sister found the extra food for her siblings and still went days without eating herself. The resentment was not of Luzo, though, whom he heard scolding her for her neglect of her own needs. The two chided her as much as opportunity allowed. They did not want the twins or Maria knowing what Nina was doing. Especially when there was now so much peace within the house, which Carlos had missed more than meals since his parents passing. Even in poverty and hunger, the family was prospering. Still, Luzo was troubled. A growing hunger had enveloped him. There was so much he wanted that was just out of reach. Firstly, a nice piece of meat. For unexplainable reasons, he experienced these cravings often, and longingly looked upon the few livestock Nina had been able to keep, wishing he could take them for himself, then hurriedly changing the subject in his mind. These thoughts scared him. These cravings, he did not understand. Sometimes, Luzo believed the rumors that swirled about his home, believed that he was indeed a monster come to ruin them all. This hunger could not be assuaged, but it could be ignored. For now. But for how long? Such a thought always rang through his mind. Secondly, there was Nina. Quickly he fell for the beautiful young girl who had become his savior and his friend. Such a girl should be married by now, surely. But with the situation as it was, it had been impossible. She refused to marry the one man who offered, a young aristocrat who offered his condolences for her loss and asked for her hand in marriage in the same breath. Distraught, she had not thought of future prospects or possibilities. She had not thought of what comfort this might have brought to her family, she thought only of how vulgar this man was, and how insulting it would be to accept such an offer when mourning the dead. So she had refused, and the next day the young man had been accepted by another from her village, another wealthy aristocrat. They matched each other. Ugly, corpulent beings as they were. Nina had shared this story upon his inquiry with a bitter smile and a caustic laugh. Where would they all be now, she wondered, if she had taken the grubby hand of such a man? Then, her eyes ablaze, she had smiled sweetly at him, and, to his perception, coyly, and said, \"I'd much rather have waited for a lighter man.\" She'd then turned quickly and almost giddily run towards the fields. At this Luzo had paled, and then blushed, wondering wildly if she had been trying to be funny, or if she really meant it. He had run after her, laughing, a trail of children following him. Carlos had shook his head and smiled, walking at his own pace and watching with amusement. Luzo would have very much loved to propose to Nina. In fact, propriety dictated it. He lived with her in her house, yet they were unmarried. Yet, he was unsure. The strange suspicions, his overwhelming longing, these things terrorized his mind, and made him wonder how long he would be able to resist. How could he ask Nina to marry him, knowing these things? So he waited. On this particular morning, Nina moved slowly around the house, eyes lifeless and glossy. She yawned, holding up her hand to her mouth absent-mindedly, other hand busy cleaning around the house. Exhaustion was plain on her face, her mouth laying limp, her limbs sluggish. To Luzo's dissatisfied eye, she looked like the walking dead. He walked to her and put a hand to her chin, watching her eyes jolt in shock. He smiled sadly, saying \"Nina, please. Sit a minute. Sleep a bit. Surely you slept a little last night? You don't look like you have. I'll clean. Go.\" What began as a request had slowly morphed into an order, a command that she get rest. She shook her head, opening her eyes a bit wider. \"I'm fine, Luzo. I'll be awake once I've had a bit of water,\" she said, forcing her mouth into a weak smile. His reply was swift and loud with finality, \"Have a bit of food, at least. You'll need it, by the look of you. You're dead on your feet.\" At this, she defiantly raised her slack figure to a military posture, smiled as brightly as she could manage, and opened her eyes to an unnatural degree. She looked as if she'd just seen a ghost. Her transformation made Luzo laugh. Maria pranced into the room, giggling herself. \"My sister is so funny,\" she squealed, \"that she makes the Pale Man laugh! Tell me, Daddy, is she funnier than me?\" Maria had come to a stop just before Luzo, tugging on his clothes. \"No one is funnier than you, Maria,\" he answered with a flash of white teeth. She danced outside, off to play a fun game in her own imaginative world. With a last reproachful look at Nina, Luzo went to wake up the other children so that they could be ready for breakfast, and then right to work. It was a routine they had devised. Maria was usually awake before anyone came to get her, of course. She was always the first to wake, the last of the children to sleep, and the one with the most energy of any of them. No one really understood where she got all of it. She just always seemed to be moving, a constant stream of fluid motion and noise. And, as annoying as that sounded, she was a delight to all that saw her. Carlos groaned at the light nudging and low words, and the twins yawned in near unison. Still, they were up, and Luzo went back to the kitchen, where Nina was fixing a light breakfast, none of which she would eat herself. Luzo would also skip this meal. He was the healthiest of them all now, and strong enough to skip a meal here or there. He could afford to lose more meals than Nina, though she would not admit it. When breakfast began, the family sat at the table and ate in what could have been considered silence had Maria not been chattering away at speeds that far surpassed any normal conversation by a mile. They were all tired, and Maria's one-sided conversation was enough to keep them happy. The meal was small, and Nina and Luzo didn't even pretend that they had eaten. Neither had the energy. So, in the midst of a marvelous tale of fairies and monsters, Maria suddenly cried out, \"Mommy, why aren't you eating anymore? Aren't you hungry?\" This startled everyone at the table, and a hush fell over the entire party. Maria didn't seem to notice, staring up at Nina with large, questioning eyes and a wistful expression. Either she didn't notice, or she didn't care. There was silence for an uncomfortable twenty odd seconds, and then Carlos slammed his plate down on the table in front of Nina. \"You heard the girl!\" he cried, livid. \"Eat something!\" His eyes were now blazing with the look Nina often got when speaking of the aristocrats. It was a look Carlos seldom ever held, one of passion and heat. Nina was even more shocked now, unable to form a coherent response. She came out of her daze like someone comes out of a deep sleep, slow and groggy. Eventually, she decided the best response would be anger. She stood from the table regally, held her head high, looked sternly at all of the children, glared for a moment at Carlos, and walked from the table like a slighted queen. Dumbfounded, the children all stared at me, looking for what to do. I motioned for them to continue eating, and all but Maria complied. She refused to eat another bite. Hot tears of frustration rose to her eyes, overflowing one at a time onto her face, creating little patterns of water down her cheeks, like winding rivers. She wouldn't speak, nor would she move from her tight position of crossed arms and legs in her chair. Luzo sighed and hugged her awkwardly, then left her to the care of her older siblings. He had to tend to Nina's temper. Nina stood, spine erect, in the next room, face to the corner, shoulders square. Her head was held high, but as Luzo drew nearer he could see her shoulders shake. He put a pale, wary hand on her shoulder, then put the other hand on her other shoulder, holding her firmly, but far away. She grabbed his hand in hers, holding it in a vice grip, trying to get a hold on herself. Eventually her grip loosened, and she removed her hand, wiping her eyes hurriedly and taking a deep, shaking breath. Suddenly, she said, \"Maria was crying.\" \"So were you,\" he pointed out. She turned, her eyes bloodshot, but confident and dry. Her reply was sharp and robotic. \"It doesn't matter. Maria is so little…\" Luzo grabbed her shoulders once more, shaking her slightly, \"So are you, because you refuse to eat. You're skin and bone, even Maria can see it. Don't think you're fooling anyone, Nina. The twins don't say anything because they are afraid. Maria just did, because she doesn't understand. Carlos and I…we are concerned. We want you to be healthy.\" Her eyes moved downwards to stare at the floor at these words. \"They are more important,\" she answered bluntly, as if that solved all the problems. Confident in her resolve once more, she met his eyes again, this time with an even stronger air of stubbornness. \"And without you, where would they be?\" he asked, trying desperately to make her see what she did for them. Her smile was sad and cynical. He grimaced at the expression. \"With you. You'd do fine with them, I know they would. You wouldn't abandon poor little Maria, would you?\" This ended the conversation. He sighed loudly in frustration, but released her. She was right. If Nina was gone, Luzo would do whatever it took to keep the family together and safe. Regardless of the cost to himself. He could never abandon the motley assortment of children that sat in the kitchen, eating that meager morsel of a breakfast and comforting the youngest. What could he argue? He did not know at the time. When he followed Nina back into the kitchen, Maria was chattering wildly again, Carlos was attacking what was left on his plate that he had meant for his sister viciously, and the twins were giggling at Maria's antics. Though Carlos's attitude was ruined, most likely for the rest of the day, everything would be alright. Maria was a resilient child, and not very easily upset. Her recovery was nearly instant, probably from the moment she saw her sister walk through the kitchen door. The twins were happy to pretend nothing was wrong. So, in essence, all was well for them. Lito smiled at their innocence. He wished for a moment to return to such a state, such a state as he never remembered being. His past was still a mystery to him. Later, they went to the fields to work. He watched Nina intently, her supple, fragile muscles moving gracefully, glaring at him, the only meat on her gaunt body. Her eyes turned hazy as she worked, and a sort of dizzy smile appeared on her face, elated by her work with the land, bringing food to her siblings, providing for them as she would her own children. She enjoyed her work because it brought so much to others, though it merely took what little energy she had, and gave nothing back to her, as she would not eat the food, or at least not often. Selflessness, that was his Nina. Her caramel skin glistened with sweat. She smiled more brightly towards him while she realized he was staring. The pair was silent as they worked. They did not need to speak, they simply enjoyed themselves. For he too enjoyed this work, he wanted to help her, to help the prancing, giggling children that ran about the fields, playing as they worked. They shared happy glances and bright smiles, but never exchanged words. They both saw the love that threatened to shatter the lived of all in the family, the love that neither could deny, the love that he was afraid of, and that she desperately needed. It was seen, but never spoken. It was during these long hours that they felt truly like a married couple. There need be no pretense when the conversation is unspoken. They enjoyed each other's presence, laughed at Maria and the twins, looked proudly towards Carlos. He thought Nina was most beautiful when she worked. She gained a sort of connection to the earth itself, a part of the land. Her hair waved about in the wind, and fused with it. Her movements flowed with the movement of the dirt that swirled about and the swaying of the crops. And she could see that he thought so, he told her so with his eyes, gleaming with admiration. These long, arduous hours of true happiness lasted only until lunch, however, when they needed to speak. The spell broken, things were less intimate. Suddenly he was a house guest again. It was after lunch, back out in the fields for just a bit longer before the children took some time to play and the trio of adults would care after other matters, that they came. The sun was lowering in the sky, and long, dark shadows were cast on the ground in the guise of demons, tall and distorted. The children danced about, making little puppets with their hands and laughing at their strange creations. Luzo and Nina were sharing their peaceful love in their silence. Carlos tried to help entertain the children, occasionally speaking to Nina and Luzo, though wishing to not interrupt. The dirt road shone in the waning light, and two figures came slowly from the distance. They walked without haste, and with much purpose. Their clothes, regrettably, were expensive and gaudy. Their dark skin was covered with jewels and ornaments, and their corpulence was apparent from a long way away. Obviously well fed and well dressed, to the small, broken family, this visit could mean anything. The whole of them stopped everything. Even Maria managed to keep herself quiet as the dreary pair somberly approached. Once they were near, it was easier to distinguish their exact personage. The woman was bovine in structure, her eyes large and drooping, her hips the same width as her waist and bodice, her grubby fingers short. She wore an immense amount of jewelry, each gaudy piece glinting in the late afternoon sunlight, sending a shimmer of blinding sparkles in every direction. She wore a dress of a distasteful, bright purple that clung to her hips and spread wide in a hoop skirt. Her hair was done up in a complex design that resembled a bee's nest. She held her head high, her pompous nature showing through every pore on her large body. Her husband was equally large, perhaps more so, and his eyes were like a fish. His mouth stuck out slightly, perpetually in a frowning pout that made him seem like each moment of his life was filled with anger. Heavy brows rested over his beady fish eyes like furry caterpillars. He was equally well dressed, but did not have any jewels or jewelry save a single ruby on his simple gold band. \"We had to see for ourselves,\" the man said, without bothering to introduce either himself or what the family assumed to be his wife, \"this…atrocity.\" The man stepped forward, standing a breaths width away from Luzo, staring up at his tall person. The man was short to begin with, and Luzo stood well above most men. \"This Pale Man. What is this, Patricia, do you think? This abomination?\" Her voice was shrill and many octaves above what would have been the immediate assumption of her tone as she said, \"Oh, of course darling. Abomination is just the word. They are calling him Luzo, are they not? Oh, how repulsive. Not proper at all for a lady of my stature.\" The family glared at the pair now, recovered fully from their initial awe and shock. Maria's stare was the coldest and hardest of all. \"Now, Patricia, has your poor weak heart had all it can take? I do not blame you. Such things are not meant to be looked at long. Come along dear.\" And without another word, the Baron and the Baroness left the family as if they had never visited. The silence hung about the land long after they had disappeared over the horizon. Luzo's hands shook. Nina's eyes burned. Carlos's teeth clenched. The twins held each other's shoulders, eyes glaring off in the distance. Maria's fists tightened. The tension rose for an immeasurable amount of time as they stood there, unmoving. The indignity of the situation had struck more than a few nerves of each of them. And their blatant discrimination against Luzo enraged them all. Not a word was spoken. \"Bastards…\" Carlos muttered under his breath. Nina's head snapped to him. She lost it. \"Carlos! The children!\" she hissed, unable to control herself. \"They've heard worse from you, Nina!\" \"Do you think I'm proud of it? I stopped that a long time ago!\" \"Well you shouldn't tell me not to say what you've said every day since our parents died!\" \"Get inside, now, Carlos!\" \"Telling me what to do, sister? I own you until you're married!\" Once this was said, everything stopped, except the now audible wails of Maria. Carlos's eyes widened in regret and fear. In her rage she was visibly shaking. Maria ran to the house. No one stopped her. No one else moved or said anything. Luzo stood staring, unsure of whether to attempt to aid Carlos or calm Nina. The twins stared at their own feet, shifting uncomfortably. Carlos was frozen, rooted to the spot in which he stood, unable to move his hands from the awkward position next to his chest that he held them. To everyone's surprise, Nina's voice was calm. \"Carlos, please go inside,\" she whispered politely. Carlos obeyed, racing to the door, releasing his frustration in the activity. Nina's eyes welled with tears for the second time that day. She asked the twins to follow Carlos, and they too hastily went inside. Nina stared at Luzo, angry and hurt. \"I could kill him,\" she said, \"and it kills me.\" Luzo went to her and drew her into a soft embrace. She did not sob, simply let tears fall from her eyes for a while. When she was ready, she swallowed a few times and drew away from his arms, drying her eyes as she walked back to the house, ready once again to face her siblings. The scene inside was similar to the one that had been taking place with Nina. Carlos held Maria close to him, soothing her in soft tones, while the twins hung close by, seemingly attached to each other. They all looked up at her as she entered, a weary look on her face, her eyes reddened and her smile weak. Bonita was first to smile back. Then Fernando. Maria's watery smile was the brightest of them all. Carlos looked away, ashamed. Bonita touched his shoulder, then went to hug her eldest sibling. Nina stroked her hair, murmuring her apologies. Fernando gave a brief hug, and Nina mussed his hair playfully. Maria bounced over to her for her own hug and personal apology. Carlos stayed behind, still unable to look his sister in the eye. \"Carlos…\" Nina sadly chimed. Carlos nodded curtly in response. \"Carlos, look at me.\" He turned his face, but kept his eyes fixed on her nose for a few seconds. Then, looking her straight in the eye, he said clear as crystal \"I'm sorry.\" She went to him then, sure he would not move to her, and embraced him tightly. \"You are forgiven, you silly little thing. And don't object, Mr. Man of the House, to being called little, for compared to Luzo you are but a small boy!\" Laughter ensued, and Luzo placed Maria on his shoulders, and the mood lightened greatly. The Baron was never mentioned again, and neither was the outburst from Nina and Carlos. The family knew there was no need. All were forgiven, no more need for regret or anger. The Baron would not be returning to their home, not for a long time at least, and so there was no use dwelling on that either. So the family restored peace once more, forgetting the fat pigs in their pretty houses, forgetting the fat pigs in the yard, forgetting the tears and the arguments. There was no need for such things when life was so wonderful. So at dinner time, the mood was light as Luzo's pale skin and blue eyes. Maria chattered, Luzo and Carlos chatted, and the twins played with Nina. All would have been well, had Nina eaten more than a mouthful of food. Why was she still starving herself, Luzo wondered, when they were finally gaining enough crop to keep for the entire family, including Nina? Why did she sacrifice when there was no need? It was unclear. He stopped asking. She never gave a clear answer, never really knew why. It was almost a reflex for her now. She felt guilty for taking more than she absolutely needed to survive. Not what she needed to be healthy. Just enough to keep herself moving. So she nothing at all most meals, and very little on the seldom that she did eat. Luzo wondered how long she had tempted fate in this manner. He wondered how should could still work. Still, the light mood carried over to the evening, and Maria almost refused to go to sleep at the end of the day. There was much laughing from everyone, Carlos's eyes smiled even when his lips did not, enjoying the beautiful, warm evening in a way he had not imagined ever being able to do, with the burdon of his family on him and his older sister. Maria made a point of paying close attention to Carlos. She stuck by him all night, determined to keep the smile in his eyes. It was her opinion that Carlos needed laughter the most. Without it, he was cold. She wanted him to be the warm, happy brother he had been. The one she missed. And when she saw him coming back, she held fast. The twins kept trying to steal her away, but Luzo and Nina kept their attention well enough. Carlos was happy. Maria was happy. Everyone in the family was, oddly enough. Their day was too horrible to be in bad spirits. Finally, they managed to calm everyone down. Carlos was first to bed, as usual, yawning and stretching, then giving Nina and Luzo a pointed look as he left the room. The twins were soon to follow, ghosts of their laughter etched on their tired features. Maria skipped off to bed, after much coaxing. Leaving Luzo and Nina alone, as was the routine. This was the other time that they could be together in the way they wanted. No children around, no Carlos, no one but themselves and each other. A certain calm swept over the house as the others crept slowly into sleep. The dark made it difficult to see, once the lights were off, but Luzo's pale skin shone in the residual light. Nina smiled faintly in the shadows. Luzo smiled back. They were happy, and, now that they could admit it, alone in the dark, in love. Luzo moved closer to her, sitting close to her, but apart. Their fingers barely touched. Yet they felt an intimacy that could not be reached through open affection. Their love was secret, even from themselves. It was an easily realized dream, but the consequences were fearful. Would the children accept it? Would Carlos? What would become of them if they married? Would the townsfolk wish to kill him for marrying someone so normal? They thought he was a demon. If they thought Nina was too, they might want to take Maria and the twins away. Maria would be resentful. Bonita would not understand. Fernando would fight back. It was a scene they wished to avoid at all costs. Carlos would them for it. So they shared this and this only. Never any more And their respite was short lived. Maria lifted her hand and smiled weakly once more. A shaking hand grasped Luzo's shoulder. Startled, he grabbed it, trying to steady it. She pulled away, saying she was simply tired. He stared after her retreating figure as it walked into the bedroom, eyes wide. She was shaking. Shaking. And still she denied anything was wrong. She couldn't go on like this. He had to do something about it. He sat for a long time, hearing the even breaths of his family, knowing they were fast asleep. Carlos snored loudly, but they were very heavy sleepers. Even jittery little Maria could sleep through very loud noises, unless it was a storm. Suddenly he was overcome by both of his impulsive hungers. He wanted Nina, and he wanted a feast of meat. He was dizzy, he felt sick. His breaths were short and ragged, drinking in the air to steady his stomach. It didn't help. He got up, and stumbled forward, turning to the door, his dizziness worsening, his stomach clenching. His eyes were seeing red, and his minds' eye was seeing Nina. He panicked and race to the door, exiting the house and finally falling to the ground, hands out in front of him, eyes shut tight. As sudden as it had come, it stopped. Luzo sat on the ground, panting, hands over his face. Tremors ripped through his body. He felt immeasurably weak. He imagined idly that Nina must feel similarly all the time. Still shaking, and still a bit nauseous, Luzo went back inside. He lay down, tried to sleep, and hoped the nausea would leave him. However, it did not for a long time, and he was unsettled by this occurrence. He had never felt that way before, nor did he want to repeat the experience. He didn't know what had brought it on, nor did he know how it had stopped. It was unpredictable, could come back at any time. He was helpless. If they were to see him? What would they think? Sleep did not come for a very long time. But sleep did come. Dreamless, restless sleep, that was interrupted every so often by a wave of nausea, until that, too, finally passed. That was when he dreamt. A beautiful woman with sweet smelling hair held a beautiful baby girl. The child was paler than the mother, the complexion instead of light caramel more of a light tan. Still, the child was beautiful. She smiled at him, as did the mother, Nina. Suddenly Carlos was there, laughing and smiling. All were rejoicing in his baby girl, his and Nina's. An older, more womanly Maria danced playfully around the child. Bonita and Fernando cooed at her and congratulated the parents. It was the sweetest dream Luzo had had since he could remember. He took the baby in his arms, and kissed it on the nose. But when he brought the child to his face, a succulent scent tickled his nose. He went into a frenzy, and consumed the child. He wanted more, more, more. He took up Maria, then Bonita. Then he ate Fernando and Carlos. Nina stood screaming, and began to flee. But she was so thin, so weak. He caught her and ate her up, too. Then, he exploded into a thousand pieces. His flesh was torn, his bones broke, everything pulled apart in an agonizing process that made a loud boom. He was startled into consciousness, cold sweat forming on his brow. He wondered if a demon could be a demon and not know it. He wondered if some rumors were true, and if someone who looked like an abomination could keep from being one. Lastly, he wondered what Nina would make for breakfast that morning. A/N: There you have it, my longest chapter yet. We're about to get to some good stuff, people. Good stuff. So review if you want good stuff FASTER! Reviewing makes the world go round, and makes me neglect my homework to write fanfiction. So please review. I don't like homework. If you were wondering at all why I write two author's notes, it's because I hope that if I write two, at least ONE OF THEM will be read. Maybe. It's probably a false hope. But hey, you know what, it's worth a shot.","Summary":" Disclaimer: Nothing belongs to me, except my original characters and the plotline.

Some Random Gal, back from retirement and posting again. Man I missed you all. Anyway, to business. I love Rocky. I love his personality and the way he talks. He makes me laugh a lotXD. I always dreamed of making a story of his time in his point of view. So, I achieved it. Now, I know that the title isn't very inspirational and the story might not be that great, but I think I did a good job. I also added a few scenes that aren't in the movie. Anyway, enjoy Rooster Run. Rooster Run Chapter 1 All stories begin with introduction don't they? Well, let's have one right now then. The name's Rocky Rhodes, short for the Rhode Island Red. I am a rooster, and a pretty good-looking one at that. Through my good looks, most chicks fall for my charms and stuff gets done for me. Now you all are thinking that someone as good looking as me may live a charmed life, but there is one little catch. I have a job, and I don't like it. Do you want to know what I do for a living? No? Well, I'll tell you anyway. I am a rooster who is from the circus and when I get on stage, I get shot out of a cannon . You heard me right, shot out of a cannon. And no, they do not gear my up with any safety or anything. They just stuff me in, light that fuse, and boom! There I go in a puff of black smoke and the smell of gunpowder. That's me, Rocky the \"Flying Rooster\". Yeah, my life isn't as good as I look isn't it? No it's not. Which is a shame because a handsome rooster like me deserves a better life after all I've gone through. Well, it's about time I do get that life, a higher place than the one I am living in right now. I don't care that the other circus guys think I'm nuts. 'You've got to be kidding Rocky!' They say to me. 'We get a roof over our head and fed three meals a day. I don't get why you want to leave. Or how even. You do see how well guarded this place is right?' Well, all they do is jump through rings of fire and stand on each other's heads. If they were stuffed into a cannon and shot into the air with no safety gear, I'm pretty sure their opinions would change. As for the how, this is the one time I am glad that my job is being shot out of a cannon. The next time I go on stage, they are going to get an explosion they'll never forget.[Chapter 2] Hiya everyone~ OMG an update! XD Just kidding. I've actually written this a loooooong time ago but wanted to wait a bit to see if anyone ACTUALLY reads this^^. Thank you soooooo much A. Kingsleigh. You're review made me smile. And yes, I agree, the lack of Chicken Run fics is . aggravating. So I was like \"Well! I'm gonna post a fic!\" ^^ Ayway~ Enjoy Rooster Run Chapter 2. I own nothing. Rooster Run Chapter 2 Our next show was in the country side. Good, that means that there would be no need for me to worry about running into some one when I make my escape. Now, it is stereo typical that good looking people are meant to be stupid. That is entirely NOT true. Using my intelligence, I concocted an ingenious plan. I packed all my stuff in my bag; my cloak, some food, and a poster of myself to remind me of the glory of escaping this life. Most importantly, I packed one of the knives I pinched from the men while they were eating dinner. I hide the bag inside the cannon so that I can grab it at my last performance. When the time comes, I am going to take out the knife and when I shoot out of the cannon and fly towards the silk circus tent roof, I was going to slash a nice big hole in it and then continue to fly out of here, and out into freedom. All I have to do now is wait until night when I go one stage...for the last time. Finally. It's here. My last performance. It takes a lot of effort not to show my plan on my face. Well, the humans didn't notice, but the animals did. 'What are you grinning about?' They asked. 'Grinning? I'm not grinning. This is just the face I have to put on when I go out into the stage.' I reply, the smile probably still on my face. This would be the last time I will be stuffed into a cannon, the last time I will be shot out with the scent of gunpowder, the last time I will be slam into the circus tent walls. It's bad for my face. Oh! It's my act they are announcing. I go out. I smile and wave. Then I am picked up by the neck and stuffed into the cannon. They take aim roughly at the spot where I cut out the hole. I take out my cloak and tie it around my neck and the knife and clutch it tightly in one wing. I am almost there. I can hear the fuse being lit. I imagine it making its way down. I sling the bag over my shoulders. Any second now. In three...two...one... BOOM! For once, the explosion sounds like music. I soar out from the cannon. I zoom upwards. I am about to collide with the tent and then... rip! I slash a hole in the tent roof and, as I calculated, continue to fly out. I drop the knife and spread out my wings, loving the feel of the air beating against them, and I can't help it. I scream. ' Freedoooooom!' I cry out. I can just imagine the circus getting smaller and smaller as I get further and further away from that life. While I was escaping the hell that I was living in, I flew over a farm. I looked down and noticed someone standing outside, looking at me. It was a chicken. The chicken was a ginger colour and I saw that she was wearing a green hat. She laughed up to me. I smiled my charming smile and waved. Then the next thing I know, I bump into something. I am spinning five 360s, before being flung out to be slingshot-ed by some power wires. I plummet back to the ground and slide through a tub of chicken feed. I hit my head hard and then flung into a somersault. Me being graceful, I landed on my feet, right in front of the ginger chicken. I spread my arms out like I do in the circus. 'Thank you ladies and gentlemen. You've been a wonderful audience.' Well, I wasn't suppose to say that now that I escaped the circus. I guess old habits are hard to get rid of. Then, I black out. Yep, just like that. I heard a \"bang\" and then my world went black. All I remember are the ginger chicken's sharp green eyes staring worriedly behind me. They were a really pretty green.[Chapter 3] O~K~. I originally wanted toleave it with chapter 2 and see if any one other than you, dear A. Kingsleigh, would start reading this, but I thought the last chapter was rather dull and to leave it with just that would've been a let down. So i decided to upload another chappie. I own nothing. I don't own the characters, and I don't own teh plot, just a few made up scenes which will come up later on in teh story *wink wink^^*. Enjoy. Rooster Run Chapter 3 Oh no... I am back at the circus. How? When? Did my escape fail? Or was my escape just a dream? Oh no...They are stuffing me into the cannon again. Not in the dark. No. Not in there. Gotta get out. There's a light forming in front of me. Good. I gotta get... I wake up in a dimly lit room, lying in a bunk. Where...? I sit up slightly, my head spinning. I turned and looked across the room. Only to not see the room. I see a flood of chickens staring at me. I gasp and bolt up, backing into the wall behind me. Was I captured and placed into a chicken circus? 'Who are you? Where am I? What's going-ow!' I cry out as a sharp pain goes though my left wing. I look at it to see that it was wrapped up in a bandage. 'What happened to my wing?' I ask, looking at them. One of them steps forward. I recognise her. She's the ginger chicken with the green eyes and hat. 'You took a rather nasty fall.' She said. Her voice was polite, but it had a determined edge to it. A white chicken with large glasses popped up behind her shoulder saying something, but her accent was strange and her speech was really fast. 'Was that English?' I ask 'She said you sprained you wing.' The ginger chicken answers. So that's what she said. 'But she fixed it.' Fixed it? 'I made the bandage.' Said the high voice of a cream-coloured chicken with blue hair. 'And I carried you in!' added the deep voice of a large red chick. The next thing that I hear are the other voices crying out together as the flood begins to move in on me. Sometimes being handsome is a curse. 'Woah woah woah!' I say, putting my hands out. 'Let's back up and start from the top. Where am I?' The ginger chicken speaks up again. 'You're right. I'm sorry. We're just very exci-This is a chicken farm.' 'And we're the chickens.' Adds the cream coloured chicken giving me a playful wink. All I could do was stare. '...Yeah. I'm with you so far. Chicken farm. Chickens.' I say, repeating the new-found information I just gained. Suddenly, an old rooster stuffed his face into mine, glaring at me. 'I don't like the look of this one.' He said. Wow. I feel loved. 'His eyes are too close together.' What's that got to do with it? 'And he's a yank.' He says, jabbing me at the scarf I wore with a rod he was holding, despite the ginger chicken's pleas to lay off. I gently push the rod away. 'Easy pops.' I say. 'Cock fighting is illegal where I come from.' 'And where is that exactly?' Asks the big red chicken. 'Oh, just a little place I call the land of the free.' Definitely. 'The home of the brave.' 'Scotland!' The glasses chicken says. Wow. One word I actually understand. 'No!' I say. 'America.' Although I don't remember my time there, I'm pretty sure that's where I came from. Everyone \"ohh-ed\" and \"ahh-ed\". The old rooster, however, seem to get even angrier. 'Poppycock!' He exclaimed. 'Pushy Americans. Always showing up late for every war.' War? He began to walk out of the door. 'Overpaid, oversexed, and over here.' he said before shutting the door behind him. 'Hey, what's eating grandpa?' I ask, feeling slightly offended. What did I ever do to him? I just got here. The ginger chicken looked at me apologetically. 'I'm sorry about him, mister-Mister?' She asks. Oh yeah, I love introductions. I stand up glad to find that my feet aren't broken and that the white chicken didn't \"fix\" them too. 'The name's Rocky.' I say, patting her on the shoulder. 'Rocky the Rhode Island Red, Rhodes for short.' 'Rocky Rhodes?' Asks a dark brown chicken, offering me a glass of water. Good, I need a drink. 'Catchy, ain't it?' I reply, taking the glass. And the name sounds good like me too. 'Um... Mister Rhodes? Is this you?' Asks the ginger chicken suddenly. She was holding something up at me. I took a glance and saw that it was a poster of me. I instantly felt wary. Why does she have that? Did she go through my stuff? 'Uh…who wants to know?' I ask evasively. 'A couple of desperate chickens.' She replies, and a crowd of chickens surround her, smiling at me. 'Because if it is you, you might just be the answer to all out prayers.' All suspicion melted away. Rocky Rhodes, the answer to a flock of chicken's prayers. I like the sound of that. I stare at the many chickens smiling at me. Oh, why not? It is me after all, so I'm not lying. 'Well then, call me a miracle dollface.' I say. 'Cause that's me.' Instantly, everyone goes into a small applause as they \"ohh\" and \"ahh\" at me again. 'And what brings you to England, Mr Rhodes?' A chicken asks. 'Why, all the beautiful English chicks, of course.' I say, smiling my charming smile at everyone. Some swoon. Oh yeah, I'm good. 'Give over!' Says the big red chicken as she smacks me on the back. I drop my cup, but oh well. Time to spice it up. 'You see I'm a traveller by nature.' I tell everyone, walking through the crowd. 'I did that whole barnyard thing, but I didn't really get into it.' I wink at a nearby chicken and she faints. 'Nope.' I put my hands up into the air. 'The open road, that's more my style.' Totally. 'Just give me a pack on my back, and point me where the wind blows.' I turn back to everyone. They all look excited. Time for the climax. 'In fact, you know what they call me back home? You're gonna love this. The Lone Free Ranger.' Yeah, I'm free now. And nothing will make me go back. The ginger chicken now stands in front of me saying something to everyone, but I can't hear her. Maybe I can settle here for a while. All this chickens fall easily for my charm, and I need a bit of pampering after what I've been through. Then the one word I hear the ginger chicken say makes me stop in my tracks. 'What?' I stammer. 'Did you say…fly?' This I was not expecting. 'You can teach us.' She says, spreading her hands out to everyone. Oh no. She wants me to teach everyone? Change of plan, time for me to hit the road. I mean, the circus could be after me right now. I can't stay here when they come this way. 'No I can't.' I answer and everyone slumps. 'Shh. You hear that?' I say, getting close to the ginger chicken's face. Everyone goes silent, trying to hear something only I can here; the explosion of the cannon. Nope, not going back. 'That's the open road calling me name and I was born to answer that call.' I grab my bag which was hanging from a hook near the door. Thankfully, it looked untouched. The chickens can keep my poster. 'Bye.' I zoom out of the room. Outside I look around. The chicken farm had a wire fence around it. I detected some tough looking black dogs in the shadows, but they were asleep. The farmer was also inside by the looks of the light in the window. Escape would be easy. I heard the door open and someone come out. 'Mr Rhodes?' I heard a familiar voice say. The ginger chicken again. I began to walk off and I could hear her following me. 'Um, perhaps I didn't explain our situation properly.' She was saying. 'We lay eggs day in and day out.' That was obvious. 'And when we can't lay any more, they kill us.' No. Really? I pity you. I turn around, walking backwards. 'Hey, it's a cruel world dollface.' I say, turning back around as I go round a corner. Very cruel. 'Might as well get used to it.' She cuts in front of me. 'Which part of \"they kill us\" do you not understand?' 'Hey.' I say putting my hand up. 'I've got my own set of problems to worry about. Besides, this bird cage can't be that hard to bust out.' I say, indicating the fence to prove my point. 'In fact, watch me.' I start walking away again, turning around another corner. 'It isn't so hard to get one chicken out, or even two.' She says. Then why are you still pestering me? 'But this is about all of us.' Ok! Stop. I turn around. Did I hear her correctly? 'All of you?' I repeat. She can't be serious. 'That's what I've been trying to tell you.' Oh, she is. 'Wait a minute, let me get this straight.' I say, walking towards her. 'You want to get every chicken in this place out of here AT THE SAME TIME?' 'Of course.' I look back to the hut I woke up in. It had a lot of chickens inside it. I then look to the other huts. You don't need to be a genius to know that all of these huts together equal A LOT of chickens. She must be crazy! 'You're certifiable! You can't pull off a stunt like that. That's suicide.' 'Where there is a will, there's a way.' That's her argument? Yep, she's crazy. I'm so not staying here now. 'Couldn't agree more.' I say, turning around again. 'And I WILL be leaving. That way.' I begin to walk to walk towards the fence, ignore her pleas. Just a few steps to freedom. Two lights emerge from around the corner. I heard the hum of an engine. I gasp as a cold feeling spreads through my body. They've found me! I turn and run back, past the ginger chicken and behind a nearby hut. I must have been out for a while. I didn't expect for them to find me this quickly. 'So that's it.' I hear the ginger chicken say. Oh no! 'You're from the circus.' I shush her and drag her behind the hut too. I can't be caught! 'Do you want to keep it down? I'm trying to lay low here.' I turn back to the circus master. He is knocking on the door of the farmers. Oh no! Now I'll have the circus master AND the farmers looking for me. As if this night can't get any worse. 'I should turn you in right now.' The ginger chicken says. 'You wouldn't.' I say confidently, then doubt wormed its way in. 'Would you?' 'Give me one reason why I shouldn't?' She replied, placing her wings on her hips. 'Because I'm…cute?' I offered, flashing a charming smile. She stares at me for a moment and I thought I got her. Then she started squawking for her life. What the hell? I quickly clamp my wing over her mouth. 'Hey hey hey! What kind of crazy chick are you? Do you know what would happen if he finds me?' 'It's a cruel world.' Was all she said when I took my wing back. I can't believe she turned my words against me. 'I just decided. I don't like you.' I say. 'I just decided. I don't care.' My surprise was small, but there. She doesn't care? That's a first for me. 'Now show us how to fly.' She's still on about that? 'With this wing?' I say, looking for an excuse. 'Teach us then!' 'No!' As soon as I say this, she starts squawking again. I quickly made shut her up with my wing. 'Now you listen here sister.' I say desperately, removing my wing again. 'I'm not going back to that life.' Please no. 'I'm a lone free ranger. Emphasis on free!' 'And that's what we want. Freedom!' I turned back to the circus master and I see him with the farmers. The farmers are carrying a torch. I gasp again. 'Fancy that. They're coming this way.' She says, seemingly teasing me. I panicked. 'Oh no! Oh no, they're onto me.' 'Teach us how to fly and we'll hide you.' The ginger says. 'And if I don't?' She takes a deep breath but I'm prepared for it this time. I clamp her beak just as a squawk went past. 'Was your father, by any chance, a vulture?' She brushes my wing away and offers hers. 'Do we have a deal?' I stare at her wing, glanced at the farmers, then back at her wing. How is it that this obviously smart and persuasive chick did not know the truth? I can't fly! But I could tell that if I tell her this, she'd turn me in no time flat. I figured it out now. If I wanted that freedom, I'd have no choice but to take the deal or it's back in the cannon I go. With a reluctant sigh, I offer her my wing, and she takes it and drags me somewhere. Oh god. What have I done to deserve this? And what have I gotten myself into?[Chapter 4] Hello you all you existant and non-existant readers! Some Random Gal has returned with another chapter of Rooster Run! A. Kingsleigh, I love you. So. Much! I just love getting your reviews and reading them^^ You make me feel so happy~ I understand your aggravation at how Chicken Run doesn't get many new fics, but when I thought about it more, I realised it's beause Chicken Run is so perfect it's hard to many a fic about it^^ Anyway~ enough babble! Time to move on and start reading!^^ I own nothing! Rooster Run Chapter 4 The ginger chicken drags me across the pen, narrowly missing the torch beam, and behind another hut. I peek out to see a tall, thin female farmer with the torch. She swings it around and nearly sees me. I duck back behind the hut. 'Time to make good of that deal, doll-' Her wing clamps my beak for a change. 'The name is Ginger.' I rub my beak. Her name is Ginger? Fitting. She knocks on the wall of the hut, and it opens! Two wings grab us and pull us in. I couldn't help but shout. Opps. Before the farmer could open the roof and find me, I was stuffed into a small box without a single word. It wasn't very comfortable. But I guess the farmers would never find me. I had to admit, the chicks knew what they were doing, but still… Suddenly, the lid opened. Ginger stood over me. 'Comfortable?' she asked sarcastically. 'Not really.' I replied. My back is starting to hurt. 'Maybe this will help.' She got out a kind of footrest and used it to scoop me out. 'Nice hide out.' I say sarcastically back, grabbing my wing as a stab of pain went through it. 'I had more room in my egg.' 'We held up our end of the deal, tomorrow, you hold up yours.' 'What deal?' 'The flying!' Ugh, don't remind me. 'Yeah yeah yeah. Right right right. Don't worry, I'll teach you everything I know.' I get out of the box and rub my wings together. 'Now, which bunk is mine?' Everyone started offering their bunks to me. I'll be looking forward to this. But then I felt Ginger yank my scarf back. 'Oh no, you don't. Come with me.' She dragged me out of the hut and over to another marked \"1\". 'Hey! Gentle. What's wrong with me sharing a bunk with them?' 'With what I know about you so far, I don't trust you with them.' 'So where am I sleeping then?' Ginger doesn't reply but knocks on the door. It opens and behind it…is Pops. 'Oh no.' I instantly say. Pops stares at us curiously, more glaring at me. Ginger starts talking to Pops about me bunking with him. I turn slowly and try to sneak into another hut, but Ginger catches me again by the scarf. 'You either bunk with Fowler, or sleep outside where the farmers could find you.' She says firmly. 'Unless you can suggest somewhere else to sleep.' You can't be serious. With Pops? It's almost as bad as the cannon. I stare at Ginger and decide to mess with her a little. 'How about your bunk?' She stares at me with a quizzical look, then shock and disbelief registered on her face. 'What?' Oh, this is funny. 'Well, you say you can't trust me with other chicks, but I'm sure you can trust me if I bunk with you, besides,' I lean in close and give her a playful wink. 'I would like to get to know you better.' Her beak dropped open and she starts making a weird sound. I wish I had a camera. A pretty blush covered her face that was so deep I could even see it on her ginger feathers and she grabs my good shoulder, thrusts me into Pop's hut, then closes the door without a backwards glance. I let out a snicker. That was fun. However, no matter how fun it was, I still ended up with Pops, him continuously saying how outrageous it was that I had to share with him, and he quickly dulled my mood. Eventually, however, he fell asleep. I snuck out of bed and went into my backpack. Everything looked untouched. How did they get the poster? I then saw it; a little piece of folded paper at the bottom of my bag. I take it and open it. It was the half that showed the cannon. The poster must've fell out of my backpack after I fell, but this piece ripped off. That was why everyone thought I could fly. It all makes sense now. I put the bottom part of the poster deep at the bottom of my bag. Oh well. It doesn't cause much trouble. I'll use them for protection and teach them what the circus taught me. Then, after they catch on and I have my fun, I'll just high-tail it out of here. I slip back into the bunk. No trouble at all.[Chapter 5] Hi again. i'm sorry i took so long. things are starting to pile up on me. I personally really like this chapter because it's the first i guess you can call it serious chapter in this story^^ I hope you, meaning you A. Kingsleigh, feel the impact I tried to make Rocky feel. For once Fowler is awesome!^^ I own nothing. And if I did i would make Rocky and Ginger dance the tango. Rooster Run 5 Early next morning, with the help of someone rapping loudly at the door, I woke to a large crowd of chicks outside the door. Ginger stood at the front, her wings crossed and her eyes staring at me expectantly. I rub my face in an effort to rub the sleep away. 'D'ya know what time it is?' I groan. What are they doing so early in the morning? 'Sunrise.' She replied seriously. 'We woke up early so that you could teach us how to fly.' Oh God. Blackmailing me into doing this was bad enough but this? I opened my beak to complain, but then I remembered that while I'm here, they, more specifically Ginger, had the power to turn me in. I groan again before waving my good wing offhandedly at them. 'Alright. I'm getting up, just give me a moment to wash up.' I close the door and go to a small basin of water that was at the back of the hut. I turn to the bed and notice that Pops was already up and somewhere. Damn him. I bet he knew that this would happen and deliberately let me sleep so that everyone would bug me. Ugh...but what bugs me more is that that old bird bet me in waking up early. I better get my act together. After I washed up, I addressed the crowd of chickens with a speech I made up while washing my face. 'So, you wanna fly? Well, it ain't gonna be easy. And it ain't gonna work overnight either.' Totally. 'You see, flying takes three things: hard work, perseverance and...' Opps. I forgot what the last one was... 'Hard work.' I finished. 'You said hard work twice.' I heard a voice say. Pops was back and he was standing just outside his hut. Oh yeah, time to get him back at him. 'That's because it takes twice as much work as perseverance.' I lick my finger and show it to the crowd in front of me. They laugh and it seems to tick Pops off. 'Codswallop!' He shouts. I don't know what they means, but if it means he's angry, than it's a good word. Grumbling, he goes into his hut and I turn back to the crowd. 'Now the most important thing is we have to work as a team.' Everyone nods. 'Which means...' What does it mean...oh well. 'You do everything I tell you.' Ginger seems a bit hesitant about nodding, but the rest does without complaint. Oh yeah, this is going to be a good few weeks here. I get up on the stand they prepared for me. 'Alright, let's rock and roll!' I begin with doing wing exercises. The circus made me do these so that when I am blasted out of the cannon, I was suppose to flap my wings like I was flying. For once, I'm thankful they made me do these. Everyone followed me without complaint. Although they followed me too well. When I winced from pain in my bad wing, they copied that as well. Kinda weird, but I'm not gonna complain. For the past week, I \"trained\" them to fly. \"Training\" them was hard work and I made them do things for me like bubble baths and messages every now and then. I need to get something out of this. 'Stop right there.' I said to the chicken giving me a message. 'Oh yeah, down. Yeah. Now make little circles. Faster, faster. Oh yes, perfect.' I love life. 'Oh that's the spot.' I sigh. Yeah, I could live like this: surround by chicks in a bubble bath, getting a cool breeze and a message by the most magical hands I have ever had work at my back. However, Ginger doesn't seem to see from my point of view and called all the chickens off. 'I thought you were going to teach us how to fly. ' 'That's what I'm doing.' I replied, but she scoffed. 'Isn't there usually some flapping involved?' she asked, waving her hands slightly. Well, there is. But it's just for show. 'Hey,' I say, crossing my legs. 'Do I tell you how to lay eggs? Relax! We're making progress.' 'Really? I can't help thinking we're going round in circles.' Oh no. Did she find out? Ginger waved her hands to the group I was training and I saw that they were all bent over and spinning around. I remembered what I told the chicken who was giving me a message. What did I tell you? They follow me too well. 'What the? Hey, cut it out! You're making me dizzy.' I turn to Ginger. 'I think they're ready to fly now.' This doesn't seem to quell Ginger, who stood staring, or glaring, at me with her wings on her hips. 'Good. Because they certainly can't walk anymore.' And they certainly can't. One glance behind her shoulder and I could see that they were all falling over and some at the back were being sick. Uh oh. Time to raise team morale. I stand up. 'Up and at 'em gals. Let's flap.' This seemed to get them excited for the rest of the afternoon. We tried all sorts of ways to try and make them at least airborne, although the results were fruitless and painful. I almost felt sorry for them and thought about telling them the truth, but then I remember the cannon and I keep quiet. Hey, I said almost. Halfway through the day, I noticed two rats laughing at our failed attempts. 'Who are those two jerks?' I ask Ginger. 'Oh, they're Nick and Fetcher, the farmyard rats. They used to help us get the things we need to escape for a price. I used to pay them with seeds but then they started asking for eggs and we can't part with those, otherwise we end up in the chop.' So, they'll get you anything for a price, eh? Nice info. I stored that little tibit away as I winced at a chick flying over my head and slamming into a wall. By the end of the day, everyone's spirit was lower than what it was this morning. Everyone was sore and tired. Not a good combination. 'Great work, ladies. Great work.' I say to chickens who staggered by me. 'The pain you're feeling is a good thing. It's good.' To make something good, make it seem good. 'Pain is your friend, ok? It's a positive thing. Just keep the faith there…what was your name?' So many chicks to remember. 'Agnes.' I say, remembering. 'Agnes. You'll get there.' I noticed a chick staggering behind me. I remember her name. 'Ducky, I think you flew four feet today.' I say, taking her hand. She smiles and it was an improvement until the rats ruined it. 'That's right four feet!' I heard them say. 'From the roof to the ground.' And they both burst out laughing. I could feel the irritation gnawing at me. 'Nothing to worry ladies. Great work.' I say in my best enthusiastic voice that I could muster, then under my breath. 'You cheese-eating little-' Before I could finish my insult, I felt a slight tremor. 'Whoa…' I say as I eye a water well, which had ripples on the surface. 'That doesn't sound good.' I laugh nervously. 'Ok, the ground's shaking. Are we worried?' I put my arm out to stop a passing chicken which I found out to be Ginger. A growling noise shattered the air and two headlights light up the growing darkness. The familiar cold feeling courses through my body as I gasp. I turn and grasp Ginger's shoulders. 'The circus! Quick, hide me. Hide me!' Ginger rolls her and scoffs as if she was annoyed, but grabs my wings. 'Come on.' She says and drags me over back to Pops' hut. We raced past Pops who was staring at himself in the mirror (I didn't know he was so vain). Ignoring Pops' demands on us getting out, Ginger stuffed me into his closet. 'Oh, give it a rest Pops.' I groan as the door slams shut. I hear Ginger's footsteps fade away as I stare at some random poster of some chick just visible in front of me in the darkness. A few minutes later, the door swings open, Pops glaring at me. I put my hands up. 'Alright. Alright. I'm out.' I step out of the closet and smooth my tail feathers. When I turn back around, Pops is still glaring at me. 'You can't fly can you?' He says. I instantly feel defensive. 'Hey, I so can.' I snap back. 'Then why don't you?' 'Um, hello?' I show my bandaged wing. Pops merely raises an eyebrow and pokes at it with his stick. I noticed that it wasn't as sore as it was before. I reacted half a second late. 'Hey! Watch it! Still sore.' I take a step back and give him my own glare. He doesn't flinch. 'Back in my day, I never saw a rooster fly. And I'm sure that's because they can't.' I open my beak to deny it and say that I can, but he ploughs on. 'You may think that you being in a farm full of chickens is a dream come true, but for them it's not. They are depending on you. They put their life in your hands and I mean that. They believe you can fly and they are counting on you to help them escape from their life here. To you this seems to be nothing but a game, but to them, this is a matter of life and death. If they don't get out of here, they are dead. Eventually every single one of them will die. So stop ruffling their feathers, getting their hopes up, make them waste their time on this nonsense and leave.' Now that shook me a little. Just a little. I was so hooked into leisure and checking out the chicks that I nearly forgot why I was doing the exercise in the first place. I remembered what Ginger told on my first night here. We lay eggs, day in and day out. And when we can't lay anymore…they kill us. How did I reply again? Hey, it's a cruel world dollface. Might as well get used to it. That's right. It is a cruel world. And as the saying goes: survival of the fittest. I swallowed the lump that suddenly formed in my throat and looked at Pops square in the eyes. 'I am taking all this very seriously.' His face clearly shows doubt, but I can't mess up my lie here. 'I am not ruffling their feathers or wasting their time. Maybe you are the one wasting time not joining us. So don't come crying to me when you are approaching your final moments.' With that, I stepped out of the hut. I heard some chatter coming from the hut next door. Good. I need some fun to brush off this shaky feeling. As I walk away, I could hear Pops mumbling to himself. 'Americans. Always thinking they're the best of the best when they are just a waste of time and air.' Oh, I'm gonna get you back for that Pops.[Chapter 6] Hi! Some Random gal is back! Sorry for taking so long with this^^'' Life has been busy and the stupid computer went retarded. This is the last chapter I had prewritten now. So Updates will now be even more slow than usual, partly because of my now busy life and also because I'm trying to add this impact for Rocky's character growth and I'm not happy with what I've done so i've been re writing over and over and it's slowly getting to what i want it to be. By the way, I need some help. You know the part where they start over-feeding the chickens, and that whole time Rocky was hiding in a watercan. I have no diea what to make him do or think durng that time. A. Kingsleigh, please hlpe meT^T. Aso, I have to let you know thatt h hols are drawing closer and i won't be able to post anything during the holidays. I hope you don't mind waiting 2 weeks until I come back^^'' Do not own anything here. if I did I'd make Rocky my house pet. Rooster Run 6 'And the pig says to the horse, \"Hey fella! Why the long face?\"' Everyone bursts out laughing at my joke. The feeling I had with Pops was gone. I took a swig out of the funnel cup I was given. 'Oh wait.' I tell everyone. I pull out one of my tail feathers and stuff it into the cup. 'Cocktail!' Every laughs again as I take another swig from the cup. 'Give over!' I hear the big red bird, whose name I now know is Bunty, say as she gives me a hard slap on the back. This causes me to spray my drink all over the crowd. I wiped my mouth, looked up, then gasped when I saw that the chick who took the brunt of my spray attack was Ginger. All the other chickens quickly went quiet. Ok, this was awkward. 'So…uh, anyway.' I stammered. Oblivious Babs took out a handkerchief and wiped away the spray from Ginger's face. When Ginger turned to look at her, Babs merely giggled. I really marvel her sometimes. 'Remember those flying tips tomorrow. They're very important.' I continued. 'And keep thinking those flighty thoughts.' The crowd disbanded and Ginger came towards me. When someone is angry at you, butter them up. 'They are swell chicks. They really are.' I say, standing up. 'Hey, look at what Babs made me.' I picked the woollen, blue and purple, beanie-like thing. 'A beak warmer.' I said, putting it on. 'Isn't that the cutest?' Ginger merely blinked as I took the beak warmer off. 'And that Bunty.' I added. 'She really packs a punch.' Ginger's didn't change, so I gave up and took the plunge. 'Is there a problem?' 'Have we flown over that fence?' 'Not quite.' I said, beginning to walk over to the door. I already had Pops doubting me about the flying thing, I don't need her too. 'Then there's a problem.' Ginger replied. 'Hey,' I called back taking the towel a chick was offering me. 'Good things come to people who wait dollface.' 'Ginger!' I heard her call as the door closed. I go round the hut and approach a basin of water with a mirror over it. I splash my face and check my hair. I saw Ginger come up behind me in the reflection. 'Ok, how long did it take you?' She asked. 'To do what?' 'To learn how to fly?' Well, 30 seconds to the max, 35 if you include flying out and getting a faceful of circus tent. 'Apples and oranges, babydoll.' I replied, turning to her. 'I'm gifted. They're not. You can't compare the two, ok?' I turn back to the mirror. 'The point is, these things take time.' I heard her make a noise of impatience and she went to my side. 'Which we are rapidly running out of,' she replied. 'And we haven't even lifted off the ground. Why?' 'Trust!' I heard someone with a familiar accent cry out behind me. Ginger and I turn around to see the white chicken, Mac I think, flourishing her notebook and babbling something incorrigible. But I think I got the first word. Trust. Now that is definitely a wrong fact. Trust never got anyone nowhere. I remember once I trusted a lion cub during my time in the circus. Hey, it was small, fluffy and seemingly defenceless so I tried to take him under my wing, no pun intended. I looked out for him and I thought he was looking out for me. But it turned out he was merely standing by me learning all my moves so that he can apply them to his act and leave me with the crickets. 'Sorry Rocky.' I remember him say when they took him onto the stage to face a crowd of screaming and cheering spectators. 'But in a life of showbiz, the only ones you can count on are me, myself and I.' Even if I was mad at him for a while, I found that real good advice. You can only count on yourself in this big world, showbiz or not. Others slow you down. I mean, look at Ginger and the other chickens. They could all bust out of here if they wanted. But they believe they have to bust out at the same time and look how they ended up. They are still stuck in this farm and slowly approaching their deaths at what they call the chop. 'I swear she ain't using real words.' I say after she finishes her rant. Ginger makes an impatient sound. 'She said we need more thrust.' She says. 'Oh, thrust.' Was all I could say. I wonder how she understands what this chick says. Oh well, sail with it. 'Well, of course you need thrust. Thrust and flying are like...' I cross my fingers. 'Like this.' I point to each finger. 'There's flying and there's thrust.' 'Would you excuse us?' Ginger asks Mac. Then she grabs my bandaged wing and drags me around the building(oh right, my wing is suppose to hurt). 'Hey hey hey, the wing. The wing.' I complain, holding my wing protectively. Then she corners me and starts poking my chest. 'If we don't see some results by tomorrow, the deal is off and you're on your own.' She stops poking me. 'No more hiding, the farmers will find you and it's back to the circus, flyboy.' 'You know, you're the first chick I ever meet with her shell still on?' I couldn't help but say. She purses her beak. She really needs to get a sense of humour. I take my towel off my shoulders and put it on hers. 'Sleep tight angel face. The Rock's on the case.' I click my tongue flirtatiously and begin to turn around the corner. 'Ginger!' I hear her say and she flings the towel at me and hits my face. I let out a sigh. She's really gotta unruffled her feathers. Still, that threat of hers unnerved me. If there is one thing I learned in my time here, it's that Ginger is serious about everything she says. I sit in a dark corner where the dogs and the chicks won't find me and begin to think. I've gotta make a show tomorrow that will convince her that we are making even the tiniest of progress. But the problem was how. I couldn't just go and bring a cannon in here. What am I going to do? Suddenly, I hear a rustling noise. I stare out and I see the two rats scampering around the edge of the farm, collecting whatever they collect. Staring at them, I figured their rule is whatever isn't tied down, take it. I watched as they skilfully sneak around the dogs, asleep or awake. That's when it hit me! I run around the edge of the fence until I found this little hole. I remember asking about it and the flock told me it was a result of another failed escape. It hadn't been filled up yet. I crawled through it and hid in the shadows, close to the rats. 'Psst!' I called, trying not to wake a dog that was also close to me. The rats didn't stop what they were doing, so I tried again. This time, the tall skinny rat in the green suit stopped. 'Hey Nick, did you hear something?' He asked, looking around 'Nope.' Said the chubbier one with the yellow suit and zip tie whom I now know is Nick, barely glancing up. I tried again, a little more louder. The dog nearby stirred, but didn't wake. 'Now I know someone is calling us, Nick.' The tall skinny rat, Fetcher says, gently dumping his load and walking towards my corner. Nick sighs and follows. They turn around the corner, spot me, look momentarily surprised, then they smile. 'Well,' says Nick in a tone I don't like. 'If it isn't the infamous flying rooster.' I'm gonna let that one slide. Fetcher laughs. 'The popular teacher that is teaching the chickens to fly.' Fetcher says. The two rats look at each other and then say, 'DOWNWARDS!' Then they burst out in a fit of giggles. I'll let that one go too. I mean, I have no right to say anything, I guess. I wait for them to finish laughing, then I clear my throat and begin to talk. 'I heard from Ginger that you have a talent in supplying...supplies.' I state. 'You heard right.' Nick says. 'But we don't do stuff for free.' Nick turns to Fetcher and gives him a look. Fetcher digs into a metal suitcase he was carrying and took out an egg cup. Yep, they only work for eggs. 'Alright, how about I cut you a deal?' I say. 'We're listening.' The two rats say, leaning in eagerly. I had a theory. These two rats seem like they never left this farm. Meaning that all they ever saw was chickens. This was the first time they saw a rooster. Meaning... 'If you work for me for a while, then I'll...' I lean in and whisper. 'I'll give you every egg that I lay this month.' They reel back in shock. If I'm correct, they won't know that roosters don't lay eggs. And from the grins that are forming on their faces, I was pleased to see that I was right.[Chapter 7] Hey! I. Have. Returned! I'm so sorry for taking so long. Honestly, I almost gave up on this when I lost motivation, but then I had this beautiful Chicken Run dream that made my inspiration shoot to the roof! For some reason, Ginger was caught in a wooden cage for something, and Rocky snuck over to help her. Ginger tried to act all tough and leader-ly and they both ended up in a small argument. But then they fell silent and Ginger said,' …I'm sorry. It's just…I'm scared. I'm really scared Rocky.' And then Rocky stuck his wing through the wooden bars and held her fingers. It was such a sweet dream! I still remember how warm Rocky's fingers were~. I might fanfiction-nate that^^. Anyway, thanks to that dream, this chapter is up. And thank you A. Kingsleigh for helping me find an idea for the next chapter. And thank you that other author(s) who faved this story and commented. Much love to both of you. Onto it then! Sorry for the ending. I failed near the end. Rooster Run 7 I got up at the same time as Pops today. I gave him the \"oh-no-not-this-time\" look. He merely scowled and went out to do his round of crowing. When he does, I thought he sounded a bit off and low. But it's easy for me to say that when I've never crowed before. I never learned. As I had hoped, the rats were standing by the hole we agreed to meet at, a bag lying next to them. The rats turned and gave a smile. 'Buon giorno, signore.' Said Nick. 'That's Italian.' Fetcher added. Then they began to ramble off about their daring quest to get what I asked them last night. I said encouraging words that prompt them into a good mood, being the smooth guy that I am. 'We slipped into the farmer's room, all quiet-like.' Started Nick. 'Like a fish.' Added Fetcher. This seemed to throw Nick off his groove, as he shook his head at his partner and gave him the usual \"are-you-an-idiot?\" look. Nick decided to not tell me the rest and handed me the bag. 'Anyway, guv, here it is. El merchandiso.' 'That's Spanish.' I gotta admire their range of languages a little. I peeked into the bag to make sure they got everything. They did. For totally irritating, untrustworthy farm rats, they sure get their job done well. I look up to say thank you when a voice cuts the air and even causes the rats to flinch. 'What are these two crooks doing here?' Ginger was walking up the path and looking at the rats darkly. 'So! You know each other.' I said, feigning ignorance to prevent anything ugly coming up. 'She don't think we're valuable.' Fetcher said, crossing his arms. I walked over to Ginger's side. 'Guys, you are without a doubt the sneakiest, most light-fingered thieving parasites I've ever met.' I said. This seems to put them in a good mood again, as they \"modestly\" shook my \"compliment\" off. 'So, uh, how about them eggs?' Nick then asks. Ginger gasps loudly and then glares at me accusingly. 'Eggs? Don't tell me you promised them-' 'Yep!' I cut in before she could ruin my lie. 'I promised them every egg I lay this month.' I wink at her. She gets the picture but instead of looking relieved that I wasn't really going to give any eggs, she now looks like she disbelieved. 'And, uh, when can we expect the first instalment?' Nick asks eagerly. I make a show of rubbing my stomach. 'I'm brewing one up as we speak. I'll keep you posted.' The two rats share a glance and then step backwards. 'Pleasure doing business with you, sir. Sucker.' I heard them mumble the last part and I mentally smirk. If only they knew who the real suckers were. I felt a disapproving stare poking at the side of my head. I turn to see Ginger shaking her head at me. 'What?' I ask, lifting my wing up. 'You lied to them.' She said softly. 'I didn't lie, dollface.' I answered back. 'I just…' What was that word again? '…omitted certain truths.' Which was true. If I had told them that I could lay eggs, then that would be lying. They just assumed I could lay eggs. 'I'll give them exactly what I promised.' 'Which is nothing?' 'Which is what I'll give them.' Which was technically the same thing, but this puts me in a good light. Some-what. 'And what will you give us?' I pull a belt from out of the bag and stretch it in front of her. 'Thrust.' I let go of the belt, making a loud snapping noise. Ginger blinked. 'Go wake the others while I set up.' I turn back and take out the two nails the rats had also got. I still felt a presence behind me. I turn to see Ginger still staring at me. 'What? Aren't you going to get the others?' 'Look Mr Rhodes. I appreciate you trying to help us, but I'd rather you'd help us through honest methods instead of lying.' Ugh, is she ever gonna let this drop? 'Look dollface,' I begin, straightening up. 'My \"lying\",' I said, making a motion with my fingers as I said the word. 'Whatever it is you prefer to call it, is gonna help you bust out of this place. You should be grateful I did it. So why are your feathers so ruffled?' 'So you make people feel grateful to you and like you through lying?' I blinked. 'People like me when I am honest too!' I retorted a second late, but for some reason the words sound lame to my ears. Now that I thought about it, I could not really recall anyone back in my circus days being my friend. Sure, we had the occasional animal that we could talk to when things were stressed but we were more accomplices to each other rather than friends. Buddies of survival. Even between what I can only describe as \"trusted buddies\" we were always stabbing each other in the back, using each other as stepping stones to become the best act in the circus. I realise that even now I am using these chickens' situation for my own agendas. I again felt that weird uncomfortable feeling in my throat, like a lump was stuck there, along with a heavy feeling in my stomach. I realise a second later after I felt it that the feeling was guilt. I had found myself looking down at the ground almost shamefully. I looked back up to see Ginger giving me a look that came to close to pity. I didn't like it. I didn't want her looking at me like that. 'Well, I guess what's done is done.' She said in a resigned disappointed voice that did nothing to help my guilt. 'Fine. I'll go and wake the others.' She turned and walked off without a backwards glance, knocking on doors and peeking in to wake everyone. Rocky followed her with his gaze for a bit, watching her face she called the chickens to wake up, stopping a bit to talk to Mac. They began to discuss things, peering into her notebooks. The look of absolute trust and faith on their faces gave me this funny ache in my chest so I had to turn away, staring at the nail I held in my wings. But this strange feeling wasn't like the one I had with Pops. This one made him feel more sad and…envious. Yes, I was envious of them. I clearly could see how those two were the best of friend, while being honest and open with each other. I've never seen anything like that before. Animals in the circus always had to lie and act, using sugar coated deadly words to manipulate others. Honesty never existed on stage. I look up again to see two sleepy looking chicks smile at me. I smile back but then this accusatory voice at the back of my head scolded at me. Liar , and it made me turn away. I packed up the bag and stood up and walked away under the pretence of going to set up. I didn't want them to look at me like that when they didn't know the truth. I growled at myself as I hammered the nails into the ground a little harder than necessary. 'Now, you decide to grow a conscience, Rocky?' I said to myself.[Chapter 8] Ok! Half way to the story we finally are! I started to watch Chicken Run again. I love the special feature on the making of Chicken Run. It almost makes me want to do Claymation. ^^ We are almost to the dance part? Everyone looking forward to it? It's my favourite part in the whole thing. That, and it's the time when the GingerXRocky began to form^^. Anyway! Enough of pointless rambling. Go ahead and read. P.S: Thank you Catfreaklol for your review. I saw you wrote a Chicken Run story because you were inspired^^ I feel very warmed that it was me that inspired you! I hope you do well in your story! I'd review but the computer won't open the review box=3= Warning of mentions of animal abuse. Rooster Run 8 I made what I could best call a giant slingshot. I nailed two nails into the ground and attached the stretchy belt to it. I then nailed another nail behind it where I attached a rope to it, connecting it to a cart. I felt rather proud of my work when I finished. This was the most work I've done since cleaning all the soot and ash off my feathers. Bunty had kindly offered to be the first one to try out what I called a \"thrust exercise\". Ginger stood next to me giving me expectant glares which made me realise this could be my last chance. It didn't help my case either that those stupid rats were back again, setting up an egg carton stand on the side, laughing as the cart was pulled back. \"The tension's killing me!\" Fletcher called out. \"It's gonna kill her!\" Nick added and they both fell into fits of laughter. They were like this all throughout the day after they gave me their stuff. It even eventually made Bunty nervous. So I gave her the helmet as a precaution. \"Release!\" I yelled and Bunty shot past us in a blur. She zoomed past the rats and began to flap her wings as the witnessing chickens, Ginger included, began to cheer her on. For a moment, I stared at it all and I was suddenly reminded on my circus, the way the crowds would cheer whenever I was shot out of the cannon. Yet somehow, as I watched them cheer louder and even wave their wings around a bit when the cart reached the ropes limit and flung Bunty across the farm, there was something different about them compared to my audience. At first I couldn't put my finger, or feather in my case, on it. Suddenly, there was a loud grunt from the other side of the farm which prompted a groan from the chicken audience. I snapped my head around and realised I made a miscalculation in my little sling shot device. Bunty was flung across the farm in the illusion she was actually flying, just like my cannon. However, Bunty couldn't turn while in the air, so she shot straight across the farm, and smacked into the fence. She rebounded and flew into the air, losing her helmet. The rats jeered and laughed and I would've loved to go over and smack them myself, just as Bunty landed bullseye on top of them. Their laughing quickly turned into terrified screaming as there was collision with a satisfying thud, though of course, not for Bunty's sake. The egg carton stand they were sitting on rolled across the farm from the impact towards us and the crowd. Don't worry, we promptly side stepped which, unfortunately for them, meant they crashed into the chicken sheds behind us. Ginger turned to me to gaze at me with an unamused look, and we both cringed as the group crashed into another shed. I knew that look. It didn't mean good news. I gulped. \"Opps.\" I said lightly with a chuckle, trying to lighten the mood. Before I could mention that at least the rats finally got what they deserved, a sudden shrill noise pierced the air. A bell. I have to say the reaction was very remarkable. Every chicken, including stiff-feathered Ginger, tensed. Suddenly they are started shrieking and running around. Babs came over to Ginger and started fretting about something, but I didn't care enough at the time to listen. I just stared at all the chickens as they began to assemble into a row like soldiers, looking anxiously and fearfully at the gate fence. Seeing how much they changed from the cheering crowd to a terrified flock, I realised just how serious this was. \"Hide me.\" I whispered to Ginger. However, she either didn't hear me over the desperate squawking or ignored me. She looked worriedly at Babs who was clutching her knitting needles so tightly they rattled and she even dropped a few stitches. Babs never dropped stitches. She goes ballistic when she drops stitches and right now Babs was still trembling for her own dear life. This is definitely not good news, as I glance at the farmers coming out of their house. \"Hide me!\" I say more desperately. Ginger, however, turned sharply at me and gave me an impatient glare. \"Hide yourself!\" She snapped before scurrying off to go in line. I stared after her before shrugging it off. Fine, I was going to bolt anyway. I took a quick scan of the farm and spotted a large metal watering leaning against a hut. Disregarding that it could possibly mess up my beautiful tail, I scampered over and jumped inside, tucking up into a ball again. It stank and the metal was slightly rusted, and it was nowhere near comfortable as I already was starting to feel cramps. Suddenly, as I sat squatted in the watering can, I suddenly felt something. It came intense and burning hot before I could stop it. I felt angry. What the hell was I doing here? I escaped the circus looking for freedom, to finally live a life for myself, to do things for myself, and no longer for the benefit and satisfaction of others. How many years have I been stuffed and shot out of a cannon to satisfy strangers so they could pay my stupid masters? Don't I deserve a little slack? Maybe even retirement, I did my part. I'm done satisfying an audience, people. Now I'm here after escaping trying to satisfy these stupid chicks that don't even know that chickens can't fly! I thought of them all cheering before and I felt disgusted. How dare they force me to stay here after all I've been through! I don't owe them anything! They were no different than every audience that cheered at my misery! \" STOP IT! \" I suddenly heard a shriek which sounded distinctly like Ginger. I blinked and paused listening for what happened next. Aside from further faint murmuring which sounded like Ginger talking to them, there was no other noise. Odd. The whole flock is outside. What's going on? I peeked up over the rim of the can. The farmers were inside now and the whole flock was over an overturned trough of feed. Ok, they were getting fed. So? Why were the flock staring, fixated, at Ginger who was standing on the trough looking like she was trying to convince them not to eat? Can they not eat now? Well, the last two sentences I heard her say pretty much summed it up. \"Don't you see what's happening?\" She said, addressing her audience. \"They're fattening us up.\" She turned, her dark green eyes sweeping every chicken with an intense, near ominous look. \"They're going to kill us all!\" Whoa, she had as much tact as an executioner wielding an axe, as all the chicks, if possible, paled and gulped down their current mouthful of feed heavily. I climbed out of the watering can and approached the flock with my wings up in a comforting gesture. \"Whoa! Heavy alert!\" I laughed, trying to lighten the mood as all the chicks turned to stare at me. I tried my best to ignore to ignore their haunted stares. I had enough of that from the old timers in the circus. I grabbed Ginger and pulled her off the trough. \"She didn't mean it, girls.\" I called back over my shoulder. I gave a hasty grin to the chicken closest to me. \"Keep eating. Save some for me.\" I ignored Gingers protests and slaps, which are actually quite painful. She is one tough chick. I finally steered her around the corner and into an empty hut where she promptly breaks out of my grip. \"Let go of me!\" She snaps. Normally I'd pull a cool wisecrack here, but I was still slightly angry from inside the watering can. \"Listen!\" I snapped back, exasperated with her behaviour. \"I've seen some hard-boiled eggs in my day but I'd say you're about… twenty minutes!\" \"And what's that supposed to mean?\" She replied coolly. My exasperation flared more. \"It means you gotta lighten up!\" I replied. Yeah Ginger. Heard of it? \"You see,\" I started, pacing around her. \"Over in America, we have this rule. If you want to motivate someone,\" I turn to her sharply, hoping to maybe make her understand. \"Don't. Mention. Death!\" However, Ginger merely scoffed at the idea. \"Funny.\" She said, as she suddenly fixed an accusatory glare at me. \"Over here, the rule is 'Always tell the truth'.\" I instantly knew what she was referring to, but I didn't quite see how it would help her argument. I gave a small white lie and it got me what I wanted to attempt to help her. She told the truth and most of the chicks look paralysed with dread, like a panther that just realised the jumping ring was on fire at the last minute. \"Oh yeah, that's been working like a real charm, hasn't it?\" I replied back with the same accusatory tone. I decided to give her a bit of charity, since she's been so 'kindly' helping my own situation. \"Let me give you some advice.\" I said, taking a step toward her so we were only a small distance apart. \"You want them to perform? Tell them what you want to hear.\" Like they told all us animals every single show. You'll be fine. You're in good hands. Even when we saw the dangers and knew what was coming, we'd follow like strays. In a way, that's what we were. However, Ginger didn't take to my imparted wisdom as she merely gave me a scalding scowl. \"You mean lie!\" She spat, looking like she wanted to peck my eyes out, before storming out of the hut. I gave an exasperated, irritated sigh as I begrudgingly followed her. Here we go again . \"You know what the problem is?\" I called to her as she began to walk away. \"You're-\" I searched for the perfect word to describe her, but, much to my subconscious disapproval, I couldn't do anything but mimic what my ringmaster said. \"Difficult!\" \" You don't need to tell them what's really happening.\" The ringmaster said to the other workers. \"They are just dumb animals, no need to make them or the job any more difficult.\" \"Why because I'm honest?\" She retorted. I cringed as the stab hit close to home. She let out a grunt as she presses her fingers briefly to her temple, as if staving off a headache caused by me. Tch, should be the other way round. \"I care about what happens to them! Something I don't expect a LONE FREE RANGER to know anything about!\" The whip lashed again and again close to the feet of a newcomer dog that joined the circus. The dog whined, terrified, and backed again with its tail between its legs, but the ringmaster was relentless as he tried to urge it to jump through the hoop. One lash made contract with its paw and it yelped loudly, but the man showed no sympathy, shouting profanities at the poor creature. I spared the dog but a brief glance. But he huffed and turned back to his miniscule dinner. Stupid animal, Rocky thought. He should know better than to not listen. I forced down the burning shame that rose in my throat. I paused for the split second, trying to find anything to counter with, to defend myself, but I found that I had none. So, feeling cornered, all I could do was lash. \"Well, if that's the way you show it, I hope you never care about me!\" I shouted. Ginger wasted no time shouting back with such assurance I almost felt hurt. \"I can assure you, I never will!\" Well! \"Good!\" \"Fine!\" I spun on my heels and stormed off, but the anger wasn't as strong, no matter how much I wanted to hold onto it. I want to stay angry. I don't want to stay here. I want to stay angry as so when I leave, I'll feel glad about it. I want to get away from the selfish audience of chickens, who only knew how to be happy when benefiting from someone else's efforts, with Ginger as their ring leader. I clung to that belief, I clung tightly as I approached the edge of the hut and went to turn the corner. I saw, and I gasped. The group of chickens have depleted immensely, so many had retreated to their huts, the shut doors giving off a really sad vibe. Some lingered in their doorways, leaning against the frames, unable to drag themselves inside, as if their nests weren't their refuge anymore. If I had to describe 'at death's door', this is probably what I'm looking at. The Scottish chicken, Mac, leaned against a pole and was playing on a harmonica she had pulled out, most likely some Scottish sound that sounded sad and woeful. Even steel-feathered Bunty sat on the overturned trough, gazing at the chicken feed in her wing before letting it slip off her palm, the haunted eyes that everyone else had gazing at the grains join the large pile without a spark of care, clearly not hungry anymore. Then there was Babs, sweet cheerful Babs, who was usually oblivious to the world. She was also sitting on the pile, knitting as she always is. But her needles didn't move with their usual fervour, the clicking almost sounding like a ticking clock. She stopped as she finished her stitch and held up her new creation, and she slumped as she viewed her knitted noose. The needles slipped out of her wing and clattered near inaudible on the pile of chicken feed. It hurt to watch. It was even more painful than a booing audience. It was then that I realised why they were so different. They were not an audience. In fact, I now see they were far from it. They were a flock, a flock of chickens searching for hope. I wasn't a source of entertainment. I was the source of their hope. They were cheering because they thought they could finally achieve a better life, a life without counting down the days. Without forced labour, a life where they could finally take control of their own lives, and not by someone who takes care of them for their own benefit. I finally see how, that they wanted freedom, the same way I wanted it. They weren't the selfish ones, I was. Ginger, for once I was willing to admit, was right. I never cared. I sighed heavily, the shame rising again in my throat, but I pushed it down. There was no more time for shame anymore. I gripped the corner of the hut, glancing again at the woeful flock and nodded my head in resolve before turning away. Just because Ginger was right, doesn't mean I can't make her wrong. As I approached the rats, I suddenly felt like that was my resolve. I would prove her wrong. That I could be more than a Lone Free Ranger. For once, I had enough of haunted eyes, and enough of myself. I was going to change, and make Ginger say she was wrong. …I once saw a monkey circus in a foreign place. The monkeys did amazing things; they rode tricycles, balanced on balls and I think I vaguely remember them making a pyramid. But amongst all that, I remember clearly the ring master, constantly whipping with his whip for them to go faster, and dragging them around with a cane like they were objects. As amazing as the tricks they did, I couldn't enjoy it as well as I could. So I walked away, only feeling regret that I couldn't do anything for them. I'm sorry if the scene of animal abuse was disturbing to some people. I definitely know it was disturbing to me. Always say no to it and never support it. No life should ever have to life like that. …But I still hate insects and will kill them on sight. Sorry. I'm also so sorry for taking so long! I promise I'll strive to get better. But I hope to get faster as this scene was actually the hardest to type as barely anything goes on that allows me to add some character development and I didn't want to just describe what happened in the scene when you can just go off and watcht eh movie yourselves. I hope this chapter was as deep as the other chapters before it. I look forward to typing the dance scene. PS: Thank you all who reviewed and that one person who personally messaged me. You all are loved!^^","LastChapter":"Ok! Half way to the story we finally are! I started to watch Chicken Run again. I love the special feature on the making of Chicken Run. It almost makes me want to do Claymation. ^^ We are almost to the dance part? Everyone looking forward to it? It's my favourite part in the whole thing. That, and it's the time when the GingerXRocky began to form^^. Anyway! Enough of pointless rambling. Go ahead and read. P.S: Thank you Catfreaklol for your review. I saw you wrote a Chicken Run story because you were inspired^^ I feel very warmed that it was me that inspired you! I hope you do well in your story! I'd review but the computer won't open the review box=3= Warning of mentions of animal abuse. Rooster Run 8 I made what I could best call a giant slingshot. I nailed two nails into the ground and attached the stretchy belt to it. I then nailed another nail behind it where I attached a rope to it, connecting it to a cart. I felt rather proud of my work when I finished. This was the most work I've done since cleaning all the soot and ash off my feathers. Bunty had kindly offered to be the first one to try out what I called a \"thrust exercise\". Ginger stood next to me giving me expectant glares which made me realise this could be my last chance. It didn't help my case either that those stupid rats were back again, setting up an egg carton stand on the side, laughing as the cart was pulled back. \"The tension's killing me!\" Fletcher called out. \"It's gonna kill her!\" Nick added and they both fell into fits of laughter. They were like this all throughout the day after they gave me their stuff. It even eventually made Bunty nervous. So I gave her the helmet as a precaution. \"Release!\" I yelled and Bunty shot past us in a blur. She zoomed past the rats and began to flap her wings as the witnessing chickens, Ginger included, began to cheer her on. For a moment, I stared at it all and I was suddenly reminded on my circus, the way the crowds would cheer whenever I was shot out of the cannon. Yet somehow, as I watched them cheer louder and even wave their wings around a bit when the cart reached the ropes limit and flung Bunty across the farm, there was something different about them compared to my audience.

Once he'd taken anmoment to breathe, he made a valiant attempt to pick up every singlenbit of wood he'd just cut. \"That boy!\"nMercedes set down the tortillas she was making and sighed. Whyncouldn't he get suddenly get tired when he was asked to do choresnlike other twelve-year-olds? Even Pedro never bothered getting morenwood than he had to. Not a moment later,nMateo was nudging the door open with his shoulders and backing intonthe room. The pile he was carrying covered his body from the waistnup, and threatened to fall at any second. \"I got it,nMercedes!\" she could hear how proud of himself he was, even fromnbehind a three-foot wall of timber and couldn't help smiling. He'dnbeen eager to be allowed to use the axe for years, and once she'dnfinally let him, he jumped at every chance. \"Where will you putnit?\" she asked with a hint of amusement in her voice. \"I onlynneeded a little, but I see you've brought in enough to build anwhole new house.\" There was a pause, and what she could see of hisnlegs shifted slightly. \"I didn't reallynthink that far ahead,\" he answered sheepishly. Mercedes took a fewnsteps back as he mused, \"Maybe I could—ahhh!\" The whole pile tumblednfrom his outstretched arms, and he had to hop around them as fast asnhe could to avoid getting himself crushed. A few rolled offnhaphazardly, and he scrambled to stop them before tripping over one. \"Now we might neednthat new house,\" Mercedes teased lightly, coming back to help himnget up. Mateo looked up at her sadly. \"I ruinedneverything.\" \"You didn't ruinnanything,\" she countered, brushing off his shirt. \"You just got anlittle caught up. Look, thanks to you we have plenty of wood.\" \"All over thenfloor,\" he mumbled, moving to grab one. \"I'll clean itnup,\" she offered, beating him to it. \"Why don't you go findnPedro to play with you?\" He hesitated, and she nudged him towardnthe door. \"Go on, see if he wants to kick the ball around.\" Mateo reluctantlynstood up and made his way to the yard. He could see Pedro talking tonhis friends further up the road. Pedro would play with him if henasked him to, he knew, but he didn't want to bother him right now.nHe looked like he was having fun. Turning, Mateonwandered through the gate to the garden, situating himself right innfront of the vegetables Mercedes was growing. He slid down and putnhis elbows on his knees, observing the labeled poles. She wouldn'tnmind if he had one little carrot, he decided, reaching for thenleaves. Look, this is anmandrake root. A plant that dreamt of being human. \"What?\"nMateo withdrew his hand. Where had he heard that before? He'd keptnMercedes company while she was working back here, and had even beennallowed to plant some of the seeds, and he'd never heard hernmention any mandrakes. He shook his head and grabbed the top of thencarrot again. It wouldn't move. Mateo frowned. Theynwere definitely ready to harvest, because Mercedes was using some ofnthe tomatoes right now. It wasn't as though they'd just startedngrowing. He tugged harder. It moved a tiny bit, but slipped rightnback down again. Something was pulling his carrot! \"Let go!\" henprotested, though he had no idea what was down there. \"Inonly…wanted…one!\" He gasped in shock asnwhatever it was let go and he toppled backwards. The carrot wasnintact, but that hardly mattered. Mateo crawled over and plunged hisnhand down the hole. There was definitely something moving aroundnunder all that dirt—he felt it! Why wouldn't it slow down? Yanking his hand back,nhe rolled up his sleeve before trying again. If it was a bug, it wasnlike none he'd ever encountered. Most bugs couldn't hold back annentire carrot. There! He closed his handnaround the thin object and brought his whole forearm back to thensurface. It was wiggling in his hands, but he was much too curious tonjust let go. He could see the spindly legs that weren't enclosed innhis fist kicking wildly at the air, and his interest was piqued evennmore. Carefully, he opened his hand without leaving enough room fornit to run away. \"A stick bug?\" henran his finger over its twiggy body. \"How did you ever put up thatnbig of a fight?\" Mateo felt slightly disappointed—he'd beennexpecting some kind of freakish spider or maybe an grasshopper ofnepic proportions. Something scary , at least. He gently set thenbug back down and was surprised to see it try to climb onto his shoe. \"No, you go backndown now.\" He pried it off and once more put it where he'd foundnit. \"Sorry to have bothered you.\" Picking up his carrot,nhe rose. Pedro's friends were leaving now—maybe he would go asknhim to play. The ball was right by the gate, so he picked it up onnthe way out, the bug already forgotten. He took off running down thenentryway, calling Pedro, who greeted him with a friendly slap on thenback. The bug cocked itsnhead to the side. A moment later, at an impressive speed, it hoppednout of the hole the carrot had come out of and slipped under thengate. Mateo was so busy trying to block Pedro from kicking the ballnpast him that he didn't even notice it latch onto the back of hisnshirt.[Chapter 3] Mateo had let Pedro win—at least, that's what he told Mercedes over thenduration of their dinner. After that, he had gone straight up to hisnroom, a rare occurrence, and flopped on his back onto the bed. Henwondered where on earth rebels found the time to learn suchnridiculous soccer skills, then shut his eyes, arms bent supportingnhis head. The quiet breeze signaling dusk was audible outside hisnhalf-open window, as well as some distant talking. A skittering soundnechoed over the windowsill, but he paid it very little mind, as henwas already half-asleep; it was probably just some stray leaf fromnthe tree that stood not three feet away, anyway. Mateo shiftedngently, and heard the noise again over his floorboards…like someonenwas drumming their fingernails on the ground as quickly and lightlynas they could. He opened one eye and leaned enough over the edge ofnhis bed so as to not have to actually move. Of course, there wasnnothing. He inwardly rolled his eyes and propped his head back ontonthe pillow. \" Whoa !\" henshot backwards against his headboard after having come face-to-facenwith a pair of glassy, unfocused eyes. Whoever said stick bugs werenharmless had obviously never gotten close enough to one—just thensight of it was enough to wake him up ten times over. \"You're not thatnsame bug that was pulling on that carrot, are you?\" he asked inndisbelief. A second later, he sighed incredulously. Why did he keepntalking to that thing as if it could answer him? All it did was makena soft whirring noise and cock its head to the side. It was, in fact,nmaking that motion now as Mateo reorganized himself. He held out onenhand, and the bug, in its awkward, jerky stride, settled itself innits palm. It curled up almost instantly and seemed to stretch out innall directions, while two of its limbs disappeared back into itsnbody. It was all he could do not to flip his hand over and drop itnwhen the stick bug ceased to be an insect at all. \"Wha—what—you'rena…!\" he could barely even remember the word for it as it stood upnon its two remaining legs, arms and wings folded in indignance. Hensearched his mind in his state of bewilderment. Faerie. By now, it was sittingnpatiently, cross-legged in his outstretched hand, watching hisnfingers with suspicion to be sure they didn't come curlingnunexpectedly. When it was evident that Mateo was somewhat calm, thenbeing rose and hopped onto the windowsill with ease. \"Wait, where are youngoing?\" he scrambled to unfold his covers and lope across the room.nThe faerie leaned back onto the glass and pointed towards the woodsnhis room faced. When Mateo simply blinked, it repeated the gesture,nthis time more firmly. \"Is there somethingnout there I'm supposed to see?\" The faerie shook itsnhead, then reconsidered and nodded. Its wings jetted it upwards andnover the sill, and it motioned towards the trees yet again. \"Right now?\" Mateonseemed uncertain. \"I'm not really allowed out once I tellnMercedes I've gone to bed, you know. I could get into trouble;nshe'd take away my soccer ball again.\" The response henreceived consisted of a blank stare and arms thrown up innexasperation. When it flew towards the woods, circled back around andnpointed again insistently, Mateo sighed in defeat. \"Fine, I'm coming.nBut if I get caught, you'd better stick around to prove I wasn'tnsneaking out or something.\" The faerie seemed to mull this over,nbut its reply was not a definite yes. Mateo figured he would give itnthe benefit of the doubt and eased the window up a few more inches.nFollowing the faerie's lead, he extended one leg over and onto thenfoothold of the outside frame. It wasn't as though he hadn't donenthis before, after all. He let go of the window once he had regainednall his balance, and landed in the grass with a soft thump. Brushingnoff his cotton pajama shirt, Mateo shook himself off and begannwalking into the general direction of the forest. He only hoped henwasn't sleepwalking— that would be horrificallynembarrassing. The faerie, now illuminated by some inner glow, guidednhim around bends and over rocks until he reached an area cast inntotal shadow. Even lit by the moon, he could not tell what it wasnjust by looking. Mateo, now more intrigued than cynical, circled itnuntil he reached a giant opening. \"What is it? Is it ancave?\" The glowing creaturenshook its head and zipped in a zigzag motion, watching the boynhopefully. \"A maze?\" henguessed slowly, before snapping his fingers. \"A labyrinth! That'snwhat they're called, we learned about those in school! They'rensupposed to be so hard to get in and out of...\" When the faerie seemednto be gesturing for him to enter, Mateo took a generous step back. \" Oh , no, younmust be crazy. I'd get lost and never be heard from again! Even ifnI did find my way out, Mercedes would kill me!\" The only sound henheard in response was the distant chirping of crickets. Gently, thenfaerie circled its arms around Mateo's fingertip and tugged. \"Are you sure I'vengot to go in there?\" he asked weakly, already moving towards it.nBefore now, his surprise and awe at its monstrous size had distractednhim from what should have been a very obvious sense of fear. For hisnage, he was bright, and knew enough about dark, secluded places tonconclude that they were not someplace a twelve year old boy shouldnbe, alone, at night. \"I'm not really alone, though,\" he mused, curiosity beginning to win him over.n\"You're here, right? And you know your way around this thing?\"nHe held it up closer to the doorway, bricks cast into a slight bluenlight as he did so. Eagerly, it nodded. \"Anything to get mento say yes, huh? All right then, let's go.\" He shuffled inside,ndead leaves making gunshot sounds under his feet. He could feel thenhedges that had grown erratically around it poking at his legs whennhe got too close, and tried not to imagine what kind of things mightnbe living inside them. There were so many corners and bends; he hadnheard about mazes, of course, but being inside one was like beingntrapped inside the biggest, most twisted box. It seemed an eternitynhad passed by the time they stopped walking. They had reached a deadnend, and Mateo was now thoroughly apprehensive. He began to backnaway, but when the faerie shone itself on some previously-hiddennsteps, he reconsidered. \"Where exactly donthose go?\" By now, he had takennto talking to this strange being, for comfort more than anything.nThough it did not seem to have the ability to communicate verbally,nits body language and gestures were enough to bridge the languagengap. At this time of night, standing near stairs that led into blacknnothing, Mateo was willing to take whatever he could get. He cradlednthe faerie in his hands and, taking a deep breath, began his descent. At several points, henwondered out loud if he was walking straight down into Hell. Hendecided, after careful deliberation, that he must not be, simplynbecause of how dark it was. Mercedes had mentioned flames, and lotsnof them. It wasn't adding up, so he dismissed that theory. Maybenthe stairs just led to the center of the Earth. That might notnbe so bad, unless he came up on the other side in the middle of thenocean. His imagination would gladly have expanded on that thought hadnthe end of the steps not become visible at that moment. Once he touchednbottom, the faerie lightly escaped his grasp and seemed to dissolveninto the black. Mateo felt himself panic. How on earth was hensupposed to go back up those stairs and through the woods, home,nsafely? At all? He had no recollection of how he'd actually gottennthere in terms of direction. Mateo was certain, more and more as anslight scraping sound coming from a far wall grew louder, that he wasngoing to die here, in this cave, before he would even have a chancento regret coming. Backing away slowly, he allowed himself to look fornthe source of the noises, breath coming out in jerky gasps. \" What are you …?\" For the record, thisnis, in fact, where the real story begins. I'm appalled with myselfnfor how long it took to update this, but now I know where I want itnto go. uf04a -Katie[Chapter 4] \"What am I?\" angravelly voice echoed, detaching itself from some dead foliagencrowding its corner. \"Don't you know a faun when you see one?\" \"N-no,\" Mateonstammered, not quite sure which way to turn. \"I-I c-can't reallynsee you in this l-light…\" he swallowed loudly, \"and I'vennever seen a…a faun before.\" The faerie had flownnto the mysterious-looking entity and was now perched on its shoulder,nwatching with interest. The faun stretched itself out, and Mateo wasngradually able to become accustomed enough to the dark to make outnwhat it looked like. The best word he could think of was creepy .nIt wasn't horrifying, but there was something unnerving about thosenslate-colored eyes…the tangled beard and horns weren't helpingnmuch either. The faun drew closer and gave Mateo a once-over. \"Oh, mostndefinitely,\" it said in that low-as-the-ground voice. \"Most definitelynwhat?\" \"What do they callnyou?\" the faun asked curiously, as if the boy's question hadnnever been uttered. \"I…well, m-mynname's, uh, Mateo. That's what most people call me, anyway.\" Hentoed the ground lightly and tried to regulate his breathing. Thisncreature didn't look malicious or anything…in fact, once you gotnused to him, he was more interesting than sinister. Mateo hadn'tnquite reached that point yet, but he was getting there. \"And…andnyou?\" \"I have many names,\"nit sighed in a strange tone. \"Over the years, I have acquired annumber of them, the majority of which only the trees can pronounce.nYou, however…you may call me Pan.\" \"Pan.\" Mateonbreathed softly. \"And this is your labyrinth?\" \"I have been herenfor quite some time, yes.\" Pan gestured to his corner. \"That isnmy resting place, and for several years it has been fairly tranquil.\"nHe leaned closer, horns becoming more visible. \"But that had tonend.\" \"Why?\" Mateonsuddenly feared he was trespassing, eyes glued on Pan's horns. \"I'mnnot bothering you, am I?\" It took him a momentnto register the strange sound emitting from the faun afterwards asnlaughter, as it was so low he could hardly hear it. \"I am the one whonarranged for you to be here,\" Pan said, circling the floornof the enclosure slowly. \"It's time you knew.\" \"Knew…what?\" \"They've kept anlot from you, haven't they?\" Pan rested his cheek on one arm. \"Innever imagined you would be this in the dark, not with so many othernmortals around you who know what occurred…\" \"Wait, what? Didnsomething bad happen?\" Mateo, by now, had relocated to a large rocknin the middle of the floor. He was sitting on one edge, legs crossed,nnow more eager to hear the story than afraid of the faun. \"Wouldnyou tell me?\" \"It is a longnstory.\" Pan regarded him with some amusement. \"I want to know whatnhappened,\" the boy pressed. \"Did something happen to me? Isnsomething going to?\" \"Centuries ago,\"nthe gravelly voice began, \"there was a beautiful princess, anprincess of the Underworld. Her name was Moanna, and she was hernfather's pride and joy—until, of course, the day her curiosityngot the better of her. You see, she had never seen the sun, nor knownnlight. Unbeknownst to those keeping watch over her, she slipped awaynand climbed the stairs to your world, coming into contact with thensun for the first time.\" \"What does a fairyntale have to do with me?\" Thoroughly confused, Mateo was unable tonmake any sort of connection. He knew it was probably best not tonactually argue with the massive faun speaking to him, but hisnperplexity was growing with every word. He had the right to ask,nanyway, didn't he? \"But,\" Panncontinued, \"she was a princess of the Underworld , and shenwas blinded by its rays, forgetting instantly who she was and wherenshe came from…she joined your world as a mortal, with no way ofnreturning.\" At this, an audiblensigh had escaped his mouth. \"No way.\" \"So she's herennow?\" \"She was.\" Panngave him a pointed look. \"Twelve years ago this night, I was havingna conversation of this magnitude with Moanna herself—Ofelia, as shenwas called by your people. Of course, she had no recollectionnwhatsoever of who she was—but such a sweet girl. Right in the midstnof a war, and she had no place to be. Knowing that despicable captainnshe had to endure living with, it was a miracle she had made it thatnfar. That was my one chance, my chance to bring her back to us.\" By now, Mateo wasnriveted, sitting fully on the edge of the rock. \"What happenednnext?\" \"She was given threentasks,\" Pan replied, holding up his fingers. \"Three veryndifficult, very dangerous tasks, to prove she was worthy of returningnto her kingdom instead of remaining here, with those who would harmnher.\" A ghost of a smile seemed to appear on his face as he said,n\"Naturally, she failed the second miserably. It was hard to blamenher, but I knew what I needed to do. After much deliberation, itnbecame evident that she had to have one more chance.\" \"Did she fail thatnchance?\" \" No ,\" Pannbreathed softly. \"No, on the surface it may have seemed as thoughnshe did. She did not do as she was told; but you see, Mateo, that was the test. Hearing how fervently she denied me my request, knowingnthis would mean forfeiting ever returning to the Underworld as anprincess…what a bittersweet ending.\" \"Ending?\" \"Joyous, of course,nbecause this meant our Moanna could finally come home; but in ordernfor that to take place, she had to die.\" Pan gazed at an indefinitenspot on the wall behind Mateo, expression thoughtful. \"It was all Incould do not to kill the man who was responsible for that.\" \"Who was that? Whatnhappened?\" Mateo was positively vibrating with anxious excitement.nHe was getting the feeling that this story pertained to him in a verynsignificant way, though he had no way of placing exactly how. \"This is where youncome in,\" Pan's rough voice interjected. \"Ofelia was on a questnto find out who she was. Tonight, I am placing you on the same one.nAll too soon, the true story will become clear for you.\" He cockednhis head to the side. \"That is, if you can successfullyncomplete the tasks I am going to give you.\" \"Are theyndangerous?\" Mateo tried not to let himself stammer, but afternhearing how someone else had gone so far as to be killed, it wasndifficult. \"It depends on hownloosely you define the term 'dangerous'.\" Pan released hisnfaerie, which now hovered protectively near the boy. \"Your firstnwill not be. Progressively, they will become more so.\" \"How many am I tondo, before…?\" \"Three tasks are allnthat is necessary for you to know what you need to.\" Pan paused,nlooking amused. \"After the first, you'll find that you havenacquired something to help you along the way.\" \"Tell me what I neednto do,\" Mateo breathlessly answered. \"I need to know whatnhappens.\" \"Very well,\" Pannrumbled, pointing to the stairs. \"Up those stairs, through thatnforest, my faerie will show you the way. There is a book to be found,nbut you must dig for it, for it has been hidden. That book isnessential to your journey, and finding it is not so difficult thatnyou cannot get back to your home on time. If you go now, you willnhave sufficient time to obtain it and return to your bed before younare missed.\" \"What happens afternI find it?\" \"You open it, ofncourse.\" The blatant shock in Pan's voice was almost humorous.n\"What else would you do with it?\" \"That's not what Inmeant,\" Mateo said hastily. \"I meant, what happens next? Do Inneed to come find you again?\" \"Within the nextnthree nights, I will once again send my faerie to fetch you. When itncomes to you, you come to me. Bring your book, understood?\" \"Yes, of course.\"nMateo rose from his rock, now uncertain as to whether or not he wasncapable of accomplishing what this faun expected of him. To benhonest, he was afraid to find out what would happen if he failed. He decided it best not to ask about that. \"Mateo, one lastnthing.\" Pan held one arm out, as if to signal him not to departnyet. \"Under no circumstances should you let that book be taken fromnyou. Better yet, do not even let it be seen. Keep it to yourself.\" \"Okay, Pan.\" Thenfull moon was streaming at such an angle through the slanted tunnelnas to illuminate Mateo's silhouette. His soft curls seemed to glownwith moonshine as he turned to leave. Suddenly, he wheeled backnaround. \"But what if—?\" Silence. Aside fromnthe faerie flitting right next to him, he was alone. He tried in vainnto search for Pan, but all he could see was a slightly rustling patchnof dead vines in the corner. \"How does he donthat?\" he mused. The faerie shrugged and settled cross-legged ontonhis shoulder. \"I guess we'd better go find that book, then.\" The climb back to realnground was less nerve-wracking than the descent, but Mateo was stillnhappy for the companionship of the small creature sitting on him.nOnce he reached the expanse of trees he had come from, he glancednaround. \"You need to leadnthe way now, okay?\" he said softly to the faerie. \"I need to knownexactly where to go, and Pan said you were the one to show me.\"nObediently, it rose, gave the surrounding a quick once-over, then litnup and flew closer to the direction they had originally left from.nMateo followed closely, checking every tree they passed. Afternabout ten minutes, they stopped. The faerie gently floated downwardnand came to rest on a gathering of fallen leaves. \"Here?\" Mateonbrushed some of them away, and then frowned. The dirt was hard, andnwould most likely not come loose very easily. He tried kicking at it,nand scraping with a stick. That yielded him some form of results, sonhe kept at it. Once enough earth had been removed, he abandoned thenbranch and began scooping with his hands. There were sharp rocksninside the sediment, but he ignored their constant attack on hisnarms. The faerie was kneeling at the top of the hole he was making,nsilently cheering him on. Mateo's breathing was becoming morenlabored as he dug deeper, finally reaching something that did notnfeel like the dirt he had been going at for the past however long. \"Hey, maybe this isnit.\" He rolled up his sleeve and reached one arm all the wayninside, feeling for the outline of a book. \"I think it is!\" Hisneyes lit up, and he tugged it from where it was resting. After someneffort, he swung his arm up and produced a very dusty hardback. \"Look at this!\" henexclaimed, reaching to open the cover. \"I can't wait to seenwhat— ow !\" He withdrew his hand, and swatted at thenoffending something that had delivered one sharp pinch to hisnforearm. When he saw the spider fly back onto the ground, he wasnhorrified. Spider bitten in the middle of the night? What if itnwas poisonous? There was no way of knowing for sure, other than tonwait. He sighed and shook his arm loosely. He could still feel it, sonthat had to be a good sign. If in the time frame it took him to walknback home, something changed, he would simply go to Mercedes and tellnher a spider had been hiding under his pillow. It wasn't as thoughnhe getting bitten by assorted insects would come as any sort of shocknto her, after all. She was used to it. \"Come on,\" henwhispered, tucking the book under his uninjured arm and rising tonleave. The faerie hovered over the bitten area and placed both handsnupon it, glowing brightly. Before he could react, the pain hadnstopped. \"Thank you,\" hensaid, reaching to pat it gently. \"That helps a lot.\" With that,nthey finished the walk to the house in relative quiet. Mateo was ablento get up onto the branch of the tree near his window and scurrynalong the side of those house, using handholds and footholds he camenup with on the spot. Once he had wiggled into his half-open window,nhe leaped back into bed and waited to be sure no one had heard himncoming. When he was certainnhis arrival had gone unnoticed, Mateo eased the book out from undernhis covers and turned up his lamp gently. He used one of his blanketsnto wipe off the front, trying to make out a title. It was difficultnin that lighting, so he turned the lamp up more and opened the book.nThe faerie had nudged itself into a comfortable space to be able tonobserve what was in it, and seemed just as eager as he was. \"It's empty,\" henwhispered in disbelief. He turned to the creature on his left andnrepeated, \"It's totally empty. What was the point of that if—?\" He was cut short whennthe faerie actually slapped him lightly on the shoulder and pointednagain. \" Whoa ,\" henbreathed upon seeing words literally flowing onto the page. Picturesndrew themselves in the darkest ink, and columns of writing appearednout of nowhere. It was some sort of guide, that much he was sure of.nAwed, he flipped through the pages, reading about the various thingsnit explained. Magical creatures. Mandrakes. Mazes. Minotaurs. Moanna. Mateonstopped dead on that page. Moanna, that princess Pan had been talkingnabout, was in this book. \"Isnthis what I'm supposed to be reading about?\" he asked, alreadynscanning the information. It covered all of what Pan told him, butnhis eyes stopped at the part where she was living as a girl namednOfelia. Brightly colored pictures of her came and went, going aboutnher life. Hernlooking over her shoulder at a strangely-shaped scar. Hernreaching under a bed to feed what looked like a mandrake root nestednin a bowl. Herndesperately trying to draw on an earthen ceiling with some kind ofnmagical chalk. Herncradling a baby in her arms. \"Whonis that?\" he whispered, trying to get a closer look. The textninverted itself and spun back as a whole new paragraph. He eagerlynread the sentences out loud. \"Before Ofelianwas killed, she was known to have had one brother, one survivingnbrother whom she died to protect. Seen here with baby Mateo, Ofelianwatches over him carefully as always.\" Mateo felt his breathncatch and read it one more time to be sure he wasn't mistaken. The last thing henremembered was echoing the same two sentences, over and over.","LastChapter":"\"What am I?\" angravelly voice echoed, detaching itself from some dead foliagencrowding its corner. \"Don't you know a faun when you see one?\" \"N-no,\" Mateonstammered, not quite sure which way to turn. \"I-I c-can't reallynsee you in this l-light…\" he swallowed loudly, \"and I'vennever seen a…a faun before.\" The faerie had flownnto the mysterious-looking entity and was now perched on its shoulder,nwatching with interest.

That was my one chance, my chance to bring her back to us.\" By now, Mateo wasnriveted, sitting fully on the edge of the rock. \"What happenednnext?\" \"She was given threentasks,\" Pan replied, holding up his fingers. \"Three veryndifficult, very dangerous tasks, to prove she was worthy of returningnto her kingdom instead of remaining here, with those who would harmnher.\" A ghost of a smile seemed to appear on his face as he said,n\"Naturally, she failed the second miserably. It was hard to blamenher, but I knew what I needed to do. After much deliberation, itnbecame evident that she had to have one more chance.\" \"Did she fail thatnchance?\" \" No ,\" Pannbreathed softly. \"No, on the surface it may have seemed as thoughnshe did. She did not do as she was told; but you see, Mateo, that was the test. Hearing how fervently she denied me my request, knowingnthis would mean forfeiting ever returning to the Underworld as anprincess…what a bittersweet ending.\" \"Ending?\" \"Joyous, of course,nbecause this meant our Moanna could finally come home; but in ordernfor that to take place, she had to die.\" Pan gazed at an indefinitenspot on the wall behind Mateo, expression thoughtful. \"It was all Incould do not to kill the man who was responsible for that.\" \"Who was that? Whatnhappened?\" Mateo was positively vibrating with anxious excitement.nHe was getting the feeling that this story pertained to him in a verynsignificant way, though he had no way of placing exactly how. \"This is where youncome in,\" Pan's rough voice interjected. \"Ofelia was on a questnto find out who she was. Tonight, I am placing you on the same one.nAll too soon, the true story will become clear for you.\" He cockednhis head to the side. \"That is, if you can successfullyncomplete the tasks I am going to give you.\" \"Are theyndangerous?\" Mateo tried not to let himself stammer, but afternhearing how someone else had gone so far as to be killed, it wasndifficult. \"It depends on hownloosely you define the term 'dangerous'.\" Pan released hisnfaerie, which now hovered protectively near the boy. \"Your firstnwill not be. Progressively, they will become more so.\" \"How many am I tondo, before…?\" \"Three tasks are allnthat is necessary for you to know what you need to.\" Pan paused,nlooking amused. \"After the first, you'll find that you havenacquired something to help you along the way.\" \"Tell me what I neednto do,\" Mateo breathlessly answered. \"I need to know whatnhappens.\" \"Very well,\" Pannrumbled, pointing to the stairs. \"Up those stairs, through thatnforest, my faerie will show you the way. There is a book to be found,nbut you must dig for it, for it has been hidden. That book isnessential to your journey, and finding it is not so difficult thatnyou cannot get back to your home on time. If you go now, you willnhave sufficient time to obtain it and return to your bed before younare missed.\" \"What happens afternI find it?\" \"You open it, ofncourse.\" The blatant shock in Pan's voice was almost humorous.n\"What else would you do with it?\" \"That's not what Inmeant,\" Mateo said hastily. \"I meant, what happens next? Do Inneed to come find you again?\" \"Within the nextnthree nights, I will once again send my faerie to fetch you. When itncomes to you, you come to me. Bring your book, understood?\" \"Yes, of course.\"nMateo rose from his rock, now uncertain as to whether or not he wasncapable of accomplishing what this faun expected of him. To benhonest, he was afraid to find out what would happen if he failed. He decided it best not to ask about that. \"Mateo, one lastnthing.\" Pan held one arm out, as if to signal him not to departnyet. \"Under no circumstances should you let that book be taken fromnyou. Better yet, do not even let it be seen. Keep it to yourself.\" \"Okay, Pan.\" Thenfull moon was streaming at such an angle through the slanted tunnelnas to illuminate Mateo's silhouette. His soft curls seemed to glownwith moonshine as he turned to leave. Suddenly, he wheeled backnaround. \"But what if—?\" Silence. Aside fromnthe faerie flitting right next to him, he was alone. He tried in vainnto search for Pan, but all he could see was a slightly rustling patchnof dead vines in the corner. \"How does he donthat?\" he mused. The faerie shrugged and settled cross-legged ontonhis shoulder. \"I guess we'd better go find that book, then.\" The climb back to realnground was less nerve-wracking than the descent, but Mateo was stillnhappy for the companionship of the small creature sitting on him.nOnce he reached the expanse of trees he had come from, he glancednaround. \"You need to leadnthe way now, okay?\" he said softly to the faerie. \"I need to knownexactly where to go, and Pan said you were the one to show me.\"nObediently, it rose, gave the surrounding a quick once-over, then litnup and flew closer to the direction they had originally left from.nMateo followed closely, checking every tree they passed. Afternabout ten minutes, they stopped. The faerie gently floated downwardnand came to rest on a gathering of fallen leaves. \"Here?\" Mateonbrushed some of them away, and then frowned. The dirt was hard, andnwould most likely not come loose very easily. He tried kicking at it,nand scraping with a stick. That yielded him some form of results, sonhe kept at it. Once enough earth had been removed, he abandoned thenbranch and began scooping with his hands. There were sharp rocksninside the sediment, but he ignored their constant attack on hisnarms. The faerie was kneeling at the top of the hole he was making,nsilently cheering him on. Mateo's breathing was becoming morenlabored as he dug deeper, finally reaching something that did notnfeel like the dirt he had been going at for the past however long. \"Hey, maybe this isnit.\" He rolled up his sleeve and reached one arm all the wayninside, feeling for the outline of a book. \"I think it is!\" Hisneyes lit up, and he tugged it from where it was resting. After someneffort, he swung his arm up and produced a very dusty hardback. \"Look at this!\" henexclaimed, reaching to open the cover. \"I can't wait to seenwhat— ow !\" He withdrew his hand, and swatted at thenoffending something that had delivered one sharp pinch to hisnforearm. When he saw the spider fly back onto the ground, he wasnhorrified. Spider bitten in the middle of the night? What if itnwas poisonous? There was no way of knowing for sure, other than tonwait. He sighed and shook his arm loosely. He could still feel it, sonthat had to be a good sign. If in the time frame it took him to walknback home, something changed, he would simply go to Mercedes and tellnher a spider had been hiding under his pillow. It wasn't as thoughnhe getting bitten by assorted insects would come as any sort of shocknto her, after all. She was used to it. \"Come on,\" henwhispered, tucking the book under his uninjured arm and rising tonleave. The faerie hovered over the bitten area and placed both handsnupon it, glowing brightly. Before he could react, the pain hadnstopped. \"Thank you,\" hensaid, reaching to pat it gently. \"That helps a lot.\" With that,nthey finished the walk to the house in relative quiet. Mateo was ablento get up onto the branch of the tree near his window and scurrynalong the side of those house, using handholds and footholds he camenup with on the spot. Once he had wiggled into his half-open window,nhe leaped back into bed and waited to be sure no one had heard himncoming. When he was certainnhis arrival had gone unnoticed, Mateo eased the book out from undernhis covers and turned up his lamp gently. He used one of his blanketsnto wipe off the front, trying to make out a title. It was difficultnin that lighting, so he turned the lamp up more and opened the book.nThe faerie had nudged itself into a comfortable space to be able tonobserve what was in it, and seemed just as eager as he was. \"It's empty,\" henwhispered in disbelief. He turned to the creature on his left andnrepeated, \"It's totally empty. What was the point of that if—?\" He was cut short whennthe faerie actually slapped him lightly on the shoulder and pointednagain. \" Whoa ,\" henbreathed upon seeing words literally flowing onto the page. Picturesndrew themselves in the darkest ink, and columns of writing appearednout of nowhere. It was some sort of guide, that much he was sure of.nAwed, he flipped through the pages, reading about the various thingsnit explained. Magical creatures. Mandrakes. Mazes. Minotaurs. Moanna. Mateonstopped dead on that page. Moanna, that princess Pan had been talkingnabout, was in this book. \"Isnthis what I'm supposed to be reading about?\" he asked, alreadynscanning the information. It covered all of what Pan told him, butnhis eyes stopped at the part where she was living as a girl namednOfelia. Brightly colored pictures of her came and went, going aboutnher life. Hernlooking over her shoulder at a strangely-shaped scar. Hernreaching under a bed to feed what looked like a mandrake root nestednin a bowl. Herndesperately trying to draw on an earthen ceiling with some kind ofnmagical chalk. Herncradling a baby in her arms. \"Whonis that?\" he whispered, trying to get a closer look. The textninverted itself and spun back as a whole new paragraph. He eagerlynread the sentences out loud. \"Before Ofelianwas killed, she was known to have had one brother, one survivingnbrother whom she died to protect. Seen here with baby Mateo, Ofelianwatches over him carefully as always.\" Mateo felt his breathncatch and read it one more time to be sure he wasn't mistaken. The last thing henremembered was echoing the same two sentences, over and over.","Summary":" Ofelia: You'll see, when she smiles, you'll love her I don't ownnOfelia, Pan, or anyone else in thi","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  K+ - English - Chapters: 4   - Words: 5,568 - Reviews: 23 - Favs: 22 - Follows: 35 - Updated: 6 3 2009 - Published: 6 9 2008 - id: 4311638 "},{"Movie":"Rocky","Title":"Broken","Author":"MJ1010","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6309943","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I hope this is worth your time. Enjoy. It was late. His bones were sore. It had been a long day. He wore his leather jacket with pride as he strolled down the streets of Philly. His father gave him this jacket. Right before he died. Being the son of a heavy weight champion was a difficult burden sometimes. They never saw Rocky Jr. Just Rocky. With his rich black hair, deep chocolate brown eyes, and Italian complexion he was the mirror image of his father. They had a rough relationship. He was ashamed of himself for keeping his father at a distance after his mother passed away. When Rocky Jr. thought back to all that time they had wasted, it often left him with an ache that he knew would never go away. The streets still chanted his father's name. He was a great man. Rocky Jr. wished he knew him better. He made his way to his apartment building. There was no space or privacy in these homes. The buildings touched, just enough to remind him of that. He ran a hand through his hair and sighed. His father had left him Adrian's . The restaurant he opened after his mother had passed. It was a tribute to her. Rocky even used some of her recipe's and said it was the next best thing to having her home. He envied the love between his parents. It couldn't be described in words. He remembered visiting his mother in the hospital toward the end when she was sick. The tension between father and son was at it's peak. But she always managed to calm them. Bring them together. Rocky Jr. glanced back as he left the room and his father leaned down to kiss his wife's forehead. He gently wiped the tears from her eyes and told her he loved her. She didn't have to say it back. It was in her eyes. It always was. She passed the day after. His father was lost for a while after that. And no matter how many times he tried to reach out to his son, he was always too busy. Rocky Jr. sat on the steps in front of his building. The heavy burden of life crashed down around him. He was lost in thought until he heard someone talking to him. She had to repeat herself twice because he couldn't get over how beautiful she was. \"Excuse me, is this East Tusculum Street?\" She hesitated as he continued to stare. He shook his head yes, feeling foolish. She was stunning. Even in the pale glow of the street lights. She had dark chestnut hair and a heart shaped face. But it was her eyes that captivated him. They were kind. Sweet. She reminded him of his mother. \"Thank you.\" She began up the stairs. She was looking at the directory. \"Are you looking for someone?\" He asked. \"Yes actually. Rocky Balboa Jr.?\" She read his name off of a wrinkled piece of paper. \"That's me.\" He said, suddenly suspicious. \"Oh. Hello.\" She smiled at him. He remained silent. \"My name is Brianna Concetti. I work for Mr. Tony Ever's. You may know him by his nickname. Duke. He trained Mr. Apollo Creed and then well, as you may know, he trained your father.\" Rocky Jr. remained silent. The subject of his father always put him on the defense. \"I'm here to offer you a rare opportunity Mr. Balboa.\" He cringed at hearing his name said like that. Cold. Business-like. \"We know that you have been training at a local gym. We also know that you've signed up for local sparring matches and competitions. From what we hear, and read, you're pretty good.\" She hesitated. \"Better then good.\" He shrugged not admitting to anything yet. \"Mr. Evers would like to train you Mr. Balboa. I'll be honest. You're father was a legend. His legacy is yours now. You seem to have inherited his south paw style and that's difficult but we will be able to train you to use both…\" She continued to speak and he held up a hand to stop her. \"Excuse me, but what exactly are you offering me here? Train me for what?\" She stared at him as if he had two heads. \"For a chance at the title Mr. Balboa. The heavy weight champion knows of your father and knows of you. He desperatley wants to set up a fight with you. Unfinished business he says. You may know him? His name is Franky Gunn. Tommy Gunn's son.\" At the mention of that name, Rocky Jr.'s blood boiled beyond comprehension. That man was the start of the tension between his father and him. Rocky made a lot of mistakes in his life. And letting a perfect stranger take his son's place was one of them. \"Not interested.\" Rocky Jr. began up the steps. \"But wait,\" She chased after him. \"Don't you understand? This could mean fame or fortune.\" \"No thanks.\" Rocky Jr. remembered the days when his mother lectured his father on fighting. She hated it. Rocky Jr. hated that he loved it. \"Please, at least take my card and think about it.\" She handed it to him. He took one last look at her and walked inside. His apartment was dark. Empty. Quiet. He flipped the card over and over in his hands. If he did this, would his father be the only one anyone ever saw? If he did win, would his victory be stolen by his father's name? He wrestled with the idea relentlessly. He rubbed his tired eyes and stared at the number. Concetti, nice Italian name. He smiled. His father would like her. Sighing, he reached for his cell and dialed her number. It seemed almost inevitable that he became a fighter. After all, it was in his blood.[Chapter 2] Thanks for the feedback! Enjoy. Rocky Jr. walked into the gym, acting like a guy with confidence, secretly knowing better. Sweat and determination filled the air. He heard grunts and the pounding of heavy weight bags. In an instant, he was young again, watching his father. There was a magic to the way he moved. He thought back to one day in particular… \" Ayo, Pauley. You brought the kid with you?\" His father, a legend in his son's eyes, took out his mouthpiece to smile at him. He felt pride whenever his father noticed him. He felt important. Rocky Jr. loved his father. Everyone knew that this seven year old kid from Philly worshipped his father. And he wasn't the only one. Mickey's gym was growing more popular by the minute. Tourists even came to snap photo's. Mickey had passed. A tragic day for the world of boxing. A devastating blow for Rocky. Time went on, but he knew even at a young age, that his father wasn't the same. It was in his eyes. He left half of his heart behind when they buried Mickey. \" Hey kid.\" Rocky looked down at his son. \" Yea dad?\" His smile was automatic. \" How 'bout you and me do some sparring.\" \" Really!\" Rocky Jr. jumped into the ring without hesitation. His mother hated fighting and would never let him in the ring. She would be mad if she knew he was here but Uncle Pauley said what she doesn't know won't hurt her. His gloves were taped around his wrist. His mouth guard was in. And his heart was pounding. He was going to spar with his dad. A real fighter. \" First thing, son,\" Rocky said as he bounced lightly from side to side, \"You have to be light on your feet.\" Rocky Jr charged for his dad and swung away ignoring the advice. Rocky laughed and held him at arms length. \" Let's try this again. Go back to your corner. Watch me.\" His father jabbed the air with his left. Then his right. Starting off slow, then speeding up. His fists were faster then lightning. Rocky Jr let his arms down in amazement. \" Now, follow me….\" His father said. And he did. For many years. Until time took him away… Rocky Jr. lifted his shoulders up and down, trying to loosen up. He came here not knowing what to expect. \"Rocky, so glad you came.\" Brianna welcomed him with a smile as bright as the sun. Rocky Jr. ignored his heart when it skipped a beat. At the mention of his father's name, everyone in the gym went still. He could feel a thousand eyes weighing him down. \"Please, call me Jr.\" He said, as he followed her to the center ring. \"Alright. This is where you will be training today. Duke will be out shortly. In the meantime, I will show you to your locker room.\" Rocky Jr. followed her and listened as she explained the rules of the gym. No steroids. No stealing. No unnecessary roughness. When she was done, she picked up a duffle bag and headed toward the back. \"Wait, where are you going?\" Rocky Jr. sounded pathetic, even to his own ears. \"To change in the women's locker room. Is that alright with you?\" She looked annoyed. But she couldn't have been more beautiful. \"Wait, change for what?\" He asked, immediately regretting it. \"Women box too.\" She stormed off not even bothering to glance back. Correction, now she was off the charts gorgeous. Rocky rubbed his neck and tried to shake the nerves. Duke was as much a legend as his father was. He trained his father. Rocky Jr. tried not to think of all the ways he knew he would never measure up. After he changed, he headed out to the main floor. The gym was busy. Buckets of spit were being replaced every two seconds. There were grunts of pure adrenalin as the intense work outs commensed. \"Well, well, Rocky Jr. It's an honor son.\" Duke greeted him with a smile and a handshake. \"I knew your father well. It's my pleasure to be training you.\" \"Thank you sir.\" Rocky Jr. didn't return the smile. He couldn't. Thoughts of his father always left him feeling conflicted. \"Shall we?\" Duke stepped on the rope to make an opening for him. Rocky Jr. shook his head in agreement. We shall. \"Stick the jab. Keep her head down!\" About a half hour later, Rocky Jr. was drenched in sweat. His opponent didn't look phased. Duke yelled at him over and over. He kept messing up. \"Again!\" Duke rang the bell. Rocky Jr. kept an eye on his opponent. He quickly darted to the right. Rocky Jr. jabbed with his left. He missed. A blinding pain shot across his torso as his opponent hit him in his side. He had an urge to hold his rib that was throbbing but his pride stopped him. Out of breath, he darted from left to right. Keeping light in his feet. He wasn't quick enough. Rocky Jr. flinched as he saw the hit coming. The glove connected with his jaw sending him flying into the ropes and landing on the mat. He fell hard. He was tempted to stay down. But he was determined not to give up. He pushed himself up with the last bit of strength he had, only to be knocked down again. Disappointed in himself, he screamed and tossed off his headgear. He made it back to the locker room before he noticed someone in the doorway. Rocky Jr. sat on a bench, silent. \"You know, giving up is never the answer.\" Duke's deep voice echoed off the walls. \"Easy for you to say.\" Rocky Jr. looked down, ashamed. \"Son, it's not easy for me to say. Do you know how many times I wanted to quit this life? But I didn't. Because its as much a part of me as it is a part of you. But your heart has to be in it. Why did you say yes?\" \"What?\" Rocky Jr. glanced up. \"Why did you come here?\" Silence. \"Do you want to fight?\" \"I don't know.\" His mother's disapproving face flashed before his eyes. \"Well, until you figure it out, you're wasting both of our time. And it's a shame. Because you're actually quite good.\" Duke left Rocky Jr. brooding in silence. He knew she was there before he turned his head. \"Don't.\" Rocky Jr. whispered. \"I didn't say anything.\" Brianna replied. \"You didn't have too.\" \"Look,\" She said as she made her way to the bench and sat down, \"It's your first day. Don't give up.\" She looked at him. Concern in her eyes. Or was it pity? \"Maybe I'm not the guy you're looking for.\" He looked at her tenderly. \"You are the guy we're looking for. Problem is you don't see yourself.\" She got up to leave. She hesitated at the doorway and looked at him one last time. \"If you walk out that door today and never come back, then at least you can say you tried. But if you walk back in that ring right now you can say you conquered your fear. You can hold your head high, and know that so much greatness is in store for you. You just have to get out of your own way…\" \"And how do you know this about me?\" \"Because I see you.\" She smiled sadly at him and left him sitting on the bench alone and contemplating his future.","LastChapter":"Thanks for the feedback!

She gavenMr. Tweedy an angry stare and didn't say anything, \"Sorry\" hensaid to her. \"It's not my fault you're in a bad mood\" henadded, at hearing that she stepped on his foot. \"Ouch! What did Indo? I kept tellin' you they was organized, but did you believe me?nNo!\" he replied. \"You just don't want to admit I'm right,ndon't you?\" he asked, Mrs. Tweedy just rolled her eyes thenopposite direction. He laughed at her facial expression \"I knew it,nc'mon say it\" he said \"No\" Mrs. Tweedy answered. \"Say it\"nMr. Tweedy insisted. \"Ok… you were right and I was wrong\" Mrs.nTweedy replied \"I can't here you\" Mr. Tweedy said in a sort ofnsing song tone. \"You were right and I was wrong…Are you happynnow?\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him. \"That's all I need to know,nthank you\" he said to her before going back to reading his paper.n\"Oy, why did I let myself get into this?\" Mrs. Tweedy askedn\"'Cause you like me, that's why\" Mr. Tweedy answered. Hisnwife's eyes bucked \"Hold it, since when have I told you I likednyou?\" she asked him. \"Oh, I don't know…as long as we'venbeen married\" he replied with a laugh. \"Ay Chihuahua\" Mrs.nTweedy said to herself, \"You know what your problem is? You nevernthing big\" Mr. Tweedy said to her. \"My mother used to tell me thensame thing when I told her I was marrying you\" she replied. (I gotnthe lines from an old TV show called \"The Jeffersons\"). \"Feelnbetter?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, \"I guess so, I got it out of mynsystem\" Mrs. Tweedy replied. \"Yeah right\" her husband answered,n\"What do you mean by that?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked. \"I seem tonremember a certain someone with blue eyes who didn't talk to me forn3 days 'cause she claimed it was my fault that those chickensnescaped\" Mr. Tweedy said to her. \"Ohh, knock it off!\" shenanswered, she was feeling somewhat better she was half smiling fornone thing. \"Wait a minute… I just thought of something\" shencontinued. \"What?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, \"What are we gonna do forna source of income? I mean those chickens weren't worth much butnthey were our only source of income\" Mrs. Tweedy explained. \"Hey,ndon't worry we'll have something in a week… a week\" Mr.nTweedy answered. 3 Weeksnlater… \"Whyndon't we use your social security check?\" Mr. Tweedy asked as henlooked at one of the bills that came in the mail. \"Can't …wenalready used it on the car payment\" said Mrs. Tweedy. \"There'snno way around it\" Mr. Tweedy replied, the 2 of them both sighed.n\"We gotta find other options, we owe people too much money\" henexplained. \"How are we going to do that? Are you going to go outnand look for a job?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked. \"No I'm not goin' outnto look for a job\" said Mr. Tweedy, his wife sighed \"Look,nthere's got to be another job out there, all we have to do is look\"nMr. Tweedy continued. The nextnday… \"Wellnthis is the place\" he said, \"You gotta be kidding me\" said Mrs.nTweedy. \"Now it's not that bad\" Mr. Tweedy said to her, \"Wenare not working here\" she answered. \"Now let's just check itnout, looks can be deceiving\" he said, \"Looks can be deceiving?nWe're in a trailer park\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him. \"Shh, waitnhere\" he replied as he closed the door of the pick up truck. Henwalked up to a trailer and knocked on the door. An older woman whonlooked to be in her 50s or 60s answered the door. She had her blondnhair in plastic rollers. \"Yes?\" she asked, \"Hi, I'm herenabout the job offer, is this the place?\" Mr. Tweedy asked. \"Ohnyes it is, welcome to the…\" the blond woman stopped short andnstarted coughing. \"Sorry… welcome to the touch of sunshine jobnoffice, can I help you?\" she continued, \"Oh, uh…no thank you\"nMr. Tweedy replied. The dachshund the blond woman was holding lookednat him and whined in a friendly sort of tone. Laternthat day… \"Arenyou sure this is the right address?\" Mr. Tweedy asked \"That'snwhat the paper said\" Mrs. Tweedy replied. They noticed an 80 yearnold woman with black haired wig sitting on the porch fanning herself.n\"Hi\" Mr. Tweedy said to her, she got up \"We keep the employeesnright around here\" she answered. She opened the door to her cellar,nThe Tweedys were somewhat disturbed by what was down in the cellar.n\"Go ahead, you first ma'am\" said the farmer (the 80 year oldnwoman's husband). \"Ok\" Mrs. Tweedy answered and walked awaynwith her husband close behind her. \"Where'd you get the addressnfor this place?\" he asked \"No, you picked this place\" Mrs.nTweedy replied, \"We should report this to somebody\" said Mr.nTweedy. 2 Hoursnlater… \"Nownthat's what I'm talking about\" said Mr. Tweedy as he looked atnwhat seemed to be a two story house with a sign outside that saidn\"Employment office\" printed on it. \"Yeah\" Mrs. Tweedynreplied, she was also looking at the house. \"Now I knew there hadnto be one decent place in town\" Mr. Tweedy said to her, \"Yeah itnlooks ok\" she answered. Just then they heard the sounds of policencar sirens coming up to the house. An officer got out of one of thencars with a megaphone. \"This is the police, come out with yournhands up!\" he said. At hearing that the Tweedys drove away, \"Ohnshoot! Go!\" said Mr. Tweedy. Back onnthe farm… \"Alright,nwhere are the keys?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked, Mr. Tweedy looked at her,n\"I don't know where the keys are\" he said to her. \"Oh, don'tneven try that!\" she answered \"No, seriously I don't want youndriving around in the car\" Mr. Tweedy replied. \"Remember ourndeal? You said I couldn't drive until I got my license renewed\"nMrs. Tweedy explained. Mr. Tweedy sighed \"I can't stand youndrivin' around town…look at you\" he said to her as he pullednthe keys out of his pocket and handed them to her. She walked away,nbut then Mr. Tweedy thought of something. \"Hey wait!\" he shoutednand went after her, \"Look be careful when you drive that thing andnmake sure…\" Mr. Tweedy stopped short to grab their 2 Dobermans byntheir collar \"C'mere\" he said to them. \"And make sure not tonpark it in the sun\" he continued, Mrs. Tweedy nodded \"Bye\" shensaid to them before closing the door. \"Hey, can you give us a callnand let us know what time you'll be back?\" Mr. Tweedy asked. \"Seenya later\" Mrs. Tweedy replied before driving off. Since they hadn'tnfound other job options, she chose this time to visit her oldernsister on the other side of town. The Tweedy's two Dobermans,nHoward and Dan looked at Mr. Tweedy with pleading eyes and whined asnif to say: \"When is she coming back?\" \"She'll be back\" saidnMr. Tweedy, the 2 dogs continued to whine, as if to say: \"This isngonna be so boring\". \"Hey, why are you puttin' me down? Why arenyou gonna put your owner down like that?\" Mr. Tweedy asked. Howardnand Dan barked at him as if to say: \"I'm sorry\" \"See? Nownthat's better, c'mon\" Mr. Tweedy said to them as he walked backnup to the house. MORE TOnCOME Wellnthat's chapter one the past few paragraphs are parodies of thenmovie \"Daddy daycare\" I cut out a few lines to make it shorter Inalso didn't want to watch the Daddy daycare tape in order to copynthe lines I left out. Chapter 2 will be posted soon. But please readnand review! Wallacenand Gromit and the other characters will be introduced in the othernchapters, this one just focused on what happened to the Tweedys afternthe chickens escaped the farm.[Chapter 3] Note: Here's chapter 2. Chapter 3 will be added soon. Hope you enjoy this and be sure to read and review. So far the search for another job wasn't going as well as the Tweedys thought. After having different job offer encounters they decided to give the search a rest and continue later in the week or so they thought. That night a change was made… as a result, it helped make things somewhat better. \"So…how's your sister doing?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, \"She's ok, she asked about you\" Mrs. Tweedy replied. \"And…?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, \"I agreed to keep confidential\" said Mrs. Tweedy. \"Ohhh, shoot! Why do you always do that to me?\" he answered, \"Let's just say, I have my reasons\" Mrs. Tweedy explained. \"And those reasons would be…?\" Mr. Tweedy continued, \"She wouldn't talk to me anymore and she'd hurt you with her bare hands\" Mrs. Tweedy answered. Mr. Tweedy gulped at the thought of it, he had met his wife's older sister several times and she had never been impressed with him like their parents and other relatives were. \"It could have been worse, you should have been at her wedding\" Mrs. Tweedy continued. Mr. Tweedy snickered \"What happened?\" he asked, the whole thing started to sound more appealing. Mrs. Tweedy moved closer to him and whispered. \"So how did that end?\" he asked, Mrs. Tweedy tried to control herself from laughing. \"Oh, it was nothing a couple rabies shots couldn't fix\" she explained. \"Don't paint me a picture, I've heard enough\" Mr. Tweedy said to her. \"Alright, you got me\" she said to him. \"Well…I'll see you, 'cause I am worn out\" he replied, he started to go upstairs but then he stopped. \"Are you comin'?\" he asked, \"I'll be there in a second\" said Mrs. Tweedy before her husband continued upstairs. She thought about how she mistreated him and blamed the whole chicken escape on him when it wasn't his fault at all. She sighed \"Now I feel so alone\" she said to herself, just then one of their Dobermans, Howard came from behind the armed chair and went straight to her as he barked. \"Howard!\" she said before he licked her face, \"What are you doing in here?\" she asked. His bother, Dan was out on the front porch standing guard as usual. Howard's ears drooped and he began to whine. \"I know, I know what am I doing here? I didn't give Mr. Tweedy a chance to explain himself did I?\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him. Howard shook his head with a growl, \"Do you think I did the right thing?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked. Howard barked and shook his head once more like he was trying say: \"Uh-uh\"(I think it's pronouned Naw-Aw). \"Ohh, Howard\" Mrs. Tweedy said him, she gave him a bit of a hug. \"It's almost as if you understand what I'm saying, what do you think I should do, huh?\" she continued. Howard began to wag his tail, but then Mrs. Tweedy noticed something wedged between his neck and his collar. \"What's this? My wedding ring?\" she continued, she tried to figure out \"How did Howard find it?\". She looked at the ring it had \"Straight from the heart\" engraved it, after looking at it a tear dripped from her eye. \"Oh, Howard… you are so right, what was I thinking?\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him. She got up from the sofa and headed up stairs \"How could I mistreat him?\" she asked herself. 30 minutes later… \"You feelin' ok?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, \"Well, yes… and no\" Mrs. Tweedy replied. \"What's on your mind?\" Mr. Tweedy asked once more, his wife sighed. \"I've been thinking and… I was wrong to mistreat you and you were right about those chickens being organized so…what I'm trying to say is…I'm sorry\" she replied. \"Wait, what was that?\" he asked, Mrs. Tweedy didn't try to resist this time. \"I said I was sorry…I should have never mistreated you, so I apologize\" she said to him. \"Anyway…I hope you can forgive me\" she continued, \"Well…ok I forgive you\" Mr. Tweedy said to her. \"Really? 'Cause I'm really, really sorry\" she answered \"Seriously? In that case…\" Mr. Tweedy stopped short and moved closer to her. \"Wait! What are you doing? I…\" Mrs. Tweedy dropped off her sentence. Mr. Tweedy began kissing her neck, \"Eep!\" she said in a meek voice. But after a few seconds she stopped trying to resist. \"Mm\" she purred, the feeling of being kissed made her feel very relaxed. Mr. Tweedy stopped, the kiss only lasted a few minutes. He didn't try to go for her lips since he didn't know how she might react. But now that he saw that kissing her neck relaxed her he would try to kiss her on the lips the second time around. \"You haven't done that to me in a long time\" said Mrs. Tweedy, \"Yeah, well if what you're saying is honest then…you deserve it\" Mr. Tweedy replied. Mrs. Tweedy let out a nervous sort of laugh, \"Ok, I've gone red, now\" she answered with another nervous laugh. It was true… she was blushing, it was a rare thing when she and her husband expressed affection towards each other since they had been frustrated with the chickens. The next day… \"Whatcha doin'?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, \"Keep it down, the show's about to start\" Mrs. Tweedy replied. \"What show?\" Mr. Tweedy answered \"Would ya just look?\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him. They were watching Howard and Dan from one of the front windows. The paperboy came on his bike as usual, \"Ok, ready for this?\" he said to the dogs. Howard and Dan were wagging their tails and panting with excitement. \"Alright…go for it!\" said the paperboy before he threw the newspaper, the 2 Dobermans took off running, Howard caught the paper this time. He went over to the paperboy's bike with his tail wagging the whole time. \"Nice one Howard\" said the paperboy who gave him a pat on the head, \"Good day\" he said before peddling off down the road. The 2 dogs went in the house, waiting for what would happen next. \"Uh... 2 questions why does Howard always catch the paper? And secondly…how come Dan can never get it?\" Mr. Tweedy ask as picked up the paper off the floor. \"I guess Dan is a more… athletically challenged\" Mrs. Tweedy replied, Dan whined at hearing this. \"What a wimp… I'm just kidding you old softy\" she said to him, Dan stood up on his hind legs and licked Mrs. Tweedy's face. Howard got jealous and whined, he gave Mrs. Tweedy a look as if to say: \"You don't love me anymore?\" \"Now that's pathetic…jealous of your own brother\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him. \"The breeder said they used to try to out do each other when they were pups\" Mr. Tweedy explained. \"How could I forget?\" Mrs. Tweedy replied, she looked at a photo of the dogs when they were puppies. In the photo Dan was yanking Howard's ears. (I don't know if the two Dobermans in chicken run were males or were brothers so I made them that way. I don't think they had names ether so I gave them some but by looking at how they behave with each other they could have been brothers) \"Oh, well…this is a shocker\" said Mr. Tweedy, \"What?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked. \"It says here, as of next Monday the city's going start charging a tax of $ 100 pounds for people who don't register their dogs with the county\" he explained. \"Yeah, well…at least we got ours registered\" Mrs. Tweedy replied, \"That's an understatement\" Mr. Tweedy said to her. \"Yeah…you're darn right\" she answered with a laugh, Mrs. Tweedy went through the paper trying to find the classified ads but instead she found something else \"What the..? She said to herself. It was a flyer for the 10th annual Yorktown dog show(I don't know if the town Wallace and Gromit live in has a name so I came up with one). \"Hey, Mr. Tweedy did you know about this?\" his wife asked, he didn't reply. \"Mr. Tweedy?\" she asked once more \"Hello?\" she continued, he still didn't reply. \"Hey!\" she shouted \"Huh? Hey what?\" he asked, he was so interested in the paper he wasn't paying attention to what she said. \"Oy…here, read it for yourself\" she said to him as she handed Mr. Tweedy the flyer. \"10th annual Yorktown dog show? How come we've never heard of this?\" he asked. \"I don't know, I mean we've been citizens here all our lives so…how could we not know?\" Mrs. Tweedy explained. \"Well, technically I lived in Liverpool for a year\" Mr. Tweedy answered. \"What does that have to do with…? Never mind…are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Mrs. Tweedy answered. \"Oh, yes… wait, what are we thinking?\" Mr. Tweedy replied. Mrs. Tweedy slapped her forehead (Think of the town meeting scene in Wallace and Gromit where Gromit did the same thing after Wallace said the best way to catch a big rabbit was to use a big trap). \"Look…listen carefully, if we enter that dog show and possibly win, we could pay off all our debts\" Mrs. Tweedy continued. \"Oh, I see but we're not residents of Yorktown\" Mr. Tweedy replied, \"It says here it doesn't matter, all residents of the tri-county are allowed to enter\" Mrs. Tweedy answered. \"That's good…\" said Mr. Tweedy, \"Ya hear that? You two are going to be in that dog show\" said Mrs. Tweedy \"Huh?\" Howard and Dan replied simultaneously (at the same time). \"Then, we better start training 'em\" Mr. Tweedy answered, \"Right…it's time to teach some old dogs a new trick\" said Mrs. Tweedy. At hearing this Howard and Dan whimpered and let their ears droop. \"You know, since this is going to be for residents in Yorktown and the tri-county area, we could have some serious competition\" Mr. Tweedy explained. \"Competition? Who'd be good enough to beat us?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked. In Yorktown…. Yorktown was an average small town that is a common site in the English countryside. It also was the home of a popular duo that ran a humane exterminating service. Gromit's alarm clock went off, it was the signal for the start of another ordinary day or so he thought. Gromit woke up he found the alarm clock that Wallace bought for him to be very annoying. \"Sheesh! He buys the worse gifts\" thought Gromit as hegot up and went downstairs. Just when he was about to enter the kitchen he heard the postman whistling outside. As soon as he was gone Gromit went to the front door and found the mail that had been dropped in the slot. About 30 minutes later Gromit's ears picked up the sound of the buzzer in Wallace's room \"Gromit! Old pal, I hope you're up because today I…\" Wallace was cut short when he got stuck as usual. \"Um…I think I'll need assistance\" he said to Gromit, he sighed and pulled the lever on the wall. Within a few seconds Wallace was out \"Oh thanks, lad\" he said before he took a bite out a slice of toast with jam on it. \"Cracking toast, Gromit…did any post come today?\" he asked, Gromit handed him the mail that came. \"Let's see what's here\" said Wallace as he sorted through the mail. \"Bill, bill, junk mail…hmm, you may be eligible to win a five day cruise\" Wallace said to himself while sorting the mail. Just then, Wallace and Gromit heard a thump outside. Wallace looked out the window and saw the paperboy peddling down the sidewalk. \"Looks like the paper's here would you mind… getting it?\" before he could finish his sentence Gromit got up to fetch the paper. He left it next to Wallace and sat back down, \"Well, would you look at that! Gromit, this is something you can participate in…the 10th annual Yorktown dog show\" Wallace said to him. Gromit sighed sadly, \"I know it isn't like winning the giant vegetable competition, but it's worth a try…right, lad?\" Wallace answered. Gromit nodded, \"And look it says here that dogs of all breeds are allowed to enter, that's perfect for a mongrel like you\" Wallace explained. Gromit's ears drooped, he looked at Wallace as if to say: \"Who are you calling a mongrel?\" \"Ohh, you are quite the actor\" said Wallace as he gave Gromit a pat on the head. MORE TO COME Well that's it for Chapter 2. The introduction of my original character Pilot the Border collie will be in the next chapter the scene with Mrs. Tweedy and Howard the Doberman is a parody from an episode of the1997 TV show \"101 Dalmatians: The animated series\". But please read and review! Thanks again![Chapter 4] Here's chapter 3.nAnd thanks again for all the reviews. This chapter contains parodiesnas well as the introduction of my character, Pilot the Border collie. NOTE: here's anlist of people who five the characters would be voiced by if this fannfic was a film. Howard the Dobermann(Voiced by Cedric the entertainer) Dan the Dobermann(Voiced by Steve Harvey) Pilot the Borderncollie (Voiced by Wanda Sykes) Relentless the Bloodnhound (Voiced by Larry the cable guy) Kip the foxhoundn(Voiced by Jennifer Hale) Skip the foxhoundn(Voiced by Tony Rock) A few blocks away innthe midtown area, there was a stray dog laying in a trash can thatnhad been knocked over. \"Oy…I feel like I got hit by a truck\"nthe dog said to herself as she got up. She had been living on thenstreets for several months, she didn't really mind the lifestylenbut she did want another home. She walked over to PC Mackintosh whondidn't seem interested in a stay dog walking up to him. \"Hey!nBeat it you mongrel!\" he said to the Border collie, the dog yelpednand ran away. Once she was out of his site she stopped to pant,n\"Could this get any worse?\" she asked herself. Just then annAmerican Bulldog was standing right in front of her. He didn't seemntoo happy having the Border collie on his turf, he began to growl.n\"Eek! L-look m-maybe we can talk this over a nice latte', what donsay?\" the collie stuttered. The Bulldog just ignored her, before hencould even try to bite her, the Border collie took off running again.nShe had her tail between her legs and was yelping. She stopped innfront of a coffee shop to rest \"Nothing's been easy today or evernfor that matter\" she said to herself. Meanwhile, something elsenwent on several miles away. \"Hey Ginge I…Ginger? Are you here?\"nRocky asked \"Boo!\" said a voice from behind him. Rocky screamed,nthe voice behind him started laughing it was Mac. \"I gotcha, Inthought you'd never notice me\" she said to Rocky, \"You scare mensometimes, Mac\" said Rocky. Mac laughed, \"Aye, but not as much asnthat!\" she answered as she pointed to the ceiling. \"What? Whatnare you talking about? There's nothing that could…\" beforenRocky could finish his sentence he heard two voices shout above him.n\"Dog pile!\" they shouted and landed on Rocky, \"AAH!\" Rockynyelled as he looked up. \"Ohh, you guys…ok I get the point, verynfunny now could you do me a favor?\" Rocky said to Nick and Fetcher. \"Sure Guv'…what?\"nNick asked, \"Would you mind getting off my back?\" said Rocky.n\"Oh, sorry\" said Fetcher as he and Nick got up, \"So Mac,nwhere's Ginger?\" Rocky asked. \"She's preening herself\" Macnanswered, \"Again?\" Rocky replied. \"Hey! We're out in the wildnnow, and this island has tons of fleas, unlike on the farm where itnwas a minor problem\" Mac explained. \"Yeah, I guess you'renright, I hate fleas and ticks and to think I thought only dogs andncats could get them\" said Rocky. \"Oh, no birds can get them…\"nMac stopped short she heard Nick and Fetcher laughing. \"And ratsntoo\" she added \"Um…\" Nick dropped his sentence and tried tonhide the embarrassed look in his eyes. He and Fetcher startednwhistling as if to cover up the embarrassment they felt. \"Aha! See?nWho's laughing now?\" Mac replied with a laugh as Nick and Fetchernleft the coop. \"Mac? Are you the reason your old owners in Scotlandnsold you?\" Rocky asked, trying to make a joke out of the question.n\"Very funny, are your feet as fast as your mouth?\" Mac replied,n\"No…why?\" Rocky answered. \"I'm just sayin' you betternwatch what you say or else I could have Nick and Fetcher dog pile onnyou, again\" Mac explained. \"Wait! You planned this didn't you?\"nsaid Rocky, \"Maybe I did and maybe I didn't\" Mac answered withna laugh before she went outside. She and the other chickens includingnGinger always got a laugh out of teasing Rocky, Fowler even put innhis two cents once in a while. \"What's up?\" Ginger asked, shenhad just gotten back from preening herself. \"Mac just played a jokenon me\" said Rocky, \"Oh really?\" Ginger replied she startednlaughing. \"You had something to do with this didn't you?\" Rockynasked. Ginger laughed, \"I don't know where you got that idea butnit won't get you very far\" she said to Rocky. \"Well, what's thatnsupposed to mean?\" he asked Ginger who went outside. Buntynsnickered and stood next to Rocky at the entrance of the coop. \"Facenit, Rock Ginger's one tough nut to crack, it didn't take me longnto figure that out\" said Bunty. \"Maybe you're right\" Rockynanswered, but then he thought about it. \"Hey wait a minute!\" hensaid, and went after Bunty. Meanwhile back in Yorktown, things werenlooking good for the stray Border collie or so she thought. \"Phew!nAt least I'm away from that monster dog\" she said to herself. Butnthen she heard a growl coming from behind her, \"Then again, maybennot\" she said. The dog snarled \"Yipe!\" said the Border collienbefore she took off running down the street. \"Man! I can'tnbelieve he found me…ok gotta find a diversion\" the collie said tonherself. Just then, she saw PC mackintosh standing in front of thenvitamin shop. \"Ooh! Perfect!\" said the Border collie, she stoppednrunning and started barking at PC. \"You crazy mongrel, get out ofnmy site!\" he said to her, the collie could see the Bulldog comingncloser and with that she ran off down the block. The Bulldog howeverncouldn't stop in time to keep from running into PC Mackintosh.n\"What the…?\" before PC could finish his sentence the Bulldogncrashed into him and knocked him down. The dog had seen the directionnthe collie fled, he was angry and wanted to follow her. He growlednbut it changed to a yelp when PC Mackintosh grabbed hold of hisnspiked collar. \"This'll get you hard time in the pound, fella\"nPC said to him as he dragged the Bulldog to the pound down thenstreet. A few minutes laternthe Border collie had once again stopped to rest. All this runningnhad made her very tired and she was panting heavily. \"Wow! I madenit, phew!\" she said as she took her left paw and wiped some sweatnoff her forehead. Just then she heard Wallace's voice \"C'monnGromit, we've got a job to do\" he said. They had gotten a call anfew minutes ago from Lady Tottington she asked Wallace and Gromit toncheck the rabbit traps they had set on the outskirts of town. \"Ohnno! Humans! Hide!\" thought the Border collie before Wallace couldnsee her she hid in a knocked over trash can across the street. \"Ok,nkeys, wallet and…\" Wallace stopped short when he realized thenkeys to the anti pesto van weren't in his pocket. \"Wait a minute…nwhere are the keys?\" he asked himself, Gromit sighed and went backninto the house to look for the car keys. \"Oh, thanks lad\" saidnWallace, just then he heard a loud clang. \"Huh?\" he said as henlooked at the trash can across the street, \"What could that be?\"nhe asked himself as he walked across the street. He removed the trashncan lid and saw the female Border collie, who was curled up in anball. She was shaking and whimpering, \"Oh, you poor dog…I didn'tnknow there was a stray dog on this street\" said Wallace. \"Gromit,nold pal c'mere and see what I've found\" Wallace called out,nGromit grabbed the keys off the dining room table and went to seenwhat Wallace was talking about. He came in the living room carryingnthe Border collie in his arms, she licked his cheek as a way ofnsaying: \"Thank you\". A short time later,nWallace and Gromit discovered that they had a real problem on theirnhands. \"The poor thing must have been wondering the streets forndays\" said Wallace as he looked at the Border collie who had justnfinish a bowlful of dog food, Gromit nodded in agreement. \"I meannlook at her, she's nothing but skin and bones\" Wallace added, hennoticed the dog's ribs were slightly showing, Gromit nodded oncenmore in agreement. \"But with a little help, she'll benbetter…that's why she's staying here tonight\" said Wallace.nGromit's eyes bucked, he looked at Wallace as if to say: \"Are younkidding!\" \"Oh, come now, lad…she needs a place to stay atnleast till we figure out what to do with her, Gromit sighed he had tonagree that the Border collie was in no condition to go back on thenstreets. Just then Wallace and Gromit were alerted by a buzzing noisencoming from the other room. \"Oh dear, we better get going\" saidnWallace, about 30 minutes later they stopped at the driveway ofnTottington hall. Lady Tottington stood out front waiting for them.n\"You're late\" she said to Wallace once he was out of the van.n\"Sorry, miss but we had another important situation on our hands\"nWallace explained. \"Important? What could be more important thennthis?\" Lady Tottington asked. Gromit pointed to the van, the femalenBorder collie had her head sticking out of the open window in thenfront seat of the van. \"Oh! You poor thing\" said Lady Tottingtonnwhen she went up to the dog, \"Where did you come from?\" she askednas she stroked the collie's soft black fur. \"We found hernwondering the streets, she was hiding in a trash can\" said Wallace.n\"Oh, you poor dog…look at you, you're nothing but skin andnbones\" said Lady Tottington who also noticed the collie's ribsnthat were slightly showing. \"I agree, she eatsnlike she hasn't had a descent meal in years\" Wallace explained.n\"I can't believe her owner would be so cruel, Border collies arensuch loyal dogs…I've always hated to see dogs wondering on thenstreets and they have no place to go\" Lady Tottington explained. \"Inhope you're not planning to take her to the pound\" she continuedn\"Oh no, we would dream of that... She's stayin' with us, atnleast till she gets better\" Wallace replied. \"Good, a dog likenher or Gromit doesn't deserve to be in the pound\" Lady Tottingtonnanswered. \"Having her around won't be such a problem if only wenknew what her name is\" said Wallace. Gromit pointed to the lightnturquoise colored leather collar that the collie was wearing. LadynTottington looked at the round silver tag that hung from it. \"Pilot\"nshe said, \"What? Oh, her name's Pilot\" said Wallace who alsonlooked at the tag. \"That's a nice name\" said Lady Tottingtonnwho smiled as she continued to stroke Pilot's soft fur. \"Whatnnationality do you suppose it is? I mean I've never heard of anyonenor anything with that name before\" Wallace answered (regardingnPilot's name). \"I think its American\" said Lady Tottington,n\"American, eh?\" said Wallace. \"Yes, I mean look atnthis number and address, it's certainly not from around here\"nLady Tottington explained. \"You're right…well would you look atnthat Gromit, we got ourselves a yank dog, eh lad?\" Wallace said tonhim, Gromit nodded. Pilot's tail began to wag, at least nownsomebody had recognized she wasn't from England. Her I.D. tag madenit obvious by what was on it which was this: Pilot (310)-404-1024 Santa Monica, CA \"Yes! Finally someonenhas recognized I'm not from around here!\" she thought. \"Younknow, I've heard stories about this, her owners must have been herenon holiday and dumped her when they had to leave\" said LadynTottington. \"Maybe\" Wallace replied, \"That's what happened tonyou, isn't that right, girl?\" Lady Tottington said to Pilot whonwagged her tail once more. \"That must have been what happened tonher, there's no doubt about it\" Lady Tottington continued, \"Aye,nthat's harsh\" Wallace said to her. \"Yes it is, but as long asnshe's with you I know she'll be alright\" she replied. \"Oh,nshe sure will…Gromit and I plan to do a fine job on her, rightnlad?\" Wallace answered. Gromit nodded in agreement, \"I'm surenyou will, all she needs is a bath and a few days to build up hernstrength and she'll be in good condition\" Lady Tottingtonnreplied. But then she just thought of something \"Uh…Wallace?\"nshe said \"Yes?\" he answered. \"I think you have another prioritynother then Pilot, right now\" said Lady Tottington. \"Oh right! Thenrabbit traps…c'mon Gromit\" Wallace answered, Pilot whimperednshe was out of the van but she wanted to follow them. Lady Tottingtonngrabbed hold of Pilot's collar, Lady Tottington laughed she couldnsee Pilot wanted to help and she admired that. \"I think you betternstay with me for now, girl\" she said to Pilot who sighed. 1 hour later… \"Well the traps werenpretty empty, although we did find 3 that happened to be occupied\"nsaid Wallace. He showed Lady Tottington his net which had 3 rabbitsnin it, one of them was gray, the second one was brown and the thirdnwas completely white. \"Well as long as they stay here, therenshouldn't be a problem with them messing with the farms down thenroad\" said Lady Tottington. \"Yes, but aren't most of the farmsnones that have livestock? I mean I've seen two chicken farms whennGromit and I went down there, once\" Wallace replied. \"You'renright, most of the farms down that road are livestock farms\" LadynTottington answered. She and Wallace along with Gromit and Pilot werenall looking at a small road in the distance. It connected with thenone Wallace and Gromit used to drive up to Tottington hall, only thenrest of the road went passed it and had a turn farther down that lednto the tri-county area where most of the farms were located includingnthe Tweedy's chicken farm. \"Well…I guess we better get going\"nsaid Wallace. \"I suppose so, thank you Wallace\" said LadynTottington \"Oh, think nothing of it, Gromit and I just look at itnas another job well done\" Wallace answered. \"Right Lad?\" hensaid to Gromit, but then he realized he wasn't there! \"Gromit?nWhere'd you go?\" Wallace asked. Just then, he and Lady Tottingtonnwere alerted by a loud \"beep\" coming from the anti-pesto van. Itnwas Gromit, who was waiting in the driver's seat, \"Looks likenhe's already got a head start without you\" Lady Tottington saidnwith a laugh. \"I guess he has…well, good bye\" said Wallace,n\"Wait! Uh…you mind if I ask you something?\" Lady Tottingtonnasked. \"Go ahead, what is it?\" Wallace replied, \"Did you plannto enter Gromit in the Yorktown dog show?\" she asked. \"Well,nyes…I've got the flyer right here\" said Wallace who showed itnto her. \"Interesting…did you happen to see who the list of judgesnare?\" Lady Tottington asked. \"Why, no I didn't…let's see PCnMackintosh and… you're one of the judges?\" Wallace asked, \"Yes\"nLady Tottington answered. \"Well that's grand… it wouldn't benmuch of an entertaining dog show without you, would it?\" saidnWallace \"Very funny…but no, I guess not\" Lady Tottingtonnreplied with a laugh. \"Well, I suppose I'll see you around, huhnWallace?\" she continued \"I suppose so\" he answered. \"Butnwait, before you go I want to give you something, wait here…\" shensaid to him and went in the house. A few minutes later… \"Just to save you thenhassle of mailing the flyer downtown, I happen to have a copy of thenYorktown dog show training manual\" said Lady Tottington. \"Itnlists all the standards and guidelines you'll need to follow, butnI'm sure that won't be a problem, will it?\" she added. \"Oh,nno problem at all, miss\" Wallace replied. Once again, they heardnanother \"beep\" from the van, this time Pilot barked at Wallacenand Lady Tottington. \"Sorry!\" Wallace called out to the two dogs,n\"I better go, they're starting to get restless\" he said to LadynTottington. \"Well thanks again for stopping by\" she said to himn\"Oh, it was no problem… you're welcome\" Wallace answered asnhe got into the van. \"So long Wallace, take good care of Pilot, younhear?\" Lady Tottington shouted to him. \"Will do, goodbye\" hencalled back, the last thing Lady Tottington heard after that was onenlast \"beep\" from the van before it was out of site as it gotnfarther down the road. She sighed, \"He's such a kind man\" shensaid to herself. 2 hours later… \"Well, another jobnwell done, eh lad?\" Wallace said to his dog. Gromit nodded, \"Nownto sit back to a nice slice of Wensleydale...\" before Wallace couldnfinish his sentence while he was looking the other way Pilot grabbednthe cracker he was holding. \"Hey!\" Wallace said to her, Pilotnbarked back and wagged her tail. \"Oh, you like it too huh?\"nWallace asked her, \"Well…\" he started to say but then he heardnPilot whimper and stare at him with sad eyes. He could see that shenhad been through a rough life on the streets and what she needed nownwas some human comfort. \"Alright one more, then…\" said Wallacenas he gave Pilot another cracker, \"Now then…c'mon ol' girl\"nsaid Wallace as he got up and went into the kitchen. Pilot barked innresponse, Gromit just looked at her and sighed. Not that he wasnjealous or anything but still he cared about his friendship withnWallace and to have another dog like Pilot come into the picture hadnto take some getting used to. \"See? Nothing a can of dog food can'tnfix, Gromit doesn't really care for the stuff…do you lad?\" saidnWallace. Gromit shook his head in reply, \"You poor thing, livin'non the streets and nearly starved to death\" Wallace said to Pilotnwith a sigh. \"That's rough\" he added. A few minutes later… \"Well, make yourselfnat home\" said Wallace as he led Pilot upstairs. She sniffed aroundnthe hallway, absorbing the different smells, most of them werenWallace and Gromit. \"Until I make necessary repairs in that othernroom, you'll stay with Gromit tonight\" Wallace explained.nGromit's eyes bucked, he had gotten used to Pilot but he andnWallace barely knew her and the fact Gromit had to share his roomnwith her, seemed shocking to him. \"Well, good night Pilot\" saidnWallace as he gave her a pat on the head. \"And Gromit ol' pal…nontricks\" Wallace said to him, Gromit whined and drooped his ears.n\"I'm just kidding, lad\" said Wallace who gave Gromit a rub onnthe head to reassure him. \"Good night Gromit\" said Wallace beforenhe closed the door, Pilot yawned and stretched out on the throw rugnthat was in the room. Gromit blinked when she yawned, he wasnsurprised at how sharp and white her teeth were since she was anfemale dog. But now that he thought about it she was a differentnbreed and the way her teeth looked was probably common for her type.nGromit went over to Pilot and nudged her with his nose, \"What?\"nshe said with a yawn. \"Don't worry I'm not planning to stealnyour human\" she continued, Gromit shook his head this wasn't whatnhe meant. He gave her a hug as if to say: \"You can stay here\"nPilot's tail wagged once more. She liked Gromit as a friend, henproved to be much nicer then the dogs she used to know back innAmerica. \"See ya tomorrow\" she said to Gromit before he flippednof the light. Pilot sighed, \"Well, at least you're in a classynjoint, it beats that trashcan on 3rd street\" she thoughtnbefore falling asleep. MORE TO COME Well that's chaptern3. Hope you liked it, Chapter 4 should be up by the weekend or nextnMonday. But please read and review, I know I might have said the Overnthe hedge parody was supposed to be in this chapter but look for itnin chapter 4. Until then I hope you've enjoyed this new installmentnof \"Every Dog Has Its Day\" The scene with Mac andnRocky talking is actually a parody from the move Balto. Thenline \"That'll get you hard time in the pound\" is from Ladynand the Tramp 2: Scamp's adventure.[Chapter 5] Here's chapter 4. This chapter contains a parody from the movie \"Over the hedge\" The next day started off like any other for Wallace and Gromit, with the exception of Pilot the Border collie. Gromit was woken up as usual by his alarm clock he sighed and shut it off. \"Sheesh! That's gotta be the most annoying thing in this house so far\" said Pilot as she woke up and stretched. Gromit nodded, he made up his bed seeing that Pilot yawned and went back to sleep he decided not to wake her up again. Gromit had slept later then usual, by the time he got downstairs he noticed Wallace was already up and ready for the day. \"Mourning, Gromit…Where's Pilot?\" Wallace said to him, Gromit's eyes pointed to the stairs. \"Oh, still asleep is she?\" said Wallace, Gromit nodded \"I'd probably be doing the same thing…sleeping out on the streets has got to be rough, don't you agree?\" Wallace explained. Gromit nodded once more. 1 hour later… It was 7:00 am, Pilot woke up once again and yawned. \"Well, I better go see what Gromit's up to\" she said to herself. Once she got downstairs she stopped in the door way of the dining room. She looked around the room, it looked very appealing at that moment she did another stretch. She noticed another doorway that led to the living room, she went over to it hoping to find Gromit. Pilot found him sitting on the couch knitting, she blinked her dark green eyes in surprise she had seen humans knit but had NEVER seen a dog do it. Seeing that Gromit was very occupied with his knitting she barked, he was quickly alerted by it too. She looked at him and slowly wagged her tail, Gromit pointed to the dining room table. Pilot walked over to it and noticed he left out a box of cornflakes and bowl for her. She sighed, \"Well…I guess I ain't go no choice\" she said quietly, on average Pilot never really ate cornflakes in the mourning. At her old home in California she was given regular kibble or canned food like other dogs, but in this case cornflakes wasn't so bad for a change. She didn't have a hard time holding a spoon in her paw, like Gromit, Pilot used her paws like a human used their hands. 2 hours later… It was ten minutes passed 9:00 am, Pilot was in the living room with Gromit, watching him knit. But at that very moment the two were alerted by a loud crash coming from upstairs. After the crash they heard a voice: \"Ow!\" it was Wallace, the two dogs decided to go upstairs and see what was wrong. Gromit opened the door and saw Wallace on the floor \"I'm ok…\" he said to Gromit. A light bulb that was in one of ceiling fixtures was loose, it fell and shattered once it hit the hard wood floor. Wallace was perfectly unharmed, despite the fact on the step ladder he lost his footing and he fell down. \"Well…I guess the room won't get fixed after all\" he said to the two dogs. Wallace let out a deep sigh he got up from the floor, thankfully when he fell he didn't hurt his back or anything else. \"I might have to get someone to come over and have a look\" he said to Gromit as he closed the door. Just then, he noticed Pilot who looked perfectly alright! \"Well, look at you, awake already…and you look even better too\" Wallace said to her. Pilot barked and wagged her tail as if to say: \"Thanks!\" \"Well, I better go change\" said Wallace. Gromit and Pilot heard his bedroom door open then it closed within a few seconds. Gromit gave Pilot a look as if to say: 'When are you gonna tell him you can talk?\" \"When am I gonna tell him? J-just wait…ok? I don't know you guys enough just yet…give me some time, Kay?\" Pilot answered. Gromit nodded \"Thanks, G\" Pilot said with a sigh, \"C'mon let's go\" she continued as they headed down stairs and out to the backyard. Meanwhile back on the Tweedy's farm, Howard the Doberman was getting more then he bargained for when he woke up. He yawned and stretched, his brother Dan was still asleep and snoring loudly. (If any of you have Chicken run on DVD or VHS here's a way to tell which Doberman is Howard and which is Dan. If you paused one of the close ups of the Tweedy's Dobermans like the scene where the chickens are building the plane for example, if you look closely at the dogs Howard is the one left he has a line going straight down on his upper lip. Dan is on the right his snout is round and Howard's snout is kind of a square shape, this just so no one gets confused). Howard looked over at his sleeping brother, the two dogs were allowed to sleep in the house. The only place they were allowed to sleep in the house was in the living room on the carpet or in their dog beds. Howard was alerted by a faint thump coming from upstairs, \"Huh?\" he said, \"Hmm…no, no Howard you know the rules, the bedroom is the forbidden zone\" he said quietly to himself. Just then he heard a creak, \"But then again…alright just this one time\" he said to himself and with that he got up and left. When he got upstairs he stopped at his owner's bedroom door, the floor slightly creaked beneath his left paw. He gulped \"C'mon Howard, you ain't no chicken\" he said to himself once more. He put his ear against the door and listened for any noise or movement. To his surprise, he heard nothing! \"Huh?\" he thought, he opened door and looked inside. \"What the…?\" he thought, they didn't hear him come in, \"Oh they're asleep\" thought Howard he started to leave, But then he turned around \"Or are they really…?\" he asked himself, he walked quietly over to the bed he could hear his owner's snoring. He easily recognized Mrs. Tweedy's since hers was lighter, \"Ok, I was right, phew!\" thought Howard. He left the room quietly, his owners didn't hear him at all. \"Well, good…besides its none of my business to know what they do behind closed doors…\" Howard said to himself. \"At least this was easier to take in then, that time they were makin' out…\" He continued. Howard shuddered at the thought of it, he remembered it all too well. (Flashback) It was a normal night, about a month before the chickens escaped. He and Dan were downstairs watching \"I love Lucy\". (It one of several shows that came on in the 1950s) Howard noticed that the Tweedys had been upstairs a long time, so he go up from where he was sitting and went upstairs without thinking of it being the forbidden zone. He looked through the key hole and saw his owners making out right there! What surprised him even more was Mrs. Tweedy was perfectly ok with it! She rarely did anything like this, although Howard and Dan did noticed whenever the Tweedys acted flirty around each other. Also, weather Howard and Dan knew it or not Ginger, and the other chickens noticed too, Nick and Fetcher hadgotten a few glances whenever the snuck into the house to get supplies for the chickens. One thing they all knew as well as any other animal was nether of them couldn't stomach the site of seeing humans kissing. Howard and Dan didn't know that Ginger and the other chickens along with Nick and Fetcher disliked the same subject if the two Dobermans knew, things might have been different between them and the chickens. Howard couldn't stay upstairs any longer, he went back down to the living room and told Dan what he saw. The two dogs wondered if the chickens also disliked certain types of human affection like they did, but as long as the dogs were told to chase them if they escaped their question would remain unanswered. (End of flash back) Howard did remember one time he liked Ginger! It was over a year ago when she first came to the farm, Ginger was still a pullet and Howard and Dan were still puppies. Howard liked playing with Ginger from the opposite side of the fence, but one day when Mrs. Tweedy caught him she didn't seem to like the idea of the dog being friends with a chicken. To Howard and Dan it was heartbreaking for them end their friendship with Ginger and the other chickens. The day their friendship with the chickens ended, the Tweedys had started training them to hate and chase chickens if any of them tried to escape. During all the times the two dogs chased and attacked the chickens nether of them remembered that they used to be friends! But now that the chickens were gone the memory of the two dogs coexisting with them had come back to both Howard and Dan. Once it came back into his mind, Howard felt somewhat emotional, if only he and Dan could have a chance to apologize to Ginger and the other chickens for what they had done to them. \"One thing's for sure, they'll never know I was in their room\" Howard said to himself, regarding the fact he went in his owner's bed room. When he pulled the door closed with his right paw he accidentally slammed it! \"Oops!\" he thought hoping that the Tweedys didn't hear the door slam. \"Dang! They can sleep through anything\" said Howard who noticed there was an awkward type of silence after the doorslammed . He went back downstairs and laid down with his brother. \"And to think ol' blue eyes says I can see through anything\" Howard to himself with a snort. \"Yeah right\" he added with a yawn before going back to sleep. Later that mourning… \"Well, looks like somebody's gettin' in shape\" said Mr. Tweedy as he took the newspaper from Dan's mouth. \"What make you say that?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked, \"Dan caught the paper today\" Mr. Tweedy replied. \"Uh-oh, somebody's losing his touch\" Mrs. Tweedy said to Howard. \"Nah, I don't think it's that, he just…I don't know missed out I guess\" Mr. Tweedy answered. Mrs. Tweedy snickered \"Well, maybe he missed out because he spying in our room\" she explained. Howard gasped, he thought they didn't hear the door slam apparently Mrs. Tweedy did. \"Didn't I tell you both that the bedroom is off limits?\" she said to the two Dobermans who quickly nodded. Howard whined and let his ears droop when he lowed his head, \"Don't try it, I know that trick\" said Mrs. Tweedy. Howard whimpered once more and wagged his tail slowly, \"Oh, c'mon don't stay mad at him, cant' you see he's sorry? I mean he probably came up there to see what we were up to\" said Mr. Tweedy. Howard nodded in agreement, maybe Mr. Tweedy could convince his wife that Howard was innocent. \"True, but what reason would he have for coming upstairs?\" she asked, \"Maybe he just wanted to check to see if we were alright, I'm sure he didn't mean no harm, right Howard?\" Mr. Tweedy replied. At hearing this, Howard barked in agreement, \"See?\" Mr. Tweedy continued. \"Alright, I forgive you\" Mrs. Tweedy said to Howard as she gave him a pat on the head. \"Phew! Thank you Mr. Tweedy! At least I got someone to stick up for me when El Gato loses her self-control\" Howard said to Dan once they were alone, he nodded at his brother's commit. It was a rare thing when the Tweedys let their dogs off easy for doing something they shouldn't. Later that day… \"Well, I mailed off that flyer, we should be getting that training manual soon\" Mrs. Tweedy explained as she closed the door behind her when she got back from going to the mailbox. \"How soon?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, \"It said allow 3 to 4 days for delivery\" she answered. \"Oh, ok\" he replied. Wednesday… \"Not today, boys\" the mailman said to Howard and Dan who were sitting out front. Thursday…. \"Not today, fellas\" the mailman said to the two dogs. Friday… \"Sorry, not today fellas, maybe tomorrow\" he said. Saturday… \"Oh, guys\" he said to the two Dobermans who got up. Their tails began to wag at the site of the envelope the mailman was holding. Howard took it from him and pushed the front door openand went inside with Dan close behind him. The mailman laughed once they closed the door \"Those Tweedy dogs\" he said to himself before he walked down the road to his truck. Meanwhile, inside the house Dan began to bark to alert his owners of what happened. \"Huh? What the heck is wrong with that dog?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked herself as she got up from her desk. The dog continued to bark but then he stopped after a few minutes. \"Stop it, Dan…Howard? What have you got there?\" she said to them as she took the envelope from Howard's mouth. She opened the envelope and found the training manual for the Yorktown dog show. \"Well, it finally came… fancy that\" she said to herself, Howard barked at her there was a bit of excitement in his tone of voice. \"Good dogs\" Mrs. Tweedy said to them and rubbed the two Dobermans behind their ears. Both dogs were panting with excitement \"What's with all the barking?\" Mr. Tweedy asked as he came downstairs. \"The training manual came today\" Mrs. Tweedy explained, \"Oh, there's over 100 pages in this book\" Mr. Tweedy answered as he flipped through the training manual. \"Its no problem, the dog show's in 3 weeks… we've got time, from now until the dog showwe're going to be spending all of our weekends, training\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him. \"Not weekdays?\" he asked \"Especially weekdays\" she answered, \"So 7 days a week, huh?\" said Mr. Tweedy. \"Yeah, pretty much\" said Mrs. Tweedy, \"So when should we start training?\" Mr. Tweedy asked once more, \"Well, it says here if our dogs are purebred, we need to see if they match their breed's standard then we go from there\" Mrs. Tweedy explained. \"Oh, I see…uh, there's 4 parts in the dog show…you do realize that, right?\" Mr. Tweedy replied. He was right, the Yorktown dog show consisted of 4 different events including: A dog's ability to follow training commands, agility, showing the dog (like at AKC dogshows) and the last event was a race. \"Sure I do, once we get through going over the breed standard I'd say Howard and Dan can start training, oh say…next Saturday afternoon\" Mrs. Tweedy answered. The two dogs groaned at hearing this, \"Ohhh, there goes our I love Lucy marathon\" Howard said to himself, he and Dan had been looking forward the \"I love Lucy\" TV marathon all week and now that they would start training next Saturday they were sure to miss it. Back in Yorktown… \"Well, lad this book seems pretty simple, we should be ready for that show in no time\" said Wallace who was looking through the training manual. Gromit nodded, Wallace turned to the next page that contained the last chapter. \"Entry requirements… to enter the Yorktown dog show one of the most important requirement is… oh dear\" Wallace stopped short. Gromit looked up, \"Gromit I think we have a problem, it says here that one of the entry requirements is there must be two dogs on the application form and we've onlygot one\" Wallace explained. Gromit sighed sadly, but then he had an idea he looked outside and saw Pilot out in the backyard. \"I'm so sorry Gromit\" Wallace said with a sigh, \"If only we could find another dog\" he continued. Gromit pointed to the widow but Wallace didn't pay much attention \"Not now lad, we'll go for a walk later\" said Wallace. Gromit shook his head and pointed once more, \"Gromit, I told you we'll go for a walk later\" Wallace said in a firm tone. Gromit sighed and grabbed Wallace by the hand. \"Where are you taking me? Now see here I don't know what you want me to see but…\" Wallace dropped off his sentence as he looked outside. He saw Pilot sitting out in the yard watchinga flock ofsparrows land and take off on the brick wall that divided the yard from the neighbor's. \"Pilot! That's it! We do have an extra dog! Yahoo!\" Wallace said cheerfully before he went back into the dining room. \"I wonder what he'd do with out me?\" thought Gromit. Back on the farm… \"Dan?\" Howard asked, \"Yeah, bro what's up?\" Dan replied, \"I've been thinking… you remember when we used to be friends with those chickens?\" Howard continued. He and Dan were outside which was the perfect place for them to talk since the Tweedys didn't know they could talk, they were going to tell them but not right now. \"Uh-huh, why?\" said Dan, \"Well, now that they're gone I kinda miss 'em\" said Howard \"So, what else is new?\" Dan answered. \"So, I was thinkin' if we're gonna be in that dog show, maybe we should go find those chickens and see if they wanna come to the dog show and cheer us on!\" Howard explained. \"Howard, bro... I've known you all my life and you have come up with some crazy ideas and… this has got to be… THE MOST CRAZY IDEA YOU EVER CAME UP WITH!\" Dan shouted. \"So?' Howard answered \"So, how would we find those chickens anyway! They could miles away from here\" said Dan. \"Maybe, but I'm gonna go find 'em and if youwon't come then that's fine with me\" said Howard. \"Mrs. Tweedy's gonna be mad\" Dan said to him \"Only if she finds out and she won't 'cause I won't be gone long but until then I need you to cover for me, deal?\" he replied. \"Deal\" Dan answered, just then he heard the gate to the chicken yard open. \"But Howard how are you ever gonna find them? I mean we ain't got no lead\" said Dan \"Oh yes we do!\" Howard replied as he entered one of the coops. He found some of Ginger's feathers that were left from molting season and began sniffing them. \"Well?\" Dan asked, Howard walked out of the coop and sniffed the air. \"I got 'em!\" he said \"See ya!\" he said to his brother \"Be careful, bro!\" Dan called out to him, \"Don't worry I will!\" Howard called back as he ran. A few minutes later he was out in an open field, there was a lot of tall green grass and few trees scattered here and there. \"C'mon c'mon\" Howard said to himself, he stood in the field hoping to continue flowing the chicken scent. There was breeze in the air, he sniffed the air blowing in face and quickly regained the scent. \"Yes! Chickens here I come!\" he said and started to run again. After running for some time he stopped to pant at the edge of the lake. When he caught his breath, Howard took a drink of lake water. Once he was finished he continued on his search. \"Ok, the scent ends here so that must mean…\" he stopped short and looked out at the water, he saw an island a short distance away. \"They're out on that island\" he concluded \"Ok, here I go\" he said to himself, took a few steps backward and began to count. \"One…two… three… go!\" he said before he took off running. He jumped in the water which created a huge splash, he came up to the surface within a few seconds. Howard slightly coughed when the water entered his mouth as he came up, \"Ok this water's way too cold\" he thought before he began dog paddling. 30 minutes later… \"Phew! I made it\" he said to himself as he got out of the water and onto the bank. He stood there and shook himself, it would be a few minutes before his fur completely dried off. \"Now to find Ginger\" he thought as he started to walk up the bank. Once he got through the bushes and around the small trees he found a clearing with several chicken coops in it. \"Whoa! They really got themselves established\" he thought \"Ooh! There's Ginger!\" he said to himself and started to walk towards the clearing. \"So anyway I was saying…\" Ginger was cut off when she and Rocky heard a chicken shout \"Dog!\" the others started screaming and running. \"Wait! Wait! Wait! Hold it! Please!\" Howard shouted to them, \"Guys, shut up!\" Ginger yelled to the chickens. At that moment every one stopped, \"Now wait a second\" she said calmly and went up to Howard who sitting down on the grass. \"What are you doing here?\" Ginger asked, she knew Howard and Dan could talk since the last time she spoke to them was whenthey were puppies. \"I came here looking for you\" Howard explained, \"How did you find us? Did the farmers send you? And where's your brother?\" Ginger asked. \"Hold it, one at a time\" said Howard, \"First off, I found some of your feathers and followed your scent here… second, no, the farmers didn't send me…heck they don't even know I'm gone!\" said Howard. \"Really? But where's your brother\" Ginger asked. \"At home, covering for me…I hope\" said Howard, who hoped the Tweedys hadn't noticed his sudden disappearance. \"Look if you're here to think about eating us then…\" Howard cut Ginger off \"Relax I ain't gonna eat you, Ginger\" he said. She gasped, \"You remember my name?\" Ginger asked in surprise. \"Yeah, I know all of ya'll by name, that's Bunty, there's Babs and that's Rocky\" Howard explained as he pointed out the chickens he knew. \"Do you remember me?\" Fowler asked, \"Sure I do…lunch!\" Howard replied. All the chickens started laughing, except Fowler. \"How dare you!\" he yelled to the Doberman, Howard laughed \"I'm just kiddin' Fowler\" he said to him. \"So what brings you hear?\" Ginger asked, \"Well I…\" Mac cut Howard off, \"Hey! Did you forget me?\" she asked him. \"And what about us?\" said Nick and Fetcher, Howard laughed \"Sorry Mac… hey Nick, hey Fetcher\" said Howard. \"You know about us?\" Fetcher asked, \"Hey, me and my brother Dan have seen you sneak around the house once or twice\" Howard explained, \"But don't worry, you can trust ol' Howard me and Dan would never squeal on you\" he continued. \"Oh thanks, Mate\" said Nick who wiped off some sweat from his forehead. \"Anyway, what are you doing here?\" Ginger asked once more. \"I was here to look for you and I came to tell you something\" Howard said to her. \"Well, what?\" Ginger answered, \"First, I just want to say to all of you that Dan and I feel kinda hurt about chasing and attacking all of you\" Howard explained. \"Then, why didn't you tell us before?\" Ginger asked. \"We forgot we used to be friends with you and second those nutcase farmers trained us to hate you to no end\" Howard replied. \"Oh, now what was that other thing you wanted to tell us?\" she said to him. \"Well, I wanted to tell you that Dan and I are gonna be in the annual Yorktown dog show!\"said Howard. At hear this, all the chickens started cheering. \"So, what does that have to do with us?\" Ginger asked. \"Well, I kinda wanted to know if guys wouldn't mind….I mean would you guys like to come cheer us on?\" Howard replied. \"Yeah! That'd be great, right guys!\" Ginger asked, All the chickens just looked at her they didn't seem to be interested since the only answer Ginger got back was an \"Uh…\" from all of them. \"Oh, come' on you guys, it's the least we could do\" Ginger said to them. \"Well, I'm up for it\" said Rocky \"Me too\" said Mac, \"And so are we\" said Nick. \"We'll be right behind you, Ginger\" said Bunty, \"So Ya'll goin'?\" Howard asked. \"We're going\" said Ginger, \"Cool! C'mon let's go!\" said Rocky. Later… Once everything was settled Ginger had go over a few things with the hens that were staying. \"Ok, Agnes I'm leaving you in charge, understand?\" said Ginger \"Perfectly\" said Agnes. A few minutes later, Howard and the chickens that were going back to the farm with him were ready to leave. \"Bye, guys\" Ginger said to the other hens who all replied with various goodbyes. \"They're soup meat\" a black colored hen in a green scarf said to herself. She as well as the other chickens hoped the Tweedys wouldn't find their new home since the chickens had worked so hard to gain their freedom from their abusive owners. \"Hurry back!\" a brown colored hen shouted to Ginger and the others going with her. The chickens that went with Ginger and Howard were: Babs, Bunty, Mac and Fowler, Nick and Fetcher also joined in the group that was traveling back. Later that day… It was around 4:00 pm, when they reached the farm, Howard told them to stay hidden until he told them it was ok to come out. \"Dan! I'm back\" said Howard, \"Oh, good you're back\" Dan replied. \"Did Mrs. Tweedy notice I was gone?\" Howard asked his brother, \"No, she hasn't even been out here\" he answered. \"Phew! Thanks man, I owe you one\" said Howard as he went back to where the chickens were hiding. \"Yeah! You definitely owe me one! 4 pig ears and a jerky stick is what you owe, bro\" Dan replied. \"Ok, you guys go on in, alright?\" Howard said to Ginger, \"How do you know the farmers won't see us?\" Ginger asked. \"Look, just keep quiet and they'll never know you're here\" Howard explained, \"Ok\" said Ginger \"Good\" he answered. \"Whoo! Dan, my feet are killin' me!\" said Howard, his paw pads were slightly sore from all the running and walking he did while he was gone. \"Well, you have been gone almost an hour\" Dan replied, \"Hey! Don't push it\" Howard said to him \"Sorry, Bro\" he answered. 30 minutes later… \"Well, this really brings back memories\" said Rocky as he entered one of the coops and looked around. \"Ye-Yeah it sure does\" Ginger stuttered, Rocky was unaware that his tail feathers accidentally rubbed up against Ginger's face and she was about to sneeze! \"Don't sneeze!\" Babs shouted to her, the minute after Babs said that Ginger let out a loud sneeze. \"Uh-oh\" said Fetcher before he and Nick hid under one of the loose floor boards in the coop. \"What was that?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked herself, she and Mr. Tweedy had gone outside to check on Howard and Dan, but now they were alerted by a sound coming from the chicken yard (the sound was Ginger's sneeze). Howard sat next to the gate and watched Mrs. Tweedy open it, since the chickens were gone she had taken the lock off of it. But now she was focused on the sound that came from the yard, \"Oh…no\" thought Howard. He gulped at the thought of what might happen, Mrs. Tweedy opened the roof to the coop Ginger and the others were in. Although they didn't have time to hide, before the Tweedys entered the yard. \"Well, well well…look who's come back\" Mrs. Tweedy said to the chickens, now that they were back she had some ideas on what to do with them. But Howard wouldn't allow it, he went up to the Tweedys and started growling at them. Mrs. Tweedy gasped, she couldn't believe that he was trying to protect the chickens! \"Howard, heel\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him. Howard didn't listen he just growled deeper in his throat. \"Howard…I said, heel!\" Mrs. Tweedy said to the dog once more. Howard continued to ignore her, he snarled at both of the Tweedys and even snapped at them. He DIDN'T bite them he just snapped his teeth at them as a warning. \"Hmph! Fine, see if I care about them\" said Mrs. Tweedy before she and her husband left the yard. Once they were gone Rocky and the other chickens came out of the coop. \"Wow, Howard you got guts\" he said, \"Darn right you do, why back in my day if a dog turned on its owner it got severely punished\" said Fowler. \"Yeah, well…ever since I was a pup Mrs. Tweedy always said I'm her favorite so… she'll sometimes let me slide by\" Howard explained. \"Well, it's a good thing she let you slide by this time\" said Ginger \"You got that right\" Howard replied. 2 hours later… It was 6:00 pm and the sun had started to go down, it was still March and daylight savings time hadn't started yet. But it was coming since the days were beginning to get longer since the sun had started to set slightly later then usual. Ginger had told Howard and Dan what had happened once they escaped, and the two dogs told her and everyone else what happened on the farm after the escape. But their conversion was stopped short, \"Guys I hate to break up your little reunion but we got us a bigger problem\" said Dan. \"What?\" Ginger asked \"Human!\" Howard shouted, at that moment the chickens along with the rats Nick and Fetcher ran off. Mrs. Tweedy walked up to the gate and put the lock back on it, Howard and Dan growled at her they knew what she was doing. \"Don't even think about it\" she said to them, the two Dobermans let their ears droop. They now realized how cruel their owners really were and thought about how they didn't respect the chickens at all. When she got back in the house the chickens came out of hiding, \"Oh no it's locked\" said Rocky who looked at the gate. \"Puh-lease, they haven't made a lock that can keep in yours truly\" Ginger said to him with a laugh. Meanwhile, an hour later back in Yorktown Wallace and Gromit were both in the living room when suddenly Wallace noticed Pilot wasn't in the room with them. \"Gromit? Where's Pilot?\" Wallace asked his voice sounded a little concerned. Gromit pointed to the dog door, \"Oh, out for a walk, eh?\" said Wallace. Gromit nodded, \"That's perfectly ok…just let me know when she gets back, if you need me I'll be down in the basement\" Wallace continued before he got up and left the room. Gromit could hear him whistling in the distance, he sighed and went back to his knitting. Outside, Pilot was somewhat far away from Wallace and Gromit's house. She was walking on the street, she wasn't in any danger of getting hit by a car since no one was around but she listened out for anyone that was driving in her direction. Pilot sniffed the air, being out on a night like this particular one felt good to her. \"Alright, now to see about that road Tottington mentioned\" she said to herself. She passed Tottington hall and went down the road that led to the farms. Pilot had been walking for some time now, she looked around and saw she was in a cow pasture. \"Wow! There are so many stars out here\" she said to herself when she looked up at the night sky. \"Please, you've seen one night sky you've seen 'em all\" said a Holstein cow. \"Yeah, yeah yeah… she'll be milkin' her behind off, watch\" Pilot muttered to herself as she walked away. Pilot walked down a road which headed in the direction of the Tweedy's farm. She stopped and sniffed the air, \"Hey…\" she said and sniffed once more. \"Hmm… smells like chicken\" she added as she followed the direction of the scent. \"Dang, this farm has lost some its luster\" she said to herself as she entered the Tweedy's farm. \"Hey, you!\" Rocky called out \"Me?\" Pilot answered, \"Yeah you, listen can you help us? We're locked in\" Rocky explained. Pilot looked at the gate she could see it was securely locked, \"Can't you unlock yourself?\" she asked Rocky. \"We tried that but it's too difficult\" said Ginger, Pilot felt sorry for her and instead of walking away she decided to help. \"I'm so sorry, how can help?\" she asked, Rocky explained the whole thing to her but in order to pull off the plan they needed some supplies which required Nick and Fetcher to sneak into the house. They came back a few minutes later with some black eye shadow and a brush. Even though Pilot had a bath earlier that week Rocky decide to make her look more appealing by brushing her fur and making it look more black and glossy. Once Ginger and Rocky were done brushing Pilot and adding the eye shadow they decided it was time to give her a test run. \"Ok gorgeous you're on\" said Rocky as he shoved Pilot forward, \"Man, this better be one stupid human\" she said. \"Audio, go!\" said Rocky, Nick and Fetcher had also got a record player and record with various recordings of animal noises. But when they played it instead of a dog barking when it played, it was a cow mooing! Pilot looked back in surprise. \"She's supposed to be a dog, put it on dog! Maybe the human liked the cow let's hope the human liked the cow\" said Rocky. \"Who goes there!\" said Mr. Tweedy \"You're a dog! You're a dog!\" Rocky called out quietly to Pilot. \"You're a dog!\" she said to Mr. Tweedy, Rocky just slapped himself in frustration. \"Uh, I-I mean I'm a dog uh…woof-woof?\" said Pilot who frowned, Mr. Tweedy wasn't the least bit effected by hearing the dog talk. \"Yeah…right, shoo bye-bye get away from here we don't give out scraps to common strays\" he said. \"Common strays? Alright you asked for it\" said Pilot, she was about to growl. \"Get the key-ring!\" Rocky whispered, \"Gee that's a nice key-ring you got there, mind if I have a look?\" Pilot asked. \"No, no, no no! I must not be so near a creature of the outdoor woods\" Mrs. Tweedy said with a fake sneeze. \"Away with your filth!\" she continued, \"My filth?\" Pilot asked, the chickens gasped at hearing her tone of voice. \"My filth!\" Pilot continued she sounded angrier this time \"Aw, jeepers here we go\" said Mac. \"Ok, that's it I am sick and tired of everybody taking one look at me and runnin' away 'cause they think I'm filthy, well I got news for you I didn't get all trimmed and clean to have some overfed, pompous puffball tell me he's too good for me. I got make up on my butt dude! And you don't even wanna know about the cork!\" said Pilot. \"Stop! No one has ever spoken to me like that!\" said Mr. Tweedy, Ginger and the others gasped. \"It is bold… I like it\" said Mr. Tweedy, Ginger and Rocky looked at each other with frowns on their faces. \"Well, believe me Th-there's plenty more where came from…puffball\" Pilot said to Mr. Tweedy. MORE TO COME Sorry this chapter was so long. But there you have it a parody from over the hedge . Chapter 5 will be up sometime next week, until then this is it. But please do read and review.[Chapter 6] Sorry for the long wait on the update. I had a few other priorities to deal with at the moment but now I'm back. Here's chapter 5 hope you like it, so far it seem this fan fic is doing well. It had been over a week since the Tweedys had gotten the training manual in the mail. But this particular Saturday was going to be totally different then any other weekend the dogs and chickens had experienced on the farm. It was around 7:00 am on Saturday, everyone had different reasons for liking the weekend but one thing they all agreed on was sleeping in on Saturday mourning. So far on this particular mourning everything was going well or so it seemed. \"Huh? What!\" Mrs. Tweedy stuttered she had been woken up by her alarm clock. Like Gromit, she found the clock to be very annoying once sheturned it off she groaned at the thought of it being Saturday mourning and it was also the day she and Mr. Tweedy had to start training their dogs. Mr. Tweedy yawned \"You awake?\" he asked \"Yeah I'm awake\" Mrs. Tweedy answered with a sigh. \"Listen, do me a favor and remind me to send that alarm clock back to your brother…Sheesh! He buys the cheapest anniversary gifts\" she continued. Mr. Tweedy didn't comment on it, \"Well, we be better start training, c'mon\" said Mr. Tweedy as he got up. \"Oh great training day, let's go…in 10 more minutes\" Mrs. Tweedy said to herself, she was still tired and instead of getting up she went back to sleep. (I got the lines from the movie Madagascar) Later that day… Although Mrs. Tweedy didn't sleep for long, she was woken up by something that was licking her face. \"Ok, alright I'm up I'm up just…cut me a break already, sheesh!\" she said to Howard. \"Howard got you up didn't he?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, he was standing in the doorway of the room. \"Yes he did\" Mrs. Tweedy replied with a sigh, \"Ok I'll get up\" she continued and yawned. Back in Yorktown… \"C'mon Gromit wake up\" said Wallace, Gromit slowly opened his eyes and yawned. The alarm clock he usually had on was unplugged since it got his last nerve as well as Pilot's. \"It's Saturday\" Pilot answered in a drowsy tone, she had revealed last week that she could talk so Wallace wasn't the least bit startled as he was the first time. \"I know, But its training day\" Wallace explained. \"Training! Uh… we can't Gromit and I caught a cold while we were sleeping\" Pilot replied with a fake sneeze. \"You'll be fine\" Wallace said to her as he opened the window. \"We're gonna train like champions\" he said to the two dogs, who fainted. (I got the lines from the movie Stuart Little 2) Back on the farm… \"It says here other then the vegetable competition this fall, the dog show is the second town highlight… Heh, who knew?\" said Mr. Tweedy as he finished reading the newspaper. He didn't hear a reply from his wife at all, just silence \"Mrs. Tweedy?\" he asked. Still no reply, \"Mel?\" he asked once more, finally he let out a loud whistle. \"Huh? What?\" Mrs. Tweedy answered she had sort of dosed off when she was sitting at her desk. \"Now see, typically I'm the one who falls asleep when you're talking but today…\" Mr. Tweedy stopped to laugh. \"It was reversed\" he continued, \"Give me a break, I didn't sleep too well last night\" Mrs. Tweedy replied. Just then she was alerted by a loud snort \"Yikes!\" she said and sort of jump up, \"And I guess Howard and Dan didn't ether\" she added as she looked at the two dogs who both looked almost as tired as she was. \"I don't know, Dan looks like he did well but you and Howard well…\" Mr. Tweedy stopped to laugh once more. \"Looks like you've been burning the midnight oil\" he continued, \"Hey, around here Howard and I are the brains and you and Dan are the brawn\" Mrs. Tweedy explained. \"You've got a point, brains and brawn you can't compete with that\" Mr. Tweedy answered. \"Darn right, I mean we had something going here with those chickens\" Mrs. Tweedy replied, \"What do you mean?\" Mr. Tweedy asked. \"I intimidate, Howard and Dan are the muscle and you retrieve the escaped ones, its been that way since they were 3 months old\" Mrs. Tweedy explained(I got those lines from the T.V. series The Proud family). \"Sure has been, but you've got something that the dogs and chickens don't have\" Mr. Tweedy answered. \"And what's that?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked, her husband moved closer to her \"Beauty and brains\" he said. Mrs. Tweedy had stiffened her laughter, \"Look, if you're trying to pull a move on me then its not working, well at least not right now\" she answered. She knew Mr. Tweedy was trying to make up for the two of them having a sort of love-hate relationship for the past year. She blushed and she already did feel somewhat submissive but she had other priorities she knew they had to deal with first. \"Maybe I can try again later?\" Mr. Tweedy asked. \"Don't push it\" Mrs. Tweedy answered in a firm tone, \"Nevermind\" said Mr. Tweedy. Later… \"Ok Howard stand still\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him as she measured him. Howard did as he was told and allowed her to measure his height, length and width. \"Alright you're done, good dog\" she said to Howard before giving him a dog biscuit. \"Dan\" she said to the other Doberman who looked up at hearing his name. \"It's your turn\" Mrs. Tweedy continued, Dan whined and shook his head. \"Dan, look its not going to hurt you\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him her voice sounded a bit calmer then usual. Dan barked at her angrily, \"Maybe he just doesn't want to be measured\" said Mr. Tweedy. \"Well, he has to be, otherwise we won't know if he matches the standard or not, now c'mon Dan\" Mrs. Tweedy continued. Dan just looked at her \"You better get over there before she knocks you into next week\" Howard said to him quietly. (What might happen if Dan didn't get measured) \"Where's Dan?\" Mr. Tweedy asked \"He wouldn't let me measure him so I knocked him into next week…don't worry he'll be back on Tuesday\" said Mrs. Tweedy. (Back to original scene) (I got those lines from the T.V. show everybody hates Chris) \"You better go before she…\" Dan cut Howard off \"Yeah, yeah yeah I know\" he answered quietly and sighed. He looked up at Mrs. Tweedy and whined, \"So, you ready now?\" she asked him Dan nodded. \"Alright, stay still\" she said to him as she began to measure his height. Within a few seconds Dan yawned at sat down,\"Dan!\" Mrs. Tweedy said to him she groaned \"You're supposed to stand up not sit down\" she said to him. Mrs. Tweedy knew she had to control herself, she sighed \"Alright…I'm- I'm not going to yell at you just… work with me here, ok?\" she said to Dan trying to remain calm. He nodded \"Great…\" Mrs. Tweedy replied. Later… \"Well, they both match the standard with the exception of their coat color which is ok 'cause it's rare\" Mrs. Tweedy explained. Howard and Dan were both purebred Dobermans since the colors that were considered common for their breed were: black and tan or chocolate and tan, Howard and Dan were both a sort of gray and beige. With dogs gray colored fur is classified as \" silver\" and the color of Howard and Dan's paws would ether be classified as \"yellow\" or \"blonde\" in their case their paws had a kind of yellow tone. \"Phew! So, now what do we have to do next?\" Mr. Tweedy asked, \"The hard part…training\" Mrs. Tweedy said him. Howard and Dan whined at hearing this. A few minutes later… \"Ok the book says the dog has to be given a trail on each segment, the first one is racing\" Mrs. Tweedy explained. The 4 of them were now outside, she whistled for the two dogs to come, they both came running to their owners, barking with excitement. \"All right then…go!\" Mrs. Tweedy told them, Howard and Dan just stood there doing nothing. Mrs. Tweedy walked over to the two dogs \"Now then, go!\" she said once more. The two dogs did nothing, there was a bit of silence between them and their owners. The only thing that could be heard right at moment was the 4 of them breathing and a cricket chirping somewhere on the farm. \"What is wrong with them?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked, \"Maybe they need a little motivation\" Mr. Tweedy said to her. Just then, he had an idea \"I got it! I'll be right back\" he said \"Wha? Wait! Where are you going!\" Mrs. Tweedy asked. \"Trust me\" Mr. Tweedy called back as he left. Minutes later… Since they didn't have anything better to do, Mrs. Tweedy sat and waited on the stoop with Howard and Dan laying near her feet. \"I'm back\" Mr. Tweedy said to her, \"Where were you? You were gone for a good 20 minutes\" Mrs. Tweedy replied as she put the T.V. guide magazine she was reading on the stoop. \"I went to get something\" Mr. Tweedy answered, \"What is it?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked him. Mr. Tweedy was holding a white chicken with a dark green bandanna with white polka dots around her neck. \"I barrowed her from the farm next door\" he said Mrs. Tweedy raised up one of her eyebrows in confusion. \"Huh?\" Howard and Dan said at the same time. \"How is she supposed to help?\" Mrs. Tweedy asked \"Well, I said maybe they need some motivation so…this is it\" Mr. Tweedy answered. \"I still don't get it\" Mrs. Tweedy replied \"Look, remember how the dogs chased after the chickens?\" Mr. Tweedy asked. \"Yeah, so…?\" Mrs. Tweedy answered, she stopped short, \"So…we've got a chicken they chase it and… you see what I'm trying to say here?\" Mr. Tweedy replied. \"Oh now I get what you're walking about\" Mrs. Tweedy answered, \"Got it?\" Mr. Tweedy asked \"Got it\" Mrs. Tweedy replied. \"Got it guys?\" she asked their two dogs, \"Uh…\" Howard and Dan answered in confusion. \"Never mind, well let's get this started\" said Mrs. Tweedy, the chicken Mr. Tweedy brought from next door gulped nervously. She was now on standing on the ground \"You better start running\" Mr. Tweedy said to her. \"Oy\" thought the chicken whose name was Gerta. \"Alright then, get set…\" Mrs. Tweedy started to say, Howard and Dan were ready to chase Gerta. Even though they had made up with mistreating the chickens they still liked to chase them even though they were friends again. The two dogs panted with excitement, both of them were wagging their tails. \"Go!\" Mrs. Tweedy told them, Howard and Dan took off running and barking. \"Yikes!\" Gerta said to herself before she began to run, she immediately began to pant within a few minutes. \"In old country Gerta never suffer like this\" she said to herself, Gerta had a thick Swedish accent. She yelled as the dogs came closer to her, they still were barking at her. Meanwhile in the chicken yard Ginger and the others were woken up by the noise. \"Huh? Wha?\" Ginger said as she woke up, \"Where's all that noise coming from?\" Rocky asked as he got up and rubbed his eyes \"Hey! What's with all the racket?\" Nick asked. \"I don't know…we better find out\" said Ginger, she and the other all went outside and saw what was going on. They heard Howard and Dan barking and Gerta clucking as the 3 of them ran by the fence. \"It's Gerta\" said Ginger, \"Who?\" Rocky asked \"Gerta, she's from the farm next door\" Ginger explained. \"What a doll… uh l-like you\" said Rocky who noticed Ginger looking at him angrily. \"Ginge I'm only kidding\" Rocky said to her \"O…Kay\" she replied, \"Where's Gerta from anyway?\" Rocky asked Ginger. \"Gerta is from Sweden\" she said to Rocky, \"They've got good chocolate there\" said Fetcher. \"That's Switzerland, Fetcher\" Ginger replied \"Darn it! How do you know about that stuff?\" Fetcher answered. \"Mac has a few world geography maps, she lets me read some of them\" Ginger explained. \"Oh I see, so what's the story on Gerta?\" Nick asked, \"Yeah how do you know her, Ginge?\" said Rocky. \"Well, Gerta is owned by people on the farm next door…so\" Rocky cut Ginger off. \"Sorry, but I don't see a farm next door\" he said \"And nether do I\" Nick answered. \"What I meant by next door was 3 miles next door\" Ginger said to them. \"Oh\" said Nick and Rocky at the same time, \"I get it, now go ahead about Gerta\" said Rocky. \"Well…\" (Flash back) \"I met Gerta when I was a pullet, I had been living on this farm for over 2 months\" Ginger explained. \"And how old was Gerta?\" Rocky asked, \"Gerta? She was 8 months old and I was two months younger then her\" Ginger answered. \"Interesting, so how'd you guys come across each other?\" Rocky replied. \"Her owners, the Medleys had to go back to Sweden for about a week and they couldn't take Gerta with them so… she stayed here with us\" Ginger explained. \"Oh, now wait wouldn't the rest of her flock needed to have stayed here too?\" Rocky asked. \"No, her flock wasn't even here yet, they were being shipped here…Gerta was the only the Medleys took with them because she was a bit timid and she was the only one in her flock that was raised by humans a few days after she was born\" Ginger explained. \"Oh, I see\" said Rocky, \"Her Humans already knew and spoke English but Gerta didn't, all she knew was Swedish language, so while she was here with us we taught her how to speak English\" said Ginger. \"Wow!\" Rocky replied, he found the whole thing a bit interesting. (This a conversation going on in the flash back) \"Hi there\" said Ginger, Gerta gulped nervously and slowly waved to Ginger. \"Its ok, I'm Ginger and your name is…?\" Ginger stopped short, \"Gerta\" said the other pullet. \"Nice to meet you, c'mon I'll show you where you'll be staying\" Ginger explained and started to walk away. Gerta just stood there, \"Gerta? C'mon\" said Ginger who turned around and noticed Gerta not following her. \"What's wrong Ginge?\" Frances asked \"This is Gerta, I think she's shy\" Ginger answered. Gerta shook her head, \"I guess not, does she speak English?\" Frances asked, \"I don't know\" said Ginger. \"Hmm, I think I've figured it out\" said Frances, she walked up to Gerta and starting speaking Swedish. Ginger stood there and listened she didn't know what they were saying since all she knew was English. \"What'd she say?\" Ginger asked, \"Gerta's from Sweden she doesn't know how to speak English but she wants to learn\" Frances explained. \"Great, let's go\" said Ginger as she led the other two chickens over to her coop. (Flash back ends) \"So that's pretty much what happened\" Ginger told Rocky, \"Interesting story\" he said to her. \"I've got more of 'em\" she said, \"I can only imagine\" said Rocky. Just then, Howard and Dan had stopped running and began to pant, Gerta had also stopped to pant. \"Not bad, 20 minutes and 38 seconds…alright take a break\" said Mrs. Tweedy \"Finally!\" Gerta said to herself, Mrs. Tweedy opened the gate Gerta sighed and went in. She heard the gate close behind her, and Mrs. Tweedy left with Howard and Dan walking beside her. \"Well, Gerta alone now\" the hen said to herself, the way she talked was referred to as broken English or poor English which was basically a primitive type of speech. \"Hey Gerta\" said a familiar voice \"Ginger!\" she answered and hugged her. \"I worry about you so much\" said Gerta who let go of Ginger, \"I was concerned about you too\" said Ginger. \"I miss you so much, where you been?\" Gerta replied, \"We escaped, we've been gone for over a month\" Ginger explained. \"If you escape why you come back?\" Gerta asked in her thick Swedish accent. \"The dog show in Yorktown is in 3 weeks\" Ginger answered, \"So you come to cheer on Howard und Dan?\" Gerta replied. \"Yeah we did\" Ginger said with a sigh. \"It's so nice to be here with you, old friend\" she continued, \"Yes\" said Gerta. Just then, she noticed Rocky \"Is he with you?\" she asked. \"Who, Rocky? Yes he's with us, why?\" Ginger replied, \"I see you find mate, huh Ginger?\" Gerta replied. \"Well…\" Ginger laughed \"I don't know we haven't gotten that far yet\" she continued. \"He like you, yes?\" Gerta asked \"Uh-huh\" Ginger answered, \"And you like him?\" Gerta answered. \"Yes\" said Ginger \"Then it shouldn't be long be you two… how you say? Get closer to each other?\" Gerta answered with a laugh. \"Gerta, knock it off\" Ginger said to her, \"Oh sure I knock it off, so Ginger do I hear wedding bells in the air?\" she answered and started laughing again. \"Oy\" Ginger said to herself, and with that Gerta walked away laughing. Back in Yorktown… \"Well, the book says the first thing you two need to do is a trial run, are you ready?\" said Wallace. Pilot sighed, \"As we'll ever be\" she answered before getting up from where she sat. A few minutes later she and Gromit were outside with Wallace, \"Alrighty then… ready…get set… go!\" he said to the two dogs who both took off running down the block. Minutes later…. \"Well I'll be doggoned, 18 minutes and 34 seconds not bad, well come on I think this calls for a break and a nice slice of Wensleydale\" he said to Gromit and Pilot as he walked towards the front door. Wallace looked back and noticed the two dogs weren't following him. \"Are you coming or not?\" he asked them, Pilot sighed and started walking towards the door Gromit rolled his eyes and followed her. Once they were all in the house, Gromit and Pilot were both worn out even though they hadn't been training for a long time. \"Shoot! This is hard work\" said Pilot, Gromit nodded \"I don't know how we'll pull this off, what do you think?\" she continued. Gromit gave her look as if to say: \"I don't know\" \"I don't know ether but…\" Pilot stopped to scratch her ear, \"Its worth a shot\" she concluded. Gromit nodded in agreement \"Well, we've got a lot of work ahead of us for the next 3 weeks but that shouldn't be hard, right?\" Wallace said to the two dogs who nodded. \"Oy, what do you think we'll have to do next? Push ups?\" said Pilot once she and Gromit were alone. Gromit just sighed he knew that the next 3 weeks weren't going to be easy for the two of them. \"Yeah, yeah I know…sheesh!\" Pilot replied. MORE TO COME… Sorry for the long delay part two should up in a week or so but until then please read and review.[Chapter 7] Note: Sorry for the long wait on the update, but anyway here's part two of training dayz. The next chapter won't be up for at least another week or two, I'm going to be out of town next weekend so I'll update the story once I get back. Thanks for reading! So far training for the Yorktown dog show proved to be hard work for both dogs and a chicken. \"Man, we've been workin' our behinds off, huh Dan?\" said Howard. \"Darn right bro, Gerta got a work out too\" Dan replied, \"I dunno if I like this dog training stuff but…if we lose our owners will be in the financial dog house\" Howard explained. \"Got that right, bro\" Dan answered. Meanwhile, in the house the dogs and chickens weren't the only ones who had a hard time adjusting to training for the show. \"Well, so far this dog training thing seems to be…going well\" said Mr. Tweedy \"Yeah, but there's still more to cover\" Mrs. Tweedy added. \"Well, the next 3 weeks will probably be a breeze\" Mr. Tweedy replied, \"Are you kidding? We haven't even gotten to the hard part yet\" Mrs. Tweedy explained. \"Oh brother\" Mr. Tweedy said to himself. Meanwhile outside, the first day of training had somewhat taken its toll on 2 dogs and a group of chickens. \"Can you believe that for the next 3 weeks we gotta train for this show and our humans are hoping for us not to lose?\" Howard asked. \"That's a lot of pressure\" said Ginger, \"Darn right it is, but this'll be an interesting moment for us\" Howard answered. \"Yeah\" Ginger replied, \"I remember when I was in the circus, I was there since I was a cockerel so I know how hard it is training\" Rocky explained. \"Ain't it hard? This'll be a moment for the album\" Howard added, \"Sure sounds like it\" Rocky replied. \"So, how are you guys gonna lick this training thing?\" Ginger asked, \"By trying our best, I mean you know who'll kill us for sure if we fail at winning that show\" Howard replied. Ginger paused for a moment but it didn't last long, \"Well I send best wishes to you\" she said to Howard. \"Thanks Ginge\" he said to her… (Ok if this was a real film there's song there'd be a song playing in this scene called \"That's all\" by Phil Collins) (Intro to \"That's all\" by Phil Collins playing in background) \"Well Dan here we go again\" said Howard, \"Yeah bro, let's go\" Dan answered. (Here's the lyrics to \"That's all\" basically during this scene it would go back and forth showing the Tweedys and Wallace and Gromit training for the dog show). \" Just as I thought it was goin' alright I found out how wrong when I thought I was right, it's always the same it's just a shame, that's all… I could say day and you'd say night, tell me it's black when I know that it's white, it's always the same it's just a shame, that's all.\" \" I could leave but I won't go, though my heart might tell me so, I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes…So why does it always seem to be, me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me, its always the same it's just a shame…that's all. I could say day and you'd say night, tell me it's black when I know that it's white, it's always the same it's just a shame that's all.\" \" Turnin' me on, turnin' me off makin' me feel like I want too much, leavin' with you is justa puttin' me though it all of the time. Runnin' around stayin' out all night, takin' it all stead of takin' one fight, livin' with you is justa puttin' me through it all of the time.\" \" I could leave but I won't go, it'd be easier I know…I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes…\" \" Why does it always seem to be, me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me it's always the same it's a just shame that's all. Just cause I love you, more then I wanted to…there's no point in trying to pretend. There's been no one who makes me feel like you do, say we'll be together til the end.\" \" I could leave but I won't go, it would be easier I know, I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes...\" \" So why does it always seem to be… me looking at you, you lookin' at me it's always the same it's just a shame… that's all, that's all.\" \" But I love you, more then I wanted to, there's no point in trying to pretend. There's no one who makes me feel like you do, say we'll be together til the end…\" \" But just as I thought it was goin' alright, I found out along when I thought I was right, it's always the same it's just a shame, that's all.\" \" Well I can say day and you'd say night, tell me it's black when I know that it's white, it's always the same it's just a shame that's all, that's all.\" (Music fades and eventually ends) (Well that's the song, I DON'T own the lyrics. But basically if this fan fic was a movie, this song would be playing in the background of the scene that shows The Tweedys and Wallace and Gromit training for the dog show, and now back to the story). 3 days before the dog show… \"Great job guys, you're ready for the real deal\" Mrs. Tweedy said to Howard and Dan as she petted the two Dobermans. She was impressed with how well they had improved over what seemed to be a short amount of time. \"There's no way we can lose\" Mr. Tweedy added. Back in Yorktown… \"Looks like you're both ready for the show, huh?\" Wallace said to Gromit and Pilot, who nodded. \"Well, c'mon you both get the next 2 days off\" Wallace continued before he started going into the house, \"Thank you\" Pilot answered with a sigh. \"Well, G we made it this far\" she said to Gromit, apparently \"G\" was Pilot's nickname for him. Gromit nodded in agreement, \"Well, let's go in…this ground is killin' my pads\" Pilot continued as she followed Gromit into the house. Her paw pads were sore from all the running they had done for the past 3 weeks and they really needed a rest. 2 days later… \"So I assume we'll all be going to that dog show, tomorrow\" said Fowler, \"Right, Fowler and our main goal is…\" Ginger stopped short. \"We know, we know\" said Bunty \"Try not to be seen\" the chickens answered simultaneously, \"That's right\" Ginger answered, just then she was alerted by some foot steps. \"Human!\" she shouted and with that the chickens scattered around the yard. \"Hmm\" Mrs. Tweedy thought as she looked through the fence, Howard growled at her. \"What?\" she asked, Howard replied with a sharp bark, \"Never mind\" she answered as she rolled her eyes and left. \"Ya'll better brace yourself tomorrow, the dog show starts at 10:00 am\" Howard reminded the chickens once Mrs. Tweedy had left. \"Don't worry, we've got it all under control\" said Rocky, \"Uh-huh, and I'll be the one dragging you out of trouble if something happens\" Ginger answered. At hearing this, the chickens and two dogs along with Nick and Fetcher began to laugh. \"Nothing gets past you does it, sister?\" Rocky asked, he was once again the center of embarrassment. Ginger just shook her head in response, \"Ay Chihuahua\" said Rocky before he walked away. MORE TO COME… Sorry if this chapter seemed so brief but that's it for the Training Dayz chapters. SPOILER WARNING: The next chapter \"It's show time\" is the beginning of the dog show and also where the Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit characters actually meet each other face to face!

The notebooks I used when I started writing Every dog has it's Day or Chicken Run Biography are in a box with my other writing related supplies. I moved and still have boxes I haven't unpacked, so those books are more than likely in a box out in the garage. For anyone wondering if I'll finish these stories, I will eventually but right now they're still on hiatus. Also, I can't reply to anonymous reviews, in order for writers to reply, the reviewer needs to have an account. And if anyone asks if the Tweedys have kids at the end of Every Dog Has It's Day, Sorry to disappoint those who were hoping for that but that's not what I planned when I developed the storyline. But I did come up with happy endings for both Chicken Run Biography and Every Dog Has Its Day. So, no worries. I appreciate that people are still reading, reviewing and adding these stories to their favorites' lists. Thank you. I've got other stories and projects that I'd like to work on before coming back to these. I've also been in a bit of a rut too which makes it hard for me.

Ginger, an orange, slim chicken, scuttled across Chikin Park, watching Bunty play joyfully with her 8 kids and Babs knit a new hat for her new-born child, Stabs. Ginger did think this was an inappropriate name for a child, but she knew Babs was pretty wacky, so she didn't argue with her decision. \"Ey there hen!\" Two huge glass eyes appeared in front of Ganger. \"Hi, Mac!\" Ginger said, attempting to sound happy. \"En - what's troublin yer?\" Mac asked. She sees right through me! Ginger thought.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Chicks Goes Missing! The sun rose early in the morning in Chikin Park, and Rocky and Ginger were still sitting atop the hill, staring into the distance. \"Oh, Rocky,\" Ginger said. \"Oh, Ginger,\" said Rocky. \"Oh, Rocky. I am so glad-\" Ginger was interrupted by a blood-curdling scream coming from Chikin Park. \"Oh my God, Rocky, did you hear that?\" Ginger asked, nervously. \"It was hard not to hear, doll-face,\" Rocky replied. \"Let's motor!\" They ran down the hill and came to a disgraced Babs sitting on her porch. \"Babs! What's wrong?\" a concerned Ginger asked. \"It's-it's-\" Babs couldn't finish. She let out another wail. Suddenly a dazed Bunty came from her house. She had tears running down her face. \"Bunty-\" They then heard another cry as Mac came out of her house! \"What is it?\" Rocky asked, comforting them. \"What are all you hens crying about?\" \"It's-it's\" Babs just couldn't finish. Rocky handed her a tissue. \"Come on, we need to know so we can help,\" Ginger said. \"I don't know about those two, but my 8 little ones have disappeared!\" Bunty said, sobbing. \"Stabs is gone, too!\" Babs wailed. \"And my little one, Aimee, she's nowhere in sight,\" a stunned Mac said. Everyone stared at each other. Rocky and Ginger exchanged glances. \"THE CHICKS ARE MISSING!\" Everyone cried together. Suddenly, an annoyed Fowler came out of his hut. \"Order in the ranks, what what!\" he shouted. \"What is all this crying, you have to let an officer sleep, why, back in my day, crying was a sin-\" Ginger screamed, \"SHUT UP!\" Everyone stopped. \"How many times has that happened now?\" Rocky asked. Ginger glared at him. \"Look, everyone, clearly all the chicks have been taken from you by someone or something. And we are going to find out what it is that has taken it. There is no point screaming, crying and wailing, that will get you nowhere. I say tomorrow we have a meeting to sort this out!\" Babs, Mac, Bunty and other emerging crying mothers shook their heads and exchanged glances. \"Ginger, I am NOT waiting for my 8 babies to be killed! I am going to find them!\" Babs said. \"Look, if we have all of Chikin Park helping you out then you will find them sooner! There is no point going out individually and getting yourselves killed, and getting your chicks killed in the process!\" Ginger exclaimed. \"I am afraid I will have to agree! A jolly good ol' plan will capture the rat red-handed!\" Fowler said. \"So, Town Meeting tomorrow night - in Chikin Hall!\" Rocky called out. By Michael Carruthers ©[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Meeting All the chickens from Chikin Park gathered together the next night under a large tree, using long streaks of wood as seats. Ginger stood up the front with Mac, looking at the concerned chickens. \"Welcome everyone to tonight's meeting!\" Ginger called out. \"For those of you who have not been informed, the chicks have gone missing.\" Babs wailed and fell of her seat. Rocky handed her some cotton and needles and she started frantically stitching up something. \"Me and Mac have conducted a plan together to find the chicks, wherever they may be!\" Ginger said. Mac brought a stool up from behind the tree and stood on it a large piece of paper, with a very clever diagram written on it. \"I 'av successfully calc'ulated the precise times you found your chicks were missing -\" Bunty stood up, outraged. \"Maths will have no use here!\" she screamed. \"There is no point 'calc'ulating' their movements. Our chicks are gone and we need to find them!\" Mac went bright red. Babs joined her. \"I'm sick of you always taking charge, Mac! Your just brainy and you have no clue as to what is really going on!\" With that, Babs threw a needle at Mac. It bumped her on the dead and dropped to the ground. \"STOP THIS COMMOTION!\" someone called out from the back of the seats. It was Fowler. \"Why, back in my day, we had to work as a team! Air Force squadron 18 we were! Yes yes! Jimmy he was a fine fellow yes! So strange about the boats though. Yes. The boats. The water…\" And then he fell over. \"What the hell is wrong with him?\" Bunty shouted. Ginger walked over to Fowler. The other chickens followed her. They looked at him and then Ginger spotted a bottle of Friskey Chicksey by the tree. \"You guys have got him so worked up on this baby commotion he's resorted to alcohol!\" Ginger shouted. \"Now if you all just SHUT UP-\" \"I'm gonna start writing down how many times you-\" Rocky began to speak but ginger shot a warning look at him and he cowered in his seat. \"Now, if we just look at the factors with Mac maybe we can work this out!\" Ginger said. She turned to where Mac once stood. But she was no longer there. \"Mac?\" Ginger said. She was gone.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Despair Ginger sat with Rocky in their hutt, tears leaking out of her eyes. \"We always took her for granted. Now she's left,\" Ginger said. \"Baby-doll, she probably hasn't left, maybe she just needs some time to cool off,\" Rocky assured her. \"But Rocky, what if when she does come back, she's not the same Mac?\" Ginger asked. \"What if she's different, or hurt?\" She started desperately crying. \"What if I've lost my lovely friend forever? W-whose gonna…\" Rocky held her close and Ginger sobbed into Rocky's stomach. Meanwhile, Bunty and Babs had organised a search party to find the chicks. Bunty directed some chickens to search the west side of Chikin Park, and Babs, frantically knitting, told another group to go the other way. (\"It's fest isn't it? Yes. Go fest!\") Ginger and Rocky were asleep later that night, but Rocky woke up after hearing something in his hutt. He got up and looked around. He couldn't see anything. But someone has scribbled something on a piece of refill and slipped it under the door. W3'VE GUT YOR PRESHIZ CHIX MEET ME BI THE RIVA IN 1 HOUR Rocky raced off. He had no idea how long ago the small piece of refill was put under the door so he had to set off immediately. While running, Rocky bumped start into a chicken who sent him flying backwards. It was Bunty. \"Buntsbabe, what're you doing out here at this time of night?\" Rocky asked her. \"The search party…we split up accidentally. I got lost…\" Rocky saw her tears glowing in the night. \"Go north…it isn't far. I've got to go somewhere,\" Rocky said. And before Bunty could argue he sped off again. Rocky got to the river and fell over in exhausation. He got some river water and splashed it onto his face, sighing with relief. Alert again, he stood up and looked around. \"Hello?\" Rocky called out. \"Don't play games with me, I don't wanna go chook-fu on you man…\" A twig snapped. Someone stepped out from the shadows. Rocky's eyes went wide and he was speechless. Standing there, emotionless and looking rather threatening, was Mac.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Finding the Chicks Rocky stood looking at Mac, totally astounded. He didn't know whether to act very cautiously as Mac was looking rather evil, or to joke with her a bit. Fortunately she was the first to speak. \"I found the chicks. Fol'low me,\" she said blandly. Rocky obeyed. She was very quiet as they walked. In fact didn't speak a word. \"Mac…how come you slipped that note under my door?\" Rocky asked calmly. \"Wat noot?\" Mac asked. Rocky retrieved the note stuck in his feathers. \"'Don't be so ridiculous, yer cock'y cannon-shoot'ing rooster,\" Mac laughed. \"I would never 'ave such bad spellin'. I'm me remember. Always the one to be perfect…coom up with the plan…an' be brainy. The one nobo'y no'ices. The one no'ody apprec'ates.\" \"Mac…we really are-\" \"They're close,\" Mac interrupted him. \"Right around this bend.\" Rocky followed her around the bend and saw a well. He could hear faintly something screeching. \"They're stuck down the WELL?\" Rocky said in disbelief. \"How the heck did they get down there?\" Mac shrugged. They both hear something move in the grass. It was talking faintly. \"Get off!\" it said. \"It's my egg, you stupid rat!\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Mac's Deal Mac continue walking, through the grass that felt so soft on her feet. She ignored the wails of the baby and turned to face - Nick and Fletcher. \"What the bloody 'ell is goin' on?\" asked Nick, rather demanding. \"We've just had to help flamin' Rocky get his bloody chicks back!\" \"So, 'e got 'em did he?\" Mac said, sounding slightly impressed. \"Wif our help, of course,\" Fletcher said, smiling a little. \"Well, that's the leas' of their troubles,\" Mac said, smiling curiously. \"What do you man?\" Nick asked, concerned. \"Stealin' the babies is gonna seem lik' great af'er what I put 'em 'ens through, and me and my superior aren't fans of easy death.\" Nick and Fletcher both felt like they couldn't breathe. They couldn't speak, or move from fear. What Mac had just said was that she meant to kill off Chikin Park. Finally Fletcher spoke up. \"You're s-superior?\" he said in a quiet, nervous voice. \"You'll be meetin' 'im soon, I expect. 'Av a nice night, fellas,\" Mac said, and turned away, walking down a sloping hill. ** Ginger couldn't help herself. The fat tears rolled down her cheeks, and sadness consumed her. Rocky held his love close to his chest, kissing her head. Nick and Fletcher stood before Rocky and Ginger. \"Easy death?\" Rocky asked, still not believing not Nick and Fletcher had said. \"That's what she said. She was off her nut!\" Nick replied, still shaken from the experience. \"And she's working for someone?\" Rocky asked, keeping his cool. \"She said he had a superior, or sumfing,\" Fletcher said in a small voice. Fletcher stared at Ginger. She looked she was dead. She was staring straight ahead, not moving, not daring to breathe. \"Ginger?\" he said quietly, actually concerned about the chicken he had once despised. Ginger snapped up, looking at them. \"We need to find Mac, and find out who she's working for,\" Ginger said, commando-style. \"Isn't she dangerous, hun?\" Rocky asked, apparently surprised by his wife's sudden determination. \"I don't care. She's changed. She's not the Mac we knew,\" Ginger said, folding her arms. \"Do you mean we have to-\" Rocky began. \"We have to talk to her. I will not sit here, I will not do nothing, I will contribute, I will help, I will NOT let Mac destroy herself.\" Ginger said. The others dared not argue. \"Rocky, raise the alarm. Lock up houses, take the babies to the orphanage. We're going on a search.\" Ginger concluded. ** Over three hills and lying in a cornfield, Mac was smiling to the skies for her turn of fortune. \"They know we're coming then?\" a deep, scary voice boomed from behind her. \"That they do!\" Mac said, chuckling. \"And I'll just bet' their comin' for us right now!\" \"Bring them on,\" the deep voice said again. \"I can't thank ya enough, Rustin,\" Mac said in her sweet Scottish accent. \"You took me under your wing, I lov' ya for it.\" Rustin smiled, and stepping out the shadows, he revealed his figure once again to Mac, who had seen it now many times. He was a giant pit bull dog, a spiked chain around his neck, his eyes a dark shade of red, a threatening, huge figure…unafraid, absolute. \"Soon.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: Crucial Memories Mac remembered the smell like it was just yesterday. It helped that Alastor was causing that same smell, cooking his eggs. Scrambled he liked them, and laid out on a platter for him to eat. Alastor, the bulldog in which Mac now considered her mentor, had found her on the same day that had caused Mac's turn. The same smell of eggs was in the room, the same happy feeling consumed her. Mac lay on the grass, remembering that fateful day… Mac turned the eggs off the stove, angered at her daughter Darleen for being so careless. \"You do'n do this with Mammy's eggs!\" Mac said furiously. Then came the knock of at the door. \"Ooh, that mus' be Ginger. Com' on, Darleen, Sara, Gerald, Popsy, Molly! Off ya go to Aunt Babs!\" She called out to her children, filled with happiness about the day ahead. \"But, mother, why must we not come? Why must we go to Aunt Babs, what does she have in store-\" Gerald was the only boy of Mac's children, an extremely intelligent young male with a VERY British accent. \"Off ya go!\" Mac ordered, and Gerald and his sisters scuttled huffishly out the door, as Mac greeted Ginger, Rocky, Bunty, Maria and Paula at the door to her homestead. Maria was a very beautiful chicken, that had modeled herself after a picture she had once seen on a billboard of Grace Kelly. Her friend Paula was quite the opposite, she was a mud-obsessed bird with a brain of seed. \"Hi, Mac!\" Ginger greeted her brightly. \"Ready to go and see the show?\" she asked happily. \"Yep,\" Mac replied, a smile wide across her face. \"I'll jus' lock up de house and we'll be off!\" Mac shuffled her way outside, adjusting her glasses and locking the door with her keys moulded from various brands of cheese. \"Right! Let's be off!\" Rocky said, his arm around his wife Ginger. They began to walk toward Mac's gate, but she suddenly slapped her head stupidly. \"Dam! I lef' my picnic basket inside. Do ya mind waitin' just for a second while I ge' it?\" Mac asked, feeling a bit lame. \"Na, go ahead, babe. We'll just wait by the gate,\" Rocky assured her. \"OK, thank ya. I'll be out in a minute.\" Mac ran up to her house, and opened it. She heard the loud laughs of Maria and Paula, obviously excited about the event. She quickly grabbed her basket from underneath the sink and locked the door for the second time that day, and sprinted to the gate. Her friends were gone. Mac looked around. \"Allo?\" she called loudly. But her friends were nowhere in sight. Mac chuckled to herself. They must've been hiding, playing a game. \"Al'right…not the perfec' time for 'ide and go seek. Come out, we're gonna miss the show!\" Mac called. Her face suddenly heated up and she turned bright pink. She didn't realise that several chickens were now staring at her, obviously wondering what the hell she was on about. She gave the staring chickens a weak smile and looked around once more. There they were…but what were they doing? Running…running toward her? Or… Away from her. Mac swore she could hear little giggles. Her eyes narrowed underneath her large glasses, and her face twisted into an ugly, villainous frown. Mac began to walk. She had no idea what she was doing for anger had consumed her. Her vision seemed shaky…she did not see the path ahead of her. She didn't know where she was going…what she was doing and why she was doing it, but she walked on. A million thoughts ran through her head, each as worse as the next. Are they just joking around? Will they be waiting for me around this corner with a sorry and a hug? Did they perhaps see something that made them run? That was probably it. They might've been running from a dog or a hawk. But they were laughing. She swore she heard them laughing, giggling. Would they be laughing if they were being chased by a giant hawk or sharp-toothed dog? No. They were embarrassed to see me. Embarrassed to be with me. My friends. Mac did not realise she had come to the top of the Chikin Park Northern Hill. Chickens were laying down or sitting against trees everywhere, watching the destruction of the once infamous Tweedy's Chicken Farm. Mac could see Mr and Mrs Tweedy, her arch nemeses in the distance, watching as their home was destroyed by a crane and a bulldozer. The sight should've made Mac happy, but it didn't. Everyone around her cheered, and all she could do was feel the two single tears spill from each eye. She was alone. She was ugly, unwanted and alone. The sad thoughts turned to dark thoughts. They must be taught a lesson, they must see what it is like to feel these feelings of utter and complete rejection. If they were my friends, they wouldn't do this. They wouldn't laugh.[Chapter 8] Chicken Run: Ginger Wants Babies By Michael Carruthers © CHAPTER 8: The Confrontation Things had never been more busy at Chikin Park. The news of Mac's turn had travelled fast and many were panicking. Babs and Bunty were discussing leaving the park in case Mac had made an alliance, many chickens had heard Mac had died so were bursting out in tears, comforting each other on the street. The entire community knew that it had been Mac who stole the chicks, and either sadness or confusion was awry, though everyone was angry. As Ginger walked the dusty road of Chikin Park with Rocky's arm around her shoulder, she heard a group of her friends, including Maria and Paula, talking about how Mac would never be welcome in Chikin Park again. This saddened Ginger, she did not know how to feel about her friend's sudden change in personality. What had caused it? What was Mac planning? What did 'easy death' mean? Ginger did not know. \"What's on your mind?\" Rocky asked. His words were whispers so sweet even over the huge uproar of the community. Ginger looked up at him, as if he were stupid. \"Right, right…Mac. She's got herself in a rough spot, that one…\" Rocky said, sounding slightly sad. \"She's gone bonkers, and I'm not the only one who thinks so. She's working for someone, Rocky, I know it,\" Ginger said. \"She's goin' through a phase, doll,\" Rocky said, trying to sound relaxed. \"She'll be back to normal in no time.\" \"This is much more serious than going through a phase,\" Ginger confirmed. \"Many might think she's…\" Ginger looked again, and saw Maria and Paula constructing a poster that said \"ALL MACS BANNED\". \"…up to something…\" Ginger finished. She then knew what she had to do, like a lightning bolt it hit her. \"Rocky, dear, if you could go and organise Mac's children, they're over there - see?\" Ginger pointed out, sounding frantic. \"Sure, I'll take them back to our crib. Where are you going?\" Rocky asked, a little worried. \"I have to find Mac,\" Ginger said, and began to walk away. Rocky grabbed her arm and pulled her back. \"You have to what what with what?!\" Rocky asked insanely. \"Are you crazy ?\" \"Rocky! I have to talk to her. I have to get through to her before whatever she's planning turns this town ape-crazy,\" Ginger said, shrugging Rocky away. Rocky hesitated. \"I don't like this idea,\" he began. Ginger was about to retaliate, but Rocky continued before she could speak. \"But if you think you need to do what is best for your friend…I think you should.\" Ginger smiled, slightly moved. \"I won't be long,\" Ginger said, and kissed him on the cheek. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" And Ginger was gone. ** Over the hill she walked, until she came to the tree. Their tree. She looked at it, saddened. It was only three or four days ago that Rocky had helped her up that tree, and they had discussed their feelings about having children. It all seemed so meaningless now, with what was going on. She walked on, entering the cornfields. Mac too was walking in the cornfields, gathering corn and goods for Alastor's meal and her own. Slowly, Mac took off her glasses. Her vision was still blurry. For three days she had been trying to take off her glasses and see without them, but she could not. \"Dam' things!\" she cursed. Ginger whipped around. \"Mac,\" she said quietly to herself in a voice of realisation. As Mac rambled on, Ginger followed the perturbed voice and the figure of Mac approached her. She was bending over picking what looked like worms out of the ground and putting them in a basket. \"Little buggers!\" Mac said, as the worms wriggled around in her hands. \"Mac…\" Ginger's voice came softly. Mac swirled around and faced Ginger. \"Oh, it's just you. For a mom'nt there I was worried,\" Mac said, and went back to her worm picking. \"Mac, you need to stop what you're doing,\" Ginger said in a concerned voice. \"Sorry, can' do that,\" Mac replied. \"Need the worms for the stew. They're not quite to my taste but Alastor likes them.\" \"Alastor?\" Ginger said, quizzical. \"Yes, Alastor. Now…please leave,\" Mac said. She barely seemed to notice it was Ginger. \"Mac…please…please come back to Chikin Park, we can sort this out!\" Ginger said pleadingly. \"How abou' no, OK Ginger?\" Mac replied harshly, dropping the basket, facing Ginger and folding her arms. Ginger was seriously taken aback. \"Just tell me why, please, and I'll do what I can…\" Ginger was interrupted by some very harsh words. \"You'll do wha' you bloody well can a'right. Nothin'. Cos that's wha' you're good for - nothin', except maybe being a really bad so-call'd friend. Remember the day of the destrruction of Tweedy's farm? I went back inside to get my key, and when I came bac' outside, all my friends were runnin' off larfin. The perfec' opportunity to ditch me, and I though' I was your frien'.\" Mac's slow revelation of her sudden outburst of anger was tragic to Ginger, and she began to cry, several tears spilling out of her eyes that shone like small beacons in the moonlight. \"Mac…\" she whispered helplessly. \"No, Ginger. Don' call me tha'. Don't pretend we're still friends, cos we're not. Now I advise you leave…but before you do…I muss' say, I loved you and Rocky's littl' get together on the tree a few nights back. 'Oh, Rocky! But babies! Whatever will we do bout our friends!'\" Mac mocked Ginger with a strangely high-pitched voice. \"But you got over it in abou' a second, didn'tcha? Cos you juss' don't care bout your friends, Ginger.\" More tears spilled helplessly from Ginger's eyes, she was broken. Mac just smiled, like a little girl who had just received her doll. \"Now you can leave.\" ** Mac arrived at the campsite, many worms had escaped during her confrontation with Ginger. \"Where's my tea?\" Alastor shouted. His voice was a grizzly British one, like an English Michael Clarke Duncan. \"Forget tea. I'm sick of bakin'. I'm sick of talkin'.\" Mac said straight-forwardly, pacing as she walked. \"Tomorrow. Tomorrow we attack Chikin Park.\" \"We aren't ready-\" Alastor began, but was interrupted by Mac. \"Then GET READY. Because, tomorrow, we'll mak' them scream.\" Storyline to be continued in a megasized 4-part chapter…watch this space…[Chapter 9] Chicken Run: Ginger Wants Babies By Michael Carruthers © CHAPTER 9: All That's Left - Part 1 of a Conclusive 3 Part Chapter It was hard to look straight, his vision was blurry and he had been concussed for a couple of days. When he could get his eyes fully open, Fowler found he was looking at a beautiful chicken - Ginger. She was caring for him, gently dabbing a cut on Fowler's forehead. \"Ginger…\" Fowler stirred. \"And so he awakes,\" smiled Ginger. \"W-what happened…\" said Fowler weakly, blinking several times, his vision still slightly blurred. \"A little to your left,\" Ginger said somewhat sarcastically. Mac turned his throbbing head to the side and saw, in full view, a large bottle of Friskey Chicksey. \"Oh, alcohol,\" Mac said. \"I remember alcohol.\" \"You got conked out for the past two and a half days, Fowler\" Ginger said disapprovingly. \"You've missed out on a lot of the things that've gone on here.\" Mac looked up at Ginger, now worried. Ginger soaked the flannel she was using in a nearby bucket of water. \"Ginger?\" asked Fowler. \"What's gone on here?\" Ginger looked lost. She did not know where to begin, or how to even tell the story of deception and horror. She summed it up rather quickly, and did not go into details. \"Mac has betrayed us. After stealing everyone's chicks, she left Chikin Park and is working for someone named Alastor.\" A look of genuine terror crossed Fowler's face. \"Ginger…did you say Alastor?\" asked Fowler. \"Yes…why? Do you know something?\" Ginger said, now intrigued. \"You must be absolutely sure that the name was Alastor!\" said Fowler, now alarmed. \"I AM!\" screamed Ginger. \"Okay, calm down…by crikey!\" Fowler said sternly, reminding Ginger of his RSA days. \"Alastor is the Tweedy's pit-bull dog.\" Ginger now wore the same terrified expression. \"The big one?\" she said foolishly. \"No, Ginger, the small one!\" replied Fowler sarcastically. \"God, hold your horses, calm down,\" Ginger said, shrugging. She buried her head in her palms. \"Oh God, what are we going to do!\" *** \"WHAT?!\" screamed Bunty. \"WE'RE…LEAVING!?\" \"It's only best,\" said Ginger, trying to talk over the loud masses of chickens screaming angrily at her and Fowler, who were standing at the front of the Chikin Hall. \"BEST?\" roared Bunty. \"BEST? AFTER WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH TO GET HERE, AND FOR FREEDOM? NOW WE HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THAT ALL OVER AGAIN!\" \"Well, what do you propose we do, Bunty?\" Ginger threw back. \"Me and Fowler can't think of any other resolution!\" \"Oh, but of course it was you and FOWLER who had to decide!\" said Rocky in an envious tone. Ginger was surprised. \"Rocky…I'm sorry, but we…\" \"Oh, shut up, you twirp,\" interrupted Bunty yet again. \"You can sort out your love life later! Right now we have to decide what all of us are going to do!\" \"I don't see why we can't just stay here,\" said Paula, who was rubbing some mud around in her hands. \"Oh, shut up you seed-brain!\" shouted Fowler. \"Hey, tommo!\" said Maria in Paula's defence. \"She has a point. This is just ONE pit bull dog. We can take ONE.\" \"We have no proof that it is just one, Maria!\" retorted Fowler. \"Alastor could've gathered together over TEN dogs…we can take three at the most!\" \"Well, why is Alastor even attacking us? What did we ever do to him?\" said Rocky. \"Apart from piss him off a whole heap when we were at Tweedy's.\" \"I'll tell you whose fault it is, Rocky!\" shouted Bunty. \"It's that BLOODY MAC! Always gettin' her face in the dirt, ain't that right? I say we go after her and be done with it! Negotiate with the dogs!\" \"Have Mac's head!\" said a random chicken from the right side of Chikin Hall. \"WE'RE NOT GOING KILL MAC!\" screamed Ginger. Everyone went silent for a few seconds, as Ginger spoke. \"That would be murderous…against one of our friends!\" \"EX-friends!\" said Paula, playing with an empty bottle of Friskey Chicksey. Fowler looked a little concerned. \"Who gives a flying tub of bird seed!\" roared Bunty. \"Mac plans to kill us!\" \"You can't fight fire with fire!\" replied Ginger. \"Says who!?\" retorted Ginger. \"BLOODY BIRDS!\" a voice came from somewhere above the chickens. Every chicken looked up. \"Who is that?\" called Rocky. Out of the shadows came Nick and Fletcher. They were standing on a wooden plank holding up Chikin Hall. \"Come to offer some insightful suggestions?\" asked Maria rudely. She had always hated Nick and Fletcher, for they set her hair on fire once. \"We've come to offer INTELLIGENCE, to you idiot CHICKENS,\" said Nick. \"Yeah!\" cried Fletcher in agreement. \"Shaddup, Fletch you bugger,\" nudged Nick. \"I told you to let me do to the talking!\" \"Sorry, mate,\" said Fletcher, burrowing his face in his sleeves. \"Anyway, you birds have got to leave!\" continued Nick. \"We've seen these dogs - there are six at least, maybe more! You don't stand a flamen' chance!\" \"What makes you think we should listen to YOU?\" said Maria, who had just put on a hat. \"I believe he just said why, perhaps you should stop looking in the mirror and pay more attention,\" said Paula. All of the chickens, most of whom considered Paula to be the most brainless creature living on this Earth or the next, looked genuinely surprised and impressed with her boldness. \"This coming from the chicken who just argued why we should STAY?\" spat Maria. \"This is BOGUS, you HACKS!\" screamed Nick. \"Enough of these little chick-to-chick arguments and unimportant mutterings! You all have to leave NOW…or you will all DIE!\" This shut everyone up instantly. The bickering and arguments stopped. Every eye was now on Nick. \"So what'll it be?\" *** \"Comfy enough up there, pet?\" growled Alastor. \"Quit', darlin',\" said Mac, who was riding on Alastor's back as they walked to Chikin Park, the cool night air breezing through Mac's complexion. \"Coul' we hurry it up a bit, Alasta, mate?\" said Umar, one of the nine pit bulls on the voyage to Chikin Park. \"There's no rush,\" replied Alastor. \"But we want some poultrrrrryyyyy,\" said Jakob, another one of the dogs, who seemed to emphasise the end of every sentence. \"You'll get plenty in time, I promise you,\" said Alastor. He was always very calm. \"Why can't we 'av her!\" asked Umar, licking his lips. \"SHE IS NOT FOR DEVOURING, YOU FOOL!\" shouted Alastor, very concerned and protective of Mac. \"Ai'ght, a'ight…\" said Umar, backing away. \"Don't worry, buddy,\" confirmed Chip, a slender and kind-looking, but on the inside very hurtful and destructive, pit bull. \"We'll be there soon enough, and there'll be panic, and ruin…\" *** \"GEAR UP THE AEROPLANE!\" shouted Fowler, walking down the centre of Chikin Park as the chickens were running frantically in and out of their huts, grabbing possessions and loading them onto the Chikin Express, an Aircraft created in Tweedy's Farm to get out Tweedy's Farm. Rocky had taken lookout and was sitting on top of the large tree that he and Ginger had decided they were going to have children on. Fowler and Fletcher were busily readying the control panel of the aircraft and making sure everything was in order, while Ginger and Nick were fixing an error on one of the wings. Ginger was using a screwdriver while Nick held a nail in place. \"You've really matured,\" said Ginger, randomly out of nowhere. \"Excuse me?\" said Nick politely. \"Oh, I was just saying, you've matured,\" Ginger repeated. \"How so?\" Nick asked. \"Just back there…you were really commanding and informative…really caring,\" Ginger said nicely. \"Why?\" \"Well…I guess I just like you chickens,\" said Nick in a joking way, but Ginger smiled at him and Nick smiled at her, and for a single moment she felt hope. About 20 minutes later, Ginger had climbed aboard the Chikin Express along with every other chicken in Chikin Park, aside from Rocky, who was still on the tree on lookout duty. \"Are we ready to go?\" Ginger asked. \"We are,\" said Fowler. He flicked a few switches and lights gave way. \"BEGIN PEDALLING!\" called Fowler to the chickens. \"HURRY UP TOO!\" The chickens began to pedal and the express came closer to the runway ramp. \"So we'll just pick up Rocky and be off,\" Ginger said, sighing. \"No, Ginger,\" said Fowler sadly, not daring to look into her eyes. \"What?\" Ginger asked hesitantly. \"Rocky knew what he had to do before taking the job of look-out manager,\" Fowler informed, as they neared the runway. \"He'll find his own way home.\" \"FOWLER!\" Ginger screamed. \"NO!\" The aeroplane took off, and many of the chickens clapped as they soared over Chikin Park, leaving it behind. Ginger managed to run between the aisles to look out the very back of the aircraft and had one last look at Rocky. \"Rocky…no…\" Ginger said as she cried, Rocky becoming a faint spot in the distance.

It addresses who the boy in the statue is, since he can't be her half brother, and some ideas of what the Faun's real name is. Just in case you miss it in the text, Moanna is sixteen, and I believe I've edited out the explanation of why, just know that he calls her Ofelia, and she calls him Pan. Yes you can interpret this as a FaunXMoanna piece if you like; otherwise it can be just a conversation between the princess and her guardian. Oh by the way, I don't own Pan's Labyrinth. Please enjoy. \"Who is the baby there, Pan?\" \"Look at how these blossoms have sprung up over night.\" \"I know you heard me, you always hear me.\" \"Did the ball please you?\" \"It was alright, I guess. But I didn't like that prince, what's his face, always following me around.\" \"Well boys will be boys. Heh-heh\" \"I didn't see you there.\" \"Does that make you cross, Princess?\" \"Yes! I thought I could count on you to scare off all the would-be suitors!\" \"Hm…\" \"Promise me.\" \"Almost anything.\" \"Promise me you'll protect me next time.\" \"Hm…\" \"Pan?\" \"What if next time you don't want me to?\" \"Why wouldn't I want you to?\" \"You are still so young Princess. You have yet to know what it is like to be a woman.\" \"And you know that field so well?\" \"No, it's just…\" \"Well, for your information I am a woman in every right.\" \"Not every right. I do know of the one of which you speak. In fact I always notice the shift in your sent every moon cycle. Don't blush; it's as natural as anything can be. But you have yet to lay with a man, not until then will you understand what being an adult truly means.\" \"Wh-what makes you so certain?\" \"I know you better than any. Not only would I have smelt it, but there is no possible way you could have hidden it from me. Your very presence would have changed. No my dear Moanna you are the maiden in every sense of the word.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \"You are still a vir…\" \"NO, no, I meant, what did you mean by saying I was 'the maiden'?\" \"Both your body and mind are young. You are still free, innocent…\" \"You mean ignorant?\" \"Yes, if would like to call it that, you are very ignorant.\" \"…\" \"Princess…Moanna look at me.\" \"…\" \"…\" \"Am I just a child to you?\" \"I would never call you a child.\" \"Then what do you mean by I am ignorant?\" \"Princess I do not mean that you could never understand, but that at this moment in life, you simply can't. You have lived in this form for only sixteen years. You cannot know life as I have known it, for I have lived much longer than you. I know things about this world, done things, you have not, and should not do yet. I have experienced what you cannot even dream of knowing.\" \"You said the same thing when we met.\" \"Hn?\" \"You said that you had names only the wind and the trees could pronounce, but I have still learned one name of yours, Pan, can I not also learn to experience what you have?\" \"I would rather you did not, besides, Pan is not any of my names.\" \"It's what that elder faun called you; the one with the goat's face.\" \"He was only kidding.\" \"Oh, about what?\" \"It's…just a joke amongst our kin.\" \"Pan, he was a god wasn't he?\" \"Yes, a god very much older than I.\" \"Yes, I've read about him, him and his faun followers, and what they would do to the nymphs they'd chase after.\" \"Where did you read such a thing?\" \"From the book you gave me. Every night it has a new story. The night I was wondering about what the old faun said, it showed me a story about Pan. At first I wondered that you might be a god, but then I thought better of it, just assumed you were named after him or something.\" \"Why? Am I not hansom enough to be a god?\" \"Ha, no, no. It's just because you are nothing like that Pan.\" \"Is that so? Perhaps I am.\" \"I know you don't run around getting drunk and molesting tree women.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yes, I'd smell it.\" \"Hah! You would, would you now?\" \"Yes, I've come across a few drunks, and they all smelt distinctly of alcohol, even sometime after they've sobered up. Besides, you said it yourself; I am still an innocent maiden.\" \"What do you mean be that?\" \"…My, ah, parents would never allow me such contact with someone like that.\" \"Maybe I've fooled them.\" \"It wouldn't surprise me, you fool a lot of people into thinking you're something you're not, like a monster. But it wouldn't matter because you can't fool me.\" \"I can't?\" \"No. For instance, I know that this entire conversation was a just a deploy so that you didn't have to answer my previous question.\" \"Oh and what was that?\" \"I also know that you happen to remember what my question was, but for the sake of time I'll repeat it: Who's the baby on the statue?\" Well I would love to do a series of pieces like this, however, let me know if the dialogue only thing worked, or if I should go back and change it. I don't know, it seemed to flow well enough. Drop me a line, let me know if I should continue.[Chapter 2] \" Icomehomeinthemorninglight\" What in the world was that sound the Faun thought as he wandered down the corridor, hooves making a click, click sound on the floor. \" Mymothersayswhenyougonnaliveyourliferight\" He stopped in front of the princess's bedchamber, surely that noise couldn't be coming from in there. He pressed his long ears up against the bedroom door, listening to a strange form of music vibrating from within. Wait, a song perhaps, but what was it saying? \"Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones\" Yes those were words. He put an hand on the door handle and turned the knob, only to be blown away by what he saw. \"And girls they want to have faun, Oh girls just want to have faun\" Was that Moanna standing on the bed in naught but her bed clothes, and why was she holding a hair brush to her mouth? \"The phone rings in the middle of the night My father yells what you gonna do with your life Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one But girls they want to have faun Oh girls just want to have –\" Had he eyebrows to raise, they would be located somewhere near his horns at that point. He recognized the song from the human realm, and couldn't help but notice she was singing the words wrong.The princess then preceded to perform a multitude of silly and uncoordinated dance moves. Though however much grace she lacked, the Faun did note she could really move those teenage hips.Well, I just take them to another world altogether' he thought. \"I want to be the one to walk in the sun\" The Faun could have laughed at the irony of that line. \"Oh girls they want to have faun Oh girls just want to have\" Really why hadn't she noticed him behind her yet. Really that girl, it would seem his hopes of teaching her to defend herself would be wasted. The music from the orb in the corner may have been blaring at volumes immune only to the teenage ears, but she should at least be able to sense a familiar presence. Dear gods she was a good dancer though. \"That's all they really want A faun When the working day is done Girls - they want have fauns Oh girls just want to have fauns They want to have faun, They want to have faun...\" As the music died down and switched to another, calmer song, the princess turned around and looked straight at her Guardian, a radiant smile on her face. \"That's all they really want A Faun When the working day is done Girls - they want a faun Oh girls just want to have fauns\" \"Some boys take a beautiful girl And hide her away from the rest of the world\" ' The faun hid his surprise well at the fact she had in fact known he was there the entire time, and made a small bow, \"Princess\" \"Enjoying the show?\" she hopped off the bed and moved toward the doors. \"Perhaps\" he slid a smooth hand under her face, cupping it. But just as she leaned into it, the Faun pulled away and shut the doors, \"You're late for breakfast\" he said through the closed doors. Smiling, he heard her make a peeping sound and scramble for her clothes. Instructing some servants that Moanna would most likely need help, he sauntered off to the great hall where her parents would need a convincing excuse for their daughter's tardiness. Hooves clicking on the floors he hummed quietly, \" Oh girls they just to have fauns…\" Jeez I seriously was not going to continue on this story, but you people just had to bug me with all of your encouraging reviews didn't you. Well fine you big babies. Alright I'm kidding, this had been in my head awhile, and I had some time so I figured I'd thank all you guys for your wonderful reviews. I think this may turn into my experimenting story where I can try out different styles. Tell me what you think, oh and seriously, next time you hear this song (Girls just want to have fun) try replacing fun with faun it's almost scary how well this song fits the movie, well excluding the whole upbeat and happy nature thing. Merry Meet. PS What do you think of the new tittle?[Chapter 3] Sometimes he despised how good he was at hiding the truth. You cannot lie in the Underworld, for whatever reason, no being, spirit, god, or otherwise, was capable of it. Perhaps it was amazing bluntness of death that caused this, or the good nature of the feys who dwelt in it, but for whatever reason, forming a lie became impossible in its depts. So of course, the Faun, like a few others, had been raised simply to tell only that which was needed and in a very mysterious way. Hiding one's true feelings on certain subjects, or pretending a specific action did not bothered you, was evidently not considered lying. Amazingly, he did not hide this talent of his. In fact, one could say he flaunted it, saying in a silent way to everyone he met, ha-ha, you fool, I know what you do not, and there is nothing you can do to stop it. He cloaked himself in mystery, wrapping around himself as a cold man buries himself in a blanket. That hidden wonder, the prize in the darkness, he had used it to lure many an unsuspecting creature, human or otherwise. Oh how women loved it, foolish females thinking they could be the ones to lure his secrets out, ha. Oh he let them play their game, acted along as though he was enchanted be them; held no secrets from them. People rarely realized their gift for reading body langue. Perhaps that was it his complete control over his gestures. A tiny flick of the wrist, never allowing a stray hand or hoof, to obscure a view of his body, acts of innocence they would think. Please. Still their antics were amusing, the game kept his mind busy. For centuries he was able to keep boredom at bay, frolicking in the Mediterranean country sides, sometimes with his own kind, other times not. In fact he had spent many years with the great god Pan, himself, learning from the master. Oh Pan was something else, truly a man of the wild, but soft in heart. Perhaps that had been why the Faun eventually left his side. \" Oh, my son,\" he had said one day in a slur soft with wine, \"They call you the next me, ha!\" \" Certainly,\" replied a drunken young nymph, sprawled her nakedly across Pan's lap, \"he is just as good with the women, milord.\" \" Indeed,\" giggled another, whose own naked flesh was caught glimmering in the soft fire light, \"indeed\" she purred, nuzzling her face into the Faun's lap. Without even thinking to do it, he petted her tangled hair with a distant gesture, it wasn't anything personal, but he knew she would think it meant his thoughts were only on her. Silly thing, he couldn't even recall if she had a name. \" Bah,\" Pan bellowed, taking another swig of the strong elixir, \"the boy is nothing like me. He takes too much pleasure in the hunt, and not enough in the rewards,\" playfully he buried his nose between the giggly girl's breasts, \"And then he just leaves the poor things discarded for me or the boys to deal with,\" boys being the satyrs, fauns, and other creatures that flocked about the god, \"not that that's always so bad, but you should hear the wailings.\" \" Oh poor girls,\" the nymph coed, reaching up to play with Pan's beard. The faun noticed how he seemed to have faded from their minds, but he did not mind being ignored if it meant the conversations concerning him would cease. Alas after a few minutes of playful groping, their attentions turned back to him. \" Perhaps it is that women are not to his taste, perhaps he should go for the youths?\" \" The same, my dear,\" the god replied, \"Except that in the end the boys put up a bit more of a fight. We are left with such a mess afterwards. The boys can go so blood crazed when their pride is wounded, then they assume that simply because the muscles beneath their skin is bulging and taunt, they are a match for, my son here! Ha! Though I must say, it is an arousing sight, especially when he ends up taking them in the end.\" \" Oh such words!\" acclaimed the nymph, \"Do not stray your thoughts too long on boys, for I have no wish to be left cold this night!\" \" Oh indeed,\" he laughed a great bellowing thunder,\" Worry not, for long is the night I wished to feel the soft flesh of a woman!\" \" Long indeed, was in not earlier this evening I saw you in the embrace of an Acadian woman?\" \" Oh, sometimes I think those women are more male than I!\" \" Bold words for one whose has swooned after Amazons.\" The Faun retorted, all thoughts of the virgin in his lap gone. \" Now, my son,\" he chuckled, glad to have his favorite conversing fellow joining in the playful bantering once more, \"You know as well as I those women who spend their nights amongst other women are more female than those who lie amongst…\" \"… us.\" The Faun finished coldly, slipping from beneath the finally passed out girl. He stood leaving the ring of fire and laughter behind. The cool night breeze, banished any desire that may have made him return to the fire side. Off in the distance somewhere, a subordinate of Athena hooted. Along a trickling mountain stream he sat, hooves swallowed by the crisp water. But before the calm could take him he felt a bolt of lightning pass threw his body. A deep, thundering voice, called out his name. \" You should not use that name so lightly.\" The Faun whispered to the god as his skin began to prickle. \" And you should not shame it so easily.\" Turning, the Faun saw not the content, lecherous old being from the fire, but faced instead a great deity of the forest, powerful in every action, from his stone like hooves to the tip of his great horns. This was a being to bow to, and the Faun did. \"You of all beings should know my tongue never loosens from simple peasant brews.\" The Faun nodded, he knew the god meant every word he spoke. \"It does displease me that you find no pleasure in our acts. It is cruel, and sadistic, your actions. Where has that wise child I knew gone?\" To this, the Faun could not answer, so he simply turned to gaze at the moon. It was a long time until either of the men spoke again. \" She won't answer you.\" \" What\" the fey jerked from his moon gazing. \" The moon, she won't speak to you who are so cruel to her daughters.\" \" What makes you think I long for her company?\" \" Ha, boy, don't make me laugh. We, all us creatures, we long for her touch, her simple caresses, the great lady of the night. We all desire her.\" Normally the Faun might retort something about how many men are more content to feel the sun's presence, but that night he held his tongue. \" How is it then,\" he began after a while, \"that she speaks to you?\" \" Me? Why would the great goddess not speak with me, I am not the one who denies her power, nor do I mock her daughters. I lie with both women and men in sacred union; it is not just a game to me. But it is for you.\" When the fey made no move to speak, Pan continued, \"The times are changing, my son, I can feel it on the wind, men are changing. Can you not sense it in the humans that join us? There is a barren edge to the practices of the people, an enslavement of the goddess. Perhaps I am but a fool in my thinking of this, but it may be your change in attitude is due to this new corruption. What say you?\" The Faun cocked his head, brows narrowing, a face of innocence coming over him. \" Don't play that game with me, I am not so foolish that those tricks of yours can deceive me. I will not permit this behavior in one of my followers. Go back to the Underworld, while you still can the corruption here, is too great for you. Let your coven make of you what they will, for you have no place amongst our fire, and they surely have missed you.\" The ancient deity sighed, \"I love you dearly, my son, but I fear you will not find what your heart seeks here. Go now, before the sun arises. Be gone from the Middleworld.\" The Faun shed no tears, for in the centuries he had spent away from the Underworld; his heart had grown colder, less caring. Turning the Faun bounded away from his mentor, racing away from the pain the parting from his dear friend had caused. \" Merry Meet\" the wind whispered, but diving into the parting of a great tree's roots, he refused to reply. The Faun spent an age in the Underworld, again amongst his own coven, but even his family's love could not fully cure him. Still he lied with words of truth. Still he distanced himself from the others, and longed once more to gaze upon the shining face of the moon. Again and again he promised himself, that he would be truthful, but to no avail, as soon as he tried to speak the words, some form of distraction would always stop him, some nagging nuisance. She was the only one he hid from. The only one he could not come up with some answer for any question. She was the only one he would turn in front of, so that she could not always see him fully. The only one he ever stuttered in front of, the only one he could change subjects on, and still she would call him on it later. Funny, how not even the true lies, could fool Moanna, the daughter of the moon.[Chapter 4] \"What do you mean you have to leave?\"The Faun refused to let his eyes wonder from the game board. Deciding to grab only two seeds this time he skipped across the wooden depressions, ignoring those pleading brown eyes. \"Hm, your turn.\" \"But you still haven't…\" \"If you don't make a move it means you forfeit, and I win.\" Sighing, Moanna picked up a pile of seeds at random, unluckily for her, they all seemed to sow themselves into their spots too perfectly, her turn was very long. When her hand was guided a third time around the tiny wooden plate, she snapped her head up to stare at her guardian. A long fingered hand was set upon his lips, covering a smirk, while his horned head remained cocked to the side, steadily observing Moanna's moves. Noticing that her hand had stopped, he raised his head to meet her disbelieving stare. Feral blue eyes glanced at hers, glinting a smile. \"You cheated,\" the Princess accused, her face bewildered. The Faun leaned back with several creaks to rest his back against a pillar. \"Actually, Princess, there is no rule in Mancala about guiding your opponents hand.\" His eyes twinkled. \"Besides, it's only cheating when you make your opponent loose.\" \"It's still cheating.\" \"Does it matter, either way, you win.\" The faun chuckled. \"I don't want to play with someone who makes me win every game.\" Moanna, too, leaned against her bench until her back pressed against a pillar. She folded her arms, mimicking her Guardian. \"A thousand apologies\" You know I wouldn't bother to keep writing this stuff if you guys weren't so freaking nice. God damn you all. Those wonderful reviews make me sick with pleasure. I hope you like this (goes away to sit in corner and cry manly tears). Mancala is a very old game from Africa that traditionally is not played at night because that is the time when the spirits play.[Chapter 5] The faun had been dying for a long time. Many ages had passed he first felt that inevitable twinge in his back, a slight stiffening of his joints. Centuries had come and gone since he began to find a falter in his impeccable memory, for the memory of ancient trees is stronger than that of any other being. Their bark soaks in all the world around and carves tales into rings clearer than any tome or tablet. It was the little things that went first. Names never seemed to reach his ears, he that once could recall the title of every dryad and nymph along the Adriatic and her sisters. Not that he had ever been one to meet new people unless some benefit could be gained. Insulting courtiers was certainly no grievance to him, but when the day came that he could not call his fey companions to him (these were not of course the little green, blue, and red pixies, but their great grandchildren for those old companions had long since withered like last spring's leaves) the faun was forced to admit it was time to slow down. He began to sleep more beneath the cypress trees that grew along the edges of the meadows, while younger fauns danced merrily in the gay vigor of youth. He watched birds flutter and the pixies fly and was content to observe the dancers spin past. He would even clap some with his wicked old grin, delighting in the respect he was shown when some young doe would fetch a goblet for him. An elder indeed he chuckled thinking that even if he could no longer whip those upstart satyrs with the strength of his great hooves or looming horns, he could still best any in wit. But long after resigning himself that he was no longer fit for spring posturing, the faun found himself exhausted even by the festivities of autumn and even winter. It was then he decided to leave the groves and the songs and the noises which gave him head aches for the solitude of growing things from which he had first came. He ventured deep into the forests where the trees grew like great pillars holding a misty dark canopy from which little light could seep except in beams which fell on moss covered pools among the roots. The smell of earth and decaying leaves filled the air with its musty scent, and the ferns drooped with an ever present mist. Small sounds like the chattering of mice were lost in the fog, and even the great bellows of woodlands stags could not travel far outside their glade. In such a place where a rare beam of sunlight fell upon a sourceless pool he rested. A bed of leaves cushioned his aching back, and between the legs of a great tree, which had stood since before the stars, he rested. Arms came out and settled on the great roots as if they had been wrought for that purpose alone. His hooves stretched out and sank in the soft soil; his eyes closed, and did not open much after that. Though the silence and solitude offered by the forest was great, it was not complete, and many times was he visited by young companions. Young of course, for the old ones had all long since gone. He was sought for advice, or comfort, or simply for the peaceful presence which those who are resigned to enjoy what time they have left often carry. Of course after awhile it was only the latter that some came for. The faun's mind had slowed and his voice was raspy and easily tired. Those that ventured into the deep forest seeking the fabled old faun found his stories were few and often repeated, though they were the greatest stories of his life. Certainly they were not the happiest, nor the most exciting, but they were the most important memories he had, and it was a very, very long time until any of them faded from his mind. There was one girl, whose name who could never recall hearing, that came again and again and asked to hear the story of the princess he had waited for all those years. Even the faun's crusted eyes would open at the sound of the name of the one he had loved so dearly. A breath of spring in an age of winter, he called her with a creaking grin, for though age had made him sentimental, it had not dulled his humor. The little girl asked him how they had met, but he never spoke of that, as if there was nothing before those two had known one another. She never asked how the princess left the lands, but he told it every time. He did not speak of the joy of her rein, for there was none in all the lands who did not know it, nor did he speak of her marriage, who's joys he had not shared, except in the delight he found in the many children brought into the world by that union. Their names were some of the last to leave him, though in his mind their faces were still round with youth, even though most of them had already sired grandchildren by then. To him they remained the picture of childhood, bouncing on his knees, begging for stories and games in the gardens of eternal spring. Eventually there came a time when he could not open his misted eyes and cracked mouth to tell even these stories, though he whispered a name sometimes that sounded more like a sigh than the last pangs of a devotion that he kept him breathing for so many eons. A time came when the faun could no longer be distinguished from the roots of the great tree, if indeed he had not already become a part of them. His hooves split, his hands melted into the roots and his great round horns sunk into the depths of the bark, and the faun that had always been more tree than man finally returned to the great pillar that had spawned him. He did not die, but he did wither. Little piece by little piece he withered like the face of a mountain eroding back into the dirt. Seekers to the spot still felt him for ages after that, still heard his wispy chuckle in the wind, even after the roots ceased to resemble a vague sitting figure. In time, his face was forgotten, his name, and then his legend. He faded, like a star which had burned since the beginning, becoming dust in the black, he was gone. But he did not mind, for the faun had been dying for a long time, and once one dies, one can live once more, the dust from old stars forms new ones after all. Of course he was given a new name. Well my lovelies here you are. Now if you are wondering what chapter Moanna gets married in or when kiddies happen, or when did this stop being funny/FM, fear not. This \"story\" is just a random collection. No \"chapter\" bleeds into another unless otherwise mentioned. I've gotten a lot of flattering comments asking for more stories. However I need a little motivation and some ideas to play with, so: Send me a comment - I'll respond Send me an idea - I'll write it Hope to hear from you soon my scrumptious little readers :)","LastChapter":"The faun had been dying for a long time.

Insulting courtiers was certainly no grievance to him, but when the day came that he could not call his fey companions to him (these were not of course the little green, blue, and red pixies, but their great grandchildren for those old companions had long since withered like last spring's leaves) the faun was forced to admit it was time to slow down. He began to sleep more beneath the cypress trees that grew along the edges of the meadows, while younger fauns danced merrily in the gay vigor of youth. He watched birds flutter and the pixies fly and was content to observe the dancers spin past. He would even clap some with his wicked old grin, delighting in the respect he was shown when some young doe would fetch a goblet for him. An elder indeed he chuckled thinking that even if he could no longer whip those upstart satyrs with the strength of his great hooves or looming horns, he could still best any in wit. But long after resigning himself that he was no longer fit for spring posturing, the faun found himself exhausted even by the festivities of autumn and even winter. It was then he decided to leave the groves and the songs and the noises which gave him head aches for the solitude of growing things from which he had first came. He ventured deep into the forests where the trees grew like great pillars holding a misty dark canopy from which little light could seep except in beams which fell on moss covered pools among the roots. The smell of earth and decaying leaves filled the air with its musty scent, and the ferns drooped with an ever present mist. Small sounds like the chattering of mice were lost in the fog, and even the great bellows of woodlands stags could not travel far outside their glade. In such a place where a rare beam of sunlight fell upon a sourceless pool he rested. A bed of leaves cushioned his aching back, and between the legs of a great tree, which had stood since before the stars, he rested. Arms came out and settled on the great roots as if they had been wrought for that purpose alone. His hooves stretched out and sank in the soft soil; his eyes closed, and did not open much after that. Though the silence and solitude offered by the forest was great, it was not complete, and many times was he visited by young companions. Young of course, for the old ones had all long since gone. He was sought for advice, or comfort, or simply for the peaceful presence which those who are resigned to enjoy what time they have left often carry. Of course after awhile it was only the latter that some came for. The faun's mind had slowed and his voice was raspy and easily tired. Those that ventured into the deep forest seeking the fabled old faun found his stories were few and often repeated, though they were the greatest stories of his life. Certainly they were not the happiest, nor the most exciting, but they were the most important memories he had, and it was a very, very long time until any of them faded from his mind. There was one girl, whose name who could never recall hearing, that came again and again and asked to hear the story of the princess he had waited for all those years. Even the faun's crusted eyes would open at the sound of the name of the one he had loved so dearly. A breath of spring in an age of winter, he called her with a creaking grin, for though age had made him sentimental, it had not dulled his humor. The little girl asked him how they had met, but he never spoke of that, as if there was nothing before those two had known one another. She never asked how the princess left the lands, but he told it every time. He did not speak of the joy of her rein, for there was none in all the lands who did not know it, nor did he speak of her marriage, who's joys he had not shared, except in the delight he found in the many children brought into the world by that union. Their names were some of the last to leave him, though in his mind their faces were still round with youth, even though most of them had already sired grandchildren by then. To him they remained the picture of childhood, bouncing on his knees, begging for stories and games in the gardens of eternal spring. Eventually there came a time when he could not open his misted eyes and cracked mouth to tell even these stories, though he whispered a name sometimes that sounded more like a sigh than the last pangs of a devotion that he kept him breathing for so many eons. A time came when the faun could no longer be distinguished from the roots of the great tree, if indeed he had not already become a part of them. His hooves split, his hands melted into the roots and his great round horns sunk into the depths of the bark, and the faun that had always been more tree than man finally returned to the great pillar that had spawned him. He did not die, but he did wither. Little piece by little piece he withered like the face of a mountain eroding back into the dirt. Seekers to the spot still felt him for ages after that, still heard his wispy chuckle in the wind, even after the roots ceased to resemble a vague sitting figure. In time, his face was forgotten, his name, and then his legend. He faded, like a star which had burned since the beginning, becoming dust in the black, he was gone. But he did not mind, for the faun had been dying for a long time, and once one dies, one can live once more, the dust from old stars forms new ones after all. Of course he was given a new name.

She had received a cheerleading-scholarship tonCal Saint Dominguez Hills and couldn't wait for the classes to begin. Okay,nI know Cliff won't be coming to my college, but who says I still can't havena little fun? thought Torrance, missing her rocker boyfriend. Oh well, Instill have my best bud Missy. As well as Missy, the rest of the old Rancho Carne crew had all gone tonSaint Dominguez. Unfortunately, so was Aaron. The former cheerleadernstarted picking up chicks as soon as he opened his car door. \"Hey hey heynladies! Wanna see my spirit stick?\" Oh my god, that is so Jan's line! Torrance thought, annoyed. Apart fromnthat whole 'hey hey hey' thing, though. Haha, poor girls. They so don'tnknow what is in store for them. Torrance smiled and giggled at the thoughtnof Aaron's cheating antics. \"Hey Torrance! Torr! Over here! TORRANCE!\" Turning, Torrance spied Missy, waving her arms wildly next to her gleamingnblue Beetle. \"Hey! Wassup, girl?\" Missy exclaimed as the two hugged andnslapped hands. \"Not much-just trying to get my head around the fact that my bro is goingnout with a cheerleader who's like, 3 years older than him!\" \"Oh, no way! You know, my bro's going out with a cheerleader too!\" \"Hey!\" laughed Torrance. \"At least I know I have some brains!\" \"Oh, that reminds me-Cliff wanted me to give this to you.\" Missy handednTorrance a little slip of paper. \"Oh, and these as well.\" Missy pulled anhuge bouquet of sweet smelling pink roses out of her car and placed then innTorrance's outstretched arms. \"Oh my god, that is so sweet! Give your bro a kiss from me, okay?\" \"Um, no. I think you can do that, Torr!\" Missy grinned slyly. \"Hehe, yeah.\" Said Torrance, envisaging herself kissing Cliff. \"Mmmmmmmmm.\" \"Hey, cut that out!\" Missy shook Torrance, waking her from her daydream andnshaking rose petals everywhere. \"Okay, okay! Lets see what this note says.\" Dear Torrance, Hey! I hope you like the roses-I especially picked them for you, evennthough I don't really know what your favourite flower is! Sorry…Anyway,njust wanted to tell you that I love you so much! Hehe…come back with Missynafter college to our house-I've got another surprise for you! Bye! Love with all my heart, 1 Cliff xxoo \"Oh! He is such a sweetie!\" a soppy smile plastered on her face, she heldnthe note against her chest. \"Yeah, alright Torr! Save the mush for my brother. Hey, there's Les andnJan!\" said Missy, spying two guys strolling up the footpath towards thencollege. \"Lets say hi!\" Pulling Torrance, Missy ran towards them, locking her car with a beep ofnher keys. \"LES! JAN!\" The two guys turned. Sure, one was Les, but the other was a cute blonde guynwith a baseball cap pulled low on his head. \"Hey Les! How are you? Who's your friend?\" asked Torrance, her and Missyngreeting Les. \"Hey guys! Um, this is Tim Romlen-I met him at Nationals last year.\" \"Hey! You must be Torrance and Missy! Les has told me all about you.\" saidnTim, flashing a killer smile and a look of his baby blue eyes, holding hisnhand out for a shake. \"Yeah…\" Torrance said dreamily, shaking his hand. \"Um, Torrance? I think Tim is Le's, you know, partner?\" whispered Missyninto her ear. \"Plus, you have a boyfriend!\" \"Oh my god, you're right!\" Torrance went bright red. \"Is something wrong?\" asked Tim, looking curiously at Torrance. \"No, no, she's fine! She just needs a drink, that's all!\" Missy thumpednTorrance on the back to make their story more believable. \"Er, we'll catchnup with you guys later in class, alright?\" said Missy quickly, leadingnTorrance away. \"Whoops…\" mumbled Torrance. \"Okay, there's Jan-you can stay here if you want, Torr. You don't want tonembarrass yourself again!\" \"No, it's okay.\" said Torrance, smoothing her intricate hairdo, and takingna deep breath. \"Lets go.\" \"Jan, my man, how are you?\" rapped out Missy, walking up to him, slappingnhands with him. \"Hey Miss! Torr, looking good! Um, this is my new girlfriend, Lina Meudar.nLina, this is Missy and Torrance.\" A buxom blonde stood next to Jan and glared at the two, contorting hernpretty features, which were slathered in makeup. \"That's her? Hoochie Mama Supreme?\" whispered Torrance to Missy, bothnlooking at her in secret disgust. \"U, okay, nice to meet you, Lina.\" smiled Missy, holding out her hand tonshake, a pang of jealousy running through her (Missy, what is wrong withnyou?! ) \"Excuse me? Zat would be Miss Meudar to you. I don't shake hands vith filthnlike you,\" said Lina in a strong French accent, looking disdainfully atnMissy's outstretched hand. \"Lina! Don't be so unfriendly! These are my friends!\" scolded Jan. \"Er, okay then.\" said Missy, withdrawing her hand and giving Jan theneyebrow (Oh, he is so cute! Missy, stop it!). \"Can I talk to you, Jan?\" \"Uh, sure Miss. What?\" Missy motioned for him to come closer. Jan camencloser. Missy grabbed Jan by the collar. \"What the HELL were you thinking, picking an French ho for a girlfriend? Inbet she's so stupid she can't even spell her own name!\" said Missynfuriously through gritted teeth. \"She's nice to me!\" whispered back Jan. \"Yeah, not 'cause she actually likes you! Use your brain, Einstein! She's anfrigging SLUT!\" \"Okay, okay! I'll see you later Miss-maybe you'll have calmed down bynthen!\" said Jan, gently pulling Missy's clenched fist off his shirt. \"Okay, what was that all about?\" Torrance asked Missy as they walked awaynfrom Jan and Lina and towards their classes. \"Nothing! I just can't believe Jan would go out with a girl like that!\" \"You like him, don't you Miss? You like Jan!\" Missy stopped and stared at Torrance. \"No, of course I don't! He's got angirlfriend.\" \"Missy, don't deny it! I know your quirks, your behaviour. You can tell me!nI know you like him.\" Torrance put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Alright, I do! But he'll never like me for more than a friend! He's soninto those slutty whore-type girls.\" \"You never know Missy, you never know.\" replied Torrance, putting her armnround Missy as they walked into class. Whitney and Courtney lined up for their lunch in the canteen line. It hadnbeen half a day and they still hadn't seen anyone they knew. Not that itnmattered anyway, 'cause all they were doing was picking up guys. Looking around slyly, Courtney slipped a plastic fork off her lunch traynand onto the floor. \"Whoops!\" she said, a hand covering her mouth. She bentnover and snapped her spankys, visible below her short cheerleading skirt,nmaking sure the brown-eyed babe behind had a clear view, then picked up hernfork. Whitney turned and rolled her eyes as Courtney straightened up. \"Courtney,nthat is so yesterday. You've been doing that spanky routine for over a yearnnow. I think you need a bit of variation.\" She flashed her pearly whites atnthe guy behind Courtney. He smiled back. Still smiling, Whitney raised hernhand over Courtney's shoulder towards the guy. \"Hey! I'm Whitney Dow. Andnyou are?\" \"Daniel Stevens. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, Whitney,\" he saidnwith a smile, taking her hand and kissing it. \"Ooh, I'm liking you already,\" purred Whitney. \"This is my friend, CourtneynEgbert.\" Glaring at Whitney, Courtney turned and pouted at Daniel, looking him upnand down. \"Nice.\" she said at him, glaring at Whitney one more time beforenstalking off. Finally, a guy all to myself! thought Whitney. \"So, you must be a cheerleader if you go here. What squad did you cheernfor?\" Whitney asked sweetly of Daniel. \"The East Compton Clovers.\" Whitney stood there with a shocked look on hernface. \"Yeah, I know what you're thinking, I'm white, why was I in the Clovers?nWell, I was one of the few in the squad-they always put me at the back,n'cause I was too conspicuous!\" laughed Daniel. \"Um, yeah.\" Whitney said with a little forced laugh, not thinking that atnall. \"Listen, I gotta go have some lunch, so maybe I'll see you round?\" \"Yeah, maybe.\" grinned Daniel. \"Okay then, later!\" Whitney ran off in Courtney's direction. A few minutes later, Casey entered the canteen. She spied her brother andnran up to him. \"Daniel! What are you doing? I thought I told you to meet menoutside ten minutes ago!\" \"Sorry, Case, but I got caught up.\" He stared dreamily at Whitney's back. \"WHITNEY!? You like WHITNEY!? Oh my god.\" Casey couldn't believe it. Out ofneveryone, her brother had to pick an airhead to have a crush on. \"You know her?\" \"Know her? She was in the Toros with me, Daniel!\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, oh. Well, I gotta go. Don't flirt with anyone else, okay?\" \"Yes Casey my sister dear.\" Outside the canteen on the lawn, Carver and Darcy sat. \"You know Carver, I can't believe how fit and thin you are now! All thatnyoga must have really paid off,\" Darcy said through mouthfuls of her lunch.n\"I guess you're all ready for Wolf Wall's now, eh?\" Carver nibbled on a celery stick and stretched out her slender, toned legs.n\"Yeah, no one can call me a cow now! I'll show Jan.\" \"Hey, about him, have you seen his girlfriend? She's like, total slutnmaterial.\" \"What, she's a cheerleader too?\" \"No, she's like a Penthouse cover-girl or something, met Jan through anmutual friend, so I heard. She came just this morning to see him off.\" \"Urgh, I hate sluts-though I can't say much more for Courtney and Whitneynthough.\" \"Yeah.\"giggled Darcy, and the two exchanged hi-fives, then sat down to eatnthe rest of their lunch. \"Missy!\" called Jan, motioning for her and Torrance to come over. \"Um, hey!\" she said, walking over with Torrance, who had a smirk on hernface. \"I'm all better now, don't worry.\" Missy said with a grin and a winknof an eye. \"Yeah, she took her medication.\" Torrance said evilly, grinning. \"Lina and I are having a party tonight-you guys wanna come? I've invitednpractically the whole crew.\" \"Yeah sure! We'd love to.\" \"Okay, great! So I'll see you girls at 6.00 pm my place!\" \"Or maybe earlier!\" called Missy to his retreating back, looking at itnwistfully. \"Miss, don't make it quite so obvious yet, girl!\" Torrance reminded hernbest bud. \"Oops…\"said Missy, smacking herself on the forehead. \"Don't stress! Lets just eat and forget about the whole thing.\" The two satndown to finish off their food.[Chapter 2] 1.1 Chapter 2 Sparky Polastri stepped out of his Volvo and took a deep breath. He wasnwearing a purple silk shirt open to reveal his hairy chest, a red andnyellow flamenco skirt, a turban on his head full of fruit, and those samenold leather lace-up boots. Walking into the college gymnasium, Sparky posed with a flourish of hisnhand. \"Here I am for my flamenco lessons!\" he said dramatically. The group inside warming up all stared open mouthed. \"Oh my god!\" \"What the hell?\" \"Freak alert!\" Sparky looked at the sea of astonished faces, and realised it was Monday,nnot Sunday. He whipped off his turban and flamenco skirt, revealing white silk pyjamanbottoms covered in pink polka dots. \"Oh crap! I forgot to change before I left! Oh well…um, class! I'm your newncheer teacher...Sparky Polastri. You may call me Mr. Polastri or Sir. Anynattempt to make a funny comment about my name, or call me Mr. P or Sparky,nI will pull your eyebrows off and feed them to your brain through yournnose!\" \"Isn't that Sparky Polastri?\" Casey dopily wondered. \"Well duh, when did you figure that out?\" retorted Courtney with a smirk. \"Who?\" Daniel was confused. How did all these girls know so many people henhad never heard of? \"Shut up Daniel.\" came back the reply of his younger sibling. Sparky made a feeble attempt to start the class. \"Shhhhhh, nononononono. Inam a teacher, that is what I am...\" \"I thought he was a choreographer,\" whispered Whitney to Courtney. \"…You, are cheerleaders. Cheerleaders are dancers, who have gone- \" \"Shut up already!\" Jan stood up to make his point. \"We've heard thisnbefore! We're not paying you, so cut the crap and say somethingndifferent!!!\" \"Did I tell you about my pet monkey Jo?\" asked Sparky of the class. They all stared with looks of disbelief, wondering where that obscurenquestion had come from. \"No, really! He's a great star on Broadway! Jo Monkeyman, they call him..\"nSparky went into a long detailed speech about his monkey's achievements,noblivious to the people around him. Darcy couldn't take anymore. What the hell is wrong with this moron? shenthought. I can't take it. He is getting out of here!!! Slowly, she crawlednaway from the group, and ran off to get someone of higher authority. \"…and once, he even had a guest role on ER! He had something like, a deadlynvirus or something which killed all the doctors…\" Sparky blabbed on, andnon, as his class struggled to keep awake. He didn't even notice when twonbig, burly guys came up behind him and dragged him away by the arms. A bignorange bottle containing many pills fell out of his pyjama pocket, followednby a large bottle of water. The men dragged him until he had disappearednfrom view. The former Toro squad breathed a sigh of relief as their arch-nemesisndisappeared. As soon as everyone was quiet, a slender redhead stood up and turned tonface the class. \"I'm taking control now-anyone who doesn't know me, I'm Roxy Jordan, I'mnlike, a veteran in cheering, so everyone split, and watch a master atnwork.\" Everyone looked at her with disgust. Courtney and Whitney exchanged dirtynlooks. \"She puts the ho in homosexual.\" Courtney muttered. \"Oh my god, Courtney!\" Whitney exclaimed. \"I can't believe you still saynthose lame jokes. They are so last year and so immature! Me, I put the me,nin Daniel!\" \"Oh, whatever! I can't believe you like that guy! He's like, Casey'snbrother!\" \"Oh what!? Oh my god, Casey? He's related to Casey? But he's so cute andnshe's like, eurgh!\" \"Oh my god guys! You are so mean! Casey's cool.\" chipped in Darcy, whoncouldn't help but stand up for her little friend. \"What?\" Casey asked dopily. Roxy stamped her foot and screwed her hands into fists. \"HELLO!? You're allnsupposed to be looking at me!\" Everyone stuck their finger up at Roxy, so the girl promptly sat down andnsulked, arms akimbo. \"Screw you, bitch.\" Missy said as she rolled her eyes. A familiar uglynredhead walked in. Roxy looked overjoyed. \"Oh look, it's my sister Bailey!nShe'll fix all of this! Hey Bailey, my class is dissing me!\" Missy raised an eyebrow. \"Your class? In your dreams, woman!\" \"And not even then!\" added Torrance, the two girls giving each other hi-nfives, grinning. \"Oh my god, its Big Bitch! I mean, hi!\" Darcy muttered(loud enough so thenformer Miss Red could hear.) Standing with her hands on her hips, Bailey spoke to them in that annoyingnvoice they all knew too well. \"Miss me? I'll teach you to screw the Regionals for me!\" \"Hello, it wasn't your squad anyway! I was captain!\" said Torrance angrily. \"Plus, it was like six months ago-get over it, hag!\" yelled Les, standingnup to emphasise his speech. Tim whispered into Les's ear. \"Who's that?\" Les replied, \"Be glad you don't know her, even though I'm sure you willnsoon.\" \"Right,\" commanded Bailey. \"Get off your lazy butts, I want to see you guysndo a Wolf's Wall!\" \"What makes you the boss of us?\" Carver whispered, annoyed. \"What's a Wolf's Wall?\" asked Roxy, dopily. \"Oh jeez, even I know now!\" said Casey, exasperated. Bailey sneered. \"You are so stupid, Roxy! How'd you even get into thisncollege with a brain like yours? I want to see you on top of the Wolf'snWall, NOW!\" Everyone got into position to attempt the pyramid. \"Do I look like a milkmaid, 'cause someone feels like a cow, and I know itsnnot Carver this time!\" shouted Jan, struggling to hold up Roxy, Lesnlaughing at the old memory. \"Excuse me?!\" Roxy said indignantly, wobbling as she lost focus. \"Concentrate, you cow!\" yelled Jan. But it was too late. Roxy lost balance,ndestroying the pyramid on her way down. She landed with a thump on top ofnDaniel. \"Why, hello!\" she said with a flirtatious smile, undressing him with herneyes. Daniel freaked and backed away. Roxy turned to see her sister glaring down at her. \"Roxy, I knew you shouldn't have eaten all those Tim Tams before we left!nDrop and give me fifty!\" Everyone smirked as Roxy warily got down andnstarted the push ups, struggling by four. Torrance and Missy walked back to Missy's Beetle. It had been a long daynand they couldn't wait to get away from the Cal State Dominguez Hills. \"I wonder what that surprise Cliff has for me is.\" Torrance wondered. \"You'll see.\" Missy said with a grin. Suddenly they saw Lina, stepping outnof her yellow convertible. \"Quick! Hide!\" hissed Missy, pulling Torrancendown behind a bush with her. \"I want to see what will happen.\" Torrancennodded in acknowledgement. Jan walked out of the college slowly. But when he saw his girlfriend, hisneyes lit up and he ran over to her to give her a big hug. But Lina hadnother things in mind. She flung her arms around Jan and promptly begannkissing him passionately, whilst squeezing his butt. Still kissing, Linanpushed him against the bonnet of a car unbuttoning his shirt.nUnfortunately, this was Missy's precious Beetle. Torrance almost puked atnthe sight, bile rising in her throat, while Missy had just seen enough. Standing up, she walked out of her hiding place and unlocked the car. Thenbeep startled the two, and they looked around, bewildered. Missy made anshooing motion with her hands. \"Okay guys, shows over. Why don't you two get a room or something?\" Lina sneered. \"Vot?\" Missy rolled her eyes. \"For real, I wanna go home! So back off before Inleave tyre marks all over your pretty face!\" Lina glared and pulled Jan towards her convertible. Rolling their eyes yetnagain, Missy and Torrance got into the Beetle. \"She is such a slut.,\" muttered Missy as she started the ignition.[Chapter 3] Missy and Torrance pulled up at Miss's house. Cliff was waiting excitedlynat the door, a huge grin plastered on his face and a small velvet box innhis hand. Torrance whispered to Missy, casting a sidelong glance towardsnthe box. \"Is that what I think it is?\" Missy shook her head warily. \"Don't get your hopes up, Torr. My brother hasnno intention of proposing, as far as I know.\" She locked the car and walked slowly up the stone steps, while Torrancendashed into Cliff's outstretched arms. He picked her up and twirled hernaround, giving her a big kiss. Torrance jumped down and grabbed the boxneagerly. \"Is this the surprise?\" \"Well, yeah.\" Cliff said sheepishly. \"I know it's not that much, but Inwanted you over here anyway.\" Torrance's heart rose in anticipation as she slowly opened the box, holdingnher breath. Inside was a gleaming silver ID bracelet. \"Oh, its beautiful!\"nbreathed Torrance, turning it over to read the inscription out loud. \"To my dear Torrance, you're just what I need! Love always, Cliff-thanksnCliff! I love you so much!\" exclaimed Torrance, giving her boy a kiss onnthe cheek. Missy walked over to them, a look of realisation on her face. \"Oh my god! Jan and his bitch's party is in only 2 hours! We have to getnready!\" \"Do you wanna come, Cliff? I'm sure Jan wouldn't mind-though I'm not surenabout Lina!\" Cliff pretended to think about it. \"Yeah, sure!\" he said, a smile spreadingnon his face. The Pantone's front door opened, and the two best friends stepped out,ntotally transformed. Missy wore dark denim hipster flares, rhinestone beltnslung low. A midriff peasant blouse exposed her toned stomach and bellynring. Chunky black platforms covered her feet, and a delicate silver chainnadorned her neck. Torrance was equally gorgeous in an off-the-shoulder black blouse, studdednred mini and strappy black heels. A red rose choker encircled her neck, hernnew silver bracelet on her wrist. Both girls hair were in sexy, touslednupdos, their make-up immaculate. Cliff leant on the Beetle, waiting in a simple white shirt and baggy army-nfatigue pants, 'The Clash' embroidered on one pocket. He grinned and wolf-nwhistled in approval. Cliff, Missy and Torrance arrived at Jan's house, half an hour earlier thannthe set time. They walked across the huge green lawn to the front door, andnrang the bell. Lina answered the door, dressed like a playboy bunny. Shenwas wearing a black semi-transparent halter split down to the navel, anblack bow tie and silver hotpants. Bunny ears sat atop her head and blacknknee-high f**k me boots covered her large feet. Torrance whispered in disgust to her friends. \"Is this what she wears tonparties?\" \"Jan, your loser friends are here!\" yelled Lina, turning her head so hernwords could be more clearly heard. \"Nice to see you too!\" sneered Missy to Lina's turned head. Lina snappednher head back and gazed provocatively at the new bait, Cliff. Cliff stucknher finger up at her, Miss and Torr giggling. Lina glared and stormed off,npushing past Jan as he approached his guests. Cliff pulled his sister andngirlfriend in to face Jan. Missy's heart leapt, as he looked particularlynfine that night in an open-necked checked shirt and blue baggy skaternjeans. \"Missy, you're looking particularly fine tonight.\" Jan said with a grin.nMissy blinked as she had a feeling of déjà vu. \"Oh, and you too, Torrance!\" Missy's eyes glazed over as she began to fantasise…Torrance saw this, andnpromptly but discreetly poked her in the back, releasing her from herntrance. \"Um, thanks Jan!\" said Torrance quickly for the both of them. \"Come on! There's a long night of partying to come! Oh and Cliff, I've gotna sufficient supply of Clash records which we can play tonight.\" Jannmotioned for his guests to follow him through his huge furnished housentowards the back yard. Cliff clasped his hands together. \"Thankyou!\" henwhispered upwards. Jan's backyard was a dream. It was covered in glittering coloured lights,nthe large fountain in the middle glowing as light reflected off it. Anmakeshift dance floor was made on top of the huge pool, a sheet of strongnclear Perspex placed on top, hundreds of lit coloured candles floatingnunder it. \"Don't worry, the Perspex can hold you all without breaking. We tested annelephant on it this afternoon!\" Jan said, grinning at Missy. \"It'snabsolutely beautiful.\" Missy breathed, astonished how different Jan'snbackyard was to its usual. \"Okay people, this party can not go wrong-or so I hope! The food table isnover here, and the drinks table is over there.\" Jan pointed to three hugentables, covered in white tablecloths. \" I hired a DJ, who is over there.nAsk him to play whatever-the guy is a genius! Just mingle and enjoyntonight!\" Jan turned and walked back inside his house to give hisngirlfriend some support (for what, Jan didn't know.) Torrance saw Missy's miserable look and gave her a reassuring hug. \" Comenon, Miss! There's no point trying to catch his attention all night, whennhe's preoccupied with her!\" Missy gave in reluctantly and walked over tonthe food table for some munchies. Jan came back outside, Lina behind him,nstill glaring at Cliff. Who are those guys? Missy wondered as three guys she had never seen beforenwalked through the door. \"Hey Jan! Who are your friends?\" she shouted tonJan, pointing, catching his and the other three guys' attention. \"Miss, don't you know it is rude to point? This is Josh Ryan, Jesus James,nGordon Savvy,\" said Jan, introducing the guys in turn. \"Guys, meet MissynPantone, one of my best buddies ever.\" Jan squeezed Missy tight as shengrinned. \"Apart from Les, that is, and here he is now!\" Les and Tim walked in and greeted Jan, slapping hands. Les went over tonTorrance and Missy and gave them each big hugs. \"Hey guys! How are you doing? And who's the friend, Torr?\" \"Hey! This is my boyfriend Cliff. He's also Miss's bro.\" Cliff smiled andnshook hands with Les. Les grinned. \"Ooh, family relations!\" Soon Casey and Daniel arrived, followed closely by Courtney and Whitney.nWhitney gazed and Daniel's retreating ass, smiling to herself. Seeing Jan'snfriends as fresh meat, Courtney tried to entice them with her usual spankynroutine. All three guys fell for it, totally under her spell, doingnwhatever she wanted them to. \"…and, can you carry me over here? Thanksnguys, you are all such sweeties!\" Music started, and the DJ added a funky beat to Mandy Moore's 'I Wanna BenWith You', which everyone could dance to. Cliff took Torrance's hand andnled her onto the makeshift dance floor, and the two danced the night away.nSeeing this, Whitney shyly walked over to Daniel. \"Hey, um Daniel! I don't suppose you want to dance with me?\" Daniel smiled as he obliged. \"Sure, why not? I'd love to.\" He pullednWhitney to the dance floor, leaving Casey all alone. Leering, Josh camenover to her. \"Are you wearing spanky pants?\" he asked, looking her up and down. Caseyndecided he had a few too many to drink, and shook her head. \"Aah, no. Younsee, I get changed after school.\" Josh looked disappointed and walked backnto Courtney, who was being fed grapes by the other two love-struck boys. Casey was all alone again, and a little tear slid down her cheek as shenwatched everyone else having fun. Les saw how forlorn and lost Caseynlooked, and took pity on her. Pulling Tim with him, he ran over to her. \"Come on Case, it takes three to tango! Lets dance!\" Casey grinned as allnthree walked over to the pool, all her previous hang-ups gone. While Jan's friends took toilet breaks, Courtney decided to make things anlittle more interesting. Walking over to the preoccupied DJ, she bent overnand snapped her spankys. The DJ gawked and stared, his gaze transfixed onnCourtney's rear end. Whitney heard the snap, and looked over. Motioning fornDaniel to stay put, she walked over to Courtney and tapped her on thenshoulder. \"Courtney, why are you still wearing your cheerleading skirt?\" Courtney faltered as she failed to think of a good answer. \"Er, well, I,num, didn't have time to…\" Whitney looked sympathetically at her friend. \"Was it laundry day today,nCourtney?\" she asked gently. Courtney looked down at her feet and mumblednquietly, \"Yes.\" Whitney gave Courtney a hug in hope to make her feel better. Josh, Jesusnand Gordon made their way over to Courtney again, carrying huge feathernfans and a velvet settee. \"We'll take it from here, Whitney,\" Gordon informed her. \"Where did you get those exotic items from, Gordon?\" Whitney asked, anninquisitive look on her face. Gordon shrugged. \"We found them in the roomnunder the stairs. There's lots more items like these.\" Jesus added with a grin, \"We reckon Jan went through a Cleopatra phase,nwhat with all those jewelled headdresses down there!\" Whitney giggled and ran off towards Daniel. Carver ran in, looking sexy butnflustered in a sparkly blue boob tube and white mini. \"Whew! Sorry I'm late, Jan! My car broke down so I had to run all the waynhere!\" Gordon and Jesus looked on admiringly. \"Hello, and who might you be?\" askednJesus. Carver looked down shyly (no guy had ever noticed her before!). \"M-my namenis Katie Carver, but all my friends just address me by my last name.\" Gordon licked his lips. \"Have you seen this fabulous dance floor yet,nCarver?\" he asked her softly as he and Jesus led her away. Courtney stifled a shriek as the previous Miss Lard-face of the squad stolentwo of her man-servants. Josh saw her face, ready to crumple into tears,nand put an arm around her. \"Don't worry, Courtie! I'm still here for you.\" Courtney looked into Josh's big chocolate brown eyes, and pulled him closenfor a hug, tears of happiness running down her face, feelings of insecurityndisappearing. A dark-haired beauty and a blond Adonis entered the backyard, the blondnlooking slightly nervous. Darcy called out to Jan, who was dancingnextremely close with Lina. \"Jan! Hi! I'm late, duh, because of my friend here. Jan, this is mynneighbour, Jay Warner. Do you remember him?\" A blank look came over Jan'snface. \"I, um, tried out for your squad last year?\" Jay prompted him. \"Oh, now I know who you are!\" Jan broke out into a silly grin. \"Well,nwhatever man, like they say, the more the merrier!\" 'Yeah, ok, ok. Anyway, I was just explaining why I came so late, 'causenJay's so shy, it took me AGES to convince him!\" Darcy lightly smacked Jaynacross the head. He smiled and rubbed his head gently. Meanwhile Les looked to see who the newcomers were. \"Isn't that the balletnguy from tryouts last year? I think his name was Jay, or something.\" Tim looked up from his half eaten chicken salad. \"What?\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Roxy and Bailey stalked in, both wearing reflective silver Oakleys. Baileynwore a black leather shirtdress zipped right down to reveal her pumped upnsilver Wonderbra. Roxy was a fashion disaster, as she tried to copy hernsister's 'perfect' style. She wore a black leather waistcoat unbuttoned,nonly a silver bandeau underneath, and a white plaid skirt. \"Oh look! It's the invasion of the Bitches from Outer Space!\" Missy callednout in the sister's direction. Lowering her Oakleys, Bailey replied withnmalice, \" You're just jealous that you don't have the rack that I have,nloser! All the men want me.\" In one swift movement, she grabbed the sidesnof her jacket, pulled them apart, and ran a licked finger down herncleavage. \"Oh jeez,\" Missy shuddered and turned away. \"I really, really didn't neednto see that, really I didn't. I mean, that was such a pathetic comeback.\"nTorrance and Cliff sniggered. Jan came up to greet the guests. \"Hey Big Red!\" Bailey turned and stared Jan in the eye. With lightning quick hands, shengrabbed his jaw and squeezed it tight in her hand. \"Don't even THINK aboutncalling me that! That is so last year. The name is BAILEY.\" There were groaning sounds and shrieks of pleasure coming from behind anlarge tree on the far side of Jan's yard. People moved closer to it,ncurious. Lina quickly appeared from behind it, zipping up her hotpants andnholding a long clear tubular object behind her back. Flushing, she said inna rush, \"Just had a qvick toilet break zat's all!\" Everyone, of course realised what Lina had really been doing, all smilednweakly and rushed to the nearest bush to puke. Jan shook his head slowlynand walked inside to get an aspirin. Roxy hadn't even noticed what had just happened, and felt that she wasn'tngetting enough attention. Running over to Lina, she gave her a huge shove.n\"You think you're some kind of playboy bunny? Get a life, 'cause you're toonf**king fat, girl!\" Lina's mouth was wide open in shock, and she shoved Roxy back. \"Vot?! Shutnup, you…you…stick!\" Roxy smirked and placed her hands at her hips. \"Oh yeah, real goodncomeback, there, bitch!\" Infuriated, Lina raised her hand and gave Roxy a stinging slap across thenface, leaving a red handprint. Pulling each other's hair and spitting inneach other's faces, the two girls fought and rolled across the grass.nSeeing what was happening, Jan ran out of the house to stop the catfight,nbut was too late. \"STOP!\" he yelled. His shouts in vain, the girls rollednbetween a small gap in the pool's Perspex dance floor and fell in. Dancer's watched on as the two thrashed under the plastic, unable to getnout. Jan covered his eyes in embarrassment, and then walked back inside fornanother aspirin. Ten minutes later, Jan came back out and decided to break the tensenatmosphere of the night with a speech. Taking a glass of bubbly from thennearest table, he climbed up onto the edge of the fountain to be morenclearly seen. \"I'd like to propose a toast to everyone for making it through the first,nstressful, day of college. Thanks for being here, so just-WHOA!\" Jannslipped and fell, banging his head on the side of the fountain on the wayndown, and fell in with big splash. There was a hush as people looked innhorror. Bailey stifled a giggle, while Roxy just let it all out.n\"HAHAHAHAHAHA!\" she guffawed, crawling out of the pool, wearing then'drowned rat' look. People glared daggers at the dumb girl. Missy became really worried and ran over to Jan, coughing and splutteringnin the fountain. She pulled him out and helped him to stand, blotting thensmall bloody gash that had appeared on his head with a tissue from her jeannpocket. \"Are you okay? Jan? Do you need anything?\" Lina rolled out from under the Perspex and strutted over to Jan, soakingnwet. She pushed Missy out of the way. \"Piss off, bitch! He's my man and only I know what he vants!\" Linanproceeded to kiss Jan passionately. Jan gasped and turned beetroot red fromnlack of oxygen, yells muffled by Lina's huge lips. Missy pushed Lina away,nfuming. \"You idiot! You almost suffocated him, you LOSER! Don't you knownANYTHING!?\" \" Fine then! I'll just make out vith another guy then!\" Lina ran up tonJan's clique and gave them a tongue thrashing French kiss one after anothern(Ewww, what a slut! thought Torrance and Missy, their thoughts alike). Eachnguy yelled or Courtney before Lina muffled their shouts, slobbering allnover their chins (Again, Torrance and Missy both thought Ewwwww, what andog!). Seething with rage, Courtney silently walked up behind Lina, pulled hernhead back by the hair and punched her in the nose \"Bitch!\" Courtney yelled.nBlood pouring from her face, Lina screamed back at her. \"You broke my nose,nyou f**king vhore! Now I'll have to get it done again!\" Courtney plastered a look of fake sympathy on her face as she walked away.n\"Awww. You better watch the language, bitch, this is a children's show.\"nRoxy gasped, eyes wide, then crossed her arms, sulking. Les, seeing Jan's depressed look, decided it was time to part. \"Okay,npeople's party's over! Move off to your own homes and we'll seeyantomorrow!! Come on Tim. Hey Jan, sorry about what happened, man. Don'tnworry. Hey, I gotta go, 'cause Tim's ma doesn't want him out past hisnbedtime.\" Tim grinned. \"Nah man, my mum's cool about stuff like that. He's justnplayin'. Anyway, let's roll, Les. Catch ya later peoples!\" Cliff and Torrance, stepped off the dancefloor. They'd been dancing allnnight, almost totally oblivious to the world around them. Torrance wasnsleeping over at Missy's, and she couldn't wait to get back to their place.nShe shivered from the night's cold air, so Cliff took off his corduroynjacket and placed it around her shoulders. Torrance smiled at himngratefully. Missy called over to the two lovebirds. \"Hey, I'll just talk to Jan for anwhile, okay?\" Torrance called back, \"Hey, no problem! We'll wait for younoutside.\" Torrance and Cliff walked out to the car, hand in hand. \"How 'bout you stay over tonight?\" Cliff asked. \"Yeah, sure.\" came thenreply. \"My parents are at some function thingy and Justin is preoccupiednwith his ditzy cheerleader girlfriend. You know, I can't believe I haven'tnmet her yet!\" \"I wouldn't call all cheerleaders ditzy.\" Cliff said, smiling. Torrancengrinned and kissed him, putting her arms round his waist. Missy strode over to Jan, hoping to cheer up the poor guy before sayingngoodnight. As she came closer to him cleaning up the mess, she saw his eyesnwere red, tears dripping down his face. He sniffed and when saw Missy,nquickly wiped away the tears and attempted a weak smile. Missy gasped andnran over to him, a concerned look on her face. \" Jan, what's wrong?\" Jan tried to keep the even look on his face, beforenbursting into tears again. Missy hugged him close (I can't believe I'mnactually doing this!), and listened to what he has to say. \"Lina broke up with me. She said…\" **Flashback** Lina stood in front of Jan, hands on hip. She sighed then patted Jan on hernshoulder. Jan smiled. \"What is it, sweetie?\" Taking a deep breath, Linansmoothed back her hair and began to talk. \"Look, Janny, zere's better guysnout there vor moi. You're just not mon type. And vot ze 'ell is vith yournfriends?!\" **Flashforward ** Missy gasped, then wiped away his tears with her finger, trying to comfortnthe distressed guy. \"Oh my god! I'm so sorry! There are much better girlsnfor you-she doesn't deserve such a terrific guy like you.\" She pulled out of Jan's embrace to face him. \"I just want to say that nonmatter what, I'll always be there for you, same with Les, and Torrance, andneveryone else.\" Salty tears dripped onto her shoulder as Jan hugged her tightly, his headnclose to her neck. As they pulled away, Jan spoke to her, a small smile onnhis face. \"You are too sweet, Miss.\" She smiled then patted him on the shoulder. \"Well, I'd better go home now.nCliff and Torrance are waiting. I'll see ya at school tomorrow, okay?\" Jannweakly smiled. \"Yeah.\" He put his hand on her shoulder, and then leaned forward to kissnMissy softly on her cheek. \"Good night.\" Missy came out of Jan's front door then shut it behind her. She grinned innawe. \"Wow.\" She whispered, and then walked to her Beetle.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 The next morning, Torrance and Missy entered the gymnasium, ready for theirngymnastics class, first period. Torrance groaned, putting her hand to hernhead. \"I know I didn't have any alcohol last night, but I swear I have anhangover or something! My head kills.\" Missy giggled. \"Must be Jan's world famous punch.\" Four familiar faces appeared in the gym door. Smiling, the two girlsnrecognised the former Clovers. Torrance greeted them with a wave. \"HeynIsis! What took you so long to get here? The first day was yesterday, younknow.\" Isis laughed. \"Hey Torrance! We're just being 'fashionably late', you knownwhat I'm saying?\" an innocent look pasted on her face. \"Nah girl, we were just chillin-came back from our Paris holiday justnyesterday, baby!\" Jenelope confirmed. Missy came up, having finished her warm-up routine. \"Wow, so you guysnreally have had time to rest and re-cooperate for the new year! How wasnParis?\" Lava licked her lips. \"Oh man, it was so good! I tell you, French food isnda bomb, eh LaFred?\" LaFred grinned. \"Mm-mmm! But the boys and shopping wasnthe real highlight!\" All six girls laughed and hugged, despite last year's tension between them.nMeanwhile, Daniel walked in, holding Whitney's hand, Casey by his othernside. Noticing the new arrivals, LaFred broke out of her hug with Torrance.n\"Ooh baby! Who's that foxy stud?\" she said, licking her lips as she eyednoff Daniel. Torrance rolled her eyes. \"LaFred, don't even think about it!nDaniel is Whitney's property.\" \"Can't a girl just admire the talent round here?\" she said innocently, eyesnwide, a smile playing on her lips. The eight girls and Daniel sat down on the wooden floor to wait, stretchingnto occupy their time. Hearing the gym door creak open, they all stoppednstretching, and looked to see who had come. A middle-aged woman with longnflowing blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail streamed in. On the waynover, she executed a perfect hands-free cartwheel, followed by a faultlessnfront-spring. Everyone stood up, clapped and cheered, utterly surprised bynthe woman's unexpected display of gymnastics. The woman smiled and motionednfor everyone to sit. \"Thankyou. Class, I am your new teacher, Mrs Gretel Darlsen. I will bentaking you through this year for gymnastics, and I assure you, you will benabsolutely stunning by the end of it! Why are there only nine of you?\" Daniel smiled. \"Oh don't worry, Mrs Darlsen. There should be plenty morencoming.\" \"Ooh, baby, he is so hot!\" LaFred whispered to no one in particular, andnfanned herself. At that moment Courtney, Tim and Les walked in. Mrs Darlsen turned round tonsee who the newcomers were, and Courtney gasped. \"Mom!?\", before promptlynfainting. Tim and Les caught her before she hit the floor, while MrsnDarlsen ran over. \"Courtney? My daughter? Oh my Lord!\" She kneeled down to Courtney's side asntears dripped down her cheeks. \"I haven't seen you for years.\" shenwhispered, brushing Courtney's hair off her face. Whitney clapped her hand to her mouth in shock. \"Courtney's mom? Oh my god!nShe was searching for her everywhere!\" \"Class dismissed!\" Mrs Darlsen yelled, before leading Courtney out of thenroom. Everyone looked at each other in bewilderment, before standing up andnwalking outside. And what the hell was that all about? wondered Jenelope. Jan looked at his class slowly approaching him, probably about to yell atnhim for being so late to class. Looking at Missy, as she laughed atnsomething Torrance said, Jan thought to himself, I never realised hownbeautiful Miss is. Those chocolate brown eyes twinkling, her beautifulnsmile lighting up her angelic face-am I falling in love with one of my bestnfriends? Just then Missy turned her head towards Jan, and caught himnstaring at her. Missy felt herself go red. Why is he staring at me likenthat? I love his gorgeous hazel eyes. Thinking nothing of it, she shook itnoff and called out to him. \"Jan! Hey! Are you feeling better from lastnnight?\" Once she reached him, she put her hand on his shoulder, and smiled. \"Jan! Hey! Are you feeling better from last night?\" she asked softly. Janncould feel the heat rising in his cheeks, so he quickly coughed and turnednaway. \"Yeah, I um, I'm fine. I gotta go get a drink, so I'll catch you guysnlater. See ya!\" Jan ran off towards the drinking taps. \"We still have 20 minutes until our next class, so meet us outside thenmusic building, okay?\" yelled Missy to his turned back. \"Yeah!\" he replied, over his shoulder. Confused with what had justnhappened, Isis turned to Torrance for an answer. \"Okay, what was thatnabout?\" Torrance smiled and shook her head. \"Nothing. Its just nothing.\" Finally reaching the taps, Jan leaned down on them to catch his breath.nSince the kiss last night, all he could think of was Missy. Every time henclosed his eyes an image of Missy's pretty face would fill his view. She'sngot everything, he thought. A wonderful personality, moves to rival anynOlympic gymnast, and a head full of brains. To top it off, she's got thenhottest bod I've ever seen! He grinned to himself as the last thoughtsnflitted across his mind. Sliding down against the tap's adjacent brick wall, Jan tried to comprehendnwhat this all meant. He had dated many girls, but he hadn't felt like thisnabout any one of them. Not even the great Lina. Although he did miss her,nJan realised that Lina just wanted his body, and he went a lot deeper thannthat. Does this mean Missy's the one for me? He wondered, sighing. Jan began to get up, ready to return to his class. Not looking, he bangednhis head on the side of the drinking tap. \"Shit.\" He muttered, clutching his head as he stumbled off. Walking into the gym, Roxy slammed the double doors open with two hands,nhoping to make a lasting impression on the new teacher. Unfortunately,nthere wasn't a soul in sight. Aghast, Roxy stomped her feet and screamed.n\"What the f**k!? Where is everyone?\" Fuming, she paced around, a frownnetched on her face. \"This is just ruining my day! NO ONE got to see myngrand entrance!\" Meanwhile, outside the music building, the rest of the '01 class hadnarrived. Carver's face twitched, as if she just heard something horrible.n\"Get over it, Roxy!\" she snapped. Everyone looked at her, confused. \"Wherendid that come from?\" asked Whitney, raising an eyebrow. Carver lookednsurprised and shrugged. \"I have no idea.\" Back at the gym, Roxy was almost tearing her hair out, wondering why no onenhad arrived yet. \"Oh my god! I just hope my boyfriend can make it betterntonight when I come over! And apparently he's got a real bitch of a sister-nhopefully she's not as bad as those losers Torrance and Missy! She thoughtnto herself. Frowning, Roxy turned and ran out of the gym. Carver adjusted her fitted jumper, just as her face twitched again. A smirknappeared on her face, as she appeared to be talking to no one innparticular. \"Oh yeah, like you would have a boyfriend. He probably justndates you out of pity.\" she sneered, flicking her hair. Again, Whitneynlooked at her curiously. \"Are you alright, Carver?\" she asked. \"I…I…I don'tnthink so,\" Carver stammered, looking slightly pale. Meanwhile, LaFred was trying to seduce Daniel, but in vain. \"So, what arenyou doing Friday night, big boy?\" she said huskily, running her tonguenaround her mouth seductively. Daniel gulped and looked around franticallynfor a way out. \"Er, I'm er-um,\" \"My boyfriend, thankyou LaFred! Get your own.\" Whitney told LaFred firmly,nsaving Daniel in the nick of time. Daniel looked at her in surprise, at hisnnew label of 'boyfriend'. LaFred pouted and ran off to talk to Jenelope andnLava.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 The bell rang as the class walked into the music room. Walking in, Torrancenand Missy looked to see a very familiar person, standing in front of thenclass, guitar around his neck. \"Cliff!\" both girls exclaimed. \"What are you doing here?\" Torrance asked, ansurprised grin curved on her lips. Cliff grinned and strummed a jammin'nriff on his guitar. \"I teach music here every Tuesday. I wanted to surprise so I waited forntoday to tell you!\" Torrance smiled, then leaned in to give Cliff a quicknkiss on the lips. Once she pulled back, she turned to Missy and gave her anplayful shove on her shoulder. \"Why didn't you tell me, Miss!?\" \"I swear, I didn't know!\" Missy put up her hands in defence, laughing. Suddenly there was a huge bang and everyone turned round to see what hadnhappened. Roxy burst into the classroom, slamming the door open, in thenmeanwhile squashing a certain red-headed student against the wall, who wasnpreviously conversing with Darcy and Casey, who rolled their eyes at thenantics of Roxy. Prancing over to the tables, she placed her books next tonDaniel, Whitney and LaFred both glaring daggers at her. Carver staggered out from behind the door, and went over to where Roxy wasnstanding. \"You bitch!\" she screamed, driving a hard punch into Roxy'snstomach. Cliff and the rest of the class cracked up and took their seats asnRoxy doubled over, tears welling in her eyes from pain. \"Well, kick-boxing must have finally paid off.\" smirked Carver. Cliff raised his hands for silence, and began to introduce himself. \"Okayneveryone, I'm your Tuesday music teacher for the rest of the year. For allnthose who don't know me, my name is Cliff Pantone.\" Pointing to Missy, he continued. \"Also, this lovely lady's brother. And I'mnsorry to tell you this, but although I may be the same age as most of you,nI still have complete, utter power and authority over you, because I amnconsidered to be the rank of teacher.\" Flashing a quick smile, Cliff gotndown to business. \"As I understand, your cheer squad try-outs are coming up and you all arenexpected to choreograph your own cheers. And of course, you need some kindnof musical understanding to accomplish that, right? So today, as a niceneasy start to the year, we are gonna do the DJ thang, and mix your ownnmusic! The uni has kindly bought me 8 MixMaster 3000 turntables for thisntask, so unfortunately for you (Cliff put on a look of fake pity), y'allnhave to share. Pair up into threes, please. Torrance?\" The class scurried to partner up. Hearing her name, Torrance walked over tonher boyfriend. Missy stood alone as her best friend was partnered. Seeingnhis chance, Jan grabbed it. \"Hey Miss, you wanna go with me?\" he asked her,na smile on his face. Missy's heart thudded to a halt. He wants me to gonwith him? Woohoo! \"Yeah, sure thing, Jan!\" Whitney and Daniel, and Casey, Carver and Darcynwere the obvious pairs, straightaway choosing each other. LaFred bounded up to their table. \"Yo wassup Danny baby can I go with you?\" Daniel turned red and looked down. Whitney saw her man's embarrassed facenand filled the empty silence for him. \"Whatever, if we have to,\" shenreplied, a bored look on her face. \"But just remember, girl, I come withnthe package, understand?\" LaFred growled and forced a smile. \"Yeah, cool!\" Turning her eyes (hern'bedroom eyes') back to her target, she blew an air-kiss seductively,nflicking her tongue out of her mouth before turning to retrieve a turntablenfrom the from of the lecture room. Daniel exhaled, and attempted to loosen his shirt collar, but then realisednit was already open. Whitney gritted her teeth in anger and sent ESP deathnmessages to LaFred's turned back. While everyone had chosen their pairs, Courtney stood in the middle of itnall, back from her quick rendezvous with her mother. Thinking that Roxy wasnthe only other person left, she clenched her fist and swore under hernbreath, frustrated, and closed her eyes to calm herself. Opening them, shenspotted Les and Tim, and breathed a sigh of relief. Seeing her, Timnwhispered something quickly to Les, who nodded in agreement. They thennparted, and Tim walked over to Courtney and Roxy, while Les joined Torrancenand Cliff. Courtney lifted her eyes to the sky. \"Thank god!\" she mutterednto herself. Pushing Courtney away, Roxy stalked over to the turntable and waved hernhands over it. What the hell is she doing? Trying to be some lame-assnmagician? Thought Courtney with disgust. Clearing her throat, Roxy spoke, anpain to the ears, as always. \"Okay, I'm like, a pro at mixing music, so- \" \"Oh, shut up!\" snapped Courtney, arms crossed over her chest. \"Can younlike, get over yourself for once and give someone else a shot?\" Roxy glarednat Courtney, then turned to smile at Tim. \"Timmy!\" Roxy purred, her voicendripping with honey. Tim raised an eyebrow. \"Don't call me that.\" Roxy paused, and tried again, sidling closer to him. \"Tim! You wouldn'tnmind me going first, would you? I mean, I would give you such a headnstart.\" Rolling his eyes, Tim exhaled heavily. \"Roxy, the only way you could givenus a head start is if we ditched you. But, seeing as we can't do that, shutnup and take the back seat for a while, okay?\" Roxy looked at Tim in horror,nher mouth hanging open from shock. \"And don't you have somewhere else tonbe? You're cramping my private space.\" Face still frozen in her shocked expression, Roxy slowly backed away fromnTim, and Courtney. \"They don't want me, they don't want me,\" she saidnslowly, loud enough for the other two to hear by accident. \"No, no, it-itncan't be-EVERYBODY WANTS ME!\" Her last sentence rose into a maniacalnscream, as Roxy tugged at her hair and ran screaming from the room. Tim turned to Courtney, after the class had resumed what they were doing,nafter all staring at bewilderment at the whacked-out Roxy. \"Was itnsomething I said?\" The two burst out laughing and hi-fived, walking up tonthe front of the music room to collect their music samples. Missy and Jan leafed through the huge collection of music, trying to findnthe perfect sample. Sniggering, Jan held up a CD single for Missy to see.n\"'Tell me how you feel' by Joy Enriquez-jeez, I didn't know cliff likednanything that didn't include guitars! Has he a secret feminine side?\"nSmiling, Missy took the CD. \"Jan, you silly boy! This is from myncollection,\" indicating towards the CD. \"I just like a sweet feel-good songnonce in a while.\" Jan grinned. \"Aww.\" \"Hey!\" protested Missy, playfully punching Jan's arm. Suddenly Jan pulled ansingle out of the collection, eyes wide. \"Oh my god! I have been lookingneverywhere for this song! Missy, we are definitely using this for thensecond sample!\" He turned the CD cover round so Missy could see it. It wasn'First Date' by Blink 182. \"Yeah, whatever.\" She replied, eyes wide. Is this a sign? Will we go on anfirst date? Damn, I hope so! For the next 20 minutes each group worked together to create the coolestnmixes they could from their chosen samples. Cliff then chose the bestnsamples to play out to the class. \"Okay people! Listen up. It was a hardndecision, but I've finally come up with the two best mixes. They are-drumnroll please-'First Date' by Missy and Jan, and 'Butterfly' by Casey, Carvernand Darcy.\" The winners all hugged and hi-fived, and all crowded round thenfront to hear the selected mixed samples. People leaned forward as thenfirst sounds of Missy and Jan's mix came over the speakers. In the car I just can't wait To pick you up on our very first date Is it cool if I hold your hand? Is it wrong if I think its lame to dance? Do you like my stupid hair? Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear? I'm just scared of what you think You make me nervous so I really can't eat The class nodded their heads in time to the music, some getting up andndancing to the sample's pulsating techno beat. Jan and missy hi-fived eachnother as the chorus came on. Lets go Don't wait This night's almost over Honest, lets make this night last forever Forever and ever Lets make this last forever Forever and ever Lets make this last forever As the last 'forever' slowly faded away, Jan and Missy's smilesndissipated, and they stood their, staring into each other's eyes, theirnhands clasped together from the hi-five. Two seconds later they shook outnof their trance and both turned away, embarrassed. The only person who hasnwitnessed this event was Torrance, and she smiled as she stood behindnCliff.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7nThe bell rang suddenly and Cliff stood up to dismiss the class. \"Okay guys,nthere's no time to hear the second mixed sample, so we will hear that nextnweek. Have a good day, and I'll see ya next week!\"nEveryone grabbed their books and ran out, eager to have their mid-morningnbreak. Missy ran up to catch up to Torrance. Turning, Torrance grinned atnher best friend. \"Haha, what was all that about?\" Torrance stopped walkingnand struck a dramatic pose. \"Staring into each other's eyes, the loversnclasped their hands.\" she said dramatically, flourishing her hands. Missynrolled her eyes and grinned. She shrugged, putting her hands on her hips.n\"I really don't know! It was as if the world stopped for a minute-do younthink he likes me? It was a pretty cool feeling, I can tell ya!\"nGrinning mischievously, Torrance rubbed her hands together. \"Only one waynto find out.\" She cupped her hands to her mouth, and yelled out in Jan'sndirection.n\"Hey Jan! Wanna go to the movies with me, Miss and Cliff tomorrow night?\"nJan turned, a thoughtful look on his face. He shrugged. \"Yeah, okay-I'llnsee you guys at about six, your place?\" (He doesn't sound very enthusiasticnabout it, thought Missy disappointedly.)n\"Yeah, it's a date!\" replied Torrance, turning to snigger at Missy, whosenmouth was open from that brash pun. Jan gave them his thumbs up, and thennwalked to his locker. When he was sure the girls were nowhere in sight, henlet out a little whoop of happiness. Finally, I'm going on a date! Is thisnwhat I want for Missy and I? Slamming his locker, he made his way over tonthe college's most popular coffee shop, Cheer. Back at Torrance and Missy's lockers, the two girls discussed the events ofnthe next night. Exhilarated, Missy could not stop smiling. \"Oh my god! Incan't believe I'm going out with Jan!\"nTorrance smiled as she closed her locker. \"Well, technically it isn't andate because Cliff and I are gonna be there, but don't worry, we'll givenyou some private time.\" Poking out her tongue cheekily, she continued.n\"Hey, I gotta tell Cliff about our plans. I'll page you if everything'sncool. Meet me at Cheer, okay?\"n\"Yeah, sure. I was thinking of going there anyway. Later!\" The girls split. Cheer's doors creaked open, and Jan turned to see who it was. It was Missy.nSmiling, he beckoned her over to his spot in the ordering line. \"Hey! So,nyou excited about tomorrow night?\"n\"Yeah, definitely!\" Missy said, reaching for her wallet. \"I really want tonsee Queen of the Damned. Join me, or die,\" she said, mimicking the vampirenqueen's accent. Laughing, Jan ran a hand through his hair. \"Yeah, very coolnlooking movie. Pity Aaliyah died-may she rest in peace. She was a greatnsinger, real hot too!\"nMissy shook her head in amusement. \"You boys, all the same.\"nFinally reaching the counter, the pair ordered. \"One cappuccino, please.\"nJan ordered. \"I'll have a mochacchino, thanks,\" ordered Missy, speaking atnthe same time as Jan. Looking at each other, they grinned. Jan has such ancute smile! Thought Missy. Simultaneously, Jan thought, I can't believe I'mnfalling in love with my best friend-but I just can't help it. She'sngorgeous! After paying and grabbing their Styrofoam cups, they looked around for anvacant table to sit. Seeing as Cheer was the place to go for a quick fix,nit was no surprise that the tables inside were all taken.n\"Well, seeing as there's no space in here, do you wanna sit outside?\" askednJan. \"It's kind of stuffy in here anyway.\"n\"Yeah, I agree!\" laughed Missy, as they exited the coffee shop. They spiednan empty table, and walked over to it. Setting their cups down on thentable, they sat down next to each other. Lifting her cup for a sip,nsomething in Missy's pocket beeped loudly.n\"Oh shit.\" Looking down, Missy pulled out her minute pager from her pocketnto check who had messaged her. It was Torrance.n[Cliff says that's fine. Plans are 6.00 at your house. Be at Cheer soon.nWait for me.] While Missy was checking her pager, Jan bent down to tie his shoelaces.nLooking up at the same time, their eyes locked. Speechless, they staredninto each other, as their heads slowly came closer, and closer, until theirnlips met in a long, lingering kiss. Moving closer, Jan put his arms roundnMissy's waist, her arms round his neck, as the kiss intensified. Theynkissed for what seemed like an eternity, their bodies moulding to eachnother.nOpening one eye, Jan saw all the people in the coffee shop staring out tonthem. He pulled out of the kiss, and both him and Missy looked down,nembarrassed.n\"We'd better stop. People are staring.\"nMissy giggled. \"Guess we should have left this to the movies, hey?\" Jannlaughed, and ran one hand through his hair, looking down. \"Yeah.\" Lookingnup, he grinned wickedly. \"How about you and I, disabled toilets, in fivenminutes?\"nMissy looked shocked. \"Jan!\"n\"Just kidding Miss, just kidding,\" laughed Jan.","LastChapter":"Chapter 7nThe bell rang suddenly and Cliff stood up to dismiss the class. \"Okay guys,nthere's no time to hear the second mixed sample, so we will hear that nextnweek. Have a good day, and I'll see ya next week!\"nEveryone grabbed their books and ran out, eager to have their mid-morningnbreak. Missy ran up to catch up to Torrance. Turning, Torrance grinned atnher best friend. \"Haha, what was all that about?\" Torrance stopped walkingnand struck a dramatic pose. \"Staring into each other's eyes, the loversnclasped their hands.\" she said dramatically, flourishing her hands. Missynrolled her eyes and grinned. She shrugged, putting her hands on her hips.n\"I really don't know! It was as if the world stopped for a minute-do younthink he likes me? It was a pretty cool feeling, I can tell ya!\"nGrinning mischievously, Torrance rubbed her hands together. \"Only one waynto find out.\" She cupped her hands to her mouth, and yelled out in Jan'sndirection.n\"Hey Jan! Wanna go to the movies with me, Miss and Cliff tomorrow night?\"nJan turned, a thoughtful look on his face. He shrugged. \"Yeah, okay-I'llnsee you guys at about six, your place?\" (He doesn't sound very enthusiasticnabout it, thought Missy disappointedly.)n\"Yeah, it's a date!\" replied Torrance, turning to snigger at Missy, whosenmouth was open from that brash pun. Jan gave them his thumbs up, and thennwalked to his locker. When he was sure the girls were nowhere in sight, henlet out a little whoop of happiness. Finally, I'm going on a date! Is thisnwhat I want for Missy and I? Slamming his locker, he made his way over tonthe college's most popular coffee shop, Cheer. Back at Torrance and Missy's lockers, the two girls discussed the events ofnthe next night. Exhilarated, Missy could not stop smiling. \"Oh my god! Incan't believe I'm going out with Jan!\"nTorrance smiled as she closed her locker. \"Well, technically it isn't andate because Cliff and I are gonna be there, but don't worry, we'll givenyou some private time.\" Poking out her tongue cheekily, she continued.n\"Hey, I gotta tell Cliff about our plans. I'll page you if everything'sncool. Meet me at Cheer, okay?\"n\"Yeah, sure. I was thinking of going there anyway. Later!\" The girls split. Cheer's doors creaked open, and Jan turned to see who it was. It was Missy.nSmiling, he beckoned her over to his spot in the ordering line. \"Hey! So,nyou excited about tomorrow night?\"n\"Yeah, definitely!\" Missy said, reaching for her wallet. \"I really want tonsee Queen of the Damned.

He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter One: The Lullaby The kingdom, for the first time in many years slept peacefully, for they once again had their princess back, though one soul could not rest, the princess herself. Little Ofelia, Moanna , she reminded herself, sat in her bedchamber, the fire lit the room faintly and filled it with warmth, but it didn't ease the child's small fears. The little fears that sit with you when you're in a new place, a strange unfamiliar place, where every shadow look like a figure and you can't tell what's what, though her room was beautiful. Her room was filled with warm colors of golds, reds and yellows. The fire place was carved from Marble and Ivory, with marking and statues of strange creatures and familiar ones, such as the Faun and his fairies. There were beautiful carpets that would put Persian's to shame and mahogany chests, dessers and wardrobes that reminded Moanna of warm chocolate. The ceiling was hail and vaulted and while the walls were paneled with the dark chocolate wood from the waist down and covered in a soft pale gold up, the ceiling itself was painted to look like a scene from one of Ofelia's, I mean, Moanna's story books. Moanna had been trying to get to sleep for a few hours now, but she just couldn't sleep. Everything was still so new and Moanna was still had a bit of Ofelia still in her, she still hadn't gotten all of her memories back, though she recognized her true mother and father after a while and could feel that they loved and had missed her dearly, she still couldn't remember any times she might have spent with them. So there she sat in the middle of her bed, her large book in lap that her dear friend the Faun had given her, looking though all the stories and pictures it painted for her. Hoping she could remember something, anything. It wasn't long before a familiar shadow crept into her room. She looked up, a smile alright planted on her pale face. \"Faun!\" she gasped softly and jumped up to hug her dear friend, who accepted it without a second thought. \"Your Highness\" he spoke in his soft, ancient voice that reminded Moanna of the trees. \"You are still up?\" he asked, stroking her soft ebony hair and holding her chin. She smiled sadly and nodded. \"I can't sleep\" she admitted softly, \"everything is so new and . . . I . . . I cannot remember anything Faun!\" Slowly Moanna dark eyes began to mist, she pulled away to wipe her eyes, sniffling a bit. \"I can't remember anything about my life here, all I remember is my life above, what if I can never remember?\" Moanna was becoming Ofelia once again, afraid and crying because she didn't want to leave, she didn't want to be away from her new home and all alone. The Faun only smiled, he moved to hold the child, the faeries buzzing and chittering about as they too tried to coo their little princess. \"Now, now\" said the old faun, \"it has only been one day my princess, and your soul is very weak. Rest, my princess, in time your memories will come back. I promise\" he said, tapping her on the nose. Moanna sniffled a bit and wiped her eyes, but smiled at her dear friend and nodded. She moved to get back in bed and the faun tucked her in. \"D-do you know any lullabies?\" Moanna asked softly. The faun froze; his brow knitting as he thought back, way back to his youth but could not think of one lullaby for his princess. \"I am sorry princess but I know none\" he said as he made his way to the shadows, but seeing the disappointment on Moanna's face, he turned back. \"Actually, you highness, I may know of one\" he said, placing his hand on one of the bed post and holding up one of his wooden fingers. The faun moved to sit at her bed side; he began to hum softly, his old crooked hands brushing away her black hair as he began to sing; his voice deep and warm. \" Sleep, oh babe, for the red bee hums The silent twilight's fall Aoibheall from the gray rock comes To wrap the world in thrall A leanbhín ó, my child, my joy My love and heart's desire The crickets sing you a lullaby Beside the dying fire Dusk is drawn and the green man's thorn Is wreathed in rings of fog Siabhra sails his boat till morn Upon the starry bog A leanbhín ó, the paly moon Hath brimmed her cusp in dew And weeps to hear the sad sleep-tune I sing, my love, to you Sleep, oh babe, for the red bee hums The silent twilight's fall Aoibheall from the gray rock comes To wrap the world in thrall A leanbhín ó, my child, my joy My love and heart's desire The crickets sing you lullaby Beside the dying fire . . . \" The faun hummed softly as he ended the short lullaby, seeing Moanna had fallen asleep. The poor girl was more tired than she realized. The Faun smiled, leaning forward to plant a soft kiss upon the princess's forehead, so glad was he to have her back, to have her home. \"Sweet dreams, my Moanna\" he said softly before fading into the shadow. Hello Everyone! This is my first Pan's Labyrinth fan fiction so any comment is fine. I decided to work on one after reading a beautiful FF called 'To Wed a Faun' very good but rated M so careful kiddies. I'm gonna be pulling different mythologies in this one and will update every now and then. This story takes place after she arrives at the castle and follows up to a bit after she starts ruling, just an FYI, so it's going to be long and have a few drabbles here and there. Hope you all enjoy, will post soon :D[Chapter 2] The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry. He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter 02: The Library In the few weeks that past, Moanna felt herself feeling better in her new home. Yes her father was busy, but after losing his child to the world above, he hardly ever turned her away when Moanna wanted to speak to him, show him something she found, or show a picture she drew with Pan during her lessons. Speaking of which, they seem to be going well. Right away Pan was made to be Moanna's instructor and she took to learning like a duck takes to water. Moanna was fairly content with snuggling up to Pan with a book in her hands as they read together and learned about the world, important people and creatures. Creatures that would help her, creatures to avoid and some creatures that Pan would show her later in life. Some books Pan had to read to her, they were in a language that looked familiar but she couldn't quite read. It was the Fae language which looked like a mixture of Gaelic and Latin. Turning through one of the books, Moanna was showed a beautiful picture of one of the most gorgeous women she had ever seen. She look to be made of light almost and glowed with vibrant beauty. She had white eyes with flowing golden, almost white, hair and was surround by the forest and its creatures. Moanna made Pan pause as she looked over the picture. \"That is Aoibheall, your highness\" \"Ah-Veel?\" Moanna tried to pronounce. \"She is very pretty\". Pan nodded, \"she has great power, little one, and ruler of the northern lands from here\" \"There are other kingdoms?\" Pan nodded once again, his wild mane falling onto her head and shoulders. Moanna was starting to notice that, ever since she had arrived, the kingdom had been getting brighter. It was bright when she arrived but everyone seemed so happy and Pan was changing. Not drastically, little things at first, like she noticed his broken horn was fixed when she came back. His hair was getting more vibrant and body didn't shake as much as they first met. Moanna giggled and playfully tugged at it, making her old goat shake his big horned head and snort. He wasn't mad though, only smiled and tugged at her hair. \"How many Kingdoms?\" she asked curiously. \"There are four, including our own. Aoibheall lives at Carraig Liath\" Pan answered as they continued reading on. \"Moanna!\" It was late and both Pan and Moanna had been reading different books when her mother had walked up, holding her baby brother and a servant trailing behind. \"There you two are, you are both going to be late for dinner\" she smiled. Moanna was the first to get up and rush to her mother. Nuzzling into her robes as Pan placed the books upon a desk. \"Forgive me your Highness\" he bowed. \"We were both so involved in our lesson that we didn't realize it was late\". \"It's quite alright Faun\" she said stroking her daughter's hair with one hand while holding her brother with the other. \"Come we shall all dine together, the librarian can grab those books\" she said. \"Yes, Your Majesty\" The faun said, bowing his head and then following along the Queen, little Moanna holding his hand while they walked. Hello Everyone! Thank you so much from the Reviews! I hope you all enjoyed this one. It was short yes but these are sort of tid-bits of Pan and Ofelia's life from now till fully grown. AriesAriels: I hope this translates correctly, if not, blame google translator! Merci beaucoup! J'espère que vous avez aimé ce chapitre. D'autres viendront, lentement mais sûrement! English : Thank you so much! I hope you liked this chapter. More will come, slowly but surely! Anne Oying: Thank you! I loved this song too, I couldn't believe how luckily it was to find it :3 Black-x-kimono-x-otaku: Thank you so much, I know the summary wasn't all that great but you'll just have to wait and find out what happens with these two. I will say that we go all the way till she is a woman so who know what will happen. I'm half making this up as I go x3 lol.[Chapter 3] The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry. He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter 03: The Memories Of all the memories I could remember . . . why these memories? Moanna had awoken up to hear the screaming from her dream was reality and it was coming from her. The poor princess had been in the Kingdom a month, wondering when she would get her memories back and now wishing she hadn't. She shivered and her skin was drenched in sweat. Moanna felt like she couldn't get any air, sucking at it like a fish. It took a familiar wooden hand on her shoulder to get her to calm down. \"Faun!\" she cried, grabbing him and holding him as she cried and sobbed. Pan's heart broke, he hated seeing his princess like this and knew it would come, knew she had to remember eventually, he just hope the bad ones would come later. Moanna didn't want to remember but she did. She watched though her own point of view as she died . . . She was sitting, in a beautiful garden, watching as the fearies danced and sang in their chittery voices. She sang with them, clapping her hands, she saw golden hair fly about her. That wasn't her hair . . . was it? She could hear the happy chuffing noise of the faun, laughing and clapping his hands as well. It was so strange to see him, he almost shown like Aoibheall, he looked younger, his hair more vibrant and his eyes so bright, Moanna had wondered just how long had she been above. Pan had spoke but she couldn't remember what he said, then he had walked off, to get something . . . perhaps . . .That was when it began to turn into a nightmare. Moanna looked up to the sky, the twilight haze was purple and orange, a moon dancing along. She had sighed sadly, remembering how much she wanted to see the world above. She looked over, the faun was a few yards away, discussing something with her father. Moanna smirked. A peak . . . A peak of the world wouldn't hurt, would it? Moanna started to creep away. She heard Pan cry out to her and began to run. She ran along the towers, pass the mountain ranges. Pan was running after her but had lost sight of her. She remembered finding the stairs that led to the above world. She had paused for a moment, taking a look up to see how far she'd half to climb, before she heard Pan call out again. Quickly Moanna rushed up the stairs, faster and faster, she was giggling, smiling. So happy to finally get a peak of the above world. She came to door that would lead her out and just as she opened it. Bright light blinded her, burned her eyes so badly . . . She could remember pain and cold . . . she couldn't stop coughing . . . it hurt so much and she couldn't call of help. She couldn't call for Pan because she couldn't remember. It was so scary; dying was nothing like Ofelia's death. Dying was cold and dark, there was no light, no hope. . . Moanna shook in Pan's arms, \"It . . . it was so cold Faun\" she whimpered. Pan held her close, his ears falling back. He remembered that horrible day. He had left her only for a moment, only a moment and she had gotten away. He had tried to catch her, tried to save her but couldn't, he wasn't fast enough. Seeing her body . . . cold as ice and so pale. He almost died that day. Wanted to die, but the King, who was wise for such a young king, knew she'd be back. Knew her soul was still trapped there. Pan did nothing but search for her; countless times he had been too late. His Moanna had grown up and had children of her own, or was too old and soon to die once more. She was a flower once, he did his best to keep her safe but winter came early and killed her before he could see if it was truly her. He had failed but he wouldn't this time. \"Shhh . . . it's alright my princess\" he whispered softly, trying to calm her. \"I'm sorry . . . \"He whispered softly as she fell asleep. \"I'm so sorry my Moanna . . .\" Moanna fell asleep in Pan's arms, and he stayed by her side throughout the night. Hey guys thanks so much for the comments and reveiws, they really do help alot! Will write more later, see you all soon X3[Chapter 4] The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry. He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter 04: The Lord of the Wilds It had been a few days since Moanna's nightmare, she was still a little shaken, but Pan was able to get her to come outside. She didn't want to be alone. If she wasn't with Pan she was with her father, if not him then her mother, where she sat currently. Their castle was so large for being underground. It was like a large mound and they were inside it with spirals and towers that shot out from it, as well as bridges, walkways and gardens that lead to the mountains, plains and forest of their world. Moanna admired it all as she stood on the balcony of her mother's room. \"Moanna\" her mother called. She rushed up to her mother, crawling up in the bed with her and her little brother. He was so beautiful, a small, chubby baby with golden hair like her mother and dark eyes like her and her father. She wondered curiously if her hair would turn blonde or if maybe her father's hair was once black when he was younger. Her mother cuddled her closer, glad to finally have her two children back in her arms, she watched as Moanna looked at her brother with curious eyes. \"Was he born of the moon too?\" she asked. Her mother eyes rose up, she didn't expect that. \"No, he was . . . a surprise. Your father and I thought we could not produce another child. I am very barren\" she said sadly. \"I cannot have children easily\" she said when Moanna gave her a confused looked. \"Was that why I was born of the moon?\" Moanna asked. The Queen nodded, \"Your father and I wanted a child so badly. We had so much love to give\" she smiled and stroked her daughter's hair. \"But we could not bare a child. So we went to the Lord of the Wilds. Asked him to help us, but he said he couldn't, but he'd ask the moon to help us. It wasn't long after that, that the Lordo fthe Wilds visited us once again, a child in his arms. He said that the Moon had granted us our request. The mark on your shoulder proves you are of the moon\" she said. \"What's he like?\" she asked. \"Who?\" \"The Lord of the Wilds?\" Moanna asked. \"Well he is very old, and he mostly keeps to himself.\" She said. \"Sounds lonely\" she said, cuddling into her mother's side, closing her eyes. The Queen smiled, \"Perhaps, but he is a strange creature . . .\" \"Perhaps one day I shall go meet him, thank him for helping us and father\" Moanna smiled with a child-like joy. Her mother smiled back. \"Perhaps one day you can, when you're older and can walk in the forest on your own\" she said. Moanna spent the most of the day speaking with her mother and helping her with her baby brother, Cáel. They ate, and then Moanna was getting ready for bed when a familiar green fairy fly by to perch on her shoulder. Nuzzling into her hair, making the princess giggle. \"Ah! Your highness, she has grown fawn of you\" Moanna turned, smiling as Pan came into view from the shadows. \"Hello Faun\" she said watching as the fairy flew to land one of Pan's large curved horns. The old goat bowed gracefully this time, \"Shall I tell another story Your Highness?\" he asked, his old creaking body steeping over to her bed as Moanna got under the covers. \"Perhaps of Great Raja Naja of the dark seas? Or of the White Hart?\" \"No\" \"No?\" Moanna shook her head. \"I want to hear of the Lord of the Wilds\" she said holding the blankets on to her chin. Pan froze. \"The . . . Lord of the Wilds?\" Moanna nodded. \"Mother said he asked the moon to give birth to me, I'd like to meet him, thank him.\" Pan smiled and sat on the side of her bed. \"Ah well, the Lord of the Wilds is very old. Older than the forests! Older even than the mountains they root on!\" He started. \"He is an old creature who protects the forest and guides its creatures, but very secretive, I don't even know him that well\" Moanna was still giving him that look. That disappointed look, thinking she would never meet the 'Lord of the Wilds'. \"Ah, but do not so sad my princess!\" The faun said stroking her cheek. \"I do know that the Lord of the Wilds has always been watching you. I'm sure one day you will meet him. Perhaps even be able to thank him\" he chuckled as a fairy chattered and moved to rest in Moanna's pillows. She began to smile again and Pan was relieved, \"Shall I tell you some more stories? Until you fall asleep, Your highness?\" he asked tucking her in. To his surprise, she shook her head no. \"I think . . . I think I'll be ok\" she smiled snuggling up. \"As you wish . . .\" he said bowing. \"Faun!\" He turned right back around. \"Could . . . could she stay?\" Moanna asked point to the fairy that was snuggled in her pillows still. He nodded and bid her a good night before disappearing back into the shadows. Moanna was still afraid but fell asleep dreaming of what it would be like to meet the 'Lord of the Wilds'. Agh this chapter is kinda crap. But I wanted to get it out there before doing a time shift. Thank you again for all the reviews and favs! They do help![Chapter 5] The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry. He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter 05: The Hiding Spot It had been a few more months and Moanna was finally settling into her life at the palace. She was also getting many lessons from Pan and even began to remember things again. Though, thankfully, none were quite as scary as the first time. She remembered people, names, places, things she and Pan would do like take walks in the gardens, the games they would play, she assumed that the Faun was some sort of care taker for her, as well as a teacher. They were studying right now, the Fea language. Though most Fea could speak most all languages, it was due to knowing Fea, the root language. Moanna was still trying to relearn it, though it was hard with her mind wandering. \"Your Highness?\" She looked up from the window, strange birds, more exotic than any of the world above, were flying by. \"Oh! Sorry faun\" she smiled and turned back to him. Pan smiled, she had such a fresh new look on the world. \"Mmm come on, faun. You've been teaching me all day, let's play a while\" Moanna said with excitement as she stood and tugged on his hand. \"Very well\" Pan said, closing his book and walking with Moanna to the several royal gardens. The gardens were alive with foliage and little creatures. Pan's odd eyes watched the small white hand that clung to his old wood one. He had missed his Princess, his heart ached when he was cruel to her in the world above, it rejoiced when she ran to his arms. \"Faun?\" Moanna's voice shook him from his memories. \"Turn around and close your eyes\" she giggled. Pan became wary instinctively. \"What for your Highness?\" he asked. \"Well we can't play 'hide and seek' if you're watching where I hide, can we?\" she said giggling. \"Now turn and count to ten\" she said, giving his belly a push, making the old goat grunt. Sighing, Pan reluctantly turned around, closing his wide eyes and began to count. His deep, creaky voice listing off the number from ten as Moanna took off to find a suitable hiding spot. She looked and looked, finally, near the edge of this garden there was a waterfall that lead to the next garden. Moanna quickly dashed down the steps that had been carved into the rocks and went to the water fall. It was perfect! The waterfall hid a cove that was huge to fit Moanna, the faun and even her family too. Moanna squealed as her side got misted from sneaking into the cove. About now, Pan had finished counting and began to 'look' for Moanna. He chuckled, well he sort of cheated, he followed his nose and his old, peach fuzzed ears listen for where she could be. Deep down he was worried, surely she wouldn't of headed for the surface again, would she? No, course not! He thoughts to himself. She remembered what happened to her when she did the first time. . . Her . . . her soul can't make a second trip up to the surface again. He thought with dread. When Pan finally reached the waterfall though, he froze, he couldn't smell Moanna anymore. The trail went cold, panic struck him hard. \"Your highness?\" He called out. Moanna heard Pan calling out and began to giggle and laugh, her faun clearly had no clue how to play hid and seek. Her giggles rose to Pan's keen hearing, he looked around, befuddled as to where she was. \"Princess?\" he called again, softer, looking among the rocks and brush. Glancing over the edge of the garden to the other he glanced curiously at the waterfall. His heavy hooves clopped down along the rock carved path, down to the small ledge that lead to Moanna new secret place. \"Your highness?\" he called ducking his huge horned head into the cove. Moanna giggled and popped up from behind a large rock. \"You are horrible at hide and seek\" she grinned, running up to hug Pan's waist, who sighed with relief. \"Then we must play something else\" he chuckled. Stroking his hand through her hair, \"come we will walk and let the sun dry us. I can show some of our worlds plants, what ones can heal and what ones can help you\" he smiled, leading her from the cold cove and shaking his body, much like a dog and making that high pinch noise that always made Moanna giggle. She took his gnarly hand tightly in her small hand, Pan giving it a squeeze as he lead her on to the next garden, pointing out flower that would cure wounds and bark to chew on when sick. He even showed her where the mandrakes grow. The day ending with Pan Sitting, curled around Moanna as she sat, leaning on his hip while weaving the small flowers and grass and making rings to place on Pan's head and horns. As she weaved they spoke, Moanna telling Pan and little bit of her life from the Surface. It wasn't all that bad, at least before her father had died. The children she played with, the kittens she would feed milk too and all the wonderful books she would read. Pan would smile and listen, helping her as she placed her own flowery wreath on her head, it was crocked and Pan adjusted it so, tapping her gently on the nose. They joked, laughed, told stories and finally ending the day with Moanna nestled against Pan's chest as he sang his little lullaby for her. He voice, deep and soothing. It sent her off into another world of dreams and wonders. While Moanna's ever watching guardian cradled her. \"A leanbhín ó, my child, my joy. My love and heart's desire\" He whispered softly as he carried her back to the castle. Thank you for all the reviews! Thank you so much! I'm working on so many things right now that it's gonna be a while till the next update, I'm sorry! But it'll be a sweet one. ~Irish Neko[Chapter 6] Chapter 06 The years past, in the blink of an eye it seemed for the old faun, Pan, watched his young highness grow into a young lady. The child of merely eight years old to a young princess of twelve, it was amazing how she went through the changes, though some traits stayed the same. Her hair stayed the same dark raven wing black, which was odd but no one question it. If anything Pan grew to like this color, her dark hair framed her white porcelain face beautifully as it grew to a long length, reaching all the way to her shoulder blades. Like the full moon on a dark, enchanted night. It was fascinating to watch her blend her dark hair and his golden auburn colored hair when she would braid them together, but slowly Moanna's powers grew. Yes, the young fae princess was slowly gaining the powers that the fae that she had only just started to use when she left to the surface. Moanna's powers was with the plant life. She was still new to it, but with concentration, Moanna could help flowers grow and make dying grass become healthy. Wasn't much, and she could only do so much before becoming tired, but Pan saw that she had a gift for it. Pan emerged from the shadows into the warm room of Moanna's . His body no longer creaked as grew healthier over the years. Though his skin still had the carved tattooed designs along his flesh, the hide itself soften and filled out. With the fae princess safe in their kingdom, he ran around, scouted and took care of the kingdom's land with far more care, as well as being Moanna's forever caregiver. His horns were thick and strong, no cracks, while his mane grew thicker and the golden hue shined. Pan smiled, wandering if Moanna would weave flowers through his mane once more. \"Faun!\" Moanna cried happily, seeing him appear in her mirror. Running and showing her new tiara, it wasn't so much new as it was finally passed to her from her mother. \"I'm so excited, I can't wait to see all the other fae kings and queens\" Moanna smiled. \"So much excitement, you'll start flying if you're not careful, Princess\" Pan chuckled and ears flickered. \"Come, let me comb your hair\" he cooed. Moanna nodded and sat on her little bench and watched as Pan walked up behind her and started to comb her dark locks. \"There will be princes there too\" she giggled. Pan stopped combing, only briefly before starting again, Moanna saw a look of distain on his face but in Pan's mind, the faun grew very protective and dare he say . . . jealous? To think that his Moanna was thinking of princes and not solely on her dear faun, it made the faun sizzle with rage at those princes. He snorted, \"They are frumpy creatures\" he lied, starting to braid her hair, taking the ribbons on her vanity desk and braiding them into it. \"Mother says I should try to play with them, the princess too\" she said looking up at her faun and smiling. \"Don't worry faun\" she cooed, \"You're still my best friend, ever\" she smiled and it made the anger that was in Faun's soul to vanish. He stroked her cheek and smiled back, leaning down to nuzzle her and hug her. \"As are you my dear Moanna\" he cooed. It made his heart ache, to think of the times he missed his sweet Princess. Pan finished up braiding Moanna's hair then led her down to celebration. It was one huge birthday party that was sure. The kings and queens of the East, West and especially the North! Moanna was so very scared when she first set eyes on who must be Aoibheall, the Queen of the Northern Kingdoms, she was white hair, not blonde, white and she practically glowed a soft aura of power. Her Husband was just as handsome and by her side was a boy. He was a bit older than Moanna, maybe fourteen, short white hair with the top pull back into a short ponytail. His eyes were ice blue and he spotted her first of his family and smiled. Moanna smiled back. The party ensued and Moanna met many people that day. Kings, Queens, creatures, Myths and various animals came to greet the youngest princess in the Kingdoms and welcome her to some of the few small steps to the fea realm. At twelve Moanna would start to learn not just how to use fea magic but to start helping her kingdom. Mind you, small things, but helping her people none the less. The children were nice to play with, the two other princesses were from the Western and Eastern Kingdoms. They were nice enough, but their older Brother's like to tease and play, it made Moanna giggle as one made the girl's hair freeze. Moanna had gotten a few gifts as well. A beautiful quill and ink set, scrolls and new books, as well as beautiful dresses and even a quilt. Looking outside Moanna saw that some of Pan's fearies floating about, dancing and motioning her to come with them. She smiled and was able to get away. Out on the porch the fearies floated around a gift for Moanna. It was, well she had never seen it before, it was group of wood pipes, all different sizes. Moanna picked it up and looked at it curiously, It was lovely orange color with lovely carvings in a language that Moanna could not read. Blowing on the pipes, it made noise. \"It's a Pan Flute.\" Moanna gasped and turned around to see the Northern Prince. She stayed silent as he stood there The fearies were hiding behind Moanna, they didn't seem to like the prince but didn't mind him. \"You . . . um . . . you play it\" he said looking at Moanna. The both stood in an awkward silence Moanna large eyes looking at the boy when spoke up. \"I . . . I um . . . I like your hair!\" He said blushing. Moanna blushed as well. \"Thank you . . . do you know how to play?\" she asked showing him the reed. He nodded \"I sort of know\" he said and showed her how to hold it. \"Then you blow in a reed for each note. The smaller ones are high notes I think . . .\" Moanna began to play it, she was terrible and mostly making noise but she smiled at the flute and looked up at the boy. \"Thank you . . . what's your name?\" The boy laughed. \"Cian\". \"You're Highness?\" Spoke the faun as he step into view. Both young royals looked up at him. \"You are both missing the celebration, I think we should head indoors\" she said, stroking Moanna's hair. As he lead them inside. Moanna holding her flute close. It was later on in the night, after the celebration had calmed down and people were getting ready for bed, Moanna sat up in bed, trying to play her flute. Pan sat with her, watching and grimacing with she hit and bad note . . . which was a lot. His ears were ringing after awhile. \"Perhaps you should try practicing tomorrow princess?\" Pan moved to start tucking her into bed, she gave him her flute and he put it away with loving care. \"Thank you for the flute faun, I'm not very good at it though\" the princess spoke sadly but perked up as her faun friend laughed deeply. \"You are learning, I shall get my own come tomorrow and we will learn together\" he smiled. Moanna grinned and cuddled into the blankets. \"Alright, tomorrow, we'll start\".","LastChapter":"Chapter 06 The years past, in the blink of an eye it seemed for the old faun, Pan, watched his young highness grow into a young lady.

I kind of agree, so this is what comes out. It takes place not very long after Rocky IV. Is also inspired by a pretty depressing insight Sylvester Stallone had on the future of Ivan Drago's character; basically becomes a drunk and commits suicide. This will probably have some hints of Drago/Rocky, but in a borderline sense. This is friendship first and foremost, and there will be warnings if it is taken further in any chapter. So if you don't like, maybe don't read! ;) 888 888 888 Lost In Translation 888 888 888 Chapter 1 A Shame Ivan wipes his mouth and looks with disinterest at the red line splitting across his hand. It's not especially painful, and he has been expecting it anyway. \"Want me to add another one to that?\" Balboa asks. He isn't taunting him. Well, so far as Ivan can tell. He isn't very good at reading people. Isn't very good with people anyway. Maybe Balboa is taunting him. Ivan wipes his mouth again. He's been standing in Balboa's doorway for about two minutes, attempting to say something useful. It has been an excruciating effort so far, since he can barely hold Balboa's gaze for more than a few seconds. \"Why're you here?\" Balboa asks the obvious question. Ivan isn't sure. He hasn't thought about that. Well he has, but not why . There's a difference. He wants to say something, but his mouth is too dry and his throat feels like it might be closing in. This always happens. He looks at Balboa's hands. They don't look very extraordinary out of their gloves. Neither does anything else about him. That's what's so amazing though. Sometimes he wonders if it was all a dream. He opens his mouth, and still he's a mute. Balboa makes a snorting sound, and Ivan recognises it easily as derision. The sort which he finds too often these days, but for some reason it's much worse coming from Balboa. \"I guess you forgot to pack your tongue again,\" Balboa says. Ivan tries again; \"I come to see you,\" he begins, and his voice breaks a bit at the end. \"Yeah, I can see that,\" there is mild sarcasm there, but at least Balboa is looking at him now, like he might be kind of interested. \"What is it? Somethin' about the fight? You lookin' for another?\" he looks Ivan up and down. \"I'm done with that. I fought for Apollo. You know that.\" Ivan physically recoils. His stomach tightens with the name, and even though he tries to ignore it, it's actually impossible. It forces the words from his mouth. A soft, cracked sound. He's not even sure if he's spoken them; \"I am sorry,\" there it is. There isn't so much a relief residing over him now, as there is a weight moving past his chest. Not gone, but shifting anyway. Balboa stares at him, like he's looking at him for the first time. Ivan's not sure what it's supposed to mean, but his heart is a hammer, like it's going to burst out of him. Balboa turns away. \"I don't need no apology. It's not gonna change nothin' now, is it?\" Ivan swallows, and looks at the ground. In a way, he's furious Balboa hasn't punched him yet. He's braced for it, he's expecting it, he wants it. It's so disappointing. \"Who did that, anyway?\" Balboa gestures to his lip. \"some crazy drunk?\" Ivan shakes his head. \"Someone. I don't know.\" \"They were probably crazy,\" Balboa's mouth curves something like a vague smile. \"Well. Thanks anyway. For apologisin' and stuff. Guess it's appreciated.\" There is nothing in his eyes. The weight in Ivan's chest settles again, like a stubborn throb. It's not going to leave him, he understands that now. He feels dizzy. Balboa's face draws into something like concern, and then his voice, matching it; \"You okay?...\" He's not. Definitely not. They've told him it's normal. Beads of sweat turning red, ache in the gut, till it comes up again, and then ragged breathing. Cold sweats. It happens sometimes. He's been told not to worry about it, so he tries not to, but it's harder to deal with like this. When he's standing in Rocky Balboa's doorway, and Balboa is watching him like that. \" Hey ,\" Balboa is suddenly much closer. Ivan wonders how that happened, and then wonders how he has found the floor. And his body is shaking, even though he's not cold at all. A hand reaches his own, and then fingers curl together and Ivan does not want to let go. \"Okay, it's okay,\" says Balboa. Ivan blinks up at the other man, and there is a strange moment of clarity. Then nothing else exists in his mind for a little while. 8 When he wakes, Balboa is cradling his head, like he might be something too fragile. It is almost funny. \"Wake up,\" Balboa says, rocking him a bit. It's soothing, Ivan doesn't want it to stop. \"You hear me? Drago?\" It's a chore to keep his eyes open, they feel heavy. But Balboa is very close, and Ivan wants to look at him. \"I called a doctor. They're coming right now.\" Ivan tries to nod, since his mouth isn't working again for some reason. His head aches and there is something warm sliding down his cheek. \"You cut yourself,\" Balboa explains. \"When you fell,\" Ivan rolls his head to the side and closes his eyes. He doesn't even remember falling, but it doesn't matter now. There's a hand sweeping over his face, very carefully. He feels safe. 888 888 ~thanks for reading, more to come.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 888 888 888 Encounters 888 888 Waking up again is not a relief. There are machines making whirring sounds. Ivan is so sick of machines. He pulls a wire from his wrist and sits up. \"They've told you to take it easy,\" Ludmilla places a hand on his arm. He lies back down and stares at the ceiling. He can feel her watching him for a long time, even when he shuts his eyes, and pretends he is not there anymore. \"You can come out in a few days. Nicoli will be there to greet you,\"she tells him, and then stands up. He listens as her footsteps click along the tiled floor and fade away. He doesn't open his eyes again until he hears the door close. 8 Nicoli is waiting for him. There is an unceremonious moment, where a hand grasps his own, and there is a forced smile between them. Maybe Ivan doesn't read people very well, but he knows Nicoli well enough, and he knows when it isn't real. It doesn't matter anyway. All false pretences disappear when they're out of the hospital, in the dark of a foreign street. Ivan had almost forgotten he was there. \"Balboa found you,\" Nicoli states, like he's just swallowed a very hard pill. Ivan's tight smile falls away and he looks at the ground. It's easier that way. \"What sort of game was that?\" Nicoli snaps. \"You wanted to go crawling to that american fool for forgiveness? What has he turned you into?\" The voice echoes all about the street, and the slap of skin on skin is even louder, when Nicoli's hand connects with Ivan's face. It stings like it always does, but Ivan does not react anymore. He doesn't say anything. \"Ridiculous,\" Nicoli snorts, and then walks away. 888 When he returns home he waits a few minutes outside the house. The curtains are drawn in the front bedroom, and he knows what to expect. The front door opens then and a man walks out who Ivan does not recognise. There is a tremor of nerves on the stranger's face, but Ivan just walks past him into the house. He closes the door and looks up the stairs to see his wife in her dressing gown with a cup of coffee. \"Hello, dear,\" she says, with not a trace of regret. \"Good flight?\" Ivan has walked in on his wife fucking before, so it isn't anything new. Before it was Nicoli, but Ivan doesn't particularly care who it happens to be. The only thing is that they thinks he doesn't know, and they exchange smiles that make him feel ill and like he shouldn't be there. They think he's stupid. He's...not exactly okay with it, just resigned. 8 \"I'll be accompanying Nicolai to Rome,\" Ludmilla tells him one early morning, kisses him briefly on the cheek. She doesn't even bother with reasons anymore. Ivan looks at her body, naked in the morning light. They haven't had sex for a long time, and Ivan does not miss it with her. But he does miss it. \"Okay,\" he says, and closes his eyes. Sometimes he wishes he hadn't come home. 888 The phone rings and Ivan hears Balboa's voice on the other end. He holds the handle a bit tighter. \"Hey. Hope you don't mind I got your number,\" Balboa says casually, more like a drawl. There is a tiny silence. \"Just wonderin' if you're...okay...\" Ivan stares out the window. It's drizzling rain and the sky is grey. \"Yes,\" he says. There is another tiny pause, and for a moment Ivan thinks the line is dead. Then; \"I'm here, just checking out the lovely scenery, you know. And I like the snow kinda, you know?\" Ivan feels his mouth turning up a fraction. \"You are here?\" he wonders out loud. Something strange has happened to his stomach; it feels tight, but not in a terrible way. \"Yeah. So. If you're around. Let me know.\" Ivan eventually finds his voice; \"yes,\" and hesitates. \"Thank you,\" 888 There is a knock at the door, and Ivan almost pretends not to hear it. His english is still quite broken, so he worries about talking, even more than usual. Balboa looks friendly though. There is something very disarming about him, out of the ring. Ivan wonders if he looks the same. He doesn't have much of an impression of himself. \"Is your wife around?\" Balboa says, like its obligatory. \"She is away,\" \"Right,\" Balboa nods, and then suggests going for a drink. Ivan doesn't drink too much, which makes Balboa laugh and ask him if he's as Russian as he appears. Balboa drinks for them both, and Ivan mostly just stares at the table, wondering how this strange situation even started. \"You don't talk much, do you,\" Balboa says after a while, and looks thoughtful. \"Is it cos of the language thing?\" He speaks in a gentle voice, like he's trying to coax something from a terrified child. Ivan also notices he has leaned forwards a bit, like he expects Ivan is going to whisper his reply. Ivan shrugs, then clears his throat. \"I'm Russian,\" he says in explanation. He is happy to hear Balboa laugh at that, and he manages to look Balboa in the eye. It's not quite as terrible as he thinks it might be. \"And...I am not...my english is...still not good.\" \"You sound fine to me,\" Balboa tells him, something like a smile on his face. \"Anyway, I'm not exactly Shakespeare here, am I?\" Ivan looks at the table. Doesn't know what he's supposed to say. Balboa sighs. \"Let me buy you a drink. C'mon, just one.\" Ivan lets him. \"Why did you come here?\" he decides to ask after a while. \"Besides all the snow? Same thing as you,\" Ivan is confused. \"To say sorry,\" Balboa elaborates. Ivan is even more confused. \"I do not...understand...\" \"I beat you up pretty good. Don't it deserve an apology?\" Something tugs up at the edges of Ivan's mouth. \"That's the first time I've seen you do that,\" says Balboa, and he is grinning. \"Y'know, it makes a big difference.\" Ivan tips his head, embarrassed, and finds himself smiling a bit more. \"Beautiful,\" Balboa says. 8888[Chapter 3] This fic got homoerotic very quickly. I have no regrets. It's Ivan Drago era Dolph Lundgren. What do you expect. 888 888 Chapter 3 Like A Robot The pulse of anxiety is a constant behind Ivan's exterior. His tomb of strength is always being challenged, chipped away at by outside monsters, but even more his own. He knows that one day he'll crack and there just won't be the strength or even a purpose to fixing it anymore. It is a losing battle, between what comes for him and what fights inside of him, it is useless. For a time, he is happy of Balboa's distraction. The determined sheer force of the other man is already a thing of awe to Ivan, and somehow he finds himself drawn into a want he has never felt before. 8 \"It's because your Russian, isn't it?\" Balboa says, for perhaps the hundredth time. He's used this as an excuse for everything Ivan says (or does not say), and does. Like now, when Ivan can't bring himself to accept Balboa's forgiveness, not without turning away and feeling the familiar twist in his stomach. \"I mean it,\" Balboa says, and repeats; \"I know you're sorry.\" It makes little difference to Ivan. Maybe it is because he's Russian, he doesn't really know anything else. Is he supposed to be okay with killing someone now? It can't be that easy. Balboa places a hand on Ivan's shoulder, and it's the first time he's ever done that. With a fierce instinct, Ivan shoves the contact away. \"Don't,\" \"Why?\" Balboa isn't going to back down. \"You're the one who came to me, remember? Or were you too fucked up on drugs to remember any of that?\" Ivan meets Balboa's gaze, a tide of fear clinging to his torso, the realisation that Balboa probably knows everything. Of course he does. \"Didn't you come to apologise? Or was that all some dream?\" Balboa presses. \"I didn't-\" Ivan doesn't know why he's protesting the fact. \"I am not...\" \"You're not sorry?\" Balboa raises a brow, and although he looks entirely sceptical, there is a trace of worry on his face. Ivan doesn't want him to think anything like that. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"of course I am...\" he tails off and bows his head. There is the hum of voices in the background. He's almost forgotten that they're in a bar, and people occasionally brush by. Sometimes people stare at them; the poisonous amount that like to say words against Ivan, although he doesn't really hear what they say anymore. And anyway Balboa's hand has somehow curved under his chin, tilting his head back up to look at him. That distraction. \"I know you are,\" Balboa says, the assurance deep in his voice. Somebody walks by and says something jeering, pulling Ivan out of the moment. He gestures to the bar exit and they leave at once. 8 Outside, Balboa stares at Ivan in small confusion. \"What did he say?\" Ivan shakes his head. \"Nothing,\" \"C'mon, that's not fair. Tell me.\" Ivan feels his face heating up, and Balboa notices at once. He smiles uncertainly. \"Sorry...if that all looked a bit...over friendly in there?\" Ivan is relieved that Balboa cottons on so quickly, so relieved that he laughs a tiny bit, and feels better for it. Balboa looks at him, happy surprise lighting up his features. \"Maybe I'll have to start doing that more often,\" he considers, and briefly takes Ivan's arm, as they walk away. \"If I can get a laugh from the silent Russian, I must be doing something right, hm?\" 8 Ivan lets Balboa lead them wherever he wants to go, and somehow they wind up outside Ivan's training facility. Balboa stares at it and whistles. \"Can we go in?\" he asks, the eagerness obvious in his voice. Ivan hesitates. Though it's ridiculous to even consider that he shouldn't, it's there anyway. Like an automatic reaction, like a robot. \"C'mon, you can tell me all your superhuman secrets,\" Balboa decides for him, and leads the way. Inside it's dim and empty, not that Ivan had expected anything else. Instinctually he looks to the spectators glass box, where Nicoli is usually watching him. To see it abandoned is strangely liberating, and Ivan does not head straight to the changing room for once. Instead he turns and watches Balboa, who is looking at everything as though it is an amazing dream. \"You got everything here,\" he says, and taps random buttons on random keypad consoles, watching how they light up and coordinate with different machines. \"Holy shit,\" Ivan sits on a bench, smiling a bit at Balboa's awe. \"Look, what the heck is that?\" Balboa says, and ends up tapping a machine to figure it out anyway. \"Oh...for biceps? I get it now...\" he looks at Ivan. \"Do you want to try it?\" \"Sure,\" Balboa nods, and quickly takes a seat. The familiar set of determination crosses Balboa's face, and Ivan watches him as he flexes and lifts the handles. Maybe they're heavier than anticipated, because Balboa grunts, but apart from that makes no sign that he'll stop. Ivan sits back, watching is somehow easy, and he thinks he could do it forever. Eventually Balboa stops and wipes a hand over his brow. He grimaces a bit at Ivan; \"Are these weights set for you?\" Ivan nods. \"That figures. No wonder you're perfect,\" he carries on before Ivan has the chance to deny such a thing; \"so you gonna show me how it's actually done?\" Ivan does a better job of disguising his uncertainty this time. After all, if he's confident of anything, its this sort of thing. He nods and stands up, briefly looking over the machine and then sitting at it. He puts his elbows on the rest in front of him and takes the handles, easily lifting the weights up. A screen flashes up on the machine console, giving out a few numbers. Balboa keeps his eyes on Ivan, and Ivan is very aware of that. He feels another set of weights, press against his shoulders. Balboa is standing behind him, holding the tense mass of muscles there, and Ivan wants to stop flexing but somehow knows he cannot. He focuses ahead, watching the numbers get higher and more nonsensical, because really he can't concentrate on anything else. \"Your muscles are crazy,\" Balboa comments, like there's nothing wrong with it. Maybe there really isn't, and Ivan is just being strange to think otherwise. Strange to feel his heart rattling in his rib cage, the thrum of his pulse getting quick with everything but the weight of the machine. Rocky's hands are the greatest weight he's ever felt, and they're not leaving. They're tight on his shoulders, moving slowly...fingers digging against his skin, smoothly and with a rhythm, loosening the muscle...even if it's a burden on his nervous mind, the touch is gentle, and at the back of his mind, Ivan can feel himself unfolding. He likes this. What is it... The dimness of the gym suddenly lights up, casting them both in a spotlight. Ivan straightens (he'd somehow found himself leaning heavily back) and the weight on his shoulders falls away in an instant. \"I saw a light on,\" Nicoli says. He is standing in the doorway, smiling innocently. Ivan know's better. He blinks at the ground, listening as Nicoli gets closer to them. \"It's always nice to see you training after hours, Drago.\" \"I was-\" Ivan speaks to the floor. \"He was giving me a demonstration, Mr. Koloff,\" Balboa interrupts smoothly. \"Was very impressive,\" Nicoli keeps smiling. \"Was it? But not on par with you I suspect, Mr Balboa?\" there is a biting edge in his tone. \"Though we do our best with Ivan, I'm sure you've come to appreciate that.\" \"Yes,\" Balboa nods, uncertainly. He looks at Ivan, like he expects him to say something. Instead Nicoli walks over to him, puts a hand on Ivan's shoulder, though it is a far different sensation to anything Ivan felt a few moments before. His body freezes and his throat has closed in on itself. \"Drago is impressive, yes, Mr Balboa,\" Nicoli looks Balboa up and down. \"But perhaps that is a greater testament to you, and how easily you claim victory,\" he shakes his head, more to himself, then looks down at Ivan. Ivan blinks ahead, pretending that the hand clamped on his shoulder is not Nicoli's. \"I can assure you it was no easy victory against Drago,\" Balboa says. \"wouldn't it be stupid to think it was? I mean, you thought he was gonna win, didn't you, Mr Koloff?\" Ivan looks up at him, always surprised by Balboa. \"True,\" Nicoli admits. \"so greater the disappointment,\" \"Mr Koloff-\" \"It is a great shame, I cannot deny,\" Nicoli interrupts. \"When you expect a specimen, made to win, turns out a loser,\" his mouth moves a vaguely sarcastic smile. \"But what can we do, Mr Balboa? But live with that?\" Balboa pulls a face, and Ivan notices the fury flashing behind his eyes. He is still surprised with the way Balboa grabs Nicoli's arm, and wrenches it away from his shoulder. \"Funny, how differently people look at things,\" Balboa says. He looks like he wants to punch Nicoli out. Ivan isn't sure he'd try to stop him. Nicoli does not seem upset by it, and he just takes a step back, and smiles sardonically at them. \"It's interesting. To see you both out of the ring together. I can almost see...how you might forgive him, Mr Balboa,\" his gaze holds on Balboa for the longest time, and then he turns and leaves. The lights dim down again in the gym. Unconsciously, Ivan sighs and sinks forward against the bicep machine, letting his head lean heavily in his hands. Balboa's hand hesitates on his shoulder, but this time Ivan wants it there, and all the uncertainty before that has vanished away. \"Man. What an asshole,\" Balboa says. 8888[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 - A Last Drink 888 888 \"How do you stand him?\" Rocky asks. It's been just over a week, and Ivan is so used to Balboa being around that he doesn't like to think about when he isn't. \"I don't know how you do it,\" Balboa says. \"he's a headcase, that's for sure.\" They're walking along a strip of road Ivan isn't familiar with. Balboa has a habit of leading the way, and Ivan has a habit of following without question. Yesterday they ended up in an old mans pub, and one of the old men had stared and asked them if they were lost. Ivan felt his face heat up and wanted to leave, whilst Balboa laughed and got into a strained conversation with them about the differences between Russian and American beer. Now Ivan is getting used to when Balboa does things like that, or at least he's starting to learn what to expect. \"So. Are you ever going to stand up to that guy? Or you gonna just, you know, keep acting like his pet robot, or something?\" Balboa stops at the corner of some street. Ivan turns to face him. \"pet robot?\" he wonders. Balboa snorts. \"yeah. Look, I'm not tryin' to be rude or nothin', but he's playin' you a fool, Drago.\" Ivan considers. Balboa hasn't really stopped ranting about Nicoli since that incident in the gym. He doesn't want to let it go, and Ivan is confused and fascinated by it. He keeps wondering if it's because Balboa actually cares. \"Nicoli is my superior,\" he decides simply. \"I have to take his orders,\" \"you don't have to do anything, you lunatic,\" Balboa starts to say something else, but then seems to think better of it. Instead he just looks Ivan up and down and shakes his head, smiling a bit. \"c'mon. Let's make the last drink a good one,\" Ivan lets Balboa take his elbow, realising that this is his last night in Russia. He didn't imagine he'd be sad about it, but there it is. \"Maybe I'll achieve the impossible, and get you drunk?\" Balboa grins. 8 They go to a bar Ivan has never seen before. All streaking lights and loud disco music. Ivan pushes some money into Balboa's hand. \"For me?\" Balboa puts on a girlish tone and laughs. \"thanks, Drago,\" his tone is sincere though, and Ivan leans on a table, watching Balboa's back as he goes to get the drinks. There's figures dancing all around him, but Ivan isn't keen on anything like this at all. If he could he'd be outside, or maybe even at home. He wonders if he really is a robot sometimes. He blinks up and notices Balboa is talking to a women at the bar. She's curling her hair round her ear and laughing. Ivan looks away. At least he'd be able to talk to Balboa at home. \"Hey,\" Balboa taps his shoulder and puts a drink in his hands. \"Thought maybe I was gonna lose you in all these crazies for a minute,\" Ivan follows Balboa's gaze all around, barely noticing that a group of women have been edging around him, closer and closer. \"D'you want me to save you?\" Balboa smirks around his drink. Ivan swallows, obscenely embarrassed, and nods his head. Balboa grabs his arm and pulls him away. \"sorry, ladies. He's taken.\" Ivan lets Balboa drag him through the crowd, through the blur of lights and dancing bodies, and then to a dark corner of the bar. \"Perfect,\" Balboa says, and takes a seat. \"we'll be safe for...oh, about five minutes, maybe?\" Ivan tips back his drink, wanting to disappear with his embarrassment. \"Does it ever get old?\" Balboa is still smirking at him. \"What?\" \"You know what. You could have your pick of anyone in this room.\" Ivan frowns at the table. \"I don't think so,\" \"Sure you can,\" \"I am married,\" Ivan tells him. It's far harder to say than he'd thought. Balboa leans back in his chair. \"Yeah, but you wouldn't know it,\" Ivan looks at him, feels like he's been hit harder than any punch he ever got in the ring. \"What do you mean?\" he holds his glass a little tighter. \"Just what you think,\" Balboa mutters, stirring his drink with an idle finger. Ivan feels hot and uneasy. For once he's thankful for the blasting music, thumping against his ears, and the distracting shapes of people dancing around them. Anything to save looking at Balboa for another moment. A few people are staring at them like vultures, Ivan stands and goes to the restroom. 8 Inside it's much cooler, and the pounding music is just a dull thump against Ivan's head. He leans against the tiled wall and Balboa's voice echoes about his mind, like he knows everything. \"Are you mad with me?\" Balboa is standing in the doorway. He looks kind of upset. \"think I needed a bit of um...fresh air too,\" he looks at the stained urinal stands and curls his lip. \"those girls love any old american accent, apparently.\" Ivan pushes away from the wall, and shakes his head. \"I'm not mad,\" \"Even if you sometimes act like a robot, you don't lie very well,\" Balboa steps properly into the room, smiles half heartedly. \"Look, I'm sorry I said that about your marriage. It's not my place to say stuff like that. I don't know what goes on with you and your woman. So I'm sorry.\" \"It's okay,\" Ivan says automatically, and feels resigned. \"it is not...much of a marriage.\" \"I'm sure it's not that bad,\" \"It's not bad. Just...disappointing.\" Ivan can't think of any other way to describe it. He has seen the way Balboa looks when he talks about Adrian. It's something Ivan doesn't think he'll ever know. The touch of skin over his hand startles him to his senses. He blinks to find Balboa's hand there, vaguely touching him, but his attention is on the door. \"C'mon. I think the crowds died down a bit. We can survive one last drink, right?\" 888 They leave after a few more than one last drink, and Ivan feels dizzy and wonders if Balboa can tell that he's having trouble walking properly. Balboa's shoulder bumps him, and then Ivan realises he's just as drunk. Balboa hugs himself. \"Man, it's cold.\" Ivan looks sideways at him, thinks about offering his jacket, but hesitates too long. Balboa walks ahead, \"where are we, anyways?\" \"I'm not sure,\" Ivan says, and he still doesn't recognise the street at all. He's not worried, though. For once, he's kind of relaxed. He ambles a little closer to Balboa. \"Are you...are you going back tomorrow, then?\" \"Yeah, around midday. I think the kid's missing me.\" \"Your wife, too?\" \"Oh, she says she don't, but I can tell when she's winding me up, you know?\" Balboa smiles, mostly to himself it seems. Ivan envies that look, how Balboa seems to recall a fond memory with such ease. For a moment Ivan wishes he was a part of whatever it is. \"You gonna miss me?\" Balboa asks. He sounds like he's joking. He probably is, but Ivan answers anyway, not having to think; \"Yes,\" \"Yeah?\" Balboa looks at him, like it's such a shock. Then he laughs and pats Ivan's shoulder. Even though he's drunk, his expression seems to sober when he looks at Ivan properly. \"well, me too. Hey, wait a minute,\" He stops walking and digs around in his pockets. \"It's here somewhere.\" Ivan stands there, swaying in his own vague intoxication. He finds his hand is rested on Balboa's shoulder, and Balboa is holding his arm with his free hand, like he's keeping him upright, and he knows Ivan is such a lightweight. It probably looks really strange. Ivan doesn't really care. \"Damnit,\" Balboa curses. \"I'm sure I brought it with me-\" At the same time a voice yells. It's very close to Ivan's ear, but Ivan reacts too slowly. He hears a cry and then he sees Balboa on the floor, holding a bloody lip. There's a man standing over him, and something metallic is shining in his hand. He swears in Russian, but doesn't get a step closer to Balboa. Ivan cuts in between them and pounds his fist straight into the attacker's gut. The man drops the knife and falls like a dead weight. \"Shit,\" Balboa scrambles to his feet, eyes wide. \"Is he...?\" Ivan doesn't care about that. He holds Balboa's shoulder. \"are you okay?\" he asks. The blood on Balboa's lip looks black in the dark. \"Yeah, man. Don't worry,\" Balboa is still looking at the fallen attacker. \"Shit.\" he says again. Ivan tears his gaze away from Balboa, and then feels sick. His hand is throbbing a bit with that punch, even though it was clumsy. He keeps forgetting he's kind of a good boxer. He doesn't want to have that guilt again. Even if it's just for some stupid tramp on the street. For a moment he is petrified, then he notices the man's chest moving, and a groan escapes his mouth. \"You big dope,\" Balboa laughs unevenly. \"I thought you killed him,\" \"So did I,\" Ivan kneels down. The weight of this relief is sudden and overwhelming. His legs feel unsteady. He rubs a hand roughly over his face. Another shadows falls across him. \"He'll be okay,\" Balboa says gently. \"well, maybe a bit brain damaged...but seems like he probably already was,\" he attempts to joke, and Ivan appreciates it somewhere in his frustration. \"I was stupid,\" he murmurs. \"that was stupid.\" \"Hey, you're my hero,\" Balboa corrects him. \"Could've saved my life.\" Ivan stares at the knife, lying a few feet away. \"Could have killed him,\" Balboa sighs. \"let's just get this bum to a hospital and we can forget about it.\" 8 A hospital turns out to be just down the road, and they leave the tramp in the waiting room, slumped between a Coke machine and a man muttering something about his pregnant sister-in-law. Ivan and Rocky leave when a nurse comes over to see to their crazy tramp. Outside, Ivan calls for a cab and pays for it to take them home. Balboa laughs about his attacker, and wonders if most Russians are out for his blood or if it's just a one off sort of thing. Ivan feels sleepy and kind of sick. He really is a lightweight. Still he enjoys listening to Balboa talk. Outside Ivan's house, they stand for a few minutes, not really awkward, but there's a strange atmosphere. Ivan notices that Balboa's lip is still dark with blood. \"Do you want something...for the cut?\" he asks. Balboa touches his lip. \"Nah. thanks. Ain't nothin' compared to the ring, right?\" he grins, and then grimaces with the way it makes his lip throb. \"Nice right hook, though.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Ivan feels obligated to say. \"Not everyone is...crazy,\" Balboa laughs, in a knowing way. \"Oh, I figured that.\" Ivan can feel Balboa's eyes on him for a few long seconds. Then Balboa seems to have a light bulb moment. He searches in his pockets again. \"ah, I knew it was here somewhere,\" he takes out some little rectanglar tab with a victorious face. \"Here, you keep this,\" he puts it in Ivan's hand. It's a ticket to America. Ivan stares at it blankly, then at Balboa. \"Why?\" Balboa shrugs. \"I dunno. Just in case you ever wanted to drop by again. I can give you a proper tour. I even got a robot butler,\" he pauses, \"Plus, America can be pretty alright, y'know?\" Ivan thinks he understands what Balboa's saying. Somehow his heart beats a little faster, and he can feel himself smiling at the ticket. He puts it in his pocket. He doesn't hesitate or anything, when he takes Balboa's hand and gives it a firm shake. \"Thank you,\" he says. \"It was good to see you again, Balboa,\" he means it. \"Look. Call me Rocky. Everyone who saves me from drunk Russian tramps does,\" Rocky smiles in an earnest way, like he hopes that Ivan will call him that. Ivan looks at the ground, but smiles too. \"okay.\" He can't bring himself to say it yet though. \"Take care, Ivan,\" says Rocky. 8 Later, as he's lying in bed, Ivan stares at the ticket. It's there on the bedside, waiting for him to pick it up and fucking use it. He knows Ludmilla will be angry, but that's the point. Ivan turns over and looks at the empty spot where Ludmilla is supposed to be. He places a palm over the cold sheets. Whether she leaves him or not, It won't make any difference. And this is probably the only chance he'll get, to give her a reason to leave. He tries to wait till morning, but only manages a few minutes. He picks up the phone. Balboa's voice is groggy but amused on the other end; \"Guess I'll pick you up at noon then?\" 888 888","LastChapter":"Chapter 4 - A Last Drink 888 888 \"How do you stand him?\" Rocky asks.

She opens her eyes and instantly sits up in bed. She puts her hearing aids in and grabbed the baby monitor off of the nightstand. She hears Amara making cooing noises and goes to check on her. She opens the slide door and sees Adonis holding their baby girl in his strong built arms. He turns around and smiles when he sees her. Two months apart has the both of them looking far different from who they were before. \"Hey.\" \"Hi. When did you get here?\" She says walking towards him. \"A couple of minutes ago. She's gotten so big.\" He looks down at his daughter and he let's her hold his pinky finger. \"Yeah, so have you.\" She points out his biceps and triceps growth. \"You kind of look like a hulked out teddy bear holding her.\" \"Well she likes it so I'll take it.\" He say, making her laugh. \"I wanted to see my girls before I leave and talk with you.\" He puts Amara back in her crib and he takes Bianca's hand as they sneak out of the room. They walk over to their bedroom and he sits her down in front of him. \"So what did you want to talk about?\" He gets on one knee and takes her hands in his. \"I know that I've asked so much of you and made so many promises that I've been trying to keep. We've been a team for so long and I've been acting like I'm running solo and for that I'm sorry.\" \"D, we talked about this. I've had your back and I still got your back.\" \"Yeah but I haven't had yours. You've been taking care of Amara and I've been closed off through this whole thing when we should be getting through this together. I'm not going to leave you hanging. I don't want to be that husband that just goes on the road and never be there for his wife or his kid. I will always be in your corner like you're always in mine. And that's why I want to give you this.\" He hands her folded pieces of paper. She opens it and sees that it's the lyrics to the song she wrote in the studio before he left. \"Where did you find this?\" \"When I was packing. I read it and it was dope. I instantly thought about people hearing your voice and figured why not give you that moment in Moscow.\" \"You want me to sing at the match? In a whole stadium of people?\" \"As my walk in song. I know you only have a couple more years left and I know you want to be independent-\" He's cut off by her kissing him. \"This is the most amazing thing you've ever done for me other than get me pregnant.\" She says in excitement as she kissed his face. \"So I'm guessing that's a yes?\" \"Yes. I was gonna go and surprise you there but this beats that.\" She kisses him deeply and he held her in his arms. \"There's just one thing you gotta do before we go.\" \"Anything.\" \"Marry me.\" \"Uhhh, we're kind of already doing that.\" He holds her left hand where her engagement ring was on her finger. \"I mean let's get married right now.\" \"Like today now?\" \"Today, tomorrow at the court house or Vegas. I don't want a big wedding, I just want to be your wife.\" \"Is that what you want?\" \"You're all I want.\" She says and he smiles. He kisses her and they fall back on the bed together. \"Babe, what about your legs?\" \"We have two weeks, we're good for one night.\" He takes off his whitebeater shirt and starts kissing her neck. They haven't been intimate in three months so the sexual tension was present between them. \"Okay.\" She wraps her arms around his shoulders and her legs around his waist. \"I missed you so much.\" \"I missed you too.\" He pulls her shirt off and kisses down her stomach. He's about to unbutton her jeans when they hear a cry from the baby monitor. They pause and sigh at the sudden interuption. \"Looks like your other girl calling you.\" She laughs rubbing his head. \"To be continued.\" He says and kisses her lips before sitting back up. He walks to the door and Bianca sits up on her elbows. \"I love you dork.\" \"Love you too.\"[Chapter 2] Adonis and Bianca sat in the ENT's office while Amara was asleep in a stroller in between them. They listen to the doctor talk to them about Amara's treatment and they were lost in all the medical terms and visuals they were given. \"Can you explain it one more time for us?\" He asks the doctor. \"Amara hearing loss is sensorineural, meaning she can only hear small sounds audiotory noise. What we're going to put these little hearing aids around her ears so she can be able to hear.\" \"And this will help her hear? \"Yes. She'll be able to hear small and loud sounds and react to them the same way as any other baby would.\" \"What about her development?\" Bianaca asks her. \"Right now, she's on track with at this stage of developing. The hearing aids will keep her track on track and with some therapy, she'll be fine. I'll give you two a minute while I get the nurse to bring her in.\" She steps out of the room and closes the door to give them some privacy. Donnie lets out a sigh of relief and sits back in his seat. He turns to his right and sees Bianca crying. He gets out of his chair and goes onto his knees in front of her. \"Baby, please don't cry. She's gonna be fine.\" He wipes her tears away from her eyes. \"I'm sorry.\" She sniffles her noise. \"What are you sorry for?\" \"I did this to her. I gave you a disabled baby and she is going to have it so hard.\" She looks over at her baby and puts her hand on top of her head. Donnie puts is hands on the sides of her face and turns it to look at his. \"Listen to me, you did not burden our daughter. She is going to live a happy and amazing life. She's gonna have that because her mother is the most selfless, brave, and strongest woman I've met in my life. And she's got a dad who will kick any guys ass who breaks her heart or try to mess with her.\" She laughs at his words. She smiles and kisses him, resting her forehead and breathes slowly. \"You're really good at this husband thing.\" \"I'm trying. We're gonna be alright.\" He holds her hands and kisses them. \"We got this.\" \"Okay.\" She hugs him and rests her head on his shoulder. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\"He kisses her shoulder and turns his head to see Amara opening her eyes. \"Looks whose up?\" \"Hey mama. How you doin?\" She unlatches her seat belt and takes her out of the stroller and onto her lap. \"Look at her, has no idea what's going on.\" \"She's gonna make it with a mom like you.\" \"You are such a sap you know that.\" \"You think it's cute.\" \"Yeah I do.\" She goes in to kiss him when Amara move her hand in between them. \"I can't kiss your mama Rara?\" \"You are such a daddy's girl huh?\" She kisses her chubby cheeks and hugs her tight.[Chapter 3] Bianca is in the bathroom undoing her braids and putting her hair in a bun with the sides of her hair on her face. She just got Amara to sleep and helped Donnie into bed and treated his broken rib. She finally got to take a shower and get herself ready for bed. She takes one of her birth control pills and drinks some water when she notices her husband behind her with his shirt off, only wearing his grey sweatpants and bandages wrapped around his waist. \"What are you doing out of bed?\" She says as she turns around and putts her hearing aid. Before she could get another word, he kisses her fiercely. \"What was that?\" She says catching her breathe. \"Catching up on lost time.\" He goes in to kiss her again but she pushes him back. \"Nah nah nah, you are not moving anything tonight. \"I can lay down.\" He wraps his arms around her and starts kissing her neck. \"The baby's asleep.\" She chuckles. \"She's in the other room. I got the monitor on in there.\" \"Baby\" She moves her neck and away and looks up at him. \"You almost died tonight. Almost didn't come back and got hit harder this time. You need to take it easy please.\" \"B, I thought I was never going to make it out of there. The only thing that kept me going was you. You keep me breathing and I never want to take that for granted ever again. We only so many moments left and I don't want to waste them. I love you so much and I want to show you how much I do. Whether it be just kissing you, or touching you, or making love to you.\" He presses his forehead against her kisses her forehead. She feels so much emotion just standing in front of each other. What he says relates to her as well, she can't breathe without him and she didn't want to miss any moments together. She moves her head up and kisses him deeply. She moves his hands to her sides and wrapped her arms around his neck. Donnie puts his hands under her thighs and lifts her up in the air. She wraps her legs around him and moans as he moved his hand toward her lower back. He walks out of the bathroom and into the bedroom, sitting on the side of the bed and laying down on his back and her on top of him. She straddles his lap and starts to undo the tie on her black robe. \"Tell me if you want me to stop okay.\" \"I promise. Just be careful.\" \"Okay. Shit, hang on.\" She reaches over to the night stand and grabs a condom in the drawer. \"Not taking any chances this time.\" She says making Donnie chuckle and he pulls her down and kisses her. Two Hours Later \"Hi.\" He looks at her as they lay on their sides after making love. \"Hi.\" She smiles at him back. He bites his lip a little, making her smirk. \"What?\" She laughs as she pushes her nose against his. \"You really know how to work a man.\" \"Fourteen weeks without you is too much for me to hold in.\" She says as she raises her leg over his side.\" You were putting in the work too.\" \"Like I said, I wanted to show you how much I love.\" He kisses her again. \"I missed you.\" \"I missed you too.\" She moves in closer into his arms and rests her head against his. \"You're so beautiful.\" He runs his hand through her hair and moves it down her leg. \"Easier tiger, we just beat our record. Let me get my oxygen back first.\" \"Alright.\" He held her close to him and they keep kissing until something pops into Donnie's head. \"B\" \"Yeah.\" She says as she kisses his neck. \"We haven't talked about if we wanted to have more kids.\" She stops and looks at him. \"This is not the kind of talking I saw having after what what we just did.\" \"I'm not asking to get pregnant again. We just need to have this talk and we can't keep avoiding it.\" \"I'm just scared. I don't know if I could go through it all again. Amara is best part of my life next to you but I going through all of that again. I just-\" \"No, I get it. I feel the same way. We don't have another one so soon. We can wait or adopt, I don't care how we get them. As long as we're their parents, that's all that matters.\" \"Thank you.\" She kisses and she moves over to get on top of him. \"Again?\" \"I told you, fourteen weeks is a lot of missed time.\" She kisses him again and is about to go lower when the monitor goes off. \"I got her.\" He says rubbing her shoulders. \"You sure?\" \"Yeah, I got. I'll bring her in here and she can sleep with us.\" He kisses her as she moves off his lap. He gets out of the bed and grabs his boxer briefs to put on. He pulls his sweatpants on when he catches Bianca looking at him. \"What you looking at nosey?\" \"Nothin, just admiring.\" She says as she lays on her stomach. \"I'm not a piece of meat.\" He jokes around. \"You sure about that?\" She chuckles as he kisses her. He walks out of the room and closes the door behind him. He walks into the next room and opens the door to find Amara crying in her bassinet. \"Hey Rara, it's okay baby daddy's here.\" He pick her up and rests her on his shoulder while holding her back with one hand, while grabbing her traveling bassinet with the other. She starts to fuss again and Adonis starts singing to her as they walk back to the main room. \" We're just ordinary people, maybe we should take it slow. Take it slow ow ow, maybe we should take it slow.\" She settles back down and he smiles at calming her down. He pushes the door open and sees Bianca sitting up in bed in a tank top, smiling from ear to ear. \"She has you wrapped around her finger.\" \"She really does.\" \"How is it that she loves you singing more than me?\" \"She's a daddy's girl.\" \"Well I call dibs on the next kid.\" \"You remember when I sang that song?\" He says as he puts her travel bassinet in the middle of the bed. \"I do. You tried to sing to me in hospital and I almost slapped you to shut you up.\" She laughs. \"At least somebody likes my singing.\" He says putting Amara in the bed. \"Baby I do. I just wished she liked my singing.\" She says laying on her side and rubbing her little belly. \"She'll ease into it.\" He gets into bed and lies down on his back with his head turned to look at his wife and daughter. \"She loves you just as much as I do.\" He holds her hand across the bed and kisses it. They smile at each other and look at Amara sleeping until they fall asleep.[Chapter 4] \"Don, where the heck are we going?\" Bianca asks as they drive through Los Angelas. \"I told you it's a surprise when we get there.\" He says to her as he's at the wheel. \"I know this is your city but I kinda wanna know what I'm in for.\" She says as she checks on Amara in the back as she plays with her mobile attached to her car seat. \"I promise you'll love it.\" \"Okay Indiana Jones. Lead the way then.\" She sits back and looks out the window as he kept driving.\"D, I need to talk to you about something.\" \"Yeah?\" \"It's about the label. They gave me a release date for my album and they want me to go on tour with one of their new artists for promo.\" \"That's great. Who'd they want you working with?\" \"You heard of 6LACK?\" \"Yeah, he's dope. The both of you would sound great together.\" \"Yeah, he's gonna be a feature on the album too. The thing is it's gonna be a two month tour. Twenty four cities and I'll be working with some producers in Atlanta.\" \"Okay.\" \"I'm gonna have to take Amara with me since she's so little or she can stay with you. It's all still fresh on the table and a lot of stuff to work out.\" He pulls over on the side of a random street in a neighbourhood. \"B, you know that I'll ride with you on anything.\" \"But..\" She was ready for him to turn down the idea. \"I don't want you sacrificing your dream for me. This is your time now and I wanna be by your side through all of it.\" \"So your okay with the tour?\" \"I'm all for the tour with only one thing. We go as a family.\" \"What about boxing?\" \"It'll still be there. This is your turn now. This isn't me being jealous or paranoid. I want to be by your side.\" He holds her hand and she smiles at him. \"And you call me sappy.\" She laughs and leans over to kiss him.\"Thank you.\" She looks out the window at where they are. They're parked outside a well put two story house. \"Where are we?\" \"Our new house.\" \"Stop playin D. Why are we-\" He pulls out a pair of keys and holds them in front of her. \"You said we were gonna need space so I looked all over town until I found your dream house.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Merry Christmas.\" She jumps out her seat and reaches over to hug him. She kisses him and and he laughs. \"Easy there's a baby in the back.\" She still kisses him. \"Thank you. I love you.\" \"I love you too. You wanna take a look inside?\" \"Hell yeah I do.\" They get out of the car and she takes the baby out of her car seat. They walk up the driveway and Donnie opens the door to the house. They look around the house with the hardwood flooring and fresh painted walls. \"This is huge.\" \"Do you like it so far?\" \"It's great. The kitchen is beautiful, the carpets, and the-\" She pauses when she looks out the window.\"Is that a pool outside?\" \"With a grill and a basketball net. Five bedrooms, four bathrooms, home office.\" He says as he wraps his arm around her shoulder. \"This is amazing.\" \"Go look around the corner for the best part.\" She walks through the living room into the den area. \"We can make this a little studio. What you think Rara?\" She says to her daughter and she raises her little hand up in the air. \"I think she likes the house.\" \"Home Sweet Home\" He wraps his arms around the two them. \"Things are gonna be different now. You and Amara are my number one.\" \"Good cause we missed you.\" \"Da-\" Amara spits out. \"Did she just say dada?\" \"Baby, she's four months old. She just talk in babbles right now.\" \"I'm counting it as a word.\" He kisses her cheeks, making her and the baby laugh.","LastChapter":"\"Don, where the heck are we going?\" Bianca asks as they drive through Los Angelas. \"I told you it's a surprise when we get there.\" He says to her as he's at the wheel. \"I know this is your city but I kinda wanna know what I'm in for.\" She says as she checks on Amara in the back as she plays with her mobile attached to her car seat. \"I promise you'll love it.\" \"Okay Indiana Jones.

Now that things had started to settle down, it was time for them to enjoy each other by spending some intimate time together on their overdue honeymoon trip. Rocky had brought up the wonderful suggestion of going to the Bahamas and Adrian was more than happy with that destination because all that really mattered to her was that she would be spending time with him. Monday finally arrived and after kissing Rocky Jr. goodbye and making sure the nanny was all set with arrangements, they headed off to the airport to catch their mid afternoon flight. On the drive to the airport, Rocky couldn't stop talking about all the things he had planned and how excited he was to share this with her. Adrian couldn't stop smiling at the thought of how much time and effort he put into this and how happy she was that he would be all hers. They boarded the flight and took their seats in first class, an extra luxury Rocky decided would be nice to take advantage of since it would be a long flight. Once the flight took off, they shared a glass of champagne and a quick but deep kiss that showed just how much they loved each other. Adrian nestled in Rocky's arms, and put her head on his chest; it never ceased to amaze her how safe, warm, and loved she felt when he was holding her. Rocky put his head close to hers so he could smell the delicious aroma of her hair and feel her soft skin as he held her arms. They closed their eyes to take a nap, completely content being so close to one another. Once arriving in the Bahamas they headed over to the hotel to check in. Rocky had reserved the suite, a room that was right on the ocean with large glass windows and the best amenities. The view was breath taking and the evening sky made the atmosphere even more romantic. After putting down their bags, Adrian hurried to the window to take in the beautiful scene and Rocky quickly joined her. As they embraced, Rocky seized the moment to express his love for this amazing woman by telling her how beautiful and precious she was and how lucky he was that she chose him forever. As Adrian looked in Rocky's eyes, she remembered why she had fallen for him so quickly…he was sincere, compassionate, thoughtful, and gentle not to mention unbelievably sensual and physically strong . She had a flashback to their first kiss and how he saw her for who she really was and made sure to let her know how he truly felt about her…that first kiss! It took her breath away, made her hunger for that deeper intimate connection, gave her hope for love. Now here they were overlooking this amazing place and were all alone. Rocky turned toward her and softly picked up her face and leaned in to kiss her. When his lips touched hers, Adrian felt that instant connection that told her he was the love of her life. Rocky began to deepen the kiss by angling his head and supporting Adrian's neck and shoulders. Rocky started exploring her mouth with his tongue and Adrian was quick to follow…Rocky never ceased to be amazed at how passionate and receptive she was. He began nibbling on her ear and slowly he moved to kissing and sucking the sensitive part of her neck. Adrian was in heaven…every time his lips dragged across her skin she felt this fire building lower in her belly. She started whimpering softly as the pleasure got too intense for her to hold in. Rocky responded by pulling her close against him so that she could feel how much he wanted her. Rocky moved back to kissing her on the lips, deeply and passionately, and slowly moved his hands from the arch of her back to the zipper on her blouse. Adrian was only partly aware that he had began unzipping her blouse because she was so intoxicated from his kisses that her hands had been rubbing against his shirt to find the muscles she knew were beneath it. Once her blouse was undone, he made a fluid movement where he untucked her shirt from her pants and slowly moved his hands inside her shirt and around to her front. Adrian needed more as her passion was starting to build quicker and quicker and she wanted to knead her hands in his back and feel his bulging muscles of his upper torso. Rocky sensed the urgency and quickly unbuttoned and dropped his shirt and Adrian let her blouse fall to the floor as well. Adrian knew where this was headed…that intimate place where he would whisper in her ears how beautiful she was and take her flying in his arms on a straight path to heaven. Rocky quickly scooped her up and kissed her right away as he walked toward their bed. He carefully put her down and gave her several quick kisses on her lips to fuel deeper desires. He climbed over her and made a bridge so that he could see and have access to every inch of her. Rocky began whisper how much he loved her as he trailed more kisses down her neck until he got to the top part of her chest. He immediately started sucking and dragging his lips against the area as he got closer to her breasts. She whispered \"Rocky, I love you so much.\" Rocky knew what she wanted to say but had trouble saying because she was so reserved…\"I love you too. Does this feel nice?\" Adrian managed to formulate the words from the recesses of her brain \"It feels uhh so good.\" Rocky loved hearing her respond with pleasure…he knew how perfect they were for each other and sexually was no different. It was amazing how lovemaking felt with her...he was a whole person when they were that close and intimate. Adrian had that way about her that made him ache for her so deeply it hurt. He wanted to go further down her front but her bra and skirt were in the way. Before he would take those pieces off, he wanted to continue exploring her body. He moved his lips down to the part on her stomach below her bra and above her hips and gave her repeated soft, light kisses all over her stomach. Adrian couldn't take it because now he was moving lower…she knew what he was trying to do all too well and she wanted that bra off so he could take care of her breasts. She wanted that attention and whispered \"Rocky, I…\" Rocky knew she need him there so he quickly moved back up to her lips to kiss her while he tilted her a little so he could undo her bra clasp. She felt her bra melt away as he threw it to the side and he covered her by positioning himself above her and cradling her head as he continued kissing her. He went back to trailing kisses down her neck but this time, he moved his hands to her breasts and cupped them as he rolled her nipples in the palms of his hands. Adrian loved his hands on her breasts…that had ALWAYS been one of her favorite spots to have him focus on. She had wrapped her hands around his back and pushed her fingers deeper into his back as a signal to push his head down to where his hands were. Rocky knew exactly want she wanted. Her skin tasted like peaches and he wanted to suckle her breasts and their little pink tip. He surprised her by immediately putting one of her breasts in his mouth and sucking hard! Adrian couldn't help it but that feeling ripped through her so quick that her hips rose off the bed, her hands went right into his hair, and she let out a moan, \"Ohhhhh…Oh my god!\". He didn't stop for a second…he repeatedly kissed and sucked her breast hard and dragged his tongue all along the circular tip of her breast. She moaned louder and wrapped her legs around his lower legs. Rocky lightly took her nipple in between his teeth and gave it a very light tug. With the other nipple, he tweaked it between two fingers and Adrian nearly died…she needed Rocky completely inside of her because her fire was burning out of control. Rocky saw her hips rotate, almost begging for him and he was turned on from watching her react to his every manipulation. He went back to kissing Adrian's lips deeply and immediately took the opportunity to undo the buttons on his pants and pull down the zipper. Rocky followed by quickly undoing her clasp of her skirt and pulled it down in one fluid movement. Adrian had been letting out whimpers of pleasure which told Rocky she was ready. Rocky continued sucking her breasts as her lifted her lower torso to remove her panties. He slowly brought his hand down to her thighs and rubbed his finger tips over her mound to check that she was ready for him. Adrian's throat caught a bit when she realized what he was touching and how sensitive she was. All she could think about was how AMAZING he made her feel. Rocky massaged her outer opening and paid attention to the soft flesh of her clitoral hood. Adrian cried out with sounds of pleasure in Rocky's ear and Rocky whispered in her ear that he loved her and that he was going to take her flying now. She closed her eyes and felt him position himself over her as her started to slowly push into her. He filled her up so deeply and she felt her insides immediately tighten up around him. Rocky couldn't believe how quickly she accommodated him and he felt warmth and tightness that made it difficult for him to hold back and control himself. He kissed her lips repeatedly as he began a rhythmic routine of going deep and then leaning back. He knew exactly what to do to bring them close to the brink…in and out he moved as he picked up the pace and thrusted deeper with each move. He buried his head in her neck and she moaned louder as Rocky's body tightened and he released deep within her. Adrian felt this warm feeling and on his last thrust, they climaxed and expelled a sigh of pleasure together. Even after, he kept kissing her and telling her how wonderful she felt in his arms and she kept whispering how much she loved him. They laid together content and fulfilled from being one. Rocky smiled as he recalled how he had been able to please her and bring her to that powerful climax. He began to drift asleep as the aroma of her hair wafted to his head and Adrian closed her eyes, smiling and feeling protected and engulfed in his muscular arms. Two lovers perfect for each other in every way![Chapter 2] Later, they returned to the room to clean up and go to dinner at a fancy restaurant. When Adrian stepped out of the bathroom, she was wearing a dark blue dress that showed off every curve. She had gone dress shopping a few weeks ago in hopes of finding something elegant and classy but stylish and curvy…the saleswoman had spent so much time with her finding the perfect dress. It had a neckline that was low but not revealing; it was straight in the front, it accented all of her curves, and flared out at the bottom. Rocky was always doing little things to please her and she thought this may be something she could purchase that would catch his eye. The moment Rocky laid eyes on her, he was stunned…he couldn't take his eyes off her even for a second! He could see all the beautiful accents of her body and her slender waist and hips drew his eyes immediately. He was speechless over her utter beauty…he realized he was starring too long when Adrian started to stutter when she asked \"Um…I don't know if this was the best choice, I wasn't sure what to choose.\" Adrian had been so nervous to see Rocky's reaction, plus this was only the beginning and she was worried about starting off some of her surprises right. Rocky immediately walked over to her and took her hands, and it was clear to him that she was a little nervous by her trembling hands and racing pulse. He pulled her so close that he could feel every inch of her body and whispered, \"Yo Adrian, I don't have words 'cause you took my breath away. Relax 'cause I love you and well, you look like a dream. A princess…so beautiful !\" He took her chin in his hand and lifted it so that her lips gently met his. It was a light, but lengthy kiss and Adrian felt it! The electricity ran through her body instantly, and she felt the love he shared for her. After a little bit, he broke off the kiss and kissed her two more times, once on each side of her upper neck…as he did that Adrian couldn't stop thinking about how much she loved that motion. It was one of the sensual acts Rocky did that drove her crazy! Rocky looked back into her eyes and slowly took her by the waist and escorted her to dinner. In the hall, at the table, Rocky kept telling Adrian how beautiful she looked in that dress. She never needed makeup to be beautiful but Rocky could see that she had spent a lot of time fixing her hair and applying her makeup and all he could think was how gorgeous she looked and how lucky he was. Over dinner they talked and laughed about trivial stuff and Rocky told Adrian corny jokes just so he could see her smile and laugh. That melted his heart and made him love this woman so much more…he could be himself and she embraced and accepted him fully. It was so hard to believe that he had married her only 4 years ago…where had the time gone. They were both different people…they were no longer lost souls and discarded members of society; instead they were one as a couple and had a wonderful son that they both cherished. Something about the moment triggered Rocky to have a quick flashback to their wedding day; Adrian walking down the aisle in a gorgeous white dress, their ceremony in church with all their close friends and family, and the romantic wedding night. He loved her so much that he knew when they made love for the first time that night, she was his angel and soul mate. He had gone so slowly and savored every inch of Adrian so she knew how special she was to him. He never wanted to hurt her, the thought made him physically sick, and he remembered how the only thing she asked was that he keep kissing her. He had kept that promise and afterwards he had made any pain she felt initially worth it because he took her soaring and showed her how amazing love making truly is. He jumped back to reality when he heard the waitress thank them as she brought over the bill. As Rocky paid the check and they continued laughing, Adrian noticed the glimmer in his eyes…she knew what he was thinking about deep down and how much they both wanted some private time together. As they walked out of the hall and back to the room, Rocky told her what a great time he had while holding her hand tight and putting his other hand around her slender waist. When they got inside the room, Adrian sat down to take her pumps off, as that had always been her least favorite part of dressing up. She heard Rocky quickly lock the door and she chuckled…he was always so gentlemen like but there were definitely times when she also appreciated his fast thinking and aggressive moves. It took Rocky no time to be kneeling at her feet on the edge of the bed. She giggled; \"Rocky, what are you doing?\" \"I wanna help you with this.\" She shot him a quick smirk and he gave her that sly grin. Rocky slowly rubbed his hands over the sides and heels of her feet and applied a little pressure to massage away any cramps from her shoes. He leaned forward and softly asked her to stand up…he needed to take her beauty in again wearing this breath taking dress and this time he yearned to touch her in every single place underneath. Adrian slowly stood up as Rocky held her arms and turned her around in a quick circle and she giggled as their eyes met. It didn't take long for him to pull her close and passionately put his full lips over her mouth while angling her head so that he could control the kiss. His hands started on her back and hips as he explored every inch of her mouth with his tongue and they began to flick tongues in passionate heat. He quickly moved his hands lower and lower till he rested his hands on her bottom…she knew the dress had been fitted nicely, paying special attention to capture that part of her and she secretly knew that was one area he had been looking at all night. Rocky felt his hands burn…he had been aching to touch and feel her roundness there and now only a few pieces of clothes stood in his way from holding her the way her wanted. Adrian was softly moaning as Rocky continued his flurry of kisses and even went lower to the tender part of her chest that the dress exposed. It already felt so good for her and they were just getting started. As much as Rocky loved the dress, he knew it needed to come off once they got to the bed. Rocky reached around the back of her dress and slowly undid the clasp at the top and brought down the zipper. Rocky was surprised when Adrian broke off the kiss and told him she needed to go to the bathroom. When she came out, she was in a white robe and Rocky wondered what was going on. She approached him and shly took off the robe, revealing a lacey see threw nightie that was incredibly sexy. Rocky was stunned…he got an amazing look at all her figure and spots that he loved. He picked her up and put her on the bed. He stretched out her legs and starting at the toes massaged her legs all the way up to her knees. When Rocky got to her knees, he asked her to lay back a little bit…he ran both hands higher up the inside of her legs and immediately he felt her legs shudder from anticipation and that gave him confidence to continue. Once he reached her upper thighs, he felt the band of the lacey panties and gently tugged them down to her ankles while pushing her further onto the bed. But she was shocked when he quickly ran his hands right back up her legs to the apex of her thighs. Her breathing caught as he curled fingers around her secret place. While he continued his work below, he resumed his deep kisses and started sucking the upper part of her neck which made her arch her back and breathe quickly. Rocky was amazed at how ready she was…her womanhood was slick and Rocky wanted to push her a bit. He slowly slid one finger inside and when Adrian let out a gasp in his ear, he knew she was surprised. He began to gently move it in and out as she quietly moaned his name. He wanted to try one more thing…as they passionately kissed, he slid a second finger into her and began to make circular motions with his fingers. Adrian was shocked…the sensations felt amazing and she knew she was getting close to that feeling inside her that told her she would go over the edge. He increased his tempo and she began whimpering to him and he urged her to let go for him. When she did, Rocky felt her inside clench and let out a small gush on his hand. Rocky wasn't going to give her much time to breathe…he began kissing her belly all the way up to her lips and suckled her neck. Adrian felt like she was melted butter and was paralyzed to the sensations. Rocky positioned himself over Adrian and put a pillow underneath her to elevate her hips a bit. He whispered to her to wrap her legs around his waist. As she did, he slowly pushed himself into her and then pulled out. The next time he pushed in a little deeper and pulled out even slower. Rocky knew this was killing Adrian so he was not surprised when she shoved her hips forward burying himself deep within her. Adrian and Rocky both let out a soft grown and Adrian moaned as Rocky moved around a bit. Rocky whispered in her ear how beautiful she was and Adrian repeatedly told him how much she loved him. Rocky quickened the pace and every time he was thrusting, it was going deeper and hitting a more sensitive spot since Adrian was positioned upward. Before Rocky knew, they were approaching that climax and before he was ready to release he reached down and massaged her nipples. Instantly, he felt he tighten and he pushed forward one more time as they both climaxed together. They laid in each others arms and just lightly kissed and Adrian rubbed his back as Rocky nuzzled his face in her hair. Their love was amazing and rejuvenating.[Chapter 3] Later the next day, Rocky surprised Adrian by telling her that for today's adventure they would be going out on a Yacht he had rented and exploring the island. She thought that was so romantic and hurried to get ready to leave as Rocky packed a picnic lunch and a duffle bag. As Adrian got ready, she remembered how she had really been set on the idea of just bringing one piece bathing suits. She had never been a fan of showing so much skin and it had always made her feel self conscious. Rocky always disagreed when it came to her body image and went out of his way to tell and show her how beautiful he thought her body was. Before this trip, she had discretely gone bathing suit shopping and looked at the options. She really wanted to make Rocky surprised and move out of her comfort zone a little, which was so difficult. Thus, she had struggled with the idea of just wearing a simple one piece as oppose to a two piece bathing suit. What she was unable to see was that at 32 years old and even after becoming a mother, she looked beautiful and her body seemed to have become more developed. She didn't need to \"workout\" which was definitely the way Rocky was able to keep his impeccable physique. Perhaps it was from insisting that she help with house work, chasing after a young son, and eating nutritionally. As she looked in the mirror, she wanted to make that jump and choose the two piece. She had never done this before and she also knew that it would catch Rocky's attention and definitely elicit the response she was hoping for- she was well aware of what made his pulse quicken and sometimes it was just nice to see his reaction when it happened. Beside it would only be the two of them and she would not remove her t-shirt and shorts until they were completely alone. Just then she heard Rocky call out to tell her he was going to load up their stuff and he would meet her outside. Adrian quickly put on the blue two piece bathing suit along with her cover clothes, and tied her hair back in a ponytail. She went and met Rocky out front and they walked down to where the yacht was docked and climbed aboard. The weather was gorgeous- the sun was out, it was warm, and the ocean was so clear and blue. As the yacht pulled away, they stood at the side and held hands and giggled about random things. What was fantastic about their relationship was that they loved each other beyond words but they also really LIKED each other- they were best friends and they were just comfortable being together. As they sailed toward their first stop, Rocky was lighthearted and cracking jokes. \"Hey Adrian, have you heard the one about the fish?\" Adrian was amused and when she replied no she snorted in amusement a little. Rocky chuckled and said \"Why are fish so smart?\" Adrian smiled and shook her head…\"Because they live in schools.\" She couldn't help throwing her head back in laughter…yes it was corny but that's what made it so funny. Rocky laughed and came a little closer and kissed her cheek. He couldn't resist…he got his face close to her ear and whispered, \"Ya know, there's a ton of fish in the sea but you're the one that caught my eye.\" Adrian's heart melted- this is why she knew he was the one so quickly. He had always said little romantic things to her just because and looked at her like she was some precious metal. She turned her head toward him and instantly when their lips met there were fireworks. This kiss was deep and he had completely taken over. He was sucking on her top lip and started moving his tongue in and out. Meanwhile, to deepen the kiss he had tilted her back, leaning against the side for stability but grasping her head and shoulders as he constantly changed the angle. Their tongues were rhythmically dancing and Adrian was only subtly aware that her hands were in his hair and on his back. Neither wanted to break it off but Adrian needed a breath- he was paralyzing her, he made her forget everything. Sensing that, Rocky straightened her back up and pulled away just enough but their noses where still touching. They didn't need to say anything because it was all in their eyes- passion, love, romance, friendship. Rocky knew it was hot out and after that kiss he was sure a drink was needed so he suggested that they grab a drink before the yacht stopped. They got some water and gazed ahead as they approached their little private island. Rocky told her they would have the island all to their selves for the day, grabbed their stuff, and told the captain they would meet the boat back here later. As they got off, Adrian was amazed- all this to explore. Once off, they walked up the beach quite a bit further, laid out their blanket, and left their stuff under a shady palm tree. It was very hot out so Rocky suggested they go for a swim and didn't miss when Adrian's face changed just slightly for a second- he immediately knew something was going on. He smirked, and asked her what the look was for. Adrian couldn't believe he caught that- damn! He was so perceptive. She tried to brush it off and encourage him to come dip his feet first. But she was in for it when he reminded her that they needed sunscreen before they got burned. He was so quick to take off his t-shirt because that was something he was use to- he never wore a shirt at night, near the pool, or after a serious workout. She of course couldn't pull her eyes away for what seemed like forever- he was by far the most handsome man ever and she also could tell he had been working out quite a bit. You could see his toned muscles and he was so well built that it was hard not to stare because his body was so perfect. He wasn't going to say anything but he knew she was looking at him and that always made him smile to himself every time it happened- he knew that was always something that made her pulse quicken. Adrian blushed and quickly snapped out of it and went to help him with the sunscreen on his back and face. She gently rubbed it into his features and then did his back- for some reason this always made her hands tingle as she rubbed it on from his neck to his lower back. \"Thanks,\" he murmured, \"Now your turn.\" Adrian was shaking inside because she still was nervous about this bathing suit issue. Even though she had done the nightie the night before and he had seen her in a lot less clothes when they made love, this was just different for her. The face was first and he was so gentle that it felt good. Rocky knew something was going on because he could see her shifting a little, which she did when she was nervous. \"Alrighty, let's get the back and shoulders,\" he said. Immediately her insecurities kicked in and she dropped her head. He got closer and asked her if everything was ok and if she was feeling alright. Adrian couldn't help but think this was crazy but she was going through with it now. \"Oh yes, I am fine, no problems,\" she said. He quickly shot back at her, \"Somethin' is bothering you cause you won't look at me.\" Let's just do this and get it over with she thought, \"Well I sort of decided to come to the beach with a different style today.\" She could tell he was a little confused, but like you do when you take off a Band-Aid, she closed her eyes, took off her t-shirt, and quickly dropped her bottoms. And immediately Rocky got it and could NOT believe this! She opened her eyes and was so glad she did- she was right about the look he would have on his face. Rocky was stunned- sure he had seen her in undergarments and one piece bathing suits but NONE looked as good as this. She had a blue and white top on that tied around her neck and you got an amazing look at her chest. He knew she had beautiful breasts from experience but this made it explicitly clear. And wow as soon as his eyes dropped just a little lower he saw her unbelievable waste line and stomach. She had always been smaller but she had these curvy hips and a waist that most women would die for. And her legs and thighs were fantastic- slender yet full and strong. Her bottoms fit very well and he hadn't even seen her from the back yet. Adrian couldn't help it- she had to break that awkward silence and chuckled a bit, especially since roles were reversed now. That got his attention and he immediately smiled and stumbled a bit when he knew she was waiting for him to say something. \"Wow, you look fantastic! Where'd you get this?\" Adrian laughed and breathed a sigh of relief and thought whew he reacted how I thought he would. \"The store,\" she replied. He laughed and said \"Yeah but what store? You should go shoppin' there more often.\" She smiled and replied \"glad you like it.\" He was quick on this one \"Uh, like it? Love it is better.\" Adrian handed him the bottle so he could do the sunscreen. He did her shoulders, arms, and back gently and thoroughly- the back was his favorite part because it was like giving her a massage. He immediately held her and gave her a very light kiss as he pulled her toward the water. He admired that she had taken a chance with the bathing suit and done something different- she had really blossomed from when he first met her and clearly her confidence was getting better. Once they were at the water's edge, they dipped their feet and splashed as the waves came in. Rocky wanted to enjoy this time, have some fun, and maybe take advantage of the bathing suit. He ran into the water quickly, came out soaking wet, and then ran out and hugged Adrian who was still trying to get use to the water. He could hear her yelp and laugh as the water touched her bare skin. She was going to get back at him now- she ran into the water and started urgently splashing Rocky as if she was going to scare him away. Yeah right Rocky thought, I am going to win this one! He ran right over to her, picked her up and ran into the water with her in his arms. She was jokingly protesting the whole time but once they were in the water thigh deep, he let her down and held her hand. Adrian swam well but she was more comfortable holding Rocky as the water got deeper and he planned on using that fact. Rocky continued to walk deeper until the water was at about his mid section and Adrian started getting nervous now that the water was above her stomach. He brought her in close to his body so that she was comfortable and able to stay warm. He slowly moved to kiss her and this kiss was like the one on the boat. Adrian immediately grabbed his arms because she knew she was going to lose her balance. Rocky was aggressive- his arms were around her backside, in her hair, and stroking her face. His tongue was in her mouth, his lips were pressed fiercely against hers, and he was changing the angle of his head to keep the kissing urgent. Adrian was in heaven and was following his lead- his kisses were intoxicating and his hands felt like fire against her skin. Rocky wanted to go further but he wanted to change things up a little. He whispered to Adrian to pick her legs up and wrap them around his waist. As Adrian started to pick up her legs, Rocky put his hands on her bottom to support her until she got her balance. Adrian wasn't expecting that and looked at Rocky who had a sparkle in his eyes. She wrapped her legs around his waist tightly and her arms were around his neck- she felt so safe especially considering how strong he was. She leaned her head back and Rocky immediately moved his lips to her neck and sucked hard on the side of her neck. By now, Adrian was moaning from the kisses and now the neck attention- the sucking and nibbling drove her crazy! Rocky knew he was doing well when she pressed her fingers into his back. He did the same thing to the other side of neck and moved his hands to her chest. Just like on the boat, Adrian was unable to put two thoughts together. She loved this man- they were fantastic together because they were lovers and friends and they could tell each other anything. Rocky kept kissing her passionately and he squeezed her breasts through her top. He moved her a little bit higher up, started licking and sucking her chest, and massaged her bottom. Adrian let out a little scream which surprised Rocky a little. He whispered to make sure she was ok and then continued to make her want deep inside. Suddenly, Rocky bent his knees and slid her down so that her lower pelvis could feel his groin. It was pure torture since she could feel his whole shaft right below her. He stood back up, picked her up high, nibbled her neck and ear, and continued his assault on her chest but this time his hands went inside the cups and pushed her breasts up while moving them around. But like before he dropped her and this time started grinding their pelvises hard. Adrian let out a moan and whispered something about needing more but it was hard to tell what she was asking for. Rocky smirked but wanted Adrian to ask for what she needed and all she could respond with was that she needed him inside her. That is exactly what he wanted to hear! He kissed her deeply and quickly picked her up in his arms and started walking out of the water back to the blanket. When they got back to the blanket, Rocky put Adrian down and they continued kissing. Rocky was on top and grinding his pelvis into hers so she could feel his deep need for her. Rocky loved this woman- she was his equal, his partner, his lover. No one made him ever feel like she did- it was pure magic every time they made love and he adored her not only as his wife and an amazing person but as a wonderful mother. Rocky whispered how much he loved her and sucked and licked her ear and neck. Adrian's body felt like a plucked string and her body was humming from his touch- it was no surprise that she only was semi-aware that he was untying her top. She couldn't help call his name and he responded by kissing her deeper and putting his face in her hair. She had never done this on a beach before so there was something that was holding her back from being completely comfortable. He sensed that and whispered to her \"Relax, I promise it will be worth it\" and she remembered that it was just them and she knew that he would keep his promise. Once her top was off, he was immediately at her chest using his hands and tongue. The taste of her was amazing- she always smelled of peaches and sucking her nipples always got him just as turned on as it did her. Adrian knew she couldn't control her body too much longer and she rotated her hips and dug her fingers in his back as a sign to him. Rocky knew he was teasing her but yet he kept kissing her navel and rubbing against her just to push her to the edge. She had enough- she reached down for the string and elastic of his bathing suit which surprised him a little. He chuckled and reminded her to be careful what she asked for because things should be equal. He kissed her and she smiled and moaned in acceptance. Rocky quickly ran his hands down her body, rubbing her legs, as he took off his shorts. When he came back up, he moved his hands to undo her lower tie as he kissed her and told her how pretty she was. She really loved this man- he always made the act special by telling her how beautiful she was to remind her how he truly felt. He pushed her bottoms away and grazed her opening with his fingers to see her quick facial expression. Neither of them could wait too much longer as Rocky moved over her and gently pushed in. Once he was all the way in, they both moaned in pure pleasure as Rocky filled her up completely. Rocky shifted their bodies slightly so that they were more on their sides. He wrapped her legs around his lower back and moved forward a few times so she could feel him much deeper. Adrian was in heaven all right- he was deep but he was also able to hit all the right spots this way. The whole time Rocky was moving forward and changing tempo he was kissing her and whispering how good she felt. He picked up his thrusts and went harder and faster and he knew they were both so close. Adrian threw her head back and called his name as her insides clenched around him and she felt the sensations rock her body. Rocky held her and felt her warmth and tightness, and couldn't hold back and as soon as she let go, he thrust once more and went over into heaven with her as he released inside her. One of the best parts was afterwards because he always held her and kissed her slowly as they recovered in each other's arms. Adrian told him how much she loved him and he put her hand on his chest so she could feel his heart. Rocky told her how special she was and that he loved her as they closed their eyes and relaxed for awhile in the warm heat. As they snuggled, this moment was perfect in every way![Chapter 4] Rocky and Adrian enjoyed a romantic picnic lunch and walked along the beach laughing, holding hands and stealing quick kisses. They made their way back to the yacht so that they could get back to the main island. When they landed, they walked over to a cabana where Rocky had rented a motorcycle so that they could explore more of the island. Surprisingly, Adrian really enjoyed motorcycle riding with Rocky- the wind in your hair, the beautiful scenery, and it helped that she got to wrap her arms around her husband so they were pressed against each other. This was by far one of their favorite activities to do together, especially back home when he would take her out of the city and into beautiful country land. Once Rocky was ready, Adrian climbed on and hugged his waist as a sign she was ready- he chuckled to himself because she always held on so tight which he loved because it told him she felt safe. As they rode along, they pointed out beautiful scenery and took in the fresh air of the ocean. After they had been riding for awhile, Rocky stopped along part of the private section of the beach and they sat on the big rocks and looked out on the ocean. Adrian sat in front of Rocky and leaned back against him while he wrapped his arms around hers. It was relaxing just to listen to the ocean and the sounds of their breathing. As they stared out into the ocean, it was amazing to be in each other's arms in such a nice place. Rocky soothingly rubbed her arms and shoulders which felt amazing- she made a mental note to do the same for him later. Rocky moved his head to inside her neck and began nipping on her, but for some reason it tickled in that spot which immediately made her break out in laughter. He loved to hear her laugh- it was so cute that it always made him laugh. \"You're tickling me,\" she chuckled. \"Maybe,\" he laughed. They decided to stretch their legs and walk further down along the water. As they held hands, Adrian wanted to make sure Rocky knew how much she appreciated him planning this trip and thank him for it. \"Thank you for planning this trip and taking the time to organize all these activities- it was very sweet of you.\" \"You deserve it – you do a lot for me, the kid, and everyone and well we never got a trip after I married you.\" Rocky always wanted her to have the best and it meant a lot- all she cared about was spending time together but it was touching how much effort he put into their couple's activities. His birthday was coming in a few weeks and she was working on putting the finishing touches on his surprise birthday weekend back in Philly. Apollo and Tony were coming from LA and Paulie would be there too. They rode back to the main island and did some shopping- they got something for Rocky Jr. and Paulie and a bunch of trinkets. As they were getting ready to leave, Adrian stopped at a store to pick up a bag and Rocky snuck away to the last store on the street- the high end jewelry store. The first day they arrived, he had preordered a beautiful handmade heart shaped necklace and needed to pick it up. He would surprise her by giving the gift to her at dinner- it had diamonds around the shape and two diamond letters, an R and an A on each side. Rocky told her they had dinner reservations at 7:30 at a fabulous restaurant on the main island so they went and cleaned up at the hotel. Adrian came out dressed in a stunning pink dress and Rocky was wearing a black suit with a thin tie. Anyone could tell they were a fantastic couple- there was something about the way he held her arm and looked in her eyes. It was as if he viewed her as his other half. Their relationship had not always been easy- they had arguments and been through tough times, but ultimately they made it through with an even stronger relationship. Adrian and Rocky had both grown as people but they grew together in a way that made them inseparable. Rocky refused to imagine how different his life would have been if they hadn't gone out together that fateful Thanksgiving night. Over dinner they talked about planning a family vacation and doing some renovations to the backyard once they were back home. Then, Rocky told Adrian he had a surprise for her that he had been dying to give her all night. When she opened the box, her eyes lit up. As she took out the beautiful necklace, she was speechless- it was gorgeous and symbolic of their love with both letters R for Rocky and A for Adrian joining together to make an unbreakable heart. All she could manage to thank him and say was how beautiful it was and how touched she was that he went and personalized it. She had learned a long time ago that now that Rocky could afford nice things, he would spend money on whatever caught his eye that he wanted and honestly she was grateful and touched whenever he chose to shower her. Rocky put it around her neck and they lightly kissed. It was time to head back to the hotel room and settle in. Once they got in, they did their usually nightly ritual of changing their clothes and calling their son to tell him they missed and loved him and check on things at home. It was a perfect ending to the day when they got to hear their son's voice. As they were climbing in bed, there was something Adrian needed to talk to Rocky about. A few weeks, ago she had been to the doctors for her yearly female appointment and because she was now 34, she had brought up the question about having more children. She needed her doctor's opinion since she had those complications with Rocky Jr. and she was getting older. She had always wanted one more child and knew this was a serious adult conversation so she had been waiting till the right time to discuss it. This conversation had casually been brought up in passing before- they both wanted more children for sure but the health concerns were what made them careful. Rocky knew she had something important to say because she turned to face him and got quieter. She sort of tapped on Rocky's leg with her fingers hoping that would get his attention. Rocky quickly put his arm on her shoulder and she moved her legs toward him so that she could be close and face him. Adrian explained that she had been to the doctors recently and after discussing their concerns, the doctor was confident that provided she was monitored regularly and followed pregnancy directives explicitly, there would be less chance of having complications. Rocky was happy at the idea of them having another child but he was still worried about his wife's health- he almost lost her the first time and he couldn't even imagine his life without her. When he told her this, Adrian understood his concern but ultimately the love associated with motherhood was worth the risks. She told Rocky that she would set up another appointment and they could talk to the doctor together but that this idea of adding to their family was important to her. Rocky was very apprehensive but knew she was right- just like he asked her to not stop him from being a man, he couldn't ask her to stop being a woman. Even though there had been health risks with him fighting Apollo the second time, he still did it because he had something to prove and he needed to support his family. He knew ultimately he would have to put his fears aside for the good of their family. Adrian could read the worry on his face and immediately wanted to put him at ease. She got closer and whispered to him \"Let's give it a try. Everything will be ok, I promise.\" He trusted her and believed that - he looked in her eyes and something drew him to her lips. He slowly kissed her, lightly feeling the amazing softness of her lips. She gently pushed on Rocky's shoulders to get him to lean back. Once his back was against the head board, she straddled his legs and continued kissing him changing the tempo and pressure of each kiss, feeling a burning desire to be close to him. Rocky couldn't control his hands- he had to move them from her back to her shoulders to her hips. There was something electric about their kisses- it started sweet and turned intimate. She had made it so her hands and arms were pushing on his shoulders as if to keep water from breaking through a barrier. Adrian was clearly in control which was rare, especially considering how Adrian's normal reserve but her confidence had clearly gone up since they had first gotten together. After awhile she pulled away a bit so Rocky could see that her face was red and her lips were swollen from their passionate make out session. She ran her arms under his shirt, feeling and massaging his bulging muscles, then pulling the shirt up and over his head so she could get a good look at him. Even though she was teasing him, he wanted to let her have some fun taking a more forward role- he would make sure to keep it equal and turn the tables later on. She went to the front of her blouse and slowly started undoing the first two buttons- when she got to the third she decided to start fumbling with them a little to quicken his pulse. When she had undone all the buttons she put it to the side. She realized there was no going back now- it felt different but powerful being the one to steer their intimacy. She knew Rocky would have trouble controlling his hands from here on out so she took his hands and slid them under her thighs so that they were trapped. She started kissing him passionately again, moving her hips over his pelvis, while adding to the torture by gently rubbing her bra against his chest. She could feel he wanted to move his hands to her chest and that he was turned on under his pants but quickly moved her arms to his hands and forced them down, whispering that he needed to be patient. Since her head was already close to his, he decided to tease her in another way- he began sucking and nipping her neck and throat hard, which he knew drove her wild, especially when she whimpered his name several times aloud. She pulled her head away and started to undo her bra clasps. Once the straps fell to her shoulders, she moved her breasts out of the lacy cups and threw her bra aside. She started to touch her breasts and thumb her nipples, knowing and FEELING he was dying watching this- and he was! Usually, he was the aggressor but clearly, there was something very sexually appealing about watching his wife lead. Rocky loved her for so many reasons- his once shy wife had become more confident and aggressive in many ways which he had to admit was very attractive, especially when she occasionally showed that in the bedroom. Adrian was moaning as she touched her breasts and dragged her hips across his pants. All Rocky could do was intently watch as her nipples hardened. She stood halfway up using his shoulders to brace herself and unbuttoned and dropped her jeans, leaving her only wearing panties. As she slowly lowered herself back down, she looked him in the eyes seductively. She kissed his mouth then his chest as she unbuckled his pants. She kissed him and told him how lucky she was and suddenly he felt her hand circle his manhood. Adrian wanted to do something unexpected and please her husband- she loved him more than anything and loved surprising him in the bedroom. She slowly rubbed him up and down several times- he was in heaven, he loved her because she meant the world to him and she had him in the most vulnerable way a woman could. She stroked him, feeling his shaft swell as she massaged the base and tip. He freed his hands and had his lips on hers and his hands in her hair. She knew it wouldn't be long before he insisted on taking over so in the meantime she took his hands and put them on her breasts and then continued touching him with her hand as she picked up speed. Rocky knew he was close to plunging over the edge but he wanted them to come together. Even though he was in the throes of passion, he was incredibly selfless and aware of her needs. All of a suddenly, he fluidly flipped them over and Adrian saw pure primal desire in his eyes. He immediately took her hands and pinned them above her head. Rocky told her he loved her and that it was his turn to please her. Then he took his hand and teased her breasts- pinching her nipple, squeezing the base, breathing and licking the areole. Her mind was black, she barely even realized she was saying his name repeatedly and quite loudly, which Rocky loved to hear. Rocky was still holding her hands as he hooked his fingers under her panties and lowered them down. He started kissing her ribs and stomach and moved further down to her thighs, teasing and tantalizing the inside of her legs before his mouth closed in around her most sacred place. All Rocky could think about was how much he loved her, how ready she was and how wonderful she felt. He felt the tuft of feminine flesh swell as her teased her with his tongue and made circles with his hand. As she was crying out and getting close to climax, he quickly rose over her and slowly pushed himself into her. She was shocked by that feeling of fullness and threw her head back calling his name and grabbing his arms. He moved forward slowly and then picked up the tempo, thrusting quickly and going deeper every time. With each deep thrust, Adrian could feel her walls aching and closing in around his manhood and that's all Rocky needed to push a little harder. As Adrian cried out, her walls convulsed around him, and with that Rocky made one more thrust and then went over the edge deep within her. He rolled them onto their sides so that they were literally pressed together as their hearts slowed down and he kissed her deeply, wrapping his arms around her back. They were each other's world, they were one.","LastChapter":"Rocky and Adrian enjoyed a romantic picnic lunch and walked along the beach laughing, holding hands and stealing quick kisses.

Once Rocky was ready, Adrian climbed on and hugged his waist as a sign she was ready- he chuckled to himself because she always held on so tight which he loved because it told him she felt safe. As they rode along, they pointed out beautiful scenery and took in the fresh air of the ocean. After they had been riding for awhile, Rocky stopped along part of the private section of the beach and they sat on the big rocks and looked out on the ocean. Adrian sat in front of Rocky and leaned back against him while he wrapped his arms around hers. It was relaxing just to listen to the ocean and the sounds of their breathing. As they stared out into the ocean, it was amazing to be in each other's arms in such a nice place. Rocky soothingly rubbed her arms and shoulders which felt amazing- she made a mental note to do the same for him later. Rocky moved his head to inside her neck and began nipping on her, but for some reason it tickled in that spot which immediately made her break out in laughter. He loved to hear her laugh- it was so cute that it always made him laugh. \"You're tickling me,\" she chuckled. \"Maybe,\" he laughed. They decided to stretch their legs and walk further down along the water. As they held hands, Adrian wanted to make sure Rocky knew how much she appreciated him planning this trip and thank him for it. \"Thank you for planning this trip and taking the time to organize all these activities- it was very sweet of you.\" \"You deserve it – you do a lot for me, the kid, and everyone and well we never got a trip after I married you.\" Rocky always wanted her to have the best and it meant a lot- all she cared about was spending time together but it was touching how much effort he put into their couple's activities. His birthday was coming in a few weeks and she was working on putting the finishing touches on his surprise birthday weekend back in Philly. Apollo and Tony were coming from LA and Paulie would be there too. They rode back to the main island and did some shopping- they got something for Rocky Jr. and Paulie and a bunch of trinkets. As they were getting ready to leave, Adrian stopped at a store to pick up a bag and Rocky snuck away to the last store on the street- the high end jewelry store. The first day they arrived, he had preordered a beautiful handmade heart shaped necklace and needed to pick it up. He would surprise her by giving the gift to her at dinner- it had diamonds around the shape and two diamond letters, an R and an A on each side. Rocky told her they had dinner reservations at 7:30 at a fabulous restaurant on the main island so they went and cleaned up at the hotel. Adrian came out dressed in a stunning pink dress and Rocky was wearing a black suit with a thin tie. Anyone could tell they were a fantastic couple- there was something about the way he held her arm and looked in her eyes. It was as if he viewed her as his other half. Their relationship had not always been easy- they had arguments and been through tough times, but ultimately they made it through with an even stronger relationship. Adrian and Rocky had both grown as people but they grew together in a way that made them inseparable. Rocky refused to imagine how different his life would have been if they hadn't gone out together that fateful Thanksgiving night. Over dinner they talked about planning a family vacation and doing some renovations to the backyard once they were back home. Then, Rocky told Adrian he had a surprise for her that he had been dying to give her all night. When she opened the box, her eyes lit up. As she took out the beautiful necklace, she was speechless- it was gorgeous and symbolic of their love with both letters R for Rocky and A for Adrian joining together to make an unbreakable heart. All she could manage to thank him and say was how beautiful it was and how touched she was that he went and personalized it. She had learned a long time ago that now that Rocky could afford nice things, he would spend money on whatever caught his eye that he wanted and honestly she was grateful and touched whenever he chose to shower her. Rocky put it around her neck and they lightly kissed. It was time to head back to the hotel room and settle in. Once they got in, they did their usually nightly ritual of changing their clothes and calling their son to tell him they missed and loved him and check on things at home. It was a perfect ending to the day when they got to hear their son's voice. As they were climbing in bed, there was something Adrian needed to talk to Rocky about. A few weeks, ago she had been to the doctors for her yearly female appointment and because she was now 34, she had brought up the question about having more children. She needed her doctor's opinion since she had those complications with Rocky Jr. and she was getting older. She had always wanted one more child and knew this was a serious adult conversation so she had been waiting till the right time to discuss it. This conversation had casually been brought up in passing before- they both wanted more children for sure but the health concerns were what made them careful. Rocky knew she had something important to say because she turned to face him and got quieter. She sort of tapped on Rocky's leg with her fingers hoping that would get his attention. Rocky quickly put his arm on her shoulder and she moved her legs toward him so that she could be close and face him. Adrian explained that she had been to the doctors recently and after discussing their concerns, the doctor was confident that provided she was monitored regularly and followed pregnancy directives explicitly, there would be less chance of having complications. Rocky was happy at the idea of them having another child but he was still worried about his wife's health- he almost lost her the first time and he couldn't even imagine his life without her. When he told her this, Adrian understood his concern but ultimately the love associated with motherhood was worth the risks. She told Rocky that she would set up another appointment and they could talk to the doctor together but that this idea of adding to their family was important to her. Rocky was very apprehensive but knew she was right- just like he asked her to not stop him from being a man, he couldn't ask her to stop being a woman. Even though there had been health risks with him fighting Apollo the second time, he still did it because he had something to prove and he needed to support his family. He knew ultimately he would have to put his fears aside for the good of their family. Adrian could read the worry on his face and immediately wanted to put him at ease. She got closer and whispered to him \"Let's give it a try. Everything will be ok, I promise.\" He trusted her and believed that - he looked in her eyes and something drew him to her lips. He slowly kissed her, lightly feeling the amazing softness of her lips. She gently pushed on Rocky's shoulders to get him to lean back. Once his back was against the head board, she straddled his legs and continued kissing him changing the tempo and pressure of each kiss, feeling a burning desire to be close to him. Rocky couldn't control his hands- he had to move them from her back to her shoulders to her hips. There was something electric about their kisses- it started sweet and turned intimate. She had made it so her hands and arms were pushing on his shoulders as if to keep water from breaking through a barrier. Adrian was clearly in control which was rare, especially considering how Adrian's normal reserve but her confidence had clearly gone up since they had first gotten together. After awhile she pulled away a bit so Rocky could see that her face was red and her lips were swollen from their passionate make out session. She ran her arms under his shirt, feeling and massaging his bulging muscles, then pulling the shirt up and over his head so she could get a good look at him. Even though she was teasing him, he wanted to let her have some fun taking a more forward role- he would make sure to keep it equal and turn the tables later on. She went to the front of her blouse and slowly started undoing the first two buttons- when she got to the third she decided to start fumbling with them a little to quicken his pulse. When she had undone all the buttons she put it to the side. She realized there was no going back now- it felt different but powerful being the one to steer their intimacy. She knew Rocky would have trouble controlling his hands from here on out so she took his hands and slid them under her thighs so that they were trapped. She started kissing him passionately again, moving her hips over his pelvis, while adding to the torture by gently rubbing her bra against his chest. She could feel he wanted to move his hands to her chest and that he was turned on under his pants but quickly moved her arms to his hands and forced them down, whispering that he needed to be patient. Since her head was already close to his, he decided to tease her in another way- he began sucking and nipping her neck and throat hard, which he knew drove her wild, especially when she whimpered his name several times aloud. She pulled her head away and started to undo her bra clasps. Once the straps fell to her shoulders, she moved her breasts out of the lacy cups and threw her bra aside. She started to touch her breasts and thumb her nipples, knowing and FEELING he was dying watching this- and he was! Usually, he was the aggressor but clearly, there was something very sexually appealing about watching his wife lead. Rocky loved her for so many reasons- his once shy wife had become more confident and aggressive in many ways which he had to admit was very attractive, especially when she occasionally showed that in the bedroom. Adrian was moaning as she touched her breasts and dragged her hips across his pants. All Rocky could do was intently watch as her nipples hardened. She stood halfway up using his shoulders to brace herself and unbuttoned and dropped her jeans, leaving her only wearing panties. As she slowly lowered herself back down, she looked him in the eyes seductively. She kissed his mouth then his chest as she unbuckled his pants. She kissed him and told him how lucky she was and suddenly he felt her hand circle his manhood. Adrian wanted to do something unexpected and please her husband- she loved him more than anything and loved surprising him in the bedroom. She slowly rubbed him up and down several times- he was in heaven, he loved her because she meant the world to him and she had him in the most vulnerable way a woman could. She stroked him, feeling his shaft swell as she massaged the base and tip. He freed his hands and had his lips on hers and his hands in her hair. She knew it wouldn't be long before he insisted on taking over so in the meantime she took his hands and put them on her breasts and then continued touching him with her hand as she picked up speed. Rocky knew he was close to plunging over the edge but he wanted them to come together. Even though he was in the throes of passion, he was incredibly selfless and aware of her needs. All of a suddenly, he fluidly flipped them over and Adrian saw pure primal desire in his eyes. He immediately took her hands and pinned them above her head. Rocky told her he loved her and that it was his turn to please her. Then he took his hand and teased her breasts- pinching her nipple, squeezing the base, breathing and licking the areole. Her mind was black, she barely even realized she was saying his name repeatedly and quite loudly, which Rocky loved to hear. Rocky was still holding her hands as he hooked his fingers under her panties and lowered them down. He started kissing her ribs and stomach and moved further down to her thighs, teasing and tantalizing the inside of her legs before his mouth closed in around her most sacred place. All Rocky could think about was how much he loved her, how ready she was and how wonderful she felt. He felt the tuft of feminine flesh swell as her teased her with his tongue and made circles with his hand. As she was crying out and getting close to climax, he quickly rose over her and slowly pushed himself into her. She was shocked by that feeling of fullness and threw her head back calling his name and grabbing his arms. He moved forward slowly and then picked up the tempo, thrusting quickly and going deeper every time. With each deep thrust, Adrian could feel her walls aching and closing in around his manhood and that's all Rocky needed to push a little harder. As Adrian cried out, her walls convulsed around him, and with that Rocky made one more thrust and then went over the edge deep within her. He rolled them onto their sides so that they were literally pressed together as their hearts slowed down and he kissed her deeply, wrapping his arms around her back. They were each other's world, they were one.","Summary":" The Honeymoon Everything had happened so quickly and Rocky and Adrian had made it through it all...","MetaData":"Rated: Fiction  T - English - Romance - Chapters: 4   - Words: 9,376 - Reviews: 7 - Favs: 12 - Follows: 6 - Updated: 5 24 2014 - Published: 9 5 2013 - id: 9662858 "},{"Movie":"Bring it On","Title":"Finding a New You","Author":"DreamerGuurrl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6198570","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Dad….why do I have to go to this school?\" Claire Edwards complained as she and her dad who was also the principal walked up the steps on the first day of school of sophomore year. \"Because I said so\" Mr. Edwards replied. He rolled his eyes at his daughter who had become very snobby in the last two years. He and his wife both decided it would be best to take Claire out of Greenland High and transfer her to Apollo High. Claire and her dad walked in the school as Claire scrunched up her nose in disgust. \"Now stop it missy! If you can show me that you will stop this little attitude of yours I will transfer you back to Greenland next semester.\" Mr. Edwards said annoyed of his daughter's attitude. Claire's face lighted up \"I promise I'll be on my best behavior dad.\" Claire promised. \"Good oh by the way I'm not your dad anymore I'm your principal now\" Mr. Edwards corrected her smiling. \"Whatever you say principal\" Claire said as she walked away to class. Claire crossed her arms against her chest thinking that maybe Apollo wouldn't be so bad after all. \" Who are you kidding Claire? Apollo High is the worst school in the county last year a girl got raped and a guy got killed.\" She thought to herself. Greenland High was rated one of the best schools in the county. So what was she the assistant captain of the Varsity Cheerleading Squad doing here at Apollo? As the day continued Claire kept on realizing how much Greenland High was better than Apollo High. First, Greenland High was kept clean and the flowers were always bright and welcoming. At Apollo the flowers were dead, trash flying everywhere, and the girls' bathroom reeked of feet and fish. At Greenland the girls' bathroom always smelled of lavender with mints at the exit. Lunch time came and Claire looked at what they had to eat. They had chili, peas, celery, and for the main entrée they had a sloppy Joe. \"Ugh you have to be kidding me\" She thought. She was used to the sushi, ceaser salad, and the smoothie and coffee stand that Greenland had to offer. Claire found a seat in the corner by herself. She slipped on her earphones as she tried to eat her food. She picked at her sloppy Joe and played with her peas. That's when a boy accidentally bumped into her table. \"Sorry\" he apologized. Claire looked up as she saw a guy in dark jeans and a black shirt with black hair. He had a light skin tone and gorgeous blue eyes. \"Ok\" Claire said. Instead of leaving the boy sat down on one of the chairs. \"So what's your name?\" he asked. \"Claire.\" She responded clearly annoyed. Who did this guy think he is sitting down with and talking to her but she had to admit she did kind of like it. \"What to cool to say your last name or something?\" he joked. Claire dropped her fork, \"fine Edwards. Happy? Claire Edwards.\" She said. He smiled. \"Name's Elli. Elli Williams\" he stated shaking her hand. \"Great…\" Claire said rolling her eyes and pulling her hand away. \"So what school did you come from?\" He asked. \"Greenland High\" She stated. \"Whoa if you were already at that rich, snobby school why did you come here to the ghetto Apollo High?\" he asked curiously. He didn't know anyone who would leave Greenland. \"Because my parents hoped I would lose this attitude I've been having. But I'm only here for the semester then I go back to more edible lunches\" She said looking at her food in disgust. He laughed. \"Hey you look kind of familiar I wonder where from?\" he said. \"I don't know\" she said. He looked at her for a moment before clapping his hands together. \"I got it you're that cheerleader from Greenland that everyone said is the bitchiest cheerleader. I heard you made a girl cry at practice is that true?\" he asked wanting to know. \"It's not my damn fault that I made her go run because she kept talking about her breakup with her boyfriend. God she was being such a cry baby. I need my girls focused not damn crying over a freaking boy.\" She said. He laughed as he looked over at Claire giving her look that gave her butterflies in her stomach. Bring! \"What's your next class?\" Elli asked getting up as Claire threw away her food. \"English with Mr. Zabera what about you?\" She asked. \"Same\" he responded. \"Cool.\" She said. \"I think we have the same classes.\" He said. \"Really? I haven't noticed.\" She answered. \"Yeah I didn't think you would notice me.\" He said. \"Sorry.\" She mumbled. Claire and Elli entered English, Claire choosing to sit in the very back and Elli in front of her. The bell rang and Mr. Zabera started class right away. 10 minutes before the class was going to end he gave them time to read. \"Psst Claire.\" Elli said. \"What?\" she said smiling. \"Want to be partners in P.E. I think we are doing the pickle ball unit today?\" The bell rang as everyone exited the room. Claire got up picking up her books. Elli turned to face her waiting for her answer. \"Sorry I have tryouts for cheerleading during P.E today\" She said. \"It's ok good luck\" he said as he started leaving the room. \"Thanks I'm going to need it.\" She said. He turned around smiling, \"No you won't\" he said as he left. Claire smiled biting her bottom lip as she hurried to get dressed out and she ran to the field. 60 other wannabe cheerleaders showed up some were decent while others words can't even describe how terrible they were. Claire felt like her tryouts were a success. She anxiously waited after school so they could put up the list. \"Number 14\" She repeated to myself. \"Hey what are you waiting for?\" Elli asked coming up behind her. \"To see if I made the team or not.\" She said. \"Ohh... You want to grab a smoothie afterwards?\" \"There's a smoothie truck around here?\" She asked desperately. \"No. There's a smoothie shop up the street. Damn you must really miss Greenland.\" He said. She nodded thinking of all her friends and her so called boyfriend. He said they had nothing to worry about but he hasn't talked to her since June. She sighed she wanted to cry she missed Greenland so much. At that moment a woman stepped outside with the list in her hands. \"Girls if your number is up on the list please come inside to receive your uniform and state what team you made.\" She said taping up the list on the window. Claire looked down the JV list and her number wasn't there. She grew worried as she looked over to the Varsity list. \"2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 21, 25, 33, 45, 52, and 58.\" Claire and the rest of the girls that made it entered. Claire approached the lady. \"Claire Edwards and I made the Varsity.\" She stated. She nodded handing her a uniform. She smiled wide as she walked outside hiding it behind her back. \"Well…\" Elli said waiting for an answer. \"I made it!\" Claire smiled. \"I knew you would I mean that wouldn't make sense if you didn't make it considering trying to make the Varsity team at Greenland High is really hard since they chose less girls.\" He stated. \"True\" Claire said as they started walking to the smoothie shop. They approached the little smoothie shop and they ordered. Elli ordered banana berry and Claire ordering strawberry watermelon. They sat down in one of the chairs they had there. They were having a nice time when some Greenland High students came in. Claire gasped instantly recognizing them as she tried to hide her face. \"Hey Elli can I borrow your hat for a minute\" Claire asked grabbing her sunglasses from her bag and throwing them on her face. \"Uh Sure. Why?\" he asked grabbing his hat and handing it to Claire who quickly putting it on hoping not to be recognized. She sank low in her seat as she watched the students grab their drinks leaving as they laughed at how bad the drinks were and cracked some jokes about Apollo High. One year ago that was Claire making fun of Apollo High.[Chapter 2] Finding A New You Chapter Two Weeks went by even though Claire was miserable at Apollo High she was glad she had Elli as a friend. It made life at Apollo much easier. He was the only reason she wanted to go to school. She loved how easy and fun it was to flirt with him and he loved to mess with her mind. She didn't want to admit it but first, she was slowly beginning to like Apollo much more and she wasn't disgusted by it much anymore. And second, she was falling for Elli Williams and hard. \"So are we sitting together at lunch or will I be eating alone?\" he asked as he waited by her locker before lunch. \"Sorry the cheerleaders are having a meeting about the game at lunch and they are making me sit with them today. Are you coming to the game after school?\" she asked hopeful. \"Hmm Football games not really my thing.\" He said. \"Oh come on! Pretty please I'll take you to get food afterwards.\" She begged. \"Fine but I'm choosing today.\" She laughed. \"I got to go catch you later!\" she said running off to the lunchroom. The Varsity Cheerleaders team had the best table in the whole school. Their table was in right in the middle of everybody so everyone could see them. Claire approaches the table taking a seat. \"Finally little Miss Edwards joining us instead of sitting with that emo boy\" the captain says. Claire rolls her eyes as the captain starts talking about gossiping about some girl who Claire thought was a slut. \" Seriously? No wonder Apollo doesn't win any cheer competitions they don't take this seriously all they care about is popularity and parties. Which isn't too bad but competitions are fun and winning is even better\" She thought. Claire spotted Elli walking in the cafeteria as he sat down at their table taking out an apple from his backpack. She didn't like that everyone thought he was emo. He wasn't he just liked dark clothes and listened to heavy metal music. He was the only one who could annoy her and she would still love it. Every time he talked to her or even said her name she would get butterflies in her stomach. She sighed thinking a guy like him would never like a girl like her. She was so glad no one knew she was the principal's daughter because she hates when people try to kiss up to her. She didn't want to tell Elli because she was scared he would be everyone else but then again Elli isn't like everybody else… Elli sat in at the table where usually Claire and he will sit but today she was sitting with the rest of the cheerleaders. That kind of made him disappointed he really loves to mess with her. He really liked her. She was his dream girl. She was smart, brave, talented, and beautiful. He glanced at her laughing at whatever jokes the cheerleaders were saying. God he loved her smile. \"What am I doing? I'm Elli Williams who everyone thinks is an emo freak and I can't like a girl like Claire Edwards. She's a cheerleader and popular. Totally out of my league. And I can't be falling for her I'm Elli I don't fall for anyone but Claire is different she's special. Ugh I really need to get out of here.\" He thought as he grabbed his stuff and leaving the lunchroom.[Chapter 3] Hey guys! I'm so sorry that I haven't been updating. I started high school like 3 weeks ago ( Yup I'm a freshie!) and my biology teacher has loaded me with homework I'll try to upload and write as often as I can. I'm sorry that last chapter was really short. I just wanted to upload what I had written. No worries this time it's longer. I really hope to have another chapter uploaded today if not then hopefully this weekend. Please review and favorite this story! P.S. I'm thinking of writing a new story. Any ideas? Finding A New You Chapter Three Elli went outside sitting down at table by a tree. He tried to think of something besides Claire but he couldn't all that came to his mind was her. \"All I have is English and P.E. next I can afford to ditch today\" he muttered to himself. He really didn't want to miss English considering Claire was in that class but he needed to get away and just breathe. Claire was making him go crazy. He grabbed his backpack as he left the school. Claire noticed Elli was gone and wasn't at the table anymore. Maybe he went to the bathroom or something Claire thought. Claire became worried and disappointed when he didn't show up to English. She was sad he wasn't there she loved when they talked. Finally the school day was over and Claire headed to the football field with the rest of the Varsity cheerleaders. Claire put on her best smile as she glanced over to the stands in hopes of seeing Elli. \"Where is he? He promised he would come\" She thought. Just as the game was about to start there he was just arriving. She shook her head of course he would come at last minute just to get her worried and to mess with her. \"F-I-G-H-T! FIGHT FOR VICTORY!\" Claire chanted with the rest of the cheerleaders. Elli gave her a smile and Claire grinned huge. \"You like him.\" Manny one of the cheerleaders said. Claire blushed, \"No I don't.\" Manny gave her a look \"Well if you don't like him he likes you. I can see it by the way you two look at each other.\" She said. Claire looked back to Elli smiling. \"Annddd touchdown! Apollo High wins!\" the announcer shouted through out the stadium. The band played the victory song as the cheerleaders did flips and cartwheels. \"Woo!\" Claire yelled as she threw her pom poms in the air. As the football players were leaving to the locker rooms one named Johnny stopped at Claire. He took off his helmet turning his head to get his hair out of his face. \"Hi\" he said. Claire smiled as he ran off the field. Sure Johnny was cute but Claire liked Elli. She looked up to him one last time. \"Let's go Claire. Are you coming?\" Manny asked her. \"Yea sure let's go\" she said running to catch up to her. Elli watched as Claire ran off with the other cheerleaders. The whole game he had been watching her and he had become a little jealous when that stupid football player talked to her. He didn't know what he said to Claire but she smiled at him. He sighed as he got up and walked towards the entrance of the school. If Claire wanted to be with that guy then he would have to let her. That guy looked like exactly what Claire should be with. He was attractive, popular and a football player. It would make more sense for Claire to date him then to be with him. He waited a good 20 minutes before he saw he come out. \"Hey\" he said. She looked up at him \"hey so what do you say we got eat? I'm starving\" she laughs as she takes his hand. He looks down at their hands smiling. \"Uh sorry.\" She mumbled embarrassed pulling her hand away. \"It's ok\" he said. He stared at her admiring her beauty. Her nose was slightly crooked but it was cute. Her lips were perfect. He imagined how it would it feel to actually kiss her. He imagined her lips would be soft and tender. They had been talking and laughing while eating when Claire decided it was time to tell him. They had known each other for a month it was only fair. \"So I need to tell you something\" she said. \"Shoot\" he said taking a sip of his water. She bit her lip nervously. \"My dad is the principal of the school.\" He choked on his water coughing. Did he hear correctly that the girl he likes her father is the principal? The same principal who is never pleased to see him in his office. \"Your dad. Principal?\" he asked. She nodded. \"Yup.\" \"Then how come you went to Greenland last year. Wouldn't been easier to have you come to Apollo last year.\" He said. \"Well my parents are divorced. So my mom lives over by Greenland and all my friends go there. So last year I lived with my mom but this year they both decided for me to live with my dad and so I had to come to Apollo for some reasons\" She stated. \"And the reasons are?\" he said wanting her to continue. \"Long story.\" She said. He sat there crossing his arms. \"I've got time.\" She smiled. \"Ok well my dad walked in on my boyfriend and me making out in my room with my boyfriend's shirt off. And then I got detention for refusing to dress out for P.E. because they messed up my schedule because I was supposed to have cheerleading but it was fixed. Then I snuck out like a million times. Next I missed curfew by a couple of hours. Oh and my dad had to go on a search to find me because I snuck out to go to a party and he dragged me home. Then I got into a fight with a girl at a football game.\" She said. \"Damn\" he said. \"So that's how I ended up here at Apollo\" she said. \"Well I think your dad and I have already grown to know each other really well.\" He joked. \"Oh really how\" she asked. \"I visit him pretty much every week. He loves our conversations\" he said wiggling his eyebrows. She laughed. \"Listen I have to ask you something?\" she asks. \"What?\" he asks. \"Was this a date or something\" she asks as she bit her lip. \"Uhh I don't know I mean I like you a lot. I hope this but it's okay if you don't think so um but\" he rambled on. She giggled. \"I like you too\" she says bumping her knee with his. He grinned. \"So does this mean we're like together?\" She smiled. \"If you want to be\" \"Then Claire Edwards seems you have yourself a boyfriend\" \"And Mr. Williams you have a girlfriend\" she giggled. She couldn't wait for school tomorrow and she could tell everyone that Elli Williams is hers and she's his.[Chapter 4] Hey! See I try to keep my promises! Here's another chapter! I was very happy with the last chapter! I plan uploading Chapter Five tonight! So be on the lookout! Tell me what you think of this chapter! Finding A New You Chapter Four \"Hey boyfriend\" Claire happily cheered as she walked to Elli the next morning. \"Hey girlfriend ready to go to class?\" he asked closing his locker. She nodded grinning as she took his hand as they walked down the hallway. \"So I was thinking maybe at lunch I should introduce to my dad.\" She said. He looked over to her giving her a look. \"I already know your dad though\" \"Yeah but he doesn't know you as my boyfriend. Pretty please?\" she asked giving her best puppy dog face. \"Really a puppy dog face? Ugh fine only because your puppy dog face is funny and kind of cute.\" He said laughing. She hit him playfully. \"Gees I said cute!\" he laughed. \"I'm beautiful not kind of cute\" she said sticking her tongue out. He squeezed her hand gently. \"Of course you are.\" Claire blushed as they arrived to Claire's first class. \"Well here we are\" Elli said. \"See you at lunch?\" she asked. He nodded. \"See you later then\" she said giving him a hug. She walked into her class glancing back seeing Elli. She smiled gesturing for him to go and not be late to class. He smiled as he walked away. He felt a little disappointed he had to wait until lunch to see her. When she made the cheerleading team her schedule changed a bit. He was happy they still had English together even if it was the only class they had together. She was all her could think about when he went to class. For some reason he thought about what she said when they first met. \" But I'm only here for the semester…\" The semester ended in 2 months. Did that mean she was still planning on leaving? When they first met Claire seemed mad but now she was happy all the time. So was she going to leave him? Elli shook the thought out of his head. All that he knew was he better cherish whatever time he had with her. At lunch Claire and Elli walked together to her dad's office. She softly knocked on the door. \"Who is it?\" he called out. \"It's me dad.\" She responded. \"Come in!\" he said. Mr. Edwards's expression softened when he saw his daughter walk in but it quickly frowned when he saw Elli behind her. \"What brings you two down to my office?\" he said glaring at Elli. \"Dad, I think you already know him but this is Elli my boyfriend\" she said smiling. He nodded his head \"I see and when did you Mr. Williams ask my daughter for a relationship?\" \"Uh just yesterday sir after the uh football game\" he said nervously. Normally the father of the girl he was dating didn't scare him but this was his principal. Mr. Edwards nodded turning to his daughter. \"Does your mother know?\" he asked. \"No I haven't had a chance to tell her yet. I was going to tell her this weekend\" she said. \"What's this weekend?\" he asked. \"Don't you remember? I'm staying with mom. She hasn't seen me in 2 and half weeks. I told you a couple days ago at dinner\" \"Oh yes.\" He said. He turned his attention back to Elli. \"Look I'm saying this as Claire's father break her heart and I will find you. I have your address and number in the school file\" he said. Elli gulped nodding. \"Yes sir. I don't plan on hurting her.\" Claire smiled. Finally she was in a relationship where she felt safe in. \"Well I let you get back to work Dad!\" she said taking Elli's hand rushing out of his office. \"See it wasn't that bad\" she said. He scoffed \"It wasn't that bad? Your dad just scared the crap out of me!\" he said. She giggled. \"Hey compared to my ex-boyfriend you got off easy.\" \"That was easy? I don't want to see hard\" he said. \"Trust me you don't\" she said. \"So I'm guessing I won't be seeing this weekend?\" he frowned \"Nope my mom is picking me up after school tomorrow but she's dropping me off Sunday evening so if you want you can come to my dad's house at like 7\" she said. \"Ok but I'll probably be late since I'm helping out my aunt at her house on Sunday afternoon.\" \"As long as you show up I'll be happy\" she said. The bell rang to go to class. \"Off to English my lady\" he said putting his arm out. \"Of course sir\" she giggled as she wrapped her arm around his.[Chapter 5] Hey for some reason fanfiction wasn't letting me upload all of chapter four so I split in into two parts! Finding A New You Chapter Four:Part Two Saturday Afternoon \"Hey sweetheart are you hungry?\" Claire's mom asked her. It was almost 1:00 in the afternoon and Claire was barely getting up the reason was she spent the whole night chatting with Elli online. Claire told her mom about her and Elli yesterday when her mom had come to pick her up and saw Claire standing outside with Elli and asked who he was. \"A little bit\" she said. She sat down as she ate breakfast with her mom. It reminded of her when last year she lived with her mom. She really did miss her mom. She couldn't text her dad when he was at the store to buy tampons. That would just be gross and weird for both of them. Also she was sure if she asked him he would say no way. Also with her mom she told her how to drive a boy crazy and how not to sound desperate. She loved when her mom told her about her past relationships and told Claire her mistakes. \"I'm going with Christy to the store want to come?' her mom asked. \"I don't think I have that much energy to go with you and Christy shopping today\" she laughed. Christy was her mom's best friend from high school and when those two shopped they shopped like crazy looking for the best deals. Claire thought that the saying shop until you drop came from when her mom and Christy shopped. Last year Claire brought one of her friends to go and when they got home they were so tired they fell asleep on the ground by the front door. \"Alright then I'll be back later then. Don't throw a party while I'm gone\" she winked. \"That was one time in eighth grade!\" she shouted as her mom headed to the door. \"And my I still can't find one of my right shoes\" she laughed. \"Bye mom!\" Claire said as her mom left. Claire sighed as she went upstairs to take a shower. She got dressed and blow dried her hair. She really didn't feel like staying home when it was so pretty and warm outside. She took a walk around the neighborhood when she saw Greenland High School. The school looked clean and well kept. She did sort of miss it but she liked it at Apollo. She sighed it was November the semester ended in two months and it looked like her Dad was pleased with her behavior. She knew her Dad told her when the semester ended he would transfer her back to Greenland but she started having second thoughts. She didn't want to leave Elli and none of her old friends had talked to her since she left. Suddenly she heard footsteps behind her. Claire turned around quickly to see a familiar face. \"Claire is that you?\" the familiar person said. \"Ben\" she breathed out.[Chapter 6] Ok earlier when I said I 'll upload Chapter Five tonight I will! Chapter Four had to be split up into two parts so don't think Part Two of Chapter Four is all uploading today because I'm not! Who knows maybe even I'll add two more chapters tonight and a new story! P.S. this doesn't count as a chapter! I hope I'm not confusing you if I am I ignore what I just said![Chapter 7] OMG it's been so long since I uploaded for this story. Sorry :/ Chapter Five \"Um what are you doing here?\" he asked nervously scratching his head. \"Nothing just visiting my mom for the weekend and you?\" she asked. This conversation was really awkward since they are pretty much exes and haven't seen or talked to each other in almost 4 months. \"You know the usual just going to see my boys\" he smirked. \"Oh that's cool\" she said. \"Yeah so how's Apollo? Is it all ghetto like they say?\" he asked \"A little bit it's really fun once you get to know it. I'm on the cheer team and have a lot of good friends and I have a\" she stopped not sure if she should tell him she moved on. \"You have a what? Listen I have to be honest here. I moved on to another girl. Maddie.\" He said waiting for her reaction. \"Maddie! As in my best friend Maddie?\" she yelled furious. Last year she sorted of flirted with him but Claire ignored it because she thought Maddie would never do that to her. \"I'm sorry but during the summer we got close and then we hooked up and\" \"During the summer? What happened to nothing will come between us I guess I shouldn't be surprised you hooked up with her. You were always checking out other sluts when we were together!\" she shouted. \"Sorry if I changed! You left me to go to Apollo and you thought I was going to wait for you? You're sadly mistaken. If it wasn't for me last year asking you out you would've been pathetic because I was the only one who asked you out. No other guy would look at you.\" He spat in her face. She cringed at his harsh words. \"Oh really is that what you think? That I can't get another guy? Well you're wrong since when I went to Apollo bunch of guys were checking me out and as a matter of fact I moved on too! My boyfriend is so much better than you! You can never compare to him!\" she said as she pushed past him. She turned around to say \"By the way you're wrong there was a lot of guys who asked me out last year so don't think you were the only one. You were just the only one to go all the way with me. There was others.\" She said smirking leaving him with his mouth wide open. Later that day she video chatted with Elli. \"So what did you do today?\" he asked. \"Horrible I ran into my ex-boyfriend today. Man he's such a fucking asswhole I swear\" she complained. \"What happened?\" he asked worriedly. This was his girlfriend running into her ex and coming home all upset. She told him the story and he frowned. \"I'll drive over there and kick his ass if you want me too.\" She laughed. \"It's ok. I miss you though.\" She said pushing her hair back. \"I miss you too.\" He said softly. \"I'm really upset about what he said. His words kind of hurt\" she said quietly picking at a flower she had grabbed that day. He frowned he didn't like that she upset. \"I'm coming over there. I'll be there soon.\" He said. She shook her head, \"No stay. I'll be back tomorrow.\" Elli tried to open his mouth to protest but he was interrupted by Claire. \"I'm tired. I'll see you tomorrow?\" she said. \"Yeah see you tomorrow.\" He said. She smiled as she logged off of chat. Wednesday at Lunch… Claire hurried to the cheerleader's table. She had gotten a text today during 3rd period to meet there at lunch. She sat down just as the captain started. \"So as you know homecoming is this Saturday and the homecoming game is this Friday\" she said. The girls chanted happily at the news but Claire was confused. \"So I'm pretty sure you girls all know the Apollo tradition.\" The captain said. \"I don't what is it?\" Claire asked. \"Oh instead of wearing our uniform at the game, one of the football players asks us to wear their away jersey and we have to accept. So on Friday we wear them to school and we are pretty much theirs for the day.\" Manny explained. \"Do we have to like kiss them and stuff?\" Claire asked. Manny shrugged, \"Whatever they want. You just have to make sure they are happy for the day.\" \"What if no one asks us?\" Claire said again. The cheerleaders laughed. \"No one breaks a tradition. Don't worry you are going to be asked right away, to the guys you're hot.\" \"Uh thanks\" Claire said. \"Well that's it meeting is over!\" the captain announced. Claire got up and walked away to go meet Elli. She wasn't looking forward to this little tradition. She didn't know how Elli was going to feel about this. Well I better go find out she thought.[Chapter 8] So sorry that I haven't updated in ages! Ugh being sick really sucks! Well now I can upload more chapters! Enjoy and let me know what you think! :) Chapter Six Claire found Elli at their usual table and smiled as she made her way over to him. \"Hey\" she said giving him a light kiss on the cheek. \"How was the meeting?\" he asked. She grew nervous, biting her lip \"uh it went good\" she replied. Eli gave her a look that she knew he wasn't convinced. \"What's going on?\" he asked her. She took a deep breath. \"Well this weekend is homecoming and as tradition one of the football players has to give me his away jersey because I have to wear it on Friday at school. Which means whoever gives me their jersey, I'm theirs for the day\" she said. \"You have to do this?\" Eli asked as he thought this was unbelievable. Claire nodded her head. \"Apparently the cheerleaders said it's Apollo's homecoming game tradition.\" She said. \"That's a bunch of bull\" Eli spat as he angrily got up. \"Excuse me? It's not like I want this but I have to do this!\" Claire shot back. \"No you don't, you're choosing to.\" He said mad. \"Well what do you want me to say? That I have to break tradition because my boyfriend is mad that I have to do this even though as a cheerleader it's required to keep the football players and school pumped for the game?\" \"Yes! There are some things as a cheerleader that you shouldn't have to do\" he replied. \"Look I know you're mad but when I joined this team I made commitment that I would do whatever it takes to make sure I as a cheerleader would try to get everyone pumped even if that means doing something I don't want to do!\" \"Wow you're unbelievable! Are you even listening to yourself speak and how stupid you sound about your responsibilities as a cheerleader?\" he yelled. Claire couldn't believe he just told her she was stupid. A good boyfriend would try and support so what the hell was going on? \"I can't believe you just called me stupid! You know what if this thing about me being a cheerleader is making you angry then maybe it's not worth being with you if you can't support what I love doing\" She shouted. His expression went sad. \"You know I don't want that\" he softly spoke. Claire's anger went away as she wrapped her arms around his waist. \"Me either. Now can we stop arguing because even though I can't be with you on Friday I'm still yours and I really want to go with you to homecoming on Saturday.\" She said giving a slight kiss on the cheek. He smiled. \"You're mine and I'm yours\" he said wrapping his arms around her. She smiled as she leaned her head against his chest. She loved to hear him say that she's his. It let her know that someone cared enough to make her his. \"Don't worry we'll have a blast at homecoming even though dances aren't my thing.\" He said. \"Good. And you better come and cheer me on at the football game\" she smiled. \"Wouldn't miss it for the world\" he replied. Later that day…. Claire was at her locker, getting ready to go home after school. Usually Eli gave her a ride home but today his car broke down so he had to go take it to the repair shop which meant Claire had to walk home today. Claire took her book and put it in her bag as she closed her locker only to get startled by someone leaning against the locker next to hers. It was Johnny who had said hi to her one day as he was getting off the field. He trying to hide a jersey behind his back but it wasn't working since Claire could see it clearly. \"Hey Claire\" he greeted her giving her a smile. \"Hi Johnny what's up?\" she asked even though she fully aware of what he was doing. \"Well I know someone told you about the tradition we have here at Apollo and I was wondering if you would like to wear my jersey on Friday\" he said showing her his white and blue away jersey. Claire took it her hands. \"Sure. This is wonderful\" she said. She only talked to Johnny a few times but Manny told her that he told Manny that he liked Claire. \"Thanks. I'm really happy you said yes. Also I was wondering if you would like to come to homecoming with me since we're going to the game together. It's kind of funny too because you see everyone thinks that we would be the perfect couple. Pretty much we would be like Hollywood's hottest couple here at Apollo\" he gave a small nervous laugh. \"Johnny, I'm flattered and shocked really but I have a boyfriend and I already said we would go to homecoming together but I'll still wear your jersey on Friday because it's tradition.\" His face fell. \"I don't get it. I thought I was getting these signals from you that you liked me too\" \"Sorry you must've been getting the wrong reception but I have a boyfriend. Eli Williams.\" She said. \"Oh I didn't know you guys were still together. He has a history for dumping girls in the first week that they get together.\" \"I'm sure that's a rumor and besides I really like him and he likes me that's why he's ok with this tradition because we're going to homecoming together\" \"Oh well that's a great.\" \"Yeah it was nice talking to you but I better go\" she said as she quickly walked away. \"Some day Claire Edwards we'll be together and you'll see Eli is no good for you\" he whispered as he made his way down the empty hallway.[Chapter 9] I'm speeding this story up because you guys deserve for this story to continue. I'm so sorry for the loooong wait! The next chapter will be the last chapter and there might be an epilogue. Finding a New You Now it was Friday and Claire smoothed Johnny's jersey as put it on. It was really big on her, so she had to tie a knot in the back of it. \"Claire, let's go!\" Her dad shouted from downstairs. \"I'm coming!\" She shouted as she grabbed her bag and headed downstairs where her dad handed her a breakfast sandwich. She arrived at school and after going to her locker she headed over to Eli's locker. She went around the corner to see Johnny and Eli in a conversation and neither looked happy. She decided to stay out of it and hide behind the wall. Eli was much shorter than Johnny so he had to sort of look up at him. Johnny had a couple of his friends behind him that Claire had guessed was his back up to make him seem scary. Eli though, did not look scared and stood his ground. Now was the time that Claire had wished she could know how to read lips. Johnny then walked away before he shoved into Eli's shoulder. Once Johnny was gone, Eli turned back to his locker and Claire walked over to him. \"What was that?\" she asked. Eli turned to her and smirked. \"He's not too happy to hear I'm taking you to homecoming, I told him we're dating so he shouldn't be mad. Then he went on and on about how we're different and we shouldn't be together.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Well I guess it's a good thing that I don't care what he says.\" She smiled taking his hand in hers. \"People like that annoy me. I'm tired of it and I'm not going to let it go. He messed with the wrong person.\" He evily smiled. Claire sighed, \"Please don't do anything that you'll regret.\" \"Trust me I won't regret this.\" He smirked as he let go of her hand and walked down the hallway. Eli walked away and found the person he was looking for. He closed his locker. \"What the hell Eli!\" said Eli's long time friend Andy. \"I need a favor.\" Eli said. Andy turned to his Eli. \"Man the last time I did you a favor we almost got suspended. I can't get my brother to come in again.\" he groaned. \"Aren't you tired of these jocks walking down these halls like they rule it? I am and one certain football player is getting on my nerves and I plan to end this once and for all.\" Eli said. Andy looked over at Eli who had a face that could scare anyone who looked at him. Lucky for him, Andy was used to it. He sighed knowing he would regret this but this was his friend. \"Alright text me the plan. By the way when is this taking place?\" he asked. Eli smiled, grimly. \"Tonight at the football game.\" he said. Andy walked away, shaking his head thinking what he had gotten himself into. Claire waited at her and Eli' s table at lunch. She tapped her foot against the table causing the table to slightly shake. Then Eli came and slid into the seat next to her, wrapping an arm around her waist. \"Hey.\" she smiled but he wasn't even looking at her but instead he glared at Johnny who was across the room. \"Claire, I have the perfect plan. And tonight at the football game it will come true. I will need your help though\" he said. \"Eli, no. Whatever you are planning I can't be a part of this.\" \"But tonight I'm going to-\" \"Forget it Eli. I'm not doing it.\" \"Are you going to do this to me? I have to do this and if you won't do this then fine.\" he muttered. \"You know Eli this is probably the stupidest thing. If you get caught you will get suspended and what about homecoming? Here's an idea why don't you just forget it.\" she spat before she picked up her books and walked away. Eli sat there but he knew that he was going to continue the plan. That night, Claire took off the jersey and put her uniform on. She glanced in the mirror. She was really hoping that Eli wouldn't do this stupid plan of his. Why couldn't he just forget about what Johnny said and just be happy that he was with her but no guys always had to be stupid and fight for what's theirs. She re-applied her make-up one last time before pulling her hair back into a tight pony tail. She took one more glance before smiling and heading out to the football game. When she got there she was greeted by the other cheerleaders. She looked around in the stands and there was no sign of Eli. Soon the game started and he wasn't there. Even though Claire was sad that he wasn't there she was happy that he wasn't there planning whatever plan he was planning. Around half-time he still wasn't there. She smiled in relief. Maybe he felt bad she thought. Had she been to hard on him at lunch? Claire decided to call him after the game to see how he was. With a minute before the game ended suddenly the power went out. Everyone whispered and screamed in panic. The football players were rushed back to their coach and the cheerleaders gathered around in a circle. It was completely dark. \"Ladies and gentleman!\" a voice boomed over the intercom. Claire froze, instantly recognizing the voice. Eli. DUN-DUN-DUN! So what did you think he will do next chapter? I tried to make it longer but I have to go back to school shopping :( ew. Review if you want the next chapter! No review no new chapter! So the next one will be the last one and then the epilogue!

Now hit it like you mean it,\" Rocky said as he steadied the bag from behind. Adrian looked up at him, feeling extremely uncomfortable standing in the baggy grey sweatsuit Rocky had pushed her into wearing. Her slender arms hung at her sides, bright red gloves dragging them down like lead weights. \"Rocky I'm no good at this. I'm not a fighter. Please let's just stop.\" Adrian mumbled as she looked down, scuffing her feet. \"Yo Adrian, you're no good because you're not trying. And don't tell me you're not a fighter. You're the toughest person I know. Now look here, watch what I do.\" Rocky came out from behind the heavy bag and came to stand next to Adrian. \"Now you gotta punch long and extend your arms if you wanna hit hard.\" Rocky said as he lined his arm up with the bag. \"Watch me,\" He said and then hit the bag with a bruising left jab. \"Now you try.\" Adrian wearily lifted her arms and gave a halfhearted attempt at a right jab, her glove glancing off of the bag and falling heavily to her side. She sighed in frustration and looked up at Rocky's face, hoping against hope that he would see that she wasn't going to get better and just drop this silly idea already. But she knew better than to think her stubborn fighter of a husband would give up so easily. \"C'mon Adrian, you can hit harder than that. I've seen you swat Paulie with more power.\" Adrian smiled despite herself. Rocky smiled back as he positioned himself behind her, grabbing hold of her wrapped wrists. He leaned down so his chin rested on her thin shoulder and pulled her left arm up by her face as he pushed the right out into the bag. \"Y'see you always gotta keep your guard up to protect your face. I like your teeth where they are.\" Rocky laughed. \"If you're supposed to always protect yourself, why do you let the other fighters hit you in the face so much?\" Adrian retorted. \"I don't know, I guess I should take my own advice.\" Rocky chuckled and shook his head. \"Let's try again.\" Rocky again pushed Adrian's fist out so it hit the bag a little harder this time. Then again. And again. Each time Adrian hit a little bit harder and Rocky pushed a little bit softer. Soon enough, he stepped back and watched as Adrian hit over and over again. His face lit up with a goofy grin as he watched Adrian's shy smile shift into a grim look of determination. Adrian's hits got harder and faster as she became more comfortable with the motions, eventually switching from right to left and back again. There was something relaxing and cathartic about pounding away at the bag. When her hands began to hurt Adrian stepped back, looking over at her husband as she wiped the sweat off her forehead with the back of her arm. Rocky looked back at his wife with a wide grin. Adrian was looking more disheveled than he'd ever seen her; pieces of hair hanging down into her eyes and sweat dripping down her temples. Her thin chest heaved under her sweatshirt as she fought to get her breath back. \"Yo Adrian, you did it. I knew you had it in you!\" Rocky said as he grabbed her in a hug and gave her a quick peck. He reached down to undo the laces of the gloves, pausing to kiss the swollen knuckles of each hand as they were exposed. Adrian glanced up from her hands to his face and stood up on tiptoes to place another longer kiss on Rocky's lips. \"Thank you,\" she whispered quietly as she kissed him once more. \"I knew you was a fighter,\" Rocky whispered back. A few weeks later Rocky was sitting in the living room watching t.v. with Butkus when he heard the front door slam open as Adrian stormed in and tossed her purse onto a side table. Rocky looked up worriedly from the screen. \"Yo Adrian, what's wrong?\" \"Ooh that Paulie makes me so mad I could just...Ugh!\" Adrian ranted as she pulled off her coat and flung it onto a chair. Rocky sat frozen but his eyes followed her as she stomped across the living room and down the basement stairs. Rocky stood up and walked over to the steps. He was just about to walk down to see if Adrian was all right when he heard the familiar rhythmic sounds of punches landing on the heavy bag. Instead of interrupting, Rocky just shook his head and smiled. \"I always knew you was a fighter.\"[Chapter 2] Rocky buying the turtles Ding. Adrian looked up from the fish tanks towards the door to the pet shop, bright orange flakes falling from her suddenly still fingers. In the doorway stood a hulking figure in a black leather jacket and lumpy black hat. The man's hands were curled loosely into fists and he seemed to be practicing punches. Adrian caught herself staring and quickly looked down at her own sensible shoes. She returned to feeding the fish, stealing glimpses of the dark stranger from between the tanks. Adrian watched as he strolled around the shop, chafing his large hands. He paused by the pen in the window, whistling and petting the puppies playing there. Adrian looked on worriedly; afraid they might be frightened by this brute, but they wriggled and nosed their way into the man's hands, fighting for room. Adrian fought to hide her smile as she moved across the shop to a solitary cage that held a giant bull mastiff. The dog had been found roaming the streets a few days ago but no one had come yet to claim him. Adrian placed a food dish in the dog's cage; looking up through her bangs at the man who had moved on from the puppies and was standing near the fish tanks. Adrian straightened and turned to the man. She fidgeted with the watch on her lapel, squaring her shoulders before lifting her chin. \"C-Can I help you?\" She stammered, not meeting the man's eyes. \"Yeah...yeah.\" The man paused, turning to face her. \"I was just lookin' to get an animal. Somethin' small though, I don't got a lotta room.\" He shrugged his large shoulders and chafed his hands again. \"Uh...well we've got some nice birds if you'd like.\" Adrian gestured over to the cages near the windows. \"Or fish are easy to take care of…\" She trailed off as the mastiff at her feet started barking. Suddenly the man crouched down, poking his fingers through the cage and letting out a loud bellowing sound. Adrian jumped as the man and dog continued to howl. \"Hey, yo buddy, how you doin' today?\" The man asked as he stroked the dog's nose through the mesh of the cage. \"Does he have a name?\" He asked without taking his eyes off of the dog. \"No, he didn't have a collar when we found him.\" Adrian answered without thinking. \"Well, a dog's gotta have a name…\" the man trailed off, looking deeply into the dog's eyes. \"How's about Butkus? Do ya like that buddy?\" The mastiff barked again, raising a paw to scratch at the cage door. \"I think he likes it. Yo Butkus!\" The dog barked again, and the man straightened from his crouch. \"Yo, you're Paulie's sister yeah?\" The man said, shrugging his shoulders. Adrian froze, surprised, then nodded minutely. \"I don't know if he ever mentioned me, but me and Paulie go way back. I'm Rocky, by the way, Rocky Balboa. And you are?\" The man waved one of his large hands in her direction. Adrian swallowed but said nothing. The man waved the extended hand again. \"And you are?\" \"Adrian,\" she whispered finally, glancing up into the man's surprisingly bright brown eyes. \"Adrian,\" Rocky said back, holding her gaze. \"Yo Adrian, I already got a fish. His name's Moby Dick, see. He's just a goldfish but he's pretty nice I guess. I dunno,\" he continued as if they hadn't been interrupted at all. He turned around and started wandering back through the pet shop, occasionally bending down and peering into tanks and cages; poking his fingers into cages and tapping on glass. \"What about a dog?\" Adrian asked, following behind him at a distance. \"Too big and too rich for my blood. I don't got much room in my place for a dog. I was thinking something a lot smaller. And cheap too. I don't got too much extra spending money. I can barely even afford to pay attention some days, you know?\" Rocky laughed and smiled back at Adrian. She looked down at the floor, feeling a smile spreading across her face involuntarily. She shook her head and composed herself before looking back up, but the twinkle in Rocky's eyes suggested that she hadn't done a very good job. \"What do you think about turtles?\" Rocky continued as he turned back to the tanks. He leaned down, looking into a tank where two turtles were submerged in a pool of water, one on top of the other. Adrian inched closer, also leaning down to look in the tank. \"Turtles are nice,\" she murmured, sliding her gaze from the tank to look down at Rocky's face as he continued to stare at the turtles. Adrian's eyes took in his strong, straight nose, full lips, and strong jaw. She glanced quickly away as Rocky looked back up at her. Rocky smiled and clapped his hands together, rubbing them briskly. \"Turtles it is. Now what does a turtle eat?\"[Chapter 3] You never told me why you really fight \"You know, you never did tell me why you fight.\" Adrian shifted her head from Rocky's shoulder to look up into his eyes. Her small arms tightened around his chest as he looked back down at her. \"Hmmm?\" Rocky mumbled as he rubbed his large hands up Adrians slim back. Adrian reached up to brush a strand of hair out of her face and burrowed her chin into Rocky's chest. \"Earlier, when I asked you why you fight, you never answered the question.\" Rocky sighed. \"Well, you know I've always been a fighter. Growin' up like I did, in the neighborhood y'know, it's a pretty rough life.\" He grimaced down at Adrian who smiled back up at him. \"There wasn't a lot to look forward to at home either, you know, so I spent most of my time out on the streets. And you know I've always been a pretty big guy, so there's always some bum who thinks he can get a reputation as a tough guy by fighting the biggest guy around.\" Adrian's face creased in a small frown. \"So, you got in trouble a lot then.\" \"Yeah, well I was never the best student, but getting kicked out of school for fighting didn't help none. I was pretty wild when I was a kid, you know. At least until I started really training to be a fighter. Before, I thought I'd probably end up in some factory somewhere. I never thought I could make a livin' fighting.\" \"So, that's the only reason?\" Adrian asked. Rocky grimaced again, rolling his shoulders to look up at the ceiling. \"C'mon Adrian, what do you wanna hear? That I hate my crummy life and my crummy apartment? That fighting's the only thing that makes me feel like I'm not a bum? That it might be my only ticket out of this dump heap of a neighborhood?\" Adrian reached up, lightly touching her fingers to Rocky's chin. He looked down, meeting her eyes. \"I think you fight because it makes you feel powerful. I think it gives you a sense of purpose. I envy that.\" Rocky pulled Adrian's fingers to his lips, kissing them softly. \"Yo, Adrian, you're stronger than you think. It takes more than guts to live with Paulie as long as you have.\" Adrian laughed and smiled wider. Rocky pulled her up farther and rolled over so they were face to face laying on the pillow. \"Hey, Adrian, did you hear the one about the butcher who backed into the meat grinder?\" Rocky whispered softly. \"He got a little behind in his work.\" Adrian's giggles were smothered by Rocky's sudden kiss. She curled her arms around his neck as he pulled her closer, deepening the kiss. After a few minutes, Adrian pulled back, panting lightly. \"I don't think you're a bum,\" she said tenderly, brushing her thumb down his cheek. Rocky just smiled back at her, shaking his head, and leaned over to kiss her lightly on the forehead.[Chapter 4] Adrian noticing Rocky in Robert Adrian loved days like this. Days when Rocky didn't have a fight and they could just stay home with Robert and be a family. Days when she'd make spaghetti, Rocky's favorite, while Rocky played games with Robert in the living room. She came out of the kitchen, wiping soapy hands off on her apron, to see Rocky and Robert both sprawled out on their stomachs on the carpet; feet waggling in the air, propped up on their elbows, pushing toy cars around the floor, making little noises as they played. Adrian watched them for a moment, their faces obscured by the same thick black hair. Adrian noticed the similarities all the time: in the way that Robert would square his shoulders when he was nervous. Or when she caught him practicing punches in the mirror over the sink when he didn't know she was looking. Adrian was pulled from her thoughts by a tugging on her apron. \"Mommy!\" She smiled down into Robert's small face, brushing the hair off of his forehead. \"What is it honey?\" she asked, glancing over to Rocky, still lounging on the carpet, surrounded by cars. There was a sly smirk on his face that made her narrow her eyes. \"Knock, Knock\" Adrian grinned and shook her head. \"Who's there?\" \"Boo!\" Robert cried. \"Boo who?\" \"Don't cry Mommy, it's just a joke!\" Robert yelled and then collapsed in uncontrollable giggling. Adrian chuckled and looked over at Rocky who was laying on his back, laughing and holding his stomach. \"Okay, wise guys. Clean up the living room, it's time for dinner.\" Adrian watched Robert walk back to Rocky and start putting away the cars. \"Hey kid,\" Rocky said, pulling Robert in close. \"What's that in your ear?\" Rocky pulled a toy car out from behind Robert's head. \"Yo, that's not a good place to keep your toys, you know.\" Robert giggled again. Adrian rolled her eyes, smiling, and turned back into the kitchen to set the table.[Chapter 5] Rocky noticing Adrian in Robert (set somewhere before Rocky V before they leave the mansion) \"Rocky?\" Adrian said as she settled down on the couch. Rocky lifted an arm, pulling her in close and placing a soft kiss on her cheek. He frowned when she didn't respond. \"Yo, why the long face?\" He asked, turning her chin up to look at him. Adrian curled deeper into his arms, crossing her own tightly across her chest. \"Oh, I'm worried about Robert. Rocky, I wish you'd go talk to him. I think he's having a hard time in school.\" \"The kid's having a tough time? Is it his grades, because honestly Adrian he's absolutely smarter than I am. I don't know if I'd be such a big help.\" Rocky shrugged. \"It's not his schoolwork, it's the other kids. I think he's lonely.\" Adrian sighed. \"I never hear about any new friends he's making, and he never brings anyone over. I'm worried. What if he has no one to talk to? That can be hard for a kid.\" Adrian trailed off and looked down at the floor, wringing her hands. Rocky smiled and kissed her cheek. \"Don't you worry about nothin'. I'll go talk to the kid.\" Rocky got up and walked upstairs to Robert's room. The door was open and Robert was sitting on his bed, reading a book. He looked up when he heard Rocky's knock on the open door. \"Hey Dad,\" Robert smiled, putting down his book. \"What's up?\" \"Ah, nuthin' kid. Just checkin' in.\" Rocky mumbled. \"Can I come in?\" \"Sure.\" Rocky came in and sat down on the end of the bed. He looked around the room, noticing the drawing board in the corner, the well organized book shelf by the window, the fight posters covering the wall. A flash of movement caught his eye and drew his attention to the fish tank behind Robert's head. Bright yellow fish swam lazily between bright leafy greens and blue stones. \"Yo, these fish are pretty colorful, you know. Did you pick these out yourself? They're beautiful.\" Robert glanced back at the aquarium. \"Mom helped me pick them out. She said they looked like candy.\" He said, shaking his head. Rocky smiled, rubbing a finger down the smooth glass. \"Yeah, she always did have a good eye for animals. You got that from her.\" Rocky laughed. \"I'm just lucky turtles are so tough. Not many animals could've lasted so long in my old place, y'know.\" Robert laughed. \"So, Dad, did you want to talk about something?\" \"Oh, yeah, well I was wondering, if you aren't busy or nothing, maybe you wanna go outside and play some ball with your old man? I tell ya, I was a mean stickball player when I was your age.\" \"I don't know, Dad. I've got a lot of homework to do still.\" Robert mumbled, picking at the comforter. \"C'mon kid, it'll be fun. We'll call your friends over, make a game out of it. Whaddaya say?\" \"I don't think so, Dad.\" Robert said quietly. Rocky put a hand under Robert's chin, lifting it up to meet his eyes. \"Yo, kid, why the long face? What? Are you ashamed of your old man?\" Robert looked away and shrugged off Rocky's hand. \"No, Dad, I'm not ashamed of you. I just don't really wanna hang out with any of my friends from school.\" He grimaced. \"If you can even call them friends.\" \"What d'you mean?\" Robert sighed heavily. \"Nothing. It's just that whenever we hang out all they want to talk about is you. They don't really like me. They just like me because the son of 'Rocky Balboa, the Italian Stallion'.\" Rocky shook his head, letting out a wearied sigh of his own. \"Yo, kid, I'm sorry. You know I never want to hurt you right? You're number one. Home Team, right?\" Rocky held out a fist. Robert hesitated a minute before bumping it back. \"Yeah, home team.\" \"Now listen, I know you don't wanna hang out with those bums from school, but isn't there anyone at that school that you like?\" Robert looked thoughtful. \"Well, there is this girl in my math class that I think is nice. She's really smart and pretty. But she'd never notice me. She sits in front of me in class but I don't think she even knows who I am.\" Rocky chuckled. \"Y'know, your mother put me through the same thing when we first met.\" Robert brightened a little, looking up. \"Nah, really?\" \"Oh yeah.\" Rocky leaned back, stretching out his arms. \"You're a lot like her, you know. Very smart, very careful. You're thinkers, the both of you. Me, I'm more of a 'punch first, think later' kind of guy, you know.\" \"Anyway, when I first met your mother, she was working at the pet shop back in the old neighborhood. At first, I would stop by just to be nice to Paulie's sister. But she was so shy I couldn't ever get her to even look at me. Every day, I'd come by and I'd tell her a joke and every night I'd go by and tell her a joke. And she'd just stand there, silent, like I was a plate of leftovers.\" Robert laughed. \"But you know what. Even though she never said anything, wouldn't even look at me, every once in a while I'd see her glance up when she thought I wasn't looking. And sometimes, when I told a particularly bad joke or made a fool out of myself and just wanted to give up entirely, I'd see this tiny, tiny smile on her face, so small I thought I was just seeing things.\" Rocky looked to the door, smiling to himself. \"But I knew, kid. I knew the first minute I seen her that your mother was the best girl in all Philly.\" He paused, pulling Robert into a hug. \"And she gave me the best kid in the whole world.\" He leaned in to plant a big sloppy kiss on Robert's cheek. \"Daaaaad! Gross.\" \"I love ya, kid.\" \"Love you too, Dad.\" \"So what I'm saying is drop those bums, and don't give up on this girl.\" Rocky looked up at the ceiling, trying to be serious and failing miserably. \"Y'know I think I've got a math joke you could use…\" Robert grinned. \"Oh, yeah?\" \"What does the Little Mermaid wear?\" \"I don't know, what?\" \"An algae-bra!\"","LastChapter":"Rocky noticing Adrian in Robert (set somewhere before Rocky V before they leave the mansion) \"Rocky?\" Adrian said as she settled down on the couch.

Please enjoy! :) ) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: Ginger sighed dreamily as she gazed out over the lush, green hills of thernnew 'Chicken Sanctuary', based upon the spontaneous surrounding of land of arndiscovered abundant island which anyone would have craved a photographicrnpicture or would have at least, for the adventurous type, would have loved tornexplore it's deep, delving trees or walk among it's sweet scenting flowers andrnnatural green grass. To many of the chickens that now lived here, it was a refreshing change fromrnthe deep, dark and mysterious confounds of Tweedy's Farm, where many stillrnsuffered from their imprisonment and of course, the lingering fear that everyonernalmost shared there...together. Nearly everyone had begun to settle in on the island, making the most ofrnbuilding new huts around the clusters of overgrowth and tall trees thatrnforested the darkness of some areas. These had been properly checked over andrnmade sure that the settlements were perfect. The chickens, having slept in hutsrnfor most of their days, had grown quite attached to their embankments and couldrnnot bear to sleep in anything besides that alone. Mac had fully calculated the figures of each individual hut, and everythingrnhad been normal once again. It was like a new rebuilt structure that belongedrnto the chickens and nobody else, except for Nick and Fetcher. The two ratsrnfeebly made excuses to why they really followed the others here, all aboutrnloss of eggs and how they needed them to start their own business. Thernchickens, though many despised the two, knew that they were nothing withoutrnthem, even though how much the rats denied it. Plucking a pearl-white daisy from the grassy mound that she sat upon, Gingerrngave another deep sigh. She thought back to the days when her and all of herrnfriends faced terror, anxiety and even the cold shadow of death when they stillrnremained back on the farm. Ginger could never get used to it, no matter how manyrnof the others had blended in so quickly. To her, it had seemed like a dark,rndamp dudgeon, only it was outside. The young hen remembered her first day she had thought of escape...when shernproceeded to climb onto her hut to sit with her thoughts. That's when shernlooked out, and saw the hills. Those green hills. Ginger could never rememberrnthe last time she had seen such a brilliant green before...that green...it justrnseemed like an answer to her prayers...so far away but she had faith she wouldrnreach it...someday. And now she had. Beginning to pick the tiny petals from her flower, she thought back to whenrnshe finally had found the answer to her prayers. Her friends, including herselfrnhad tried every plan in the book to get to freedom, but none prevailed. Shernwould often battle to sleep on many dreary nights, trying her hardest to thinkrnof new ideas, when the others began to lose hope. Sometimes it led herrnfrustrated to tears, praying and praying for the whole coop to be pitied andrntaken away to a far, far land where they could be happy and contented, withoutrnsecrets and missions and hard labour they went through every day. But all that had changed when Rocky entered the farm and into her life. Hernseemed like the perfect solution to her problems, even though he lied plenty arntimes and conjured cheeky remarks like no tomorrow. But none of that mattered anymore. She had helped the others to freedom, shernhad stepped upon the heavenly soft grass she had often thought about in herrndreams, and she had found Rocky. Rocky… she rolled the name over in herrnhead. She was lucky to have met him, never mind him managing to steal away herrnheart. And Ginger thought her heart had only belonged to these hills of hers.rnBoy, was she wrong. Love had tampered strangely with Rocky and her...it was pushing themrntogether so quickly she didn't even have time to realise what was happening tornher. He was charming and handsome, sympathetic yet amusing. His sweetnessrnhardly entered until he discovered love also, complimenting Ginger on how prettyrnshe was and how much he loved her. I love you... every time thosernthree words came from him it made her tingle all over. She knew he was tellingrnthe truth this time…his words spoke with feeling and intensity. I lovernhim too, she told herself mentally. I've always loved him. And I alwaysrnwill. Ginger smiled down at the field below as she picked off more petals. Many ofrnher closest friends, Mac, Babs, Bunty...most were now proud mothers of littlerngrowing chicks. One, two, five...maybe more. Ginger wasn't counting. She wasrntoo much concerned about her own future. After all, she was the only henrnon the island with a steady boyfriend. The others had all laid their ownrnchildren singularly, without a rooster to help. Ginger didn't know what tornthink of it all without Rocky there with her. The young hen had gone through a difficult childhood, hardly remembering herrnparents, forgetting their names, what they looked like...it felt like she hadrnbeen abandoned...she had no memory of them at all. Sometimes she had wished forrnthem to arrive at the farm and take her away from it all, of course keepingrnthis a secret from the others. But they had never arrived, and somewhere in herrnbrave heart Ginger had known they wouldn't. Sadly, she plucked the final petal from her daisy. I don't want myrnchildren to end up like me, she thought to herself miserably. I wantrnthem to remember their parents, not forget them the way I did. Childrenrnwere another reason why Ginger wanted to flee so badly. Starting from a veryrnyoung age she had stuck onto the idea, although at the farm it was impossiblernto try. Frightened from the beginning, she avoided conversation of chicks asrnmuch as she could, but as time expanded she craved it, how it would feel to berna mother, watch them play...grow...have children of their own. Now she was finally free to do all that, but she wasn't so sure on how Rockyrnwould take it. During their relationship, children had never sprung up once, sornGinger wasn't sure on how he would react if she asked him about it. The thoughtrnalways scared her, so she tried to erase it from her mind, though many times itrnwas hard. Dropping the plant stalk onto the grass, she sighed another time. She shouldrntry and be happy for everyone else, not always worrying about her needs.rnShe may not have children right now, but then again...the thought was alwaysrnnice, wasn't it? She was just ready to rise to her feet when a friendly, yet deep voicernaddressed her. \"Hey Ginge!\" it sounded out. Ginger immediately stayedrnwhere she was. Rocky, was her only thought. Ginge, hmm? Sweetrnnickname. Better add another one to the list. I have a funny feeling that thisrnone's growing on me, though... She straightened up through her thoughts and spun around to see him stridingrnover towards her, his ever-cheeky grin plastered onto his face. That smilerncould make the icecaps melt, she pondered dreamily, presenting a beamingrnreply to his approach. I could spend all day with him. Rocky let out a satisfied exhale as he crouched down to a sitting positionrnnext to her on the mound. He brushed back his red comb before smiling at herrnonce more. Rocky, though trying to forget about the most of his past,rnespecially at the circus, could never stand the moment when he could get arnlittle attention. He always liked to be the party rooster, socializing withrneveryone and telling jokes when anyone felt down. Due to his crowded audiencesrnevery performance he took, he had developed a habit of being rather vain...butrnnowadays most roosters were anyway. They liked their pride and took greatrnmatters in their appearance. But Rocky wasn't all good looks and charm. He still kept hisrnsweet-sided nature in the pit of his personality, which made Ginger feelrnspecial and wanted. She adored the way he didn't always ask questions aboutrnhimself or always think about himself, but liked to know what other people werernthinking too. Hardly any male chickens actually lived up to that fact, butrnRocky was a fool in love. Since he'd known Ginger, his whole world had turnedrnupside down. \"Whatcha doing?\" he asked half-politely, sitting back a little andrnmaking himself comfortable on the grass. He too looked down upon the strewnrnisland of chickens and flowers, now that the sun was high in the sky; manyrnmothers and their youngsters were either sitting together and talking, or kidsrnwere busy playing with one another. It was a serious change to what Rocky remembered the scene before appearedrnto them. He didn't like to admit this, especially to the others, but he hadrnpitied them almost while at that farm. Particularly when he told himself hernwere to leave and never return. Geeze, it was creepy back there, hernthought to himself privately, No wonder those guys wanted to leave so fast. Rocky was almost similar to the others, with one exception. He was anrnAmerican who had landed into a British world. He had been used to all the namesrnthe old rooster Fowler had presented at the farm; 'Yank', 'Whippersnapper' andrnsome others. But he didn't really mind...not anymore. Ginger giggled a little at his question. \"Not much,\" she repliedrnsoftly. \"Just thinking.\" Of course I've been thinking, she told herself bitterly. I've been thinking about everything. Probablyrnevery thought that's passed through my mind since I've been at the farm. Butrnhow can I explain all of that to Rocky? Sighing gladly, she shut her brightrngreen eyes and was soon deep in thought. Rocky chuckled. \"Looks like it's something interesting, eh?\" \"You could say that.\" There was a silent pause between the two of them. Ginger knew it wasrnsomething interesting…possibly the most interesting part was her mixedrnfeelings. Something deep within was telling her that she was finally ready tornsettle down and have a proper family...but another side of her was asking ifrnshe really were ready. She was one of the youngest hens on the farm, andrnprobably the only one without children. She felt very slow and behind thernothers, and wondered when her turn would arrive. Maybe Rocky doesn't wantrnchildren, she thought unhappily. He's never mentioned it before, so herncan't be too keen on the idea. Maybe he's not ready either. Rocky curiously watched her as she thought quietly to herself. His deeprnbrown eyes fixed on her face, watching her think. Shoot, she's pretty, hernsilently pondered. Yeah, I know she keeps denying it, but man. Is she everrnwrong. She's the cutest girl I've seen in my life. What were the chances I'drnland in that place and get to know her? I wonder what she's thinking about? Ginger sensed Rocky's eyes on her and snapped out of her thoughts.rn\"What?\" she asked him sweetly. \"What is it?\" Rocky raised his eyes upwards and cleared his throat adorably. \"Nah...Irnwas just wondering what it actually was that ya found sorninteresting,\" he said truthfully, rubbing the back of his neck as hernspoke. Then his cheekiness broke in. With a mischievous grin, he scooted overrnto Ginger and put his wing gently around her. \"Were ya thinking about me?\" he asked, his rich voice as sweet as honey. Blushing a little, Ginger tried to push him away playfully. \"M-rnmaybe...\" she stuttered out in embarrassment, trying to avoid Rocky's darkrneyes as they asked her his bold question over and over again. The young hen'srncheeks grew warmer as Rocky tightened his grip. \"Will you let go?\" \"Not unless ya tell me.\" \"And what if I don't?\" Rocky smirked. \"Then you're stuck with me 'till ya do.\" \"Rocky! That's not fair!\" Ginger squealed, trying to escape fromrnhis grip. \"No-one said life was gonna be fair, Doll-face.\" Ginger gave him a friendly scowl. I thought I told him not to call mernthat anymore, she reminded herself. But maybe it's another nickname thatrnseems to have grown on him instead of me. I guess I'll have to get used to it. Holdingrnin her laughs, Ginger once more tried to pull away. \"Rocky, please…\" she giggled softly. \"Are ya ready to tell yet? C'mon, I wanna know!\" \"I-I don't know...stop being nosey!\" \"C'mon, Ginge. Can't ya tell me anything?\" This reply didn'trnsound like a joke. There was a strange tone of understanding and wonder in it,rnthe kind of voice he used when he was being serious, when he wanted to know therntruth. Halting her struggles, Ginger turned to stare into his face. It wasrnmeaningful and handsome, now his eyes asking a different question. Oh, Rocky, she thought guiltily, You know I can tell yourneverything. You don't need to ask me that...I-I just couldn't tell you then. Itrnneeds some time, that's all. Some time. Ginger swallowed hard as she stared honestly into his eyes. \"Of course,\" she answered truthfully, resting her head onto his shoulder. She couldn't helprnfeeling sorry for him. \"Of course I can. You know that.\" Butrncan I tell him how I've been thinking of children? What if he doesn't take tornthe idea? There was a small silence before Rocky asked; \"Sure?\" \"Yes.\" \"Positive?\" \"Yes.\" \"O.K,\" Rocky cleared his throat again before he began his nextrnquestion. \"Then what do ya look like without your hat?\" C'mon,rnGinge. I wanna see. I never see ya without it. Darting up, Ginger gazed at him in astonishment before letting out a chokedrncough. \"What?\" Rocky's tone grew playful and pleading as his eyes scrunched up withrndesperation. \"Pleeeaasse?\" he begged cheekily, hugging Ginger closer,rnexpecting an answer. \"Please let me - Ginge! I never see ya without thatrnhat on! C'mon, can't ya take it off?\" Ginger gave another giggle before once again trying to push him away.rn\"No! Rocky, that's a silly question! Of course I can't!\" \"Why not?\" \"Because...it's for reasons...oh, I don't even know why you're askingrnme this!\" she blurted out. \"'Cause I wanna see!\" \"Well, you're not going to!\" she responded huffily, folding herrnwings in annoyance and turning her head away from him. Did he set this uprnsomehow? Ooh...sometimes he knows all the right things to say to butter me up!rnIt's ridiculous! She suddenly heard her boyfriend's sly tone. \"Oh, yeah?\" I'verngotta see her without that stinkin 'hat! he told himself mentally. It'srnthe only dang thing she's keeping from me. Little did Rocky know that thatrnwasn't all that Ginger was hiding. She kept secrets within her...secrets thatrnshe did not wish to share at the moment. Following his thoughts, the youngrnrooster took his wing away from Ginger and snatched her green woven hat off herrnhead with remarkable speed. \"Got it!\" he declared triumphantly. At this, Ginger immediately placed her wings to the top of her head, as ifrntrying to protect something. \"Hey!\" she protested shrilly, her voicernsqueaking. \"Rocky!\" \"Yeah?\" She tried to hold in a stifled laugh as she snatched for her hat. \"Givernit back!\" \"You forgot 'please'!\" \"All right, then! Give it back... please!\" \"Why?\" he teased playfully, spinning it around on his feather tornannoy her, his expression smug and mischievous. \"I think ya look cuternwithout it.\" It was true. To Rocky, Ginger didn't look any different. Hernstill thought she was the most beautiful hen on the island...he didn't care howrnmuch she tried to correct him about it, saying some others were more attractivernthan she'll ever be. She's just too modest, he thought. She's thernprettiest thing I've seen in my life. \"Rocky! You promised!\" she argued back, trying to cover up herrnshyness at his compliment. \"Nah, I didn't,\" he replied calmly. \"Well...it sounded like it!\" Ginger struggled for arncomeback. I mean it...if he doesn't hand it over soon...oh, nobody's seen mernwithout that hat! I've got to make him give it back! Rocky just smirked. Ginger, still covering the top of her head with onernwing, tried to stretch out with her other to reach it, just as Rocky began tornlean away from her teasingly, so it was within touch and out of bounds. She couldn't help it. Ginger started to laugh her pleasant giggle.rn\"Rocky...\" she strained playfully. \"Rocky…\" \"Yeah?\" \"Please can I have it?\" \"No!\" Rocky shut his dark eyes and laughed hard in Ginger's face.rnGinger's heart melted at the sound of it, but now wasn't the time. Trying notrnto smile, she pretended to pout slightly. Rocky still continued to chuckle.rn\"Not a chance, Doll-fa-Whoa!\" For that moment, Ginger had seen herrnlast option of grabbing back her hat and went for it while Rocky still had hisrneyes closed. Now they opened wide as Ginger dived for her belonging, only torncause a dysfunction in balance. \"Ohhh!\" Ginger wailed aloud as she fell straight on top of Rocky,rncausing the two to tumble down the grassy mound towards the field below. Bothrnwere laughing hard; it wasn't a long drop down the hill. They clutched at eachrnother as they rolled over and over toward the bottom, still fighting betweenrnthem to snatch away the hat. Now they had lost all ability to talk from theirrnlaughter, but yet still trying to keep up each one's side of the challenge. Bump. Both chickens landed softly into the thick, smooth grass,rnGinger finally resting on top of Rocky, pinning him to the ground, bothrnshutting their eyes in hilarity and laughing as hard as they could, Ginger nornlonger with her wings protecting her head but lying on Rocky's chest. Shernpresented Rocky in a whole new different light, him at last seeing hisrngirlfriend without her precious hat. Shoot, she still can look hot withoutrnthat hat. I dunno why she was trying to hide this from me. She'll always bernpretty. The laughter dying to weak giggles to save breath, Rocky gazed at Gingerrnseriously in the pit of her eyes. \"Y'know...\" he began sweetly,rn\"Ya really know how to lift a guy off his feet.\" Ginger smiled shyly, the blush coming back to her cheeks. \"You're notrnso bad at it yourself, flyboy,\" she whispered gently. \"Well...exceptrnfor the 'guy' part,\" she added hastily and with a little laugh ofrnembarrassment. A slow silence followed, as the two continued to stare into each other'srneyes. Then finally Rocky spoke up. \"Erm...ya forgot your hat,\" hernjoked adorably, lifting the fallen object up off the grass and handing it overrnto Ginger with a cheeky grin. Ginger sighed to herself as she kindly took it out of his wing with a softrngiggle. \"Thank you,\" she replied sweetly, fingering it slowly andrncarefully as she smiled down at him. I don't need to ask him about thosernthings right now, she told herself. Not now. Not when everything is asrnperfect as this. Rocky shrugged cheekily. \"You're welcome,\" he answered deeply, hisrnbrown eyes lighting with mischief. Both of the couple shutting their eyes in unison, they both slowly leanedrntogether to join the other in a loving kiss. As it grew deeper, Rockyrnunhurriedly reached out a wing and took careful hold of Ginger's neck scarf,rnslowly and gently pulling her in closer to strengthen the kiss. Ginger returnedrnit with no objection. Both hearts yearning together, each one said the same similar sentence. Right here...now is perfect. This is where we need to be...together...forever. {To be continued} :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: I know! This was a bit of a romantic scene, but I love writingrnthem! I promise it won't always be this way, I will add some different genresrninto the story. Please review! I want to know what you think!)[Chapter 2] Arrival by Night (A/N: O.K, second chapter up! I'm sorry if the last one went on for quite a long time, this one is a little more promising, and it actually begins to go somewhere. I'm grateful for at least getting one review! Really, I don't mind. At least it wasn't a flame, I don't mind getting those but as long as they're not too bad. I'll be writing the third chapter soon!) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: Night was now beginning to fall among the sanctuary, and most of the hens and their chicks were thinking about making their way to bed. It was always a funny sight for anyone to see, children complaining that it was still too light, trying to tug away from their parents as they were almost forced into the huts. Often, especially for the little ones, it usually ended up in tears, or some form of harsh argument, which then decided to leave for punishment. But as soon as the chicks were at rest, quiet descended on the island. The silence of the night was a time that many enjoyed, for it held quiet comfort and solitude, the peacefulness was wonderful, though many up goers were held responsible for any loud noises or as Fowler said; 'Improper respect for other's slumber, raising uncanny clatter.' So it was usually on your head be it if so much as a shout disturbed the chickens and Nick and Fetcher from trying to sleep. Recovered from the escapade on the grassy hill, Rocky and Ginger were still sitting out on the ground, in a corner of the island not too far from the water. Ginger had insisted of sitting out here tonight because it was one of her favourite spots. They could see the soft, hazy moon reflecting down on the water, causing it to become shattered as it rippled along the calm waves. It was rather a cold night, with a gentle breeze blowing along the grass and causing it to twitch, but neither chicken suggested on going back to their hut. Ginger had been so happy when Mac had recommended for her and Rocky to both share a hut together that she was absolutely speechless. It was either that or to hide the fact that a sudden blush had arrived to the young hen's cheeks, which would have made her tone of voice sound embarrassed and rather squeaky. For this, Mac had extended their shelter to be twice as wide, and added with a sly look that it was mainly for 'oncoming visitors', which caused Ginger's blush to grow twice as strong and a slight giggle to escape. She still was a little uncertain about the subject of children. What would Rocky think if she just suddenly asked him about what names he liked? She didn't even know if he was keen or not...in fact, she wasn't quite sure herself. She didn't want to lose what she already had, and she didn't want to make it worse for the both of them either. She was unsure about how Rocky would react...if he grew embarrassed, or cross, maybe even too happy that it darted Ginger away from the idea. I don't want him to think I'm rushing into everything, she thought to herself. We haven't really been here that long...what would he wonder if he knew I was thinking about children already? I'm being silly about the whole thing. Like I've said, it just needs some time. I don't know why I worry. \"You're thinking again,\" came a playful deep voice from her side. Ginger didn't even know her eyes were shut until she felt them opening in surprise. She jumped a little in shock and darted her green eyes towards the sky mindlessly. Rocky. He's gotten so used to me now, he knows me inside out, she told herself mentally. I didn't even know he was watching me. I was a million miles away. \"What?\" she asked quietly, pretending as if she hadn't a clue what her boyfriend had just said. Rocky smirked cheekily. \"Ya are, aren't ya? Knew it. That's why ya looked as if ya was in your own little world, dreaming about me...and life...and stuff...and me...\" Ginger laughed gently at Rocky's sentence. How that he never runs out of jokes is beyond me. she thought as she turned to look at Rocky with a sweet smile. \"How do you know what I'm thinking about?\" she wondered sweetly. \"C'mon, it's not that difficult to tell, is it? I mean...you've got this faraway look...\" Rocky pulled a ridiculous face, trying to imitate Ginger. He crossed his brown eyes awkwardly and presented a mischievous grin. \"See? I'm thinking now...'bout stuff...hold on...\" Ginger began to laugh again. \"I do not look like that!\" she sniggered harmoniously, hitting Rocky playfully on the wing, causing him to break out of his impersonating trance and laugh along too. Ginger loved to watch Rocky laugh. He just makes me want to melt down from the heat. she pondered. I love the way his eyes scrunch up...gosh, he's handsome. No wonder people love hearing his jokes. \"Well, you were the one who begged to sit here,\" Rocky said, still smiling playfully, tearing up a blade of grass. \"Who was the one who dragged me away from a nice, soft bed, and said; \"Oh, Rocky! Let us sit out by the water's edge! Let us bask in the glorious rays of the moonlight!\" All while Rocky was imitating Ginger's words, he sent his voice up to an annoying high pitch, which sounded irregular and cracked in places. Ginger laughed as she placed her wings over her ears. \"Stop, please! It's horrible!\" she joked. Rocky pretended to sulk and look rather hurt. \"Aw, c'mon. My voice ain't that bad.\" \"It was...just then!\" \"It can't be any worse than Gramps!\" Rocky shot back rudely, referring to Fowler during a time when he wanted to do nothing more than rant and rave, about his days back in the R.A.F and now...how he helped in the rescue mission of his fellow chickens. The young hen tried not to laugh but she couldn't help herself. \"I'll tell him that you said that!\" she giggled, her bright green eyes lighting up in harmony. \"Who cares?\" \"You will, when he finds out!\" \"Yeah, right,\" the rooster sighed as he threw the remains of his torn blade of grass over his shoulder and staring at Ginger as if he had just struck onto something funny. \"You're telling me about people finding out about stuff? What about you and your precious hat, huh? Tell me that!\" His brown eyes darted to her head, where her hat now sat firmly in place. What was the deal in her taking it off? he wondered curiously to himself. It wasn't that much of a problem. I still think she looks cute without it, no matter what she says. Ginger followed Rocky's gaze to the top of her head, placing a wing over her green woven hat for protection, just in case he tried another attempt to steal it. She had picked it up after the hill and was planning on keeping it where she believed it belonged. \"Yes, well...that's different,\" she remarked huffily, though trying not to blush as she caught Rocky's stare on her. \"You weren't supposed to see me without it.\" \"Why not?\" Rocky fired back adorably, his question catching Ginger by surprise. It took a while for her to find words to fit. She opened her mouth but then shut it again, trying to think of a decent answer. How can he always find something to say back to people, no matter what the question? she thought in frustration. He's so witty...he just says the first thing that comes into his head. Oh, if I don't think of something to say soon he'll take over the conversation again... Rocky was just about to share his winning comment when Ginger suddenly interrupted him with her own. \"It's just something that shows who I am,\" she told him softly. \"A sort of symbol, I suppose. It's just what others know me by.\" Her own answer even astonished herself. Did I really say that? Is that even true? I don't know what others know me by...but I hope to the high heavens that it's not this godforsaken hat! She laughed again at Rocky's speechless expression. \"They shouldn't, Ginge,\" he said in his rich voice, his tone sounding sincere. \"I know I don't just know ya by a hat. You're more than that to me.\" Much more, he thought privately. I think that she's the only chick I've ever fallen for...excluding the crushes and all that garbage...but somehow...this feels like it's...what people call it. The right...or real thing. Something like that. Ginger's heart fluttered inside at her boyfriend's words, leaving her feeling as if she were on fire. \"Oh, Rocky - thank you,\" she murmured shyly, staring at the grass mindlessly and pulling up a blade of her own. She remembered how Rocky had looked at her without her hat. Sort of surprised...but enchanted all at the same time. He really does see me more than what some of the others do, she thought to herself happily. He doesn't know me as just a leader. He knows me as Ginger. Some of my closest friends do too, but Rocky is somewhat special to think that. I don't know why. The young rooster smirked slightly as he watched Ginger tear the blades of grass in embarrassment, trying to avoid his eyes as her cheeks burned. \"If ya keep doing that, ya won't have any grass left,\" he joked kindly, taking her by the wing to halt her actions, for she was now ripping the blades into tiny pieces, and then ripping those into even smaller ones. Gasping in astonishment, Ginger noticed the torn meadow in her wings and hurriedly dropped them back down to earth. She still felt quite shy from Rocky's earlier comment, even though he spoke it about nearly a minute ago. I've waited my whole life for my feet to be on this grass, she thought crazily. And I'm treating it like I don't need it anymore. Rocky's right. If I keep doing this I won't have any more left. I'm being ridiculous...I bet Rocky thinks that too. She flushed a little dimly this time. \"I'm being silly again,\" she smiled weakly, fingering the grass this time with a feather instead of pulling it up. Rocky sighed in sympathy and rolled his eyes at her. She doesn't half make people feel sorry for her, he pondered caringly. It's just this look she gets, like as if she's done something wrong. Cheer up, Ginge. Scooting over to her side, he put his wing around her comfortingly and hugged her close. \"Come here,\" he breathed in his deep, kind voice, hoping Ginger wouldn't burst into tears at his words. He gulped before speaking. \"You're not being silly, Ginge,\" he remarked charmingly. Ginger laid her head onto his shoulder; feeling wanted and loved more than she'd ever done in her life. All of that time she had been in the farm and dreamed of her parents...the way she wished they would burst into the hut and proclaim that they were taking her home, away from all of the torture and pain of the fear she experienced. She remembered that her first friend she had made there was killed within a few hours. Ginger hadn't even asked for her name. That memory seemed to burn into Ginger's head like no other, and she couldn't rid of it. That was the first time she had realised the danger she was living in. She shuddered a little at these disturbing thoughts, her head still resting on Rocky's shoulder. Rocky grinned. \"Cold?\" \"No. No - not really.\" \"But you're shivering.\" \"I am?\" \"Yeah, ya are.\" \"Not from the cold,\" Ginger added hastily, hoping that Rocky would leave the subject where it was and not continue it any further. In truth, she was hotter than she'd ever been this night. She snuggled down further, trying to make it look like she was warm enough as she was. \"Then...what from?\" Rocky asked in confusion. \"Never mind,\" Ginger said shortly, hoping that he wouldn't press it further for another second. She shut her green eyes and settled in the silence, the breezes were hardly up and they seemed to have dropped as soon as Rocky had asked her if she were cold. How ironic, Ginger giggled to herself under her breath. Things seem to come your way when you least expect it. Rocky just sighed sweetly. \"Shoot,\" he mumbled to himself quietly. \"I'll never understand girls.\" His wing hugged Ginger closer to him, maybe not from the cold but more from protection. Rocky had to admit that he never liked the idea of another rooster getting close to his girlfriend. He didn't mean to be the jealous type, but somehow resentment always overpowered him. He heard the sound of Ginger's protest. \"Rocky! I said I wasn't cold!\" Ginger had felt his grip tighten and she wondered if she had been shivering still. She looked up into his handsome features with bemused eyes, wondering what was troubling him. He seems so quiet tonight, she told herself thoughtfully. So quiet. He's trying to hide it with his usual jokes, I can see. What's he really thinking? She felt her expression narrow itself in sympathy as she noticed how troubled he suddenly seemed to be. \"Are you alright?\" she asked in a kind, sweet voice, almost a whisper as it contained some of her deepest feelings. \"Hmm? Oh, yeah,\" Rocky answered casually, releasing his grip a little on Ginger, suspecting that she had felt his protectiveness for what he had actually thought. He cleared his throat again and drove his gaze up to the stars absent-mindedly. She can always tell when something's up, he said to himself. It's like some sort of thing with chicks. How come girls can do it, but not always guys? Sometimes life isn't fair. He chuckled to himself a little, sharing his own thoughts. \"What?\" Ginger pondered gently, watching him laugh beside her. \"What's so funny?\" \"Oh, nothing.\" \"Rocky - please tell me,\" she begged, hoping against hope that he would, and stop hiding these sorts of secrets from her own will. So much as I can say, she reminded herself angrily. I thought I told myself to tell him sometime soon. I actually planned on explaining it to him tonight. And I haven't gotten anywhere! I suppose my nerves are getting the best of me. Every time I think about bringing it up, I feel sick. Rocky looked down at her with a deep sigh. As usual his heart pitied for the young hen, her bright green eyes glistening up at him as though she was almost expecting to bust into tears. The rooster's heart contracted with emotion, the expression being far too painful. He shifted a little and gulped in a way that made Ginger smile. \"I can't, Ginge,\" he finally muttered. \"Why ever not?\" \"Because...\" he strained his hardest for a reasonable answer. \"...I forgot.\" Ginger couldn't help it. She had to release a soft, comforting laugh, which rang through the breeze at a beautiful tone. It made Rocky feel a lot more comfortable and less fidgety, which he was immensely grateful for. He chuckled handsomely so that their laughs echoed in the night sky. \"I should think you have!\" Ginger giggled gently, hugging Rocky close, completely forgetting her whole wanting of need for the answered question. \"The time it took for you to tell me...no wonder you can't remember - \" Her eyes widening, she trailed off, suddenly glancing at him quite suspiciously, staring at him as if she had uncovered something. She gave him a tease of a glare. \"Or can you?\" she wondered slowly. \"What?\" Rocky was completely at a loss. Instead of a sneaky comeback as he was expecting, Ginger just gave him a pleasant beam. Always acting so innocent. Don't play this one on me. \"I can never tell what a Lone Free Ranger thinks of in his spare time,\" she concluded, sighing softly through her words, taking heed to notice how bight the stars were in an excuse to avoid Rocky's dark brown eyes, which were making her set alight from the inside. Rocky gave her a cheeky grin. \"What do ya think?\" \"Oh, be quiet,\" Ginger teased, playfully reaching up a wing and ruffling Rocky's red comb as a joke. Sometimes he can say the rudest things, but he still manages to bring a smile out of me. I'm sure that he wasn't thinking about anything too offensive. She let out another harmonious titter as she witnessed her boyfriend's dishevelled appearance. The strands of his comb stuck out at odd angles and gave Rocky sort of a laid-back style, untidier than usual. Rocky however, didn't find her act amusing. With a small, shocked look crossing his face mildly, he reached up his wings to his comb and felt about frantically. Doesn't she understand how I feel about these sorts of things? he thought hysterically. Geesh, it takes me forever to get this just right and then she goes and ruins it! He wasn't really angry, just annoyed at what was going on. After all, it could always be sorted in under a minute easily, it was just Rocky's failing part of his personality...he was extremely proud. \"Ginge!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"You've messed it up!\" Ginger was used to his outbursts and didn't take this seriously as she did when he first began his tantrums. Instead, she gave him a glare that read; 'Serves you right' and tried to hide the creeping smile that was slowly appearing on her face. \"I see no difference, Rocky. Really,\" she encouraged, wishing and longing to bring his wings back down to his sides, for his fidgeting was really beginning to irritate her the slightest. \"You still look handsome.\" \"I'm serious, Ginge!\" he argued defensively. \"I know what ya said about the hat thing...but this is getting too far!\" He lowered his wings finally, though his comb was still vaguely out of place. He gave her a playful glare. \"I can't even see what's wrong with it,\" he drawled deeply, catching Ginger's eye inspecting it closely. \"Nothing! It looks fine!\" \"Says you,\" he backfired, once more raising his wings to the top of his head, pulling and trying to straighten each comb strand individually, praying with crossed feathers that his new solution of neatening was improving. Ginger watched him closely, smiling. Rocky thought that he was making the situation better, well in fact, now it looked positively ten times worse, though Ginger didn't want to disappoint him by offering her own opinion. \"Well?\" he asked hopefully, lowering his wings and showing her the result. Ginger tried to hold back a smirk. \"It...it looks fine,\" she repeated barely. Rocky brought his wings down into his lap, giving his sniggering girlfriend a meaningful glare. \"I know ya lying, aren't ya? I knew that ya would - right.\" The rooster halted his sentence abruptly by rapidly turning his head from Ginger and rising from the floor, so he straightened up tall. This shocked Ginger a little at his actions. \"Where are you going?\" she asked worriedly. Rocky tugged frantically at his tousled comb, now beginning to stick up in places that he would never have stepped outside in if it was up to him...besides the fact that the young rooster would always make sure that he appeared suitable and decent outside of the bunk was beyond the question and beside the point. \"To find a mirror,\" he replied with a half-smarmy grin. \"I wanna inspect the damage and sort it out. Won't be a sec.\" Ginger giggled again in a soft melody as she watched Rocky slowly make his way back to their hut, still trying to recover his pride by arranging his comb in the stylish way that he liked and held it in that order. She saw him muttering curses under his breath as one separate strand kept flailing down inconveniently in his dark eyes. Finally, the speck that was Rocky vanished from her view as he stepped into the hut, and she saw a light appear, as he must have turned the lantern on that they kept. She sighed slowly and shook her head in humour. I wish I had never messed it up; he made such a fuss about it. He can act a little childish when worst comes to...well, worst. If that's what he thought was worst. In telling truth, Ginger wanted a little peace for a moment, to clear her thoughts. These were the only things in which she discussed her private feelings, happenings and emotions. Ginger returned her gaze to the water's edge where she insisted on staring upon the brightness of the moon and the twinkling stars. For the first time she wondered what time it was...surely it was past midnight. She thought about her and Rocky sitting out until daybreak, when the sun would rise over those green, lush, beautiful hills of hers. Maybe they could watch it...a sunrise...that would be nice. No, marvellous. Ginger thought day dreamingly. She let out a satisfied sigh and leant backward on the grass, small strands of it tickling her feathers. She was in paradise...and she knew it. Ginger recalled how the farm had seemed almost like torture...pain...fear...a prison. She and her friends were always treated not respectfully, every day, cowering in tight groups, wondering if their very lives would be destroyed. And they almost were... Ginger's voice in her head rang out, giving her a tiny shiver. Pushing the thoughts away, she let her fright and worry float away on the breeze, so that she felt free again. She should relax now...not think about the farm and it's terrifying moments, they were in the past. And the past should be placed behind you. Ginger told herself properly. All that there is for me to do now...is to look towards the future, and be prepared for it too. A nearby splash suddenly sounded abruptly, casting Ginger out of her peaceful thoughts and opening her bright green eyes in shock. She spun her head in the direction of the sound, which came from the right to where she was sitting, further down the lake and behind the hill. Moments later after silence, the splash was followed by a low thump and a deep groan. Ginger's heart thumped in her throat as she listened intensively. \"H-Hello?\" she whispered out nervously, her senses felt completely numbed. \"Is anyone there?\" No answer responded. Oh, gosh... she panicked in her thoughts, her head racing with confusing ideas, Someone's out there...I can feel it. Oh, Rocky - where are you? Why are you taking so long? Ginger shivered, feeling cold and afraid all over. Her nerves gave a second, sudden jolt as her eyes wandered onto a new lone shadow, making its way steadily up the bank, upon the lush, night time green bank. It appeared unrecognisable, she couldn't make out what it was. Though in the position where she sat, Ginger didn't move. She just couldn't. Oh, no… she moaned finally in her thoughts as the silhouette reached the up most of the edge's shore, and was already halfway up the hill. Whatever it was...didn't seem to be injured, Ginger could tell that from a distance. It wasn't hurt, and it looked altogether strong. It came ever closer, unaware of another presence. Oh, Rocky... Ginger prayed in her thoughts, despite that her heart was already considering the bravest options for her to choose, Come back...come back...where are you? Please, come back... To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: Ooh, whatever could it be? I'm currently writing the third chapter, so it could take longer than this one did to post up. It would be so nice if I got to thank lots more readers at the beginning of the next chapter, though it's really up to you whether you want to read this or not...I'm no judge, lol. The plot is beginning to thicken as you've noticed. Thanks everyone!)[Chapter 3] Azul (A/N: Finally, the third chapter! I'm sorry about the long wait (I think it was April when I last updated…my word.) and from rumours I've heard the CR section is beginning to fade. I hope this makes up for it, and will entertain the waiting crowd!) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: Ginger froze, continuing to stare into the night. She had never felt so frightened in a long time, not since she had been at the farm and had dreaded the thought of death and the lives of her friends. Maybe it had been nothing, and she was just getting flustered for no purpose? Struggling with her unmoving thoughts, she thought back to the time when she had felt afraid, and her heart had last frozen like this. Mr. Tweedy had discovered them all, working away with his tools on their flying machine. What had she done then? Stood her ground? Shivered in a corner? Gave herself up? No. She had fought. She had commanded revenge, and it had worked. Ever since she had stood up to the blustering farmer she had felt a sense of victory last night, and not just because of their success, not because she had left the Tweedys far behind in a pool of gravy, but because she had conquered her fears and left her feeling proud of herself, of everyone for trying. Though her mind was screaming at her, Ginger found herself rising quickly from the grass and forcing courage within. Gathering what frown she could manage, she rushed quickly over to the water's edge and found herself shouting in her own voice, a voice harsh and brave. \"Hey, stop! Who's there?\" She heard the sounds freeze in place before she turned and confronted the shadow, now backing off from her in the dark but heading away from the water. Ginger marched after the stranger, fire in her eyes, and caught up behind, easily surprising the intruder as they had not expected her to follow. She reached out a wing and took firm hold of the other, noticing when she had first seen it that it was at her height, only a little taller. It was a chicken, then. There was no mistaking that. She pulled roughly to bring the stranger backwards, and to halt their movement. A cry of astonishment came from the new chicken, as this was also startling. \"What? What?\" the voice demanded quickly, and rather out of fear. \"Let go of me!\" \"No! Not until you tell me who you are!\" the young hen snapped back, her determined voice sounding hard and clear against the night. She felt shocked at her words but persisted not to care. \"Who are you? Where did you come from?\" \"I – I'll tell you if you let me go,\" the voice said, quietly stammering. It was a strange voice, Ginger had never heard of it before, it was not a foreign accent…she was aware of it, it sounded English. It was higher than she was expecting, though at times it fell into deep tones. Now that they were in way of the moonlight, she was starting to see his appearance a little. Yes, his appearance. It was a rooster. Ginger, though not entirely satisfied, studied the statement carefully. Her green eyes always twinkled when she thought over something, and they did so now. \"You won't run away?\" she asked, her suspicion creeping in. He could take off the minute she let go. She hoped it wasn't another thief on his way, or something like that. Rocky had told her about them. \"No! No,\" the rooster begged blandly. \"I won't.\" \"Promise?\" \"I promise you, I won't.\" Sighing slowly, Ginger released her hold on the rooster's wing, noticing how he stood his ground on steady feet and turned to face her. She felt pleased with how she had handled the situation, he didn't seem dangerous or ready to fight back, and was ready to listen. He hadn't spoken until the promise and made no chance to run. Well, no wonder he had appeared as a shadow – his feathers were black! They were the colour of a raven's, and stuck out strikingly in the light. The top part of his ruffle was a lighter brown colour, which protruded from his head down to his neck and consisted of neat feather arrangements, which stuck out from all sides. He wore a faded violet bandanna around his neck (the knot facing the front), and his plumage tail was of a green-teal shade. Feeling a little calmer, Ginger let her temper settle and looked on at the stranger with an apologetic look in her eyes. It wasn't usual for the island to have visitors, so often she would snap whenever something unordinary happened. She hoped she hadn't offended him. \"I told you I wouldn't run,\" he said with a humble smile. The hen laughed, almost instantly. \"I'm sorry,\" she giggled meekly. \"I didn't know what to expect, I thought you were sneaking up from behind me.\" The rooster smiled, a very polite and sophisticated smile, to note. \"That's perfectly fine, m'am. I wasn't intending to receive the warmest welcome at once,\" he told her. \"I tell you I was shocked though, when you pulled me back like that. I was beginning to think I was under arrest.\" \"I'm…really sorry…\" Ginger trailed off, feeling silly, and casting her eyes to the ground. \"It's not often we have others come here, you know…it's sort of a sanctuary to us. We were hoping for the chance of new arrivals to come by it soon, but maybe we waited too long before we were ready for that hope.\" He laughed, \"I see what you mean.\" She smiled, and cleared her throat. \"Maybe you were surprised as much as I was,\" she began kindly, straightening out her hat, which was beginning to slip. \"I never really explained who I was, did I? I could have been anyone who slipped out of the dark.\" \"You could,\" he agreed, laughing a little at his weak jokes. \"I apologise,\" she said again, wanting to make up for her actions as much as she possibly could. \"It was my first thought. What would you have done if I hadn't come to see who you were? Where would you have gone?\" He raised his blue eyes upwards, as if searching for an answer. Finally, a small, confused smile played upon his face, his beak shifting into an amusing grin. \"Frankly, I wouldn't be sure,\" he admitted honestly, his light red comb hung back behind his head. It didn't stick up like Rocky's always did. \"Maybe I would have asked for help on one of these huts. Did you build them yourself?\" He gestured towards them as if in marvel. \"Well, Mac designed them, and…\" the hen stopped as she noticed the puzzled look on the stranger's face. He obviously had no idea what she was talking about. She shook her head, remembering he was new. \"I'll tell you more later. Yes, they were built,\" she said. The newcomer approved them with a nod of his head as he inspected the lot. \"Very good craftsman work,\" he praised in his classy voice. \"I find it a hobby of mine to construct objects like this…possibly like your friend 'Mac'.\" His eyes shifted as he looked back once again to the water's edge, his smile fading a little as he spotted another shadow on the hillside. \"I can't say the same for my raft,\" he muttered gloomily. \"It must have dashed against the bank or something, many of the logs have come loose from the rope. It wasn't very well done together though, I might add. It was a quick job, really. More of a test run, if you will.\" He let out a low sigh and shook his head a little, his eyes turning away from the bank. \"Oh, you came on a raft?\" Ginger asked curiously, only just realising that she hadn't even bothered to ask how the stranger had come to find this place. It was surrounded by water, after all…maybe the shock just send her into questions at first, it had never occurred to her at all. \"It's not too badly damaged?\" \"Possibly not,\" the rooster sighed out. \"I'll be able to fix it. It was just happening to fall apart within feet of this island…I had to stop somewhere or there might have been the chance that it had run aground.\" He suddenly laughed, as if only just hearing what he had said. \"I suppose I'm the same, now,\" he joked. Ginger smiled again, feeling sorry for his predicament more and more with every sentence he spoke. \"I can't really offer anything,\" she began slowly, \"Then to ask you to stay for a while until you're ready to return on your way?\" she quickly stopped, feeling a little flushed at her dismiss. \"I mean,\" she corrected, \"Unless you plan to stay, or something.\" \"Thank you, m'am,\" the rooster replied, his eyes gleaming. \"I do intend to stay for a while, until my raft is mended for repair. It's quite kind of you. I cannot thank you enough.\" \"You're welcome here,\" Ginger said kind-heartedly. \"I'm sure we have a hut nearby that we can spare for you. It's the least I can do for my behaviour earlier, and I'm sure I'll tell the others in the morning of you.\" She darted a glance upwards at the full moon. \"Now may not be the best of times to wake them,\" she smiled. He only chuckled a little, his laugh high and ringing. \"I'll have to make a proper introduction for you tomorrow, then,\" said Ginger, getting down to the facts and settling things in an orderly manner of hers that she often went through. \"It would be best if I got everyone together and arranged some time for you with them, just to keep things calm and everything – oh! The time that we normally all wake is when Fowl – when the rooster crows in the morning. You'll be able to hear it, all right,\" she added. The rooster grinned, nodding his head. \"I'll make a note of it.\" \"Good,\" Ginger began, turning back again to the waterside. \"I really am sorry about your raft. Should we move it clear for the night or…shall the next day be better for you?\" \"Leave it,\" he answered, waving it away and smiling. \"It'll be fine for now, I'll get working on it tomorrow. It's not my first time repairing it, I'll have to say…it's not the best mode of transport but at least it gets you somewhere.\" The hen nodded in agreement. \"Which hut would you prefer to sleep in?\" \"Well…which do you recommend?\" \"Um…\" Ginger trailed off, searching around her. Finally, her glance landed on one in the far corner from her own, not such as a great distance from Fowler's, and then Mac's own a few feet away. It was empty for the time being, Mac had designed it for a spare just in case the plan arrangement went haywire, but it turned out to be an extra in it's own cost. Her eyes brightened. \"That one, I should think,\" she pointed out. \"It's large and empty and it's suitable at least.\" She turned to face him, a smile upon her face. \"Take this as a further apology for my bombardment,\" she giggled. \"It will be good to have someone new on the island.\" The rooster smiled again, delighted with the offer. \"Very well, I'll take it.\" Ginger beamed comfortingly, the escapades of the night remembered inside of her mind. It was only when she had thought a few pregnant moments had passed, when she had forgotten something important…probably one of the most important things she had to say. Cursing herself silently, she finally spoke up. \"You'll meet the others tomorrow, I hope. Just to know I'm a friend, my name is Ginger,\" she smiled at her response and hoped it didn't sound too rushed. \"What might yours be?\" It took a while for the rooster to reply, possibly a few seconds or so, but in the end, he at last replied, his black feathers highlighted against the moonlight and his blue eyes sparkling. \"Azul,\" he said quietly, his voice dropping down to a friendlier level. \"My name is Azul.\" To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: Well, the third chapter is finally done! Are you pleased with me? I hope this awaits those who were so patient for it, and sorry it took so long. Life shall be returned to the CR section!)[Chapter 4] New Name (A/N: Wow, this story was missed, lol. I got so many reviewers for the third chapter, thank you! It encouraged me to write a fourth, so I have. I'm pleased that there are some people who have been with this dragging story since it was posted; I especially have you to thank.) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: \"Hey, hey…what're you…?\" Rocky was disturbed the following morning by sunlit rays hitting him sharply in the face, narrowing his eyes as he attempted to shield himself. He rubbed his face sleepily with his wings, his hair tousled from sleep. Ginger had been pacing back and forth for quite a while now, waiting for her boyfriend to wake up. In impatience, somewhere halfway through her walk, she had thrown the door open in a last try…of course bringing in the morning to rouse him. It had in fact, worked like a charm but Ginger still never stopped her action. Rocky's dark eyes revealed confusion as he stared at her. \"Ginge…\" he groaned, his eyes shutting slowly as he stretched back out onto the bed, his deep voice dragging. \"Ginge…what's the time? How long have you been marching like that?\" Now she shook her head at him, watching him snuggle back into the confounds of his rest. \"Rocky, I've been waiting ages for you to get up…don't even think about drifting off again.\" She forced back a laugh as he ignored her still, yawning widely but trying to pretend that he was already asleep. \"Eh…why didn't ya just wake me properly?\" he asked groggily. \"I would have done, but it probably wouldn't do much good,\" she almost snapped back, her green eyes wide with edginess. She forced herself to walk over to the bed with the little humour she had and tried to shake him. \"Come on.\" \"No, Baby Doll… please…\" Ginger rolled her eyes. \"I thought I told you not to call me that, anymore.\" \"Yeah, but I can't be bothered to listen…ya know that…\" Huffing in bother, Ginger straightened up, showing that she meant what she said. \"Yes, of course I know. Can you please wake up now?\" Rocky blinked sleepily. \"What?\" \"I said…\" Ginger began slowly, teetering on the edge of losing her temper, \"Are you going to get up now, Rocky? There's something I have to say.\" Shifting about clumsily, Rocky thought over this for a few moments. Often he did this, annoying her to the most level that she could take. He knew it wasn't a good idea to get her angry so soon in the morning, but he could tell she was urgent about something and he wanted it to wait as much as possible. \"Hmm… nah…\" he droned. \"Fine!\" Ginger joked back, trotting off to the corner of the hut, where a container of water lay on a stand by the wall. Rocky heard her moving towards it and managed to lift up his head enough to watch her, suspicion in his voice. \"Where ya going?\" Ginger smiled him a sly smile as she made to pick up the container in her grasp, almost a smile to convince him that what he was about to get would not be as pleasant as he was wishing it to be. This had happened before, and Ginger knew that Rocky could sense it. \"There's always this way,\" she laughed. \"It's cold and wet…\" \"Um…nah – I'll get up,\" Rocky stumbled quickly, sitting up so fast and dodging away to the side of the wall, away from the water. \"Just don't get me with the water, huh? Put…it…down…\" he joked, motioning slowly as if it would go off at any moment. There was a slight smile tugging away at his face. The container was released and placed back on the stand. Ginger didn't really see any point now that he was up, it wouldn't be as much fun. Sighing, she turned to him and smiled. \"Did you hear me before?\" she asked, challenging him. \"Er…yeah, you said ya had something to say.\" \"Oh, so you do listen. Well, yes. I have something to tell you, Rocky, and hopefully the rest of the others before the day is through,\" Ginger said. Rocky frowned, looking surprised. \"What is it?\" Now Ginger shifted about on the spot, rubbing a dirt mark into the floor with her foot. \"Well…do you remember last night? When we were sitting out together?\" Grinning, Rocky nodded slowly. \"Yeah…\" \"Oh, Rocky – pay attention! Can you remember what happened afterwards? You had to back inside to sort yourself out…I think you must have gone to sleep then, because you were like that when I came back. Anyway, while you were gone…something happened.\" Now Rocky seemed shocked, thinking of all the options it could be. Something dangerous perhaps…had something terrible happened to her while he had been sleeping away like a blooming baby? He couldn't remember her crying out, otherwise he might have heard her. \"Like what?\" he asked slowly. \"Well,\" Ginger began again, \"I heard this noise down by the riverbank…and when I went to go and investigate, there was someone there. Heaven knows…it was one of us! Well, not one of us, but a rooster! He'd travelled here over a while, on a raft, Rocky! Can you believe it?\" Finding all of this hard to take in, Rocky stared at her for a moment. Then he snapped back, blinking quickly. \"Whoa, back up!\" he said, turning his feathers in that particular action. \"Let's rewind here. Are you trying to tell me that another rooster came to the island last night?\" His voice went rather high as he finished. \"Well…yes.\" Rocky stared at her, dumbfounded. There were a few moments of silence before he spoke up, addressing her. \"I never expected you to say 'yes',\" he said, a small frown playing across his face, shadowing his eyes. \"Oh, what did you want me to say?\" Ginger argued back. \" 'No' would be great! That would have made my day, Doll-face!\" \"Why on Earth were you wanting me to say that?\" Ginger questioned. \"Well, I - \" here Rocky cut off, rubbing the back of his neck with his wing and staring her right in the eye, not wanting to answer but finding no way out of it. At first he wasn't sure if she was making it up…it sounded as if she wasn't, though. \"I-I thought you were joking,\" he finished clumsily. \"As you've probably figured out already, I'm not,\" Ginger retorted, finishing. She stared up at Rocky, feeling a little perplexed herself. Why was he taking this so hard? Usually he didn't mind if something new happened. Now Rocky sighed indignantly, patrolling across the room himself and looking as if he were going to throw himself about in rage. \"What's he want here?\" he demanded, his voice quite shrill. \"What's he come here for?\" he rounded on Ginger, who had her wings crossed over her chest and was staring at him still. \"Did he tell ya?\" Rocky asked. \"No, not really. He came here by accident, he said. He needs to find somewhere to stay until his raft is mended. I said I wouldn't mind if he rested here for a while…you don't mind, do you, Rocky?\" Ginger looked up at him, her eyes searching him for responses. Rocky huffed. \"Course I don't mind, Ginge. Whatever gave ya that idea?\" \"I can't imagine,\" sighed Ginger, rolling her eyes. Stepping over to her, Rocky brushed back his comb and let it flop back into place as he considered what to do. He glanced at her thoughtfully, his beak pursed. \"Did he give you a name?\" he questioned slowly. Ginger nodded, feeling relieved at a simple request. \"Yes, he did. Azul, I think it was. He's British, Rocky…don't laugh!\" For at that moment, a small smirk had begun to cross the rooster's face, trying to hold back some sort of chortle. Ginger knew that even asking for a name was not what he was really after. Scoffing, Rocky chuckled. \"What kind of a name is that?\" \"I'm not sure, I've never heard of it before.\" \"No surprise there,\" Rocky argued cheekily, grinning. Ginger frowned at him a little. He really wasn't taking this news well, not as well as she had hoped him to. What difference did it make about a name? He didn't normally poke fun at the names of some of the other chickens on the island, and even if he did he kept his comments to himself. Why should this one be any different? \"Gee, what were his parents thinking?\" Rocky muttered to himself. Trying to hold in the tolerance she had left inside of her, Ginger tried to keep her temper down as she struggled to hold her cool. \"Rocky, just forget about the name, all right? He stayed here overnight; he was really shaken up…\" she trailed off, watching the expression on his face gradually change. \"I-I thought you wanted to meet him,\" she finished quietly. Now Rocky stared at her. He really didn't want to meet this newcomer, but it really seemed important to Ginger. Not that Rocky was uncomfortable talking and introducing himself to strangers, of course…but for some reason, something was holding him back from seeing him. He couldn't understand what. \"Well…\" he dragged, shifting about again, \"Yeah, I guess…I suppose… if ya really wanted me to, I would. Ya know I would, Ginge.\" \"So what is it?\" she wanted to know. \"Oh, I dunno,\" Rocky stuttered. \"I guess it's just so sudden, y'know? This hasn't happened before.\" He looked at Ginger carefully, trying to show the hidden meaning of his grudge in his eyes. How could he prevent this so quickly? He really didn't want to go out there and see this rooster for himself. Ginger nodded carefully, thinking things over. \"No, it hasn't,\" she admitted, finally pleased that she got a sensible answer. \"But you'll have to get used to changes around here, Rocky. I should know…I've had to deal with them all my life, and I expect somewhere along you've had to as well.\" Rocky darted his eyes away, taking this in. \"Yeah,\" was all he would say. \"So please give him a chance?\" she pleaded. \"He's only here for a while. The least you can do is to be a friend to him. He obviously didn't have many if he was trying to get away from something, maybe that's all he needs right now. Maybe his past was a sad tale.\" \"He's not the only one,\" Rocky answered back, but his reply was inaudible to his girlfriend. She didn't hear his response and Rocky was pleased that she hadn't. \"I have to let the others know he's here,\" she said, beginning to bustle about, organising her time. \"They haven't had the word, yet. I'll have to fetch him out and then get the rest to meet him. The last thing I want is panic and chaos when they see him out and about.\" She stood up on tiptoe and gave Rocky a quick kiss on the cheek. She smiled at him. \"I won't be long.\" It was only a few seconds as she had made to leave the door, when she heard more footsteps approaching behind her. Turning, she saw Rocky following her back, a sort of resolute appearance in his brown eyes. She tried to hold back a laugh. \"Where are you going?\" she wondered, now only inches from leaving the hut but still holding her ground to find out this mystery. Rocky really didn't want her to have any more moments alone with this stranger without him. Maybe he wanted to be friends with him, after all. Of course, the real meaning was blind to Ginger's gaze. She, on the other hand…did not know, or had not even considered the real reason for Rocky's actions. They were something that he kept to himself, or for the time being, anyway. Until he had figured it all out, that is. \"Out,\" he told her, taking her by the wing and smiling at her. \"Come on.\" To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: Well, another chapter's finished! I'm sorry that this chapter was only Rocky and Ginger again, but I promise next chapter will have others! I've planned out this story in full, so I can assure you more chickens will be seen in the next update. Until then, I hope you liked: smile : )[Chapter 5] Introducing Britannia (A/N: I am so sorry about my delays! I've been extra busy trying to work out the genuine plot of this story; I've got it all under way now so I'm back on track to writing. Um…do you think you guys can take 24 chapters: smile : I know it's a lot but there are plenty of surprises. It shouldn't take me too long now to write it up. I'm quite proud of the ending, I hope you'll like it shall I ever reach there. I've also had help with the Scottish accent, as one of my friends has so kindly translated it for me! Thank you for everyone who reviewed chapter 4!) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: The sunlight was stripped and warm on their feathers as Rocky and Ginger stepped out into the open. Rocky raised his wing to his eyes to shield himself, and searched the island slowly, an expression of surprise and disbelief falling across his face. Ginger followed his stare, seeming confused. \"Hey, err…can we say 'dead'?\" he muttered under his breath, his dark eyes watching the surroundings. There seemed to be no one in sight, hardly much commotion was going on, and it was very eerie for both of them to step into a world of silence. Ginger frowned. \"Where is everyone?\" \"I dunno,\" Rocky shrugged, lowering his wing back down to his side and giving Ginger a doubtful look. \"Maybe nobody's up yet?\" The hen shook her head. \"No, it's not that early. Besides, I could have sworn that I heard a good crowd up and about this morning…before you woke.\" \"Hey, you woke me,\" Rocky reminded her, with a smirk. \"Whatever, it doesn't matter. We still need to figure out what's going on,\" Ginger fretted, looking around another time curiously. Everything seemed to be well in place, nothing appeared to be different. Ginger was just beginning to think that something terrible had happened when a noise came up from in front, over the hill. Her eyes widened. \"What was that?\" \"What? What was what – you heard a noise?\" Ginger nodded slowly, listening carefully and squinting into the sunrise. \"It came from up there,\" she pointed. \"I think I heard something – someone. I think it was laughing, maybe it was Fowler.\" \"May be,\" Rocky mocked jokingly, crossing his eyes. Trying not to laugh, Ginger tugged a little at his wing. \"Stop that, come on,\" she told him half-seriously, pulling him further onto the island. Rocky didn't struggle, for he was as puzzled as his girlfriend was at the moment, instead he just followed at a slow pace. As they grew closer to the hill, the sound became louder. Rocky and Ginger clambered quickly up the steep mound and peeked over the top, unsure and curious of what they would see. What lay before their eyes was indeed surprising, and caused both of them to gasp out loud. \"Holy, moly,\" Rocky whistled, his deep voice low with amazement. Below them, in the nearby field quarters stood a circle of chickens, gathered tightly around one individual and talking away to themselves excitedly. The one chicken that stood in the centre was rather tall, with a figurative posture, a soft but clear voice that could be heard from afar, and even more importantly, distinctively raven black feathers… \"That's him!\" Ginger suddenly blurted out, so quickly that Rocky jumped from the interruption. \"That's the rooster that came here last night! The one in the middle, the dark-feathered one, can you see him?\" she asked, directing her question to Rocky, who now had a strange look on his face. After a moment of silence, he finally snapped out of it. \"That's the new guy?\" \"Yes, of course.\" Rocky coughed a little in his throat, hoping it didn't sound too obvious. \"What's the deal with the fan club?\" he wanted to know, trying not to make his voice as slippery as it sounded. \"He sure got popular, huh?\" Ginger noticed the tone in his voice and smiled smugly at him. \"If I'm not mistaken, you weren't exactly wanting isolation when you arrived, Mr Big-Shot,\" she said in correction, watching his expression fall away. \"You sucked it all up, am I right?\" she gave him a look, which brought him a meek grin. \"Hehe, ya got me there,\" he recovered quickly, straightening himself up. \"But what can I say? Everyone wants to be noticed.\" He shot another look down at the rooster again, almost looking as if he wanted to turn back and have nothing to do with him, as if he didn't want to know anything about him whatsoever. \"What'd ya say his name was…again?\" Ginger sighed, hoping that this wouldn't lead up to more jokes. \"Azul,\" she said. \"And no, I don't know where it came from. Maybe if we went down and asked, he might just explain.\" She gave Rocky a hopeful gaze. Rocky waited, staring up at the sky with his wings clasped. \"Here's an idea!\" he proclaimed, pointing at her all of a sudden. \"You go down and ask, Ginge, I'll just wait up here, and – whoa!\" His words were stolen as Ginger quickly grabbed hold of him again and began to pull him down the hill, not even looking at him. \"Hey!\" he cried out again, trying not to stumble. \"I don't know why you're so unsure on meeting him,\" Ginger began patiently, her approach gaining on the circle before her. \"But you're at least going to say something, aren't you?\" There was no response. Apparently he had given up the argument, or at long last he had run out of comments to say. He hung behind her, a small tight force of resent holding against his heart. Why was he holding himself back? \"Excuse me!\" Ginger called out politely, stepping up to the group and directing her voice. The other chickens, at the sight of her, stepped aside to let her through, wondering why their leader hadn't been up to check on this earlier. Rocky stayed back still, making uncomfortable expressions. The noise and commotion was so loud that Ginger could hardly hear herself. Everyone seemed to be talking so excitedly and quickly that it was impossible to get a word in. For a moment, she felt like shouting to raise her voice, but she knew that even that would be a challenge. In relief, she spotted her friend Mac nearby. \"Mac!\" she almost called out in reply, pushing a random hen out of the way to make a clear path, she had left Rocky behind in the chaos and didn't know if she dared to go back. She shot a glance behind her, but he was nowhere in sight, and Mac still hadn't heard her. Ginger had to force her way up to her and tap her on the shoulder. Mac quickly looked around at the contact and saw her friend standing there, looking annoyed but confused. \"Mac, thank goodness,\" Ginger panted, clearly not pleased with the way everyone stood out. She frowned as she glanced around at the huddle of hens, now in a tight pact gathered near Azul. \"Guid day hen! Ur ye aw reit?\" Mac asked her, scribbling away at her notes as usual. Mac's appearance differed from Ginger's, with her mop comb and bucked teeth, and the magnified glasses that she always wore. The Scottish hen was Ginger's life long friend, and had been so for many years. She could always tell whenever something was wrong, like now when she saw her expression before her. \"Fine,\" Ginger sounded tonelessly, glancing around at the large circle before her. \"Good grief.\" Mac nodded, though not looking up. \"Oohhh aye, quite a crowd, isnae it?\" Ginger just stared, fascinated for a moment. Then finally, she found her voice. \"I-I didn't expect so many others would be here just to meet him,\" she commented, noticing that Mac looked up at her over her notes, surprised to hear this. \"I mean…he only came last night…I wasn't intending this much attention!\" Now it was Mac's turn to stare. She put on a confused sort of face and watched her friend, and every now and then she kept darting her gaze back and forth, trying to get a glimpse of the new rooster herself. She at last turned her view to Ginger, and scratched the side of her head with her pencil. \"Och, aam sorry,\" she began, her voice directed loud. \"Ah didne hear 'at ye awreddy kent heem.\" She shot a glance towards Azul, watching as he grinned at a bunch of hens, obviously talking so fast that he couldn't even hear them. \"I do know him, Mac,\" Ginger explained, her eyes fixed on him now. \"I met him alone…he'd run aground and I told him that he could stay. He seemed pretty unsure about staying here then…but now he looks as if he wants a game of twenty questions.\" She put her wings on her hips and frowned a little. Mac sighed, looking about herself. \"It certainly looks as if he's settled in noo,\" she said, her hazel eyes lighting up and beginning to search the crowds. \"Um, whit aboot Mr. Rhodes? Has he mit heem yit?\" Ginger just shook her head slowly. Rocky definitely looked as if he didn't want to meet this stranger, and no doubt he had probably turned tail and rushed back to the hut, not wanting to stand about. He never had been someone patient, in Ginger's view. She let out a sigh of indignation and rolled her green eyes. \"I'll go and talk to him,\" she said, making her way through. There were a few bumps and pushes and various cries, but Ginger finally managed to break through and reach the centre, marching up to Azul, not meaning to seem angry in her strides so she tried to cover it up with curiosity, and approached him. Azul pardoned the next few questions that others were tugging for answers, and eventually caught Ginger's eye. He offered a grin at her and waved a little, explaining to the other hens that he needed to talk to someone. He squeezed his way past and walked up to her, his blue eyes full of excitement. \"Morning, Miss Ginger,\" he smiled, brushing himself down. Ginger blinked, not as angry as she expected herself to be. Pointing around at the vast large circle, she faced him on. \"What's all this?\" Azul chuckled. \"Would you believe it? I take one foot outside this morning and I feel as if I'm ready to be attacked! Hundreds of these chickens come rushing straight at me, but not like your entry last night, I might add.\" It was at this point that Ginger managed a weak smile herself. \"They're all asking me these questions, I feel as if I'm someone important! You've got a lot of decent friends here, Miss Ginger…how do you keep up with all of the names, and everything?\" He pretended to stagger as if he were carrying a heavy load, before continuing. \"Sorry to be such a bother, and all…\" Ginger didn't know what to think. She felt confused, but yet relieved that Azul wasn't angry or upset at all of this new awareness. She made out another small smile, but only from her thoughts. Gesturing towards the others, she offered a small acceptance, her face upwards in a friendly intake. \"Maybe there is a way to know everyone better,\" she said. \"Tonight I'll arrange everyone together outside, if you like. You can share your story with us, then…and maybe things will be simpler.\" She was pleased at the approval expression on the rooster's face. He twiddled his feathers a little and looked happy for the invitation, finally beaming brightly at her. \"Thank you kindly,\" he told her. \"I'll be looking forward to it.\" He finished his task of brushing himself down again, straightening out his ebony black feathers. \"Great,\" Ginger proclaimed, her voice softer now. \"I'll arrange it all, don't worry. You'll hopefully meet everyone here and…you know, not feel like such a stranger among us anymore. We don't want you to feel uncomfortable.\" \"Well, I appreciate it,\" Azul said gratefully, grinning again. \"I do.\" Though she had been a little surprised at the commotion of the morning, Ginger couldn't help thinking that it wasn't Azul's fault. Somehow, he managed to not get onto her bad side much; she found that she could hardly be angry with him for anything. Unlike Rocky when he first… Rocky! she suddenly remembered. Azul was just taking off again to meet the rest of the crowd, when something snapped inside Ginger's head. \"Oh, wait,\" she said aloud, quickly following him, watching as he turned to look at her, a little puzzled. \"There's someone you haven't met just yet. Rocky…he's one of the other roosters.\" There was a passive silence, broken by a squeal of protest from a nearby hen. \"Oh,\" Azul nodded. \"I see.\" \"Well,\" Ginger continued, \"Maybe tonight you can be acquainted…he's pretty unsure about all of this – he doesn't suit to change, you see…and he was sort of taken aback by all of this news. It would be great if you got to know him.\" He smiled at her, but it was a bit of a clumsy smile…a little too uncomfortable for Ginger's liking. Why were these roosters so cautious around each other? Was it something to do with pride, or dignity? Ginger could never figure it out, but she didn't really want to wait around and guess. \"Of course,\" he replied quietly. \"Of course…\" Ginger beamed back at him, not noticing the tension in his voice at all. \"He also wanted me to ask you something,\" she said. \"Oh? What's that?\" Here she paused, hoping that her question wasn't going to sound too impolite. It had sounded fine before…now it just seemed rushed and inappropriate. She swallowed anyway, and put on a gaze that she trusted was friendly. \"Um…he wonders where your name came from,\" she answered. \"Whether it was from ancestors or just simply a favourite in your family name, he was saying so earlier.\" Though it had been ruder when Rocky had mentioned the question, Ginger wasn't going to argue against that. All that Azul offered was a sly grin, before turning away from her and stepping back into the crowd. \"I suppose you'll find out tonight at the meeting,\" he muttered to her quietly. \"I'm sure then you'll hear everything. You and this 'Rocky'.\" With that, he disappeared and was swept away again by another horde of rampaging chickens. Strangely, his voice had sounded rather hurt. Ginger just stared at the spot where he stood, wondering what his words meant. Why couldn't he have told her then? Was there something deeper behind his character, a story to tell? The hen didn't really have a response to what she would have said if he really had told her, maybe he wanted everyone to hear at the same time. Even so, why hide it from her so mysteriously? \"Odd.\" Ginger whispered to herself, before turning back and making her way through the circle again, thinking things over carefully, and being rather glad in her heart that it hadn't been Rocky and Azul's first meeting by the yard. To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: I'm so sorry about the lack of updates I've been having. I have a whole bunch of new stories I've been posting and I've been trying to go back to this one in my spare time. I hope you like this chapter and expect a chapter 6 to be on its way soon! I can promise you you'll learn further into Azul's past. It's interesting, I can guarantee. Please R&R;!)[Chapter 6] Questions (A/N: O.K, another update! This chapter was brought on quickly as I realised that I can't really wait around to do a chapter every month…we'll be here almost two years! So I decided to speed things up a little. I hope this pleases some…) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: The whole mystery was indeed forgotten by the time that the night began to settle in. Ginger had been as good as her word, organising everyone and sending the message around that there would be a meeting at the next hour. It wasn't a secret, however…everyone knew that it would be involving Azul and his arrival. A lot of the girls were rather excited. It wasn't often that a newcomer came along to visit…Azul had been the first one since they had made the sanctuary their home. Many gossiping had been going on while the meeting time had drawn closer, whether this dashing rooster had a female friend…if he was looking, even. \"Oh, pull yourself togetha!\" Bunty had scolded harshly, as a few giggling hens had told her of their concerns. She couldn't see what the fuss was all about either, though she was interested in the stories and wanted to know herself. On an account, she hardly found Azul 'striking', not like the others. As the hour closed in for the meeting time, Ginger looked out of her hut window and already saw a crowd beginning to gather in the field. She gave a small smile to herself as she watched, and called out to Rocky who was getting ready himself, but she never turned around. \"Everyone's coming together,\" she said. \"We'd better get out there quickly.\" \"What's the hurry?\" Rocky dawdled, straightening out his spotted neck scarf and trying not to look out into the field. \"We can be just a little late, can't we?\" \"No, we can't.\" \"Yeah, sure we can! The spokesperson's always late, Ginge,\" Rocky's voice sounded a little bitter as he struggled to remain out of sight. He forced a scowl from his face as he saw that Ginger had rolled her eyes, mainly out of annoyance. \"I don't see why I gotta go,\" he sulked. Ginger still didn't look at him, but searched the island for more groups of hens. \"You have to come along, Rocky,\" she told him patiently. \"I'd like you to hear what he has to stay too. What would you prefer? Staying indoors while everyone listens to his story outside?\" \"Works for me,\" he shrugged. \"Oh, Rocky!\" \"What?\" Rocky remarked, pretending to act surprised, and asking with his voice a little higher than usual. \"Why is this so important for you? Why do you wanna get him to know everyone? The guy's gonna leave as quick as he came!\" Ginger still couldn't understand the strain that had been building up between Rocky and Azul. It was like they were enemies, and they had barely even made eye contact. She sighed, but still refused not to look at him, and carried on staring. Rocky continued to take forever, patrolling around the room as if in a daze, mainly to stall time. He really didn't want to go…why did he have to? Ginger had already explained to him about her talk with Azul, and Rocky wanted no such thing. He didn't feel like talking to this rooster right now, not about anything. Finally, Ginger turned her head around and noticed that Rocky was deliberately taking too long. Fuming a little, she marched away from the window and took him by the wing, ignoring his complaints. \"Come on, you're ready!\" she snapped. \"What if I just stay here, huh?\" \"No,\" Ginger frowned. :--: In the end, the two eventually hauled themselves out onto the island, free of arguments and disagreements, though Rocky's expression did appear quite sour. They made themselves settled in upon the grass along with the rest of the group, already noticing Azul waiting to begin at Ginger's word. Due to Rocky's pace, they were the last ones to show up. Ginger let it pass…this time. Fowler sounded impatient, but yet eager as he said; \"Let's get on with it, what-what?\" Clearing her throat a little, Ginger stood before the others, receiving a small smile from Azul as she began. \"Everyone, I know yesterday was rather a shock, and maybe some surprise to the news that…we have a visitor here with us,\" she said. \"Pah! You can say that again!\" came a cry, but was immediately disturbed harshly by Fowler's deafening voice. He tapped the unknowing chicken on the back of the head with his cane and bellowed terribly. \"QUIET!\" The silence followed, only starting up again when Ginger spoke. \"Ahem, so…now's the chance for you all to meet him properly. I know that many of you may have already been acquainted, but not everyone,\" she continued. \"And I know that he wants to be comfortable in our group, so…I'll hand you over to him now.\" She motioned quickly to Azul, who stood up at once and stepped into Ginger's place, while she retreated back to Rocky's side. His grin was the first thing she noticed. \"Nice speech.\" \"Oh, well…I was actually nervous,\" Ginger stammered, looking back into the crowd at Azul's posture. \"I hate introducing people to others.\" Rocky laughed half-heartedly. \"Ya seemed O.K with me.\" \"If I remember,\" Ginger said again matter-of-factly. \"You did most of the talking yourself. I could only get a few words in edgeways.\" A laugh sprung up when she saw the look on his face. \"I suppose he's not as loud as you, either.\" \"And ya like that, right?\" the rooster countered, tightening his grip around her wing and staring her seriously in the face. Sighing, Ginger turned back to the crowd. \"I suppose so,\" she whispered, keeping her voice barely over a mutter, but not noticing the deserted expression on her boyfriend's face as she turned away from him. \"Yeah,\" Rocky muttered quietly, his eyes downcast. \"Great.\" :--: Azul opened his heart that night. His tale astounded the others, even Rocky had to admit that it was very dramatic. Though through it all, he was still welcome to share questions and answers with what he had experienced, and never showed a sign of hurt upon his face whenever something painful was accidentally brought up. \"How did you come here?\" a hen quietly wondered. \"Now that's an interesting question,\" Azul went on. \"It's been known that I make my way around from place to place by my own creations, what I travelled to your island on was a raft, made in only a few weeks…barely a month.\" His talk about creations caused Mac to suddenly sit up and take notice. \"Yoo're a scientist, ur a builder mebbe?\" she asked quickly. Azul shrugged a little. \"I've been known to tamper a bit with that sort of thing,\" he explained. \"Though I'm not a professional, I can assure you. It sounds as if that reaches you too, and interests you …am I right?\" he smiled again when Mac nodded fervently. Rocky and Ginger stood by the side, Rocky still keeping a small sulk on his face. He fixed his eyes on Ginger whenever she made signs of asking a question herself, and always stopped her when he had the chance. On the fourth time that she tried to get a word in, Rocky forced her attention away. \"Rocky!\" \"Ginge, ya know enough about the guy already!\" Rocky swung back, spinning her away from the view so that she was glaring up at him. \"C'mon! L-let someone else have a turn for once,\" he finished lamely, stuttering, and trying to avoid her smouldering gaze as best he could. Ginger just shook her head slowly at him. \"Please…\" she started. \"I don't know everything about him, I am entitled to question him a bit more. You're sounding like he's part of my family or something…like he's my brother and I know more than everyone else!\" At the mention of the word 'family', Ginger's heart skipped a beat. Her thoughts had wandered a little since Azul had arrived. Now frowning slightly, Rocky attempted a backfire. \"No, not that! It's just…he looks pretty busy right now, look how Agnes is…well, look at her! She's all over him!\" he said diversely, staring himself at the hen as if it were a sight for sore eyes. \"Geez…\" Bothering not to argue, Ginger didn't even want to try and argue. She gave the rooster a warning look and turned back to the group, wondering if there might be the chance for her to talk to Azul later. Until then, she would just listen…if it would do to shut Rocky up about everything she undertook anyway. The next question caught everyone's attention; a young dark hen asked it in her rather timid voice. \"W-why did you come here?\" Everyone hushed to listen what Azul had to say about this. A faraway look was distant in his blue eyes, and it took a few seconds to come back to his senses. He seemed almost sad…with a numb expression but yet with a wistful grin. \"It's quite a story, actually,\" he told them. \"A bit tragic on my half to be exact. I didn't arrive here for exploration or new travels, or whatever else most of you may think that I am. I came here to escape from my own feelings. You see, it was complicated where I lived. A whole love story told with an unhappy ending. A heartache of mine stepped too far over the edge. I wanted a love that I could never have for myself, and I wanted it so badly that I was willing to give it up for anything in the world. Only…that person never returned the favour of what I wanted most.\" Many chickens had now leant forward, suddenly interested. \"Ah, the impediments of love!\" Fowler commented. \"It was hard at first, always wanting her near me. Her refusals used to make me feel all cold inside…as if I were hollow and had nothing left. I just needed her, and nobody else…and then I would have been happy. But I suppose romantic, fawning types were not for her, so she told me to let her go, and go my own way. My heart hurt so much it was actually painful. I didn't want to go…I didn't want to leave her behind. But after two weeks I couldn't stand it any longer. I knew that I couldn't be there…be with her to deal with the pain. It hurt so much I thought I would die. So in that last month alone I built a raft, fixed it up and sailed away without a goodbye given. I didn't want to say goodbye, she didn't even want to see me, and it seemed all right to leave without a word. I don't know if she's still waiting for me, but I doubt it really. She never liked 'blue-eyed boys', as she called them. She told me I looked too innocent, as if I were a child wanting a new friend or a playmate. And she wanted more than that…I could have given it to her if she'd wanted it. But now it's too late. This is my path onwards to a new life, and…I want to start again if I have to.\" He lowered his head, thoughts intruding him. \"Strega…\" he whispered. There was a shocked silence that rang through the others. Everyone pitied him right then, there were no complaints of lies or wild stories, this was completely unexpected. Many of the hens were almost beside themselves with despair. \"How…romantic…\" someone breathed. \"Really touching…\" \"You poor soul…\" \"Oh, c'mon!\" Rocky retorted under his breath, trying to hide the sympathy in his voice. He crossed his wings and turned away, his eyes glued on the huts. His attention sprang up when he heard Azul speak again. \"Rocky!\" he called out, completely startling the other rooster. Rocky had no knowledge that Azul even knew his name, he turned sharply and stared in surprise. Waiting for a response, he knew that he must have looked funny with the expression on his face, but it was an overall disbelief. Azul forced a tight grin, keeping his eyes on him. \"My name,\" he brought up in a low voice. \"It's Spanish. Means 'blue'. Maybe for my eyes, my parents never told me. Does that answer your question?\" his own was more like a challenge. Rocky nodded dumbly, still with his wings crossed. \"Yeah,\" he mumbled out, giving Ginger a noticeable glance. \"Thanks.\" He kept his attention on Azul and the others, until their gazes were all away from him. Then he rounded on Ginger, his eyes full of confusion. \"You told him to say that!\" he accused. \"Why'd ya have to?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"When ya saw him again this morning…why couldn't he have told ya then?\" \"He wanted to explain tonight,\" Ginger said tiresomely. \"And besides, why is it bothering you so much? You found your answer didn't you? You wanted to know what his name meant so I arranged to tell you.\" Rocky frowned to himself. \"It's just really shown me up, that's all.\" \"Oh, well, I'm sorry!\" Ginger argued, fire blazing in her green eyes. \"Sorry for 'showing you up', I must feel terrible! Not everyone bows to you whenever you want, Rocky! You don't need all the attention…all the time! Can't you at least show some respect for others?\" \"I do!\" Rocky retorted, now angry himself. \"I don't always want the attention! I do feel sorry for the guy, I just wish you'd tell me what you talk about!\" \"Why?\" Ginger asked exasperatingly. \"Rocky, this is really beginning to get silly - \" here, her words trailed off, and her expression suddenly sprung through. She tried to hold back a stifled giggle and looked up at him with triumph in her eyes and her voice hitting back with a softer tone. \"I see,\" she almost whispered softly, but with seriousness. \"Jealousy doesn't look good on you, you know.\" Rocky just stared in amazement. \"Jealous?\" he almost spat out the word. \"Me? C'mon, Ginge – that's…that's ridiculous…\" his voice wavered at the end and he suddenly cut off, going quiet. He said no more after that and kept his opinions to himself, watching the group enjoy more of Azul's tall stories. Though their arguments happened more often than some people thought, neither a word could be gotten out of the two that night, and the only sound that remained through the evening was the high, clear ringing of laughter on the wind, that sounded from Azul himself. To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: I made Rocky and Ginger fight. Lol. I can't believe I just did that. Sorry about the lack of updates but Christmas was one busy time of the year for me. I had this written by New Year's but haven't posted it up until now. I'm really sorry, and I promise I'll try not to leave it this long again. Please R&R;!)[Chapter 7] A Story to Tell (A/N: I've decided to focus most of my long writing attention on this story for a while, though I may write a few chapters now and again for other things. So if I take a break from this for a while…you'll know why. Lol. I've decided to put up this next instalment quickly, as it's a chapter I've wanted to write. I hope you like it! This is focused mainly on Azul. There is no Rocky or Ginger in this chapter, so it is something very different for me.) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: It was a cloudless night that evening, as no one made any moves to depart for bed, they were so into what was going on, that they hadn't even bothered to strain their hearing to eavesdrop on Rocky and Ginger, whose argument had flown in and left them now for their own hut, still being surely cold towards the other. The sky darkened gradually as Azul's tale grew into its terrific climax, enchanting and sometimes startling the listening chickens. They now looked up to this rooster as a gentle mind with a healing soul, and knew that his clearest descriptions were from the heart. Never had they heard someone spill out their truest feelings so deeply as he did, he sounded as if he had experienced and spoken to real love. He laughed again now, his voice polite against the wind. \"Of course,\" he was saying, \"That is only the brief section of the story. The rest of it is yet to come. That is, unless…\" he trailed off, staring around at the others with watchful and concerned eyes. Most of his audience were close to tears already. \"It all depends on whether you want me to proceed,\" he finished, not wanting to be the bearer of upsetting the rest of the group. He glanced to his right and for the first time noticed that Rocky and Ginger had disappeared. One hen was sniffling a little. \"No, no!\" she cried out. \"Go on!\" \"Yes, please do!\" another one insisted, wiping her eyes. \"We'd orl like t' hear the end, ducks,\" Bunty added, though she wasn't crying like most others it could be said that the story touched her deeply. For this moment, her emotions hung on her face and she looked seriously into it. Azul shifted a little. \"All right, if you say so. But…I'm a little unsure of where to begin, you see.\" This comment was greeted by many protests. \"Start at the beginning, old chap!\" Fowler proclaimed, raising his cane high into the air above his head for all to see. \"That's usually the best place to start. I haven't heard a good story for years, why, back in my day - \" At this, there was an instant uproar of noise, much moaning and groaning from the hens at Fowler's words, and just anyone making noise to drown out the sound of his rambling. They certainly didn't want to hear one of his old war stories when they could have some new, fresh romance from Azul. It was something they hadn't heard before and the tale interested them. \"Well,\" Azul started, watching the eager expressions on the girl's faces, \"All right. It began a few months ago, on a darkened day it seemed. I was out for a morning stroll, though I didn't mind the weather…it never seemed to bother me. The clouds were high, the hills rolling. Everything seemed normal, ordinary. And then I saw her…\" :--: The young, black-feathered rooster stopped and stared, his position halting as his eyes landed on the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She was sitting in the scrabble of the meadow, picking petals off discarded flowers. Azul couldn't take his eyes off her, even though he had only seen her, he felt as if he had been looking all day. Her feathers were a gentle golden like the sun, and her posture structured. She carried a feel for the surrounding; she gave off a wonderful sensation. The rooster knew that he must have looked like an idiot, standing there, but it was all he could do. His mouth was open, his eyes were wide. He stood there for another five minutes. He was only snapped out of his daze when he heard her voice close to him, and then he realised that she was standing in front. \"Like to stare, don't you?\" she said a little coldly, and frowned a bit. Azul stared down and landed in two chocolate brown eyes. He blinked, listening to the harmony of her voice. \"Oh…I - \" was all he managed to say, before she had already begun to make her way onwards. Azul couldn't move to go after her; he could only watch her leave. And he knew for that moment, that he had fallen for her. He just had to know her name; he spent the rest of the day wondering what it could be. Something beautiful…it had to describe her in every way imaginable. He wondered what he would call her, if he knew her as a friend. What he would name her if she were his own daughter. He thought of everything to do with her that night. He had often heard of love at first sight, but had never known it would happen to him. He could barely breathe; it had hit him so hard and fast. How could something so amazing enter and leave his life so quickly? What if he were to never see her again? The very thought left him with shivers and a sense of fear. That could never happen, he wouldn't let it happen. He spent the next week searching for her, his mind racing after every unsuccessful day. Where was she? The next time he saw her, he could hardly believe his luck. Their paths were ready to cross down a narrow road, and he quickly sped up so that they met in the middle. There was only enough room for one chicken to walk at once. The hen looked him in the eye, and sighed impatiently. \"P-please…\" Azul began, completely lost for words. Now here was his chance and he was blowing it like a fool. He had no idea what to say to her, now she was here, his heart was racing and his throat was dry. He had to say something! Something to impress her, something to make her smile… anything! The hen had a glower in her eyes. \"You again,\" she said in a quiet voice. \"I thought I wouldn't be seeing you after that day in the meadow. I must say I'm rather surprised.\" Her voice held a strong British accent, clear and precise, and very formal. To Azul it was a melody to the ears; he would have given anything right at that moment for her to speak again. Azul could only smile. What a voice she had! He studied the colour of her eyes, hoping to make her laugh so he would be able to hear that too. \"I-I'm quite pleased that we met like this,\" he managed to stammer out. \"Now I can ask you for your name…I never did before and I regretted it at once.\" Scoffing, the hen leant back a little. \"You're very quick on the uptake, aren't you?\" she said. \"Why do you want to know my name?\" \"Because…\" Azul began, stopping himself just in time. He wanted to say; \"Because I love you,\" but all he could get out was; \"I would like to know who you are.\" At her confused look, he went on, hoping that he wasn't scaring her. \"You seemed pretty upset the first time I met you. It looks like that you could use a friend around or two, just to cheer you up.\" Now the hen rolled her eyes, not looking him directly in the eye. \"Just the same as any other day,\" she muttered miserably. \"Hardly important. Though I must say I've never been confronted by a unrelenting rooster such as yourself.\" She tried to move around him to walk by, but the path was still blocked tight. She coughed in exasperation. \"Would you please move?\" \"I thought you might need someone to talk to,\" Azul started. \"Someone who will listen to you, and understand you. Someone who will call on you even when you're feeling down in the dumps, and you feel like the whole world is against you. That could make you feel better about yourself, and maybe you won't sound so bitter all the time.\" He instantly regretted it. The hen's eyes flared up and she scowled again. \"Bitter? How dare you!\" she began, but then her expression softened as her mind must have changed. Her voice lowered and she stared at him again, not seeming so angry anymore. \"And where would I find someone like this?\" she questioned. Azul's heart was thumping madly in his ribcage, he wondered if she could see it trying to get out of his chest. He managed a weak smile, and found his voice at last. \"Well, um…what about me?\" he asked slowly, trying not to sound too desperate for her attention, and all the while staring her in the face, so she would know that he was sincere. Now she seemed uncomfortable. \"Oh. I, hmm…\" Afraid of her refusal, Azul prompted in quickly. \"I know you might be thinking that I'm a complete stranger bringing you on like this…and that I must be getting rather tiresome right now, but…if you would only give me a chance, I'd be there by your side for support anytime that you wanted,\" he blurted out, feeling himself turning crimson for every word that he spoke. At her slight pauses, he felt his heart drop lower. \"If you don't want anything to do with me - \" \"No,\" the hen interrupted him, halting his words with a swift motion of her wing. \"No, it's all right. I can see that you're trying.\" She looked up at him again, her eyes showing such emotion that Azul thought he might explode on the spot. \"You seem to be showing enough effort…I can see that you badly want me to agree to this.\" A small giggle escaped, but it was still a recognisable giggle. She held her wings out in front of her, crossing them. \"What's your name?\" Azul froze. His name...his name? What was it again? He couldn't remember! He started to talk, but found that no words came out. He stared awkwardly at the hen, feeling his legs go numb with embarrassment. She gazed back, seeming impatient. There was a hefty silence between them both; it felt as if it were getting louder with every passing second. \"Um…\" Azul started. This was so humiliating! In the end, he decided to wait until he'd calmed down a little, and until his emotions had settled. Too much excitement sent him into a ludicrous frenzy. \"I-I thought I asked you for yours,\" he quickly recovered, gaining his balance before he could fall flat on his face. She sighed now, probably telling herself not to lose control. \"You change your mind a lot!\" she said rashly, but there was a hint of admiration in the way that she'd said it. \"If you really want to know so badly, my name is Strega,\" she continued, obviously trying not to sound so impressed by it in any way. \"Does that make you happy now? Do you think it'll get you talking again?\" \"Strega…\" Azul whispered out, almost feeling himself floating away. He couldn't care how she was looking at him; he knew her name! And what a glorious name it was! He managed a toothy grin, smiled down at her and felt his eyes burning with fascination. He could almost feel them twinkling, like the stars on a black night. \"That's beautiful…\" he said, under his breath. Strega actually looked surprised. She blinked a few times, regaining herself. Then she darted her eyes away, suddenly interested in the ground. \"Oh. Well, thank you,\" she quickly said, not wanting to glance up just yet. \"It's Italian. My parents were very fond of the language, it's something after a herb…I think.\" Here she paused, suddenly looking flushed, \"W-what about yours?\" This time, the rooster remembered. Maybe it was because of his new discovery, his newfound friend or some new spark from her that startled his own mind. He answered anyway, maybe quicker than he wanted. \"Azul.\" \"And what does it mean?\" Strega whispered. \"It's 'blue' in Spanish. My parents said it was for my eyes,\" Azul replied, unbelievably comfortable now that names had been given out. Suddenly, everything had changed…there wasn't a sense of uneasiness. They weren't strangers anymore. There was a quiet pause again, broken by Strega's soft, soothing voice. \"Hmm. Azul,\" she said the name over again on her tongue, thinking it over in her head. Her chocolate brown eyes lit up as she stared at him. \"I like it.\" Then she smiled for the first time. Azul loved her more than ever after that. He couldn't shake her away from his thoughts; she was on his mind every day, every hour; every minute. Even when they spoke to each other, he couldn't stop wanting to see her again whenever he could. They had become quite close friends, though Strega was known to have a wild temper now and again, but Azul never minded. One time, he had plucked up enough courage to tell her how he felt. It was barely a month after they had met. They were taking a stroll together, and Azul had suddenly felt a burst of confidence with his last look at her. Even though his pulse was maddening, he had felt braver than ever before. He had to ask tonight…otherwise he would have left it too long. \"Strega…\" he began slowly. \"There's something I have to tell you.\" He had often said this before, so her answer was not surprising to him. She sighed edgily…playfully, and her voice was rich and soft. \"Go on, then.\" \"Strega.\" Azul turned her towards him so that their eyes were meeting. She seemed confused, astonished. Her emotions showed nothing except bewilderment; she couldn't stop looking at him in the way that she was then. Even though it distracted Azul a little, he managed to finish off his sentence. \"I've known you only for a month…and it's been the most wonderful month of my life. Thank you so much for sharing it with me.\" \"Um…you're welcome,\" Strega said, and turned to stand by his side again. \"No – wait, I'm not finished,\" Azul cut in quickly, taking her by the wing and pulling her back to the position again, hearing her sigh another time. \"That's not all I wanted to say. I feel as if I've known you my whole life. And I don't want to stop feeling that, Strega. I don't want to stop feeling that.\" Strega glanced at him suspiciously. She probably already had an idea of what he was going to do. \"What are you trying to say?\" she asked carefully. Azul smiled at her. \"I don't care how much it changes, or even ruins what we've got now,\" he said. \"I'm dying from the pain, Strega. I have to say it now or I'll never feel good about myself. I just need to say it…I want you to know, I want you to know that for these past weeks or so, staring into your mind-trapping eyes and gazing at your glossy sun-stripped feathers - \" \"Azul,\" Strega interrupted, wanting him to get to the point. Taking a deep breath, Azul apologised and decided to finish. \"What I'm trying to say is that…I love you, Strega. I've always loved you, ever since I saw you that day in the meadow, picking those flowers. I thought my life had ended; stopped to a standstill at seeing you there. Please, oh, please give me an answer. That's all I have left to hold onto now. Without you, I'm nothing.\" Azul's heart was broken that night. Strega had not taken kindly to his confession, and had denied his love. \"I'm not worth it, Azul,\" she had told him. \"You'll have to find someone else, you deserve better than me. Someone who feels the same way.\" \"And…you don't?\" Azul asked quietly. \"I'm sorry.\" \"But what is it? I told you, I'd be there by your side for support anytime that you wanted. I mean to stick to that…to stand by it,\" Azul muttered desperately, not wanting to let her go so soon. \"I don't regret what I said, I mean every word. And I don't intend to take it back.\" \"I'm sorry, Azul,\" Strega said again. \"I just can't. I don't love you.\" Azul felt shattered. How could this be happening? He loved her so much, he didn't want to let her leave. Gulping and forcing back the urge to shed tears, he found his voice. The pitiful tone it had caused sadness. \"But I love you,\" he gasped. \"Please don't do this to me, Strega. Please don't do this.\" \"I'm really sorry,\" she said again, stepping away, her eyes burning with mixed feelings and her heart somewhere different. \"Find someone else.\" :--: Azul took in a deep breath as he finished the most painful part of his tale. Thinking about Strega again made his heart ache all over. \"After that,\" he told the other chickens, \"I couldn't bear to see her for the hurting. I fixed up a raft, and came here like I told you. I never looked back, and I don't mean to.\" Stopping at last, he looked around at his audience, and gasped. \"Oh, I'm sorry!\" he apologised immediately. Everyone was in tears. Azul couldn't believe how much he had described in detail, he could practically remember every word. He fumbled for his voice, his eyes already beginning to mist up from the memories. \"I-I'm really…\" \"Oh, goodness…poor you!\" one hen erupted, sobbing so hard that it was strange to hear her speak. \"It must have been so hard!\" The hen Agnes was finding it hard to control herself. \"You must stay for a while,\" she said, \"To get over this…we can't face turning you away now with this on your shoulders. We'll talk with Ginger and ask for you.\" At this, there were exclamations of agreement. \"Yes! Yes! Stay! Stay!\" Azul couldn't believe how everyone felt about this. Though it felt good to let go of what had happened and tell everyone else his story, something inside of him felt empty still…hollow and alone. Though he couldn't bear to share his feelings anymore in case of another teary night. He smiled, hoping it would calm everyone down. \"Um…we'll see,\" he finally said, looking around at all of the miserable faces and wet smiles, and wondering how he was ever going to forgive himself. \"We'll see.\" To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: Wow, this chapter was fast. I was done with it in one afternoon. You see, I can update in less than a month! Lol. I've wanted to write this chapter from the beginning of the story anyway, and I'm glad that it's done. Please R&R;!)[Chapter 8] Something Strange (A/N: Gah! I promised that I wouldn't leave it very long and I did! I'm so sorry, but I had huge author's block over the weeks and this chapter has been murder to write. It's probably the hardest one so far, so if it sucks, forgive me, lol. I had so many people thanking me on the last chapter! Thanks so much!) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: Maybe I should apologise first. That was the first thought that Ginger awoke to the next morning, as the sun rose over the island holding a new day in his wake. Since the meeting involving Azul had ended sometime when the moon was full last night, and without Ginger's permission to departure everyone had just scattered and left for their own beds, knowing that the argument between her and Rocky still remained the same. Stubborn as always, both had refused to speak to each other. Ginger knew that they were acting like children, but she just couldn't bring herself to break first. Rocky had been the one who had started it; he was the one who had been so rowdy! All that Ginger had ever wanted was for Azul to have a chance. Which reminded her… Ginger stood up and stepped to the window, looking out at the island before her. It was all so empty now; due to the late night many had preferred to stay in bed. It had been rude of both of them, leaving without saying so and letting Azul handle the crowd on his own. She had been told the story of his life earlier that morning, by one excited hen who wanted to know if she'd seen him around. I never knew. was the thought inside her head. Azul had lost so much. She just hoped that he would feel welcome here. She had to admit, not even herself had made her most promising effort. She had been trying to deal with Rocky. In surprise, Ginger found tears threatening. She forced them back, trying to think. She hated it when she fought with him; their arguments never got them anywhere. It was times like this when she knew that she loved him so much, it hurt her to not be speaking with him. She had been thinking of children again, and wondered how much it would damage her to make things up with him. Sighing, she tore her eyes from the sight outside and made a move to turn. But before she could even take a step, she felt a comforting pressure on her shoulders, halting her still. With a gasp, she spun her head and stared in shock. Rocky. He was standing there with his wings on her own, offering her a soft smile. His brown eyes showed a sense of confession, and his face lit up in warmth. \"Hey,\" he said quietly; even his voice sounding soothing. \"Morning.\" Ginger didn't know what to say. She gulped, \"Listen, Rocky…I - \" \"No, let me, Ginge,\" he answered back. His words full of meaning, he grinned down at her with a friendly tone. \"I'm sorry.\" Ginger almost gasped out loud. He was apologising? But…when did Rocky normally offer an apology before anyone else unless he was talked into it? It was a shock to Ginger, but a pleasant shock. She found a slow smile creeping across her face. \"You're…sorry?\" \"Yeah,\" he said again, his eyes scrunching up a little. \"I didn't mean to act so dumb. I was being stupid – c'mon, we both knew that. I did some thinking last night too, and I saw how annoying I was being, going on like that. I guess I didn't really warm up to that Azul guy much, either.\" Trying not to laugh, Ginger held back her comments. \"Well, he was worried that you wanted to remain a stranger with him for the rest of his life,\" she smiled. \"Especially after everything that's happened to him, he needs some people to talk to.\" Here she paused, uncertain if Rocky knew what she was talking about. \"You… do know what's happened to him, don't you?\" \"Yeah, I know,\" Rocky sighed. \"That kinda makes me feel worse. I heard that chick telling ya at the door this morning. I felt so guilty I thought I was gonna pop. You were right, Ginge. I was being a jealous fool, I was just worried that…well, that ya preferred 'blue-eyes' over me, that's all.\" Blue-eyes? Ginger almost gasped again. He thought that…that she was beginning to get feelings for Azul! It had never occurred to her how much attention she had been giving him since he had arrived; no wonder Rocky was reading all of the wrong signs! \"You think…you thought that…I…\" She was so much of a fluster that she could barely breathe. Poor Rocky, she had never even given that a thought. Trying not to let out a relieved giggle, she stared back up at him. \"Oh, Rocky!\" \"What?\" \"I never thought no such thing!\" she laughed now, her laughter harmonious. \"I was just being friendly! You should have told me, I thought that you were afraid that he was going to soak up all of the attention, or something.\" Rocky couldn't believe it. All the time that Azul had been here, Ginger had gotten so interested in him, and she hadn't an ounce of what he had expected her to have. Friends was fine…he had only worried that it was developing into something more. At least it wasn't, now maybe he could relax a little more. He grinned back at her. \"So, you don't love the guy?\" \"No!\" Ginger protested, sounding elated. \"Of course not. There's only one space for a special rooster in my life, and he's not going to budge, I'm certain. And his handsome brown eyes work wonders for me, anyway.\" She smiled at him again. Rocky smirked cheekily. \"Handsome?\" \"Oh, I'm sorry too,\" Ginger said defeated. \"I was being rather direct. I should have let you explain a little better; I was getting into my own conclusions and not letting yours in. I hope you accept my sincerity as much as I've accepted yours.\" There was a brief silence, which was broken only by a rich and deep laugh, belonging to Rocky. It was smooth, and filled the awkwardness with comfort. \"Geez, Ginge, in America we just say the word!\" he chuckled, but then added with a lighter tone to his voice, \"But, I could get used to your way.\" For the first time since that night on the hill, Rocky and Ginger shared one of their true kisses. It was filled with as much strength as they held between them, as they embraced their fears away. Ginger couldn't contain how much better it made her feel, knowing that Rocky's doubts were free and ready to travel now. Rocky, there's something we need to talk about… In her hug, rather frighteningly, her own confidence startled her. She had only just realised what she had been trying to say in her head. Every time, she just wanted to bring up the subject on children but something had always stopped her. Now, she wanted to say it more than ever but there was still too much going on. She snuggled deeper into Rocky's chest and fought the thoughts away. Later, she reminded herself. Not long now, but soon. \"You need to talk to him,\" she told Rocky a few moments later. \"Alone, both of you. You need to see that you can both be friends.\" She waited a while, letting Rocky's thoughts handle themselves. \"Will you?\" she quietly asked. After a few uncomfortable seconds of pause, she heard his mellow voice speak. \"I, um…I suppose so. Yeah, O.K.\" He sounded a lot confident than if she had asked him days ago. It made her feel better hearing it like that. \"I'll find him for you, then,\" she told him straight. \"Today. I'll tell him that you've agreed to talk to him and get all of this tension removed between you. It might make things easier, and he'll know that others aren't against him for intruding.\" She felt a light kiss on her head, just above her eyes, followed by the sweet, soft sound of Rocky's smile in his tone. \"That would be great.\" :--: Azul wiped perspiration off his forehead as the hot morning sun beat down. Though he was thankful to warm weather, there was a gentle frozen breeze of the dew, which heightened his spirits and made him feel cooler during his hard work. He was still fixing up his raft, and making rather a good job of it. He always had been a handyman, dare he say the right word. It wouldn't take him very long to fix it now, just a while longer. Azul wondered where he would go once it was built to proper again. Off to somewhere new? His heart pounded at the thought of returning back home. He really didn't want to. If Strega found him again, she would only bring more hard times, and he just wanted to get away from everything. It would cause the pain to become fresh. He really liked it here…everyone had welcomed him, well, almost everyone, and he had made so many new friends. Everyone here was so nice. Especially Ginger. \"Azul!\" Quite startled, he straightened up and spun around, his sight landing on Ginger, making her way towards him. He hurriedly put away his rafting gear and turned to face her, hopefully a decent smile on his face. He brushed a little sweat from his eyes. \"Morning, Miss Ginger!\" he greeted back, his voice high and ringing once again. He sounded so much cheerful, maybe it had felt good for him to spill his feelings in front of everyone. He forced back a laugh at her surprised expression. \"Gosh, what have you been doing?\" she questioned. Azul brushed down a few feathers as he thumbed the attention towards his raft. \"Just fixing her up,\" he said briskly. \"Thought I should get started on it, I've left the task undone for a while.\" Ginger looked around him to see how it was coming along. It was a little beaten down, but she could see that he was making progress with it. She felt happy that he was back to doing what he loved most, and she turned back to him with a brightness in her smile. \"You're doing a very good job,\" she commented politely. \"Why, thank you,\" Azul laughed back. \"Sometimes I don't know half of what to say to you, Miss Ginger…you're always ready to hand out compliments.\" His heart grinned to itself inside of him as he saw a blush of modesty spread over her face. Somehow he loved making her do that, it made him smile. Laughing, Ginger faced him properly. \"You can just call me Ginger, if you want,\" she said quietly. \"All of this 'Miss' makes me sound like I'm someone special!\" She didn't really feel like someone to earn such respect. Besides, he never called anyone else with another name in front. She often wondered why. Azul could only chuckle. \"Very well, Ginger.\" He pulled a somewhat strange face at this, trying to hide his embarrassment. \"I'm going to have to get used to that.\" \"Oh, I suppose you will,\" she replied back, hopefully. Thinking back to where she had ventured from to approach him, she brought up the subject that she had wanted to say since that first morning he had arrived. \"Um…\" she mumbled. Frowning, Azul spoke up. \"Ginger? You look troubled. Is something wrong?\" \"No, no…not troubled,\" Ginger cut in, wanting to correct the error quickly. \"I just wanted to know if you…\" She really didn't like to bring it up, often she wondered if she were meddling in their affairs and should let them sort it out for themselves. But they were ready to agree…well, Rocky was anyway. \"If you had any hard feelings on the matter of Rocky's attitude lately. He's been giving you quite the cold shoulder,\" she finished, hoping that she wasn't sounding too quick and precise. She really didn't like to talk about others like this, but Azul had to know, and Rocky wasn't even around to hear anyway. It should be all right. Azul's face lowered at this, and he seemed to be thinking quite hard about something, Ginger couldn't tell what. She was surprised at his voice, she was waiting for it to sound as harsh as it had before the meeting, but instead, it was warm and quiet. \"I was wondering that myself, too,\" he told her. \"I haven't really been friendly, have I?\" \"Oh, well…\" This wasn't going as she had hoped. \"I really want to make things up between us,\" Azul prompted in. \"But I'm not sure if he'll want to talk. I keep getting this feeling like he has something against me. It's the sort of feeling which makes you feel like an outsider; a stranger.\" He grinned at Ginger, taking in the comforting feel of her smile. Ginger could hardly thank someone for anything more. It had been so much easier to think the question than actually say it. Thank goodness Azul wanted to be friends with Rocky too, now maybe this whole episode would be cleared up for good. \"That's brilliant!\" Ginger exclaimed. \"He wanted to patch things up with you, too!\" \"Really?\" Azul sounded a little unsure. \"Yes, we were just talking about it, actually. He said that he'd been feeling somewhat jealous lately, and he wanted to start again, turn over a new leaf. He's always happy to make new friends, I just think that you got off on the wrong foot.\" Ginger was even happier to see that Azul was nodding in agreement. Azul's voice sounded friendlier already, and his eyes shone out with appreciation. \"Anytime he's willing to talk, I'll be ready to start again,\" he said to her with his eyes fixed on her own. \"Thank you for stopping by, Ginger.\" The conversation had gone rather smoothly, for Ginger's opinion, and all in all it pleased her to know that there would be no disagreements towards anyone else on the island. That was what she had wanted from the start, as long as Rocky and Azul were ready to break their shells and come out as friends, it suited her fine. Azul went back to his raft, feeling better already. He really didn't want to be hated on the sanctuary by anybody; it was a feeling that he wasn't prepared for. At least he had Ginger to thank for talking Rocky into his senses, maybe things would be a little easier now. Besides… he thought as he wound some more rope around the wood joints, Green eyes are a bit of a refreshing change from chocolate brown… To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: Uh-oh. What have I done? I hated writing this chapter, and I say sorry again if it's not as good as you all wanted it to be! I promise that in future there will be better ones. I hope this pleases some anyway! Please R&R;!)[Chapter 9] Cockfighting (A/N: A new chapter at last! I'm so sorry about my updating, but I've been struggling along with other things during last week and I've gotten so far behind. Plus, it's my birthday next week and all of my friends are creeping around me…I know they're up to something, but they won't tell me, lol. Thank you to those who reviewed chapter 8!) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: A pair of brown eyes squinted up at the midday sun, his dark feathers shielding his sight. The rays hung down warm on his body, a pleasant breeze cooling his senses. The day had been one of the warmest that the island had ever known about. Not even Fowler could recall a day that the heat had betrayed them to its extent. Rocky frowned up at the sky. Usually he craved for the Summer mornings, but this one was a push-and-shove. He growled a little under his breath as he swiped sweat from his brow. \"Stupid heat.\" Often the temperature was so intense the hens had to retire to their bunks; especially those that burned easily (the idea of roast chicken frightened some), and had departed to the safe and cooling shade of their huts. Babs claimed she grew faint, due to sunstroke, which after minutes of seeing her toddling about worse than usual, insists were immediately made. Everything seemed to be getting towards a level today for Rocky. Not only did he have to put up with the sun, he had also had a request from Ginger, that Azul was ready to talk things through with him after all. Of course, Rocky was prepared for such a meeting, but it was the first step. He didn't seem so bad…maybe they could get along pretty easily. \"This is a great opportunity for the both of you to be friends! I knew you would come through, maybe after this there won't be so much avoidance!\" Ginger's words were still left ringing in his ears. She wanted so much for the both of them to get along – Ginger liked it if everyone got along. Ever since the darkness of Tweedy's farm, she had wanted everyone to start a new, with no arguments and no grudges…just for everyone to be friends and live a content, peaceful life. With guilt, Rocky knew that he hadn't lived up to her hopes and standards as much as he would have liked to. He had begun a whole new string of arguments since Azul had appeared, and he had been offering a shunning proposition whenever he came within contact. He really hadn't been supportive at all. He felt as if he were letting Ginger down, which is why he felt the need to apologise. \"I guess I did go a bit overboard,\" he said aloud, not caring who heard. Now he was waiting for Azul to meet him, Ginger had informed that he would be on his way soon. Though he didn't feel nervous, he still felt uncomfortable. There had been such distances between them lately… what was he to say? He rubbed the back of his neck to hide the heat away, and kicked a little at the ground, his feet brushing the tips of the grass. Smiling down at the colour, he thought back to Ginger, remembering the first time he had looked properly into her eyes. So green…as green as the grass he stood on now. She had carried it along with her the whole time, even though she had wanted it for a lifetime. Even though she had already found it… A faint shadow blocked out the sunlight, softening the strictness of the warmth. He glanced up, and noticed no other than Azul making his way over to him, a sort of uneasy feel in his step. Rocky could tell that he wasn't as confident as Ginger had made out to be. Promising himself to be friendly, Rocky pulled a suitable smile and managed a small wave. \"Hey,\" he called out, watching Azul as he caught his attention. \"Hello,\" Azul countered back, but it was so quiet under his breath that Rocky wasn't even sure if he had meant to say it. The notion that he wasn't at all pleased about talking made Rocky gain the uncomfortable feeling once again. What were they possibly going to talk about if neither felt friends to do so? Trying to seem convinced than he felt, Rocky stepped over to Azul and immediately made the first effort to speak. By the look in the other rooster's eyes, he clearly didn't feel good starting a conversation going. He appeared fidgety, and insecure, and his glances didn't always meet Rocky's own. \"So…er,\" Rocky began slowly, taking the time to spend as long as he could, so that he didn't end up shutting Azul out so quickly than he intended. \"Did – did Ginger tell ya about…y'know, about the – the talk?\" \"Oh…yes – yes, she did.\" \"Great. Me too.\" There was another long pause. It was down obvious that this was the hardest conversation that Rocky had ever taken part in. Usually he was so alive and open with himself when meeting new people, but since that Azul was so quiet and preserved, he was finding it a bit difficult. Clearing his throat, he decided to try again. \"How's about the weather, huh?\" \"W-what?\" Azul sleepily asked, not understanding at first. \"The…y'know, the weather. Kinda hot, wouldn't ya say?\" Rocky knew that he was playing the biggest card on the nervous deck. Whenever anyone felt uncomfortable, they always brought up the weather in their talk. He hoped that Azul didn't know this too, as he was beginning to stare at him strangely. Instead, he nodded slowly. \"Oh, yes. Quite one of the hottest days I've seen,\" he told him, starting to look a little lost and bored. It was clear that he wasn't enjoying himself. The expression sort of angered Rocky a bit; he was trying his best to be friends and he wasn't getting any reception. He fought his head with everything he could remember about introducing yourself mannerly, hoping that Azul couldn't see him struggling with his thoughts. He thought back to one time, when he could still hear Ginger telling him over and over again, so clear that he could recite it himself: \"The problem with most people is that they're so preoccupied with how they are, they don't know how to make a proper introduction. It annoys me when they act so interested in themselves than others, I just wish they would ask more questions now and again.\" Maybe he should try that. Ginger's words normally made enough sense. Straightening up now that he had a new idea, he spoke in what he wished sounded polite. \"So…Azul, is it? I heard ya at the meeting the other night, talking to the other guys. Um…ya said something about building, fixing. Is…is it any good?\" Oh, how Rocky wished he could laugh at this point! Azul was staring at him in such amazement, he didn't know what to say. Obviously, he was not expecting this other rooster to put more than two sentences next to each other, and make a suitable subject to talk about. Blinking at last, he found his voice somewhere. \"I – I, well…I rather enjoy it,\" he said, a life suddenly coming into his voice as he spoke about what he loved to do. \"I never seem to tire of it, actually. I used to spend most of my time trying to see what would work, and what wouldn't. I became quite the handyman,\" here he paused; somewhat delighted that he had managed to carry on the talk with his own speech. \"What about you?\" \"Nah, I'm not really cut out for all of that stuff,\" Rocky admitted. \"I sort a few things out now and again but I'm not good. I bet ya know what ya doing when it comes down to it, right?\" Azul actually smiled back. \"Sometimes.\" They shared a laugh. Neither knew where it came from, what they had said hadn't been particularly funny to hear, but it just seemed to lighten the mood a little more. Now that they had begun to open up about their hobbies, the tension was starting to cease. Well, whaddya know? Ginger's advice works after all. Here again, Rocky raised his wing over his eyes once more and shielded them from the blinding light. He released an exhale of breath, sounding exhausted. \"Phew! Hey, this sun is murder, I'm dying in this heat,\" he told Azul, feeling another bead of perspiration trickle down his forehead. \"What d'you say we talk in the shade?\" Azul nodded in agreement as he brushed at his own brow. \"Sounds good to me.\" :--: It all fell into place after that. Conversation between Rocky and Azul flowed together, literally like words on a page and water in a brook. They sat amongst the shade of a dampened old willow tree, fresh and moist despite the sun, and chatted like they had known one another for years. They spoke together, Rocky mentioning the 'guy talk' every now and again. He had never quite realised how much he had missed that. Fowler often didn't apply to good company when it came to talking much about the younger generation, and Azul offered a better aspect on things. They laughed, told jokes and shared some moments from the past. Azul opened up again to Rocky about Strega, and how it all went wrong for him. Neither one couldn't understand what had been keeping them back from connecting like this. It was almost as if they were meant to be friends. Neither could remember why they had been avoiding one another so much. \"Y'know,\" Rocky spoke up in between breaths, \"I'm kinda glad that Ginge decided for us to have this talk. She really knows what to do.\" \"Yes,\" Azul sighed a little, hoping to stop his chest from aching. \"She's great.\" There was a moment's silence as they stopped to think. A calming breeze entered the shade and refreshed the scorching air. The sound of shrill birds rang out in the clouds, and it was so peaceful just to sit there and want nothing at all, that both roosters were quiet, something that they hadn't been in a long time. Azul was the first to break that. \"Ginge…\" he repeated, murmuring. \"Is that a nickname, or something like that?\" \"Hm? Oh, yeah. Something that's kinda stuck on her, I think. She's pretty used to it,\" Rocky replied, thinking back to her again. Where would he be right now, without her to usher him along? Not sitting under a cooling willow with friends and a steady relationship, that's for sure. He lowered his eyes into a slight frown, turning properly back to meet Azul's own. \"Did, er…did you ever have any names like that? F-for your chick?\" He was expecting silence, a moment of rare uneasiness at the mention of her, as if he weren't ready to spring back into topic again. But although Rocky could clearly see the detachment and pain in his face, he found his voice anyway. \"No, not really,\" he said. \"I suppose I didn't know her long enough for that.\" \"Oh.\" Rocky had landed them in a pickle. He knew that he shouldn't have asked that question, but he was just being curious. Azul had hardly ever mentioned anything deep enough about Strega; he had only wanted to investigate the matter, that's all. There was another pause, not so uncomfortable as expected but still rather stretching. Azul lowered his blue eyes to the floor, smiled to himself and ran his dark wing over the soft grass. He pried a tiny stalk from the ground and ran it through his feathers, not satisfying in the touch but just mainly in the colour of life. Rocky watched him, in surprise. He seemed so quiet all the time…almost as if he had his own world that he visited and let nobody come along. The looks in his face that he was thinking were sometimes so unpredictable; you couldn't tell what he was saying to himself. Azul sighed. \"Rocky,\" he asked slowly, \"What is the future?\" \"Huh?\" the rooster slipped out, a little stupidly. He frowned; feeling confused, and watched the face next to him. Why had he suddenly gone into matters concerning the future? If it was one thing, Rocky usually hated talking about it. He liked to wait for what would come, and plan later. It made him feel strange talking about events that hadn't even happened yet. \"The future,\" Azul repeated, still thoughtful. \"What is it?\" \"Um…\" Rocky halted. What was he supposed to say? \"I guess, that…we can never really know, can we? I mean…it's out there, and we can't see it. Ya have to wait, I suppose. No good planning your chicks before they hatch, huh?\" Chicks? Hatch? Rocky wondered exactly what he was leading to. \"You mean…family?\" Azul whispered out dryly. There was another silence. Rocky practically stopped breathing. Family? The word sometimes frightened him, when he put his mind to the basics. What was really waiting for him down that open road, except a new life? The future? He could only imagine. He thought about the other girls. All of the children they had, and Ginger left without a single one. He remembered back to how twitchy she had been lately. Was it what she wanted? Was it what she had always wanted? He gulped, remembering that he hadn't answered Azul's question. Shifting to a new position on the grass, he cleared his throat for time. \"I…I…\" He could feel Azul's piercing eyes watching him, oblivious to the fact that hundreds of thoughts were trampling Rocky's mind. Children? Ginger? Us? \"I…er, dunno,\" he finally said, darting his gaze away from the stares. So after that, they settled and fell back into their usual conversation, the future still left open and gaping to them, and still them with their own unanswered questions. Or maybe they already had been asked, but there were no responses to them? Neither rooster could tell the difference at all. Rocky's expression now sat in thought, his dark eyes searching the skies and his sight tracing the cloud patterns of the day. He couldn't concentrate, at least not for a while, yet. Those thoughts, however…still crossed his mind and galloped through his head for that hour still, and maybe longer. To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: I'm sorry if I kept this chapter away from you for so long, but as you can see by my timing that it wasn't as difficult to write as the last one, so its done pretty early! I hope you like it, please tell me what you think! Please R&R;!)[Chapter 10] Lingering Longer (A/N: Another late update! I'm really sorry, but this chapter was another one of those that I didn't particularly enjoy writing, probably because it introduced Nick and Fetcher and I don't think I can write them all that well. Anyway, thank you for being patient and here's chapter 10!) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: The news that Rocky had brought for Ginger that following afternoon had sent an instant smile to his face. She had been so overjoyed that he and Azul had broken the ice, and had decided to make amends between the both of them. When Rocky had explained in large detail about what they discussed (minus the 'family' talk of course), she could barely believe how quickly they had bonded. She knew it had been a bright idea of hers for them to talk, now she felt as if there were no secrets kept anymore. She had hugged Rocky in delight, and as he returned it gratefully, something deep within his stomach kept prodding him over and over again that if he had let slip of something else, something involving other than inventing, or beholding the future…something to do with youngsters, and hatching… He had turned his head away from such thoughts at the moment. What would Ginger think of him now, if he had suddenly brought up this subject? Maybe she would be surprised, certainly…especially if she weren't ready. What if she liked Rocky to be the way that he was now? Without dedication to a family life, and to be single and open to her, and only her? It frightened him a little, knowing that this next stretch in the emptiness had seemed to jump up and hit him in the face so quickly, he had hardly any time to react. The word 'children' appeared as such a huge step to the next stage, and he wondered what his own response would be. Crying at all hours, up all night…new words, new steps, a boy, girl…a name? And the sweetest possession anyone could ever own. Rocky had always been good with kids, his mother had said so herself. The idea of at least having one brought a new sensation into the pit of his stomach. Was it sickness, or something else? For the time being, he agreed to ponder, and pay attention to other things until the meaning had settled in. Two days had passed, and during the early hours of the morning (less warmer as the chickens noticed, gratifyingly a relief), Ginger was late to rise, rather unusual as she was normally one of the first to be up and about. Rocky had made the infinitive decision to leave her as she was. A lot had happened and he supposed she needed rest. He had given her a tiny kiss on the cheek before leaving their hut, and stepping out into the open. A slight fog was around, wet and cold on the breath, due to the chills of the previous night. Many of the hens were out enjoying it, especially those who had suffered terribly from the heat in the earlier week. Rocky strode through the mingled grass and let his feet take him away, all he needed was a walk to clear his head. Azul could be seen already, working away in his own little corner at the raft, his back to the others and his busily constructing a minor noise on the sanctuary. Rocky offered a small smile towards him, even though he couldn't see it. He now knew about this newcomer, and his painful past, and couldn't help feeling terrible for all of the fuss he made. Of course Ginger didn't have feelings for him, it had all been a mistake, she didn't change her mind so suddenly as that. \"Whoa - \" Rocky's breath caught in his throat as he felt a little bump against his leg, a tiny squeal and then the sound of rushing grass as someone fell over (softly, mind). A chuckle came from him as he looked down to see one of Babs' children, her little son Archie, kicking his tiny legs in the air and wailing in surprise. \"Hey, kiddo!\" said Rocky, lifting up the chick with little force and setting him down on the ground. \"Y'know ya have to watch where you're going, before ya bowl someone over. There could've been sores approaching!\" Little Archie was only a few months old, Babs' youngest child out of her three. Her other two little girls, Beth and Susie, were almost one year. They all had her clueless blue eyes, and her sweet nature, though Archie was the only one to suffer from her terrible memory problems. He liked nothing better than to spend his time spinning in circles, wondering if it would get him anywhere. It obviously didn't. Archie squeaked as Rocky helped him up. \"Where's those sisters of yours, buddy?\" Rocky asked kindly. \"I guess they ran off and left ya, huh? Whaddya up to, being so far away from ya mom? C'mon,\" The rooster picked up the lad in his wings and lifted him over his shoulder, all the while him chirruping away as if lost in some game. Rocky's brown eyes softened at the sounds, and he bit down on his beak as he spotted Babs in the distance, knitting away as she normally spent her time. He could barely make out the future invention of a baby blue woollen hat, for her son it seemed. He swallowed a little and lifted Archie higher on his shoulder. \"Hey, I think we've got a mother in sight!\" he said. :--: The rest of that day, Rocky left Ginger to herself. He thought that she was beginning to look overworked with all of the oncoming arrangements, and he thought it best to stay out of her way a little. With her temper, and with all of the stress, he did what he could to be of a coward and flee (of course as a joke, taken). Instead, he spent the rest of his time prowling about the island, not intending on being bored but not finding anything else to do, he flooded his mind with unanswered questions and dwelled on other matters. Now he sat below the old willow tree again, deep and relaxed in the shade where he had spent most of his earlier hours talking with Azul. He rested his head against the thick trunk and let his head swim, all of his memories of Ginger's worry coming into mind, and he himself trying to place her motives into what he was suspecting. Did she really want children? That night on the hills, she had been so thoughtful… But was he ready to become a father? He wasn't sure, and he was uncertain if it suited him or not. Rocky Rhodes? The Lone Free Ranger, a dad? Maybe to many youngsters if it turned out right, but right now…thinking about it like this, all alone, he felt sick. \"What's a guy to do?\" he groaned. \"Hey up, what's all this then?\" came a sly, crafty voice from below, and Rocky turned his attention away from the sky and towards the ground, where the two rats, Nick and Fetcher stood. The chief swindlers of the farm, they had followed the chickens around at no cost, wanting their eggs (dear to the hens at that time) for agreements to help them in their escapades. Now, being away from all of that, they had relaxed into the sociality and ecstasy of the island, and had exchanged their usual business suits to more attention-grabbing holiday shirts and shorts. Their Hawaiian colours today didn't seem to cheer Rocky up at all; he just sighed under his breath and frowned a little. \"What do you want?\" \"We're here to help you out, gov,\" Nick said with a smile. Rocky pulled a face in what he hoped was a sneer. \"Not to be rude, guys,\" he said. \"But I don't think I need any help right now…or want it for that matter. You're probably just wasting ya time.\" He placed his head into his cupped wings. This didn't stop the rats, however. They scuttled in close, ignoring the shuns. Nick grinned slyly as he said, \"Noticing that over a while, your strategic face has fallen into place with the dirt – where it tends to belong in my own honest opinion – anyhow,\" He waved his hands about. \"We were just wondering - \" \"What was up!\" Fetcher finished gleefully for him. Rocky scoffed. \"Like you guys would wanna know.\" \"C'mon, mate!\" Nick chuckled. \"I can tell something's up, or you wouldn't want to keep it a secret so much, now would you? What is it? Nothing wrong with the little missus perhaps?\" \"Not been bothering, has she?\" Fetcher enquired. \"No!\" Rocky blurted before he even had chance to consider it, and realised that he hadn't meant to say anything at all. \"No…t-that's not it…\" But his own hesitation frightened him in a way. Was it any of their business in the first place? And how did they always seem to know that something wasn't right? It was creepy. The two rats exchanged unsatisfied glances. \"Um-hm. Course.\" Rocky rolled his eyes and turned away from them, his eyes lost in a deep frown. What was it to them why he was so down in the dumps? It wasn't like their minds would ever cross what he was thinking of right now. It was more a state of family matters, one left to think alone and…besides, he had never been the best of friends with the rats, not after the whole situation with the eggs. He didn't know why they were coming over anyway, except to cause trouble and be an annoyance. \"Shut up,\" he snapped. \"Go away.\" \"Well, that's gratitude for you, eh, Fetcher?\" Nick pretended to be insulted as he mocked Rocky's remark. \"Can't even help a fella out anymore, what's this world coming to, I wonder?\" \"Terrible,\" Fetcher finished echoingly. \"Got no manners, he hasn't.\" \"Precisely my point,\" said Nick, turning point. \"Come along, Fetcher, if he don't want to talk to us, I don't see why we're wasting our energy standing over here like ninnies. Let's go and leave him to disintegrate.\" \"That means crumble,\" added Fetcher. They walked off, away from Rocky and headed for the centre of the island. Of course, the rooster didn't spend all of his time crumbling, he spent it to think. And maybe they had been right…he shouldn't have really told them to go. They knew what he had been pondering on, but how? Had he been that obvious towards it? Had he spoken aloud without even realising? They were the only ones he could share with. But that all depended on one thing…could he trust them? What's to say that they would share the secret themselves, going off and spreading it far and wide for everyone to hear? And what if Ginger got hold of it? Rocky couldn't even bear to think. So why did he do it? \"Hey, guys! Come back!\" he called in exasperation, his mind lost to his own troubles. To his surprise, and to his fullest extent of anger, he spotted them barely just poking their heads out from behind the nearest tree, chortling and sniggering to themselves. \"You bellowed?\" Nick joked. Rocky found his frown returning. So they hadn't gone after all! They somehow, again knew that he was going to call them back, so they had waited for him on purpose. How did they always guess what he was going to do? For a moment, all the thoughts were telling him to just get up and leave them to their joke. But he needed someone to talk to. He just hoped they wouldn't say anything. \"OK,\" he began. \"I'm not even gonna begin to say how spooky that is, for a start. And…I guess you've kinda gotta point. I have problems, all right – I'm full of 'em, and at the moment, I'm stocked to the top.\" That was true. He couldn't even remember the last time that he had felt so confused as this, and it was all to do with a change of events. Why did everything have to differ from what it had been? It had been fine. \"Allow us,\" Nick butted in, both of them stepping out from behind the tree now. They stood up tall, looking important, and straightened out the creases in their shirts. \"Ever since that new bloke's dropped in for a surprise visit, it's got you wired, hasn't it mate?\" \"And you thought he was playing in on your girl,\" Fetcher grinned. \"Somehow – and I know this is right, he's told you a cockamamie story of what's being happening to himself, hoping for self pity and all of that.\" \"And you were feeling jealous. So what he does, you see…he plays the friendship card, and you fall right smack into his trap, like, er…like a mackerel!\" \"So now…your feelings are twaddle, aren't they? Are we right? Tell us we're right.\" Rocky couldn't believe how accurate they had been. In amazement, all he could manage was a numb nod and a humble grin. Deep down, his feelings indeed were mixed up, as he was unsure about everything. He wasn't sure if he really liked the idea of everyone knowing what he was thinking, he didn't want to come off at the thought of being read so easily. But then…the rats hadn't guessed the biggest part of his mind, which had been troubling him. They couldn't possibly know the true wanting that he held, to finally come to the realisation that children might not be so bad. And he was still trying to find the strength and courage of telling this to Ginger himself. Could he do that? So soon? How long would it take him…in the end? He showed up his expression as a sign of relief, pretending to look horrifyingly sick at the thought that they knew what had been happening, and drew back a thankful smile as he stared down at their swaggering, cheesy expressions. \"Yeah…guys,\" he agreed stiffly. \"You're right.\" As Nick and Fetcher obtained adequate glances, and prouder than proud exclamations, Rocky secretly stared up at the sky, and was lost in the peaceful bliss of the clouds as he breathed out a long, breathless sigh. Everything would fall in place soon. It just needed the time to get there. And on the wind in the distance, the faint, cheerful but chirpy sound of Archie's laugh floated to Rocky's hearing, and it somewhat seemed to encourage him, sending a new found feeling into his heart that he had liked, but had never encountered before in his life. To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: Ugh, this chapter was terrible. It took me ages to write and get it down, I think it must be the hardest one to write so far. Anyway, it might not be the best update, but the story is gradually reaching its end, and I should get there someday. For now, please R&R;! Rocky will have cookies if you do! Rocky runs from the sugar )[Chapter 11] A Simple Mind (A/N: I'm sorry I've left this story for so long, I've had a lot to catch up with in my other stories, as you may have noticed. I haven't forgotten this though!) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: The advice from Nick and Fetcher kept Rocky on his toes all of that afternoon, and most of the following day too. He could simply not believe how easy it was to read him – were others on the island getting the same signals as those rats? What if Ginger had noticed? he thought to himself with a grimace. There was no doubt that he was feeling uncomfortable. Because of the strange entries that were blocking his memory, he tried to avoid Ginger for some time, afraid that she may be onto his secret and his feelings. The last thing he wanted was to discuss this sort of thing, especially when this whole situation with Azul was beginning to spiral now in a new direction. Speaking of Azul, he had noticed Rocky's strange behaviour too, only the signals he read were different than the ones Rocky had considered. Noticing that Rocky was keeping away from Ginger, Azul thought back to the night of their argument, when he was just settling down to tell the tale of his lost love. He had noticed their disappearance, and thought back to what they said. :--: Azul listened as he spoke, his hearing picking up Ginger's voice. She sounded rather exasperated, and he strained to gain a part in each conversation. \"He wanted to explain tonight,\" she said. \"And besides, why is it bothering you so much? You found your answer, didn't you? You wanted to know what his name meant so I arranged to tell you.\" Azul knew that they had been talking about him, and he knew that he had somehow started the whole argument in the first place, by telling Rocky what he wanted to know. He hadn't meant to come off as cold, but from the beginning he had been rather jealous of the rooster. He was handsome, and amusing, and didn't linger on unrequited love as he did. And he had Ginger... He had heard Rocky's voice then. \"It's just really shown me up, that's all.\" \"Oh, well, I'm sorry!\" Ginger had cried. Azul was startled at her tone, she sounded furious. Furious with Rocky? Did she often get that way? He hadn't been there that long, he wouldn't know. Still, he was surprised at the way she had spoken to him. Ginger continued in that same anger: \"Sorry for 'showing you up', I must feel terrible! Not everyone bows to you whenever you want, Rocky! You don't need all the attention...all the time! Can't you at least show some respect for others?\" So Rocky hadn't respected him at first. That basically had explained a lot about his attitude. And he had felt strange at Ginger's sarcastic tone, and the way she had spoken of 'respect'. Were they in a troublesome relationship? Maybe it was Ginger's hint to Rocky to move on and find someone else. \"I'm really sorry, Azul...find someone else...\" Strega's voice. Everything was just so confusing. :--: \"Ouph!\" Azul was brought back to the real world as he sharply bumped into an unknown hen, toppling and hearing her squeal as she plopped back onto her rear, sending him a few paces back. What a dope! What an idiot! What an ars – He quickly straightened up. \"Ah, no! I'm sorry!\" he said in apology, bending low and taking hold of her wings, helping her up (though it took a while, she was rather weighty). \"I'm such a clumsy – I wasn't looking!\" \"Oh, that's quite all right,\" the hen said in a sweet voice. It was Babs. She struggled to get back onto her feet, they kicked in the air as she tried. Eventually (with much help from Azul), she managed to stand up straight again, wobbly and with a goofy smile on her face. Azul felt so stupid. \"I'm sorry, Miss,\" he said. \"You must excuse me. I have a habit of doing ridiculous things when I'm on the other side of the clouds. I hope you're not hurt,\" he added. Babs shook her head. \"No, no, it's fine, really,\" she said. \"I was busy thinking meself. At least, that's what it looked like you were doing...thinking...I do that sometimes too, when I get a thought in me head,\" she smiled, pointing towards her head as in proof of evidence. \"I was just having a talk with Beth, my little girl – such a lovely thing she is too...she's talking about going on holiday!\" She looked aghast at the thought. Azul actually laughed. \"I keep telling her,\" Babs continued. \"We are on holiday, sweetheart! We're going to be on holiday forever! A forever holiday!\" She smiled, a dreamy look coming over her face. It caused Azul to smile again. \"I suppose you like the occasional holiday,\" he suggested. \"Oooh – yes, love! All the time!\" Babs said. \"It was rare we got one, back at the farm and everything, so it was always exciting. And now it's come true.\" She grinned and pulled her wings together, as if to get back to her knitting, but there was nothing in her wings. She frowned and started to look below her feet. Azul nodded in response. He had heard – not long before his journey the tale of Tweedy's farm and the chickens that had escaped from it. But it was only now that he realised the chickens were his very friends. The thought excited him and sorrowed him. Breaking from his thoughts, he looked down and pulled a face, humoured by Babs, staring down around in the grass and with a clueless notion about her. He tried to hold back a laugh as he bent down to inspect her search. \"W-what are you doing?\" he asked. \"What are you looking for?\" \"My knitting, silly,\" Babs said. \"It's always losing me.\" \"Here, let me help,\" Azul offered. \"I have a gift for sharp eyes, you know.\" \"Well, be careful you don't cut yourself!\" Babs exclaimed with sudden concern. Azul didn't respond, but just smiled to himself. He could tell that she was a little far behind in the real world, but he didn't mind right now. His eyes peered deep into the grass and finally spotted what she was looking for. \"Oh, here - \" he said, just at that moment when Babs said: \"I see it!\" Bump. Both chickens had collided heads when reaching down for the knitting. They stood up, rubbing their heads and smiling uncomfortably, Azul with his mellow chuckle and Babs with her high giggle. \"I'm sorry,\" said Azul. Babs again, said it was nothing. She retrieved her knitting from the rooster and both began to fall back into a conversation again. Azul couldn't believe how anyone could be so buoyant in everything they did. She seemed so happy all the time, as if life was treating her well – and it had always treated her well, and if she had lived a perfect dream. She didn't seem to show any sign of discomfort. \"You told that story,\" said Babs. \"The one about love.\" Azul looked down. He wished he hadn't come out all famous and pitiful in his first few weeks. It was all anyone ever talked to him about now, how that things would eventually work out for him and how he would move on. Even when he wasn't there he could swear that others were talking about him. \"Yes,\" he said. Babs now frowned. \"You went ahead and told everyone your name, didn't you? And...crumbs, now I've plum forgotten! Imagine that!\" \"Imagine that, indeed,\" Azul said. \"Could you tell me, again, please? I tend to forget. Now I know it began with an 'A'...\" \"Azul,\" the rooster prompted in, not wanting to go straight into a guessing game. \"My name is Azul, Miss. You were almost close enough.\" His sentence was finished by another one of Babs' confused faces. She scratched at her head, and a befuddled look came into her eyes, of a pastel blue. \"My name is Babs, not 'Miss' – begging your pardon, and... Azul! That's what it was!\" She squealed aloud and clapped. \"I remember now!\" Azul wondered if she had a poor memory. He didn't want to bring it up, but the thought pounded on his brain. Being the polite soul that he was, he kept it inside, focusing on the hen's bright wit and sense. \"Babs,\" he repeated. \"That's right, I remember you now also.\" \"You do?\" She sounded delighted. Azul let out a chuckle of his. \"It seems we're both suffering victims of forgetting each other's names, aren't we? It's not often I do that...it's just there's so many of you here, I've been around for a few months but I haven't really settled into that category yet. I'm still learning a little.\" Babs nodded, agreeing. \"Everyone says I'm 'inclined to disregard' but I don't know what they mean,\" she said, sighing in exasperation. \"It's so hard now to get a few normal words out of people.\" I wonder what her definition of normal is? Azul wondered. \"So what are your plans for today, Miss Babs?\" he asked. Babs giggled. \"Miss Babs – makes me sound all important, it does!\" She thought hard. \"Oooh, I'm just around for a stroll today, maybe taking little Archie for a walk, teach him how to say things properly, just the small things.\" \"Teaching him how to... say things properly?\" \"Yes! He says such funny things sometimes. He says 'fan' instead of 'fun', 'talk' instead of 'walk', so when he wants to say: 'let's go for a walk', he says: 'let's go for a talk', and I end up thinking that something's happened!\" She shook her head as if it were a pitiful crime. \"And instead of saying: 'hit', he says: 'git',\" she said, sorrowfully. Azul forced to hold back a laugh, as Babs seemed very serious. \"Oh, dear,\" he managed. \"I know,\" Babs groaned. \"It's a hard shame, it is.\" \"Who's Archie?\" Azul wanted to know. He already seemed to have an idea, but he had to make sure. Besides, he was interested in her answer. Everything she seemed to say made him smile. Babs got back to her knitting, her wings working up and down, the fabric of her wool baby blue. \"Archie? He's my little boy. Working on to a few months old now, he is. My baby girls, Beth and Susie, are almost one, aw. They're cute things.\" \"Three children? Don't they become a bit of a handful?\" \"Um...not really,\" Babs said. \"At least, not yet.\" \"Ah, I see.\" Azul and Babs talked long into the night, until the sun began to set and a gentle pink and orange light began to touch the hills of the sanctuary. Azul barely noticed the time at all. Listening to Babs was very entertaining, and it was better than pretending to work away at his raft anyway (Babs had already complimented him on his work, as Azul had glumly told her that it wasn't finished yet). \"It's looking good!\" she said. \"Almost looks done!\" Azul couldn't really say anything to that, but just accepted her appreciation. It wasn't until the stars began to appear that Babs pointed out it was getting dark, and made her way back to her hut, saying a polite goodnight to Azul and gathering her children on her journey. Azul watched after her, sighing and scuffing the ground with his feet. All of this talk about children with Babs reminded him of Rocky, and the talk they had the other day. And thinking of Rocky reminded him of Ginger. What could he do? He missed her. He hadn't seen her all day. It was driving Azul crazy, wondering whether Rocky and her were really over for good. He made a mental note to speak to Rocky tomorrow, hinting towards that fact. After all, they were more than definition friends now, everything would work out. He stepped over towards the riverbank to think, looking out across the waters and thinking of Strega, and his old home. His eyes cast down on his raft, simple pieces of logs tied together with rope, and hid it behind a tall grass area. It was fixed. To be continued :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (Sorry about the wait for this chapter. : smile : Please tell me what you think!)[Chapter 12] Maybe Friends (A/N: I return to you again, after what feels like a lifetime of despair! I'm so sorry, guys, if you only knew what I've been going through all of this time you would understand, but now I make it all up to you with a chapter. I hope you all forgive me: deals out all of the brownies, shrooms and chocolate drops she can find :) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: \"Stupid, stupid, stupid...you are so, stupid... \" Thick clouds blocked out the afternoon heat as they folded over the sky. They sheltered Azul carefully, hiding him away in the shade. Even in the cool he felt sweat running down his forehead, as he tugged lazily at the rope around the joints on his raft. He grit his teeth, thinking: Nerves, nerves! That's all it is! What else could it be, I'm not doing any flippin' work to get me sweating! He wiped away at his head with the back of his wing, and shot a glance over his shoulder. He couldn't keep up this game for long – too soon he would be discovered and then the whole suspicion would be afoot. Azul, their brave, sensitive hero would be nothing more than a smudge on the cover of their weekly magazine. He hadn't been a liar, no, no! Far too harsh a word – too harsh. Besides...he could never create someone like Strega and pretend that she was a fiction in his brain. He tossed his tool down into the grass. Strega! It was all her fault he was here. She drove him away, unwanted. Turned him off like a slap in an argument, and he was still recovering from the after burn. He had come all of this way to get as far away from her as he could. Staying there, seeing her everyday and hearing her tinkle of a laugh would eventually bring him to madness. He wanted to get even somehow, make her hurt... show her how it really felt to have the heart ripped out of his chest. \"Gak, Strega!\" he said, angrily. \"I hate you.\" Tears stung his eyes. \"I hate you, I hate you, I hate you,\" he growled. He pulled tight on the rope, pulling and pulling until every pore in his body screamed for breath. He used it as a stress relief, to force all of the anger out of his system. He never used to do it that often, come to think of it... Strega... He stopped, panting, fully washed of his rage. Guilt coursed through him. Dear, sweet, Strega...how could I think those things? How could I say those things? She's my angel, my first love, my everything – and she hates me, it's my fault it all happened, she's not the one to blame... \"No,\" he whispered, dropping his wings. \"No, I'm sorry...I didn't mean it. It's my fault. My fault. Blame me!\" He numbly reached out and picked up his tool. \"I don't hate you, I don't!\" he cried. \"I don't hate you.\" Who am I talking to? She's not here. \"I'm hoping that's a good start,\" came Rocky's laugh from behind him. Fool! Azul abruptly spun around. Rocky and Ginger stood there, watching him with careful eyes. Ginger's especially were filled with confusion. She stood a little bit out in front, a subtle frown crossing her eyes and her foot tapping (as it always did when she was concerned about something). Rocky seemed more at focus with looking for glimpses of sunshine at the moment. \"Roc – Ginger!\" Azul spluttered. Ginger stared, softness in her voice. \"What are you doing?\" \"Do – doing... ?\" Azul pushed large layers of grass around his raft, surrounding it. He felt his cheeks flame up in embarrassment, and hoped he wasn't turning red. Mentally he pounded himself for being such a delinquent. The tool was hidden behind his back. \"Why, nothing!\" he gulped. \"You sure?\" Rocky finally asked him. He laughed to himself heartily at Azul's expression. It certainly didn't look too well at all. Pale, and clammy...his eyes wouldn't stop staring open. \"Looks like you're chokin' on a bug!\" Rocky chuckled. Ginger groaned to herself and gave him a shove, causing loss of balance and sending him on a roll down the nearest hill. \" Whoa! Boy !\" Azul held back a laugh, removing his grin when Ginger turned back to him. \"I've been meaning to do that for a while,\" she joked. Azul gulped again. \"Because it's you I want, Azul. Not Rocky, you.\" \"Oh, Ginger. I want you too. I think about you most of the time. I could even come close to saying that – yes, I love you. I love you, Ginger!\" Oh, how I wish that would happen, Azul thought bitterly. The last two sentences had played out into his mind like a masterpiece on paper. The perfect love story. Often he found himself retreating into his own fantasies to gain his desires. His dreams didn't help either. Sailing across water...reaching the shore, and seeing Ginger's smile. The same shore that I left Strega behind. He sighed. \"What brings you out here, Ginger?\" \"Well, actually,\" Ginger began, \"It was about -- \" But she was stopped by the sound of Rocky's gasps, as he pulled himself up the rest of the hill. He flopped down and glared at her, exhaling deeply. \"Y'know, that was the most uncomfortable thing that's happened to me,\" he said, brushing loose grass strands from his comb. \"Really.\" Ginger eyed him, pulling twigs from his feathers. \"You wait until tonight then,\" she laughed. \"You won't know what's hit you.\" Rocky chuckled in embarrassment. Azul felt himself coiling in repulse. He stood up shakily, buying time. Distracting himself. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a group of chicks building a fort out of dry grass. Fowler pacing along the lines like a general, eyeing suspicious behaviour. Bunty napping. Babs pushing Susie too high on the swing. Susie squealing to get down. \"Tease,\" he heard Rocky whisper. \"You're almost as good as I am.\" \"I've got to go,\" Azul mumbled, jolting. This made Ginger turn. \"But – Azul, I was just going to tell you that Rocky wants -- \" \" – You,\" finished Azul. \"It's fine. I understand. If you two want to catch up and spend some time together, it's fine by me. Really, it's fine.\" His voice sounded more cheerful than expected. He brushed a feather under his beak, banishing a sniff, and turned to leave. \"Wait.\" Ginger took hold of his wing. \"Azul,\" and here he sighed at the way she said his name, \"That's not the reason we came up here. Rocky wanted to talk to you. We weren't telling you to leave, or whatever it was you were thinking. It will only be a few minutes. Please.\" But it's you I want to talk to, Ginger. Not Rocky. I just can't get you alone. \"Maybe later,\" said Azul. \"I've...got the raft to work on.\" \"Azul, please -- \" The rooster picked up the rest of his discarded tools, and dragged his raft limply down the hill. Anger burned through him like blood through his veins. What was her game? Was she flirting in front of him on purpose? Or was she trying to prove something? She is so confusing. So bloody complex all the time. I just wish I knew where she was coming from. He dropped one tool halfway down, and groaned in exasperation. There was a slight tension building up behind his eyes. The heat. He would blame it on that. Even if there was a lovely cool shade shadowing over everyone, and not a speck of sunlight to be seen. I'll just blame it on something that doesn't exist anymore. I'm good at that. \"Uph!\" he cried out, catching his foot in a tight ditch and falling over sideways. Great job, old boy. Juuuust great. He thumped the ground in his anger and inspected his foot. It wasn't too bad, not even twisted. Blood filled his face as he felt ashamed of himself. Looking up he saw Rocky and Ginger peering down at him. \"Hey, buddy! You ok?\" Rocky called. \"Yes, yes, don't bother!\" Azul answered, moving to get up. There was a tingling in his toes and his foot felt numb, but he didn't want to say so. The raft was still in perfect shape. How ironic. \"Hold on!\" came the voice again. Leave me alone, Yank. You've already taken Ginger as well as my pride. Before he had any time to move, Azul felt Rocky's wings around his shoulders, helping him up. The support was grateful, though he didn't feel it was at all necessary. \"I already said, you don't have to -- \" \"I'm offering, ain't I? You fell down pretty fast there. Sure you're not hurt?\" The kindness in Rocky's voice only made Azul feel worse. He turned away, not wanting to look into the rooster's eyes. What an idiot he felt! Thinking back on the excuses he made to leave so suddenly made everything sound childish. The things they were saying... It made him feel empty inside. What do I feel at the moment? Everything's so muddled. \"I'm fine,\" he told Rocky. \"Nothing's broken, or sprained, or twisted, or...whatever.\" Rocky sensed the tone in his voice and tightened his grip on his shoulder. \"I wasn't getting at ya, pal. In fact, that was the last thing on my mind.\" He sighed, running one of his wings through his comb. \"Ginger was trying to say so before – before you cut her off, that is -- \" Azul blushed again. \"Anyway, I've been looking for ya all day,\" Rocky finished. \"I've wanted to split words but you always seem to be hiding away, and sneaking off!\" He laughed. \"It's like you're trying to avoid me, or something.\" Don't you know it. \"Of course not,\" Azul spluttered. \"Why would I want to – why would I do that? I don't know why you would want to see me anyway. We haven't exactly had the most comfortable time getting to know each other. I don't even know anything about you.\" He turned to leave here, but Rocky held him fast. \"There's your problem, ya don't wanna hang around enough to know me. It's like your always looking for an excuse to run away from everyone.\" \"That's not true!\" Azul cried. \"Yeah? Well, go on then.\" \"What?\" \"Ask me a question. Go on, anything ya want. Anything ya wanna know.\" Azul stopped, cut off for words. Ridiculous, just plain ridiculous. He felt as if he were arguing with a child. What could Ginger possibly see in this immature excuse for a rooster? It seemed as though he was always looking to pick fights or faults. It filled Azul up with a red hot rage. \"Why?\" he asked slowly. \"So we can get to know each other,\" Rocky simply replied. But I don't want to get to know you. Azul, although wanting to be on good terms with Rocky, really wasn't in the mood to become sharing partners. Right now, all he wanted was to be left alone, so that he could plan his next move. He'd had a few close escapes with his raft, already with Babs and now with Rocky and Ginger. Ginger. God, now he felt like a fool again! \" But – Azul, I was just going to tell you that Rocky wants -- \" \" – You.\" What was he thinking? Shooting his big mouth off – He searched for words. \"Maybe now isn't the best time,\" he started. Rocky laughed incredulously. \"What makes you say that! In your case, it's not a 'best time' for anything! You're like the little 'duck n' cover', never wanting any contact from anyone unless they're asking about your life!\" \"I don't have to listen to this nonsense,\" Azul snapped, after a short silence. A vein in his head was beginning to pulse hard. Blow Rocky and his uselessness! Who was he to classify his character? He had no right to speak of him like this as if he knew him! Rocky rushed forward and grabbed hold of him again, impatience swelling. \"Look, it's not nonsense; you just wish it were, that's all! Are you gonna walk away from me every time I try to get chummy with ya? I'm just being friendly, pal. Ginger reckons I owe it to ya after the way I acted when you came. Now I'm wondering why,\" he added, releasing him. Azul felt coldness in his bones. Ginger? She wanted Rocky to do this? Questions spun around him. \"I don't want any favours,\" he said quietly. \"It's not a favour. I already feel bad about before, how many times do I have to say so?\" There was a long, annoying pause between them. Azul looked at the ground. \"There was...something I wanted to say,\" he said. \"Huh? What's that?\" Rocky asked, expecting another confrontation. He couldn't get his head around this guy more than he could get it around Ginger. They were both so complicated that at times he felt like screaming. I never know what the hell they want. \"It's just...Strega,\" Azul mumbled. \"Seeing you, and Ginger...it makes me - \" \"Jealous?\" Rocky finished. Azul paused. Was that how to describe it? It didn't really feel as though he was jealous of what went on between the two of them, it was more like he wanted Ginger and not the compassion. That was it. He was jealous, but of her being with someone else instead of him. But I thought I'd love Strega forever. He found that he could only nod as a reply. \"Well – hey, we'll just watch the smoochin' when you're close!\" Rocky replied, cheerfully. \"Why didn't you say so? I forgot that you're probably still hurting. It wasn't that long ago.\" Now Azul didn't know whether he felt better. In his opinion, if Ginger was with Rocky he still wanted to know what went on while he pretended not to look, but then again...ah, things were getting worse! There was nothing more that he wished than to tell Ginger how he really felt. The feeling he had for her was different to the one he had with Strega, he thought he was in love with her; but now he was unsure. He smiled. \"Thanks, Rocky.\" \"It's no problem, pal. C'mon.\" His wing was put around his shoulder as he helped him limp back to his hut. Not another word was said between them, and Azul was grateful for it. \"Azul!\" he heard a voice call out in the distance. He turned. Babs was waving at him. He smiled, and waved back. : To be continued : :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: (A/N: Please read and review! You can bash me about my lateness if you want! ...)","LastChapter":"Maybe Friends (A/N: I return to you again, after what feels like a lifetime of despair! I'm so sorry, guys, if you only knew what I've been going through all of this time you would understand, but now I make it all up to you with a chapter. I hope you all forgive me: deals out all of the brownies, shrooms and chocolate drops she can find :) :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-: \"Stupid, stupid, stupid...you are so, stupid... \" Thick clouds blocked out the afternoon heat as they folded over the sky. They sheltered Azul carefully, hiding him away in the shade. Even in the cool he felt sweat running down his forehead, as he tugged lazily at the rope around the joints on his raft. He grit his teeth, thinking: Nerves, nerves! That's all it is! What else could it be, I'm not doing any flippin' work to get me sweating! He wiped away at his head with the back of his wing, and shot a glance over his shoulder. He couldn't keep up this game for long – too soon he would be discovered and then the whole suspicion would be afoot. Azul, their brave, sensitive hero would be nothing more than a smudge on the cover of their weekly magazine. He hadn't been a liar, no, no! Far too harsh a word – too harsh. Besides...he could never create someone like Strega and pretend that she was a fiction in his brain. He tossed his tool down into the grass. Strega! It was all her fault he was here. She drove him away, unwanted. Turned him off like a slap in an argument, and he was still recovering from the after burn. He had come all of this way to get as far away from her as he could. Staying there, seeing her everyday and hearing her tinkle of a laugh would eventually bring him to madness. He wanted to get even somehow, make her hurt... show her how it really felt to have the heart ripped out of his chest. \"Gak, Strega!\" he said, angrily. \"I hate you.\" Tears stung his eyes. \"I hate you, I hate you, I hate you,\" he growled. He pulled tight on the rope, pulling and pulling until every pore in his body screamed for breath. He used it as a stress relief, to force all of the anger out of his system. He never used to do it that often, come to think of it... Strega... He stopped, panting, fully washed of his rage. Guilt coursed through him. Dear, sweet, Strega...how could I think those things? How could I say those things? She's my angel, my first love, my everything – and she hates me, it's my fault it all happened, she's not the one to blame... \"No,\" he whispered, dropping his wings. \"No, I'm sorry...I didn't mean it. It's my fault. My fault. Blame me!\" He numbly reached out and picked up his tool. \"I don't hate you, I don't!\" he cried. \"I don't hate you.\" Who am I talking to? She's not here. \"I'm hoping that's a good start,\" came Rocky's laugh from behind him. Fool! Azul abruptly spun around. Rocky and Ginger stood there, watching him with careful eyes. Ginger's especially were filled with confusion. She stood a little bit out in front, a subtle frown crossing her eyes and her foot tapping (as it always did when she was concerned about something). Rocky seemed more at focus with looking for glimpses of sunshine at the moment. \"Roc – Ginger!\" Azul spluttered. Ginger stared, softness in her voice. \"What are you doing?\" \"Do – doing... ?\" Azul pushed large layers of grass around his raft, surrounding it. He felt his cheeks flame up in embarrassment, and hoped he wasn't turning red. Mentally he pounded himself for being such a delinquent. The tool was hidden behind his back. \"Why, nothing!\" he gulped. \"You sure?\" Rocky finally asked him. He laughed to himself heartily at Azul's expression. It certainly didn't look too well at all. Pale, and clammy...his eyes wouldn't stop staring open. \"Looks like you're chokin' on a bug!\" Rocky chuckled. Ginger groaned to herself and gave him a shove, causing loss of balance and sending him on a roll down the nearest hill. \" Whoa! Boy !\" Azul held back a laugh, removing his grin when Ginger turned back to him. \"I've been meaning to do that for a while,\" she joked. Azul gulped again. \"Because it's you I want, Azul. Not Rocky, you.\" \"Oh, Ginger. I want you too. I think about you most of the time. I could even come close to saying that – yes, I love you. I love you, Ginger!\" Oh, how I wish that would happen, Azul thought bitterly. The last two sentences had played out into his mind like a masterpiece on paper. The perfect love story. Often he found himself retreating into his own fantasies to gain his desires. His dreams didn't help either. Sailing across water...reaching the shore, and seeing Ginger's smile. The same shore that I left Strega behind. He sighed. \"What brings you out here, Ginger?\" \"Well, actually,\" Ginger began, \"It was about -- \" But she was stopped by the sound of Rocky's gasps, as he pulled himself up the rest of the hill. He flopped down and glared at her, exhaling deeply. \"Y'know, that was the most uncomfortable thing that's happened to me,\" he said, brushing loose grass strands from his comb. \"Really.\" Ginger eyed him, pulling twigs from his feathers. \"You wait until tonight then,\" she laughed. \"You won't know what's hit you.\" Rocky chuckled in embarrassment. Azul felt himself coiling in repulse. He stood up shakily, buying time. Distracting himself. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a group of chicks building a fort out of dry grass. Fowler pacing along the lines like a general, eyeing suspicious behaviour. Bunty napping. Babs pushing Susie too high on the swing. Susie squealing to get down. \"Tease,\" he heard Rocky whisper. \"You're almost as good as I am.\" \"I've got to go,\" Azul mumbled, jolting. This made Ginger turn. \"But – Azul, I was just going to tell you that Rocky wants -- \" \" – You,\" finished Azul. \"It's fine. I understand. If you two want to catch up and spend some time together, it's fine by me. Really, it's fine.\" His voice sounded more cheerful than expected. He brushed a feather under his beak, banishing a sniff, and turned to leave. \"Wait.\" Ginger took hold of his wing. \"Azul,\" and here he sighed at the way she said his name, \"That's not the reason we came up here. Rocky wanted to talk to you. We weren't telling you to leave, or whatever it was you were thinking. It will only be a few minutes. Please.\" But it's you I want to talk to, Ginger. Not Rocky. I just can't get you alone. \"Maybe later,\" said Azul. \"I've...got the raft to work on.\" \"Azul, please -- \" The rooster picked up the rest of his discarded tools, and dragged his raft limply down the hill. Anger burned through him like blood through his veins. What was her game? Was she flirting in front of him on purpose? Or was she trying to prove something? She is so confusing. So bloody complex all the time. I just wish I knew where she was coming from. He dropped one tool halfway down, and groaned in exasperation. There was a slight tension building up behind his eyes. The heat. He would blame it on that. Even if there was a lovely cool shade shadowing over everyone, and not a speck of sunlight to be seen. I'll just blame it on something that doesn't exist anymore. I'm good at that. \"Uph!\" he cried out, catching his foot in a tight ditch and falling over sideways. Great job, old boy. Juuuust great. He thumped the ground in his anger and inspected his foot. It wasn't too bad, not even twisted. Blood filled his face as he felt ashamed of himself. Looking up he saw Rocky and Ginger peering down at him. \"Hey, buddy! You ok?\" Rocky called. \"Yes, yes, don't bother!\" Azul answered, moving to get up. There was a tingling in his toes and his foot felt numb, but he didn't want to say so. The raft was still in perfect shape. How ironic. \"Hold on!\" came the voice again. Leave me alone, Yank. You've already taken Ginger as well as my pride. Before he had any time to move, Azul felt Rocky's wings around his shoulders, helping him up. The support was grateful, though he didn't feel it was at all necessary. \"I already said, you don't have to -- \" \"I'm offering, ain't I? You fell down pretty fast there. Sure you're not hurt?\" The kindness in Rocky's voice only made Azul feel worse. He turned away, not wanting to look into the rooster's eyes. What an idiot he felt! Thinking back on the excuses he made to leave so suddenly made everything sound childish. The things they were saying... It made him feel empty inside. What do I feel at the moment? Everything's so muddled. \"I'm fine,\" he told Rocky. \"Nothing's broken, or sprained, or twisted, or...whatever.\" Rocky sensed the tone in his voice and tightened his grip on his shoulder. \"I wasn't getting at ya, pal.

Author's Notes: Okay, I wanted to try my hand at writing something up for this movie because I thought I always saw a flicker of something between these two characters if things were just twisted a little bit…I might stick to the storyline for the main points of the story, but I'm going to change and edit things along the way to suit my own fancy. Anyway, this is the first bit of it to see how everyone reacts…Please let me know what you think. Torrance Shipman had been completely in awe when Missy Pantone had finished her audition. Sure, she had thought that there had to be someone better than Whitney's little sister, but she wasn't expecting miracles. Missy was a very welcome miracle. Well, she was a miracle until she took off during the middle of the cheer. She had been watching calmly in the stands, and then she was gone. Gone. Courtney and Whitney had scoffed at her, of course, when the blonde had run off outside following Missy. Missy looked ready to beat her up, until something clicked. The blonde really didn't know what was going on. A few hours later, she was enlightened, and ready for a new cheer. They had to make a new cheer, because the Clovers were going to be doing the exact same cheer as them at nationals unless they fixed it somehow. \"Fuck,\" Missy screamed. \"We so almost got our asses kicked back there!\" Torrance rolled her eyes, not replying. \"Something wrong?\" The brunette took her eyes off the road for a second to glance at her. \"We need a new cheer,\" was Torrance's new answer. \"So?\" Missy shrugged nonchalantly as she continued driving. It wasn't that big of a deal. In gymnastics, she liked to work on her own routines; cheerleading couldn't be that bad. Well, minus the yelling part. That part was easy though. \"You'll make a new cheer.\" That was Missy's brilliant suggestion. She could write a new cheer. Torrance shook her head before realizing that the brunette was driving and looking at the road again, so she couldn't see her. \"No,\" she replied. \"I've never written one. It's always been Big Red who has written the cheers.\" \"Or stolen the cheers,\" Missy added helpfully. A quick glare from Torrance silenced her because she could sense it even from the driver's side. A quick glance at the blonde proved her theory true. She was getting the death glare. So, she tried a new approach. \"Cheerleading isn't everything.\" \"It is for me,\" Torrance replied quietly and she glanced at the window. \"I'm only cheerleading.\" Missy felt a sharp pain in her chest and looked at the other girl. Her face was turned towards the window, but there was a chance that the blonde was crying. Missy had no idea what to do with crying girls, so she had to make it stop. They were like a weakness, she just instantly wanted them to feel better…Especially if they were pretty girls, which Torrance definitely was. She didn't want to be the sappy one there, but she also didn't want to deal with crying girls. \"We'll write a new cheer.\" The blonde looked at her, suddenly hopeful, and Missy tried to steal a glance to see if she had been crying. She hadn't. Crap. Missy had offered her services and basically promised to be a full-time cheerleader, and here there wasn't even a crying girl to be the reason for it. She was going to regret it later. \"We?\" The blonde echoed questioningly. Missy was tempted to correct herself and say that Torrance heard wrong, but she merely shrugged. \"Yeah, we.\" The blonde's smile was enigmatic, and Missy found herself smiling a bit herself as she drove them back home. They were quiet and thinking until they reached Torrance's house, which, of course, Torrance gave her directions to. They had their own thoughts to be dwelling on. Torrance was back in head cheerleader mood, trying to think of ideas for new cheers. It was something new to her, and she didn't want to screw up again in front of the squad again. Missy was pondering on something completely different. She was trying to figure out the sexuality of the cheerleader sitting next to her. Everything flashed straight from the blonde. Perfectly straight. Missy knew that she set off gaydar detectors even in straight people sometimes due to her inability to back down from fights, and her love of drawing tattoos on herself during class. Then again, it could be her chain wallet…Either way, it seemed like people had known that she liked girls before she even knew it herself. Of course, she didn't realize what it meant to be gay for quite a while. She thought that thinking girls were 'cool' was normal and all girls did it…until she realized that most girls were thinking the same thoughts she did about girls, only they were thinking them about boys. Since then, she admitted to herself that she was gay, but although most people wondered about her, she didn't fill them in on that little detail unless they asked her specifically. She glanced at the super-straight blonde next to her, and she sighed a little as she parked where Torrance directed her to do so. Now was no time to get a crush…especially not on someone who was straight. \"Thank you for showing me that, Missy.\" Torrance was starring at her hard enough to make the brunette come out of her stupor. She shrugged. \"I just thought that you should know.\" There was another smile from the perky blonde. \"Do you know anyone else that would have known about what Big Red was doing?\" The blonde shook her head in a silent 'no.' \"What about someone who might have ideas for the cheer?\" She was thinking of the squad when she asked that question; she wasn't thinking that hanging around a few other girls might get her mind off of the cute blonde, who she didn't even know that well at that. Torrance thought for a moment, her lips pursed in silence. \"Aaron might have some ideas.\" \"Erin?\" Missy quirked one eyebrow, wondering who she was. She wasn't on the squad. \"My boyfriend. He graduated last year.\" Boyfriend. Torrance was into guys for sure. Sure, Missy had figured…but it still hurt to realize that she had a boyfriend. Crap. Missy was falling for a girl she had only known for a couple of days. \"Ah,\" Missy nodded like she knew what she was talking about, then she paused. \"Wait. Was he a cheerleader?\" Torrance nodded, and Missy stopped herself from making a joke about guys being cheerleaders and being gay…Torrance rolled her eyes at her new friend. \"I know what you're thinking. He's not gay!\" The blonde looked at her incredulously. Everyone just had to make that joke, didn't they? Missy shrugged, \"Cheerleaders can be gay.\" That was her simple and 'witty' reply. She silently cursed herself for not thinking of anything better. Torrance quirked her own eyebrow this time. \"What like you?\" Missy froze, afraid that she was caught already, and Torrance giggled before stepping out of the car. Oh, she was kidding. Missy finally caught on, and forced a smile herself. Torrance shook her blonde hair giggling at the look on Missy's face before going back into her own house.[Chapter 2] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably only PG, due to some language.

Summary: This will be a Torrance/Missy story eventually…Just give it some time, and the other characters of the movie will be in here too, of course. Author's Notes: Thank you for the reviews I got…I really do appreciate it. Missy had just gotten home, when Cliff wandered down the stairs. \"Hey Sis,\" he stated casually. There was a glint to his eye, and Missy could tell that something else was on his mind. \"What do you want, Cliff?\" She pulled an apple out of a bowl sitting on the counter and looked at it skeptically. It appeared decent, and so she took a bite. She could multi-task. Cliff never had anything really important to tell her anyway. \"Who said I wanted anything?\" Missy rolled her eyes at her brother, and he shrugged. \"Okay okay. You know, Torrance? That blonde cheerleader?\" He looked at Missy hopefully. \"No,\" Missy swallowed a piece of apple and shrugged for good measure. \"What? You know the one that was here the other day.\" He wasn't quite sure how anyone could forget Torrance so easily. She was so beautiful, and she seemed witty. Though, she didn't know music very well, at least not his music. \"I know who you mean, dumb ass. I was kidding. It's called sarcasm.\" She took another bite of her apple, and leaned against the counter. \"Ah. My sister. So witty.\" Cliff nodded knowingly and crossed his arms. \"Seriously though, were you with her?\" \"Yes,\" Missy shrugged nonchalantly, like it was no big deal, but it was a big deal. She wasn't sure why he would be asking about Torrance unless… \"Think she'd date me?\" Unless he liked her. \"What?\" Missy tried to not choke on her apple as she stared at him. She couldn't picture the two of them together. Torrance was into cheerleading, really into cheerleading, and Cliff had never gone to a football game. Plus, she was sure that Cliff did not listen to the same music as Torrance. \"Do you think she would date me? I know it's a hard concept for you to grasp.\" He rolled his eyes again, pretending that his sister was dumb, and secretly hoping that she would get annoyed enough to tell him the answers to his questions. \"No, she's gay.\" Missy was surprised at how easily the lie flowed from her mouth. She could have just said that Torrance had a boyfriend, but she didn't. She didn't want to. She was still hopeful. \"Really?\" Cliff raised his eyebrows in surprise. \"Maybe,\" Missy shrugged. She felt a little bit bad about lying about Torrance's sexuality…Not that she knew her sexuality for sure. As far as Missy knew, Torrance could be bisexual, if Missy was lucky anyway. \"You like her!\" Cliff knew his sister better than either would want to admit, and he knew when she liked someone. It was easy to see because she suddenly became interested in new things. Like cheerleading. Plus, that's when she began to eat healthy for some reason. He double-checked Missy's hand. She had an apple. \"What? No.\" Missy shook her head and swallowed quickly, and put the apple core behind her back into the bowl again. She'd have to remember to take that out later. \"You like her, and she's straight.\" Cliff grinned again, thinking he had figured it out. That's why Missy had lied. She liked her, and he was right, of course, Torrance was straight. Maybe she really did like him…Then, he noticed the glare he was receiving from his sister and smirked. \"Aw, don't worry, Sis. We'll find you a nice girl yet.\" Missy glared at him as he climbed back up the stairs trying to think of a good way to pick up a conversation with Torrance again the next time he saw her. One good joke was all he needed, one more good line, and then he could ask her out. Missy had gone to sleep soon after her conversation with Cliff simply because she hadn't felt that great afterward. She just wanted to sleep, so that's what she did. So, it made since when she was grumpy the next morning when the phone rang. It was Saturday after all. \"Hello?\" She answered it groggily, the anger seeping into the phone line slightly. \"Hey Missy.\" Whoever was calling the brunette was awfully perky in the morning… \"It's early,\" Missy groaned. She glanced at the clock before dropping it on the floor in frustration. \"It's seven.\" That's when the voice connected to Missy's memory bank. It was Torrance. \"Exactly. Did you not just hear me say it's early?\" Missy was awake now, but she still didn't like getting up earlier than she had to. \"Well, you have ten minutes to get ready.\" Torrance was straight to the point, hoping that it would wake the other girl up more. Through the phone line, it wasn't hard to tell that she had woken the brunette up. \"Ten minutes?\" Missy questioned. \"Your first weekend practice. I'll come get you.\" Practice. Cheerleading. It clicked in Missy's mind and suddenly her thoughts flashed back to her. She had promised to be a cheerleader.[Chapter 3] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably only PG, due to some language and slight sexual content.

Missy blinked sleepily even as she sat in the car with blonde morning person. Torrance was already wide awake, and Missy was trying to figure out how to deal with it, but before the thought crossed her mind twice, Torrance was talking. \"We're here, sleepyhead!\" Missy had become more awake on the way to school, thankfully, because the rest of the squad was already standing around on the grass looking bored and grouchy themselves, well, except for Les. \"Off to do captain stuff?\" Missy posed the question, and Torrance nodded with a smirk. \"Hey Les,\" Missy murmured as she wandered over towards one of the other members of the squad she actually knew and got along with. \"How are you on this fine morning?\" \"You're not a morning person either are you?\" Les squinted up at her from his seat on the ground. \"That'd be a no,\" Missy continued as she plopped herself on the ground next to Les. Eventually, Torrance stopped talking to Courtney and Whitney about the fact that Missy was on the squad no matter what now, not Whitney's little sister who didn't seem to care one way or the other. She simply looked bored, and like she should go home and sleep. So, Whitney left in a huff to do that, and Torrance started the stretchesIt was all individual stretches at first, and then Torrance announced that the next few stretches would require a partner.Missy glanced over at Les who shrugged. \"Sure, usually I'm with Whitney, but she's not back yet.\" But, it seemed as if those words brought her back, without her sister this time. \"Sorry Missy,\" Les muttered rolling his eyes as Whitney stormed back towards practice. \"Uh-uh. He's my stretching partner.\" Whitney glared at Missy who laughed. \"Whatever works for Miss Princess. Whitney, tell me, is it that you have to be his partner because the person you really like is over there stretching with someone that's not you?\" Whitney glanced in the direction that Missy was pointing. Courtney was stretching with Jan. \"Are you saying I like Jan? Puh-lease.\" Whitney rolled her eyes dramatically at the idea. \"I didn't mean Jan.\" Whitney glanced to her right again. Courtney was still stretching with Jan. \"You meant…\" Whitney trailed off, and her eyes flashed in anger. How dare the new girl accuse her of liking her best friend like that! She was saying that she was into girls. She folded her arms across her chest protectively, and Les tried not to laugh as something resembling a growl came from the girl's throat. \"I'm calling you a lesbian,\" Missy was happy to clarify because Whitney had never finished asking her question. \"I know what you were calling me!\" Whitney didn't deny the charges, which made Missy quirk an eyebrow questioningly. \"What are you guys doing?\" Torrance wandered over to their group. They were the only four not stretching. The head cheerleader always got the person that didn't have a stretching partner, and Torrance was wondering which one of the three it was. Whitney was still glaring at Missy, and Missy was smirking as she realized some new information about Whitney and Courtney. Les just seemed to find something entertaining. \"Okay, Missy, come with me.\" Missy was ready to complain. \"Hey, I didn't even do anything!\" She stated this as Les and Whitney started into the stretches, and the two girls were a safe distance away from the other stretching pairs. \"Where are we going?\" The brunette glanced around, and she realized that they were the only ones not stretching. Something clicked in her mind. \"We're stretching,\" Torrance chuckled as a look of surprise flashed on the brunette's face before she quickly tried to hide it. The brunette cleared her throat and nodded. She knew that's what they were going to do. Really. Torrance didn't believe her, but started into the stretch anyway. \"What are we supposed to do?\" The blonde started to open her mouth, but she was interrupted. \"Don't say that we're supposed to stretch.\" \"Okay, you're going to help me stretch my legs.\" Missy was used to stretching. She did it when she was in gymnastics, but she wasn't used to doing them with someone that she was attracted to. She shrugged like it was no big deal, and watched as Torrance began to lie down on her back. \"You have to get on the ground too.\" Missy looked at the other pairs to see what kinds of stretching they were doing. One of them would lie on the ground lift her leg into the air, and the other would let the leg lie on his/her shoulder as he/she gently would stretch the hamstring, and pressing closer towards the torso of the one lying on the ground. It looked like some kind of clothed exercise porno if Missy let herself think about it too much, but she didn't. \"Right,\" she mumbled as the blonde shifted her leg onto her shoulder. A moment later, Missy was gently pressing herself forward and she begged her mind to stay on track. Missy had to bite her lip to keep herself from rushing forward and kissing the blonde. She tried to blame the position they were in, and she tried to keep a steady state of mind. She should really say something witty. Anything. Torrance closed her eyes as the kinks in her hamstrings began to relax. \"Harder,\" she said gently. The pressure of the brunette increased slightly, and the brunette was rather close to Torrance's body now. Neither one of the girls expected it when after one particular movement forward, the closeness and the pressure of the two bodies made Torrance moan. They were far enough away that the other pairs didn't hear the noise, but the brunette immediately picked up on it. She paused for a moment before pressing forward again; she couldn't have heard what she had thought. Then, after another two motions, the moan was heard again. This time it was slightly louder. It was loud enough that Missy knew it wasn't a moan of pain, but it had to be sexual. She started to open her mouth, but the blonde opened her eyes and began talking. \"Okay, enough with the stretching. We're moving onto our new routine.\" Missy couldn't do anything but help the blonde stand up. \"Yes, new routine everyone.\" Whitney and Courtney immediately began to belittle the idea, and so Missy took the chance to go talk to Les. \"So,\" she began quietly, not wanting to interrupt Torrance. \"the question of the day…\" She planned to ask Les if he knew of Torrance maybe being bisexual, but he had his own question. \"Is what the hell you're going to do about your partner's little moaning problem during exercises?\" Missy smirked for a moment, realizing that she had made Torrance do that, then an unsettling thought came over her; maybe the second moan wasn't as quiet as Missy thought. Shit.[Chapter 4] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably only PG, maybe PG-13, there is some language. Disclaimer: None of these characters are mine. I can't claim them (unfortunately for me). They all belong to hardworking people involved with the movie 'Bring it On.' Feedback: Yes please, I really want to know what everyone thinks of this. Summary: This will be a Torrance/Missy story eventually…Just give it some time, and the other characters of the movie will be in here too, of course. Author's Notes: Thank you to everyone who reviews. I really appreciate it, and it entices me to write some more to the story…This is the next bit with the sexual orientation talk in the car, with a twist. Enjoy. \"That was not fair,\" Missy began as she sauntered over to Torrance's car and hopped in the passenger seat, ready for her ride home after practice. \"They have no idea what they're getting into by not changing the routine.\" \"I know,\" Torrance sighed and glanced at the brunette. The blonde was exhausted, but she had no chance except go on with what the squad decided. In the end, very few people voted to change the routine. Torrance, Les, and Missy being a few exceptions. \"You know, it was great today.\" Torrance turned and looked at Missy, confused for a moment as to what the other girl was referring to. \"Practice. First real practice that I've attended and stayed for, you know?\" The brunette continued on, and the blonde's confusion went away from her eyes. Missy smirked happily to herself realizing that Torrance's mind went to the exercises as well, when the brunette brought up 'being great.' But, the blonde ignored any opportunity she had to bring it up. In fact, she ignored it as well as she could. \"I'll pick you up tonight,\" Torrance continued. \"Les, Jan, and I will come get you tonight. It's always horrible trying to find a parking spot at a game, much less trying to have everyone on the squad trying to find a good parking place…It's easier if groups of us go together.\" Missy thought about it for a second, and she ignored all urges in her screaming to make a 'pick-up line' joke. \"Okay, tonight then.\" She nodded for a second as if confirming something in her mind. \"I promise to be extra peppy and extra cheery.\" Missy held up her hands and grinned, swaying her hands in front of her to try to give herself the extra cheery bit. Torrance laughed at the expression on the brunette's face. \"I wouldn't miss that for the world.\" Missy quirked an eyebrow at her new friend as they pulled up in front of her house. \"You better not. You're my ride. Besides, if you forget to pick me up…You're going to have to listen to my own pick-up line.\" She smirked at her joke, even if it was a bit corny. The blonde rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, yeah. Just get out now.\" She was smiling, which was a plus after the hazardous practice and vote they had suffered through. It was a few hours later, and Missy had showered and changed into her cheerleading out. \"Look Sis! You're a cheerleader!\" Really. Sometimes her brother had such wit. Missy rolled her eyes at his stupidity. \"And I'm the one who's going to be with Torrance all night?\" Missy wiggled her eyebrows, and laughed at her brother's baffled expression. \"Wanna bet?\" He finally had his comeback and smirked as he leaned against the kitchen counter. \"No. Betting is for stupid guys who think they will win the girl that way.\" Missy rolled her eyes at her brother. All guys seemed to think that a bet would make everything better between themselves and a girl. \"Hint. The girl always ends up mad.\" Missy nodded sarcastically at him once more, before a horn was heard honking outside. \"That's them. I've got to go.\" \"Maybe I can get a ride with them.\" Cliff suggested this as he noticed his sister in the doorway modeling her cheerleading outfit for the people in the car. She was wiggling her hips to side to side as the people in the car whistled and made comments at her. \"Sexy!\" He picked out the lone girl's voice. It was Torrance, and she was calling his sister sexy. Cliff couldn't let her just leave like that, so he had to be the good brother and walk outside with her. He ran over to the car just as she was getting settled into the backseat next to Jan. Les was driving, and Torrance was settled into the passenger seat up front. \"Hey,\" he leaned up against the car for a second before opening the backseat. \"I'm ready for a game!\" He grinned, and Torrance chuckled a bit. The guys looked slightly irritated, and Missy looked pissed, but nonetheless, Missy and Jan scooted closer together so that Jan was in the middle and Cliff and Missy on either side. The conversation continued on even with Cliff there, though. \"So, you ladies will just have to grin and bear it. We have to defend our sexualities.\" Cliff had zoned out for a few minutes because talks of football and cheerleading didn't do much for him, but he tuned back in when the talk of sexuality was brought up by Les. Missy thought for a second before asking her next question. \"What are your sexualities?\" She looked at them both individually. \"Well, Jan's straight, while I'm controversial.\" Les flipped Missy a grin in the rearview mirror. \"I'm straight,\" Cliff clarified. Missy gave him an odd look. \"What? All the other guys had to say their sexualities…I figured that I should too.\" He shrugged, and Missy rolled her eyes at her brother. The guys didn't say much, and Torrance laughed a little, though even she, sounded a little bit forced. \"And the girls are off the hook about saying theirs?\" Cliff looked confused as he looked from his sister to Torrance. He really wanted to know what Torrance would list as hers. Well, he also wanted to hear his sister stagger through her answer as she told the others. \"My brother, the jackass.\" Missy sighed realizing that that was not the way to approach the subject of sexuality with anyone who was nervous about it, especially if they didn't want to announce it to the whole group at once. Torrance smiled slightly as she looked out the window. Torrance looked oddly uncomfortable as she looked out the window, so a subject change was obviously in need. \"We're here.\" Cliff announced lightly as they pulled into the parking lot. Okay, so strike one came when he asked the girl about her sexuality. No matter. He'd win her back. So, they all clamored out of the car. Cliff waved good-bye to them as he headed towards the bleachers, pulling out a book from his pocket as he did so, and the cheerleaders took off towards where they were to practice. Jan wandered off towards Courtney who was talking to an upset looking Whitney. Les wandered towards a couple of other people on the squad. \"So, um, what is your sexuality?\" The blonde glanced at Missy, as she asked her question. \"Um,\" Missy began her sentence, but then she stopped for a second. \"I'm gay.\" She glanced at Torrance for a moment, and she saw a flicker of some kind of emotion in her eyes. She wasn't sure, but the brunette would have sworn that it was the same look that Torrance had in her eyes when she first opened them during the exercises. Want. \"Does that freak you out?\" \"No!\" Torrance almost shouted it and a few people in the parking lot looked at them oddly. \"What do you think it is? When you go back to the sexuality question, I mean. What do you think I am?\" Missy looked perplexed and unsure of how to answer that question. She wasn't sure if she was allowed to suggest that Torrance might be anything other than straight. Torrance quirked an eyebrow at her. They still hadn't moved from the car even though everyone else had walked to where they were supposed to be. Then, she shrugged. \"I have a boyfriend.\" Missy waited for Torrance to explain more, to clarify, but she didn't. So, she moved on. Torrance would say what she wanted to, when she wanted to. She just hoped that she didn't freak her out with her confession. \"You just had to be early, huh?\" Missy glanced towards Torrance. \"Huh?\" Torrance looked surprised for a second. They had finally started moving towards the group to warm up. \"Oh. Right. To pick you up.\" She chuckled. \"You didn't get to use your pick-up line.\" \"Can I use it anyway?\" Missy suddenly looked like a slightly over-eager puppy, and Torrance couldn't help but laugh at her excitement. \"Sure, I see the cheeriness now anyway.\" Torrance laughed again, and she looked towards Missy. \"If I was a pirate, you'd be my treasure.\" Missy beamed at her line, and Torrance burst out laughing. \"What? I thought it was a good line.\" The brunette shrugged her shoulders. \"Be glad that I'm stuck with you all night or I might leave you after a line like that. Remember, you're staying over, right?\" Missy nodded, dumbstruck, as she watched Torrance walk over and start addressing the others, trying to fill them in on what cheers they would use that night. She could have sworn that as she walked away, Torrance's hips swung a little bit more than usual when she walked.[Chapter 5] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably PG.

Author's Notes: Thank you to everyone who sent feedback. I really appreciate it…and for once, I don't have too much to ramble on about before posting this. Enjoy. Missy looked at the other cheerleaders instantly regretting her decision to try to be one of them. Whitney was busy glaring at Courtney while she flirted with the crowd. Courtney was eyeing Jan while she did a few kicks, an extra little show for him. He wasn't displeased. Wes was doing some of the typical male cheerleader moves. He'd grin and throw his fist into the air screaming out, \"Go Toros,\" every now and then. The squad was doing a few simply cheers before the game, but they were mostly free-style cheering, trying to pump up the crowd and the football players. The brunette rolled her eyes because she was trying to figure out just what she had gotten herself into. Then, during the middle of one of the pointlessly simple cheers, she looked over at the blonde on her right. Torrance was looking at her too. Missy smirked, and Torrance rolled her eyes as the cheer finished. \"Come on! Be a real cheerleader!\" \"I'm not a real cheerleader.\" Missy pouted for a moment, looking at the other cheerleaders as they did their kicks and yelling. She stood there facing the blonde. \"So, do you often wear that sassy skirt for fun and frolic?\" Torrance tilted her head to the side, obviously feeling playful as she teased the brunette. \"Did you just use sassy and frolic in the same sentence?\" Missy tried to look horrified as she asked the blonde the question, but she ended up letting out a small smile. \"Yeah,\" Torrance grimaced. \"I think I did. Sorry. Forgive me, Miss Queen of All Things Not Cheerleading?\" Torrance mock-pleaded with the other girl until Missy grinned. \"I'll take that as a yes,\" she murmured before Missy gave in and gave a loud yell and a sharp kick with one of her legs. She was getting into it when Courtney and Whitney trapped Torrance in between them, one on either side. The football game had just officially started, but no one cared because they were all watching the cheerleaders anyway, including Cliff. \"What are you doing?\" Whitney whispered in horror, afraid that Torrance didn't know what she was getting herself into. \"What are you talking about?\" The head-cheerleader looked confused and shrugged. \"You're having cheer sex with her.\" Whitney pointed this out and pointed her finger towards a certain brunette cheerleader to show who she was talking about. Courtney batted Whitney's hand down as she realized that Missy was now looking at the three of them oddly. \"What? Her? Missy?\" Torrance tried to look baffled at such an idea. Her. Missy. Huh. \"We were talking.\" Torrance defended both of them, afraid of what would happen if Missy heard the conversation. \"Foreplay is more like it.\" Whitney crossed her arms across her chest stubbornly. There was no way that the two girls would get away with cheer-sex in front of her and Courtney. They had it perfected. \"Don't play dumb; we're better at it than you.\" Courtney nodded her head, agreeing with her best friend. \"Why would you? I mean, with her, the uber-dyke. You have Aaron.\" Courtney seemed completely confused as she talked about Aaron. She'd liked him for a while now. Male cheerleaders were just so yummy, at least if they were into girls. Torrance rolled her eyes, refusing to listen to the two girls state ridiculous accusations. She ignored them, and Whitney seemed to lose interest in the conversation once Aaron was brought up. \"And you have Jan.\" Courtney wheeled around to find Missy standing behind her. She obviously hadn't heard the whole conversation because she didn't look ready to beat anyone up. \"What? So?\" Courtney shrugged and looked at Jan. He smiled at her and gave her a thumbs up before winking. \"Oh, ew. That was an over-share.\" Missy looked disgusted and Jan realized that she saw what he had done. He quickly coughed and turned to talk to Les. The blonde girl simply grinned. \"What's your point? Have you decided to turn straight and you want your shot at him?\" \"What? No.\" The blonde's eyebrows rose in surprise. She didn't think the uber-dyke would admit to being into girls. \"I meant no to being into Jan. You can have that all you want.\" Missy shrugged her slim shoulders and looked away from Jan back towards Whitney for a moment, then back to Courtney. \"Stop screwing with the heads of other cheerleaders.\" She glanced back towards Whitney, and Courtney followed her glance. She blushed, but before she could say anything Missy was back in formation. Torrance seemed out of it. \"You okay, Tor?\" Missy asked her this as the football team missed another goal. The blonde shook her head. \"I don't think so. Look who's here.\" Missy glanced up and locked eyes with the members of the Clovers' squad. \"Maybe they're here to watch,\" Missy mumbled as the Toros started their cheer. To her and everyone else's horror, the Clovers matched the moves perfectly. It was time for a new cheer.[Chapter 6] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably only PG, due to some language. It may be raised to PG-13 in future chapters.

Summary: This will be a Torrance/Missy story eventually…Just give it some time, and the other characters of the movie will be in here too, of course. Author's Notes: Thank you to everyone who updates! And, I'm still trying to stick to the show, though some of the dialogue and actions are very obviously changed to suit my want ;) Enjoy. After a couple hours of absolute horror, the squad had finally agreed that there was need to change the routine. Actually, even the audience had agreed that the need to change the routine was pertinent. \"So, your parents won't mind that I'm staying here tonight?\" Torrance glanced warily over at Missy. \"Nah, they won't even notice.\" Missy grinned at the blonde, reassuring her. \"Though, there is one thing that anyone can notice…\" \"What? Something more about the squad? The cheer?\" Torrance was still in freak-out mode. Missy laughed. \"No, your breath.\" She grimaced over-dramatically. Torrance sniffed her breath herself, by breathing into her hand. \"Oh my God. You're right. Sorry…\" The brunette chuckled. \"The bathroom is down the hall, to the right.\" She pointed down towards the hallway, and Torrance took off, carting her toothbrush with her. While Torrance trotted towards the bathroom, Missy hastily looked around her room, trying to figure out what she had to clean up before Torrance got back. Luckily, she didn't find anything that she necessarily had to move. It was all fairly clean. Well, it was a fairly clean room once she shoved some clothes into her clothes hamper anyway. There. All good. It was then that she realized that Torrance wasn't back yet. She wondered briefly how long it took the blonde to brush her teeth, maybe she got lost. She wandered down the hall to find Torrance staring at her brother. \"What are you doing?\" The blonde jumped in surprise at hearing Missy's voice. Cliff grinned at her. \"Looking for the bathroom?\" Torrance asked meekly. \"Right there,\" Missy pointed at it, and the blonde stumbled into it, feeling embarrassed. Missy had caught Torrance staring at her brother. She had been hoping that if she looked at Cliff enough that something inside of her would feel something; she'd want him. The blonde was just so confused. She was really starting to like the brunette, but she had never fallen for someone so fast before. Torrance had never fallen for a girl before. It didn't make sense to her. What made sense would have been her falling for Cliff, a guy, even though she had a boyfriend. That was excusable, but was falling for a girl acceptable? \"She'll love me,\" Cliff whispered to his sister before grinning and striking a few more chords on his guitar. \"You wish,\" the girl muttered back to her brother, but in her mind she was just hoping that it wasn't the truth. She couldn't handle the truth if that's what it was. She didn't want to listen to him anymore, besides, he was pounding on his guitar again, apparently happy that he had won Torrance over for a few seconds with his guitar playing. Missy sniffed her own breath and frowned. She could brush her teeth again. So, she followed the hallway to the bathroom where Torrance was already. \"Hey,\" she mumbled as she pushed the door open. Torrance flashed a smile, but didn't speak because she still had the brush in her mouth. Missy got her own toothbrush out, and she put some toothpaste on it. She began brushing when she realized that Torrance had been brushing for a long time. Then, she cautiously spit into the sink, trying to hide it. The brunette grinned, and spit out some toothpaste herself. She raised an eyebrow at the blonde, and Torrance raised hers back. That was all it took for the two girls to continue brushing and smirking and flirting for a few minutes. Finally, Missy rinsed off her brush and smiled at the blonde, waiting for her to finish. \"All clean,\" the brunette announced as Torrance put her toothbrush down on the counter. \"Me too,\" Torrance agreed and looked over at the brunette. She was in her pajamas, and the blonde couldn't help but glance at her body. Missy noticed it and followed her eyes down. Torrance was checking her out! \"Are you checking me out?\" Missy couldn't help but ask the question, and Torrance immediately blushed. So, Missy hastened to fix it. \"Not that I mind…\"She rambled off embarrassed. Torrance could be straight. \"Yeah?\" Torrance bit her lip and looked at the other girl. The brunette nodded, and cautiously Torrance took a step closer to her. \"You don't mind this?\" Torrance asked as she put one hand on Missy's waist, effectively pulling her closer. Missy shook her head. Hell no, she didn't mind. \"You don't mind this?\" Torrance asked as she brought her face inches away from the brunette's. Missy was sure that she was dreaming, but she didn't care. Instead of answering, she brought her lips to the blonde's, kissing her. It took Torrance a moment, but then she was kissing her back. Torrance felt the want that she had been trying to feel while looking at Cliff, but she felt it as she kissed Missy, and she was sure that she shouldn't ignore it. So, she pushed herself closer to the brunette, effectively pinning her against the counter. The brunette raised her arms to Torrance, placing one on her back, and one on her neck. Torrance mumbled something incoherent, but it was probably an encouragement, because a moment later, the blonde's tongue had found its way into Missy's mouth, and a few seconds later the moment was over. \"We have to go to bed,\" Torrance mumbled quickly. She hadn't been planning on kissing Missy to see what she felt, but she had, and she didn't want to stop. That was bad. Very bad. She had a boyfriend. So, she was trying to be calm, and she was trying to not freak out. Missy was trying to let the blonde figure out her feelings without jumping her because if the blonde kept kissing her like that… Normally, Missy would have made a sexual joke, but instead she nodded humbly leading them both back towards her room. Cliff was still strumming on his guitar, but it was Missy who took the girl to bed. Unfortunately, it was also Missy who had to wake up to Torrance talking to Aaron on her cell phone.[Chapter 7] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably PG-13, due to language.

Summary: This will be a Torrance/Missy story eventually…Just give it some time, and the other characters of the movie will be in here too, of course. Author's Notes: Thank you everyone who reviewed/reviews. I really appreciate it. Okay, so I wanted to stay within this part of the movie through when we get to meet Sparky, but then I felt that the cheerleaders needed, well, a little time to relax after practice…so, I've added on what could have happened there, as well as a new take as to how Torrance could have found out about Aaron being a moron. Also, I'm going to Europe in a few days for a couple of weeks, so I won't be able to update until I get back, which I'm sorry for…But, just wait for me, and I promise that I'll be back soon enough, ready to update ;) And, as always, enjoy. Torrance was gesturing for a piece of paper and a pencil when Missy actually started to wake up. She handed it to her, frowning at the early time. \"So, what was that about?\" Missy asked when she hung up the phone. \"Aaron has someone for us to meet.\" Torrance was still scribbling furiously on the piece of paper. Missy leaned over to read the name and flinched at it. It was a very gaudy name. \"Like a special someone for us to meet?\" Torrance didn't appreciate the joke and glared at Missy. \"I'm joking,\" she shrugged and held her hands up in mock defense. \"A special someone, yes.\" The blonde continued as if Missy had not interrupted her. \"Someone who will help us with our routine.\" \"So, when do we meet him?\" Torrance was already punching new numbers into the phone when Missy asked. A moment later she had her answer. \"In two hours. At the school.\" \"Les, save me. It's early.\" Exactly two hours later, Torrance had started to explain the situation to the other cheerleaders and Missy had taken the time to complain to Les. He'd catch up on the plan sooner or later even without listening to Torrance. \"Is that all that's wrong?\" Missy looked exceptionally tired, and Les picked up on it. \"Yes,\" she practiced a fake smile on him. \"No,\" he shook his head, not believing her. \"We kissed,\" Missy closed her eyes momentarily as she admitted this. \"We did?\" Les looked amused. \"No, not us.\" The brunette glared at him, knowing that he just wanted to egg her on. \"Me and…\" She trailed off blushing \"Oooh. And then?\" God, he was so eager for news about her and Torrance. Apparently he didn't like Aaron either. Though, unlike the others, he never said that Aaron was gay, just an ass. \"And then I woke up to her talking to Aaron on the phone,\" Missy cringed remembering it. What a great way to wake up. \"Well…maybe she's just using him to get this guy here?\" He smiled at her, and she knew that he was just trying to make her feel better. \"She's been dating him since last year, Les.\" It wasn't helping. \"Cheer up, Bud.\" He hit her on the shoulder gently. \"Bud?\" Missy glanced over at him. He was suddenly acting…straight and, well, stupid. \"It's a guy thing.\" He announced proudly, only slightly flustered. \"But, I'm a girl,\" she complained as she pointed this out. He shrugged, deciding that it didn't matter. \"Line up,\" Sparky Polastri, their new instructor, had strutted, yes strutted, into the room. The talking immediately ceased through-out the gym, and a line formed. He walked by insulting them all. \"Smile,\" he paused to glance at Missy. She obliged. \"Don't smile.\" Immediately she felt the urge to pummel him, but she wouldn't for Torrance's sake. \"And I take you to be the head cheerleader?\" Torrance tried to explain herself, but Sparky didn't let her. \"You'll probably need the most work of all.\" She frowned, and Missy decided that Torrance would maybe beat him up before she did even. He continued with his insults through the whole rehearsal. \"Think of what you ate today and cut it in half. It's called a diet. I want you all to start one today.\" An argument had formed about who had to be on a diet. Sparky claimed they all did because, \"In cheerleading, people get thrown into the air, and fat people don't go as high.\" \"Can you believe that guy?\" Missy was furious as she stalked out of the gym with Les and Torrance at her side. \"He's our only chance,\" Torrance shrugged. \"We have to give him a chance.\" \"He's a loser,\" Les clarified. \"But he's all we've got,\" Missy finished the conversation with what they were all thinking in their heads. \"Very true,\" Les admitted, and they all sighed. \"We've got to do something.\" Missy smiled suddenly. They would get their minds off of the horrible practice, off of Nationals, and then maybe she could talk to Torrance about what was going on between them without the blonde avoiding it anymore. \"Something to relax,\" Les was into the idea. \"Movie?\" Missy asked cautiously, and Les nodded eagerly. \"Sure,\" Torrance also seemed satisfied with the idea of unwinding to see a movie…as long as it didn't include jazz hands. \"Great, because…well, that's where I was driving towards anyway.\" Les chuckled as they parked the car. It was late afternoon, and the parking lot wasn't too full yet. Thanks to this, they were able to find seats quickly in the theatre. Les was glancing around, trying to see if he knew anyone else there when he stopped short. \"Uh, maybe we don't want to go to a movie.\" \"Why?\" Immediately Missy's interest perked and she glanced around the movie theatre as well. The movie wasn't very popular and only a few couples were in there. There was a group of giggly preteens towards the front of the theatre, two older couples, and a teenaged couple making out in the back. \"That's Aaron,\" Les whispered. \"What?\" Unfortunately he didn't whisper well, and Torrance overheard. \"Oh my God. Bastard!\" If she didn't look ready to pummel Sparky…she looked ready to kill Aaron. \"Fuck,\" Missy cursed him. She wasn't sure why anyone would cheat on Torrance. She sure as hell wouldn't, but she also couldn't say that right now. \"I think he's working on it,\" Les muttered. He always knew that Aaron was an ass. \"Come on,\" Torrance stood up, a plan forming in her mind. She was going to confront him. Things had been rocky between them lately anyway…She reached a hand out to Missy, and pulled her up out of her seat as well. \"We'll be back.\" Les looked confused, but he sat there watching them anyway. \"Hi Aaron,\" as soon as he heard her voice, the couple jerked apart. \"Torrance! Hi!\" He tried to pretend like he was innocent, even though he was obviously caught red-handed…or red-headed-handed anyway. \"Who are you?\" The red-head glanced at Torrance obviously annoyed that they had interrupted them. It was bad enough that they had to come and make-out at the movie theatre, but she had wanted to go on an actual date with him instead of staying in the dorm rooms with him…and this is where he brought her. Romantic. \"I'm his…the sister of his ex-boyfriend. I guess you're his experiment?\" Torrance grinned at Aaron's face. He hadn't expected that; then again, neither did she. It just seemed so much sweeter than punching him. \"Go get 'um, Aaron!\" She grinned at him. \"He's never been with a girl before,\" Missy decided to help with the explanation. \"Until now,\" Torrance continued, and the red-head frowned. \"Torrance!\" Aaron glared at his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend before turning to the redhead girl. \"No, it's not…\" \"Loser. I'm not some experiment.\" She cut him off in the middle of his sentence and Missy and Torrance both had to hold in their laughs. \"Bright girl,\" Missy allowed herself one chuckle as the redhead hightailed it out of the theatre exit. \"Who are you exactly?\" Aaron turned his attention to the brunette who faltered at his question. \"My girlfriend,\" Torrance glanced at Missy who seemed stunned but not too fazed, then at Aaron, unsure of what would hurt him most. The only thing that she could think of was that maybe he would think he turned her gay…which he hadn't, because that's not possible. Aaron had a big enough ego to think it was though. Plus, she really just wanted to kiss Missy again, so she did. It was a quick kiss, but it got the point across. \"Buh-bye,\" Torrance muttered to Aaron after the kiss was over, and the two girls headed back over to Les who was gawking.[Chapter 8] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably only PG, due to some language. It may be raised to PG-13 in future chapters. Disclaimer: None of these characters are mine. I can't claim them (unfortunately for me). They all belong to hardworking people involved with the movie 'Bring it On.' Feedback: Yes please, I really want to know what everyone thinks of this so far. Summary: This will be a Torrance/Missy story eventually…Just give it some time, and the other characters of the movie will be in here too, of course. Author's Notes: Okay, I'm officially back. Whoo! And, as promised, the updates are also back. (Funny how that works?…Okay, maybe it's not THAT funny, but, a little bit of a chuckle? No?…Okay then, as you were.) Before the rambling ensues…Enjoy! And thank you to everyone who has reviewed. I really appreciate it. \"Whoa. What was that?\" Les watched the two girls as they wandered back towards him. He had been saving them seats towards the front of the theatre. \"I concur,\" Missy was as confused, if not more confused, than Les was. \"I'm glad to see that kissing Torrance has seemed to affected your vocabulary.\" Les chuckled at the brunette's word choice. She frowned at him. \"In a good way.\" She punched him in the arm to get her point across, and he laughed. \"Hey! What was that for?\" \"Les, I have to talk to Missy.\" Torrance ignored their playful banter because she had other things on her mind. \"I concur,\" Les echoed Missy's earlier words, and both girls this time scowled at him. \"Right. I'm going. I'll go…uh, watch the movie, and you two…go ahead and sit here and talk.\" \"What was that?\" Missy turned to face the cheerleader. She wasn't used to being the one not in control; she wasn't sure that she liked it. Actually, she knew that she didn't like it, but she wasn't sure how to make it stop, and that was her problem. \"A kiss,\" Torrance shrugged her shoulders, and Missy waited for another answer. \"Well, it seemed like a good way to get rid of Aaron…\" \"Was that all it was?\" Please don't let it be all. \"Was it?\" The brunette hid her nervousness by playing with the armrest on the chair. Torrance didn't reply right away. \"Look, we can't.\" \"Can't what? Can't go to the circus because clowns scare you? Can't take on the Clovers?\" Missy knew exactly what Torrance didn't think she could do, but she didn't want to hear that, not from her. \"Tor, I'm not asking you to marry me…not that that's legal anyway.\" Missy paused for a moment, and she got what she wanted. The blonde smirked a bit at her humor. \"Oh? Is that a smile that I see…\" Immediately Torrance wiped the smile from her face. She couldn't do that. No. It didn't work like that. She was supposed to have a boyfriend. Well, not the Aaron kind of boyfriend…maybe a Cliff kind of boyfriend. \"Missy, I'm serious. Be serious.\" \"I am being serious. We can't legally get married, and clowns are nasty.\" Missy smiled again, trying to get Torrance to smile back at her; she didn't…well, maybe a little. \"Missy…\" Torrance sighed as the previews started and the lights dimmed. \"Fine. I'll go to the circus with you if it means that much to you…\" Missy was convinced that humor would get her through this talk. \"We can't date.\" Fine. If Missy was going to be like that, making jokes, then Torrance had no choice but to be completely serious and blunt. \"Why? Commitment issues? Too soon from your break-up?\" Missy reached out for the blonde's hand, and to her surprise, Torrance let her hold it. It was more serious than anything to do with Aaron, and Missy had a good idea what was bothering the blonde cheerleader. \"You're a girl,\" she sighed heavily, pulling her hand away from Missy's. \"I noticed,\" Missy smirked. She just didn't get it. She was playing stupid, and it was making things that much harder for Torrance. \"I'm a girl too.\" \"You're full of surprises aren't you?\" Missy feigned shock at hearing that Torrance was a girl, and this time the head cheerleader wasn't amused. \"No, Missy. You know what I mean.\" There was a heavy sigh, but neither girl was exactly sure who it came from. \"I can't be with you. Not like that.\" That was that. Torrance smiled at Missy and left. Just like that. She left the movie theatre. A few minutes later, Les wandered over to see if Missy was okay, and all she could do was shrug. She was not going to cry. She was not going to cry. She managed to tell him that she would walk home, and he should just take Torrance home, and for once, he didn't make any smart aleck comments, he just nodded and hugged his friend before driving home another. She cried. It was after the interview on television, and after the flop of a performance that multiple teams besides them also performed, that Cliff was cozying up to Torrance again. She had just been informed that they had to come up with a brand new routine. More work, but that didn't matter at the moment. He was smiling at her, and she was smiling back, or she was trying to anyway. Her day had been shit, and maybe flirting with him would help. Well, it could help if she could stop focusing on his sister who she couldn't help but notice talking to Darcy about something, probably Sparky. Missy turned around to see where the rest of the team was when she noticed Torrance talking to her brother. It figured. She smiled at Darcy before wandering back by them. Both girls had agreed silently that the only way that they could resist temptation was to not talk. They talked with the rest of the squad around during practice, but not in private for days. The two were no longer stretching partners. So, it shocked the blonde when she felt the brunette's breath in her ear, whispering to her before walking away just as quickly. \"Is he the kind of person that you can be with?\"[Chapter 9] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably PG-13ish…due to some language and some sexual content. Disclaimer: None of these characters are mine. I can't claim them (unfortunately for me). They all belong to hardworking people involved with the movie 'Bring it On.' Feedback: Yes please, I really want to know what everyone thinks of this so far. Summary: This will be a Torrance/Missy story eventually…Just give it some time, and the other characters of the movie will be in here too, of course. Author's Notes: Thank you everyone who reviews/reviewed! It's so greatly appreciated. And, I don't have too much to say, so…Enjoy! A new routine. The words rang again and again in Torrance's mind. She felt awful when the squad was forced to look unprofessional because they had the same routine as several other teams. It just wasn't fair. She cursed Big Red for doing that to her. A glance over her shoulder made her curse…everything. Missy was practicing the moves with Darcy as her partner. That was supposed to be her practicing the moves with Missy. The blonde almost forgot why she wasn't the one with Missy practicing when Cliff strolled downstairs. \"Hey Torr!\" \"Hey Cliff,\" Torrance had wandered inside to get a drink of water. Everyone in the squad was outside warming up some more, but she had wandered off for the moment. Apparently Cliff was waiting for that kind of a moment. \"You guys all ready for Nationals in a few days?\" He smiled at her and nervously ran a hand through his dark hair. \"We will be,\" she smiled at him as she took her bottled water off of the counter. The blonde had forgotten it inside earlier, when she had first arrived. \"Will be?\" He quirked an eyebrow at her. \"That's why we're gonna watch this.\" Torrance picked up a video tape off of the counter, and with a flick of her wrist, showed him the cover. \"A tape of different dances?\" \"You got it,\" she nodded. \"Let me guess…You're also going to practice mime, tomorrow?\" Wow. Torrance smiled; he was good. \"You learn quick,\" she allowed him another smile. \"Wait. I was kidding.\" He laughed, waiting for her to say that she was kidding. \"Kidding,\" he smirked, waiting. It never came. \"Were you serious?\" \"You're cute when you're confused.\" She smirked and poked his shoulder with one finger, before turning around and walking back towards the living room and the door, which would lead to her squad. He stood there for a moment in confusion before turning and heading back upstairs. Playing guitar always helped him think. \"I'd say that he looks more like a dumb ass like that.\" Torrance whipped around to see Missy leaning against the wall in the living room. \"God, stop doing that!\" She frowned at her friend. She always managed to sneak inside without the blonde noticing it. \"Stop doing what?\" Missy had left the squad, saying that she was going to find Torrance; no one cared anyway. They were focused on learning the few new moves that they had practiced so far. \"Sneaking up on me!\" Torrance had backed up against the couch, still shaking her head at the brunette. Missy shrugged. \"It's my house. We don't have to practice here, you know.\" \"Just stop,\" Torrance folded her arms uneasily across her chest. \"Stop what?\" Missy lifted an eyebrow and smirked, knowing that she was getting to the blonde. \"Stop everything.\" Missy took a step closer to the blonde. \"And do what?\" Missy tilted her head to the side, and Torrance shrugged. \"Do I look cute when I'm confused too, Torr?\" She wasn't asking it playfully, nor aggressively. She was simply asking. \"Stop it,\" Torrance didn't have a real answer for her, not one that she could say out loud anyway. \"You didn't have to kiss me that night.\" Missy looked questioningly at the blonde. \"You could have brought Les over there and kissed him.\" \"I don't like Les like that. He's my friend.\" Torrance shrugged again, and Missy took another step closer, so that she was standing directly in front of Torrance. She crossed her own arms across her chest. \"And what am I?\" \"You're…\" Torrance struggled for an appropriate word. \"You're Missy.\" \"So, you don't want this?\" The brunette reached forward and took the blonde's hand in her own gently. Torrance intertwined her fingers with Missy's. \"The rest of the squad is in the backyard; your brother is in the next room, maybe upstairs now, I don't know.\" \"You know where I am.\" Missy smirked. \"And why's that?\" \"Because you're obnoxious,\" Torrance couldn't help but smile, and Missy rolled her eyes. \"Me? Obnoxious? I'm not the one dating your brother.\" Torrance's smile stopped; Missy had hit a nerve on that one. \"Be glad that you've never met my brother.\" Torrance mumbled before glancing down at the floor, not letting go of the brunette's hand. \"Torrance, look at me.\" \"No,\" Torrance mumbled again, not glancing up at the dark brown eyes she knew would be looking at her. \"Why not?\" Missy, for once, was patient. \"Because…if I do, then I…I can't, okay. I can't.\" If she did, then she'd kiss her. It was simple in her mind, but when she tried to say it, the words got messed up. Missy had a hint as to why Torrance wouldn't look at her. She knew that Torrance had to like her; she was the one who had kissed her the other night, after all. All that mattered was whether or not Torrance would let herself be happy. \"Just look at me. Once, Torrance. Look up. It's not hard. Use your neck muscles.\" Torrance rolled her eyes and lifted her head, looking Missy in the eyes. \"Happy now?\" \"Are you?\" Missy was being serious, and Torrance wasn't sure how to deal with it. She was used to Missy making sarcastic comments and jokes at every possible moment. \"You don't look it when you're with my brother.\" \"Stop it,\" Torrance said it once more, but by now it was down to a whisper. \"No,\" Missy shook her head, still looking Torrance in the eyes, when the blonde realized the close proximity of their bodies and lifted her head, kissing the brunette's lips, knowing that Missy wasn't going to make the first move. The kissing stopped, and Missy smiled at the blonde before turning serious. \"You know you can't have both of us, right?\" \"I know,\" Torrance whispered back. She did know. She knew that she needed to get back out there to the squad to practice before they wandered back inside to see what was going on; she knew that she needed to decide if she wanted to be with the one she really wanted, or the one that she was supposed to want.[Chapter 10] Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably PG-13ish…due to some language and some sexual content. Disclaimer: None of these characters are mine. I can't claim them (unfortunately for me). They all belong to hardworking people involved with the movie 'Bring it On.' I also do not own The Ramones, The Clash, or The Sex Pistols. They're just awesome bands. And, 'I Wanna Be Sedated' is not mine either. It's by The Ramones. Feedback: Yes please, I really want to know what everyone thinks of this so far. Summary: This will be a Torrance/Missy story eventually…Just give it some time, and the other characters of the movie will be in here too, of course. Author's Notes: Thank you to everyone who has reviewed, and who reviews this chapter. I really appreciate the feedback. This is the final chapter in this story, so you know, and it's also the point where I could make a corny joke about it being the end, and also just the beginning in several ways…but I'll spare you that. There's a line in here where Torrance gets cut off, by herself, while talking, but her thought continues. The thought will be in italics and in bold. All time difference are marked by a straight line separating the story. And, I had some comments about how I was making Torrance homophobic in this story, and I'd like to simply say that I didn't intend for her to be homophobic. Because, in my opinion homophobia is where you would be incredibly cruel and unjust or very scared of homosexual people, and I didn't mean for Torrance to appear like that. She's simply a girl who's scared of what everyone else would think if she was in love with a girl, and like so many people, whether they be straight or bisexual or gay, she's a bit scared of the prospect of falling in love. That's just my opinion, and that's what I meant to convey for her…Anyway, enough of my rambling. Enjoy! The blonde shifted from one foot to the other. \"Look, I really like you.\" She really hated conversations like that, especially ones on the day before Nationals. \"But,\" the Pantone looked at her, waiting for the rest. Torrance sighed, \"But, I just want to be friends with you.\" A simple rolling of the eyes. \"Can't you think of a non-overused line?\" \"Um,\" Torrance paused for a moment, hoping to think of something else. She might be saying that she couldn't be with the person, but she really would like to be friends, especially since she was going to date the sibling… \"No,\" she admitted, suddenly slightly shy. \"At least you're honest.\" The Pantone shrugged and smiled a little bit. The smile was forced, but it was a decent effort anyway. Torrance smiled back, relieved. \"I'm trying to be. Honest, that is.\" The Pantone had to know; had to ask the real question. \"Why just friends?\" \"Because there's someone else.\" Torrance should have seen this question coming. Either Pantone would have asked her this actually. \"Someone I know?\" A quick smirk as a surveillance of Torrance's obvious discomfort became available. \"Someone who lives in the same house as me?\" The blonde girl nodded. \"Go figure.\" Torrance bit her lip, trying to judge the look on the Pantone's face. \"Are you mad?\" \"How can I be?\" A shrug. \"I can't help your sexual orientation.\" \"Actually,\" Torrance paused for a moment; it'd be easier if she didn't say the next part maybe. \"I'm pretty sure that I'm bisexual.\" Easier, but not as honest, so she said it anyway. \"Okay,\" a grimace. That one hurt. The Pantone had tried and failed. \"Well, I can't help who you fall in love with.\" It was the night before Nationals, and the Toros were done practicing. Torrance and Missy were sharing a room in the hotel. They were talking to each other since the kiss, but they made sure to avoid all conversation about it. No words about feelings, about brothers, about each other. Then, Torrance cracked.rn\"Thank God you're here this season Missy. I couldn't have done it alone. \" \"Aw, tear.\" Missy rolled her eyes; her voice was full of sarcasm. \"No! I mean it.\" Torrance reached for Missy's hand, and they shared a smile. Before any talk of feelings could happen, Missy heard the shouting coming from outside. Someone was still practicing outside, and it was really obnoxious. She stood up and walked over to the window and yelled back. \"Shut up! If you don't have it now, you don't have it!\" It broke any kind of moment there could have been. A group of the cheerleaders, Jan and Missy and Torrance, were standing there together when Justin wandered up. \"Hey babe,\" he greeted Missy. \"You in a giving mood?\" He flicked his tongue out at her in a way that he hoped was suggestive. He was nothing like his sister, because Missy wouldn't do what she did to Justin next to Torrance. \"Yeah, sure,\" she agreed as she flicked his head with her hand. \"Ow! Bitch,\" he grumbled, looking at her. \"I'll tell all of your friends that you were here,\" Torrance threatened, and Justin flicked her off, before stalking away in his 'Cheerleading Death' t-shirt. Missy chuckled. \"Told you that you should be glad that you didn't know my brother.\" But Jan was already fascinated by the lovely article of clothing that Justin had been wearing on his head, before Missy had snapped it off to smack the back of his head. Both girls rolled their eyes at Jan. The day of Nationals went extremely quickly and so slowly at the same time. It took forever until they were able to perform, but then suddenly they seemed to be announcing the winner. Toros were second place. The Clovers had won. \"Second place. How does it feel?\" Missy turned to glance at Torrance, who was grinning. \"It feels like first!\" And then the whole squad was cheering. They were cheering for themselves and the Clovers. \"You were better.\" Torrance admitted it to Isis who seemed to consider it.","LastChapter":"Title: Bad Luck Isn't Contagious Rating: This chapter is probably PG-13ish…due to some language and some sexual content.

She had changed so much since being reunited with her family in her homeland, the Underground. She had grown into a woman. She had blossomed into a goddess of femininity along the way, as befitting her station of royalty. She looked magnificent in her velvet robes of red and gold standing by her father's throne. The robes hugged her figure gracefully, revealing her womanly curves as much as they hid them by flaring off her rounded hips to pool around her feet. Her crown of spun gold was nestled in her mane of black curls. The crown was barely visible in the wavy mass that had grown long enough to sweep her hips in a curtain of dark silk. The woman's spine was straight as she gazed around the golden courtroom. Lit candles surrounded her, casting her visage in a yellow glow. But, she was far from happy in such splendor. Her dark brown eyes were narrowed in distaste. She was beautiful. She was a Princess. But, she was getting old. \"You said the same thing when you were fourteen,\" her father, the King, mumbled quietly so only she would hear. \"You said it also when you were fifteen. At sixteen you disappeared for two weeks. Seventeen, you barricaded yourself in the tower for a month, but now daughter-,\" he rose from his throne to stand before her, every inch the imposing monarch, \"you are eighteen, far past the normal marrying age. And, I refuse to cater to your fears of matrimony any longer.\" If only he knew what she really feared. It was not marriage, not in the least. She wished she was married. Her only dilemma was,...none of the eligible nobles lined up before her were the one she wanted. While all the well groomed Fae men stood waiting patiently, shuffling their feet occasionally, hoping to be chosen. Picked out like she was deciding on what shoes to wear that day, her real object of desire stood in the shadows. Hidden at the far end of the courtroom, barely visible. Trying his best not be noticed, but she noticed him. She always noticed him. Moanna did not have to see him to feel his comforting presence. She did not have to look up and gaze into his cloudy blue eyes, misted over like he was blind, when he was anything but. She knew he was there, watching silently. One of the oldest servants to the king and to the royal family. He was powerful. He was frighteningly beautiful. But, he was a Faun. Pan had been her guardian, protector, and teacher before she had even known she was a princess. She had died and been born again. Only to die in another world and then be led, by him, to this one. She owed him everything. Her life, her crown, and her heart. Only he didn't know that. Pan didn't know that he was the reason why she hid when it came time to be betrothed, unwilling to sacrifice her heart to another. That she could not bare the thought of being with one of her kind because of him and his understanding. Pan had taught her everything she knew of the Underground. Telling her all the things she had forgotten in a past life, with the patience that would rival a saint. Only he seemed to have time for her in this life. He was always willing to answer all of her questions, no matter how small or mundane. Pan understood that she had no memory of who she once was. He knew how hard it was for her not to know what she was supposed to know, when nobody had the time to tell her. Her Fae parents loved her, Moanna knew that, but they were always too busy to deal with her. So, she had been handed over to Pan for guidance, and lost her heart somewhere along the way. \"You will chose a husband now,\" her father ordered loud enough so all assembled could hear, \"I will wait no longer for your future to be secure.\" Moanna shifted, moving her weight from one foot to the other, uncomfortable to be forced into this. \"I am afraid you will not like who I choose, Father,\" she whispered to him. The king's gaze softened at her words, his harsh tone disappearing as quickly as it appeared. \"It has gotten to the stage, Daughter, where I only wish to see you married. You have someone in mind do you not? I can see your thoughts about him in your eyes.\" Moanna shifted again. \"Yes, father, I do... But, he is not one of these Fae before you.\" Her father stood taller, relief playing across his features. \"Then speak, child, speak. So that I may summon him to court. Speak his name so all can hear.\" The princess braced herself for the worst, heaving huge breaths of air into her shuddering lungs, hoping that the action would fortify her for what she was about to do. \"Pan.\" She spoke loudly and clearly to her waiting audience. \"I want Pan.\" The reaction was instant. Looks of disbelief being shared by all. That the princess would want to choose such an unlikely groom. That she was want an ancient servant for a husband, one that was not even of her species, was impossible for their noble minds to comprehend. Nervously Moanna looked into her father's eyes, waiting for his verdict. A clear storm of mixed emotions surrounding him. \"Pan,\" her father bellowed, so the stunned servant in the shadows would hear, \"come up here.\" The faun stepped into the light with a jerking motion, his armored skin creaking like the wood it appeared to be. His goat ears flipping back and forth below his curved horns, the only indication of his agitated internal thoughts. He moved slowly forward, his joints popping like a camp fire at night. With an uneven swagger he appeared deceptively unsteady as he followed the kings orders, ascending to the throne. His lank, dirty blond hair swaying with every stride. Moanna froze as she watched Pan move towards her and the King, his cloudy gaze focused on her. She had to remind herself to keep breathing when he finally came to a stop before them. His shoulders hunching forward, trying to diminish his towering height in a sign of respect for the royalty. \"Did you know anything about this Pan?\" \"No, your Highness,\" the faun said, bowing lower as he spoke, \"This is as new to me, as it is to you.\" Pan's strange voice never failed to captivate Moanna. He spoke exactly how he walked, words pitching up and down, like a ship being rocked on the sea. \"Explain yourself, Daughter,\" the king ordered, turning to her. She had gotten this far, Moanna would not back down when what she wanted was so near. \"I refuse to marry unless it is to Pan,\" she declared. \"Princess, why do you say such things?\" the faun spoke, drawing all of her attention, \"You are upsetting your father with this drama. You can not mean what you say. As his eldest daughter, and with no sons your husband will have a seat to the throne. A lowly faun like me can not be given such a thing like that.\" \"He is right daughter,\" her father added, \"choose instead from the Fae men before you.\" \"No,\" Moanna spoke, defying them both, \"I will not marry another. I choose Pan.\" \"Princess,\" the faun entreated again, \"you must stop this ploy of yours not to wed by choosing me-\" \"It is no ploy,\" she whispered softly to the creature, \"I love you, and I will have no other.\" Moanna's heart thrummed in her chest at her confession. She had wanted to tell him for so long how she felt. \"Buh!\" the faun spat, straightening to his full height, \"You know nothing of love and you are being childish right now.\" Moanna flinched like he had slapped her. Her eyes filling with tears at his rejection. Never had Pan been this cruel to her. At the sight of her tears the faun returned to his hunched position. His cat shaped eyes widening in horror as he realized how much his outburst had hurt her. He opened his mouth to say something more, but she was already fleeing, running from the golden courtroom. \"Halt!,\" her father yelled before she had made it out the door. Moanna froze with her head hung, but she did not turn to face them. \"I can see this is of no light consequence to you daughter. You truly wish to take the faun to wed?\" She nodded slowly, still wanting to be with Pan even after he had rejected her. \"Then,\" her father sighed, \"there may be a way. Your mother has found out that she is expecting,\" happy gasps could be heard around the golden room, \"If the baby is a boy then I will give you my full consent to wed. And until the child is born I give you both full permission to court each other. You may find with time you are not suited for one another. In which case all this madness can be forgotten for good. Do both of you agree on this?\" Moanna waited until she heard Pan's 'yes, your Majesty' to add her own, and then she was running again. That night she locked herself in her room and refused to eat. The servants could hear her weeping as they passed by the door. One of those servants happened to have a set of curved horns. Flame if you feel the need. Not enough people write stories for this movie.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: don't own Pan's Labyrinth, but I do own this story. Special mentions: Queenofhearts: thanks dude for following my writing to this one and reading it. It always sucks starting a new story because no one has it on their alert yet. So thank you for taking the time. I too loved the faun when he walked on screen, I was all 'Well, that is different', and then spent the rest of the film staring at him whenever he came on, trying to decided if he was ugly or just a different sort of attractive. I think he shut Moanna down mainly due to shock, and it was a knee jerk reaction for him to protect himself by pushing her away. Men do that some times. As for the King, well he is a King. They order people to do things ware crowns and eat really good food. So in short, most kings are full of themselves, and fae kings are no exception. Illegitimi: thank you so much for reading this. It's a new story, so the first chapter released is always daunting because you don't know how it will go down. And I am speaking in a different voice. I changed it to suit the fantasy feel better, so no swearing in this like my sci-fi. Even though I love to drop the F bomb in my writing you won't find it here. And who could not be taken by Pan, he had me amazed when he creaked his way on screen, with she spontaneous twitching here and there. And yeah, I will admit to having a thing for personalities that aren't quite human, they bring a flavor to romance that is far more tasty and complex. Much more interesting eating. And you rock more then me. MyDyingDaysBlackRose: why hello. You may not know this, but I have a thing with my reviewers were I talk to them like they're real people. Yes, I know shocking. So thank you for your review. It was very much appreciated. A week after the confrontation, Pan and the Princess still hadn't spoken to each other. Pan retreated into woods and only came out when he was summoned. Moanna did a similar thing, spending most her time in her room, and refusing to speak to anyone. One time the two crossed paths in a hallway and neither acknowledged the other's presence, even if they both turned back, only just missing each other's gaze. As this awkwardness continued the Princess was no longer attending her lessons. She was avoiding her education entirely, so that she could avoid her teacher in turn. It was only when the King realized the situation that he ordered his daughter to attend to her studies again, and that's where they were now. Sitting in their small class room, as the sun shined brightly through the window. Casting the room in a merry yellow glow, when the occupants were anything but. Moanna sat at her usual desk watching as Pan scribbled things onto the blackboard in his usual messy scrawl. He had been writing on the board when the princess had arrived, and he was still scrawling things with his back to her. She had yet to see his eyes once. \"So, we are pretending that nothing happened then?,\" she asked softly, knowing he would hear her with his Faun ears. Pan's hand froze half way through screeching the chalk against the board. Only to resume his writing a second later, leaving her question unanswered. \"Is it because I am not a Faun? Is that why you don't want me?\" \"Please turn to page one-hundred-and-thirty-five, and recite the poem to me,\" he spoke unfazed. Moanna did none of that. \"I disgust you then, is that it? Can't bare the thought of tying yourself to me?\" The chalk snapped in his wooden hand. \"I should be asking you the same question, Princess. Do I not disgust you?\" Moanna didn't need to think on her response. \"I find you handsome. I always have.\" \"There you go again, Princess. Saying things that you can not possibly comprehend.\" She was on her feet quickly, her chair clattering to the floor. Throwing her tome of a text book at the faun in a fit of rage. It struck him in the back of the head, slamming him into the blackboard. Smudging his writing, as chalk dust was thrown into the air. He snarled, righting himself as he turned to face her more animal then man. \"Princess!-,\" he growled. \"Moanna!,\" she screamed, cutting him off, \" if you are going to insult me use my name, and say it like you mean it. Like you do when you come to me in my dreams at night. Where you have been visiting me since I turned of age. Say it for every time you have stared at me thinking I didn't noticed, too thick horned to see I was looking back. Say my name at least once before you break my heart!\" All the anger drained out of the faun at her impassioned words. \"Princess...\" he entreated softly. It didn't matter what tone he used, the fact that he didn't say her name said it all to her. She could feel tears prickling at the back of her eyes. \"Why do you not want me?,\" she asked in broken whisper. Pan came to stand in front of her, hunching so they were at eye level. \"It is not a question of want, Princess.\" He reached forward to brush her hair from her face, and she flinched away from him. Not wanting him to touch her after the harsh words he had spoken. \"Who could not want you? You are beautiful,\" he smiled weakly, \"but it is not my place to marry you. When these nine months are up, you will either have a baby brother...or sister. If it is a sister we will not be allowed to marry, and if it is a brother you will have had time to realize your mistake and we will not be wed. Either way I lose.\" Moanna opened her mouth to protest, only for his wooden fingers to be placed on her lips. \"Princesses do not marry Fauns.\" he spoke each word slowly, like they were a sentence all on their own. She locked eyes with him, as a small ray of hope started to grow in her. Yes, he had said much to deter her, but he hadn't said the harsh words of rejection that she had been expecting. \"Would you have me if I wasn't a Princess?,\" she asked. Everything in her depended on his answer. Every hope she had for the future, every dream. The faun shook his head, ears twitching as his massive frame creaked with strain. \"But you are a princess, Moanna. There will never be a way that I could deserve you, or this love you say you have for me.\" \"I see.\" she said, watching as the faun slumped with apparent relief. Inside herself Moanna smiled. There was hope here, she could feel it. She just had to make the thick horned male see it as well. A sense of determination like no other fell upon her then. With the grace that was bred into her, she stepped around Pan and made for the classroom door. \"Princess, where are you going? We still have a lesson to finish.\" \"I suddenly find myself with more important things to do. And we have already studied that poem,\" she watched as the Faun looked at the blackboard frowning, \"you taught it to me on a day two years ago. I remember because that was also the day you told me I had beautiful hair, and that I should let it grow out.\" She watched in amusement, as the Faun's eyes honed in on the long hair that now reached her hips, and knew she didn't have to point out the obvious. \"I'll see you next lesson, Pan,\" she said with a radiant smile, that had been missing for the past week. She swept from the room in a bellow of skirts, leaving a stunned faun scratching at his horns. He had known her for several years. He also knew when she was planing something. And the Princess was planing something. Flame if you want to, at least I'm getting another review then.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: don't own Pan's Labyrinth, but I do own this story. Special mentions: Queenofhearts:Ok, maybe me calling him ugly wasn't exactly the best way to describe my reaction. Perhaps strangely exotic is better. Yeah, I enjoyed the book throwing myself. There is only so much stubbornness a girl can take before she snaps. Pan did deserve it too, and I think that deep down he knows what she's saying is true. He's just being cautious. And yes, he is going to love what the princess has in store for him. He comes to his senses in this chapter. MyDyingDaysBlackRose: As cool as it would be if you were a zombie, I know reviewers aren't. You guys actually give good advice and opinions if I let you..so I let you. Simple I know, but I'm surprised how many authors don't bother trying. As for the characters of Pan and Moanna. I wanted to keep them as close as I could to the movie. The Princess is older now, and I wanted her to me more outspoken (she is royalty), and know what she wants. Pan is old, but cautious. A solitary creature worn down by the years. He is already attached to Moanna, he just hasn't realized how much she's grown up yet, but he'll see soon. Xeye: I see you found my new story, brilliant. Sorry about not putting all your pen name at the beginning. Document manger likes to take out words when there are to many full stops around them. So I have to rename people sometimes. Zyra: your review actually never reached me because of FF net stuff ups, but I saw your review when I checked my story on line. So I'm glad I checked in now, I love new reviewers. Pan is amazing. If it wasn't for his quirky appearance in the film, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. And as for you not knowing what he is thinking,... this chapter helps clear that up. So enjoy. Illegitimi:phenomenal is a very strong word, and it means a lot coming from you. Moanna has all of the personality traits you mentioned, manly because she has been raised as a princess from 14 years of age. So it gives her a strange mixture of confidence and hesitancy, which I try to bring out. And don't praise my switching styles too much. I have to read some of my previous chapters to get in the mood for the story before I can write anything. And I'm the one that does all the envying in this relationship. I will never have your powers of description, so only I can be the jealous one here. As for dialogue, you and I both know that the key to a good story is awesome dialogue. And to steal a fav. Quote of mine 'what's said is said', so every thing that comes out of my characters mouths has to be important to the story. And an acolyte are you? Fortunately I will not make the mistake of making another Overlord sepal, and then have people from all over the world tell me their my minions. No, I can learn from my bouts of insanity sometimes. J ennaBo: I was just about to post this when i was all 'hold on', it says I have ten reviews. so, lucky you. I agree that not many people do this pairing, so I felt obligated to do something about that, and even less people do a M rated version of the couple, so again I felt obligated. also WTF, Pan and Pale man. I hope they were smoking something really good to write that. I'm all for artistic expression but (to go gangsta) 'that shit's wak'. \"The woman is trying to destroy me.\" Pan muttered to himself, sitting on a log outside his home deep in the woods of the underground. The fairies that buzzed around him giggled at his words, reading the book he held over his shoulder when he wasn't looking only to giggle more. In the month that followed their discussion in the classroom Moanna had taken to seducing Pan, but it wasn't by any normal means of the term. If she had set out to destroy him with flashes of skin and forbidden words Pan would have been able to fight it. But no, the Princess had actually decided to 'court' him. When the King had declared the months ahead to be time for them to court, he had assumed that the task was meant to fall on his shoulders, not the other way around. He had lived centuries and never had a woman tried to romance him . And quite frankly, he didn't know how to handle this situation at all,... and he wasn't sure if he entirely hated it either. He was sitting outside his home on a log simply because he couldn't fit in it anymore. The giant hollowed out willow that used to house both him and his fairy companions quite comfortably, was now packed to the leaves with gifts . And these were not normal courting gifts for a member of royalty either. If they had been he could have refused them with a clear conscious. If they had been treasures taken from her family's vault he would have been fine. He almost wished his gifts were rare gems, spun gold, and beaten coins that he could snort at. Instead Moanna had given him things worth much more value. Handmade gifts. Felt beads threaded on necklaces of twine, pressed flowers, woven wreaths that fit snug on his horns. Painted landscapes in water colors, fine strips of plated leather fashioned into bracelets. A cuff of polished leather that had his name heat pressed into it. She had even knitted and sown him things; a small patchwork miniature of him, delicate cross stitches that spelled his name, even a knitted pair of gloves that he now wore all the time, as they had taken a lot of work to put on over his splintered fingers, with threads of wool catching in the wood. Now it would simply be too much work to take them off. These were just some of the gifts, handmade and specifically tailored to him. How could anyone refuse a gift that someone had put such time, effort and thought into? Pan certainly couldn't, that's why his tree was currently full, and he now had to sleep beside it hidden in its giant roots. He had accepted every single one of her gifts with a smile, as he took them from her open hands, her own grin beaming back at him. These handmade items were on their own able to sway him, but the woman had doomed him with her latest gift. When she had handed him the small yet heavy wooden chest and told he to open it when he was at home, Pan had thought he was finally getting the shallow minded treasure he had so dearly wanted to throw back at her. No, what he had been given was far from gold and yet so close to treasure. It was a collection of her journals. Diaries filled with dated entries going back to her arrival in the Underground. Writings of her innermost thoughts and feelings. Writings that he should have never been allowed to read, and he cursed her for giving them to him, because he had read every single one of them,...twice. And even though he should have seen it coming, it still surprised him that he was the main character in all of them. Oh, they had started innocently enough. The ones that dated back to when she was fourteen, telling him of how much she looked up to him and respected him. Telling him of how she would silently thank him every day for bring her back home, for having the patience to teach her. He had smiled fondly at all of these entries, remembering the days when the little girl would cling to him and follow him everywhere like he was her father instead of the King, but then the entries started to change. Her declarations of platonic love becoming anything but as she came of age. Then the journals were filled only with thoughts of him. She had taken her time studying him and it showed. She had detailed drawings and descriptions on the way he walked, talked, and moved. She seemed to take delight in drawing his face over, and over again, in an almost obsessive manner. Pan now knew what he looked like from every angle imaginable. His image was practically burned into his brain by repetition. But, even seeing these diary entries hadn't effected him that much,... until Moanna had started having dreams about him. Described in the most vivid detail, Pan now knew all of her fantasies. Maddeningly erotic entries could spread for up to five pages in length, so that nothing was left out, and not one written detail had passed his eyes as he read. With his face inches from the book and his breathing irregular, he read every one of his dream conquests, while his ears twitched and his leg occasionally jerked. How a virgin mind could come up with some of the positions and situations he didn't know, but he could certainly appreciate the descriptions even if they were technically impossible feats of flexibility. The written entries alone had driven him insane, but the real nail in the coffin had come when Moanna had stopped describing, and started depicting. Drawings of him and her could be seen spread out (in two definitions of the terms meaning), in tangles of arms, legs and horns. In one section of the journal Pan could gather the pages together, flick,... and then observe himself in motion. Pan had never been scandalized in his entire existence, but watching himself thrust for thrust almost made him so. By the time he finished all the books Pan knew that he had been wrong about the Princess. She was not ignorant when it came to him...or love, because the diaries were not just filled with frustrating eroticism, but with heart wrenching emotions as well. He may have been able to brush her ardor aside if it wasn't for the fact that for every one of her praises, a flaw of his was also noted, and she still wrote that she loved him regardless. The Princess truly did love him. As hard as it was for him to fathom she really did. She had even been in love with him for many years. How could he not have seen it? But the truth of the matter was, he had seen it only to dismiss it as foolish thinking. All the shy glances, and pleading stares. Begging for his attention with her eyes, while she asked him questions she already knew the answers to. All these years when he was secretly looking at her, thinking she could never want him, she had been looking straight back. Moanna was right he was thick horned, and after reading all the journals he knew just how thick he really was. How badly it must have hurt her, when he told her she was childish. She had the right to cry, and he only had himself to blame. After all the gifts and revelations he could not plead ignorance anymore. Sighing he closed the journal he was reading, dropping it back into the chest. Ignoring the fairies when they pulled it back out, opening it to giggle at a detailed sketch. He walked over to his home with his usual jerking strides, and reached inside the opening. Carefully moving all of his new possessions aside to uncover a loose piece of bark in the back of the tree. He snapped the wood off completely to reveal a hidden compartment and a scroll of parchment. Yellowed with age and bound loosely, it was covered in a slight layer of dirt, like most things would be when stored in a tree. Pan carefully opened the stiff paper, and gazed at his own drawing. In what felt like a lifetime ago he had stumbled on the princess late at night, bathing in an old fountain wearing only her shift. She still had shoulder length hair then, and her hips were not as rounded, but she had still been beautiful. The sight had burned in the back of his head until he drew the picture to ease the pressure on his conscience. He showed her absolutely drenched with water, her hair weighted down and dripping. Material plastered to her skin, as she lifted her shift high, exposing her thighs as she took a step forward. If Moanna knew of this drawing's existence he would be doomed. She would know that he had felt the same all along. He still didn't deserve her. He didn't think he ever would, but now he could admit to himself what he had always been trying to ignore. That he loved her. That he wanted her. He was truly doomed now, only that wasn't how he felt when he snuck into her room and placed the scroll on her pillow for her to find. Instead he felt hopeful. Flame if you want. Any publicity is good publicity.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer:don't own Pan's Labyrinth, but I do own this story. Special mentions Sorry about the delay, I've had a lot of stuff to deal with lately. Shadow of Darkness: yes, the virgin mind is very creative. Even more so because it has nothing to compare it to. Imagination is all she has to go on, and she has a very good imagination...and now Pan knows that too. Ps. Glad I could make you laugh. Illegitimi: psychological warfare is every woman's best weapon, and Moanna knows how to hit hard and right on target. Smart cookie that one. Also, of course this story flows. I worked really hard to make it flow, and make me sound smart. But I could never sound as smart as you, with some of the words you throw into your stories. There is always one for every chapter you write that I have to look up for a definition. Queenofhearts: Pan has been in love for a while. He's just been in denial. It's funny that you mentioned their courting because it does take a step up in this chapter, and as for faun loving...well, there is some of that as well. Surprise (like you ask for) is also in there but faun loving is more important. Megumisakura: Ok! Estelle Tiniwiel: Creative lenience is an amazing thing. I wanted the two characters to come together,...so I made them. Every piece of a puzzle can fit if you use a hammer (my brain being the hammer). And if I can convince you that they belong together (for the duration of the story), then I am using my hammer properly. Characterization is very important to me. If I can get that right then the plot will just flow. I focus mainly on characters to tell the truth. Why people do things is more important then how people do things (for me).I also do my homework before writing. I think how would I act if I was a princess that was not raised to be one from birth. How would I think if I was a centuries old faun. You know, stuff that all writers do I'm sure. I hope you enjoy this chapter. Things start to get physical now. PS: I hope you also have a nice day/evening. Thank you for the praise as well. \"Ow, do not pull on it.\" Pan barked at a fairy as it pulled out a lock of his hair instead of a dead leaf. He sat in the old fountain on the edge of the woods, bathing. For the first time in centuries he was attempting to clean himself. His fairy companions buzzed around him excitedly, happy to be helping their Faun friend. Three of them were assigned to his hair, trying to clean and rid the mass of twigs and dead leaves, untangling knots as they went. Another three were constantly fetching him bars of soap, as his grooved hide seemed to eat the bars away in seconds. The water in the fountain was now a shade of bubbly brown, as years of grime detached its self from the male. Pan scrubbed at his flesh vigorously with a brush he had stolen from the palace kitchen. If it could remove charred crumbs out of a pot, it could remove the dirt out of all his cracks. With a grunt he took the brush violently to his hooves, they had actually managed to grow a healthy layer of moss. With every layer of dirt he removed, Pan started to realize just how bad his condition was. Somehow his bark had grown to cover most of his hooves. It looked like he didn't even have hooves, in their place he had roots. That bark would have to be removed. He ran a self-conscious hand over his hips, feeling all the jagged splinters. How could he possibly please Moanna if he cut her thighs as he lay between them? Worried now, he cautiously fingered the dead snapped off shoots protruding from his shoulders and spine. How could he lay in a bed if he tore the sheets and punctured the mattress? \"One of you,\" he addressed the fairies, \"go to the local carpenters, and find me some sandpaper, a file, a chisel, anything that can cut through this damned bark.\" Apparently all the fairies thought the mission sounded interesting, because he soon found himself alone in the fountain. \"I would be careful if they brought back a chisel.\" Pan's head shot up to find Moanna standing at the edge of the fountain clad only in her shift. \"What if you slipped and cut off something important?\" He stood quickly, in a jittery spasm. Dropping his brush and knocking the soap from the fountain's stone edge. \"Princess, what are you doing outside? It's midnight.\" Pan didn't need to look at the sky to tell what time it was. One of the advantages of being as old as him was that you knew the passage of time instinctively without feeling it. \"I couldn't sleep,\" she answered, stepping into the murky water, not caring how filthy it was, \"Someone left me a very nice drawing that has kept me awake all night. A drawing that reminded me of this place, so I decided to visit it.\" \"Someone, eh?,\" Pan replied as nonchalant as possible, \"I heard strange things have been happening lately,\" he said, feigning ignorance of his drawing. \"Yes, they have, like a Faun bathing for the first time in years,\" she giggled, \"Dare I ask, if it is for a beautiful lady suitor?,\" she smiled at him knowingly. Pan sniffed, raising his hoof in a grand display of removing a twig from the cleft. \"Why does a woman have to be behind my cleanliness? Perhaps I simply got tired of my own stench. I read somewhere recently that I smell like ash and wood burning in a hearth, and-\" \"Freshly tilled soil, fertile and rich,\" Moanna finished for him. Pan locked his eyes with hers, \"Memorized it all have you?\" She shook her head smiling, \"No, I'm merely reminded I wrote it every time you are near and I can breath you in.\" Pan took two hesitant steps closer to her, \"And are you also reminded of creaking stairs, and loose chairs every time I move?\" \"Liked that description did you?\" Pan shook his head, a chuckle escaping, \"Not as much as I enjoyed the description of when I do this.\" The Faun's whole body shuddered, twitching like he was having a nervous tick. He did this every time he got really frustrated, or she asked a question he had already answered several times before. The princess smiled, recognizing the signature move. \"As if you were a dog that had fur, or-\" \"A sleepy cat at the end of it's stretching,\" Pan finished. A silence fell over them, as their smiles slowly faded into nothing. Leaving them to stare at each other with searching eyes. \"Do you still find me childish?,\" she asked softly. \"No,\" Pan answered just as softly, \"Do you forgive me for saying all those cruel, unthinking words?\" The were both slowly wading towards each other through the brown water. \"Yes. Do you still deny the love I feel for you?\" Pan sighed heavily, throwing his head back to gaze at the stars. \"I am a very old goat, Princess,\" he said not looking at her, \"there are mountains younger than me, and oceans that were just trickles when I was born. You are far better off without this creaky old faun, but I will not push you away anymore. You have stolen all of my will to fend you off with your gifts. No, I will not deny you...Moanna.\" Her heart pounded in her chest at hearing her name spoken for the first time without her title attached to it. Hesitantly she reached for him. Bridging the gap between them, while he stood his ground. Her fingers touched his face lightly, and he leaned forward so all of her hand could follow. Closing his eyes as she traced the swirling patterns on his forehead. Soon her other hand came to cup his jaw, and the space between their bodies quickly dwindled. \"Will you let me tell you how much I love you now?,\" the princess whispered. Pan purred, nuzzling into her hands. \"You do not need too. I already know you love me, but I will never tire of hearing it.\" \"Good,\" she spoke, weaving her fingers into his wet hair, \"because I love you, Pan.\" Pan leaned forward and kissed her quickly, like a lightning strike or a rearing snake. The action ending as soon as it started when he pulled back. Moanna was having none of it. She had waited years to kiss the faun and it was not going to be so fleeting. Grabbing his horns tightly she pulled him back down and fused her mouth to his surprised one. Her tongue invading him, as she took from Pan all that she could. Running her tongue over the lengths of his crooked teeth, taking in his taste for the first time. Pan groaned mournfully as she plundered him, the sound ending in a keening whine. Moanna soon found herself pulled roughly against his hard chest, as he took back control of the moment. Weaving his splintered fingers into her hair, attacking the inside her mouth with his own tongue. Tasting her back in hurried sweeps, until they were both panting. Their mouths only breaking from each other to change the angle of assault, they clutched at each other with restless hands. \"Say it,\" Moanna moaned, between kisses. Pan defied her, saying nothing, kissing her violently in an attempt to divert her thinking. \"I need to hear you say it, Pan,\" she panted, digging her nails into the sodden bark of his shoulders. He kissed her roughly. \"You love me,\" he purred against her lips, smiling wickedly. Moanna gave a growl that rivaled the faun's, shoving her would-be-lover hard. Pan stumbled, his hooves slipping on the pebbled base of the fountain. He fell with flailing arms, splashing brown water everywhere, and drenching the Princess. Not deterred by the mess he made, Moanna followed him down, straddling his waist easily while he spluttered. Pushing the shocked Faun into the stone edge of the fountain. \"Say it Pan, you stubborn old goat. Say it, or I'll take a match to your kindling and set you alight.\" Pan barked a harsh laugh beneath her. Clasped her waist, and pulled her until she was flush against him below the murky water line. \"You forget, Moanna, that I have spent the past couple of days reading about just how much you love my kindling. Besides, you will have to wait for me to dry before setting me ablaze. It will give me plenty of time to flee.\" She pounded her fist hard into his chest, making his armored skin squeak. \"Say it, or I will never show you my kindling.\" As soon as the words left her moth, Pan's gaze dropped to front of her sodden, transparent shift. The laces barely holding the garment together, hiding nothing from view. \"But I can already see them, Love,\" he smiled wickedly. \"What was that?,\" Moanna asked, only focusing on the end of his sentence, ignoring the fact that she was exposed. Pan reached forward and with his spindly fingers tugged on the shifts ties. They came apart easily. The Princess gasped, raising her hands to cover her breasts. \"No, Love. Don't hide from me.\" Pan gently batted her hands away, as he gazed down at her flesh reverently. Not touching her, but creating enough sensation with his stare that the princess shivered. \"Say it,\" she whispered. Pan reached forward. This time to trace a fingertip over the shivering mound to it's hardened tip, making her whine softly, and push forward into his touch. \"I am not worthy,\" he breathed, moving his hand until it cupped her flesh. \"I am not worthy, but I still love you.\" Moanna fell on him, grasping his horns once more to kiss him hurriedly. Triumph thrumming through her body, she tore her mouth from his to shower his face in kisses. Pan purred under the attention, raising his other hand to cup her. He kneaded the flesh globes gently, delighting in the moans she gave, as her hardened peaks rubbed against his rough palms. Pan could feel his body start to sir under the water, and knew where this was quickly heading. Moanna released her death grip on his horns to rub his strange ears, teasing the delicate hairs on them. They were the softest part on his Faun body, and the most sensitive. Pan threw his head back growling, as his hips bucked instinctively beneath her. Moanna suddenly found herself underneath him, pressed against the stone wall as he loomed over her, brown water dripping from his armored hide. \"We must stop this now, Moanna. I refuse to take your maidenhead in a dirty fountain,\" he ignored the needy whine she gave at his words, \"When I finally claim you it will be in our marriage bed, under the sanction of the Gods and with the permission of your parents.\" \"You mean that?,\" she asked softly, hope shining in her eyes. They both knew what she was asking. Would he marry her now? After all of their confessions, would he wed her? \"Yes,\" he breathed. Moanna's smile was radiant as she lay beneath him. \"Then just let me kiss you, let me touch you. That's all I want before I have to return to my room. Just let me be with you here.\" Words had never sounded so sweet to the Faun. \"The night is young,\" Pan lowered his head to hers, watching as her lips parted for him in anticipation, \"We will share many kisses before the dawn, my Love.\" They came together with murky brown water swirling around them. Oblivious to everything except each other. A few meters away from them the fairies hid in a tree's leaves, giggling as they watched the scene unfold before them. Six of them were holding up a large metal file that they had liberated from the local blacksmiths. They knew better than to interrupt the two lovers, it had taken too long for them to get this far, and the fairies were happy to see them finally giving into their destiny. As they watched the two in the fountain, holding and rocking each other in a watery mating dance. The Princess clasped the faun's hand sucking his splintered, wooden finger into her mouth carefully, like it was the tastiest thing in the Underground. The fairies uncertainly looked down at the file they were holding, and giggled. Perhaps the Faun didn't need the file after all.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: don't own pan's labyrinth. Sorry about my extended absence. I have had a lot on my plate that I had to deal with. Also there is fan art for this fic....already. Just google A nouche-eleni to find her gallery on deviant art. Megumisakura: thanks. Queenofhearts: yes, the three big words, and knowing Pan he probably did enjoy her sneaking up on him. Unfortunately, they don't really date in this fic. It's more just them hanging around together. But if they did do a proper date I have no doubt that Pan would be his normal jittery (faun/treeman) self and mess it up. Ps: the fairies probably are voyeurs. Illegitimi: it has been my experience that men can be just as insecure as women, and they do get nervous before a date. As for you sexual innuendos...pan does give new meaning to morning wood. As for you saying that water is the best place for love I disagree,...everywhere is the best place for love. Deathbypickle: still love your name. LizzySkellington: I like you too. Witashnah: a lot of the people are only reading this because they liked Ooman so much. As for the movie, I always tend to take characters far away from their movie selves, so don't expect it to be anywhere similar. Nagasasu: yes, she has been quite rough with him throwing books and all. Good thing pan's made of wood. Ngoc Chau: ok. Firstmorningdew: lol, I agree. Anouche: this chapter is for you. Kittariku: give me time to get the length of the story going. But your Praises for this story are heartening, especially when it's only four chapters long so far. As for my characterization it's what I love best, taking what's there and doing more with it. Vampire Hunter D's Girl: I like hunter D too. Woahh it's molly: awkward and cute is what I aim for. Pan is an awkward character and I wanted to be true to his movie self, so I let him keep all of his oddness. He's more interesting to work with that way. LittleMargarita: thank you for the compliments, and this story is a bit more to go until it's finished. In the months that followed the late night rendezvous, the Princess and the Faun were inseparable. It was rare not to see them side by side as they courted each other openly. They had little care for those who watched them with confused eyes. Servants often came across the pair kissing in hallways, kissing in the gardens, kissing in her bedroom. Everywhere they could be found kissing, without a care for anyone who could see. They would have picnics in the gardens from time to time. Late at night it was not unusual to see them huddled together in the library. Reading books to each other in hushed whispers, like what they were speaking was of vital secrecy. Either Pan was at the palace, or Moanna would disappear into the woods. If you were looking for one they would be with the other. And then slowly over the months both of them, in their obvious love, began to change before the eyes of the court and the King. The princess was always smiling. Her skin seeming to glow as if lit from the inside, she literally shone. Her eyes would sparkle as she laughed far more easily these days. The once shy Moanna was now an outspoken woman, that would talk and tell jokes to the palace servants. Kiss the King and Queen on their cheeks, and would often exclaim about how wonderful the day was. Gone was their quiet Princess, but her transformation was not the one that made people stare. It was Pan's metamorphosis that drew gazes. Gradually his armored hide had begun to change color, from pale washed out grays and charcoals, to deep browns and burgundies. His hair was no longer dirty and lank, instead it had become a mass of blond waves that haloed his black horns. His horns had grown too, now far larger and more curled. In general he simply seemed to grow. His scrawny frame filling out until his chest was as impressive as his rounded flanks. His black hooves were now massive as they peaked from beneath his bark. They would clatter on the ground, like wood on a chopping block. His flesh had healed its self as well. The dry cracked surfaces now becoming a whole, so that when he walked he no longer creaked and popped. Instead his limbs now sounded like a trees groaning in wind, or vines being pulled tight. His movements became easier, his limping gate now a fluid stride. Even his milky eyes had cleared into a vibrant, startling blue. He was still impressive and handsome, the only difference was other people could now appreciate it. With maids giving the male second glaces when he passed. But there was one annoyance of his new form that Pan could do without. \"I never had to have this done before I became... healthy ,\" Pan grumbled with Moanna sitting behind him, carefully maneuvering a chisel. Green shoots and saplings had started to pop up along his back and shoulders. He could reach most of them but not all, for that he had to ask for his Beloved's help. \"I do not see why the fairies will not assist you with this,\" the princess said, pulling a green shoot with two leaves from the bark. \"They say they can't,\" Pan huffed, \"they say it is like killing a baby tree.\" Pan shook his head, sending his blond curls to fly. \"I am afraid that I will wake up one morning to find myself rooted in the ground.\" Moanna giggled behind him. \"I don't know. You could look quite nice planted in my garden.\" \"Cheeky wench,\" Pan smiled, using a term he never would have only months before, \"focus on your task, and tell me what has you so upset today.\" The princess froze in her delicate chiseling. \"How do you know I am upset?\" \"I can feel it. I can smell it in your scent, you can not hide what you are feeling from me any longer, Moanna. I know you too well.\" She sighed in resignation, and continued to uproot saplings. \"I overheard the maids talking about you.\" \"Oh?,\" Pan cocked his head to the side, not knowing where this was going. \"I did not like what they said.\" \"And what did they say?,\" Pan egged her on. \"They compared you to a ram getting ready for spring,\" she huffed, \"and said that you would be good for a rut.\" The faun burst out laughing, making his new joints moan with his huge guffaws. \"It's not funny,\" Moanna shouted, slapping his back, \"they shouldn't be talking about you like that. It made me...uncomfortable.\" The Princess would never admit she was jealous. \"Oh, Love,\" Pan said still chuckling and wiping a tear from his eye, \"Now you know how I felt standing in the shadows for years, listening to Fae men whisper about their appreciation for your form.\" \"Well, I do not like it,\" she huffed. \"Well, neither did I,\" he smiled. \"And you do not help matters-\" \"Oh?\" \"Yes, you strut around so much these days with your new... kindling . Your.... maleness is becoming far too apparent.\" Pan smiled wickedly. He was enjoying this conversation immensely. \"I am glad you are noticing my maleness , Love, but you only have yourself to blame for the changes in me. I did not know that I was going to turn into a walking fertility God.\" Moanna hit his back again, this time with a closed fist. \"I am not jesting, Pan,\" she was glad he couldn't see her blushing behind him, \"Your neater regions are becoming far too...large, and besides-\" she glanced down over his shoulder to the smooth but rounded apex between his thighs, where no sex could be seen, \"I haven't quite figured out where you hide it all,\" she mumbled. Moanna knew it was there somewhere. She had felt it bump against her in some of the more passionate times they had kissed, but it always seemed to magically disappear. Was it stored in his body somewhere? It looked like it was with the notable wooden bulge. Could he retract it? She didn't know. \"Ah,\" Pan smirked, \"I have to keep some secrets for our wedding night.\" Moanna smiled faintly, a storm cloud gathering over her mind with his jesting words. She paused again in her task, her head heavy with mixed emotions. \"What is it?,\" Pan asked immediately. \"What if there is no wedding? What if the baby is a girl?\" To her surprise the faun threw his horned head back to laugh heartily once more. \"Your father can not deny us now, Love. Can you not feel it around us? Taste it in the air? There is magic around us. My change did not simply happen, there are forces at work here far older than me. The Gods themselves have sanctioned our union. My transformation could not have happened without their blessing, and this your father knows and can't ignore.\" Now that Pan had said it, yes, Moanna could feel it. She had just been too caught up in her own happiness, and was too new to this world to notice. They were meant for each other. They were supposed to be husband and wife, and her father could not come between them even for the sake of his throne. But, it all sounded too perfect. \"So we will be together?,\" she asked, uncertainly. \"Forever, if my guess is correct,\" the faun smiled. Comforted with his words and the force she felt between them, Moanna returned to her task. Wedging the chisel between two pieces of bark to take a green seedling out by the roots. The plant came with crack, and she froze at what followed it. \"Are you in pain?,\" she asked, voice wavering. \"No,\" Pan asked sitting up straighter, \"Why? What has happened?\" \"You are bleeding.\" \"What! I can not bleed. I have no blood,\" the faun sounded surprised, but not panicked. \"I didn't say it was blood,\" the princess said fascinated. She brought her hand over his shoulder so he could see a viscous fluid on her fingertips. The sunlight caught on the liquid, making it shine a deep yellow. \"Sap,\" Moanna said, even though he knew what it was, \" you are bleeding sap.\" Pan started at the amber liquid in amazement. His body really was getting ready for the spring. But out of all the changes that had occurred in him, this one was the most spectacular. His very essence had changed because of his love for the Princess. \"Well, that certainly is a first\"[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: don't own pan's labyrinth special mentions: this chapter is a short but necessary one, so I have decided to give you all a double tap and release two chapters at once. This story is fast coming to a close and there is only one more chapter after these two to go. Queenofhearts: yes, he is. Moanna is going to have to declare him as private property to stop pesky tree huggers. Woahh it's molly: yes, this story really is lovey dovey because I wanted it to have a fair tail feel to it. Thank you for all the compliments. ShayLeigh: why, thank you. Ngoc Chau: Pan is just like in the movie, totally naked. Kyashii: wow, just wow. Looking at all the wonderful things you said I really have no idea how to respond to you, but thank you. I'm really glad you're enjoying my story this much, and I'm glad I could...inspire you I suppose. Feel free to keep in touch once this story is finished. Megumisakura: Ok. Yaoiguru: I myself enjoy man on man action...that's why I checked out your favorites, and you have good tastes in fic's. WaterLilly: thank you, I obviously enjoyed the movie also, but you flatter me, really. Anouche: rsfgyfh76rd8u that's what my coffee mug says back to you. Lol. Vampire Hunter D's Girl: ok. SethFC: I enjoy long winded reviews immensely, that's why I respond to all of them, gives people incentive to review and inflate my ego in the process. So thank you for your review, I enjoy odd pairings myself, which is why I write them into all of my fan fictions. Again, thanks for the compliments. Firstmorningdew: this chemical reaction may be a little extrem compared to others. Laurie: If I was being honest with you, I would say that the lack of good stories in the category was one of the reasons why I wrote this fic...little competition and I stand out. Sad, and self centered but true. I have also read the fic's you mentioned and know exactly what you mean. Ps: thank you. Pss: I was one of those bored students once. Good story ideas can come from an oppressive classroom. Moanna and Pan watched as the King paced up and down the hallway. His hands clasped behind his back, an expression of worry on his features. The Queen was in labor. Her cries of pain could be heard all over the palace, and all it's inhabitants had stopped whatever they were doing to wait with baited breath for the new baby's royal arrival. The princess sat clutching her Faun's hand tightly as they sat outside the Queen' chambers. She would jump with every cry her mother gave, terrible memories of a past life filling her with dread. \"Breath my Love,\" Pan whispered, nuzzling into her black hair, letting his blond mingle with it, \"Your mother will be fine, she is immortal.\" \"That does not mean she feels no pain,\" she winched. \"Yes, but it does mean that your thoughts of death are unnecessary.\" He could do that now, read her expression, smell her scent, and he knew her thoughts. She had learned to read him as well, but her sense of smell could not compete with his enhanced faun one. The months of courting had gone by so fast for both of them, in a blur of happiness and love. Pan had finally stopped growing and changing. His once reedy frame now fully filled out, with huge muscles hidden beneath his bark. His chest and flanks were very well accentuated. The last of his changing had actually occurred three weeks before, when Pan and the Princess had been kissing. One of his crooked teeth had come out. After calming a frantic Moanna, Pan had notice that all of his teeth were incredibly loose, and simply plucked them from his mouth, while a distraught princess watched. The next day a new set had grown in, an impressive set. Pan now had two very prominent fangs that could not be kept entirely in his mouth, the white tips peaking from beneath his lips. All his teeth were now sharp and gleaming white. It had taken the faun some time to learn how to talk around the new appendages properly. Pan was now without a doubt the most handsomely intimidating creature Moanna had ever laid eyes on. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime for both father and daughter, the cries from the bedroom ceased, and an exhausted physician exited to speak to the King quietly. Her father disappeared into the room just as the angry cries of an infant filled the air. Moanna refused to relax her hold on Pan. She knew that no matter what they were going to be together. Be married as husband and wife, but she wanted her parent's permission as well. She also wanted her father to have the heir he so desperately desired. Her parents deserved a son, and after already siring two daughters, their family needed a boy. Her father emerged again holding a very small bundle wrapped in white. He approached them slowly, his gaze focused on the tiny child. When he came to a stop, Pan and Moanna could see the infants small red face, it's eyes not even opened properly yet. \"Your mother is resting,\" her father whispered, rocking the child as it let out a gurgle, \"Would you like to come hold your new baby brother?\" Moanna unable to speak nodded her head while her eyes started to mist over. With a sniffle she took the precious bundle from her father, and instinctively started to rock her little brother. Pan watched all of this longingly, wanting the child Moanna held to be their own. \"I suspect you now have some planning to do,\" the King said, standing at the faun's side, watching his two children interact. \"Your Majesty?\" \"For the wedding,\" the King answered, \"that is, of course, if it is possible for you to know my daughter...Biblicaly speaking?\" Pan blanched, glad the Princess was too involved with the baby to hear. \"It is entirely possible, your Majesty.\" \"And also, of course,\" the King continued, \" if it is possible for you to provide me with grandchildren?\" \"If you asked me that nine months ago, your Majesty, I would not be too sure. But now I can say with certainty that it is highly likely we will give you grandchildren.\" \"Brilliant,\" the King smiled, and walked over to his daughter to take his son back. Moanna reluctantly released the child, and Pan went to her, pulling her into his embrace. Kissing her when she looked up at him in surprise. The King went to return the baby to it's cradle, only to pause half way down the hall. Turning to face the entwined couple. \"Oh, and Pan,-\" The faun broke the kiss to look at his monarch. \"I expect you to be fully clothed for the ceremony and reception,\" he gave a pointed look at the males crotch, \" Make sure to wear pants.\"[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: don't own pan's labyrinth, but I do own this plot. Special mentions: on to the wedding. The ceremony had been perfect. Short and simple. In the palace's largest garden they had pledged themselves to one another while the guests looked on. And it was amazing to see just who had come out to join the unlikely couple on this happy day. There was the nobles of the court, of course, the elegant Fae in all their finery. But Pan had lived a very long time, and made friends with the most obscure and rare of creatures. Who had also come out to join the celebration. Crawling from their caves, hauling themselves from their burrows and rivers. Journeying out of their woods for the first time in centuries. There were Griffins, Centaurs, Goblins, Brownies, Changelings, Shape shifters, Trolls, Satyrs, Pixies, and of course Fairies just to name a few. And when it came time for the reception, all these creatures came together over food for the first time in centuries. The wine flowed freely, and there was ale close at hand. Making all the creature's tongues loose, and their dispositions merry. The result was nothing short of amusing for the newly wed couple sitting at their table of honor. Feeding each other bits of food, while drinking from each others goblets. \"Your Fae cousin is molesting my friend, Arrow,\" Pan whispered to his bride. Moanna looked out over the sea of faces and sure enough her fair Fae cousin, only just coming of age, was attempting to stroke the large Centaur's chestnut flanks discreetly, and the large male was loving it. Casting appraising glances over his shoulder at the beautiful female. \"I'm sure her mother would be very scandalized,\" Moanna whispered back, \"if she wasn't herself molesting a River Troll.\" Pan looked around for the Princess's Aunt, and found her on the crowded dance floor. Wrapped tightly around said Troll, Jimarnn, if he remembered correctly. They actually made a striking couple with his pale blue skin, and her golden blond hair. Both of them looked content as could be, swaying with one another. Their eyes closed, as they murmured things into each other's ears. \"That is nothing\", Pan spoke, leaning closer to her, \" take a look at the table to Knossos. This is the first time the beast has ever left his maze, and you can see he is not regretting it.\" Moanna did as Pan suggested, and looked at the fearsome Minotaur. The creature was not one to be trifled with. The beast was massive with long, dirty, pale gray fur, and wickedly sharp horns. But wonders never seemed to cease this night, because the male was being heavily doted upon by a very busty serving maid. She was constantly fetching him tankards of ale. And when the beast drooled because his jaggeder teeth could not fit into his mouth, the wench would take her apron and gently wipe it away. It was almost heartwarming to see the creature stare at the woman with awe in his large cloudy eyes. \"Is that a dog over there?,\" Moanna suddenly asked, spotting the animal sniffing around a group of maids. \"No, that is Bernard,\" Pan snorted, \"a shape shifter.\" The Princess nodded just as the dog decided to turn into a lion, with a large golden mane. The maids took one look at the giant cat and gasped. It was impossible for the shifter to hide his maleness in this form, and it was obvious he found the sight of the women very stimulating. \"What is in this wine?,\" Pan asked, staring into his goblet suspiciously. \"I don't know,\" Moanna leaned into his side, \"but it is very liberating.\" A light touch on his thigh alerted Pan to the fact that somehow, while he was taking in the sights of the wedding reception, his bride had managed to weave her hand into his red and gold robes. And was now unlacing the loose slacks he wore underneath. \"Careful, Love,\" Pan whispered in her ear, \"your father might see.\" Not deterred in the least, Moanna started to stroke the rounded bulge between the male's thighs. \"My father took my tired mother to bed hours ago,\" Moanna purred, \"That is how my little sister had time to sneak into the reception in her night gown. Your furred Satyr cousins are entertaining her.\" Sure enough the ten year old Princess was dancing among a group of the small fauns not much bigger than her. One even had pipes to his mouth, as he played for the girl. Skipping around her in circles. \"Satyr's are very good with children. How the short creatures mange to father so many of them I'll never know,\" Pan stuttered, knowing he was babbling. The wine had obviously made his bride bold, and his body was heeding her call under her persistent ministrations. He could feel his member growing, making it's self know. And her palm was there waiting to catch it, stroke him. Tease him. \"Do you think our guests will notice if we disappear?,\" she asked, softly nipping his ear. Pan looked around with unseeing eyes, at the drunken, merry making orgy. The gentry pairing off with the more bestial inhabitants of the Underground. He dimly noted a group of witches cackling away with a group of Lycan's in human form. The males howling with laughter along side them. The bodies on the dance floor were not so much dancing anymore, as they were swaying and grinding on one another. The court room had somehow during the night turned into a den of iniquity,... and none of the occupants seemed to care. \"No, no one will see if we disappear.\" \"Then let us disappear, Husband.\" As discreetly as possible the couple left the drunken celebration to escape into a nearby hallway. Moanna giggled as she tugged on Pan's hand, pulling him along as they ran. They kept running, and slowly the fog his bride had created over his mind started to clear. Pan realized they were running in the wrong direction. \"Moanna, our Marriage suite is in the west tower.\" \"I know that,\" the Princess giggled, \"Our marriage bed tonight will not be in the castle.\" They burst through a door at the back of the palace, and a confused Pan watched as his wife started to strip out of her golden wedding dress. Giggling like a nymph the entire time. \"What are you about bride?,\" he asked amused, not feeling it necessary to stop her from undressing. \"I have been reading,\" she explained, \" about ancient traditions of Faun's, and how their wedding ceremonies were practiced.\" Moanna stepped out of her dress. Wearing only her corset and shift, she started to back away from her new husband, kicking off her shoes. \"You could not possibly mean to....,\" Pan trailed off, eyes wide as it dawned on him what his wife intended to do. It was an ancient tradition, one that he had not seen practiced for centuries because it was considered too beastly. When he was young it had been the only way a Faun would consummate their union, and now Moanna was willing revive the old tradition...for him. And this faun was more then willing to comply. \"Catch me, Pan!,\" Moanna screamed, taking off into the woods. His woods. Pan smiled wickedly, and tore off his robes. Not caring when they ripped. He took his time unlacing his pants. Giving the woman the time to flee, she would need it. In his usual nakedness he strutted to the edged of the woods, his heart thrumming with anticipation. Crouching down he buried his hands in the soil feeling the earth, connecting with it. Feeling the life ebb and flow beneath his hands. A physical force all on it's own. He took a deep breath in, catching his woman's scent in the air. It teased all of his senses priming his body for the rut. Pan threw back his head and roared into the night. He charged into the woods, the trees moving out of his way, knowing that he was there, and aiding him in his hunt. This was his forest, and this was his Mate. Pan was going to enjoy the chase.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: don't own pan's labyrinth. Special mentions: well this is the end folks. And I hope you have all enjoyed the ride as much as I have. I also ask that you bask in the only finished story that I have ever written. Would you believe that this story was originally going to be a oneshot? Anyway, enjoy. Caution: Smex ahead. Ginstar: hey babe, I see you found my other story. BlackBaccaraRose: ok Yaoiguru: I have been slowly going through your favorites...there are soooo many. Anouche: it's not sad, it's amazing. My first complete fic. It's very rare. Ngoc Chau: you'll see. Ssjrem: thank you. Megumisakura: ok Nagasasu: I had a dream about the minotaur and just had to include him. Enjoy the chase. Illegitimi: I hope that this chapter was worth the wait for you. I do take my smex scenes very seriously. Vampire Hunter D's girl: why thank you. Enjoy the ending. LizzySkellington: lol, thank you kyashii: Yes, there will be consummating ahead enjoy. I shall miss reading your kick ass reviews to all of my chapters. Some of your reviews made my day, so it is with a heavy heart that I give you the ending. Ps: how can blanched be a favorite word? One of my fav's is splendiferous (thank you Mr Wonker). Anyway, enjoy the smexing. Moanna burst into a clearing, her lungs screaming in her confining corset. She clawed the garment off hurriedly, and thew it to the ground. She was a mess. Her hair that was once pinned up was now in tangles, full of leaves and twigs. Her shift was dirty and torn in several places. Her feet ached, and she had only been running for ten minutes. The very forest seemed to be conspiring against her. Roots would pop up to trip her constantly, and..... She was loving it. Her blood was pumping through her veins like it never had before. Adrenalin and excitement sent her whole body into shivers. She could feel herself burning, and she knew she was more then wet between her thighs. Just then she could hear Pan howl into the night. Every time he did this she felt compelled to answer it, and now she was too far gone to resit the urge. Throwing back her head, she sent her own cry into the night. It mingled with his own, desperate and pleading. As soon as it ceased she knew he was coming to her, following her call. Moanna quickly scrambled behind a tree, so she could watch the clearing hidden behind it's massive trunk. She half expected the tree to move, but it didn't. It stayed still, letting her clutch at it's bark. It didn't take long for Pan to burst into the clearing in a thunder of hooves, and the Princess had to remind herself to breath. Pan was stunning. His towing frame looked larger and more intimidating in the moonlight. His chest heaved, and his muscles twitched. His eyes glowed an iridescent blue as he looked into the surrounding darkness, but it was not his eyes that truly drew her gaze. It was the flesh between his legs. It stood proud and erect. Fully engorged and ready for her. Moanna felt herself clench in response to the sight, and had stifled a whimper, biting her tongue. Pan's eye honed in on her discarded corset, and he purred happily at the sight. Ears twitching, he breathed in the thick night air, searching for his mate's trail and found it easily. With a growl he looked straight at her. Saw her small face peaking out from behind a tree. They both froze. Neither moved as they stared into each other's eyes. Very slowly Pan started to lower himself into a crouch, and Moanna tensed. Ready to spring away at the slightest movement. \"Run!,\" Pan barked, and Moanna took off. She ran for all that she was worth. Limbs pumping as fast as she could make them. Pan hot on her tail. His hooves thundering behind, spurring her on. The trees were moving freely now, lining themselves up tightly, so the Princess could only run in a straight line. The forest was leading her somewhere, and she knew better then not to follow. Pan was just behind her, she could feel his huffing breaths on her neck. Feel his hands swipe at her shoulders, just missing her every time. And then she fell. Tripping over her own feet and into a moonlit clearing. She screamed instinctively, tumbling onto thick layers of grass. Pan fell behind her, grabbing her by the waist and rolling her with him, he slammed her into the grass, and was above her before she could blink. With one thrust the faun entered her. Breaking through her maidenhead, and rocking her whole body. Moanna screamed, as if he was killing her. Tears poured from her eyes at the sudden pain. Pan froze, her cry bringing him to his senses, and breaking through his mating haze. \"No!,\" he howled in anguish, gathering her to him. \"No, Love, no,\" he whispered into her hair, his own tears falling. He wrapped his arms around her tightly, sitting up with her in his lap as she wept. Rocking her back and forth. \"No pain,\" he murmured fiercely, \"no pain here.\" He showered her face with kisses. Nuzzling into her hair, desperately trying to sooth the hurt he had caused. He told her of her beauty, of his love for her. Begged her to forgive him. Stayed as still as possible in her, so she could adjust, and slowly she stopped weeping. Relieved, the Faun simply rocked her. Whispering endearments in long dead languages to her, hoping he could fix this. But he didn't have too. Sniffling, Moanna gave an experimental thrust in his lap. Making Pan moan, and close his eyes in pleasure. The pain was gone, and just to be sure she did it again. Thrusting against him gently. With care this time, Pan laid the Princess back on the grass. Hovering above her. Hesitant of crushing her with his weight, and began to thrust slowly in and out of her. In easy, measured glides he filled her. Letting her take his length at her leisure. Ignoring the howling voice in the back of his head telling him to dominate her. This was her first time. It wasn't about him it was about her, and Pan would be damned before he hurt his Mate like that again. Beneath him Moanna panted, as new sensations surrounded her. She could smell him as he moved above her slowly. Filling her with every inch of him, over and over, at a steady pace. His blond hair fell over his shoulders on to her. Curtaining her face and tickling her breasts, as he hunched forward. Surrounding her in a halo of gold. He was watching her face intently, making sure there was no pain. Moanna reached for him, as he stared down at her. Grabbing his horns, and pulling him to her. She kissed him hard, and Pan groaned, his hips snapping on reflex. She cried out and Pan froze again, not wanting to hurt her. \" No, do it again ,\" she hissed, grabbing his ears and tugging on them. Pan complied, slamming in to her again. Recognizing her cry of joy this time. He did it again, purring when her hands came up to grip his shoulders. Another hard thrust sent her nails into his flesh, and then Pan let loose. Slamming into her hard and fast, like his instincts told him too. Rocking her into the thick grass with every thrust. Delighting in her cries of pleasure. Snarling like a beast, as he finally claimed her properly. Fusing their flesh together, in hurried movements that even he couldn't stop. Moanna moved with him, meeting his every thrust with a counter one. Planting her feet and raising her hips off the ground, so she could move with as much force as he did. Letting her hands fall from him, she griped the grass below them. Tearing it up from the roots, clawing at it. Sending it's fresh smell in to the air to mingle with the scent of sex. \" More ,\" she panted, \" I want more .\" Pan pulled from her, and Moanna cried in anguish at the loss. Only to find herself quickly flipped. The faun pushing her face to the ground, and her hips into air. Moanna screamed her pleasure as he entered her again from behind. The angle deeper, the position more open. He picked an even faster pace. Thrusting into her violently, as she muffed her cries in the thick grass. She clawed huge patches of the grass away as he took her. Her hands trying to find purchase in the brown soil, as he rocked her body forward gripping at her hips tightly. When her hands were buried wrist deep in the ground, holding her still, Moanna thrust back into him just as viciously. Pan howled in pleasure. Surging forward into his Mate like the animal he was. Smelling her ripe scent in the air. Listening to her desperate cries as he pleased her. He had to mark every inch of her as his. Let everyone know she belonged to him and no other. Heeding the call that he couldn't control, Pan leaned forward and buried his teeth into the back of her neck. Snarling, as he tasted her blood on his tongue. Completing the ceremony, and binding them together. The woman froze instinctively under his bite. A long drawn out wail leaving her as she could do nothing but shudder uncontrollably. Her body climaxed around him, gripping his flesh tightly. Wanting to move against him so badly, but being held still. Pan tore his mouth from her throat. Feeling her body milk his. Gripping and tugging him deeper into her womb, as she trembled around him. He came in a monstrous roar. Flinging his head back he bellowed victoriously at the stars, as he filled her full of his essence. Leaving his seed deep inside of her quivering body. Together they fell forward onto the ground. Panting and exhausted, still joined. Pan not wanting to crush her, carefully rolled them onto their sides. Still softly thrusting into her, as aftershocks shook them both. Moaning every time her body would clench him with it's own slight pulses. No words were needed as they held each other. They both knew they loved each other. Both knew this was only the first of many future couplings. But the Princess couldn't let her husband not know how much he had pleased her. \"That was perfect,\" she breathed, reaching back to rub his flank. \"No it wasn't,\" Pan chuckled, holding her tightly to him, \"It wasn't perfect, but it was real, and that's all that matters.\" Moanna hummed her agreement, and closed her eyes. The faun had worn her out. Behind her Pan also closed his eyes. He would need rest if he wanted to take her again before dawn. Together they fell asleep, surrounded by a perfect circle of trees. Meanwhile, back at the palace the celebration was finally coming to a close. The guests starting to disperse. Heading back to their respective homes. If one bothered to look closely they could find a Fae leading a Centaur into a secluded part of the royal gardens. Neither knowing that their seed would take root that night. Causing a controversy that would last for several centuries. But the Fae's mother could say nothing against her daughter, as her own womb would also bare fruit. The royal being taken behind the abandoned orchestra, and introduced to the ways of Trolls. And if one looked particularly hard ,they could spot a ghostly Minotaur sneaking into the servant's quarters. To steal a sleeping maid from her bed, and carry her back to his labyrinth. Not knowing that he too was about to undergo his own transformation, not unlike the faun Pan. Yes, there was much love to be had in the Underground that night, as outdated rules on courtship were being broken. Smashed upon the noble Fae's superiority. The Underground was going to be a far more exciting place from now on. A place were Princesses do marry fauns. And this was only the beginning. fin. love to all those who reviewed.","LastChapter":"Disclaimer: don't own pan's labyrinth. Special mentions: well this is the end folks.

Anyway, enjoy the smexing. Moanna burst into a clearing, her lungs screaming in her confining corset. She clawed the garment off hurriedly, and thew it to the ground. She was a mess. Her hair that was once pinned up was now in tangles, full of leaves and twigs. Her shift was dirty and torn in several places. Her feet ached, and she had only been running for ten minutes. The very forest seemed to be conspiring against her. Roots would pop up to trip her constantly, and..... She was loving it. Her blood was pumping through her veins like it never had before. Adrenalin and excitement sent her whole body into shivers. She could feel herself burning, and she knew she was more then wet between her thighs. Just then she could hear Pan howl into the night. Every time he did this she felt compelled to answer it, and now she was too far gone to resit the urge. Throwing back her head, she sent her own cry into the night. It mingled with his own, desperate and pleading. As soon as it ceased she knew he was coming to her, following her call. Moanna quickly scrambled behind a tree, so she could watch the clearing hidden behind it's massive trunk. She half expected the tree to move, but it didn't. It stayed still, letting her clutch at it's bark. It didn't take long for Pan to burst into the clearing in a thunder of hooves, and the Princess had to remind herself to breath. Pan was stunning. His towing frame looked larger and more intimidating in the moonlight. His chest heaved, and his muscles twitched. His eyes glowed an iridescent blue as he looked into the surrounding darkness, but it was not his eyes that truly drew her gaze. It was the flesh between his legs. It stood proud and erect. Fully engorged and ready for her. Moanna felt herself clench in response to the sight, and had stifled a whimper, biting her tongue. Pan's eye honed in on her discarded corset, and he purred happily at the sight. Ears twitching, he breathed in the thick night air, searching for his mate's trail and found it easily. With a growl he looked straight at her. Saw her small face peaking out from behind a tree. They both froze. Neither moved as they stared into each other's eyes. Very slowly Pan started to lower himself into a crouch, and Moanna tensed. Ready to spring away at the slightest movement. \"Run!,\" Pan barked, and Moanna took off. She ran for all that she was worth. Limbs pumping as fast as she could make them. Pan hot on her tail. His hooves thundering behind, spurring her on. The trees were moving freely now, lining themselves up tightly, so the Princess could only run in a straight line. The forest was leading her somewhere, and she knew better then not to follow. Pan was just behind her, she could feel his huffing breaths on her neck. Feel his hands swipe at her shoulders, just missing her every time. And then she fell. Tripping over her own feet and into a moonlit clearing. She screamed instinctively, tumbling onto thick layers of grass. Pan fell behind her, grabbing her by the waist and rolling her with him, he slammed her into the grass, and was above her before she could blink. With one thrust the faun entered her. Breaking through her maidenhead, and rocking her whole body. Moanna screamed, as if he was killing her. Tears poured from her eyes at the sudden pain. Pan froze, her cry bringing him to his senses, and breaking through his mating haze. \"No!,\" he howled in anguish, gathering her to him. \"No, Love, no,\" he whispered into her hair, his own tears falling. He wrapped his arms around her tightly, sitting up with her in his lap as she wept. Rocking her back and forth. \"No pain,\" he murmured fiercely, \"no pain here.\" He showered her face with kisses. Nuzzling into her hair, desperately trying to sooth the hurt he had caused. He told her of her beauty, of his love for her. Begged her to forgive him.

It just jumped outnat me when I saw the movie repeated on Sky for like the 15th time. It'snMissy/Jan with and touch of Jan/Courtney and Cliff/Torrance. Please reviewnso I want to write more as I think this could be a series! Torrance and Cliff were obvious from the beginning. From the moment theynmet there was a connection, a vibe, a something. A something that wasnobvious from the moment he held the door open, to the first football gamenhe made it to in his life, from the guitar wolf whistle, to the hours henspent making her a tape. It was obvious, expected, and I felt littlensurprise when he finally turned up in Florida and cheered us (though it wasnblatantly more for her) on. I asked both of them, different times of course, but I asked. And man, hownfar into denial were they? I mean it's a river in Egypt, not a waterfallnor an inland sea or whatever. But anyway, as I was saying, it was Cliff and Torrance were obvious.nPredictable. Jan and I, well, that kinda blindsided me. And Jan. And Courtney.nBasically everyone. I'm not sure when it started. There was a vibe, and then there wasn't.nHe's complimenting me, then he's telling me how his fingers just slipnsometimes. When he held me in the air his fingers never slipped. At timesnhe nearly dropped me, but his fingers never slipped anywhere. I never bentnover to give him a view of my ass, I never gave him a show, never shovednhim up against a wall and - Nevermind. No, I don't want to talk about it. No, I don't. I won't. Well it was that damn car wash. Yeah, the \"guys ogling my goodies\" carnwash. The making money to pay Sparky car wash. Damn Sparky. But that's andifferent rant. This one's the car wash. The bikini-clad-water-fighting-car wash. The Courtney and Jan against a Chevy car wash. When he hits her with water and she shrieks and chases him with a sponge.nWhen he laughs as the water soaks her suit, and she threatens him with ancertain look in her eyes. And he backs her into a car with the hose andnmove in on her and they seem to be about a second away from making a pornnstar blush when Les dumps a bucket of suds over Jan and he's suddenly moreninterested in assuaging his male pride with his best friend than screwingnhis almost girlfriend against a Chevy. I could add more details but what would be the point. It's the past. From my point of view history started after the California StatenChampionships. After the Torrance Vs. Courtney & Whitney showdown. Whennthe gauntlet was thrown. When it was me and Les against everyone else. \"Why'd you do that?\" And I'm turning. Very quickly. And holding the towel around my chest.nVery tightly. \"What?\" I'm eloquent when I'm in shock. He leans back against a locker. \"So this is what the Girl's Locker Room looks like.\" He's grinning at me.n\"It smells better than ours.\" \"I wouldn't know.\" Just call me ice; I'm totally chilled. I'm not at allnfreaked out about the fact that I'm wearing nothing but a towel and talkingnto Jan. \"I've never seen 'em.\" \"These're better,\" he shrugs, \"trust me.\" \"I do.\" He grins. \"You do what?\" \"I trust you.\" I turn away to start drying off. \"I kinda have to. Younthrow me in the air on a regular basis.\" I'm not looking, I'm not looking.n I'm just drying off. I am in no way curious to see if he's checking menout. \"I don't,\" he says. \"Huh?\" \"I don't throw you anywhere. Steve lifts you. Torrance paired me withnCourtney.\" \"Right.\" I pull on my jeans under the towel. Least I'm not naked anymore \"Right.\" There's something in his tone, something I'm not sure I want tonhear. I've almost got my bra on and I don't want to think about what henmight be saying. \"So.\" \"So,\" I reply. I'm done with the towel now and pulling a top over my headnand. And - And it's stuck on something. Dammit. Why does this always happen to me! Why! I was so close to Ice Princess Inhad chill blains and now - NOW - I've got my top stuck over my head, mynarms trapped and my chest visible to the world. The world, that right now,nincludes Jan. Jan. \"Jan?\" \"Yeah?\" Shit. He's still here. He's still watching. He's - Wait. Why's he not laughing? Cliff laughs at everything. Cliff's probably off laughing right now coznhis sister's on a Cheerleading Squad. Probably having a ball with just thenthought of it. Of me. He'd be in hysterics if he could see me now. Sonwould Les. Probably. He'd laugh it up. But Jan's not laughing. He's just watching me. Suddenly I can feel mynskin burning. \"You're not laughing.\" \"No.\" I struggle a bit more to get lose. \"You're blushing\" he says, finally. \"Am I?\" It's a weak shot, but I'm just hoping - \"Yeah\". Even with my eyes covered I can feel him move closer. \"Jan, I -\" \"Shh.\" His finger brushes my lips. \"Don't.\" \"Jan?\" \"Do you trust me?\" I can feel his breath against the back of my neck. \"Yeah.\" My voice shakes a little \"Then trust me.\" His hands are in my hair, gently untangling locks still wet from thenshower. He takes his time, moving slowly, but I can feel the heat of hisnbreath on my skin as it speeds up. He runs his hands through my hair, andnsuddenly this has nothing to do with cheerleading or winning or evenngetting out of this bind I'm in. This is purely about touch. And he touches me. Running his fingertips down my arms so gently it's asnif he never quite hits skin, just brushes along past my elbows with thisnfeather-light touch that causes my breath to catch in my throat. His hands reach my shoulders, and I let him turn me to face him, as onenhand rises to drift along the edge of my jaw. The other slips down past mynbreasts to caress the skin of my stomach, then slips around my waist as hensteps in close. His breath warms my lips now as I shiver in his embrace. We're so close -nso close - as his hand reaches round behind my head, pulling my mouthntowards his and - His hand frees my shirt from the clasp of my necklace and I'm free. I hesitate, and in the second it takes me to pull my shirt down and make andecision to kiss the boy now, he's back leaning against the lockers as ifnnothing had happened. \"So,\" he says, and something inside me grins as I register that he's tryingnto disguise the fact he's breathing hard. \"So,\" I reply, trying to keep my voice as neutral as possible. \"What was all that about? In the Gym.\" \"Huh?\" I'm pretty sure we're in the Locker Room. The Gym, what Gym? \"The showdown with Courtney and Whitney. You and Les.\" Oh that Gym. \"That was, well. You were there, right?\" \"Yeah. You and Les, your show of support.\" I shrug. \"I was right wasn't I. We're gonna stick by Torr, go over to Florida andnwin.\" \"I know, it's just, I don't know. I thought you trusted me.\" \"I do.\" I falter, \"I mean, we just -\" He dismisses my words with a gesture. \"If you trusted me you'd have told me.\" \"I do trust you.\" Okay that sounded plaintive even to me. \"You don't. You just dismissed me. Like only you and Les can have anconscience about this shit.\" I don't know what to say because if I'm being totally honest, he's kindanright. \"We just thought that given you and\" - must say her name without hatred -n\"Courtney, you'd already chosen, like, a side in this.\" \"Courtney.\" He says it without emotion - like it's just another word. \"I'm sorry Jan,\" I'm floundering, sinking in the deep water, \"We didn'tnthink you - \" \"Courtney,\" he says again. \"And her spanky pants\" I try, going for the cheap laugh at the blondenbitch's expense. \"Courtney.\" I'm on a level so far beyond uncomfortable right now that it's not true.nFifteen minutes ago he was watching me dress, five minutes back he wasnwriting his name with his fingers across my skin and this close - thisnclose - to kissing me. And now? Now we're talking about his damn almostngirlfriend. I look away. I just can't stand it anymore. \"Missy.\" I can't help but notice that he whispers my name with a hell of anlot more emotion that hers. \"I don't think you're allowed in here\" I say, staring at the floor. \"Missy.\" He's stepping closer again, his hands reaching out for me. I step back. \"Just go.\" It's barely above a whisper, and I'm not looking but I can hearnhis retreat. I glance up in time to see him standing at the door, myriadnemotions playing across his features. And then he's gone. And the door swings closed behind him. After a moment I start to pack up my things, wrap up my towel and dirtynpractice clothes, throw toiletries into my bag. I already know I'm notngoing to tell anyone about this, not Torrance, not Les and certainly notnCliff. If I don't tell anyone, it didn't happen. I walk out of the Locker Room, carrying my bag, holding my head high.nNothing happened today. I didn't just let a guy I like touch my skin butnleave before he kisses me. I didn't just bring up his semi-girlfriendnafter the event. I didn't savour every tiny touch of his hands and thenwarmth of his breath of my skin. Nothing happened just now. Nothing at all. Now if only my skin would stop tingling.[Chapter 2] Predictable Maybe it was predictable. Me guy, her girl. Despite the constant ribbingnfrom the football losers I know that the general perception in school isnthat we get some. That we get a lot. That the girls are our playthings,nor would that be another way around.? Every now and then I hear rumours, stories, about our conquests. About thenthreesome Aaron had with Courtney and Whitney, about Big Red's bitches andnDarcy's boy toys. I overhear snippets of conversation between classes,ncomments made in the locker room and occasional insult aimed at mynsexuality. They've paired me with Whitney, Darcy and Carver on occasion. Big Rednbroke me in for the team and Torrance used me to get captain. Courtneynregularly abuses me for sexual favors and I stole Casey's virginity (whichnis, as far as I know still in existence) from her. But they're nevernlinked me with Missy. No one's ever linked me with Missy. They're linked Missy with Torrance and even with Les (which is just crazyncoz that boy is about as straight as a circle), but never with me. So I'm thinking about this. And I'm thinking about the way her skin feltnunder my fingertips and the way she shook so gently at my touch. Andnthinking about the look in her eyes and line of her lips. I'm thinking about all of this. At the worst possible time. \"What you thinking?\" Courtney snuggles up against me with the popcorn. She's got her hair tiednup, a few tendrils curling against the nape of her neck. My arms aren'tnaround her, they're stretched along the back of the coach and for the firstntime ever I'm wondering if I shouldn't be somewhere else entirely. \"Jan?\" She leans in, loose strands of her hair tickle my skin as she moves.n \"You in there?\" She grins as she closes in, a flirtatious look in herneyes. But it's always been like this. We flirt and joke and make out and that'snit. That's all it's ever been. We tease and taunt and touch. We kiss andncaress and what. I can't remember if we ever talked. She's kissing my neck, teasing the skin with her lips. And I'm justnsitting here. I want her. I always want her. And physically she's prettynmuch perfect. Physically I can feel myself responding to her touch. Butnmentally, mentally I'm not even here. I'm in a locker room, the girl's locker room. And this brunette with annattitude is completely unable to help herself out of this bind she's in.nHelpless for the first time since I met her. And ever so gently I'mntouching her skin. Courtney's licking my neck and unbuttoning her shirt. She doesn't evennnotice I'm not here. The t-shirt I was wearing has already been thrownnacross the floor sometime when I wasn't paying attention, and she's takingnfull advantage of that. I wonder when she's gonna notice I'm not here. I wonder if she'll notice I'm not here. So I'm just sitting here, while Courtney plays seductress and writhes abovenme. And I'm responding. Somehow, without any involvement of my brain, the two of us have progressednpast most of the stages of foreplay. And I'm looking up at this girl.nThis blonde, beautiful naked girl who wants me. Who wants me right now. I stare up at her as she grins down at me. She's got that look in herneyes. That passionate teasing look. That look that says exactly whatnshe's about to do. I bite my lip as she slides off my lap. \"Courtney?\" I ask. \"Yes Jan,\" she replies, sitting from the floor. I don't want her to do this. I want her and I don't. I don't. \"Don't\" I manage. She cocks her head. \"Don't what?\" \"Can't we just, I don't know, talk?\" She raises her eyebrows. \"Talk.\" \"Yeah.\" There's a pause. \"You're kidding, right?\" \"No,\" I say, \"I'm not.\" She's standing now, leaning in over me. \"You know,\" she says, \"it's so sweet that you think of me. But I don'tnmind, you can make it up to me later.\" I blink. When did we get here? When did whatever relationship we havenbecome a series of \"making it up to each other\" sessions. \"You know what,\" she says, \"I have an idea, but we can't stay here.\" \"Yeah?\" It's not nearly as enthusiastic as my usual response to her ideas.n Her ideas that generally involve nights in her bed, and handcuffs andnmelted ice cream places it really shouldn't be. \"I'll be waiting for you.\" She says as she strips off what's left of hernclothing. \"Come upstairs in just a minute, and I'll be waiting.\" And I'm left here, on the coach, with my body reacting to the memories ofnher last idea, while my mind tells me I shouldn't sleep with whatever shenis to me while all I can think about is this afternoon, in the girls lockernroom, with Missy. Missy. Missy. Before I know what I'm doing I've fumbled my cell out of the pocket of mynjacket and tapped in her number. And it's ringing. \"What's up?\" \"Missy?\" There's a silence. \"Jan.\"n\"Missy, I -\" What is it I'm supposed to say right now? I'm half naked atnCourtney's and I'm about to go up to her room but I just wanted to talk tonyou. I've got this girl offering to fulfill my fantasies upstairs and allnI can think about is how you reacted when I touched you this afternoon. \"Missy, I -\" I want you. I want to be going upstairs to your room. \"CannI come over?\" Woah. Where did that come from? \"Missy I - \" Did I actually just say that out loud. \"Are you stillnthere?\" \"I'm here.\" Her voice is flat, emotionless even. \"Missy, I -\" \"It's late Jan.\" \"Yeah it is.\" \"I'll be in tomorrow.\" She'll be in tomorrow. \"I'll come round.\" And she's gone. Hung up on me. I sink into the sofa with a smile on my face. Tomorrow can't come soonnenough. I rest my head back against the cushions. Tomorrow. I must have dozed off because suddenly I'm kissing someone. Or beingnkissed. Or both. I moan slightly as I push my hands into her hair,npulling her closer, deepening the kiss. We duel with our mouths and I letnmy hands drift down to naked - naked! - shoulders. The shock makes my eyes fly open. And I'm taken aback at the sight of blond, not dark, hair. \"Courtney?\" \"Hey Lover, who're you expecting?\" Missy. \"You.\" \"Come on Lover\" she says, pulling me to my feet. \"Let's go upstairs.\" \"Courtney,\" I start, \"we should talk.\" \"We can talk after,\" she says as she drags me across the room. \"Now comenon.\" We can talk after. Except we can't because she'd kill me. And Missy. Andnwe can't afford this right now. We need to be in sync, we need to be inntune. I can't screw around here. Not this close to the Nationals. \"After.\" \"Yeah,\" she says, \"after.\" I'm trying not to think about what I'm doing. I'm not betraying Missy because, well because there's nothing there. Yet. I'm doing this for the team. And myself. I'm not doing this to Missy. Courtney grabs my belt and pulls me into her room, with that look in herneyes. I can't believe I'm turning into that guy, that guy who thinks of one girlnwhile sleeping with another. I'm turning into that guy. I don't want tonbe that guy. I don't want to be here. I shut the door behind me. Maybe if I keep my eyes closed.[Chapter 3] Expected By Redtoes \"Okay,\" I admit, \"I'm confused.\" \"Really Les,\" Missy mutters, \"Then imagine how I feel right now.\" Abruptlynshe drops onto the stool in front of her vanity table and yanks a brushnthrough her hair. I roll over on the bed, and stare up at the ceiling. \"So,\" I say trying to get this situation straight, \"you like him.\" \"No!\" She slams the brush down on the desk. \"I don't!\" \"Except -\" I prompt. \"Except, I kinda do.\" She admits, staring intently at the floor. \"Jan and Missy, sittin' in a tree\" I tease. \"Finish that sentence and I'll tell Cliff you've got a crush,\" Missynthreatens. \"But, I don't.\" She grins. \"He doesn't know that.\" I consider what I know of her brother. Guitar obsessed. Hung up onnTorrance. Good line in vintage shirts. Attractive forearms. \"He wouldn't care.\" Missy flops down on the bed beside me. \"I know,\" she grumbles. I chuckle to myself as I watch her fidget with the ends of her hair. \"You know\" she says, \"You'd be a hell of a lot easier to threaten if younwere just slightly further into the closet.\" \"Yeah, it's a real shame I'm open about my sexuality, coz otherwise peoplenwould have reason to hate me.\" I'm generally a laid back guy, but on somensubjects, well, lets just say I have some issues. \"It's getting to you?\" I sigh. \"Not so much. I mean I am who I am, I'm just looking forward to college.\" \"Huh,\" she comments, \"Football jerks again?\" I raise an eyebrow. \"They bother Jan more than me.\" I watch her intently, looking for anreaction. \"Jan?\" Her face is so neutral right now... \"Yeah,\" I add, \"Jan\". Let's shift it up into gear. \"I think it bothers himnto hear the comments. He gets protective sometimes. Other times,\" I shrug,n\"he's just pissed.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah.\" Missy wraps a lock of hair around her forefingers, twisting it tight aroundnher skin. I take a breath. \"Did he kiss you?\" \"No,\" she breathes softly, \"but we were close.\" She closes her eyes,nremembering, and I watch as emotions play across her face. For a second shenlooks almost blissful, then, she returns with a sigh to playing with hernhair I have to ask. \"Where'd this come from Missy?\" She looks up at me, honest emotion evident on her features. \"I don't know,\" she whispers, \"I never thought of Jan as anything more.\"nShe trails off, lost in her confusion. \"But yesterday, it was such a rushnwhen he touched me. Everything felt real, you know? It just was right, feltnright. And now...\" \"And now you don't know where you stand.\" I complete. \"No,\" she sighs, \"I don't.\" \"You know the first stage is admitting you have a problem,\" I pun, hopingnto break her out of the emotional funk she's sunk into. \"Yeah Les and which one of the twelve steps allows me to get a crush onnanother girl's boyfriend.\" Missy gets aggressive with others when she'snpissed at herself. It took me a while to get this, to reconcile the badassnthat flipped across the gym at tryouts with the nervous, almost shy, girlnwho still gets embarrassed at games. I'm not sure that the others havenreally noticed, but the moments when Missy glowers or yells the most arenwhen she feels most vulnerable. \"Chill it Miss,\" I croon. \"I'm not attacking you.\" \"I know,\" she sighs. \"It's just that I've got visions about how this isngonna end up and none of them're are good.\" \"You're overstressing Missy,\" I soothe as she paces about the room. She'snmanic, wrapped up in herself over this. I tilt my head as something shensaid earlier registers. \"What did you mean when you said he has a girlfriend?\" \"I meant,\" she snaps back, \"that Jan has a girlfriend. Courtney.\" \"Courtney and Jan aren't anything,\" I say, \"They're just Courtney andnJan..\" \"Not helping.\" \"Sorry,\" I'm floundering here, a little lost in the difficulties of what itnis I'm trying to define. \"Courtney and Jan aren't serious; they just teaseneach other. A lot.\" \"Teasing's physical these days?\" She snipes. \"Kinda.\" I sigh, \"Look that's just how they are, how they've always been.nSince first grade Courtney and Jan have been messing about. It's notnserious.\" Except he's told me they've slept together and she's got a greatnimagination. Suddenly I'm not sure how serious they are or aren't. Jan'snalways talked about Courtney with a kind of awe in his voice, a why shouldnshe want me thing. But he's never displayed any emotion except thisnmasculine posturing thing, this sexual pride. He's never really seemed toncare about her. Never noticed when she's not around or spent time with her,nother than when they're, you know, fucking like bunnies. And it's not like she's much better. Torrance told me that Courtney refersnto Jan as her boy-toy, her fuck-buddy, never her boyfriend. I know itnbothered us, our fair captain and I, a while back, that they seemedncompletely without emotion. But then Torrance hooked up with Aaron and Inwas left by myself for the romantic suspicion thing. But it's true - whatever it is they have with each other it's not anboyfriend/girlfriend thing. It's barely a relationship. Just touches andnslipping fingers, foreplay and experimentation. It's not right. It just is. But then explaining this to Missy isn't going to be easy. ***** I wonder if I should have just stayed home last night. Just skipped out onnCourtney. Just said something like \"Sorry babe gotta catch up on somensleep/calculus/male bonding time with my buddy Les.\" What would've happenednif I just hadn't gone round. If I'd just stayed home. If I'd just callednMissy like two hours earlier so she wouldn't have had the \"It's late\"nexcuse. I wouldn't have this guilt for a start. I wouldn't have this whole two-timing-sex-fling-cheerleader issue that I'mncurrently wrapped up in. This isn't gonna be easy. In fact this could well be the opposite of easy,nlike damn hard or totally impossible. I'm not picky, but anything othernthan the easy road is just a general no-no for me, which I have to admitnkinda explains my complete idiocy last night. I didn't want to be there, I didn't want to do it, but talking to Courtneynand explaining that was just gonna be too damn difficult so I didn't.nExcept I did. Her. Twice. But it's not like I didn't have second thoughts. There were second thoughts. And third thoughts. Lots of thoughts. But nonaction, or more accurately, no reaction. I just went along with what it wasnmy body wanted and let Courtney have her way with me. Woo hoo! Wasn't thatnfun. I'm just all a tremble thinking about the nigh of sex that was,nmentally at least, entirely non-consensual on my behalf. (And please, thosenwatching at home, note the sarcasm here.) Though I'm thinking Missy's not going to see it that way. I slept with Courtney hours after there was.something.with Missy. Something. But what. I have to admit I'm more of doer than a thinker. Les always had to help menwith the academic shit, but my SATs weren't bad. It's just that when itncomes down to it I prefer shit I can solve, not stuff that requires, younknow, deliberation and introspection - as Darcy would say during one of hernSAT overdrives. So what am I doing here? Standing outside Missy's front door, confused asnhell but hopeful. I'm more of a doer than a thinker. And pressing doorbells, well that'snsomething you do. Not something you think about. So how come I'm thinking about it. My hand just hovers there over thenbutton, caught up in this thing that's going on between her and me. Thisnsomething. \"Are you coming in man, or what?\" Cliff stands in the open doorway, thisnshit-eating grin stretched across his face. He must have opened the doornwhile I was still trying to get to grips with the damn bell. \"Jan?\" he prompts. \"Yeah,\" I manage, \"sure Dude.\" I'm cool and collected. I'm chilled. I'm - I'm sweating. My palms are actually clammy right now. Cliff takes all this in with a raised eyebrow. I'm actually dreading hisnnext comment. We've never really bonded and I'm not sure how he feels aboutnthe squad given the post-regionals Torrance thing we all heard about fromnMissy. I wonder if he knows Torr and Aaron broke up? \"She's upstairs Jan.\" He says with a nod, pulling his ever-presentnearphones on. \"Thanks.\" I wipe my hands on my jeans and head for the stairs. \"Cliff.\" I call, paused on the first step. He turns, dropping the phones to his neck. \"Torr, she -\" \"Don't get involved in this Jan,\" he interrupts, softly. \"Not your place.\" \"It'll work out.\" I say, as much to reassure myself as to influence him. \"Maybe\" he shrugs. \"We'll see.\" And with that he drops out of sight ontonthe sofa, and I turn back to the stairs. Here we go. Taking them two at a time I jog up to the second story. I'm going to go seenMissy, and I'm gonna tell her something. Coz that's what this is.nSomething.[Chapter 4] Conventional By Redtoes I'd buried my face beneath a pillow in an attempt to block out Les's amusednlaughter so I didn't hear the soft knock at the door. I didn't hear the rapnof Jan's knuckles on the doorframe. I didn't see him leaning against thenwall watching as I hid under a pillow, trying desperately not to thinknabout, well, him, and the thoughts that Les had put in my head. So it came as a bit of a shock when Les stopped laughing and said - \"Jan. Dude.\" I feel the mattress shift a little as Les gets up. \"Les.\" I can hear the slap of skin as they exchange greetings. The two of them arenclose. Really close. It always amazed me how close they are. I mean mostnguys, most men, they have issues about sexuality. Jan gets stress and shitnjust coz he cheers. Les, he hides it well, but there's stuff he just won'tntalk about. Like his home-life. Like his sexuality beyond the basicndistinction of straight/gay. Les has issues, but he and Jan are tight. \"So.\" Jan starts. \"Yeah,\" Les answers, \"She's communing with the comforter.\" And that's enough for me to sit up and throw the pillow at him. Les catchesnit easily, and grins at me. \"Bit hostile Miss,\" he comments, eyebrow raised. \"Yeah,\" I fumble, \"well.\" Les is the only one grinning here. The only comfortable one in the room.nThe amused observer who just can't get enough of this stuff. My discomfort.nJan's unsurety. \"Les,\" I venture, \"Don't you have a place to be right now?\" \"Nope.\" I swear that's grin's getting wider. \"Les,\" I warn, my voice dangerously low. \"Missy?\" he asks, all innocence. The grin doesn't falter as I try to glare him out of the room. Jan's mouth quirks a little. \"Buddy.\" Jan says, his tone neutral. \"Okay,\" Les says, \"I'll catch you cats tomorrow.\" And with that he's gone. Leaving me and Jan alone. In my room. Alone. Did it suddenly get hot in here? Jan shifts on his feet, looking away from me. In fact looking everywherenbut at me. \"You've got to teach me how to do that,\" I say as he wanders around thenroom. \"Huh?\" \"The getting rid of Les thing.\" I say. \"It could be helpful.\" \"Yeah,\" he says, his eyes drifting over the framed photos on the wall. Notnlooking at me. Barely speaking. Uninterested. So now I'm uncomfortable, wondering what he's doing here. My mouth feelsndry, my skin sweaty. He's not interested. And man how much do I not want tonhear him say it. So. Let's be normal. With that thought in mind I slip off the bed, and move around until I cannsee what's got him so distracted. \"I look terrible in that one,\" I say, gesturing to the photo he holds innhis hands. \"All puffy and red. I should never let Cliff near a camera.\" Andnit's true, I do. And Cliff should never be allowed to carry machines he cannrecord anything on, images, sounds, anything. I swear every picture hentakes is a calculated attempt at blackmail. \"What happened?\" he asks. I look at the picture. I'm holding up the Kentucky State trophy so thatnwould make me what, sixteen? About two years old or so. Year and a half atnleast. But it's not the trophy that's caught Jan's attention. It's thenclear physical signs that I won that day while suffering from one of thenworst colds I've ever had. \"I'm a hardcore gymnast,\" I state, \"I laugh in the face of influenza. Insnigger at bronchitis.\" \"And no way is jumping up and down screaming \"go team\" gonna satisfy ya?\"nhe quotes back at me, a smile on his lips as he looks me straight in theneye. \"Something like that,\" I manage to get out past the blush that'snthreatening to take over my skin. \"Really,\" he says, leaning in a little closer. \"No,\" I quietly admit. \"I like it.\" \"Me too,\" he says softly. \"I like it a lot.\" There's some serious eye contact going on here. High level eye contact andna mega-watt smile. If I didn't know better I'd say he was flirting. I look away before I make it too obvious. He's not flirting. He can't benflirting. \"Would you like a drink,\" I ask, my eyes fixed on the table, \"Or somethingnto eat?\" \"I'm good,\" he replies. \"Yeah,\" I say, almost to myself as I start to step away. Except that his hand's on my arm, and I'm looking up at him and I'm caught,nand confused. And I have absolutely no idea what's happening right now. \"Missy,\" he breathes with something almost like pain in his voice. I staring into his eyes and I swear I could just die now except - Except - Except he just let go of my arm and stepped back. \"Maybe I should go,\" he says quietly, his eyes focused on the wall. \"No!\" The outburst surprises even me. \"Stay a while. I've got time. Nonpractice today.\" \"Okay,\" he says, \"what would you like to talk about.\" ***** She looked so much like herself when I got here. All rumpled and rufflednand buried beneath some cushion or other trying to ignore Les. She lookedntough and vulnerable, happy and angry. Honest. Truthful. There's no way she could hide her true feelings, she's such an expressivenperson. Dancing and joking when she's up. Quiet and thoughtful when she'sndown. And to find her hiding under her pillow, well that's just her. Les just grinned at me when I turned up. Fact he didn't stop grinning tillnhe left when he gave me this serious look through the door with thenunspoken message of \"Don't screw this up\". And I'm not gonna. If I have to spend the next three hours talking about photographs andngymnastics I'm gonna do it, coz it'll take me that long to get up enoughncourage to say what it is I want to say. Missy I like you. She's standing so close I could just reach out and - No. Talk first. Action later. Maybe. \"Take a seat.\" \"Huh?\" She's knocked me out of my own head and now I'm standing alone innthe middle of the room whilst she sits cross-legged on the bed. \"Come on,\" she says, \"there's loads of room.\" I know I'm just staring at her. Sitting there. On her bed. \"Come on Jan,\" she repeats. She's not quite tapping the quilt yet, but thenimplication is there. I take a quick glance around the room - there's onlynthe stool at the vanity and that's fair too small and too far away to benuseful. Yup, she means the bed. With enthusiasm I flop down on the mattress. She shifts her position to lienbeside me, kicking her feet in the air negligently. \"It's a big bed.\" I comment needlessly. \"Yeah,\" she comments, \"I think my parents really expect me to get somenaction this year.\" I bite back a very unmanly gasp. \"Yeah?\" She grins. \"Possibly,\" she answers, \"It's the first house I've ever had a double in.nThe rest have been twins.\" \"Like you and Cliff?\" I ask. I've always been curious how it is they're innthe same academic year. \"Nah,\" she replies, \"He's older by, get this, ten months. Guess thenparentals didn't want to wait.\" She mock shudders. \"Freaks me outnsometimes, to think I'm the result of them getting back to sex as quicklynas possible after having him.\" I smile. \"Good result.\" I comment. She blushes, the colour sweeping up from her neck, up across the featuresnof her face, and down to the tint the skin of her shoulders. Embarrassednshe stares down at the mattress. I want to touch her and find out if her body's warmer when she blushes. I can't stop my hand as it reaches out to brush a strand of hair from herncheek. Ever so gently I tuck it behind her ear, and let my fingers brushndown the line of her chin as I start to withdraw. Swallowing deeply she opens her eyes as I touch her skin and looks up atnme. I'm leaning in towards her, moving closer and closer as the secondsnpass. As she pushes in towards me my hand slips back into her hair, cradling hernneck. And that's all the reasons I need as I pull her closer, closing thenlast few centimeters, and lower my lips to hers. ***** As kisses go this one's pretty much amazing. His lips against mine, his hand on my neck, our mouths together. Somewhere, caught up in the moment, I raise my arms around his neck and letnpull me closer by a hand on my waist. And it's perfect. We lie together, side by side, and I have to say I'm not one for romanticnclichés but if something ever felt right, this is it. He pulls back slightly, watching my face intensely. \"I should tell you something,\" he says softly, \"I like you. I really likenyou Missy.\" \"I really like you too Jan,\" I reply, barely getting time to reply as henpulls me close again for another soul-searing kiss. \"I really like yountoo.\"[Chapter 5] Traditional ****** There are ways that I imagined this going. There's the usual expectations about what's going to happen. There arenhopes and thoughts and the odd fantasy that plays out during an especiallyndull math class. There are possibilities. Options. But in all my imaginings, my musings, I never quite got this right. I never quite thought that Jan's hands in my hair would feel so good. Ornthat his lips were so soft. Or that the look in his eyes could tightennthings low in my body. We're lying so close together that I can't help but notice that I'm not thenonly one happy about this. He pulls back from me slightly, a smile on his face. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah,\" I breathe. \"I'm good.\" \"Good.\" He says through a satisfied grin. I stare up at him. At that quirky grin he has; part arrogance, part manlynpride, part impressed. He's almost basking in the glow of his victory henlooks so immensely satisfied. \"You're looking,\" I pause, searching for the right word. \"Stunningly attractive, dashingly manly?\" He suggests, a glint in his eye. \"Chirpy.\" I decide. He raises an eyebrow. \"Chirpy?\" \"Chirpy.\" He nods, slowly. \"Chirpy,\" he says, \"full of chirp.\" He grins. \"There's possibilities.\" Instunned. \"You're not serious.\" I didn't think he's take it quite like that. There's a long pause as he leaves me hanging here, getting more embarrassednby the second until - \"Nope,\" he says, leaning in to steal a quick kiss. \"Oh God,\" I moan, throwing myself back into the pillows and pulling onenover my face to hide my embarrassment. \"I actually bought that!\" And he's laughing. \"Jan!\" I yell into the pillow. Still laughing. \"Hey Missy,\" he says softly, \"Stop hiding.\" I lift the cushion slowly to find Jan staring up at me from where he'snrested on my stomach. Having pillowed his head against his forearms henlooks up at me, an expression halfway between \"love me\" and \"laugh at me\"nstretched across his features. \"Hey,\" he says all trace of his earlier merriment gone. \"Hey,\" I reply. It's a good word might as well use while I can. I'll havento think of something else to say soon enough anyway. \"So.\" \"So.\" It's hard enough breathing whilst he lies so close to me he's practicallynon me, but think? I'm sorry but there is just no way that's ever happening with this kind ofnphysical proximity going on. So now I'm stuck on what to do next. \"Yeah,\" I breathe softly. \"Okay.\" \"You know what,\" he says, the grin back in place, \"I think we should justngive up on this whole talking thing for a while.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah.\" He stalks up my body like a predator, all stealth and controlled bodynmovement. And I'm so caught up in watching how he moves that I don'tnregister that he's looming over me, holding himself up over me. He's notnimposing at all, in fact, if there is such a thing as \"un-posing\" he'sndoing that. I can't quite figure it until I realize that he's waiting forna sign from me. Trying not to push unless I confirm it's okay. I look up at him. Watching the muscles in his arms and shoulders hold himnup. Watching his attempts to hold his body still as he drops his head forna kiss. He's great. And I want to show him that. With a grin I grab his belt with both hands and yank him down. \"Couldn't wait, huh?\" he teases. \"No,\" I say, raising my arms around his neck, \"I couldn't.\" ***** And we're kissing again. I can taste her, and she's wonderful. She's great. She's - Slipping her hand under my t-shirt to tickle my lower back. Huh. Well two can play that game. I let my hands drift down the sides of her body, softly, gently moving overnclothing until I reach the right point and it's - \"Ahhh!\" She shrieks trying to dislodge my grip on her waist. \"Thatntickles!\" \"Does it?\" I question. \"Yeah! Stop!\" She squirms against my grip her t-shirt rising up and she pushes against mynwrists. I lift her up, pulling her to her knees. I can't help but lovenplaying like this. I love that I can pick her up, and throw her in the airnbecause she trusts me. Maybe I should get Les to talk to Torrance comenMonday and change the pairs. \"Jan! I'm warning you.\" I can't help but laugh as she twists and turns, trying to get loose. Hernmouth threatening me while her eyes tease. Abruptly I let go of her torso and instead reach to cup her face as I stealna kiss in the middle of another threat. She relaxes against me, melting into the kiss. I pull my head back, smoothing her hair down my hand as I hold her close. Actions speak louder than words, right man? Well right now her eyes arensaying everything I've ever wanted to hear, and I've got a feeling thatnmine are returning the favor. This is perfect. Really. I lean back, pulling her tight against my chest. We seem to sigh together,nrelaxing into this new, different situation. A new position for us. A newnposition for me. Just lying here, relaxed, together. I've never really done this before. Just been with someone. Just been. Huh. So it's about the point where I realize that I'm just content to lie herenthat Missy decides to have \"the talk.\" \"So.\" \"So what?\" I ask. \"So what is it we're doing here?\" \"Ah,\" dammit, \"that was that kinda 'so'\". \"Jan.\" \"Okay, okay\". Right now I'm seriously suppressing my built in masculinenurge to run for the hills at the first sign of a serious relationshipnconversation. \"I mean,\" she says, her head rested on my shoulder and one hand absentlynstroking my stomach, \"that you kissed me.\" \"Yeah. I did that. And then you kissed me.\" \"Right.\" She agrees, then doggedly pursues her point with another: \"So.\" \"Do we have to do this,\" I say, interrupting the awkward silence left bynher last \"so\". \"I mean can't we just say I like you and you like me andnwe're cool with that. Do we have to talk about it?\" \"You like me?\" She questions, mock surprise in her voice. I wonder ifnshe's nervous. Les is always talking about how people disguise emotionnwith, like, other stuff. I wonder if the \"shock horror!\" tone she'snadopted right now means that she's anywhere near as nervous as I am. \"Yeah,\" I'm figuring honesty is the best policy right now. \"I like you. Inlike you a lot.\" \"Good,\" she says snuggling into my shoulder. \"I like you too.\" I'm waiting for the rest of this. I'm waiting for the \"so what do we donnow\" and the \"is this an actual relationship\" questions. The anticipationnof the romantic inquisition is getting to me. Coz she's not saying anything. \"Missy?\" I say slowly. \"Yeah,\" she murmurs. \"That it?\" I swear I can feel her smiling through my shirt. \"Yeah Jan. That's it. Coz you like me and I like you and right now,nthat's all that matters.\" \"Really?\" I ask, amazed at her ability to just take things in her stridenwithout analyzing them to death like so many other people I know. \"You realize I'm gonna get shit from Cliff about this,\" she teases, \"You'dnbetter be worth the hassle.\" I grin. \"I am,\" I say. \"Just wait and see.\" I can feel her grinning again as her arms come up and hug me tightly. Inrearrange my body slightly, shifting her weight so I can move one hand upnto lie against her hip and the other to weave through her fingers againstnmy torso. And it's worth it. It really is. It's perfect. Coz she likes me. And I like her. Together we like eachnother. And that's all I need.[Chapter 6] Customary ******* I kissed her goodbye when I left her house. And when I left her room. Andnwhen I left her bed. I just couldn't stop kissing her. The moment wasnthere and I took it. It was almost as if I was aware that our afternoon ofnemotional fun wasn't going to last. It was almost as if I knew in some strange psychic part of my mind thenstress and difficulties we were going to have to go through. The painfulncomplications. The well structured manipulations. All of it. I somehownknew that this could be my last time to kiss her without looking over mynshoulder to see who's watching. The last time I could touch her withoutnworrying about whether we can survive the wrath of the squad. Or, more accurately, the wrath of Courtney. So I left her with a kiss. Well there were about 8 actual lip-locks afternthe goodbye and before I made it out of the house but still; goodbye, kiss,nleave. I'm happy and confident and jubilant (I maintain that Darcy's dad paid fornher SAT verbal score and that I am in no way jealous of her freaked outnvocab). I'm good. I'm psyched. And I'm feeling this up until when I'm about three quarters home and mynphone rings. \"Hello.\" \"You ran out on me this morning mister.\" Courtney. \"Courtney?\" \"Yeah,\" she says, her tone reflecting her obvious amusement, \"Who else havenyou been sleeping with?\" \"No one.\" Technically true, as Missy and I neither slept nor made it pastnthe earlier bases. \"Of course not,\" she purrs down the phone, \"Why would you want anyone butnme?\" She teasing I know it but part of me is suddenly terrified that she knows.nAnd of what she'll do if she knows. To Missy. To me. But especially tonMissy. So I'm silent. Struck silent with fear, wondering how on earth I'mnsupposed to respond to that. I don't want her, I don't want to see her.nThis thing, whatever it was, is over between us. It is no more. Gone. I can tell she's wondering about my lack of reply but I honestly can'tnthink of a ting to say that won't wither plunge us all into a world ofnshit, or be unfair to Missy by lying to Courtney. \"Wanna come round Lover?\" No I really don't. And the choices I made last night suddenly seem crazy.nWhy the hell did I sleep with her. Why? \"Jan?\" \"Gotta go Court,\" I manage to croak out, \"I've got that swing demo tomorrownwith Torr and Les.\" And Missy. \"I'm gonna need some sleep,\" and space,n\"if I'm gonna get through it.\" \"Oh,\" she says, her disappointment evident. \"Yeah,\" I commiserate. \"Gotta go.\" I snap the phone closed before she can comment. This is going to be difficult. And dangerous. I'm playing with fire withnCourtney and I'm not sure whether to involve Missy. Coz as much as I willnadmit that it's been one of my fantasies to be caught between two beautifulngirls, I only want one of them, and I'm not sure how to tell the other thatnwithout fucking up the squad dynamic. And right now, with just under 3nweeks to go to Finals, we need that dynamic solid. Could I just avoid Courtney for the next month, would it be possible for mento just not see her, like other than practices. To just avoid going over to hers, not not wait for her after practice ornspend Friday nights on her coach or in her bed. Could I just not do it.nNot do her. For the next month. Right now I feel like a coward for even thinking of it but I'm not surenthere's anything else I can do. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.n A relationship and a vengeful bitch. I don't want to be here. I just - I just want Missy. I just wish I knew what to do right now. My heart's telling me to justnturn around and go back to the Pantone's place, but my head's yellingnshe'll never understand and I wouldn't know how to explain it. A rock and a hard place. A blonde and a brunette. God I wish we didn't have finals so I could just say goodbye to Courtneynand be done with it. God I wish life was simple. ***** Today is a good day. It is. I checked. Today I get to dance with Jan. I get to spend the day with Jan, andnTorrance and Les. But with Jan. Without Courtney. Just with my two best friends and my (GULP!) boyfriend. Learning to dance. Could anything be better? Well yes, that was suitably demonstrated yesterday, when he - Yum. Happy thoughts. Lots of happy thoughts. Coz today is a good day. And yesterday was angreat day. I just couldn't stop grinning in the car on the way over. Les just satnthere and made amused comments about my \"glow\", my \"chirpiness\" and myn\"mysteriously happy demeanor\" as he drove. \"I don't know what you're so happy about?\" I threw back at him at onenpoint. \"I'm just psyched,\" he grinned. \"You're psyched that I'm with Jan.\" \"Yeah. It's about damn time.\" He's got this insufferably smug look on hisnface. It's just begging me to wipe it off. \"You're talking like there was a pool or something\" I tease. His grin gets wider. No. It can't be. \"There was a pool?\" I think my voice just got a little higher than normal. \"No,\" he says, dragging out the word with mock sincerity. \"There was a pool?\" I repeat, forcing my voice calm. \"We. speculated,\" he admits. \"We?\" \"Torrance and I had thoughts.\" \"Which led to conversation,\" I continue. \"And to a bet?\" \"Perhaps,\" he admits with a grin, \"perhaps not.\" That trademarked Les grin that just screams there's something he knows thatnyou don't. That confident, energetic smile that he uses as a defensenagainst the comments and jibes of the world and the football homophobes.nHe's just radiating amusement as he checks the mirror, turns the corner andnpulls up outside the gym. He cuts the engine and turns to me, grin solidly in place. \"You're going to make this an issue now?\" He comments cryptically. Huh? \"Huh?\" I'm eloquent when I'm confused. And he's still grinning, dammit. \"Les,\" I warn, \"What aren't you telling me?\" The grin continues. \"Les?\" And all at once I can feel something against my neck - heavier than anbreeze from the open window but lighter than a touch. I catch my breath asnarms slip around my shoulders. I twist my neck around to kiss Jan as Insink into his embrace. \"Hey,\" he says, her mouth mere millimeters from mine. \"Hey yourself\" I breathe. He smiles. \"I missed you,\" he whispers as he drops his lips to mine. Les abruptly shifts from a grin to all out laughter and knocks us out ofnour revelry. \"You guys,\" he manages between snorting giggles. \"You're just so - \" \"Cute?\" Jan pulls back from the car enough for me to see Torrance standing, hand onnhip, with a very amused look on her face. \"Torr,\" I say as I get out of the car, \"hi.\" \"Hey Torr,\" Jan adds, \"Good to see ya.\" \"Yeah,\" she replies, eyebrow raised, \"I bet.\" She grins. \"Come on guys,ndon't wanna be late.\" Jan and I exchange looks as Torrance shoulders her gym bags and heads fornthe building. \"Should I?\" he asks softly. \"No,\" I say, \"I've got this one. Can you get my bag?\" \"Sure,\" he says, kissing my nose, \"you go explain to Torr. I'll get thenluggage.\" \"My hero,\" I tease as I set off after my captain and best friend. She's not moving fast but it takes me a second to catch up to her. \"So,\" she says. \"Yeah.\" \"So.\" She repeats, her tone indicating that she wants more. \"Yeah,\" I answer, entirely unsure of where I am right now. \"So I broke up with Aaron,\" she says. \"Really,\" I'm stunned. I mean the guy was a total loser but she just nevernseemed to be able to see it. \"You broke up with him?\" \"Yeah,\" she says. \"Impressed?\" \"Hell yeah.\" And I am. Deeply. Or maybe I'd just prefer to see herndating my obnoxious but ultimately harmless brother than Aaron the all timenultimate jerk. \"Cool,\" she says, \"So, you and Jan?\" \"Yeah,\" I admit. \"We just\" - I pause, thinking of the right word - \"kindanhappened.\" \"When?\" When indeed. We kissed on Saturday. Talked on Saturday. Started onnSaturday. But on Friday. \"Yesterday, I guess\" except, \"except that it was kinda on Friday.\" \"Decisive,\" she says with a nod. \"Yeah well,\" I sheepishly admit, \"It's a bit complicated.\" \"No kidding,\" she smiles, \"So this is recent? A Friday, Saturday thing?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Nothing happened at the regionals?\" \"What? No.\" \"Good.\" What? \"Les!\" she yells over her shoulder. \"Yeah?\" He runs up, bag over his shoulder, the picture of enthusiasm asnopposed to the amused Jan following in his wake. \"I win,\" she announces. \"Win what?\" Jan asks. \"I win,\" she repeats with a grin, \"hand it over.\" I'm all confused up until the point Les grumpily hands over twenty bucks. \"There was a bet!\" I exclaim. \"A bet?\" Jan asks, \"on us? \"Yeah,\" I tell him, before turning on Torrance and Les. \"You knew.\" \"We suspected.\" Torrance admits. \"And hoped,\" Les adds, \"you'd see sense.\" \"So you're not mad?\" I ask. \"We're not mad,\" Torrance reassures me. \"Not at all,\" Les adds. \"So that's good,\" Jan says. \"Hold on,\" I watching the faces here and there's something they're notntelling me. \"Where's the but?\" \"The but?\" Les questions, his face a picture of innocence. \"The but,\" I confirm, watching them both carefully. \"Yeah,\" Jan agrees, \"There's something else here.\" \"Okay,\" Torrance looks away for a second. \"There's a but.\" \"This isn't a good but is it?\" Jan asks, despondently. \"No.\" Les shifts on his feet, uncomfortable. \"Okay,\" Torrance says, biting the bullet, \"This is gonna sound harsh butnhear me out okay? We've talked about this thing, about what would happennif this thing happened. Between you. Before the Nationals.\" \"Ah,\" Jan sighs. \"Is this going where I think it's going?\" I ask. \"Coz if it is I don'tnwant to hear it.\" \"Missy,\" Les starts, \"It's just that -\" \"No,\" I say. \"Don't.\" \"Yeah,\" Jan agrees, \"You don't have to. We've got this.\" \"You know that this isn't about you guys,\" Torrance emphasizes, \"It's aboutnthe squad.\" \"It isn't always the squad Torrance,\" Jan snaps, \"Be honest. This isn'tnabout the squad. This is about Courtney.\" I know I just flinched. And I know that Jan and Torrance are too caught upnin their fight to have noticed it. But Les noticed. He noticesneverything. He's too damn smart for his own good. \"Missy,\" he says softly. \"Yeah,\" I breathe, \"yeah.\" I look across to Jan and Torrance's face off.n\"Guys.\" But they don't even miss a beat. \"My personal life is not for the good of the squad -\" \"The squad needs to be healthy!\" \"GUYS!\" Silence rules. Missy and Jan stare at me, while Les hides a grin. \"It's cool,\" I explain. \"It's fine. We're gonna keep this, until afternNationals.\" I look Torrance straight in the eye. \"For the good of the squad.\" She looks away. \"I'm sorry,\" she admits, \"but there's no choice.\" \"You should have more faith in people Torr,\" Jan puts in. \"We don't knownhow she'll react.\" \"I don't want to see how she'll react,\" Les points out, \"But I think you'dnbetter start separating yourself from her.\" \"I'm sorry Missy, Jan, and I don't want to ask you to do this, but I havento.\" Torrance says. \"We all have to, for the good of the squad.\" \"But you're not mad?\" I ask in a very small voice. \"No,\" she says, \"I'm not. I'm just stuck.\" \"I know.\" \"Are we cool?\" she asks, obviously uncertain. \"Yeah,\" I say, \"But can we not, for today? Can today just be us four, notnthe squad?\" \"Yeah,\" she says. \"I can do that.\" \"Good,\" I say, letting my boyfriend pull me into his arms. \"Thanks.\" \"So today,\" Les prompts. \"Today's about us.\" Jan says. \"Cool\" Torrance says, grabbing my hand and pulling me away from Jan. \"Inwant to know everything.\" I can't help but grin as she drags me into the girls locker room,nchattering away the whole time. She's cool. We're cool. There's gonna benissues with the squad, but they can wait. You know why? Coz today's a good day.[Chapter 7] Unusual By Redtoes Authors notes - part 7 of 10. Writing this series forced me out to HMV tonbuy the video of Bring it On when I should be packing up my stuff as I'mnmoving to London tomorrow. Hope it's worth the stress.. Summary - At the mime/interpretive dance seminar Courtney catches on thenJan and Missy. How will she react? Disclaimer - not mine, no money, go sue someone else. Feedback \"feels like first\". I always considered myself a reasonable person. I always thought that Inwas, if not nice, then good. I mean, I tease, I bitch, I argue, but I'vennever actually hurt someone. Or I guess if I'm honest, that should be thatnI've never really hurt someone. The odd comment here and there may reducensome freak to tears, but actual heart rending pain, never. I'm a good person. I am. Really. I want to do what's best. Generally what's best for me, I admit, but I'vennever trampled anyone's heart, just a few egos and the odd testicle. Which is probably why I'm having so much difficulty dealing with what I'mnseeing right now. It's probably nothing. It has to be nothing. 'Coz there's simply no waynthat what I'm seeing is real. ***** \"Did you sleep well?\" I hear him before I see him. I can feel him behind me before I turn mynhead to see he's there. He leans in close, resting his chin on my shouldernas I read the announcements on the gym notice board. \"Okay, you?\" \"Could have been better,\" he admits, \"You could have been there.\" \"Woah cowboy,\" I tease as I turn to face him. \"Slow down. I'm in no hurrynto hear you snore.\" \"I don't snore,\" Jan says. \"Do too,\" I grin, \"Les told me. Though I maybe should ask how he knows.\" \"Do you honestly want to know?\" He replies. \"Oh I know already. Les. Gossip. Les.\" \"Yeah,\" he says, an irritated look on his face. \"You wouldn't believe the stuff I know,\" I tease. \"Like what?\" \"Like,\" I say, stepping close enough that the material of my vest grazesnagainst his t-shirt, \"when you and Les decided that the squad needed waternballoons in order to wash cars. And how exactly it was that the 99' cupnended up as a punch bowl?\" \"Yeah,\" he says uncomfortably, running his hand through his hair, \"That'snan interesting question.\" \"I think so,\" I smile, moving closer. \"Really,\" he smirks, slipping his arms around me. \"Yeah,\" I say, relaxing in his arms, my lips moving ever closer to his. We pause in the moment, caught up in each other. I'm just smiling at him, close to him, held by him. I'm happy. I'mncontent. I'm - *Cough* And we separate in an instant. \"Hi guys,\" Torrance says with a smile. \"Hey.\" \"So,\" she says, \"getting cozy?\" \"Torrance -\" Jan starts. \"Torr, it's nothing, just saying hi,\" I interrupt. \"Yeah,\" she comments, \"Like I believe that.\" \"Torr.\" \"Not here, okay guys, just not here.\" \"Fine,\" I agree as Jan reluctantly nods his consent. \"Come on,\" she beckons to me, \"help me greet our demos.\" ***** I don't believe it. I don't want to believe it. I don't even want to know. Oh God. Jan And Missy? When the hell did this happen? Jan's, he's, woah. What is going on here? When did this happen? How did this happen? Why..? Oh hell no. I am not one of those women who sit there and pine for the onenthat got away. One's do not get away from me. I let them go. I damn well let them go. He spent a night last week with me. With me. In my bed. WITH ME. This is not happening. It's just a head turning thing. She's new, andnperky and innocent. There's attraction there but that's to be expected.nThere's been attraction before, but who's the one he always comes back to? Me. I. Courtney. This time's no different. And what's it matter if I don't even want him. He's mine. She's a skankynwhore and soon he'll see it. Because he's mine. Just wait and see. ***** So the day goes well, or at least as well as can be expected consideringnwe're studying mine and fucking interpretive dance. Torrance and Les get anton of ideas for the new routine and we, the squad, are well on our way tonNationals. With three weeks to go. Three weeks. I can do three weeks. I work well under pressure. And so I sit here and watch Torrance sketch out her ideas to the squad, thendance moves, the lifts, the throws. Everything we need for a walk through.n A basic plan, with the details to be filled in later. We disperse amongst the room, the guys stepping back to let the ladies worknout the first steps. \"You up for this,\" Les asks me softly, as we watch Torrance and Missy worknout the opening moves. \"Yeah, course,\" I reply, more interested in the girls than a conversationnI've had a million times. \"Jan,\" he says, catching my arm, \"This is serious, this is when everythingnbecomes a loading question, when you can't touch her or hug her, whennyou've got to be focused. Can you do this?\" \"Yeah Les,\" I say holding his eyes, \"I can do this.\" He squeezes my arm innsolidarity, then lets go in time to see Courtney grinning at me from acrossnthe room while Missy practices her steps. Courtney's grinning at me? \"Yeah I caught that too,\" Les mutters from behind me. \"She's just grinning. She grins,\" I reply under my breath. \"Yeah, she's grinning,\" he says, \"she's grinning like a damn shark.\" \"It's nothing,\" I say, but I'm unconvinced. She's hasn't smiled like thatnin a while. She has plans when she smiles like that. God I hope she doesn't have plans. Courtney bounces over to me as the routine breaks up. \"Same time tomorrow night Lover?\" Ah, so she doesn't know. Really doesn'tnknow, to the extent she thinks I'll be around on Friday night like always. \"Er,\" I start, entirely unsure of what to say here. \"Jan's at mine,\" Les jumps in, \"He's helping me work on something.\" Courtney raises an eyebrow. \"Like what?\" \"Like,\" Les pauses, that too smart brain of his abandoning him in hisnmoment of need. \"Like...\" \"Like the new routine,\" Torrance puts in. \"I need both of them.\" \"Both of them?\" Now Whitney's in on the eyebrow raising. \"Planning anspitroast Torr?\" \"Ladies, ladies,\" Les says in his most placating tone of voice, \"you shouldnknow by now I won't be tempted, no matter how much you try.\" \"Maybe that's why Jan's there,\" says Whitney, blatantly channeling Big Red. \"Whitney,\" Courtney mock chides, \"You know Jan's mine.\" She leans innclose, giving me a clear view down her top, \"Normal time Lover?\" \"Er..\" \"Cat got your tongue?\" Whitney snipes. \"Er..\" \"Jan?\" Courtney prompts. And then, at the worst possible moment - \"What's up guys?\" Missy asks, wiping off the sweat from her solo practicenwith a towel. \"Jan and I were just discussing what time he's coming round on Friday.\"nCourtney says with such a sweet smile that I want to slap her. \"Huh?\" \"Jan always spends Friday nights with me.\" She says, watching Missy's facenintently. I'm watching her too. Torrance is watching, and Les. Whitney has thisnlook of perverse pleasure on her face and the entire squad is caught up innthis drama that they don't quite understand. \"What's going on?\" She's confused with, I have to admit, good reason. \"Isnthere something...\" I can hear the pause last, drag on towards awkwardness. \"Jan's mine.\" Courtney states, slipping her arms around me. I should be saying something right now. I should be moving. I should bendoing anything that would take that confused hurt look off of Missy's face. And I see it as she rebuilds her walls, changes her expression and justnsays - \"Sure. Whatever. I'm hitting the showers now so any chance of a lift homenLes?\" \"Yeah,\" Les replies. \"I'll be in the lot.\" \"Sure.\" And she walks off. Courtney wraps herself even further around me but I'm still speechless.nI'm still lost. I didn't expect it to be like this. I should've. I should have remembered Courtney hates to be threatened at anything. I don't know what to do. I've Courtney wrapped around me, Les with thenmost neutral of faces, Torrance barely restraining herself from an angrynrage. And Missy gone. I don't know how to fix this. It went too fast. And Missy knew Courtney could be an issue but I don't think she expectednanything like this. Anything like this. God I have to fix this. I look down to see Courtney smiling up at me, grinning like a predator, asnshe runs her hands across my chest. Got to fix this. Got to.[Chapter 8] Abnormal By Redtoes Part 8 of the Synonyms Series Authors Note 1 - Sorry about the late update, moving to London and a lacknof internet access postponed my posting of this installment. Authors Note 2 - For all those grammar geeks out there - yes the series isncalled Synonyms, but the first 6 stories were variations on thenpredictable/obvious titles of the first 2. This lasted until Missy and Jannbroke up (!) or at least began to in the last fic number 7. The theme thennchanged to Antonyms. The last 4 stories (I've planned four but it may takenlonger to resolve seeing as how long it took to get them together) willnhave the same type of title. The series title is still \"synonyms\". Okaynand if you followed any of that and actually understand it then you get angold star, or, as is more likely, a virtual hug if you leave me feedback. Disclaimer - She's not, he's not, they're not, and you're not mine. I,nhowever, am and will continue to exert ownership rights over myself. He didn't say anything. He just stood there, with that blond bimbo of a bitch wrapped around himnand didn't say anything. And no I'm not stupid. Yes I could see he was uncomfortable. I could seenhe looked trapped and stunned and probably has a plausible if not actuallyna good reason why he made less noise than a statue. So I'm aware of him,nhis state of mind, his expression. Right? So do you get yet why I'm never going to speak to the guy again? No? Well let me explain it for you. I was watching their conversation. Let the record show that I was keepingntrack of what was being said and in no way was I just training unaware onnthe other side of the room. I heard Courtney's requests and Whitney'sncomments and Torrance and Les's bumbling attempts at an excuse. I heardnJan's silence. I heard it all. The boy's a talker, you know that? He talks. He's always got something tonsay, always got something to share. Comments, opinions, arguments; alwaysnsomething. He doesn't get quiet very often, but if he does, well that's anwhole new ball game, and usually one he's losing. It's when he's quiet you have to worry. It's the times when he walks off, or just stands there that are serious.nThe issues that get to him he doesn't comment on. He stays out of them.nMaybe it's a defense mechanism of some sort, though if so it's a damnnstupid one that deserves to be removed by some painful process. It's when he says nothing you have to worry. When he's silent you're in trouble. And he didn't say a word in there. Not one. So what am I supposed to think? That he's with me. Or that he's withnCourtney? Courtney certainly seems to think he is. I mean, I know he mentioned there would be stress with Courtney. Lesnmentioned we should be aware of Courtney. Torrance warned me aboutnCourtney. It all comes back to Courtney. Or maybe it never left her to begin with. So what am I here? The dunce who got taken for a ride by a bit of sexualntension and read too much into it? An idiot for fell for the guy with angirlfriend? What am I left with? I'm still toweling my hair dry when the rest of the girls, minus Courtney,nWhitney and Torrance walk in. \"What's that about?\" Casey asks in that clueless innocent voice of hers. \"That was Courtney,\" Darcy answers, \"being Courtney.\" \"Yeah,\" one of the others adds, \"Courtney's being Courtney.\" \"She gets like that sometimes,\" Darcy clarifies, \"She's a bitch.\" She really is. I know it. Courtney's a bitch.nI quietly pack up my stuff, and manage to slip out a side door just asnCourtney and Whitney strut into the Locker room. I know Torrance will be waiting for me with Les, she'll have put off hernshower for a few to make sure she doesn't miss me. She won't want me to donsomething I'll regret. Like kick Jan's ass off a cliff, or into heavyntraffic. I mean how dare he? How dare he keep from me that he's actually having anrelationship with Courtney. He should have told me. He really should of.nI mean, if only so I'd know his side and wouldn't find out from Courtney.nDamn her. Damn him. I just want to get out of here. I need to think and I can't here. He'snhere somewhere. Maybe with her. Maybe they're - \"Missy.\" Or maybe he's standing behind me. \"Missy, I -\" Maybe he's standing behind me, holding his arms out to me in this lost,nhopeful way. Maybe he's got this look of pain and confusion etched across his face, thisndetermination to make things right but the complete lack of any clue how tondo it. \"Missy, Courtney, I -\" He's trying so hard to figure this out. \"Did you sleep with her?\" Why did I say that? Why do I even want to know that? Why did I - Oh god he just flinched. He flinched. \"It's complicated.\" No kidding it's complicated. \"Complicated?\" \"Yeah,\" he admits, \"complicated.\" \"But it's the kinda complicated that's in the past, right?\" Man I hate hownmy voice sounds, all reedy and weak, like I need him. I don't need him. Indon't need this. I was perfectly fine before this came along, I was good,nI was happy - and why the hell hasn't he answered my question yet? \"Jan?\" I query. \"It's complicated.\" He says, spreading his hands wide. \"You're still sleeping with her?\" \"No,\" he says, \"I mean, she thinks I am, but I'm not.\" \"Jan, you gotta explain that, coz right now you're not making much sense.\" \"I'm not sleeping with Courtney,\" he says, stepping forward to cup my facenin his hands, \"I'm not. I'm with you. I want you.\" And just as I start to relax, something occurs to me. \"So how's it complicated?\" \"It just is.\" \"No,\" I say, pulling back, \"It's not. We're us, and she's her, and thenonly reason she doesn't know that we're us and she's her is because of thensquad. So we don't mess with the dynamic. It's not complicated, it's justnsecret.\" He shifts on his feet. \"But that's not all of it, is it?\" I say, watching his discomfort.n\"There's more, isn't there?\" He looks away. \"What aren't you telling me?\" \"Nothing,\" he says, \"nothing important.\" \"It must be something.\" Jan steps back, looking anywhere but at me. \"Look I'd better go,\" I say. \"Missy,\" he starts, \"This isn't what you think.\" \"Isn't it, coz I think you not being straight with me. Is it what Inthink?\" \"Missy,\" he pleads, \"This is complicated.\" \"Did something happen,\" I venture quietly, \"with her, I mean since me?\" And he doesn't look at me. He doesn't fucking look at me. Oh God. Oh shit. And I'm running down the hallway. Running away from him. Running out thendoor. Running past Torrance. Running past Les. Running away from all of this. And I'm not going to stop. I'm just going to keep on going. Because Jan slept with Courtney. Jan slept with Courtney. My Jan. But he's not mine anymore. If he was ever mine to begin with. Because he slept with Courtney. Oh God.[Chapter 9] Divergent Part 9 of Synonyms Author's Note - so I got 'em together and then I broke them up. Missy'snbeen stewing, Jan's all confused about what to do and Courtney's got thisnwhole jubilation thing going on. What will happen next? Author's note 2 - okay so I messed around with the time line a little, butnit's not major. Assume all of those scenes happened (\"bring it\" and \"theyncannot not go\") but that they were \"off-screen\" so to speak. For thenpurposes of this story the cliff-missy dancing in the living room scenenhappens after the interpretive dance session. Disclaimer - I do not own any of these characters. I do own a batterednlaptop, a copy of the video and a somewhat sadistic imagination. Wish mynstuff was a little more bankable. \"Okay. Well that wasn't good.\" \"Les,\" Torrance says, \"You're a master of understatement.\" \"Well,\" I gesture in the direction of Missy's departure, \"that wasn'tngood.\" \"No kidding.\" She pauses, \"What're we gonna do?\" \"Well she wouldn't be moving like than unless she'd talked to him, and hensaid the wrong thing.\" \"Like what?\" Torrance questions. \"Like how recently he's slept with Courtney. Woah!\" I placate the instantnrage evident on her face, \"I don't know he's done anything, I just suspectnthat there's some stuff we don't know.\" \"Yeah,\" Torrance muses, staring after Missy. \"I'll take her, you takenhim.\" \"Great,\" I enthuse sarcastically. \"Can't wait to wade in on this trauma.\" ****** \"Jan? Buddy?\" I call as I move through the locker room. \"You there?\" \"No.\" Comes the typical, stubborn response. \"Right,\" I drawl. I round a corner and there he is. Back to the wall, elbows resting onnknees, his head tilted back, eyes closed. He'd almost look relaxed - if henwasn't sitting against one of the walls of the communal shower. \"You look comfy.\" I venture, taking in the scene. \"Yeah.\" \"So what happened?\" I gesture to his surroundings. \"You get lost on thenway to the shower.\" \"Maybe.\" \"Or did you slip?\" I probe, watching the skin around his eyes flinch. And it does. Majorly. \"Did you slip Jan?\" \"No.\" He moans quietly, dropping his head into his hands. \"Yes.\" \"Huh.\" Leaning against the wall, I slowly let myself slip down so I'mnsitting beside him. Beside my best friend and all of his misery. And I keep silent, just letting him work his way around to it. \"There was, I mean, I may have, possibly, done something I regret. Fornlike the past three years.\" \"Courtney?\" I ask. \"Courtney.\" He confirms. \"But Missy's just so, and Courtney's so -\" henpauses, searching for the word. \"Irritating?\" I offer. \"Yeah. And Missy's just herself, you know. I don't have to be anyonenelse.\" He sighs. \"Maybe,\" I venture, \"you should tell me why Missy nearly knocked me overnduring her impression of an Olympic sprinter earlier.\" Jan pauses, taking it in. \"I didn't mean her to run.\" \"Of course not.\" I pause. \"She was fast, though.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Really fast.\" \"Right.\" \"So spill.\" \"I slept with Courtney,\" he says, \"Before I ever kissed Missy.\" \"Okay,\" I admit, \"Not really seeing how this is a problem.\" \"Missy asked if anything had happened with Courtney since, like, us. Menand her.\" \"And?\" I prompt. \"I didn't answer.\" He says, banging his head against the wall. \"I didn'tnfucking answer.\" \"Why?\" I'm confused, didn't he just say. \"Since there was us. Since her. I'm counting this from the first time Intouched her. From the first time I wanted her. The first time we -\" Henthrows his hands up in the air, frustrated. It dawns on me. \"The locker room?\" \"Yeah.\" \"After the locker room you and Courtney?\" \"It was a Friday,\" Jan says with a shrug. \"It made sense at the time. Indidn't know what was going on. It could have been nothing. I didn't evennknow exactly how much I wanted to be with Missy until I was there withnCourtney.\" \"What happened?\" \"I went round. There was a movie. Popcorn. Stuff. I was dazed, didn'tnknow what I was doing. On auto-pilot. All night I was on damn auto-npilot.\" He trails off, sounding as confused and out of it as he claims tonhave been then. \"Jan, you have to tell her this stuff. Well, not all of it, but enough tonconvince Missy that you didn't cheat on her. Coz you didn't. You didn'tnJan. You made a bad choice, but it was before all this.\" I pause,nsurveying the scene. \"So why the hell are you sitting in a shower?\" For the first time Jan looks up at me, his face pained, his brow furrowed. \"What are you doing here man?\" I ask emphatically. \"You should be outnthere, chasing your girl, saving your relationship?\" His eyebrows knit together as he tries to process this. \"But she wouldn't listen. She ran off,\" he bumbles in his defense. \"Get up Jan,\" I say, offering a hand, \"Get up and go. Tell Courtney wherenshe can shove it and then go tell Missy about it. There is no point in younbeing here.\" Jan takes the offered hand and pulls himself to his feet. But the motionnis slow, deliberate - it's obvious that he's uncertain, and unwilling tonface either one of the girls. \"Go Jan. Before it gets any worse. Go to Missy and tell her the truth.nThe whole truth. The whole sordid affair. Tell her.\" Jan gives me this screwy look, this half-suspicious, half-amused look. \"Promise me you'll never say stuff like that where people can hear you.\" \"Sure,\" I grin, \"I promise.\" I watch Jan idly scratch his neck. \"Youngonna get out of here or what man?\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" he capitulates, \"I'm gone. I'm gone.\" And with that henstarts to retreat across the room, one hand holding the back of his neck,nand muttering quietly to himself every few steps. I can feel the smile on my face as I watch him leave. My brash confidentnfriend, reduced to a shuffle over a girl. Jan, whose pick up lines havenalways consisted of the crude and the obscene, nervous and edgy when facednwith the prospect of a real relationship. How'll he do it, a cynical voicenin the back of my head asks, can he do it? Yeah, I think as I watch him gather himself as he walks, watch his stridesnlengthen and his back straighten. He can do it. Or at least I hope he can. \"Jan,\" I call, just as he gets to the door. \"Dude?\" \"Don't mess this one up, man. This one's real. She's real.\" \"Yeah,\" he replies so quietly that I strain to catch the words, \"She is.\" And with that, he's gone. Off to face the music. Off to face the world. ******* I don't know what to do. I ran away, far away and I made it home. No onenstopped me. No one chased me, though even if they had they wouldn't havencaught me. No one did anything. And so I'm standing. Standing in the middle of the living room. My tearsnhave long since dried up and I'm left with, what? Anger? Frustration? Hunger? I don't know. Something. Like a zombie, I drop my coat and gym bag on the sofa. Like a sleepwalkernI cross to the stereo and hit play. Music starts. And like a cheerleader I start my moves, working themnthrough in my head, keeping to the beat, keeping to the count. I can feelnmy mind start to slip away as I work through the moves, I'm starting tonrelax, I'm doing nothing, just practicing, letting my body repeat the movesnit knows so well, I'm light, I'm air, I'm - WHAT THE HELL IS CLIFF DOING? He wiggling, and moving his arms and grinning. Mocking me. God I hate mynbrother. \"Bite me.\" Go away. \"Hanging out with the airhead has really sharpened your verbal skills,nhuh?\" \"Screw you.\" \"Said the cheerleader.\" He sneers. And it dawns on me. I'm miserable and what am I doing; grinning like annidiot and waving my arms in the air. This is me, now. Two years ago I'dnbe backflipping in some gym, by myself, always by myself. Now, right now,nI mean, I'm alone, but I'm not by myself - I have a squad, friends. I havenpeople. I don't have Jan. But I have people. Cliff doesn't have people. He doesn't even - Suddenly I have this great desire to make things right, make everythingnright. \"That's right I am a cheerleader, and you're a dumbass. Torrance likesnyou, she likes you.\" \"She has an odd way of showing it\" he sneers. God he's bitter. Doesn't henknow that things aren't always simple? \"Don't be stupid. She broke up with her boyfriend for you.\" \"Yeah?\" He's challenging me and I just can't stand it. How dare he? Likentake a chance man, get out there? \"Look, do us all a favour and get over yourself and tell her how you feel\".n Go and talk to her. Please. Before I smash in your head with my pompoms! \"I thought I had.\" Okay now he's just pissing me off. \"Well do it again, and here's a tip from a cheerleader. Be aggressive, be,nbe aggressive.\" I storm past him up the stairs. When I reach the top I turn, and can stillnsee him standing there, stewing. \"Get over yourself Cliff.\" I yell down. \"Things aren't always simple.nYou've got to give them a chance.\" Cliff glares up at me. \"Sort it out,\" I yell, \"She's worth it.\" \"Yeah,\" comes a voice from downstairs, freezing my angry tirade. \"She is.\" I don't even have to look. I know Jan's standing there, looking up at me.nI don't want to look, I don't want to see - \"Missy\" he says, forcing my eyes to see the pain in his eyes. \"We need tontalk.\"[Chapter 10] Convergence By Redtoes Author's note - Part ten of ten. Though there may be an epilogue and Inhave an idea for a Les ficlet that really should be addressed. Who knows,nif I get a good idea I may make a whole 'nother series about this crew. Disclaimer - They're not mine, at all, ever. They all belong to someonenelse. And I don't get paid for this, so please don't sue. Though if younlike the work I do for free, just think how good I am when there's money onnthe table. You want to hear about how I forgave him, don't you? You want to hear about how at that moment I took him back and forgave thenlies, the deception and the fact he totally and utterly betrayed me andnjust kissed him right then and there. Well. I didn't. ****** \"Jan.\" \"Hey,\" he says, stepping up a stair. \"Can I come up?\" \"Would anything I could say convince you not to?\" I ask rhetorically as henruns up the staircase. I don't move from my stand at the top of thenflight, and he's left standing on the penultimate step, looking up at me. Though it's not really looking up. Considering the extra inches he has onnme height wise I'm just pleased we're on the same level for once. It seems fitting. \"So,\" he says, \"We're doing this here.\" \"Yeah,\" I'm savouring being able to look him straight in the eyes, \"rightnhere.\" \"Okay. Well here it is. I think I might love you. And I think I fuckednup. Majorly.\"nGod I can't catch my breath. \"And I did sleep with Courtney\" Okay, now I'm breathing. Fire. How dare he? \"But that was before, before us. Before I realised that I wanted more thannjust sex. Before I realised I was in love with you. Before.\" And I'm staring at him. \"Before?\" \"Yeah,\" he confirms, stepping forward to cup my face in his hands,n\"Before.\" \"How long before?\" Part of me can't believe this. I'm standing here innfront of this guy who just told me he loved me and that all the crap Inthought was right is in fact wrong, and I'm questioning him. I'mnquestioning it. \"It was before,\" he says, \"who cares how long?\" \"I do.\" \"Then we're gonna need to sit down,\" he smiles shortly. \"This could take anwhile.\" ******* You still think I took him back don't you? You think he told me all about Courtney and how they'd had a \"thing\" fornyears and I took him back because life should have a happy ending and thisnwould be it. I didn't. I listened though. I listened to everything. And then I kissed his cheeknand asked him to leave. And he did. And now we're in Florida, and I'm watching him flirt with other women, \"Heynladies, wanna see my spirit stick,\" and listening to Torrance depress menabout Cliff. I'm being as chirpy as I can be in public, but, and I swear you to secrecynon this, I'm crying in a corner when I'm by myself. But we're in finals. So that's all that matters. Or so I thought. ******* \"Trust on three! One, two - \" \"TRUST!\" ******* \"You know,\" he says as he leans his lanky frame against the metal railingsnthat hold me back from the beach, \"you used to be more fun.\" I'm sitting on the rails, sipping on a coke, watching the waves. I knownTorrance is as close as she can get to the judges without being accused ofnstalking. I suspect Les is trying his very best to flirt with. Tim? Wasnthat his name? I don't know. And here's Cliff, pestering me. \"Buzz off little brother,\" I smile, \"I'm all nervous here.\" He grins. \"You're really not.\" \"No,\" I agree softly, \"I'm not.\" \"You've either won or you haven't,\" he says neutrally. \"Yeah,\" I agree. \"We came, we cheered, now we wait.\" \"You've done more than that,\" he points out resting his elbows on the rail,nstaring out to see. \"I really haven't,\" I object softly, trying not to think about where he'sngoing with this. Don't be talking about Jan. Don't be talking about Jan.nDon't - \"Missy.\" Shit. \"Don't say it Cliff,\" I warn, suddenly tense. \"Why?\" He asks, \"you messed with my love life.\" \"And look what happened.\" \"Yeah,\" but he doesn't sound upset at all. He sounds - \"You're gonna go for it aren't you?\" \"Go for what?\" \"I knew it!\" And I did. \"I knew you didn't fly out here for me.\" \"Hey I had the ticket,\" he shrugs, \"And I'm here, why's it matter who I'mnhere for.\" \"It doesn't.\" But he's gotten over himself, that matters. And he's goingnto take his chance, that matters. That all matters. Jesus. What the hell am I doing? What am I doing? \"Missy!\" I turn, suddenly. Jan. \"Jan.\" I'm neutral, I'm cool, I'm ice. \"Missy,\" he pauses about six feet away uneasily, shifting on his feet.n\"The judges are back. Come on, we gotta go.\" \"Yeah,\" I brush down my clothing as I clamber to my feet. \"Right.\" I watch as he turns away from me, beginning the jog across the broadwalknback to the arena. For a second my heart flips as I watch him move. Allnthat he is, all that energy and enthusiasm and life. And then reality comes crashing back and I have to sprint after him toncatch up, leaving my brother alone to watch the waves. ******* God she looks good. Her hair's down and her skin's flushed and she looksnso good I could just - Do absolutely nothing because I screwed this up two weeks ago. I tried to tell her, you know? Tried to explain. I just couldn't get itnto come out right. I told her everything, laid open my heart, my soul, putnit all out there on the line and she said - \"Jan?\" No actually she said that she hated that I never told her about Courtney.nThat those small lies had become big, and that she just couldn't trust me,ncouldn't be near me. I'd betrayed her. Then she kissed me, softly, gently and I thought there must be somethingnwrong with my ears coz no one says those things then kisses goodbye likenthat. No one except Missy. And she's here standing beside me and it's a physical effort not to bentouching her. \"Jan?\" Not to be kissing her. Not to - \"Jan!\" I look down to see Missy's hand resting against my chest, helping her keepnher distance as she leant in to bring me back to reality. She's touchingnme. I could die happy. \"We need to go out there, don't we?\" She asks, gesturing out into thenarena. Somewhere along the line I paused in this doorway, unwilling tontake those final steps. After this there's nothing. It's over. NonNationals the squad has to be in shape for to force us into dailynpractices. No dynamic to maintain. No reason to see her. I thought I could win her back already. I thought we'd be holding handsnwaiting for the trophy. I thought so many things. \"Yeah,\" I answer her. And then, taking what might well be my last evernchance I hold me hand out to her. \"Let's go.\" Her fingers hover over my skin as her eyes meet mine. She's about tonsmile, she's about to drop her hand in mine and warp her fingers around menwhen - \"Hey Lover.\" Courtney. Who whisks me off in a second, leaving Missy standing there, her hand halfnoutstretched towards my last chance that never was. Damnit. ******nI swear it's like he's trying to give me reasons to hate him. Jogging hand in hand with Courtney across the arena. Bastard. But then Inwas about to take his hand wasn't I? I feel a stab of real pain, followed by the familiar chaser of anger.nIt's almost a comfort, to know I'm still angry, still hurting. It'sndiminishing though, shifting it's focus from Jan, poor confused Jan tonCourtney the evil bitch. Maybe Cliff's little trip is getting to me. He flew 3000 miles to seenTorrance. He came because I told him he should, that she as worth it.nThat she broke up with her boyfriend over him. But first she lied, or atnleast wasn't entirely honest. Flirted with one while dating the other.. God is everything becoming a metaphor for my life? \"Missy! Come on!\" Torrance waves at me from across the stage. \"Come on!\" Plastering a fake smile on I dash across to where our blond captain stands.n Taking my hand we kneel at the front of our group. Coz if there's onenthing that these guys can do it's pose. I swear all they need's a cameransometimes and they're suddenly kneeling or standing or regimented into thenperfect team shot. Its plain freaky. It's - - Now this was a tough decision as there were two outstanding teams thisnyear - What? Huh? Oh yeah, time to win. - from San Diego California, the Rancho Carne Toros! - Or not. I find myself staring at Torrance. We came second. We camensecond.. We came second! \"Second place, hell yeah!\" I hear Courtney scream and for once in my lifenI don't hate her. I'm too busy jumping up with Torrance and screaming asnwe go and grab that big damn trophy that ours. It's ours and we did it allnby ourselves. No Big Red. No stolen routines. No Sparky bloody Pulastri. Us. The Toros. We did it. It's ours. Cliff comes across suddenly, focused on one thing, and though I want to seenthem both happy I just don't want to lose my buzz already, don't want toncome back to reality, and so - \"Les!\" I yell as I move through the crowd. \"Les!\" \"Hey,\" I feel rather than hear this word, his breath against my skinnrather than his word in my ear. And I turn and throw myself into the armsnof - Jan? Jan. Jan who's kissing me, and god I've missed this. \"Jan?\" \"Yeah?\" he says, grinning at me from mere millimetres away. \"Hi,\" I manage. \"Hey,\" he says leaning in again. Leaning in to kiss me, when - \"Jan!\" Oh I know that voice. \"Go away Courtney,\" he says, never once taking his eyes from mine. \"I'mntalking to my girlfriend.\" I sense her seething behind me, and for one second I want to pull away.nYou can have him. He's yours. He screwed me over and I don't want him. And I look up into those warm darks eyes. Screw that. Screw her. So long as I can taste your lips for the next age, I'm happy. \"This doesn't mean we're cool.\" I say the next time we take a breather. \"I know,\" he says, his eyes sparkling, \"but it's a good start right?\" \"Yeah,\" I grin, rubbing my nose against his, \"It's a great start.\"n****** So you happy now? To hear I took him back? To hear I transferred my application from Stamford to UCLA, where he'll be? To hear that two years later we're still going strong and moving into ournown place? To hear that though I gave up cheering, it just wasn't the same without ournsquad, I kept up Gymnastics, even improved as a result of my year withnTorrance and the others? To hear that everything's going well? To hear we're doing fine? To hear we're happy? Yeah. I'm happy to hear that too. ******[Chapter 11] Authors note: most of this series was written last summer and so Inapologise for this final chapter for coming so late.

I think that he was just a guy who wanted to box but he was corrupted, manipulated and drugged by the Russian government. So I wanted to write about what might have happened after he lost…plus he's hot! Vengeance After his defeat at the hands of Rocky Balboa in Moscow, Ivan Drago returns to America and, keeping a low profile, starts to train with small time coach Jim Baxter. To help Ivan adjust to life in America, Baxter ropes in his daughter Jenny to tutor him in English. Separated from her violent boxer husband, babysitting another fighter is a job she doesn't want. But as the pair spend more time together Jenny realises they may be able to help each other more than she thought… Prologue December 26 th 1985 New York City His fist hit the wall, inches from her face, causing her to yelp and jump back. Turning to face him, she saw the familiar fury in his eyes and, mustering every ounce of courage she had left, she squared up to him. \"You fucking piece of shit.\" His mouth trembled with anger at her insolence. \"You walk out that door, Jenny and I'll smash your fucking face in, you hear me?\" It was no idle threat. She knew that he would. She had the memories of the bruises and fractured cheekbones to prove it. \"Go ahead,\" she replied, her voice trembling slightly, \"it's not as if you haven't done it before. That's all you boxers know, isn't it?\" He didn't say anything. \"You think you can solve everything with a punch. You think that's how you get respect. But it's not respect, Dan. It's fear. And fears can be overcome.\" He started to laugh contemptuously, \"Really?\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"really. I've spent the last five years of my life letting you control me and treat me like a punching bag …but not anymore Dan. No more. Now I'm walking out of this door and I'm leaving you and if you want to smash my fucking face in for doing that, then go ahead. But it's not going to change the fact that I'm not afraid of you anymore!\" It was a lie, of course. She was terrified. Perhaps more terrified than she had ever been before. But this time, she knew she had to do it. If she didn't, she would one day die at his hands. She had thought the day before, Christmas Day, might have been that day. A petty argument over the Rocky Balboa – Ivan Drago fight had led to her spending the night wide awake, a kitchen knife under her pillow. Dan moved even closer to her, so close that their faces were almost touching and she could feel his breath on her lips. She thought back to years gone by, when being this close to him made her body weak with desire. There was no desire anymore. There hadn't been for years. Two voices screamed inside her head. One was shouting this is it, he's going to kill you and the other was shouting this is it, you've done it. \"Go,\" he said suddenly, quietly, his eyes sweeping her with a look of utter disdain, \"I'm done with you anyway.\" He moved away from her, creating enough space for her to be able to turn, open the door and get out. Knowing from past experience that turning her back on him was never the safest option, Jenny felt for the door handle behind her, turned it and opened the door. Her eyes never left his face as she reached down to lift the suitcase at her feet. Slowly, she manoeuvred her body out of the door into the hallway, waiting, bracing herself for the moment when he would pounce and smash her head into the wall. It didn't come, but he stepped forward as she stepped back, following her out the door. Sensing freedom was in sight, she backed away from him along the hallway to the stairwell and then, seizing the moment, turned and ran as fast as she could, dragging the suitcase behind her, down and out through the main apartment door into the biting cold wind of a Boxing Day morning. Without looking back again, she sprinted to the car, wrenched open the door, tossed the suitcase in and then jumped into the driver's seat. As she jammed the keys in the ignition, she looked up, in time to see him appear at the main door. He made no move to come towards the car but merely watched as she started up the engine. Go, go! The voice inside her head was screaming even louder than it ever had before. You're free! You've done it! Slamming her foot down on the accelerator, she roared away from the kerb, keeping her eyes forward, her mind focussed on what she was doing. Twenty minutes later, her father opened his front door after her insistent knocking and pulled her into his grateful embrace. December 26 th 1985 Moscow, Russia \"Disgrace to your country! Disgrace to your wife! Disgrace to me!\" He sat, head bowed, as he had since that terrible moment when he had been knocked down in the ring. In the heat of the moment, when he had grabbed Rimsky by the throat at the ringside and screamed at them all that he fought to win for himself, he hadn't considered the consequences of a loss. Hadn't contemplated not been hailed a hero. Hadn't contemplated not being able to live up to the huge image of himself hoisted prior to the start of the fight. But he had been enduring those consequences ever since. Dragged from the ring, battered and bloodied, Nikoli had berated him all the way back to the dressing room, spewed venom at him as he had been examined by the doctor, only ceasing when he and Ludmilla had finally made their way home. Then there had just been the terrible silence as she refused to speak to him and slept in another room. \"After everything that we did for you! All the time, energy and resources spent on you…! You would have be nothing without me! Now you are nothing, Ivan, nothing!\" A day later, Nikoli was still speechless with rage. \"I did my best,\" he said quietly. \"This man…he was…\" \"A man! A little man that you should have knocked out in the first round!\" Nikoli stood in front of him, leaning towards him, pointing his finger in his face as though chastising a child. \"He should have met the same fate as Apollo Creed and yet you let him beat you! I do not know why I wasted my time and money on you!\" \"I am a good fighter.\" \"You are not!\" Nikoli insisted. \"You are a loser, Ivan. You will never fight professionally again in Soviet Union, I will see to that! You have embarrassed me and everyone around you!\" He straightened up and adjusted his tie. \"You would do well to think on that.\" He turned smartly on his heel and headed to the front door, letting it slam shut behind him. Ivan stood and moved to the window in time to see his, apparently, former manager be ushered into a large black car and speed away from the kerb. With him, went everything that had been dreamed of for so long. \"He is right.\" His wife's voice jolted him back to reality. \"Milla…\" he turned to where she was standing at the fireplace, her back to him. \"Don't,\" she said. \"I cannot look at you. I cannot…\" she trailed off. \"Nikoli is right. You should have easily won that fight. You were fit, you were trained, you were ready…\" He stepped towards her and then stopped, recognising that he would receive no solace from her. \"It is not the end,\" he said. \"I can try again. There will be other fights…other men.\" Ludmilla turned to face him, her expression hard, yet betrayed by a lone tear descending down her cheek. \"Don't you see, Ivan? It is the end. Without Nikoli…we have nothing. There is no trainer, no manager, no equipment, no money…\" \"No drugs,\" he interrupted bitterly. \"No needles to be put in me.\" Her eyes hardened and she raised her chin defiantly. \"We knew what we were getting involved in, Ivan. You did not complain when you were told what would happen. You did not flinch when those needles were put in you.\" \"You did not flinch either.\" \"I knew that it was all for your benefit! For your own good! To make you the great champion that I knew you could be!\" \"You did not believe that I could win without Nikoli? Without the drugs?\" He asked her the question he had always wanted an answer to. She didn't reply. \"You did not?\" \"I wanted you to win,\" she said finally. \"I wanted you to move beyond amateur level and become heavyweight champion. Was that so wrong?\" \"But you did not think I could do it without Nikoli.\" Ludmilla lowered her eyes, \"Perhaps. But now I think that you could not do it at all.\" She met his gaze again. \"Because you didn't.\" He strode forwards and gripped her shoulders. \"It will just be us again, Milla. Like it was before. Before Nikoli, before Creed and Balboa. Before any of it. We can start again.\" She shook him off. \"Didn't you hear what he said, Ivan? You will never fight again in Soviet Union. There is no future for you in boxing here. There is no future for us. The embarrassment and disgrace…\" He stared at her, \"You are more concerned about that than being with me?\" \"I am an Olympic champion,\" she said, \"a success. I am sorry…but I don't see how we can be together any longer.\" As she made to move past him, he grabbed her arm to stop her and she swung around, landing a stinging blow on his cheek that hurt more than any punch from Balboa. Instantly, he released her and she hurried away from him. An hour later, as she closed the door behind her, carrying as many of her possessions as she could carry, he made no effort to stop her.[Chapter 2] Thank you so much for all your reviews! I'm glad you like the story so far! Please keep it up. December 31st 1985 New York City Jenny stood at her father's front window watching as fat flakes of snow fell onto the ground. It had started just after breakfast and continued all day so that the street and sidewalk were both covered in a thick, white carpet. Cars navigated each other slowly as people attempted to go about their daily business but she could see that her own car was completely covered and there would be little chance of being able to dig it out if the occasion warranted it. In the far corner of the room, the radio was still playing Christmas songs, even though they day itself had passed. It would soon be a new year. 1986. A new beginning, her father had said. She knew he was right. Freedom from Dan brought endless possibilities to her, but there was also the fear. Fear of the unknown, of being alone again, and of the bitter battle no doubt yet to come. There had been no word from Dan since she had left. No phone calls, no appearances at the door begging for her forgiveness. It was the first time that he hadn't chased her and she didn't know whether to see that as positive or not. Perhaps it meant he would finally accept it was over and yet, in her heart, she didn't believe that he would. \"Dinner's ready!\" Jim called from the kitchen and she turned away from the window and crossed the living room where the smell of her father's roast beef was mouth-watering. \"I hope you're hungry,\" he said as she took her seat, \"I think I might have made a little too much.\" \"A little?\" Jenny echoed, her gaze falling on the heaped plate he placed in front of her. \"I'm still full from Christmas dinner.\" \"Nonsense. You need fattening up.\" He sat down opposite her and opened a bottle of wine. \"I told you before, Jenny, you've been looking much too pale and thin of late. Not that I don't know why.\" \"Let's not talk about it,\" she said quickly. \"If that's what you want.\" \"It is.\" The last thing she wanted, or needed, was her father to start dissecting her relationship with Dan. Though she knew he would always take her side, there was a part of her that felt he blamed her for not leaving before. \"So, are you going to file for divorce?\" Jenny paused and looked at him, \"Didn't I just say I didn't want to talk about it?\" \"All right,\" Jim replied. \"But I just think...\" \"Dad!\" \"Sorry.\" He put his fork down, reached over and squeezed her hand. \"I'm just glad that you're here, that's all. Your mother would be too.\" Her eyes fell on the photograph of her mother on the sideboard. The smiling face was so familiar and yet, in years gone by, her mother had looked perpetually worried every time she had seen her. With a stab of regret, she realised it was because of what she had put her through by staying with Dan. How she wished her mother had been here when she had arrived on Christmas Day. \"You still planning on doing my books?\" Jim asked, jolting her back to reality. \"Of course. Whenever you like.\" \"First few days after the New Year should be pretty quiet. Why don't you come down to the gym with me? Give you something to do before school goes back?\" \"Sure,\" she replied. It wasn't as though she had anything else to do. XXXX He hadn't been back to America since Creed had died. Returning to Moscow after that fateful night had been a blessing. The newspapers had been full of what had happened. The American hero, slain by the Russian invader. Ivan had never intended for Creed to die. He hadn't expected for one moment that his blows would be so deadly. When the reporter had thrust the microphone in his face and asked him what he thought about the injured fighter, he had replied as Nikoli had told him to. He had realised, hours later that it had been the wrong thing to say. As he stood in the line for immigration at Newark Airport, he looked out of the window to where the airport was rapidly becoming more and more obscured by the snow. There had been talk before his plane had left Moscow, that they might have to divert because of the bad weather. He had laughed to himself at how ill-prepared the Americans always were. In Russia, a little snow would not bring everything grinding to a halt the way it did here. His decision to return had been made quickly, mere hours after Ludmilla had left him. What was there for him in Russia anymore? He could go nowhere without being recognised as the man beaten by Balboa. He was pointed at, ridiculed, in the street and on television. The memories of that fight, of how the crowd had suddenly turned against him, were raw and he hoped that here, in New York, he could simply disappear. When he stepped up to the counter and handed over his passport and visa, the man at the desk looked at the photograph, then at him, then back to the photograph again. He studied the other paperwork carefully and Ivan knew that he recognised him. He shifted from foot to foot, hoping the man would hurry up, wanting nothing more than to collect his bags and leave. \"Enjoy your stay,\" the man said, finally, stamping his passport and handing it back. \"Thank you,\" he replied. Lifting his rucksack, he followed the signs for baggage claim and, once his suitcase had been retrieved, he headed for the main airport door. As it opened, he felt the raw, cold sting of the winter air on his face and flurries of snow settled in his hair. If he closed his eyes, he could have been in Moscow. Straight ahead, he saw a line of New York's famous yellow taxis and he hurried forward to the first one in the queue. As he approached, the driver tossed away his lit cigarette and opened the trunk for his bags. \"Where you headed?\" he asked, slamming it closed. Ivan paused. He had no idea. XXXX Jenny had only stayed up to keep her father happy. Dick Clark was on and he insisted she sit with him, drinking brandy and eating peanuts until the ball dropped on Times Square and it was officially 1986. Once all the initial excitement had passed, however, she made her excuses and headed for her bedroom, the room she had occupied as a child, little changed from those days. Outside her window, she could hear laughter and shouting coming from down the street as revellers spilled out of their homes or the nearby bars. Climbing into her bed, she pulled the duvet cover up close under her chin and closed her eyes. She wanted to sleep, to put everything that had happened behind her and to wake in the morning refreshed and ready to grab 1986 by the balls. Twenty minutes later, she admitted defeat, snapped on her bedside light and lifted a magazine. XXXX The hotel was nothing compared to the luxury he had stayed in on his last visit to the country, but it was cheap and anonymous and those were the two most important things to him right now. He had taken the room for three nights, enough time initially, he hoped, to be able to find somewhere more permanent. In a somewhat desolate area of town and with it being New Year's Eve, the noise from outside was incredible. People were shouting, glass was breaking, sirens were wailing...it was just how New York was portrayed on the television. A violent, disordered place. For a while, he lay on his back, staring at the stained, cracked ceiling listening to it all, but eventually he fell into a dreamless sleep, only to be suddenly woken by a banging on his door. He lay, unmoving, presuming it was simply a mistake, but the banging came again, louder and more insistent. Finally, Ivan climbed out of bed and moved slowly over to the door. Glancing through the spy-hole, he could see the figure of a man on the other side. The light directly above his door was broken and the man's face was shrouded in shadow. He banged the door again and Ivan stepped back, unsure as to what to do. He knew he would be able to defend himself from any threat, but such an altercation would surely threaten his wish to remain unknown. He stood, waiting, his heart thumping in his chest, then he moved forward to the door again and peered through the glass. The man was gone. He slipped back into bed and pulled the covers around him, feeling a sudden shiver go through his body. How he wished for the warmth and comfort of another person.[Chapter 3] January 2nd 1986 Jenny shivered as she flipped the lights on, bathing her father's gym in a yellow hue that only served to highlight how desperately it needed painted. One light in the corner started to flicker mercilessly and she suddenly remembered reminding her father to change the bulb before the gym had closed for the holidays. He obviously hadn't done it, which was typical. She loved him to death and when he was immersed in the world of boxing he was a ball of highly charged energy, excitement and anticipation. But he was nothing if not completely and utterly oblivious to maintenance issues. Crossing the floor, the sound of her boots echoed around the room, bouncing off of every wall, comforting her as she reached the office and unlocked the door. Clearly the other thing her father had neglected to do before the holidays was tidy up. Stained coffee cups littered the desk atop un-opened mail, Christmas cards and, more than likely, bills. Sighing, she dropped her bag in the corner and sat down in the worn leather chair that creaked under her weight. It was unlikely that anyone would come into the gym today given it was still technically the holidays so she was guaranteed peace at least to get on with what needed to be done. Her mind flitted briefly to the stack of papers sitting in her room at home just waiting to be graded in time for school going back next week. There was no way she could go back to work without having them done and yet…her mind just wouldn't let her focus on them. They were a symbol of her life. Her other life. The life she had with Dan. The one she was trying so hard to leave behind. She peeled off her jacket and flicked on the ancient coffee machine. There was only one thing to do and that was to engross herself in the accounts of a small, rundown boxing gym. XXXX Ivan replaced the receiver in the cradle and retrieved his money from the slot. It was the third time he had tried to call Ludmilla since he had arrived in New York and no-one seemed willing to divulge her whereabouts. He had tried everyone he knew, everyone she might go to and yet, nothing. \"Ivan, come home,\" his mother had said when he had called to say he was safely in New York. \"What is the purpose of this? Come home to your family. Perhaps then, you and Milla…\" She didn't understand why he needed to do this, and he didn't expect her to. All he could do was reassure her that he was well and that he would phone regularly and that if she heard anything from Ludmilla, she must tell him. Stepping out of the phone booth, he pulled his hooded sweater tighter around him to keep out the chill morning air. People scurried past him in all directions, going about their daily lives, and not one person even so much as glanced at him. It was a relief. Pulling his hood up, he began jogging along the sidewalk, focused once more on his mission for the day. He needed somewhere to train. It had been several days since he had pulled gloves on, punched a bag or done anything remotely linked to boxing and he was starting to feel the ill effects. He could almost feel his muscles withering away beneath his flesh. It was like the drugs they had pumped into him at home. When he stopped training, he started to get withdrawal symptoms. He needed to find a gym. Somewhere out of the way, anonymous, where he could be left in peace simply to clear his head and forget everything that had happened in the past. Perhaps it was too much to ask, but he just wanted to be the man he was before. He kept running, with no real sense of where he was or what direction he should take. The bustle of the main streets gave way to quieter areas and before he knew how far he had run, he found himself in what appeared to be a back alleyway. He paused and looked back they way he had come and yet, nothing seemed to be familiar. Looking up ahead, he saw a tired, grey building nestled between two brown stone buildings, the paint on its exterior flaking, wire mesh on the windows. There was a small sign above the door and, as he moved closer, he was able to make out the grimy picture of two boxing gloves. XXXX Jenny lifted her head and rubbed the back of her neck. A quick glance at her watch and a growl in her stomach indicated it was almost noon. Scattered on the desk in front of her were her father's accounts, mixed in with the un-opened bills. Trying to make sense of it all was starting to give her a headache and she decided that a brisk walk to the local deli and some decent coffee was required before she could even think about doing anything more. As she got to her feet, she heard the sound of the outer door bang. The noise made her jump and as she moved to the door of the office, she wondered who could possibly have decided to come and train. She recognised him immediately. Even though he was dressed so differently, in jogging pants and a hooded jumper, she would have known that face anywhere. It had been plastered all over the television for weeks and the Christmas Day fight had been advertised on billboards the length and breadth of the city. Moreover, she had watched transfixed as Balboa had slowly beaten him down, each round etching a further splinter of defeat on his seemingly flawless skin. He walked towards her, his gait unsure, his eyes darting around the gym as though expecting to be attacked at any moment. From the brash confidence of the man who had fought and killed Apollo Creed, Ivan Drago now looked unsure, scared even. \"Can I help you?\" she asked, surprised at the high-pitched quality of her voice. \"I…\" he looked around, as though wishing no-one else to hear their exchange. \"I look for gym.\" \"Well this is a gym,\" she replied, realising how ridiculous her words were the moment they were out. \"I mean…were you looking for a particular gym?\" Ivan shook his head. \"No. I look to…to train.\" \"Oh…\" Jenny paused. \"Uh….this is my father's gym and I'm sure…I'm sure he'd be happy to let you train here. He's a professional trainer,\" she added. \"I can box here?\" \"Uh…sure. I mean, there's no-one else here right now given it's still technically the holidays but…you're welcome to use the facilities if you want to.\" He frowned, \"Facilities?\" \"Oh, the ring, the weights, the pads…\" she trailed off, feeling her heart thumping in her chest for some inexplicable reason. \"I'm Jenny,\" she held out her hand. \"Ivan,\" he said, taking her hand in his. She was surprised by how gentle his touch was and the softness of his hand. Dan's had always been so rough. \"I know.\" He pulled away first, looking at the floor, as though unable to hold her gaze any longer. \"I can train now?\" \"Of course,\" she said, \"I'll show you where you can change.\" She crossed the gym floor towards the dressing rooms and opened the door. \"There's lockers and showers…uh…make yourself at home.\" \"Thank you,\" he said quietly and she found herself somewhat transfixed by the blueness of his eyes. \"I'll…uh…I'll just be in the office if you need anything,\" she tore her gaze away and, turning, hurried back across the gym into the office where she realised she had been holding her breath. It came out in a rush and she had to hold onto the desk for support. Sitting back down, she lifted the papers she had been reading over and tried to re-focus but her mind was reeling. Ivan Drago. The Ivan Drago was in her father's gym! Moments later, Ivan reappeared from the changing rooms, dressed in shorts, a wife beater and carrying gloves. Jenny watched as he crossed the floor to the nearest punching bag, pulled on the gloves and began training. His face was the picture of concentration as he danced around the bag, landing blow after blow, ducking and diving, as though the bag would suddenly reach out and smash him across the jaw. After a while, he stopped, his body glistening with sweat and, looking across, he met her gaze. \"Shit,\" she swore softly, lowering her head to the papers again. XXXX The girl, Jenny, seemed nice, Ivan thought as he caught sight of her watching him train. She was so different from Ludmilla, smaller, stockier and with a mass of dark brown curls cascading down her back. The oversized sweater she was wearing did nothing for her figure but he somehow found it more pleasing to the eye than his wife's sharp suits had ever been. Her face flashed across his memory and he landed one final, agonising blow to the bag before stopping to catch his breath and look again at Jenny. When she realised that he had seen her watching, she ducked her face out of sight. Rubbing his forearm across his forehead, he made his way across the room to the office door. \"Everything all right?\" she asked, looking up with a smile. \"Yes,\" he replied, taking in the wide brown eyes. \"You have many fighters here?\" \"A few,\" she replied. \"Mostly young boys from the neighbourhood, but a few older ones too.\" \"Your father is trainer?\" Jenny nodded. \"He was very successful in the late sixties, early seventies with some local fighters who made it all the way to national championships. Now…\" she trailed off somewhat wistfully. Ivan cocked his head to one side, \"Do you box?\" \"Me?\" she laughed. \"No.\" \"Not even little bit?\" \"Maybe some sparring every now and then, but not seriously.\" \"You spar with me.\" She looked at him as though he were mad. \"What?\" \"Spar with me,\" he repeated, pointing to the ring. \"We go, now.\" \"I'm not…no,\" she said. \"I mean, I…I…\" \"I be gentle,\" he reassured her, keen for the company. He saw the doubt in her face and realised, almost instantly, what she would be thinking. Apollo's shadow loomed over him. He would never be able to escape the events of that night in Las Vegas. All anyone in America would ever remember him for, was the death of their former champion. \"I understand,\" he said softly, turning away. \"Wait,\" Jenny said, causing him to turn back. \"I…\" Her words were lost as the window on the far side of the room suddenly exploded into a waterfall of glass, causing them both to jump and Jenny to scream as a brick smashed onto the floor and slid across to rest at his feet.[Chapter 4] Thanks for your reviews! Keep them coming! \"Jesus fucking Christ...\" Ivan turned as the words came tumbling from Jenny's mouth, and saw that she had gone deathly pale. \"Jesus Christ...Jesus Christ...\" Before he could say anything, she had hurried over to the far side of the room and then stopped dead, mere feet from the window. Slowly, she began to back away, her fists balled at her side, her body trembling. He moved beside her and looked through the shattered window to the other side of the alleyway where a man stood, angrily grinding a cigarette into the sidewalk. \"Do you know him?\" he asked. Jenny didn't reply. She turned and walked quickly down the corridor to the door, throwing it open and letting in a sharp blast of cold, winter air. He heard the sound of her voice, raised and angry, and slowly followed her to where, although shrouded in shadow, he could see her standing just outside. \"Fucking asshole!\" he heard her shout. \"Fuck you!\" came the response from across the street. \"You really think I was going to let you just walk away?\" Moving slightly to his left afforded Ivan a view of the man. He looked about his own age, dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, a bottle of vodka in his hand. \"I don't want to talk to you, Dan!\" Jenny shouted back. \"I don't want to see you and what the fuck was that?\" she gestured towards the window. \"You don't just walk away from me, Jenny,\" the man said, crossing and standing right in front of her. His voice lowered so that Ivan couldn't hear what he was saying but though he could sense Jenny's unease, she squared up to him. \"Go away,\" she said, loudly and clearly. \"I left you. It's over!\" She turned away but the man grabbed her arm, swinging her back around to face him. Ivan was poised to reveal himself when Jenny swung her fist and caught the man a sharp, stinging blow to the jaw. He reeled and staggered backwards, his hands at his face, his eyes wide with shock. \"Get the fuck away from me,\" she said, and he could hear her voice shaking. \"It's over!\" \"Do you know him?\" Ivan asked, as she hurried back inside, closed the door and bolted it firmly. \"My husband,\" she said, refusing to meet his gaze. Moving past him back into the gym she started wandering aimlessly between the bags, one hand continually coursing through her hair, the other pinching her bottom lip. He could feel the tension coming off her in waves and he stood helplessly at the door, unsure what to say or do. \"Can I...uh...do anything?\" \"Short of killing him for me, no.\" She stopped the moment the words had left her mouth and looked at him for the first time. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by that...I...\" she broke off. \"It's...it's complicated.\" Ivan chose to ignore the implication in her comment and pointed towards the changing rooms, sensing that it would be better if he left. \"I go?\" \"Uh...yes...yes if you want to,\" Jenny replied, distractedly, turning and heading back for the office. He watched as she sat down heavily in the chair and put her hand on the receiver of the phone. He waited, but she didn't lift it, instead lowering her head onto the desk in front of her. Mindful of his situation, he made his way back into the changing rooms, showered quickly and pulled back on his street clothes. As he re-emerged into the gym, he saw her replace the phone receiver. \"I go,\" he said. Jenny looked up, as though seeing him for the first time, and stood up to come towards him. \"I'm sorry about that,\" she said carefully, \"You shouldn't have had to see that.\" \"He is not nice man.\" \"No, he isn't.\" He waited, wondering if she would say more, but she simply pursed her lips together and looked at the floor. \"You will be all right?\" \"I'll be fine, thank you,\" she replied. \"You're...you're welcome to come here and train any time. My father usually charges a fee but you can discuss that with him when...if...you come back.\" \"Thank you,\" he replied. \"Well...goodbye.\" \"Bye.\" He turned and made his way back down the corridor to the door, unbolted it and slipped back out into the chilly air. There was no sign of the man, Jenny's husband, and as he made his back towards the main street, he knew he would definitely return. XXXX It was only once he had gone that Jenny felt able to break down. She sank to the floor next to the ring, sobbing, her body shaking with a mixture of fear and anger. Given the time that had passed, she had convinced herself that Dan had accepted the finality of the situation. Accepted that their marriage was over. Accepted that she had really and truly left him. His display of anger, however, made her realise that those thoughts had been foolishly premature. She pressed the heels of her hands into her eyeballs until she could see spots dancing in her vision. She had never raised her hand to her husband, other than in self defence when he had had her pinned to the floor. It had felt good, seeing the look on his face and yet she worried that it made her no better than him. \"Jenny?\" the door suddenly opened and her father appeared. \"Jenny, what the hell happened?\" He dropped to the floor beside her and pulled her into his arms, letting her cry against his shoulder. \"Is he still here?\" \"No. I mean... he didn't come inside.\" \"Why the hell did you go out?\" \"Because he smashed the fucking window!\" she exclaimed, pulling back. \"I can replace the window, Jenny, but I can't replace you,\" Jim said, pushing her hair back from her face. \"You're still my little girl, remember. Did you call the cops?\" \"No.\" \"Jenny...\" \"Dad, please don't start,\" she pulled away and got to her feet. \"You know what happened when I called them before, nothing. They didn't even talk to him, so what's the point?\" \"The point is,\" Jim said, scrambling up beside her, \"you've left him. You're not a wife too terrified to report her husband anymore. You're a woman who's made an important decision to leave him. Dan has to know that he can't get away with this!\" \"Then you call them,\" she said, \"report the window.\" \"They ain't going to do much about a broken window,\" Jim mused, \"especially with no other witnesses.\" \"Oh...\" she suddenly remembered, \"but there is another witness. Ivan Drago was here.\" Jim stared at her, \"Who?\" \"Ivan Drago.\" She laughed at his expression in spite of herself. \"I'm serious.\" \"Ivan Drago,\" Jim repeated. \" The Ivan Drago?\" Jenny nodded. \"He said he was looking for somewhere to train. To be honest, he looked more like he was looking for somewhere to hide.\" \"Well, is he coming back?\" Jim asked, his eyes suddenly alive with excitement. She sighed, \"After what happened with Dan, I doubt it.\" XXXX Ivan peeled some banknotes from the bundle in his pocket and handed them over to the woman at the desk. His quest to find a more permanent living arrangement had so far come to nothing given that most places were still closed for the holidays and he found himself forced to stay at the hotel for another few nights. The woman eyed him suspiciously as he passed her the money and he wondered if she recognised him or simply thought it odd that a tall, well built Russian was staying in the hotel. \"You had a phone call,\" she said, as he turned to leave. \"Telephone call?\" he asked, turning back. \"Yeah, some woman...\" she squinted at a piece of paper on the desk in front of her. \"Lud...Ludm...\" \"Ludmilla?\" Ivan asked eagerly. \"Sounds like it,\" the woman said, scrunching up the paper and tossing it in the waste bin under the desk. \"Anyway, she said to stop calling.\" Ivan felt his heart sink at her words. \"Stop...calling?\" \"That's what she said. I think. Her accent was kind of hard to understand, but that was about the long and short of it.\" He frowned, \"The long...?\" \"That's what she said,\" the woman said, in a tone that indicated she was wishing the conversation was over. \"Thank you,\" he said softly, turning away and heading for the stairs. When he reached his room, he closed and locked the door and then, as anger overtook him, he punched it once, hard. The sound was deafening and he couldn't help but remember that day when he had welcomed the world's media to his training centre and Ludmilla and Nikoli had showcased his incredible strength. Back then... He didn't want to think about it. That life was gone.[Chapter 5] Sorry for the delay in updating. Thanks for all your reviews and messages. Keep them coming! January 3 rd 1985 \"Oh my God Jenny! You must have been so scared!\" \"I guess,\" Jenny replied, twirling the phone cord around her fingers. \"But you know what, Rosa? I was angry too. Angry at the fact that he thought he could just turn up and smash the window like it was nothing.\" \"So what did you do?\" \"Well...I went outside and punched him.\" She smiled at the sudden silence on the other end of the phone. \"He deserved it.\" \"Holy crap...\" Rosa breathed. \"Jenny, you were lucky he didn't turn around and knock the hell out of you!\" \"I know...\" \"Jesus...\" \"It's not exactly something I'm proud of but...\" \"But...?\" \"But it felt good at the time.\" \"You are insane,\" Rosa chuckled. \"Have you graded those papers yet?\" Jenny glanced over her shoulder at the stack of papers still sat on the kitchen table. \"Not yet.\" \"We go back to work the day after tomorrow!\" \"I know and I'll get them done. It's just...\" she broke off. \"It's just what?\" \"Nothing. Listen, that's my dad back. I'd better go and heat up some supper for him. I'll speak to you later, ok?\" \"Ok, but you be careful, Jenny.\" \"I will.\" Jenny replaced the receiver and smiled at the concern of her closest friend. Rosa had seen her through every fight with Dan. Cried with her, helped her cover her bruises with makeup and given her a bed for the night when she hadn't wanted to worry her parents. She couldn't blame the other woman for being concerned. \"Hey,\" Jim said, opening the front door and stepping into the living room. \"What's for supper?\" \"Meatloaf,\" she replied, getting up off the chair and padding into the kitchen. \"Leave your boots outside!\" She switched on the gas and glanced at the heavy snow still covering the ground outside. \"It's cold enough to freeze hell over out there,\" Jim said, coming in behind her and switching on the kettle. \"You get any of that grading done?\" \"Ummm...well I moved some papers around, put them in order, that kind of thing.\" \"That's a no then.\" \"I'll bring them to the gym tomorrow and do them all in one go,\" she replied, peering into the oven. \"So...did he turn up?\" \"No,\" Jim replied and she could hear the wistfulness in his voice. \"I stayed open that extra half hour just in case but no sign.\" \"Well he didn't exactly get the best impression yesterday,\" she conceded. \"Can't hardly blame him if he went elsewhere.\" \"Guess not. It would have been good for business though, to have a proper fighter in the place.\" \"I know,\" Jenny sighed and put a hot plate down in front of him. \"Maybe he'll come back tomorrow.\" \"Maybe,\" Jim said. \"Maybe.\" XXXX \"You gotta be kidding me if you think I'm letting you stay here another night after what you did to my goddamn door! This is your last stop, buddy. Now get the hell out of my hotel!\" Ivan stood, staring at the woman in front of him, unsure what to say. The large dent in the bedroom door was obvious to everyone and yet, he hadn't expected to be thrown out. \"Where I go?\" he asked. \"That's your problem! You sure as hell ain't staying here!\" She crossed her arms across her chest and glared at him. \"What? You not understanding me, Ruski?\" Ivan grabbed his clothes where they lay on the bed and began stuffing them into his bag, humiliation washing over him. The woman was shouting so loudly that he was sure everyone else in the hotel could hear his disgrace. He felt his cheeks burn and knew that had she been a man, he would have struck her. Straightening up, he faced her. \"My money.\" \"You ain't getting a cent back from me,\" she snorted, \"and you're lucking I ain't demanding more from you to fix that door!\" \"But I pay you for three more nights!\" he insisted. \"I need money back!\" \"And I told you, you ain't getting anything back from me!\" She squared up to him, miniscule in stature and yet a giant in her fury. \"Now get out before I get someone to drag you out!\" In his mind, Ivan weighed up his options. He could refuse to leave and take his chances with whoever she might call on to remove him, or he could simply leave and start again. He elected to take the second option and as he hurried past her down the stairs, he could hear her taunts follow him until he was back out on the street. Darkness had fallen, as had the temperature and he pulled her coat tighter around himself. As he stared up and down the street, he realised that he had nowhere to go and no money. He knew no-one. No-one that could help him. He started walking just as the snow started to fall again and, like before, he suddenly found himself on a familiar looking street. Peering into the darkness, he could make out the sign above the gym where he had been two days earlier. As he drew nearer, he saw that it was in darkness and, after knocking loudly on the locked door without answer, realised that clearly there was no-one there. As he turned to walk back up the street, he suddenly caught sight of a wooden board, covering the window that the man had smashed when he had been there before. One corner of it was not nailed down properly and was banging in the chilly breeze. He realised that if he could somehow get in through the window, he would at least have somewhere to stay for one night. Slinging his bag across his body, he dragged a nearby trash can underneath the window and stood on it. It gave him the height to attempt to pull the board away from the window at both bottom corners, creating a flap which allowed him to pull his body up and under. The broken glass had been removed and he was able to slide in through the opening and drop down into the gym. The noise when he landed reverberated around him and he paused, waiting for someone to come and challenge him. But there was no-one. Afraid to turn on the lights, he moved forward in the darkness until he reached the door to the office that the girl, Jenny, had been sitting in. Pushing the door, he found it was unlocked and he stepped inside to where there was relative warmth. Sighing, he put his bag on the ground and prepared to settle himself in for the night. January 4 th 1985 Jenny unlocked the door of the gym and manoeuvred her way inside, balancing all of her papers in her arms. She had woken early and left a note for her father saying she was going to get a head start on her grading and that she would see him there later that morning. Flipping the lights on, she realised that he still hadn't gotten around to changing the bulb and shook her head. It had been the last thing she had said to him before he had left the house the previous day but, as usual, it had gone in one ear and out the other. As she opened the office door and switched the light on, a shape suddenly moved in the corner, starting her and she stepped back quickly, a scream about to burst forth from her mouth when she realised who it was. Ivan leapt to his feet and put out his hands, almost as if he were afraid she was going to attack him. \"I'm sorry,\" he said hurriedly. \"I did not mean to...\" \"What the hell are you doing here?!\" she exclaimed, her hand going to her chest where she could feel her heart thumping beneath her coat. \"You scared the shit out of me!\" \"I'm sorry,\" he said again. \"I...\" \"How did you get in here?\" \"The window,\" he gestured behind her, \"I...I was looking for place to stay and...\" he trailed off. \"So you thought you'd break into our gym?\" \"No, I...I'm sorry,\" he turned and lifted his belongings from the floor. \"I should not have...I go now...\" \"Wait!\" She stepped in front of him. \"I don't understand. Why were you looking for a place to stay? Don't you have somewhere?\" Ivan looked at the floor. \"I was asked to leave. They keep money and I could not find anywhere else. I remembered you and thought, maybe, you help me.\" As her heart rate returned to normal, Jenny felt her initial anger begin to dissipate to be replaced by curiosity. Ivan Drago, a great fighter, reduced to breaking into a rundown gym to sleep on the floor? \"Have you been here all night?\" He nodded. \"You must be hungry.\" He looked away, \"I...\" \"Look...why don't you take a shower and then I'll take you for breakfast.\" \"You do not need to. I can go...\" \"You at least owe me a little conversation after scaring me half to death,\" she insisted. \"Just let me call my father and then we can go, ok?\" Ivan nodded. \"Ok.\" He moved past her, out of the office, towards the showers. As he glanced back over his shoulder, she waved him on with her hand and, seconds later, he found himself standing under a hot shower, gratefully allowing the water to run over his body and ease his muscles, strained from hours lying on the floor. He was relieved that her reaction, although initially hostile, appeared to be becoming more favourable. After showering, he dried himself, put on clean clothes and stepped back out into the gym where Jenny was standing staring at the broken window. He came to stand beside her and followed her gaze. \"I am sorry about window. The wood was not...\" he fought for the right words. \"It was not...uh, how you say...?\" \"Secure?\" she finished for him. \"Yes, secure. I was able to...\" he recreated the motion of pulling the wood from the window with his hands. \"I get the picture,\" Jenny said. \"I called my father and he'll take care of it. He's dying to meet you,\" she added, walking towards the door. \"He'll come by later, once he's picked himself off of the floor.\" \"Did he fall?\" Ivan asked, as she opened the door for him. Jenny laughed, \"Not exactly.\" XXXX The cafe was quiet with only a few customers dotted around at tables. Jenny, for one, was glad of the peace. There were questions that she wanted to ask Ivan, something that wouldn't be readily possible if the place had been full of boxing fans. They both ordered full breakfasts from a waitress who looked as though she wouldn't have recognised him if he had been the President. \"So,\" Jenny said, when they were alone again. \"Why don't you have anywhere to stay?\" \"I punch door,\" Ivan replied, making the motion with his fist. \"They don't like that.\" \"I'm not surprised. Was there a particular reason or were you just sparring with yourself?\" He looked down at the table top. \"My wife, Ludmilla. She call and tell me to stop calling. I get angry and...\" \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"You don't have to tell me anymore if you don't want to.\" Ivan shrugged his shoulders. \"She leave after fight with Balboa. She want to be with champion and I am not champion.\" He glanced up from under hooded eyelids. \"You see fight?\" She nodded. \"Then you know.\" \"Balboa's a good fighter,\" she said. \"You did your best.\" \"Even with drugs, I don't beat him.\" Jenny shifted uncomfortably in her seat. \"Well...I suppose that different countries have different ways of...\" \"No,\" he said sharply, meeting her gaze again. \"It wasn't right. But I do what I am told, always. I am told to fight Creed and I do it. Balboa want to fight me, so I do it. I do it for Nikoli and Milla.\" He sat back in his chair. \"Now I have nothing.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Not your fault. You see me as Russian, as killer.\" \"That's not...\" she broke off, knowing that it would be a lie to disagree. She had thought him a killer after the fight with Creed, a robot who cared nothing for his dying opponent at the ringside. She had joined in the conversations down-crying him, and cheered lustily for Balboa. But now, sitting opposite the man, she found him to be something she hadn't considered before. She found him to be human. The waitress appeared at that moment with their food and there was an enforced moment of silence. \"I suppose people aren't always what you think they are.\" Ivan speared a tomato with his fork and looked at her. \"You hit your husband?\" \"I've never done that before,\" she replied. \"At least not when he hasn't been hurting me first. He's a boxer too and rather than practice in the ring, he liked practicing on my face.\" She smiled at the expressed look of surprise that comment produced from Ivan. \"That's the look I get from people when they find out I was a battered wife. Either that or pity.\" She chewed on some toast. \"But I left him. The day after your fight, actually. When he came to the gym the other day...that was the first time I had seen him since I left. I wondered how he was taking it and now I know.\" \"You will go back?\" \"No,\" she said hurriedly, \"I'll never go back.\" She watched him for a long moment. \"Will you go back to Russia?\" Ivan paused. \"One day, I will have to.\" XXXX \"You know...\" Jenny said thoughtfully as they made their way back down the street towards the gym. \"There's a bedsit above the gym that no-one's using right now.\" \"Bedsit?\" \"Yeah, it's like...it's like a whole house in one room. There's a bed, couch, small kitchen and bathroom. It's not exactly in liveable condition at the moment but...you could probably stay there just now if you needed to.\" \"I don't want to...\" \"It's better than you sleeping on our office floor,\" she said. \"I'm sure dad won't mind. Not once he's met you and told you what a great fighter he thinks you are.\" Ivan looked at the ground again. \"He will not say that.\" \"Don't be so sure. Come on, I'll introduce you.\" As she reached out and grabbed the handle, Ivan's hand suddenly covered her own. She looked at it and then back at him. \"I don't know why you help me,\" he said, \"but...I thank you.\" \"Don't worry about it,\" she replied, her voice coming out more high-pitched than she intended. \"Maybe you can teach me to hit better.\" Ivan smiled as she opened the door. \"You need no help there.\"[Chapter 6] Gosh, it has been so long since I last updated this! I'm not sure if anyone is still interested, but here's a new chapter! Please review if you can! As soon as they went inside, Jenny could hear the sound of gloves hitting pads and realised that there were others there. Walking into the body of the gym she recognised two young boys from the neighbourhood sparring in the ring and prayed they wouldn't say anything unexpected. At first, they seemed oblivious but as she and Ivan walked towards the office, they suddenly stopped what they were doing and stared. Jenny glanced at Ivan and saw a look of uncertainty mar his features, but they were saved by Jim rushing out of the office, excitement lighting up his face like a child at Christmas. He hurried forward to greet them, extending his hand to Ivan as he did so. \"Dad this is Ivan,\" Jenny said, somewhat redundantly. \"Ivan, my father Jim Baxter.\" \"A pleasure to meet you,\" Jim said enthusiastically pumping Ivan's hand. \"An absolute pleasure! To think, you chose our gym to train in!\" Ivan glanced over at her with an expression that screamed confusion, but she merely smiled and nodded encouragement at him. \"I am sorry about last night,\" he said slowly. \"I did not mean to cause trouble or...\" \"Nonsense,\" Jim waved his hand dismissively. \"I'm only sorry we didn't know you were in need of a place to stay. You would have been most welcome here, most welcome.\" \"I mentioned to Ivan about the bedsit,\" Jenny said, lowering her voice so that the boys wouldn't hear her. \"He doesn't have anywhere else to go at the moment and it's lying empty...\" \"Not in the best of conditions,\" her father interrupted her. \"I know, but I'm sure that we could make it liveable.\" \"I do not want to cause problem,\" Ivan interrupted. \"Oh it's no trouble, no trouble at all!\" Jim enthused. \"In fact, Jenny why don't you show Ivan up there now? I've got some work to do with Tony and Frank here,\" he gestured to the two boys who were still staring open-mouthed. \"Ok,\" Jenny said, \"It's just this way.\" She led Ivan through towards the back of the gym and out of a door in the corner which led into an overgrown courtyard. A flight of rickety steps to their right led up to another door above them but when she put the key in the lock and turned it, she found that the door refused to open. \"Just a sec,\" she said, pressing her body against it to no avail. \"I can get it, just hang on...\" \"Let me try,\" Ivan said, gently touching her shoulder. Feeling a jolt go through her body, Jenny stepped to one side and, with seemingly little effort, he pushed the door open. \"\"I wasn't really trying that hard anyway,\" she joked, but the look of confusion on his face made her realise that he didn't understand her humour. \"So, this is it,\" she said, stepping inside and immediately wrinkling up her nose at the musty smell. \"It hasn't been used for a while and it's a bit of a mess, but I'm sure we can fix it up for you.\" She moved over to the window and pulled open the curtains, coughing violently as dust flew at her. \"I can sort that with the vacuum.\" Surveying the room for the first time in so long, she cringed at how bad it really looked. There was a bed pushed up against the far wall, a dining table with four uneven legs that meant it sat at an unusable angle and the yellow units in the small galley style kitchen were lined with grime. Two rickety looking chairs completed the set up and Jenny found she couldn't even bring herself to look in the bathroom. \"Look,\" she said, \"it's worse than I thought it was so if you really don't want to stay here...\" \"It is fine,\" he replied quietly. \"Ivan, it's a shithole.\" \"No,\" he looked at her and she saw the genuine gratitude in his eyes. \"It is not shithole. It is good.\" \"Well...\" she put her hands on her hips. \"I guess it's nothing a good clean can't sort out.\" XXXX \"I figured you workers could use some refreshments,\" Jim declared three hours later as he appeared at the door with a tray bearing three cups of coffee. \"I have to say...you've done a good job so far.\" \"Dad, the place still looks horrendous,\" Jenny turned around from where she had been scrubbing the kitchen and pushed her hair out of her eyes. \"Rather Ivan than me staying here.\" She tossed her cloth into the sink and gratefully came to lift a cup. \"Where is he anyway?\" \"In the bathroom, grappling with the shower. Hang on I'll get him.\" The bathroom door was closed over and when she pushed it open and went inside, the first place her eyes went was his naked back, stretched as it was over the bath, glistening with sweat from the effort of cleaning. \"Hey,\" she said, her voice coming out much higher pitched than she had intended. \"There's coffee out here for you.\" He straightened up so as to be facing her and she couldn't help admire the contouring of his abs, the perfect formation of his pecs and the strong muscles in his shoulders. \"It's...it's here when you want it.\" Turning, she hightailed it back out into the living area where Jim was peering at the carpet, oblivious. Moments later Ivan appeared, his wifebeater now covering what, seconds earlier, she had been stunned by. Wordlessly, he lifted a cup from the tray and sipped it, his eyes on her. \"What's wrong with the carpet?\" she asked, eager to distract herself. \"Reckon it needs replaced,\" Jim replied. \"But it should be all right for now.\" He grinned at Ivan. \"What do you think?\" \"I think it nice,\" Ivan replied. \"How I pay?\" \"Oh, don't worry about that,\" Jim said, waving his hand dismissively. \"I must pay. I have...little money but...\" \"It's not a problem...\" \"No!\" he said, stronger this time, causing them both to look at him. \"I must... I must...\" Clearly unsure of the English, he reverted to his native tongue, stopping only when he saw they didn't understand him. \"I am sorry.\" \"It's ok,\" Jenny reassured him, glancing at her father. \"Dad, maybe Ivan could help you in the gym? I'm sure there's lots of kids round here that could benefit from training with him.\" When she looked back, however, Ivan looked somewhat stricken at the prospect. \"Unless...you don't want to do that?\" \"It's not...I...\" he struggled for words again. \"I am known for...for killing. I don't want...\" he trailed off, his eyes begging with them to understand. \"No-one is going to think anything about that,\" Jenny insisted. \"I promise. Besides, we wouldn't let anyone coming to this gym treat you with anything other than respect.\" \"Of course not,\" Jim added. \"So, what do you say?\" Ivan looked between them, at Jim's eager expression and at Jenny's reassuring one and nodded. \"I say yes.\" XXXX Jenny had hoped that sleep would come easily that night. Her alarm was duly set for six am the following morning, ready to rouse her into the first day back to school and she knew that if she didn't get at least seven hours, she would be the crankiest one of them all, never mind the kids. Lying in the dark, she stared at the ceiling, willing her eyelids to droop but instead found herself feeling wide awake. His face, his body loomed before her, the image of him standing in front of her, his bare skin inches from her, burned the back of her eyelids every time she tried to invite sleep. She could imagine lifting her hand, placing it gently on his chest, her fingers tracing shapes in the sweat. Then she saw his body moving closer to hers, her nipples hardening at the sensation of his hands finding her waist and drawing her into him. His mouth on her neck as she felt his hardness through his pants... \"Jesus...\" she whispered, sitting upright in the bed. \"Get a grip!\" Ruefully, she had to admit that it had been so long since she had experienced anything approaching good sex than she had started to forget what it felt like. Latterly, with Dan, she had acquiesced out of fear, Rosa's stark words echoing in her head every time. \"He's basically raping you, Jenny.\" Shaking the demons of the past from her subconscious, she got out of bed and padded into the living room to get a drink, only to be surprised at the sight of her father sitting in the chair by the fire, peering at the television, the volume almost muted. \"What are you doing?\" she asked, causing him to jump. \"You almost gave me a heart attack!\" Jim exclaimed. \"I couldn't sleep but I didn't want to wake you.\" He peered at her. \"What are you doing up?\" \"I can't sleep either,\" she admitted, flopping down onto the couch and pulling her legs up underneath her. \"What are we watching?\" \"I have no idea. I switched it on about ten minutes ago and I've been trying to work that out ever since.\" He clicked the picture off. \"You want some hot milk?\" Hot milk...it was like being a kid again when she couldn't sleep. She would go through to her parents room and waken her mother who never chastised her, but would simply lead her into the kitchen, make her hot milk and sit with her in the big armchair until she fell asleep. She would wake the next morning, back in her own room with no recollection of how she got there. \"I should be making it for you, \" she joked, getting up and walking into the kitchen. \"I'm not completely helpless,\" Jim protested, following her. But he put up no argument as she pulled a saucepan from the cupboard and switched on the gas. \"You think Ivan's ok back at the gym?\" Jenny paused, her mind going back to him. \"I'm sure he appreciates the bedsit more than the floor of the office.\" \"He seems a nice guy,\" Jim mused. \"Not what I thought at all.\" \"What did you think he'd be like?\" \"I don't know. Perhaps more like how the news portrayed him. Unable to think for himself...cold...calculating...but he doesn't seem like that at all.\" \"No,\" she agreed, pouring the milk into the pan. \"Not at all.\" XXXX Ivan too was struggling with sleep. The bedsit was comfortable enough and he was grateful for the Baxters' generosity but something...something just wouldn't let him rest. Eventually, having stared at the ceiling for what felt like hours, he got out of bed and went to stand at the window that overlooked the courtyard below. Save for the moonlight, it was in complete darkness and the trees swaying in the night breeze only served to give the place an eerie atmosphere. He wasn't a man to scare easily, for he knew he could defend himself if needs be, but he couldn't help but think that there were people out there, waiting for him, waiting to hurt him. As he turned away to head back to bed, his attention was caught by a shape moving at the far corner of the building. At first he thought he had imagined it, but as he continued to watch, he saw the shape of a person creeping around the corner and peering towards the back door of the gym. The figure was dressed all in black, but as he turned his face upwards, Ivan saw the familiar features of the man who had thrown the brick through the window, the man Jenny had said was her ex-husband. For a moment, he wondered what to do. There was no phone in the bedsit and, even if there had been, he had no means of contacting him. There could be no other purpose for her husband to be there other than to cause trouble. Taking a deep breath, he slipped his feet into his running shoes and opened the door.[Chapter 7] Hello folks! Once again, I'm so sorry for not updating for a long time. I'm now on maternity leave having had my wee boy 7 months ago and thought I would have lots of time to write. How wrong I was! I do want to finish this story (still a long way to go!) and I was watching some Dolph the other day and just got the mojo back. Hope you enjoy it and please review if you can! January 5 th 1986 Dan had thought about going to the house to confront her. After all, he was a direct man who preferred the one on one approach. Sneaking around in the dark wasn't usually his thing. But he also knew that Jim, although past his best, could still land a pretty mean right hook and that when it came to his daughter, he no doubt wouldn't hesitate to do so. Dan had known for years that Jim didn't like him, most likely from the first time he saw a bruise grace Jenny's face. Accidents. They had all been accidents, mistakes, transgressions that he had apologised to Jenny for and she had graciously accepted. But not this time. This time, after their fight at Christmas, she had walked away. Packed her bags and left. No-one did that to him, least of all her. His mother had never walked away from his father and he would be damned if his wife walked away from him. He balled his fists at his sides to stop himself from punching the wall. His last approach had been stupid. Coming to the gym tanked up on vodka...he had been an easy target for her to land a lucky punch of her own. He had been surprised but, in some ways, it had also been a massive turn on. If things had been different, if they hadn't been in the middle of the street, if they had been inside he knew, as sure as he knew anything, that that punch would have led to some incredible sex. Jenny was nothing if not predictable. This was his next best option. Hit her and her father where it would hurt. Their precious gym. Once a place where many an up and coming fighter would train, himself included, now a rundown ghost of its past. And yet, they loved that place, kept it going, flogging the dead horse. He didn't know why. What was the point in sentiment? Not when there were shiny new gyms in the city to take over. Slipping the crowbar out from under his jacket, he levered it against the lock until it easily cracked and the door sprang open. There was no sudden burst of wailing alarms, no security guard shouting at him. There was nothing except the wind. Pathetic, he thought, as he lifted the can and slipped inside. In reality, he was doing them a huge favour. XXXX By the time he got down into the courtyard, Dan had vanished and, for a moment, Ivan wondered if he had imagined the whole thing. Perhaps he was starting to hallucinate, seeing enemies everywhere he went. Then he heard a soft thud, as though a door had closed without catching properly and, turning, he saw the back entrance to the gym slightly ajar. Clenching and unclenching his fists, he moved towards the door, trying to stay as silent as possible. Although he hadn't seen a weapon, it didn't mean the other man might not be carrying one. Quietly, he pulled the door open and slipped inside, making sure that he closed it behind him, before making his way slowly down the corridor towards the main gym. Although it was dark, the moon was full, giving him enough light to be able to see where he was going. As he drew nearer, he heard a clattering sound, as though something had been dropped, and he caught sight of a figure in the far corner. Ducking behind one of the bags, Ivan watched as he began emptying liquid out of a can onto the door and walls, moving along and across towards the ring. An acrid smell filled the air, one that Ivan instantly recognised as gasoline. His purpose became all too clear and, without giving it further thought, Ivan stepped out from behind the bag. \"Ostanovis! Stop!\" Dan jumped and swung around to face him, the can falling from his hand and rolling across the floor. \"What the fuck...?\" He peered in the dim light. \"Who the fuck are you?\" \"You should leave,\" Ivan said. \"I don't know who you are, but this has nothing to do with you!\" Dan said, his hand going into his pocket. \"So if you know what's good for you...\" he paused and frowned. \"Wait a minute...I do know who you are.\" Ivan stepped forward again, hoping this might give him some form of advantage. \"Then you should leave.\" \"You're Ivan Drago!\" Dan exclaimed incredulously. \"Ivan Drago! In this fucking hellhole? The Siberian Express! Death From Above!\" he walked up to him and started laughing. \"Knocked out by a small Italian! Way to go, big guy! You know, I box. I mean, I'm not exactly heavyweight champion of the world but I reckon that even I could have beat Balboa...\" He stopped suddenly. \"But, what are you doing here? Are you working with Jim? Don't tell me you left Russia to come here and work with him? Fuck me, times must be hard! But then, I guess you're not exactly flavour of the year as far as the old Ruskis are concerned...\" Ivan knew he shouldn't have reacted. He had never reacted, not in the days since his defeat. When he had been browbeaten by Nikoli, Milla, everyone...he hadn't reacted. He had accepted the criticism, taken it as best he could and internalise the feelings. Now, faced with this...man...this man that he knew could hurt...someone...he felt himself lash out, a stinging blow catching Dan across the face and sending him sprawling backwards. Dan leapt quickly back to his feet, his hand to his mouth and Ivan felt himself tense into fighting stance. He had fought no-one since Balboa, hadn't even considered another fight, but as Dan rushed at him, he knew he had no choice. XXXX Jenny's first concern, when she ran into the gym, wasn't for the fixtures and fittings and it certainly wasn't for Dan. When the phone had shrilled through the house in the early morning, waking her from a dream the details of which she couldn't now remember, and her father had answered it, something inside her had just known that he was involved. Part of her, the dark part that she would never admit to, had half hoped it had been the police to say that he had died, but as Jim had relayed the story of a break in and a fight, she had realised that she would never be that lucky and found herself suddenly desperate to know if Ivan was safe. Through the throng of people that had gathered, police, emergency personnel and curious bystanders, she only sought one person and felt relief flood her when she caught sight of him sitting at the edge of the ring having his hand bandaged. \"Are you all right?\" she demanded, skidding to a stop beside him. \"What the hell happened?\" \"Looks like a cracked knuckle,\" the EMT answered before Ivan could speak. \"Ice and bandages for a few days and it should be fine.\" He gestured over his shoulder. \"Looks like he came off the worst.\" Jenny turned to where a battered and bloodied Dan was having steristrips attached to a cut on his forehead, a police officer flanking him. His expression was surly, his gaze fixed on Ivan. She had seen that look so many times during their life together and she felt an involuntary shiver pass through her body. She turned back to see Ivan looking at her. \"What happened?\" she asked again, her voice calmer. \"I see him break into gym,\" Ivan replied. \"I stop him and...we fight.\" \"Bare knuckle fighting? Is that what you do now?\" He frowned, \"I don't...\" \"Never mind,\" Jenny sighed, sitting down next to him. \"You should have just called us, or the police.\" \"He would have seen me if I go into office to use phone. I have no choice but to fight him.\" His words were calm, his tone measured and yet there was a look in his eyes, almost like a child, desperate for praise. \"You always have a choice,\" she replied. Gently, she lifted his hand and examined it. \"Does it hurt?\" \"A little. Nothing to before.\" \"He didn't hit you in the face then,\" she said, observing that not so much as a mark grazed his flawless skin. \"He did, but it take more than him.\" He looked down. \"I am sorry if you are angry. If you want me to leave...\" \"Don't be ridiculous. You don't have to be sorry and you certainly don't have to leave.\" She glanced over towards Dan again. \"I should be thanking you, for protecting our property and for making him suffer.\" Pausing, she sniffed the air. \"Is that gasoline?\" \"He throw it over things,\" Ivan said, \"I think he try to set fire.\" Jenny glanced over his head towards Dan again. \"Asshole...\" she got to her feet, \"You're a fucking asshole, Dan!\" He glared at her but said nothing as the officer began cuffing him. \"Too scared to do anything or say anything when the cops are around? Such a fucking coward that you have to beat your wife in private and break into our property in the middle of the fucking night?!\" Before she knew what had come over her, she was flying for him, fists raised, ready to beat the living shit out of him. But before she could reach him, before she could inflict the damage she wanted to, she felt arms go around her waist and pull her back as two officers stepped between them. \"Knock it off!\" One of them shouted at her, his hand hovering over his holster. \"We're taking him downtown to be processed for breaking and entering and attempted arson. If you want to join him on an attempted assault charge, then carry on. Otherwise...\" \"It's fine officer, \"Jim said, stepping in front of her. \"My daughter's just upset about what's happened here tonight. We all are. If you can just remove Mr Sullivan then that would be much appreciated.\" It was only seeing her father standing in front of her that made Jenny realise that he wasn't the one holding her back. Allowing herself to go limp, she turned and saw that it was Ivan's arms she was encircled in, his hands that were on her waist and she felt a sudden current jolt through her body. Almost as if he had felt it too, he let her go, stepping back as he did so. Her face flushed, Jenny turned back to where Dan was being led away, meeting his gaze as she did so. A realisation seemed to flash in his eyes, his gaze suddenly darting between her and Ivan. Before he could say anything, and before she could refute what she knew he had seized upon, he was gone. \"You should have let me hit him!\" she turned and snapped before she could stop herself. Ivan said nothing for a long moment, as though he was weighing up the meaning of her words and the reason for her sudden anger towards him. \"You would have been arrested.\" Anger began to build inside her like a volcano brewing and bubbling before it erupted. \"Maybe that wouldn't have been a bad thing! Maybe it would have been worth it for me to land a few on that son-of-a-bitch!\" \"No,\" he shook his head, \"it would not be worth it.\" The volcano erupted. \"Oh, because you would know, would you?! You know what it's like to have a husband who likes to hit you?! Who think it's all right because his Daddy used to hit his Mommy?! You know what it's like to have to cover yourself in make-up and hide the bruises?! To tell everyone that your marriage is perfect when you know that it's nothing but a living hell?!\" Her voice reverberated around the room, the few remaining cops and forensic team staring at her as though she had suddenly lost her mind. \"To lie there, night after night and let him fuck you because you're too afraid to tell him to stop?! Who are you to tell me that I shouldn't have just fucking killed him right now for everything that he's ever done to me?!\" \"Because I have killed!\" he snapped back. \"Because I have killed and it is...it is...\" he fought for the right words in English and found himself wanting. \"I don't want...you don't want to know...\" The fire and anger left her body as quickly as it had come and she suddenly felt depleted, as though she had, in fact, just gone fifteen rounds in the ring. Glancing at her father, she saw a look on his face that made her want to break down and cry and she realised that there were things in her marriage that he had probably suspected happened but hadn't really wanted to believe did. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, her voice calmer, more under control. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...I shouldn't have said anything... oh God...\" she caught sight of the clock on the wall. \"I should be getting ready for work.\" \"Jenny...\" Jim said, his voice shaking slightly, \"Maybe...\" \"I have to go to work,\" she interrupted him. \"It's the first day back and the kids will be expecting me and their graded papers. I should get going...\" she paused and turned back to where Ivan was still standing, his gaze uncertain. \"I'm sorry Ivan,\" she said. \"I shouldn't have said...I shouldn't have said what I did. You...you were right to stop me.\" Ivan watched as she hurried to the main door of the gym and slipped out into the dull morning light, the door banging behind her. For a moment, there was silence, no-one in the room knowing what to say. But, gradually, the forensic team continued their work and the cops began talking amongst themselves again. He stood, not quite knowing what to do, not sure of what his place was. \"Thank you,\" Jim said, \"for stopping her.\" \"It was...how you say...instinct?\" Ivan replied. \"Yeah, well...\" Jim sighed. \"Next time I'm face to face with him, I hope your instinct fails you.\"","LastChapter":"Hello folks! Once again, I'm so sorry for not updating for a long time. I'm now on maternity leave having had my wee boy 7 months ago and thought I would have lots of time to write. How wrong I was! I do want to finish this story (still a long way to go!) and I was watching some Dolph the other day and just got the mojo back. Hope you enjoy it and please review if you can! January 5 th 1986 Dan had thought about going to the house to confront her. After all, he was a direct man who preferred the one on one approach. Sneaking around in the dark wasn't usually his thing. But he also knew that Jim, although past his best, could still land a pretty mean right hook and that when it came to his daughter, he no doubt wouldn't hesitate to do so. Dan had known for years that Jim didn't like him, most likely from the first time he saw a bruise grace Jenny's face. Accidents. They had all been accidents, mistakes, transgressions that he had apologised to Jenny for and she had graciously accepted. But not this time. This time, after their fight at Christmas, she had walked away. Packed her bags and left. No-one did that to him, least of all her. His mother had never walked away from his father and he would be damned if his wife walked away from him. He balled his fists at his sides to stop himself from punching the wall. His last approach had been stupid. Coming to the gym tanked up on vodka...he had been an easy target for her to land a lucky punch of her own. He had been surprised but, in some ways, it had also been a massive turn on. If things had been different, if they hadn't been in the middle of the street, if they had been inside he knew, as sure as he knew anything, that that punch would have led to some incredible sex. Jenny was nothing if not predictable. This was his next best option. Hit her and her father where it would hurt. Their precious gym. Once a place where many an up and coming fighter would train, himself included, now a rundown ghost of its past. And yet, they loved that place, kept it going, flogging the dead horse. He didn't know why. What was the point in sentiment? Not when there were shiny new gyms in the city to take over. Slipping the crowbar out from under his jacket, he levered it against the lock until it easily cracked and the door sprang open. There was no sudden burst of wailing alarms, no security guard shouting at him. There was nothing except the wind. Pathetic, he thought, as he lifted the can and slipped inside. In reality, he was doing them a huge favour. XXXX By the time he got down into the courtyard, Dan had vanished and, for a moment, Ivan wondered if he had imagined the whole thing. Perhaps he was starting to hallucinate, seeing enemies everywhere he went. Then he heard a soft thud, as though a door had closed without catching properly and, turning, he saw the back entrance to the gym slightly ajar. Clenching and unclenching his fists, he moved towards the door, trying to stay as silent as possible. Although he hadn't seen a weapon, it didn't mean the other man might not be carrying one. Quietly, he pulled the door open and slipped inside, making sure that he closed it behind him, before making his way slowly down the corridor towards the main gym. Although it was dark, the moon was full, giving him enough light to be able to see where he was going. As he drew nearer, he heard a clattering sound, as though something had been dropped, and he caught sight of a figure in the far corner. Ducking behind one of the bags, Ivan watched as he began emptying liquid out of a can onto the door and walls, moving along and across towards the ring. An acrid smell filled the air, one that Ivan instantly recognised as gasoline. His purpose became all too clear and, without giving it further thought, Ivan stepped out from behind the bag. \"Ostanovis! Stop!\" Dan jumped and swung around to face him, the can falling from his hand and rolling across the floor. \"What the fuck...?\" He peered in the dim light. \"Who the fuck are you?\" \"You should leave,\" Ivan said. \"I don't know who you are, but this has nothing to do with you!\" Dan said, his hand going into his pocket. \"So if you know what's good for you...\" he paused and frowned. \"Wait a minute...I do know who you are.\" Ivan stepped forward again, hoping this might give him some form of advantage. \"Then you should leave.\" \"You're Ivan Drago!\" Dan exclaimed incredulously. \"Ivan Drago! In this fucking hellhole? The Siberian Express! Death From Above!\" he walked up to him and started laughing. \"Knocked out by a small Italian! Way to go, big guy! You know, I box. I mean, I'm not exactly heavyweight champion of the world but I reckon that even I could have beat Balboa...\" He stopped suddenly. \"But, what are you doing here? Are you working with Jim? Don't tell me you left Russia to come here and work with him? Fuck me, times must be hard! But then, I guess you're not exactly flavour of the year as far as the old Ruskis are concerned...\" Ivan knew he shouldn't have reacted. He had never reacted, not in the days since his defeat. When he had been browbeaten by Nikoli, Milla, everyone...he hadn't reacted. He had accepted the criticism, taken it as best he could and internalise the feelings. Now, faced with this...man...this man that he knew could hurt...someone...he felt himself lash out, a stinging blow catching Dan across the face and sending him sprawling backwards. Dan leapt quickly back to his feet, his hand to his mouth and Ivan felt himself tense into fighting stance. He had fought no-one since Balboa, hadn't even considered another fight, but as Dan rushed at him, he knew he had no choice. XXXX Jenny's first concern, when she ran into the gym, wasn't for the fixtures and fittings and it certainly wasn't for Dan. When the phone had shrilled through the house in the early morning, waking her from a dream the details of which she couldn't now remember, and her father had answered it, something inside her had just known that he was involved. Part of her, the dark part that she would never admit to, had half hoped it had been the police to say that he had died, but as Jim had relayed the story of a break in and a fight, she had realised that she would never be that lucky and found herself suddenly desperate to know if Ivan was safe. Through the throng of people that had gathered, police, emergency personnel and curious bystanders, she only sought one person and felt relief flood her when she caught sight of him sitting at the edge of the ring having his hand bandaged. \"Are you all right?\" she demanded, skidding to a stop beside him. \"What the hell happened?\" \"Looks like a cracked knuckle,\" the EMT answered before Ivan could speak. \"Ice and bandages for a few days and it should be fine.\" He gestured over his shoulder. \"Looks like he came off the worst.\" Jenny turned to where a battered and bloodied Dan was having steristrips attached to a cut on his forehead, a police officer flanking him. His expression was surly, his gaze fixed on Ivan. She had seen that look so many times during their life together and she felt an involuntary shiver pass through her body. She turned back to see Ivan looking at her. \"What happened?\" she asked again, her voice calmer. \"I see him break into gym,\" Ivan replied. \"I stop him and...we fight.\" \"Bare knuckle fighting? Is that what you do now?\" He frowned, \"I don't...\" \"Never mind,\" Jenny sighed, sitting down next to him. \"You should have just called us, or the police.\" \"He would have seen me if I go into office to use phone. I have no choice but to fight him.\" His words were calm, his tone measured and yet there was a look in his eyes, almost like a child, desperate for praise. \"You always have a choice,\" she replied. Gently, she lifted his hand and examined it. \"Does it hurt?\" \"A little. Nothing to before.\" \"He didn't hit you in the face then,\" she said, observing that not so much as a mark grazed his flawless skin. \"He did, but it take more than him.\" He looked down. \"I am sorry if you are angry. If you want me to leave...\" \"Don't be ridiculous. You don't have to be sorry and you certainly don't have to leave.\" She glanced over towards Dan again. \"I should be thanking you, for protecting our property and for making him suffer.\" Pausing, she sniffed the air. \"Is that gasoline?\" \"He throw it over things,\" Ivan said, \"I think he try to set fire.\" Jenny glanced over his head towards Dan again. \"Asshole...\" she got to her feet, \"You're a fucking asshole, Dan!\" He glared at her but said nothing as the officer began cuffing him. \"Too scared to do anything or say anything when the cops are around? Such a fucking coward that you have to beat your wife in private and break into our property in the middle of the fucking night?!\" Before she knew what had come over her, she was flying for him, fists raised, ready to beat the living shit out of him.

And, when he meets a young teenager, who asks a very important question, he will find just how much he learned from Rocky's previous example, and prove to the Soviet Union and all of Russia that he could rise from the ashes of his former fame and prove himself through the way of a true victor. I First Encounters Walking about the main streets of Russia's small town, Drago looked thoughtfully about him. He had been much more observant of his surroundings when he had been taken from his training, steroids no longer part of his daily routine. It was a relief, to finally get a chance at normality, to respect the boxer who had beaten him those few years ago. He noticed everything that passed him by, instead of carelessly brushing the everyday sounds out of his mind, concentrating on beefing up. Drago smiled, an extremely rare occurrence for the former vicious boxer. 'I now notice the days as they should be ('Я теперь уведомление дни как они должны быть'),' Ivan thought jubilantly to himself. Stowing his thickly-mittened hands farther into his coat pockets, Drago shivered slightly in the cold winter noon. The sun was just beginning to heat up the cobbled streets, though it had been up for hours. It peeked from behind a row of shops and houses clustered together in the little town. Squinting in the bright light, Ivan headed for the grocer's, hoping to buy another few rubles' worth of food. The little bell over the door tinkled madly as he opened it, denouncing his presence to the customers and employees inside. Wall to wall was stacked with everything a town could imagine. Newspapers, food, and other necessities. In one corner, there was a small meat counter, a gruff, bearded man stood behind it, stripping the remaining fat from a piece of venison. Turning to face a different corner of the store, he caught sight of what he had been searching for. A few rows of bread stacked neatly atop each other, still fresh, ready to be picked up and bought. Beside it were a variety of buns, pies, and pastries, shelved next to cans of pie crust and filling. Picking up one of the warm loaves, and clutching a package of tarts, Drago went to the front counter, which was right next to the door, to pay for his purchases. Digging out a few large coins from his pocket, he placed them on the wood counter; the employee scraped the coins off and calculated his change. Handing the remainder of his change back, the cashier returned to counting the money in the register. Exiting the store, Drago walked with less haste down the streets. His current errand done, he could enjoy the rest of the day. The loaf and package tucked firmly into the crook of his elbow, the former Russian boxer's eyes never missed a beat of what was going on around him. People were coming to and from stores, a few in thread-bare clothing peering out from whiskered eyebrows at passers-by, while they stood next to a small store-front. Ivan's boots still crunching against the snow-covered streets, he did not notice when he bumped into something. \"Hey! Watch where you are going!\" (\"Эй! Часы, где вы будете!\") she yelled, her eyes blazing anger. Drago finally got the chance to look down. It was a young teenager, probably around fifteen or sixteen. Her hair was the typical blonde, though close to golden brown in some places, and her eyes were iced-blue. She had a scarf wrapped around her, and a thick coat that seemed to keep out all the weather could dish out. It was no wonder he had accidently knocked into her, she was definitely a lot smaller, compared to his massive frame, and she was even smaller than most at her age. \"Sorry, I did not see you there,\" (\"Простите, я не вижу Вас,\") he answered back, clearly blown away by her harsh manner. \"Of course, how could you? Go on, make fun of my size! Everyone does!\" (\"Конечно, как вы могли? Продолжайте, смеяться над мои размеры! Каждый делает!\") she snapped back, obviously she had brushed the apology aside with a flick of her flaming eyes. \"Why? Since when did size matter in anything?\" (\"Почему? С каких это вопрос не размера, ни в чем?\") Drago asked, plainly curious. Before she even thought of answering, her eyes lit up and her jaw dropped in complete awe. \"You are Ivan Drago!\" (\"Вы, Иван Драго!\") Apparently, he had not changed a lot if it took so few words passed between the two to understand who he was. \"Yes, but I do not find that much of a badge of honour to wear, save that I was beaten by a worthy opponent,\" (\"Да, но я не считаю, что большая часть пропуска в честь носить, исключением того, что я был избит достойный оппонент,\") he shrugged dismissively, obviously still guilty about his past. Sitting down on a nearby bench, out of the way of street traffic, the two continued there conversation. \"You were everything that the Soviet Union was grasping for, but you proved them wrong! You proved that man cannot become machine!\" (\"Ты же все то, что Советский Союз, хватаются за но вы доказали, что они были неправы! Вы доказали, что мужчина не может стать машина!\") clearly, she had done a fair bit of research to figure all of this out. \"I proved that, and I learned some, but what does it matter?\" (\"Я доказал, что и я узнал кое-что, но то, что это важно?\") \"What does it matter?! What does it matter, you say?! You showed everyone out there, that you can't beat anyone with just muscle; without heart!\" (\"Что же это вопрос! Что это важно, говорите! Вы показали всем, тем, что нельзя бить никого без сердца!\") this girl seemed to have done a lot of time for research and careful study to figure all of this out and spout it at a stranger. Not liking where this conversation was centering around -boxing- he decided to change the subject to something more simplictic. \"What is your name? I believe you already know mine.\" (\"Как вас зовут? Я полагаю, Вы уже знаете моей.\") \"I am Roksana, but most call me Serafima Roksana,\" (\"Я огнем одного Рассвет, но большинство звоните мне Рассвет,\") she answered. \"Serafima is my pet name, because I am so passionate about arguing, and sometimes become hostile.\" (огнем одного Для меня домашнее животное имя, потому что я так увлекает утверждая, а иногда становились враждебными.\") Ivan Drago nodded, his expression showing that he was soaking in the information, comparing her pet name with her personality. \"By the way, are you ever going to box again, or was that just a one-time appearance?\" (\"Кстати, вы когда-нибудь будем опять квадрат, или, что всего один раз?\") Roksana looked up at the tall Russian, her face alight with curiousity. \"I- I do not know. I have not considered ever trying again,\" (\"Я - я не знаю. Я никогда не пытаются снова\",) Drago replied, taken aback by such a question, presented in the bluntest way possible. He could barely remember ever hearing himself speak like that, let alone hear someone else say it to him now. \"But... why? You would prove to the Soviet Union that people cannot be made into machines, that will and desire is stronger than any amount of brute force and strength. You could show them that you could do whatever you pleased, and win, without using their \"scientific methods\". You could learn to box again,\" (\"Но... зачем? Вы хотели доказать СССР, что люди не могут превращаться в машины, что воля и желание сильнее, чем любое количество грубой силы и прочности. Вы могли бы показать им, что вы можно делать все, что вам приятно, а победить, не используя их \"научными методами\". Можно научиться коробку\",) Roksana delved deep into the heart of the discussion, never faltering. \"I do not know. This is all just hopes and guesswork,\" (\"Я не знаю. Это всего лишь надежды и догадки,\") Drago pointed out, deflating Roksana's confidence a little. \"But... you could still show the Soviet Union that you never needed what they had to become a boxer. You just need a good trainer.\" (\"Но ... Вы могли бы показать еще Советский Союз, что вы никогда не нужно то, что он имел стать боксером. Вы Просто хорошие инструктора.\") \"Exactly. Without a trainer, none of this will even get off the ground.\" (\"Совершенно верно. Без инструктора, все это будет даже приступить.\") Drago was pessimistic about the whole thing, and he wasn't afraid to show it. 'Why did I even start this conversation?' (\"Почему я даже начать этот разговор?\") he thought miserably to himself. \"Anyways, I can see you are fairly busy, so I won't keep you. Perhaps I shall see you again, at the training center,\" (\"Немцы, я вижу, вы довольно занят, Иван Драго поэтому я не буду держать вас. Возможно, я буду видеть вас снова, в учебном центре\",) Roksana hinted as she stood up, ready to start on home. \"Perhaps,\" (\"Возможно,\") Ivan Drago replied, watching her leave. Maybe he could box again. But then, who knew if two Russians, one an over-imaginative teenager and a dismal former boxer could even make it. But... what if they could? 'Perhaps,' (\"Возможно,\") he said again, to himself. To be continued... o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o Fortunately, I do not own ROCKY, or any of the products and individuals enclosed in the movie, (if I did everything would be a complete blob of junk), so, that's my wordy disclaimer right there. Roksana means \"DAWN\", and Serafima means \"FIERY ONE\". Roksana Serafima in this case will mean \"fiery dawn\". Her pet name is not used very much, and you rarely will hear a last name, if at all. Ivan Drago is, of course, not one of my own characters, but don't be angry about how I turned about his attitude. The movie never conveyed his thoughts, only what he said, so such things cannot be fully determined, though you can be sure he has a good side, and guilt. Ruble is Russia's currency. The Russian wording is there because, after all, they do live in Russia, and that is basically what their speech would look like. As for the pronunciation, you'll have to ask someone who can easily dictate Russian, as I only used a beta translator. It is also there to put some individuality into the type of story I am writing, so that anyone who can read Russian or English will fully understand the conversation. Hopefully, you like my story, and you'll review it. I'm quite pleased to have the chance to add in my own Rocky fanfic, and get the whole subject better known to others. Zealak Silverdirk[Chapter 2] II Strength of Will and Mind Roksana turned back and looked almost demandingly at him, her eyes sending the silent message for him to come to the training ring. Before he could glance curiously back, she disappeared into an alleyway, a small one, made by two stores pressed unrealistically close together. It was a wonder she would even think of going through there, let alone fit, even for her small size. When she was gone from sight, Ivan Drago thoughtfully stroked his chin with an index finger, considering if he should actually pay this ambitious teenager the request and duty she had laid upon him. 'I shall think about it,' ('Я буду думать о ней,') he said to himself, brushing away the lingering thoughts and worries that she had dug up from his past. Standing up slowly, Drago finally decided to head off home, though for some reason, he didn't want to. He wanted to think about what he had just heard, take it all in, consider it, figure it out. Decide . Keeping to a fast pace, the tall Russian wanted to get home as soon as he could, to think about the matter in a better environment. Something about his home always helped him to think better. Maybe the familiarity of so many decisions made before. Fumbling with his gloved hands to find his keys, Ivan Drago stood on the front steps of his small house as he unlocked the door. His wife was not home, nor would she be for a few years to come. She was off with the Soviet Union, looking for more ways to program soldiers like machines. Apparently, Drago's attempt had started her appreciation and curiousity on the subject. 'Perhaps a better environment to make decisions in,' ('Возможно, улучшению условий для принятия решений в,') he thought. The last thing that he had agreed on had led to his daily use of steroids and intense training. Eventually the death of Apollo Creed, and his non-sanctioned fight in the ring with the champion, Rocky Balboa. Guilt shot through him as he remembered Apollo, barely moving on the floor of the ring, everyone crowding around him. And those words. Those words that he himself had spoken. Burning into him and everyone around. \"If he dies, he dies.\" Stabs of agony, digging into him cruelly. Setting down the bundle on the small kitchen table, Drago headed to the living room, where the small television and his favourite armchair were located. Sitting down into the cushion, he ignored the television. He wanted his thoughts clear and crisp, untainted by news and commercials advertising all manner of things. -- Slipping into the house with ease, Roksana silently closed the front door, locking it behind her. A pot was simmering on the stove, and the tea was ready. Placing her thick coat on the hook by the doorway, she entered the kitchen. With deft, practised ease, she snatched up the full kettle and tossed it lightly and carelessly into the air. Catching it as it came near the wooden floor, Roksana balanced it in one hand as she opened a cupboard and gathered a few mugs. Barely regarding the fact that she could spilled boiling water everywhere, including herself, Roksana poured the water into each mug, plopped in a teabag, along with a spoon, sugar and cream. Without calling her family that the drink was ready, she went on oblivious, watching that the pot perched on the stove would not boil over. Not long after, a middle-aged woman thumped in, wanting to indicate her presence to the irresponsible teenager watching the stove with indifference. \"And you could not call any of us down when our tea was ready? Do you think you are the only one in this house Roksana Sevana?\" (\"И вы не могли позвонить любому из нас, когда наш чай готов? Считаете ли вы, что вы - единственный человек в этом доме заре Севана?\") Sighing deeply and rolling her eyes, Roksana sipped her tea, paying no heed to the lecture her mother had carefully selected out from her long list. 'Yes, I know. Need to think more of others. Be more considerate, it's the only way you will ever get a husband, I know.' ('Да, я знаю. Нужна больше думать о других. Будьте более внимательны, это единственный способ вы станете мужем, я знаю.') When the kitchen fell silent again, Roksana figured it was either because her mother had asked her a question, or she was finally finished with her lecture. With no sign that she had even heard the lecture, Roksana pulled the pot from the stove, and drained the access water. Still ignoring her mother, who was bursting in silent outrage, the teenager spooned out vegetable soup into six bowls. \"Dinner!\" (\"Ужин!\") she screeched, grabbing a bowl and her mug and snatching the best place at table. A young boy of about six flew down the stairs, knocking something over in the process. \"I will fix that later!\" he called implusively up the stairs. Rushing to the kitchen, he stopped completely when he saw Roksana sitting in the favoured seat of the house, right next to the warm stove. \"Hey, why does she always get the best spot?\" (\"Эй, почему она всегда в лучших местах?\") he whined, like all six year olds did. \"Because, I actually have to do something to get the meal done,\" (\"Потому что я действительно что-то сделать, чтобы получить обед сделали,\") she sneered, watching her brother trying to grab a mug from the counter. Handing it down to him, Roksana's mother shook her head in defeat. Roksana had always been a born arguer, from the day she learned to talk she always had something to debate, it wasn't worth the bother. Soon, the rest of the family, including her father and two brothers were all seated at the table. Each dug into their regular meal of potatoes, soup, mixed vegetables and roast, smothered heavily in thick, rich gravy. Knives scraped against plates for about half the meal, until Roksana's father broke the proverbial ice. \"So, Roksana... What were you doing out today? Weren't you supposed to help your mother clean the house?\" (\"Значит, Roksana ... Чем вы занимались сегодня? Если бы не вы должны помочь вашей матери убирать дом?\") \"I already finished it. Anyways, I did not do anything really special today, except for one thing...\" (\"Я уже закончил его. В лубом случае, я не сделал что-нибыдь реально экстренный выпуск сегодня, за исключением одного вещи...\") Roksana paused dramatically, her eyes sweeping around the table to take in everyone's facial expression of interest. \"I met Ivan Drago today.\" (\"Я встретил Ивана Драго сегодня.\") There was a surprised silence. Her father raised his eye brows almost up to his depleting hairline, and her mother's eyes were wide with shock. But, of course, the eldest brother, Borya (his nickname for Boris), began to laugh outrageously. \"Of course you met him, dear sister...\" (\"Конечно Вы встретили его, дорогая сестра ...\") he could no longer finish his sentence he was laughing so hard. \"Right! We all know that he would never meet you unless he trampled you under his boots!\" (\"Право! мы знаем, что он никогда не встречал бы Вы, если он не растаптывал Вы под его ботинками!\") the second eldest, Danil, piped up. This caused even more laughter. \"Roksana, lying like that is not a good thing to do. If you did not have an exciting time out there, then at least be kind enough to tell the truth,\" (\"Рассвет, лежа как этот не хорошая вещь, чтобы сделать. Если Вы не имели захватывающего времени там, то по крайней мере быть достаточно любезным, чтобы говорить правду,\") her mother said softly. Roksana's eyes blazed. How dare they! Her argumentative, agressive nature was taking over her rationality. \"Fine! If you do not believe me, than I cannot force you to, but you will regret making fun of me!\" (\"Отлично!, Если Вы не верите мне, чем я не могу вынудить Вы к, но Вы будете сожалеть высмеять меня!\") Standing up in a flourish of anger, she didn't say a word, not trusting herself. Soon, she was grabbing her coat and slamming the door behind her; running. She had no idea what she was thinking, or even why she had had the sense to grab her coat. Going outside would just prolong another lecture about outbursts and lying, so why was she out here? Did she really think that Ivan Drago was going to take up her request? Maybe this was just some strange dream, and she would wake up knowing that she was just another boring Russian teenager, who was too outspoken for her own good. But... that wasn't possible. Just because it felt like a dream now, didn't mean it wasn't true. Right ? To be continued... -- Alright, a second chapter. Not as great as the first one, and extremely late in coming from what I had planned, but, not everything turns out the way you anticipate. The scene where Roksana fools around with the teapot was completely random, but I'd probably do the same thing if I had the chance. Ugh, I doubt this neglected chapter will measure up to the first one, I always have story issues like that, but I am determined to finish this story, if only for your sakes. Pardon that it took so long to update. Blame my parents for that. Zealak Silverdirk[Chapter 3] III You're Not Very Convincing Roksana sat moodily up in her old treehouse. There wasn't much one could call their own in in a Communist country, but the rotting crates and skids nailed haphazardly to the tree were, to say the least, better than any cathedral sanctuary to her. In the past, Roksana imagined that she really was the outcasted Quasimodo, shunned from the world, deaf, and practically insane from lack of human compassion. Not exactly something to share around the kitchen table. In any case, the hand-me-down treehouse, which had been neglected for years, had remained Roksana's favourite place to sulk. She could hardly blame her family for responding so unfavourably, but so what if you didn't meet a local ex-celebrity everyday? Life had been so boring it practically owed her. And anyway, there was no guarantee she would ever see Drago again. It would be difficult to take such a bizarre request seriously. She swore under her breath. \"You are an idiot, Roksana.\" (\"Ты идиот, Роксана.\") But she made up her mind to go past the training centre tomorrow, with the excuse of visiting a friend of hers who had taken up with the boxing craze. If Drago made an appearance she would be successful, and if he didn't at least she wouldn't look completely foolish. One problem solved. The skid she was sitting on creaked ominously. Roksana leaned into a crook in the tree, shifting a good deal of her weight. The treehouse's poor construction and upkeep had kept even her two younger brothers on the ground, but Roksana had a stubborn attachment to the thing. \"Serafima, where are you?!\" (\"Серафима, где ты?!\") Someone chanted in a sing-song. Borya had obviously been commissioned to look for her this time. If she were completely honest with herself, Roksana knew he would probably find her in a matter of minutes—it wasn't much of a secret that she still hung out in his old \"tree dump\"-but she didn't want to be found. Not when she was still smarting from her family's quips. \"Be a good little sister and stop worrying your big brother.\" (\"Будьте хорошим сестренку и перестать беспокоиться твой старший брат.\") His voice was getting closer. Borya was practically stomping through the wooded area, scattering leaves and cracking branches with his heavy boots. \"Stubborn mule,\" (\"Упрямый мул,\") he mumbled. \"I resent that,\" (\"Я возмущен, что,\") Roksana said finally. Borya stood directly below her, arms crossed with a pouty smile. \"What's going on little Serafima?\" (\"Что происходит немного Серафима?\") Roksana snorted. \"Think about it. For once in my life something interesting happens and my own family won't even believe me.\" (\"Подумай об этом. На этот раз в моей жизни происходит что-то интересное и моя собственная семья даже не поверил мне.\") \"Come on, you know you're not very convincing. You've always been the most dramatic of the family.\" (\"Ну, вы знаете, что вы не очень убедительно. Ты всегда был самым драматичным в семье.\") \"Well, that's just it! You think what you like without once considering whether I might be telling the bald-faced truth, Borya.\" (\"Ну, вот и оно! Вы думаете, что вам нравится, ни разу не рассматривает ли я мог бы говорить наглая правда, Боря.\") Borya kept looking from his sister to the tree, obviously trying to figure out how to get up there, or how to get her to come down. He sighed. \"So, what if you are telling the truth?\" (\"Так что, если вы говорите правду?\") Roksana leaned forward so fast the tree groaned in protest. \"I. Met. Ivan. Drago. Isn't that amazing? The Soviet's best boxer talked to me. Me!\" (\"Я. встретил. Ивана. Драго. Разве это не удивительно? Лучший боксер Советского разговаривал со мной. Меня!\") \"What'd he say to you?\" (\"Что он тебе сказал?\") \"I asked him if he would box again. He didn't exactly say yes, but he didn't say no either.\" (\"Я спросил его, если он снова коробку. Он точно не сказал, да, но он никогда не сказала нет либо\".) Roksana's eyes were bright with the prospect. Her brother was also a boxing enthusiast, but he liked to think that he was a rational and responsible man. He approached it from a more conservative perspective. \"That is really cool. But why would he listen to you?\" (\"Это действительно здорово. Но почему он тебя слушать?\") She deflated a little and leaned back again. \"I don't know. But... he looked like he really was thinking about it. Is it so wrong to get my hopes up?\" (\"Я не знаю. ... Но он, похоже, действительно думал об этом. Разве это так неправильно, чтобы получить мои надежды?\") Borya could only shrug. xxx \"Why?\" (\"Почему?\") A clock in the hallway chimed the hour. Ivan Drago stared unseeing out the window of his spartan kitchen. It might have been his dream to become a professional boxer, but it had so quickly become wrapped up in other things: the expectations of his wife, the prestige of the Soviet Union, the technology and tests, the constant striving to be the best. What did it even mean to be the best? In the end, all the training in the world could not have defeated the \"Italian Stallion\"-the little man strong as iron. \"Am I even capable of starting over?\" (\"Разве я способен даже начать сначала?\") he wondered. By the time he had learned that to fight well was to fight with your own power it was too late, and he—Drago, not the Soviet Union—had lost. It scared him to start over. At the worst times he was trapped within his own personal hell, reliving every single moment of Apollo Creed's death—no, murder!- with ghoulish clarity. Lights, cameras, action, screaming, crying, and then... the stillness of death. Not to say that death in the ring didn't happen, but Ivan knew so well that he had wanted to crush that snide Apollo, had wanted to prove himself to a cold audience - a cold Communism. And yet as soon as he left the ring he knew he had lost. \"Is there room for a coward to start over?\" (\"Есть ли место для труслив, чтобы начать все сначала?\") The kitchen was silent. xxx To be continued... The name of this chapter is a personal chastening. I said I would finish, and obviously I can't even convince myself. Oi. Anyways, I finally decided that the English was waaay too stiff, so I switched it to conversational. The Russian translation will still be formal, since I honestly have no idea how they deal with things like contractions and slang. But if you're curious about pronunciation, check it out in Google Translate, it seems to be helpful.[Chapter 4] \"Yet we don't give up on boxing, it isn't that easy\" Joyce Carol Oates, On Boxing IV Try Again \"Just come back to the house, Serafima. Don't mind what the rest of the family says. Hell, don't mind what I say.\"(\"Только что вернулся в дом, Серафима. Не возражаю, что остальные члены семьи говорит. Черт, не против, что я говорю\".) Borya sighed. \"If Drago meets you again like he said he will... it's just good to see you passionate about something even in this mess of a country.\" (\"Если Драго встречает вас снова, как он сказал, что ... это просто рад тебя видеть любите то даже в этом беспорядке страны.\") Roksana sniffed and swiped a hand under her nose. \"Now you're just trying to sound responsible, Mr. Boris.\" (\"Теперь вы просто пытаетесь казаться ответственный, Борис.\") Borya grinned. \"Aren't I, though?\" (\"Разве я, правда?\") His sister laughed and climbed tentatively back down to the ground. \"So, will you ever believe me?\" (\"Итак, вы когда-нибудь мне веришь?\") \"Get me a polaroid and I'll believe it.\" (\"Дайте мне Polaroid, и я верю в это.\") \"Nothing less for my favourite brother,\" (\"Не что иное для моего любимого брата,\") she chuckled. xxx Roksana watched only half interested as one boxer performed a poor combination of jabs. Klyde was easily one of the worst boxers in the place, but he was always there trying to improve. Roksana was grateful that he'd been forced to wear headgear. The trainers often told Klyde not to quit his day job. An alarming number of boxers were bulky and heavy, trying to desperately imitate the stereotypical body-builder frame of recent heavyweights. But there were still plenty of average looking young men around; either lanky and spry or compact and skilled.* Klyde was technically part of neither category, but he was definitely better than when he'd first discovered boxing. \"Take a rest, you two,\" (\"Отдохни, вы двое,\") the trainer called. Klyde leaned heavily on the ropes by Roksana. \"That guy is intense,\" (\"Этот парень интенсивным,\") he wheezed. Roksana was ruthless. \"Well, he's better than you.\" (\"Ну, он лучше, чем вы.\") \"Toss me a towel, would you? What's up, anyways? You've been here everyday for the past week. It was easier to show off once a week instead of every day.\" (\"Бросок мне полотенце, не так ли? В чем дело, так или иначе? Ты здесь каждый день в течение прошлой недели. Это было легче, чтобы показать один раз в неделю, а не каждый день.\") She smiled half-heartedly. \"You're right. I usually forget how bad you are by the end of the week. But I think you're better than last week.\" (\"Вы правы. Я обычно забывают, как плохо вы к концу недели. Но я думаю, что ты лучше, чем на прошлой неделе.\") Klyde scrubbed at his hair with the towel. \"That's the nicest thing you've said all day, Serafima.\" (\"Это хорошая вещь, которую вы сказали, в течение всего дня, Серафима\".) Roksana sighed. \"Truthfully I'd been hoping someone would show up by now.\" (\"Честно говоря, я надеялся, что кто-то был бы появиться в настоящее время.\") \"No way, I thought I'd finally caught you!\" (\"Нет, я не думал, что я, наконец, поймал тебя!\") \"That's gross, Kly. Stick to boxing.\" (\"Это валовые, Kly. Придерживайтесь боксе\".) \"So who's the guy?\" (\"Так кто же он?\") Roksana stared the ceiling. \"Well, he was almost professional. Quit when he was in a bad spot-\" (\"Ну, он был почти профессиональным бросить, когда он был в плохом месте -\") \"Waitwaitwait, how old is this guy?\" (\"Подождите, подождите, подождите, сколько лет этот парень?\") \"What's it to you, anyway? Pretty sure he's mid-twenties. Ridiculously tall.\" (\"Что это вам, так или иначе? Довольно уверен, что он середине двадцатых годов. Смешно высотой.\") A familiar voice sounded close by. \"I figured you'd be the only girl in this place. I hope you don't walk home by yourself.\" (\"Я полагал, что ты будешь единственной девушкой в этом месте. Я надеюсь, что вы не ходите дома самостоятельно.\") Klyde and Roksana shot toward the sound. Klyde gasped. \"You're really here,\" (\"Ты действительно здесь,\") couldn't help staring. Ivan Drago nodded timidly. \"It was a hard decision. Sorry for the wait.\" (\"Это было трудное решение. Извините за ожидание.\") Klyde was completely starstruck. \"Y-you mean, you... you were talking about him ? Ivan Drago? Death from Above?\" (\"Вы имеете в виду, вы ... вы говорите о нем? Иваном Драго? Смерть с Небес?\") Drago winced. \"Please don't use that title.\" (\"Пожалуйста, не используйте этот титул.\") \"So you'll really try again?\" (\"Таким образом, вы будете действительно попробовать еще раз?\") Roksana chewed her lip to relieve her tension. Klyde could only look back and forth between the two until his trainer called him back to practice. \"I'll try.\" (\"Я постараюсь\".) xxx To be continued... I updated a lot slower with this chapter because I wanted to do some research into boxing. I was mostly interested in the basic skills and the psychology of the sport, but I'd like to think I learned some useful things. If you get the chance, check out Joyce Carol Oates' book \" On Boxing .\" It was a surprisingly good read. Sorry that this chapter is so ridiculously short, but I really want to get something on the table, and this is really as far as this chapter needs to be. *Not to say that fast-moving boxers aren't skilled, but they have a distinct advantage with speed that lets them get away with sloppier punches. Slower boxers have to play their punches with more care because they won't have nearly as many chances to hit their opponent. Muhammad Ali in his prime vs. his older self is an excellent example.[Chapter 5] \"One gets so used to one's own horrors, one forgets how they must seem to other people.\" The Thirteenth Tale Chapter V Ghost Klyde called over his trainer, a ruthless middle-aged man known affectionately as 'Herod', and introduced Drago. Herod looked impassively between Klyde and Roksana, finally looking at the former heavyweight with scathing disinterest. \"He'll do as a middleweight*.\" (\"Он будет делать, как среднем.\") \"What? Are you sure?\" Roksana and Klyde coursed together. \"He was a heavyweight*.\" (\"Что? Вы уверены? Он был в супертяжелом.\") Herod curled his lip. \"My eyes see a middleweight. Even if he's the size of a light heavyweight*, he doesn't have the experience. Don't try telling me otherwise.\" At the training centre, Herod's word was better than the law. It was final and unflinching. \"If he's willing to fight, I'd pair him with Nikolas.\" (\"Мои глаза видят в среднем. Даже если он размер в полутяжелом весе, у него нет опыта. Не пытайтесь рассказывать мне об обратном. Если он готов бороться, я бы пару его с Николая.\") Roksana and Klyde exchanged uneasy glances. Drago nodded tentatively and went off to the locker room. If anyone cared to pay attention in the sweaty, loud atmosphere of the place they might have heard the former heavyweight mumbling to himself. If anyone was standing close enough, they have heard the words: \"it's okay, this isn't the same, it's different now, you're different,\" repeated in a rapid-fire way. (\"это нормально, это не то же самое, он отличается сейчас, вы разные.\") He repeated it while he was changing-even as an assistant helped oil him up, tape his knuckles, put on his gloves, headgear, and mouthguard. The safety of the toilet stalls called to him, and Drago's stomach nearly turned in sympathy. He should be able to do this, there was no reason not to try again. He avoided looking in the mirrors. He approached one of the rings, more confident than he felt. Herod watched him like a predator even as he stepped through the ropes to face Nikolas, a middleweight who was stocky in comparison to himself. \"He's gonna kill that guy,\" Klyde mumbled, wide-eyed. Roksana nodded. (\"Он собирается убить этого человека.\") Nikolas beamed up at Drago with a mouthguard nearly as yellow as his teeth. Drago's mouth twitched in something like a smile. Already he didn't like where this was going. But it was too late to turn back now. Just like last time people were counting on him. Herod went through the rules with some rather colourful additions of his own. Drago would have laughed if he was anywhere else, even at a funeral. He just wanted to get this over with. Nikolas attacked him with the vigour of a hungry rat, sending a combination of jabs to Drago's face and chest. Instinct took over before the giant had time to be surprised, and he feinted, landing a shot across the shorter man's jaw. Spittle and sweat flew, and Klyde tried to cover Roksana's head from the spray with a none-too-clean towel. Every other boxer was busy with their own training, but the participants in this match were in another world altogether. Herod watched, impassive as the gods while the two fought, only yelling when a rule was in danger of being broken. Through the whole thing Nikolas was adding his own jibes, and Drago became more upset. This was so much like Apollo's fight it was driving him mad. He lashed out desperately and sent Nikolas flying. Drago recoiled. Apollo leered before him, formerly playful eyes now turned up in a violent seizure. Above the crowd's roar he could hear Apollo's wife scream, drowning out the fight within himself. \"Are you alright?!\" (\"Ты в порядке?!\") Herod was inches from Drago's face, his cheeks nearly purple from yelling. Nikolas stood off to the side, looking more worried than hurt. Drago leaned against the ropes for support, his legs suddenly water. Klyde and Roksana were through the ropes in an instant with towels and water. Herod watched Drago while he calmed down; Nicolas chattered away, hoping to soothe the big man. \"It's a big deal I know, knocking a full-grown man to the ground, even a gnome like me. Sometimes it's a bigger surprise to you than it is to the guy kissin' the ground. It wears off quick.\" (\"Это большое дело я знаю, сбивая матерого человека к земле, даже гнома, как я. Иногда это больше для вас неожиданностью, чем для парня целуя землю. Он смягчается быстро.\") Drago could only nod. \"You're Ivan Drago, aren't you?\" (\"Вы Иван Драго, не так ли?\") Everyone looked at Herod. \"You looked familiar, but after seeing so many guys through here they all start to blend. But you're tall with a reach t'the moon. Nobody can forget that in a hurry, even after four years. And what happened with that boxer in the exhibition. Talk about a mismatch.\" (\"Вы мне знакомым, но, увидев так много людей через здесь они все начинают смешиваться. Но вы высокий с ударом на Луну. Никто не может забыть, что в спешке, даже после четырех лет. И то, что случилось с этим боксеромвыставка. Разговор о несоответствии.\") \"I need to go.\" (\"Мне нужно идти.\") Drago made a fast retreat to the locker room, and nobody had the heart to follow him. Nikolas gaped after him. \"Tha… that's Drago? I haven't thought about that guy for four years and after all this time I get to spar with him in the flesh? I need to sit down.\" (\"Это ... это Драго? Я не думал об этом парне в течение четырех лет, и после всего этого времени я получаю в парах с ним во плоти? Мне нужно сесть.\") xxx Roksana looked up when Klyde approached, but he shook his head. She sighed for the tenth time in just as many minutes. Drago had disappeared by the time they'd all recovered from the shock of his sparring match. Nobody could blame him. \"This is his first taste of fighting in four years. He'll either remember everything he loved about it and fight again, or he'll remember everything he hated about it and never fight. It's his own fight. Nothing to do with us.\" (\"Это не его первый вкус борьбы в течение четырех лет. Он будет либо запоминать все, что он любил об этом и драться, или он будет помнить все, что он ненавидел об этом и никогда не воевать. Это его собственное бой. Ничего общего с нами.\") She hadn't noticed Herod's approach, but everything he said assuaged her guilt. The old man didn't like women \"sticking their noses in blood sport\" but even he could respect a woman that showed up religiously to a dingy training centre. It was Herod's round-about kindness. \"Do you think he'll fight again?\" (\"Как вы думаете, он будет бороться снова?\") He chewed the ends of his untidy moustache. \"Much as I'd like it t'be, it's not for me to say. Death rarely happens in the ring, and even then it's always the ref's fault for taking advantage of the fight*, but that don't stop a boxer from blaming himself afterward.\" (\"Столько, сколько я хотел бы, чтобы это было, это не для меня, чтобы сказать. Смерть редко бывает в ринге, и даже тогда это всегда ошибка судьи, которые воспользовались борьбе, но это не мешает боксеру из обвиняя себя после.\") Klyde shot forward. \"What death? What d'you mean, Herod?\" (\"Какая смерть? Что вы имеете в виду, Ирод?\") The aging trainer shot Klyde a withering look. \"What death, indeed. If y'know anything about Ivan Drago you remember the exhibition.\" (\"Какая смерть, действительно. Если вы знаете что-нибудь о Иван Драго вы помните выставку.\") Klyde nodded. \"Yeah, the one where he lost to Rocky Balboa. Amazing fight! Wish I could've seen it in pers-\" (\"Да, тот, где он проиграл Рокки Бальбоа. Удивительный бой! Жаль, что я мог видеть его в человек-\") \"Not that one! The exhibition in America. With Apollo Creed. If y'ask me, whoever sanctioned that fight in the first place should've been the one t'get his head smashed in. There was no sense in the whole of it. A disgrace t'boxing.\" (\"Не то, чтобы один! Выставка в Америке. С Apollo Creed. Если вы спросите меня, кто санкционировал этот бой, в первую очередь должны были один, чтобы получить его голову разбили. Там не было никакого смысла в целом от него. позор для бокса.\") \"I'd forgotten,\" Roksana whispered. \"Herod, what've I done asking Drago to even come here? No wonder he looked so terrified.\" (\"Я забыл. Ирод, что я сделал с просьбой Драго даже пришел сюда? Неудивительно, что он выглядел так страшно.\") Herod sighed. \"He knew what he was coming back to, even if you didn't. It's always been up to him and him alone. It's the inner fight between himself and no one else.\" (\"Он знал, что он возвращается к, даже если вы этого не сделали. Она всегда была к нему и его в покое. Это внутренняя борьба между собой, и никто другой.\") 'I just hope the ghost from his past is the weaker fighter,' Roksana said to no one. ('Я просто надеюсь, что призрак из прошлого является слабым бойцом.') xxx Although the two did not live in the same area, Klyde stubbornly would not Roksana go home alone in the dark. \"So what d'you think?\" (\"Так что же вы думаете?\") Klyde scratched the bridge of his nose absently, upsetting a healing cut. \"Ivan Drago is an interesting guy, for sure. I get that he's scared.\" (\"Иван Драго интересный человек, это точно. Я понимаю, что он боится.\") Roksana nodded. \"He's holding back. I saw it, too. Why?\" (\"Он сдерживает. Я видел его тоже. Почему?\") \"Maybe that's the way he's always been.\" Klyde wiped the blood from his nose onto a ratty-looking scarf. \"You know, like how boxers have different personalities in and out of the ring?\" (\"Может быть, это то, как он был всегда. Вы знаете, как боксеры имеют разные личности в и из кольца?\") \"But even in the ring at the centre he was being….\" Roksana trailed off, unable to find the right words. (\"Но даже в кольце в центре, он в настоящее время.…\") Klyde took out a bandage and patted it gingerly into place over the cut. \"I get what you mean. Maybe he just needs to reorient himself to the whole thing. It's been... what, four years since he got KOed* by Rocky Balboa?\" (\"Я понимаю, что вы имеете в виду. Может быть, ему просто нужно переориентировать себя целиком. Это было ... что, за четыре года, так как он был нокаутирован Рокки Бальбоа?\") \"Wow, it really has been that long. Maybe you're right.\" (\"Ничего себе, это действительно было так давно. Может быть, вы правы.\") Klyde grinned. He didn't often score the winning point in a discussion. Not to say that he was stupid, but Klyde had a gift for not taking anything too personally, and was often more willing to compromise than to spill unnecessary blood outside the ring. Still, he left Roksana to walk the last few streets on her own when she insisted rather loudly. People had begun to turn toward the noise and make angry gestures. He turned back toward the training centre. Kylde lived closer to the centre than to Roksana's house (which was decidedly more rural), but he preferred the walk in the chilling autumn air. It was like a giant ice pack for his numerous scrapes and bruises. Klyde was awful at boxing, and he knew it. But he loved to box. He rarely won a match, but he always fought to the end. Boxing allowed him to release stress, feel whole. It drained him of everything, while giving him something that nothing else in life could compare to. Every time he boxed, he could see (and also feel, after a bad fight) exactly where he needed to improve, or exactly where he could take advantage of his opponent's weakness. Watching Drago fight... he seemed to know his every weakness, but when he had struck his opponent, the giant had flinched, even stumbled back. Like he was... afraid? Of what? Definitely not Nikolas. Himself? Somehow that seemed right. To be continued…. xxx *Just in case you're not familiar with the abbreviation, KO refers to a knock out, when an opponent is literally knocked down in the ring and unable to get up to finish the fight. On the other hand, a TKO, or technical knock out, is considered very boring to the crowd at a boxing match, but happens far more often. When an opponent earns enough points through punches in a match, even if the two finish every round, the one with more points at the end is considered the winner. *middleweight = 160lbs; light heavyweight = 175lbs; heavyweight = no limit *The referee's only real job within the ring is to stop two men from killing each other. Both fighters have been trained to continue fighting no matter what, and even when they're exhausted or seriously injured they'll keep trying to fight. A good referee will already know this and keep the men in the ring safe at the cost of a match. A bad referee will continue a match by taking advantage of the fighters, and this can result in serious injuries or the death of a fighter.[Chapter 6] \"Those who are dead are not dead, they're just living in my head...\" Coldplay, 42 Chapter VI It's In the Past During the entire walk to his empty house, Drago's fingernails gouged his palms. The pain distracted his mind from dropping the tears swimming in his eyes.* His stomach lurched with every shaky step and his lips trembled with the effort of staying in his own body. \"It wasn't real, that happened a long time ago, you're okay, you didn't hurt anyone.\" (\" Это был не настоящий , что произошлодавным-давно, вы в порядке, вы не повредит никому.\") Only he did hurt someone. And he was reliving it over and over. It was a senseless murder. He was a murderer! He leaned against a building for support; his entire body was shaking so hard he could no longer hold himself upright. His insides turned over at the sight of his bloodied hands-the pain shooting from the nail wounds in his palms the only thing keeping him in the present. And then Drago doubled over, emptying his stomach onto the empty street. By the time he'd recovered himself, what was left of the sun had disappeared. He stumbled to his darkened house and had just locked the door behind when a wail tore itself from his lips. He slumped to the floor as the tears escaped down his cheeks. Why had he ever thought that he could go back to boxing? His defeat was revenge. It was just! To go back in the ring and face another man as though he himself were still one was horribly perverse. It didn't matter if he was still physically capable of fighting; his ghosts were too heavy to bear! Drago sat upon the floor, his knees under his chin like the tiniest child, trying to empty his heart of shame. His chest heaved mightily with every sob-he had never cried so hard in his life-and he continued in this way for hours until he fell asleep. xxx \"Well, how about that. The Polish are getting the chance to choose their own poison.\" (\"Ну, как об этом.Польский получаете возможность выбрать свой собственный яд.\") \"What d'you mean, Da?\" little Stepan chimed over his math primer. Fathers were infinitely more interesting than subtraction. (\"Что вы имеете в виду, отец?\") Lev looked over the paper at his wife, who was shooting daggers at him from the hall. He winked. \"Well, Step, a group of people have been less than happy with the Soviet leadership, so they've been trying to make their own choices where they can. The USSR has finally given them an inch and will let them choose who they want to lead their state.\" (\"Ну, Степан, группа людей, были менее чем счастливы с советским руководством, так что они пытались сделать свой собственный выбор, где они могут.СССР, наконец, дал им на дюйм и позволит им выбрать, кого они хотят привести свое состояние.\") \"Why haven't they been happy?\" Everyone present could tell Stepan was just warming up. (\"Почему они не были счастливы?\") \"The people in charge of us haven't been doing a good job. Poland wants to be able to choose people they think will do a good job for them.\" (\"Люди, ответственные из нас не делал хорошую работу. Польша хочет, чтобы иметь возможность выбирать людей, по их мнению, будет делать хорошую работу для них.\") \"Why do people let them do a bad job, Da?\" (\"Почему люди пусть делают плохую работу, отец?\") Lev struggled for a moment with what to say. \"The USSR has been very bossy and mean, sometimes hurt people to scare them enough not to say anything anymore. If you can't tell anyone, no one can help.\" (\"СССР был очень властным и означает, иногда людям больно, чтобы напугать их достаточно, чтобы не сказать больше ничего. Если вы не можете сказать никому, никто не может помочь.\") \"Why are people so mean?\" (\"Почему люди так имею в виду?\") \"I don't know, Stepan.\" (\"Я не знаю Степана.\") \"Why don't you know?\" (\"Почему не знаешь?\") \"Ask your mother.\" (\"Спроси свою мать.\") \"Ma, why doesn't-\" (\"Мама, почему нет -\") \"Do your homework for a change, Stepan!\" (\"Сделайте свою домашнюю работу для изменения, Степан!\") Thoroughly cowed, the six year-old went back to slouching over his homework. He jumped for the door as the bell rang, scattering paper, pencil, and a pile of eraser droppings. Klyde stood on the porch, a fresh bandage covering the bridge of his nose. \"Roksana here?\" (\"Роксана здесь?\") Stepan's lip protuded. \"Uhhh... I think so.\" He turned to the stairs. \" Roksanaaaaa !\" (\"Э-э ... я так думаю. Роксане!\") Yana swooped in and covered her son's mouth. \"I think she's in the backyard. In her tree. Supper's in an hour if you'd like to stay.\" (\"Я думаю, что она находится в заднем дворе. В своем дереве. Ужин в час, если вы хотите, чтобы остаться.\") Klyde flashed his best parent-pleasing smile. \"That's alright. I have to get to the training centre today.\" (\"Это хорошо. Я должен добраться до учебного центра сегодня.\") He closed the door for them and power-walked to the fenceless yard. Sure enough, Roksana was perched on those rickety skids, swinging her legs like the whole contraption wasn't moments from falling apart. \"I wanted to make sure you were coming to see me practice today,\" Klyde remarked offhandedly, now leaning against the tree. (\"Я хотел, чтобы убедиться, что ты придешь ко мне практиковать сегодня.\") There was no answer for awhile. Then: \"he really has no reason to come back.\" (\"Он действительно не имеет никаких оснований, чтобы вернуться.\") \"Sure he does, Roksana, but that's up to him, not you.\" (\"Конечно, он делает, Роксане, но это до него, а не вы.\") Roksana scoffed. \"Well, that's just it. There's nothing anybody can do to get him back. I'm so selfish for wanting him to fight again.\" (\"Ну, это Там нет ничего кто-нибудь может сделать, чтобы получить его обратно, почему.. Я настолько эгоистичны для желающих его драться.\") Klyde looked up at her. \"Isn't everyone? We don't do things for other people just to be nice, y'know. That doesn't mean pushing Drago into it was a bad thing. This sounds insensitive, but, what happened in the past... it's in the past . Humans don't live in the past, and it's not good for them, him especially. This is about Drago growing as a person, not as a boxer. You can wish him all the best but he's still the one that decides his next move.\" (\"Разве это не все? Мы не делаем вещи для других людей только, чтобы быть приятно, вы знаете. Это не значит, нажав Драго в это плохо. Это звучит нечувствительны, но то, что произошло в прошлом ... это в прошлом. Люди не живут в прошлом, и это не хорошо для них, он в частности. Речь идет о Драго растет как личность, а не как боксер. Вы можете пожелать ему всего наилучшего, но он по-прежнему один что решает его следующий шаг.\") \"I know.\" (\"Я знаю.\") To be continued…. xxx *For the first year and a half of my university life, the only way I knew to cope with my depression was to wear sunglasses as much as possible and let my nails grow long so that I could distract myself from crying with the pain when I clenched my fists. It was an awful way to live, but I did what I thought was the only way until I worked up the courage to tell my parents and get professional help. So a little piece of my past is a part of Drago. [ In response to Tim's question (sorry, I have no idea how to reach you) I've never heard that there was a movie idea for Drago floating around. The only way they could possibly do it justice was if it wasn't produced or made in North America and if it implemented a lot of the history and political struggles of the Soviet Union. ][Chapter 7] \"Everyone knows I'm in over my head, over my head...\" The Fray, You Found Me Chapter VII My Love The days blurred together. Ivan spent much of his time wandering around the house; trying to sleep, looking out at the street, keeping the television on for company. He'd tried to take showers but the effort even to make it to the bathroom exhausted him. Mostly he just sat around, and when he became restless he'd get up and sit somewhere else. He wanted to go outside and do something, anything, but when he opened the door his feet wouldn't move. It had been going on like this for a long time - he'd stopped counting - when the front door opened. \"Ivan?! Where are you?\" It was Ludmilla. (\"Иван ?! Где ты?\") She found her husband sitting listless on the sofa, the television and lights turned off. Drago smiled weakly. \"What's happened to you? I've been calling non-stop and you never answered. Are you okay?\" (\"Что с тобой случилось? Я звонил нон-стоп, и вы никогда не отвечал. Ты в порядке?\") Ludmilla looked into his empty eyes. \"What's wrong, Ivan?\" (\"Что случилось, Иван?\") Drago's body collapsed in a sob, his fists clenched over his eyes as if to capture and tame his tears. Ludmilla put her arms around him and stayed with him even as the heavings intensified. They sat this way for what seemed an eternity, and then Drago settled into weak spasms. \"What's wrong?\" Ludmilla asked, barely whispering. (\"Что случилось?\") \"I killed him.\" (\"Я убил его.\") \"Who? What are you talking about, Ivan?\" She cupped his head in her hands; her thumbs brushing the tears from his cheeks. (\"Кто? Что вы говорите, Иван?\") \"I should've stopped the fight. I knew he was weaker but I just kept hitting him, and hitting him, and hitting him. And then I just watched him die right in front of me. What kind of fucked up creature does that?\" Drago's voice broke again. (\"Я должен остановил бой. Я знал, что он был слабее, но я просто продолжал бить его, и ударил его, и ударил его. А потом я просто наблюдала, как он умер прямо передо мной. Какой пиздец существо делает, что?\") Ludmilla's eyes were hard as polished stones. \"Apollo Creed's death was not your fault, Ivan. You were two grown men, two men trained to win at any cost. If the roles had been reversed, the outcome would have been the same. Apollo Creed was retired, old, and foolish. And the referee was a doddering idiot. It was his job to protect both of you, and he didn't. He is the criminal, not you. You must believe that, my love.\" (\"Смерть Аполлон Крида не ваша вина, Иван. Вы были двое взрослых мужчин, двое обученных, чтобы выиграть любой ценой. Если роли поменялись местами, результат был бы тот же. Аполлон Крид был отправлен в отставку, старый, и глупо . и судья был слабоумный идиот. это была его работа, чтобы защитить вас обоих, и он не сделал. он преступник, не вы. вы должны верить, что моя любовь.\") \"Then why do I feel so guilty?\" (\"Тогда почему я чувствую себя такой виноватой?\") \"Because you were powerless. Even a bear* freezes in fear before a bigger enemy. The Americans hated you, and you were alone. It was your job to act fearless, even if you were terrified. There was nothing you could have done to feel guiltless, no way you could have known.\" (\"Потому что вы были бессильны. Даже медведь замерзает в страхе перед большим врагом. Американцы ненавидят вас, и вы были не одни. Это была ваша работа, чтобы действовать бесстрашный, даже если вы были в ужасе. Там не было ничего, что вы могли бы сделать, чтобы чувствовать себя не без наказания, не так, как вы могли знать.\") Drago wiped a hand across his face. \"But, it's always right before my eyes. I can't think of anything else.\" (\"Но, это всегда прямо перед моими глазами. Я не могу думать ни о чем другом.\") \"We'll find someone who can help you, whatever therapy you need. And I'll stay with you until you can handle it.\" (\"Мы найдем кого-то, кто может помочь вам, все, что вам нужно терапия. И я останусь с тобой, пока ты не может справиться с этим.\") \"What about your job?\" (\"Что насчет твоей работы?\") Ludmilla smiled wryly. \"The Soviet Union can wait; you're right here and you need help.\" (\"Советский Союз может ждать, вы правы здесь, и вы нуждаетесь в помощи.\") \"Why am I so weak, Ludmilla?\" (\"Почему я так слаб, Людмила?\") \"Because you're human.\" (\"Потому что ты человек.\") xxxx The next few weeks were like careful steps - Ludmilla taking her husband to see a psychiatrist recommended specially from a connection in the Union, feeding him, sometimes helping him bathe and dress when he was suddenly overwhelmed - she was patient and kind, and Drago was reminded of the early days in his sports training, when his wife had encouraged instead of calculated. Oftentimes he felt very selfish, but Ludmilla remonstrated him gently even when he didn't mention what he was thinking. It was a long recovery, but he no longer felt alone. To be continued... xxxx I was originally planning on keeping Ludmilla entirely out of this story, but I rarely write female characters and that pisses me off. As much as I'm not a fan of her character, she's a part of Drago's life, and I'd like to imagine that she must have been a supportive person (sort of like Adrian, but not nearly as soft). Also, I knew it would be better to merely mention treatments in passing instead of going into detail, because everyone's grief and depression are different, and so too are the ways they seek and get help. Going into detail about Drago's therapy is the kind of emotional voyeurism I want to avoid. *Get it, 'cause Russia is often depicted as a bear. Ugh, I should stick to sarcasm.[Chapter 8] The recent addition to the Rocky chronicles, 'Creed', is an excellent story about stepping out from under the shadow of a legacy, and it certainly did just that. In 1998 we meet Adonis 'Donny' Johnson, a fighter who landed in juvie after bouncing around the foster and group home system. He's approached by the late Apollo Creed's wife, Marianne, who knows that Donny is Apollo's son through wedlock with another woman. She takes him into her Los Angeles home and raises him like a son, which comes with a lot of wealth and perks. Still, Donny fights, taking down appointments in illegal fights across the border. Unsatisfied with a quiet existence he forces his way into the boxing world, and becomes a student of Rocky Balboa. Any of you who haven't seen it should get out to your nearest theatre ASAP and see 'Creed'. It was a great movie, full of more heart and heat than I thought possible, and it brought everything full circle.

It's my first Pan's Labyrinth story so I apologize if any one is OOC Constructive criticism is welcomed but flames are not! Enjoy Regaining Memories Chapter One: The Birthday Surprise It was approximately five years after Princess Moanna had returned to her kingdom. Over those years she had slowly regained her memories of her old life. It was a funny feeling, recalling memories. Some were pleasant, like exploring the castle when she was little, playing with the fairies and listening to legends. Some of the memories were sad, fights, getting in trouble and most horrible of all was she remembered her deaths. The memories of both of her deaths had left her with many nightmares. She'd spent the nights sitting up afraid that if she closed he eyes that she would never wake up. The Faun had stayed with her those nights. The Faun, he had been in many memories of hers. He had been her teacher and her closest friend. He comforted her when she was sad or scared. What really annoyed Moanna was that she still couldn't remember why he was with her. From what she had learned about fauns was that they didn't like humans. And yet he was her tutor and friend. She wasn't sure if she didn't know the answer or if she just hadn't remembered it yet. She had asked the Faun why he was here but he never gave her a straight answer. She was hoping that she already had the memory and just needed to recall it. This was what she was trying to do at the moment. Lying on her bed, all the while searching her memories to see if she had gotten any new ones. She was supposed to be getting ready for her seventeenth birthday party. She had a dress lying on the bed next to her that she was supposed to be changing into as well. A knock on the door took Moanna out of her deep thoughts and she looked up to see her mother walk into the room. \"My child, are you not ready yet? The guests will be arriving any minute.\" Her mother the Queen walked over to the bed. \"I know you don't like these sorts of things but it's a formality that I'm afraid we all have to go through.\" Moanna smiled at her mothers worlds. Her mother knew her so well. She wasn't sure that she would be able to connect to her new mother as she was still morning for her old one who had died in childbirth. But then she as her memories came back to her she remembered how close she and her mother had been. So wanting to please her mother she sighed and got off her bed. \"I'm not a child, mother.\" Moanna said light heartedly as she went over to her dressing screen to change into her new dress. \"I know my dear.\" Her mother smiled softly. \"You're becoming a young women.\" Her face became a little more serious. \"The time is coming soon for you to marry.\" - At these words Moanna froze, her dress over her head. She knew that she would eventually have to be married but had put of thinking about it as something that wouldn't be happening for a long time. She quickly finished dressing and stepped out into the room. Her mother clasped her hands together sighing. \"Oh, my dear. You look beautiful. Now come along the guests will be here by now.\" Moanna fallowed her mother out of the room still thinking over what had been said about her impending marriage. She was soon distracted though by the crowd of people that were in the large ball room they had walked into. Despite being a princess for such a long time Moanna still didn't like the large crowds that came along with the job. She was just setting out to look for the Faun when she felt someone tap her on the shoulder. Turning around she saw her mother, another woman and a girl who looked her own age. \"My dear this is your aunt Lilliana and your cousin Bella. They have been away for the last few years as their kingdom has been troubled.\" \"But now everything is fine.\" Lilliana smiled. \"And we did so want to meet you Moanna. Didn't we Bella.\" \"Yes, it's a pleasure to finally meet you!\" Moanna looked at Bella. She was smiling and looked nice enough but there was something about her that Moanna just didn't trust. Trying to ignore that feeling she smiled and replied happily. \"It's nice to meet you too.\" \"Well we'll just leave you two girls to chat.\" Lillian said as she and the Queen walked off talking. Once they were gone Bella turned back to Moanna. - \"So, were you really up in the real world?\" Bella asked looking at Moanna with interest. \"I heard they're all barbarians up there. Is that true?\" \"Some were kind.\" Moanna said in a small voice thinking of her mother (Carmen) and her friend Mercedes. Bella looked very skeptical. Moanna wanted to avoid this line of conversation. \"Where are you from?\" \"My mother and father are the rulers of a kingdom a long way from here.\" Bella said smiling seaming to be happy talking about herself. \"We have a lovely castle you should come and visit sometimes. What do you do around here for entertainment?\" Startled by the sudden change in conversation it took Moanna a couple of seconds to reply. \"I have lessons and I play with the fairies and my friend the Faun.\" Bella wrinkled her nose. \"You spend time with a faun ?\" She looked rather disgusted. Moanna looked at Bella angrily. \"What do you mean by that?\" ' \"I mean dear, he's a faun. Not a person, you shouldn't be spending time with him.\" Moanna was outraged. \"He's my best friend!\" \"But look at him.\" Bella protested, pointing across the room to where the Faun was standing. \"He's hideous.\" Moanna looked over and noticed he was looking at them but he quickly walked away. She looked back at Bella, wanting very much to hit her. \"The Faun happens to be my closest friend. So you had best not insult him in front of me again.\" \"All right.\" Bella rolled her eyes and her tone was one of someone humoring a small child. Moanna looked for an escape route then noticed her father. \"Will you excuse me Bella? I have to go ask my father something.\" \"Why of course dear and a happy birthday. I'm sure we're going to be good friends.\" - Highly doubting this Moanna walked over where her father was standing. She wanted to go over to see where the Faun had gone off to but to prove that she wasn't a liar she had to go speak with her father. Her father was talking to some lord that Moanna had forgotten the name of. \"Hello Princess Moanna.\" The lord said looking at Moanna. \"I hope you are you having a happy birthday.\" \"I am thank you.\" Moanna replied politely. Her father smiled at her. \"I'm so glad my dear.\" \"Father have you seen where the Faun went? I can't seem to find him.\" \"I'm sure he's around here somewhere Moanna. But before you go looking for him there are some people I'd like you to meet.\" - Some people turned into quite a lot of people and soon the party was over and Moanna still hadn't gotten away. She was with her parents saying goodbye to the guest's when Lilliana and Bella came over. \"Well we're off my brother. I hope you had a wonderful birthday Moanna. Maybe we'll come and visit you another time.\" Soon they were the last people there. Moanna looked around. \"Mother, father did you see where the Faun went?\" \"I'm sure he's around here somewhere my dear. But first we want to tell you something very important. Sort of a birthday surprise.\" \"Really mother, what?\" \"You're going to be a big sister. Isn't that wonderful?\" To say that Moanna was surprised was an understatement. She was shocked and not just a little worried. The last time someone she knew was pregnant they died in child birth. Not knowing what to say she ran out of the room leaving two very confused parents behind. ---------------------------------------- I hope you liked the first chapter of my story. Remember review please![Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own Pan's Labyrinth. A/N- First of all, sorry about how long it took to get this out, I had major writers block. Second, thank you to all the people who reviewed the first chapter! You guys rule! Third, this is the first time I have the Faun in the story so I hope I kept him in character. Fourth and last of all read review and enjoy….. Chapter Two: Emotions and Bella Moanna ran out of the ball room. She didn't care how immature she was being. She didn't care that the dress she was wearing wasn't really meant for running in. All she cared about was getting as far away from her parents as possible. How could they do this to her? She couldn't stand it if she lost another mother. It just wasn't fair! She had stopped running now and was walking through the woods outside the palace. She walked over to a tree and sat down under it. She sighed as she buried her head in her knees, wishing that the day had never happened. An intense type of sadness overwhelmed her as she sat on the grass. She wasn't paying attention to anything but her own misery. This was why she didn't hear someone approach her until they cleared their throat. The noise startled Moanna and brought her out of her daze. She looked up to see the Faun standing over her. He looked worried. She gave him a small smile when she looked up but knew that it wasn't going to fool him. The Faun sighed as he knelt down next to Moanna. \"What happened?\" Moanna didn't answer for a moment staring ahead. After a minute the Faun was just about to say something when Moanna spoke up. \"My mother's pregnant.\" Moanna said this in a perfect monotone voice continuing to stare ahead. The only thing that indicated any emotion was the slight quivering at the end of her words. At her words the slightly puzzled look on the Fauns face disappeared. He understood why she was acting like this. \"Moanna.\" The Faun spoke up gently. \"Just because your mother is pregnant doesn't mean she is going to die.\" Moanna looked at him sadly. \"That's what they said about my ….other… mother when she got pregnant and she died.\" Moanna buried her face in her hands trying to hide the tears that were there. Her mother's funeral had been one of the worst days of her life. \"I can't lose another mother. I…just…can't!\" Moanna lost the inner battle she was having with herself not to cry. \"Moanna.\" The Faun said again. \"You have to understand that things are different down here. Very rarely has anything bad happened to someone who was pregnant here. You do not have to worry about it. Your mother is in the royal family so there is even less you have to worry about.\" \"You think?\" Moanna said whipping her eyes. \"You're not just saying that to make me feel better?\" The Faun gave her a small smile. \"No, it is the truth.\" Trying to lift his princesses mood he asked. \"And how has your birthday been?\" Moanna knew he was trying to get her to think of something else and she appreciated it. \"It was fine. Except for my cousin.\" Moanna's face wrinkled as she thought of Bella. \"I suppose you mean Bella.\" The Faun said chuckling a bit. \"Yes I was of the opinion that the two of you would not get along.\" \"That's an understatement.\" Moanna muttered. \"But aside from that it was a nice day.\" She failed to mention what her mother had said about her getting married because she was trying to repress that memory. - \"Well I have something for your birthday too.\" \"Really!\" Moanna said with the expression of someone who believes that they've outgrown acting excited about presents but still want to. \"Why yes, here you are.\" He handed her a small package and watched closely as Moanna opened it. It was a small wooden box with designs carved on it. Moanna examined them, fascinated as she had never seen such designs before. The top of the box was hinged on one side and Moanna slowly opened it. Inside, the box was empty but the moment she had opened it the box started to play a soft tune. When she recognized the tune Moanna gasped and almost dropped the box in shock. It was the lullaby that Mercedes has hummed to her when she still lived on earth. Moanna looked over with tears in her eyes at the Faun who was looking a little uncertain. She placed the box over on the ground very carefully then hugged him fiercely. \"Thank you.\" She whispered. They sat there for a while. Moanna in the Fauns arms just like when she was little. oOoOo After a while the Faun brought Moanna back up to the castle. They were met by the King and Queen who were waiting at the door. When they reached the door the Faun bowed then left Moanna with her parents. He was glad that Moanna had liked his gift. He'd been worried that she might think it depressing, reminding her of her past life on earth. He wanted nothing more then for her to be happy. He sometimes wondered when the most important thing in his life had become her happiness. Or at the very least he would like to know why he always wanted to know what she thought about him. He had heard her at the party defending him. Knowing that she did defend him against someone her own age meant a lot to him, but why? He walked into the forest. He had a lot to think about. oOoOo Moanna had just finished explaining to her parents that she had not tried to run away but had just needed some time to think. After getting a lecture about scaring them, (they were after all parents first) Moanna was allowed to go to her room. Inside her room she lay on her bed listening to her music box. The music comforted her as she slowly drifted to sleep. --------------oOoOo--------------- It was about a month after Moanna's birthday and she was going over a lesson with the Faun. She had finally convinced him to teach the language of the fairies. For some reason he didn't want to teach her. He said that the fairies were quite annoying at times and she was lucky she didn't understand them. However after a while he gave in and agreed. That's what she was doing when her mother came into the room. \"Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt but I need to borrow the princess.\" \"Yes, your highness.\" The Faun bowed his head and watched as Moanna rolled her eyes and followed her mother out of the room. -- \"Yes mother?\" Moanna said as they came out of the room. \"What did you want to tell me?\" \"Well my dear. I have some good news. Your cousin Bella is coming to visit for a while. I'm sure the two will have a wonderful time together.\" Her mother was smiling thinking her daughter would be happy at this news. Moanna sighed her mother might know her well but she seemed oblivious when it came to Bella. Moanna had only met her for a few minutes but from that experience she didn't want to see her cousin again. She didn't want to say anything mean though so she replied. \"When will she be here?\" \"She'll be here later on today. You should go and get ready.\" \"Mother, I'm in the middle of a lesson!\" Her mother laughed good heartedly. \"You know my dear, you are one of the few teenagers I know that willingly want lessons. Let me see…. \"The queen looked over her daughter. \"You look presentable enough to see your cousin. Very well you may return to your lesson and I'll call you when your cousin is here.\" \"Thank you mother.\" Moanna replied giving her mother a small curtsy. That sent her mother off chuckling. Once she was gone Moanna clenched her fists to stop herself from screaming, composed herself and walked back into the room. The Faun looked up from the book he had been reading giving her an odd look. Moanna was used to this though as he had been giving her odd looks for the past month. She had somewhat gotten used to them. \"My cousins coming to visit.\" Moanna said breaking the silence of the room. \"Bella?\" \"Yes. But mother said that we can still continue the lesson until she gets here.\" \"Very well. Now come over here and repeat after me.\" oOoOo The lesson was interrupted after another hour by the arrival of Bella. A servant arrived at the room to get Moanna. The Faun said that he had to go do something which made Moanna jealous that he didn't have to meet Bella. Once they reached the front of the castle Moanna saw Bella surrounded by bags. The sight of the bags annoyed her more then seeing Bella because that meant that Bella would most likely be staying for a long time. \"Oh hello Moanna dear, it's so wonderful to see you! I was just so happy that I was able to come and visit again so soon. You simply must show me around the castle!\" \"Oh yes dear.\" the queen spoke up. \"Take Bella on a tour of the castle and the grounds. I don't think she's seen it all before.\" \"Yes mother.\" oOoOo The tour actually went better then Moanna had thought it would. That would be because Bella talked the entire time and she just had to point out whatever point at the castle they were at. However once they were outside in the grounds the topic turned to what seemed to be Bella's favorite topic. Marriage. Or at least bragging about how many suitors she had. \"Well there's Prince Hanison and Prince Marthelm and Lord Bartholomew….or was it Lord Bartholow?.. I can never keep them all straight.\" Bella laughed. \"What about you Moanna, how many suitors do you have?\" \"None.\" Moanna replied seriously. \"I do not want to marry for a long time, if ever.\" \"Not marry? Oh you silly girl! That's part of being a princess and one of the more amusing parts. My dear you will not believe the amusement you can get watching men competing for your hand. I find it quite entertaining. But don't worry I'm sure you'll have lots of suitors soon. Then you can spend time with them instead of that horrible Faun of yours.\" Moanna turned to face Bella. \"I told you not to insult my friend.\" She said through gritted teeth. \"Yes, yes I know, I know. I just worry about you sometimes. You shouldn't spend so much time with him.\" Moanna was still trying to stop herself from slapping that infuriating smile of Bella's face. \"We should go back inside so you can unpack.\" \"Very well Moanna dear. Lead the way!\" oOoOo They made their way back into the castle and into the room Bella was staying in. It was right next to Moanna's room which was good and bad. It was bad because, well because it meant that Bella was far to close to Moanna's liking. It was good because it meant Moanna could go and get a book with fairy language pronunciation from her room and was practicing while Bella unpacked her many suitcases. \"Moanna what on earth are you muttering over there?' Bella asked as hung up dresses. \"I'm practicing a language I'm learning. It's the language of the fairies.\" Moanna said while flipping through the book. \"How quaint! But really come and help me pick a dress out for tonight wont you?\" So Moanna rolled her eyes and went over to help Bella. This really just entailed listening to Bella talk about all the places she had worn certain dresses. It was clear that Bella had a very high opinion of herself. oOoOo After several excruciatingly boring hours of listening to Bella talk it was time to go down for diner. At dinner there was a strange young man there as well. He introduced himself as Prince Stephan. He seemed to be trying to engage Moanna in conversation a lot. Moanna thought he seemed almost as full of himself as Bella, but not quite. No one was that vain. He was nice looking but as far as Moanna was concerned she would be quite happy to see the end of him when dinner was over. - After dinner however she was talking to her mother and Bella outside in the garden. \"…and what did you think of Prince Stephan my dear?\" Her mother asked. \"He's okay…I guess…-- \"Oh I think he's gorgeous and so brave!\" Bella gushed. \"Did you hear his stories? Moanna you better be careful I don't steal him away.\" She laughed her high pitched fake laugh. Moanna was confused. \"Steal him away from me? He isn't mine.\" Something in her mind clicked just as her mother answered. \"My dear he's one of your suitors!\" So Moanna spent the rest of the night feeling miserable. Someone else had overheard the conversation and left to be alone in their misery as well. Well they were mostly alone, the fairies had an annoying habit of following the Faun whenever he was sad as they tried to cheer him up. Tonight however nothing they did helped. So both Moanna and the Faun spent that night feeling miserable for the same reason. Though neither one knew it…yet. ----------------- Yah, long chapter. And I have introduced a suitor! I hope you liked Bella's suitor's names I made most of them up them up on the spot if you hadn't guessed. I hope you liked the chapter and remember...Please Review![Chapter 3] Disclaimer- I don't own Pan's Labyrinth and I am not making any money from it….wouldn't that be cool though! A/N- Sorry aga in for the wait. School and work…what can I say. (Please don't kill me is probably a good start!). Remember to read and review! Chapter Three: Misunderstandings The next morning Moanna was sitting in her room. She was supposed to be going down for breakfast. She didn't want to though; she knew that her suitor and her cousin Bella would be downstairs. It had been a week and the two of them seemed in no hurry to leave. She was also trying to remember a strange dream she had the night before. Dreams were sometimes her old memories making themselves known to her. The problem was that until she remembered all of it her dream might simply be a dream. Her thoughts were cut short as Bella came walking into the room. \"Oh Moanna are you not coming down for breakfast? Prince Stephan is there waiting for you. Please walk down with me.\" Moanna sighed. \"Yes Bella, I'm coming.\" She got up and followed Bella down to the dining hall. Bella talked all the way down about Prince Stephan. Moanna didn't mind as she was starting to perfect the art of tuning Bella out. At breakfast she learned to extend this new talent to Stephan. He seemed to enjoy talking about anything as long as he was the one in control of the conversation. At breakfast Moanna looked over Stephan closely. She felt she was right with her original observations. He was good looking, bold, and charismatic and Moanna found him of no interest to her. Truth be told she wasn't sure what she was looking for when it came to love. She had always thought of it as something that would happen to her later, when she was older. She sat through breakfast thinking this over. What did she look for in a man? Someone who was intelligent she thought as she overheard Stephan say something about history she knew was untrue. Someone who was kind and most importantly someone she would be happy with. But from Bella's stories about her own suitors it seemed to Moanna that most of the eligible men seemed to be mostly the same as Stephan. - - - - After breakfast she attempted to break away form everyone else. To her dismay Prince Stephan caught up with her. \"Princess Moanna. Where are you going? I thought it was agreed that we would be going for a walk through the gardens on this fine morning?\" So that's what's she'd agreed to when she'd zoned out and was nodding her head all through breakfast. She attempted to look guilty but was just desperately trying not to laugh at how distressed he looked. \"I'm sorry but I have to go and met with the Faun. It's time for my lessons.\" Moanna turned away, not before seeing the look of utter amazement on his face. It was clear that he had probably never been turned down before. She only got about a foot away though before her mother had caught up with her. She had Stephan with her. \"My dear why don't you go for a walk with Stephan? It's a wonderful day out. You could go down by the lake.\" \"Mother, I told the Faun I would meet him after breakfast.\" \"But my dear Prince Stephan is our guest.\" Moanna noted the tone her mother was using, It was one that said that she wasn't about to be said no to. \"You can meet up with the Faun after your walk. I'll go tell him that you can't make it.\" Moanna sighed. \"Very well mother.\" She turned to the much happier looking Stephan. She thought he looked a little smug as well. She watched her mother walk off wishing she could go with her. oOoOo The Queen was walking up the staircase when she met Bella. \"Oh, hello your majesty.\" Bella smiled. \"Where are you off to?\" \"Hello Bella. I'm just going to tell the Faun that Moanna will not be able to go to her lesson this morning. She's going for a walk with Prince Stephan.\" \"Oh how lovely!\" Bella clapped her hands. With a falsely cheerful look on her face. The Queen didn't seem to notice though. \"Yes it is. I think that he and my dear Moanna will be very happy together. It's so wonderful. I'm sure he will make her very happy. My husband will be so pleased. I am going to talk to him after I see the Faun.\" \"I know, why don't you go tell the King right now. I can deliver your message to the Faun. The Queen smiled thinking how kind her niece was. \"Very well, please tell him that Moanna will not be able to come see him till later. He'll be in the third room to the left.\" With that she went back down the stairs to look for her husband. Bella watched the Queen go and smiled to herself. Then once she was sure the Queen was out of sight she went up the stairs and turned right and went to her room. oOoOo The Faun was waiting in the classroom for Moanna. They were continuing to work on the language of the fairies. He didn't know why Moanna insisted on learning fairy. They got rather annoying as they talked quite a bit. In fairness though they were very fond of him. They lived in his forest and helped him protect it. He looked around the room wondering what was keeping Moanna. She had said that she was going to meet him there after she'd had breakfast. He knew that it took them longer to eat breakfast when they had guests but surely they would be finished by now. He went to the door to look down the hallway. Moanna wasn't anywhere in sight. She was rarely late for a lesson and he was starting to worry about her. He decided to check for her outside. -- The gardens were empty as the King and Queen were busy holding meetings. When he turned around to go back to the castle he was annoyed to find that Bella had walked into the garden. Knowing fully well what she thought of him he expected to be ignored and so was surprised when she started to talk to him. He did catch the slightly repulsed look she tried to hide with a fake smile though. \"They're such a cute couple, aren't they?\" Bella smiled pointing at two people down at the lake. The Faun looked at her suspiciously. \"Who are you talking about?\" Bella's smile seemed to get bigger with his remark. \"Why Prince Stephan and Moanna of course. Look at them, they're the perfect match. I mean she was talking about how much she likes him just this morning. I'm sure that they'll be getting married.\" She was going to go on but as the sound of laughter drifted up from the lake she turned to find that the Faun had started to walk away. She smiled evilly, everything was falling in place. - oOoOo Down at the lake Moanna was wondering if Stephan ever ran out of pointless things to talk about. To his credit he did notice she was getting bored after a while. The slightly glazed over look on her face might have been a hint. So he was currently trying to get Moanna to talk about herself. This would normally be a nice thing do to but it wasn't earning Stephan any points. All it was doing was giving Moanna a chance to find out that as well as self absorbed he was a male chauvinist. \"So my dear Moanna. If you don't sew what do you do to take up your time?\" \"I read.\" Moanna replied picking up a rock from the shore. \"I have lessons, I go outside. Lot's of things.\" When she found the right rock shape she threw it out on the lake and watched it skip as she listened to Stephan. \"It's more lady like to sew you know. You should meet my sister, she loves to sew. I'm sure she could teach you.\" \"I didn't say I couldn't sew.\" Moanna replied irritably throwing a rock. \"I just prefer to do other things.\" \"..Well what are you learning now?\" Stephan asked quickly. \"The language of the fairies.\" \"Um…can you speak it?\" \"A little …\" Moanna looked over at Stephan suspiciously; he seemed to be trying to make up for his insult on her sewing skills. She could use this to her advantage. \"Can you speak it?\" \"Um, no actually I can not.\" He seemed a little reluctant to admit there was something he couldn't do. \"There are no fairies in my kingdom. I doubt that I will ever need to know. Can you say something for me?\" Moanna smirked. \"Very well, in fairy you would be called ….. lodaunta\" \"I assume that means Prince.\" Stephan said puffing out his chest. \"I shall have to remember that one. Moanna restrained from laughing. In truth lodaunta was the fairy equivalent of idiot. Not that Stephan would ever know that. \"I know.\" Stephan exclaimed suddenly. \"Why don't you call me that as a nickname.\" He seemed very pleased with the idea. Moanna took one look at his face turned around and burst out laughing. \"What's so funny?\" Stephen looked perplexed. \"Moanna, will you let me in on the joke?\" \"….never….mind…\" Moanna said as she calmed herself. \"It doesn't matter….\" she trailed off. For a second she had thought she had seen the Faun up in the castle gardens. It must have been a trick of the light or something as the garden appeared to be empty. oOoOo The Faun walked out of the garden before Moanna saw him. He didn't wish her to think he was spying on her. That Bella...he had seen the look on her face. She knew how he felt about Moanna. She had been showing him that deliberately. He wasn't surprised; many people did not like fauns. It was not the first time and would definitely not be the last time that someone would treat him poorly. What he was surprised about was what he'd seen. Moanna was walking…laughing with the Prince. He supposed he should have expected that, she was going to be married soon. She would leave with her husband and he would never see her again. He had just recently admitted to himself that his feelings for her ran deeper then friendship. It didn't matter though, she would be married to a Prince and the way things were going it might even be this….Prince Stephan. The Faun realized that he had never hated anyone as much as Stephan. He wondered what Moanna thought of the Prince. They looked to be getting along well. She had even missed a lesson to walk with him and Moanna never missed a lesson. The Faun wasn't mad at her though, all his anger was directed at the Prince. - He blinked out of his daze and discovered he had walked all the way to the forest. Sighing deeply he looked back at the castle. He didn't know when Moanna was going to be back. He didn't want to have to be a friend and listen to her talk about the Prince. That would do nothing to help his breaking heart. And it was breaking as he went deeper into the forest, wishing that Moanna didn't have to be married….at least not to a prince. oOoOo It was shortly after noon when Moanna had managed to pry herself away from Stephan. To her dismay Bella quickly pulled her over to talk to her. Moanna was quite certain that she was going to be talked to death. \"Oh Moanna, I'm sure the two of you will be so happy together!\" Bella gushed. That brought Moanna back into the real world. \"What are you talking about Bella? I never said that I was going to marry him.\" \"Why of course not. It's too early for that yet. You like him though, I can tell. You'll be a beautiful bride. Of course I'll be at your wedding. I'm sure it's going to be wonderful. Just as wonderful as your Prince.\" Moanna just stared as Bella rambled on. Did everyone think that she was getting married to Stephan? More importantly, did Stephan think they were getting married? She hoped not. She really did not want to get married to him. After an hour or so of listening to Bella talk, Moanna finally got away. Her mother walked by the door and she made an excuse to go after her. \"Mother, wait please!\" Moanna called out as she came running down the hall. Her mother turned to face her. Moanna what have I told you about running in the castle?\" \"Sorry mother.\" \"That's all right my dear, now what was it that you wanted?\" \"…..\" She should have thought of a question before she ran out of the room…. \"How is the baby?\" Her mother laughed. Patting herself where there was a small but visible budge. \"You're as bad as your father. I wouldn't be surprised if one day he decides to look me in my room until I give birth. I'm only three months pregnant you know.\" \"Yes mother.\" Moanna smiled. She was getting better about not pestering her mother about her health as she had done the first month she had known about the baby. \"Good. Now, I'm sure you're of to meet with the Faun so I'll let you go. Ask Bella where he might be. I got her to tell him you were going to come later.\" With that the Queen walked away. Moanna went back to the room she had so recently escaped from. \"Bella, did the Faun tell you if he was going to meet me somewhere?\" Bella looked up from the bed. \"Oh I'm sorry dear. He said he couldn't see you for a while. I think he had things to do.\" Moanna looked at Bella oddly she didn't think the Faun talked like that. \"He said that?\" \"Well I'm just re-wording it but that's the general idea.\" \"Oh….\" \"Now dear why don't you have some fun with me this afternoon? If that silly faun is too busy that's his loss.\" And so Moanna added an afternoon of boredom to her morning. She was quite happy when they had supper and she slipped away to be by herself. She wished she could talk to the Faun but she didn't know where he was. oOoOo Late that night Bella snuck out of her room. She glanced at the door to Moanna's room but she could hear her sleeping so it was quite safe. She went into an empty room on the far side of the castle. She sat there tapping her fingers, waiting. Just then the door opened and Prince Stephan walked into the room. \"Finally.\" Bella said irritably. \"Would you care to explain yourself?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking about your utter failure to get Moanna to like you…even the smallest bit! You're hopeless, she's more interested in that faun of hers then she is of you!\" Stephan looked insulted. \"I have no idea what you're talking about. I happen to think I'm making very good progress.\" Bella just rolled her eyes. \"Well you know the plan for tomorrow don't you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good, were sticking to that one. Try not to mess this up.\" Bella walked out of the room and snuck back to her room. Tomorrow, she thought, tomorrow that idiot Prince might actually make some progress. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Well I hope you liked the chapter. As you can see a plot is actually forming.

Chapter Four: In Dreams ------- ------- ------ ------ ----- She was running through the tall grass towards a forest. It had always been close to the castle but she had never been in it before. Her parents always said that dangerous things lived there but she was six and things like that just made her want to explore it even more. - It was dark, so dark. She looked around and only saw tree's surrounding her. She didn't know where she was and the noise was scaring her. She tripped on a root sticking out of the ground and scrapped her knees and her hands. - She was crying now , curled up under a tree. She was cold, tired and scared. She heard something strange in the darkness, it was something coming closer….she whimpered and tightened herself into a ball. - She heard a voice above her ask if she was lost. It wasn't a scary voice though so she looked up--- \" Moanna wake up now!!\" Moanna bolt upright out of bed. She looked wildly around and saw Bella standing in front of her. \"What did you do that for Bella?\" Moanna said catching her breath. Bella ignored her. \"Don't tell me you forgot what day it is.\" She didn't wait for Moanna to respond. \"It's race day!\" Moanna blinked, she had forgotten. Great….just great. Today there were race's being held at the lake and the royal family would be making an appearance. It wasn't anything important but they showed up every year to watch it and it grew into a tradition. \"So, I was thinking you could wear this dress.\" Bella was saying. \"I'm sure Stephan will love it. Oh the two of you are so adorable together.\" Moanna tuned her out as she sat on her bed. That dream, it was so familiar. She was sure she had been recalling a memory. If only her cousin hadn't woken her up. Who had been talking to her in the forest? She just wanted to back to sleep to find out but she sighed and got up. \"Yes Bella, I am getting up and as soon as you leave the room I'll get dressed.\" \"Good.\" Bella smirked as she walked out of the room. \"Now do hurry. We're to be down by the lake in an hour.\" oOoOo Bella walked down to the lake watching the people set up. She walked over behind the bleachers. After a few minutes she came back with a satisfied smile on her face. -- -- -- -- Moanna was waiting with her parent's in front of the lake. Her father was making a speech for the opening of the race. It was boring but since they were standing in front of the large crowd she did get a chance to look for the Faun. She didn't expect to see him though as he didn't like crowds. Once the race's started they made their way to the bleachers for the nobles. As royalty they sat the very top of the bleachers. Stephan had found her at that time and was talking to her non-stop. Moanna was glad when they reached their seats that she had an excuse to stop listening to him. The people racing in this race were rowers and they proved to be much better entertainment then Stephan. Soon the crowd's became exited and the bleachers were shaking. Moanna didn't notice until the end of the bench she was sitting on gave way. She started to fall to the side and screamed. \"Moanna!\" Her mother yelled as she saw her daughter fall. Just fast enough Stephan reached out and grabbed Moanna by the arm. He pulled her back onto the bleacher. He then helped her down onto the ground. Her mother followed them down. \"Moanna are you okay?\" Her mother was distraught. The bleachers were high up and a fall like the one Moanna almost had would have done considerable harm. If she hadn't had her neck broken on impact. \"Please tell me you're okay.\" \"I'm….fine.\" Moanna replied still a little shaky. \"I…think.\" \"Oh, thank you Stephan, thank you.\" The Queen was in tears. \"Your majesty.\" Stephan said looking around at the staring crowds. \"I think we should maybe go back up to the castle.\" The Queen looked around and noticed the people. \"Very well. Please accompany us to the castle.\" They made their way up from the lake. Moanna was visibly shaken and was hanging onto Stephan's arm. A slight part of her was thinking on how embarrassing she looked but she really wasn't thinking anything coherent. She was staring straight ahead and so she didn't notice someone was watching them on the way into the castle. oOoOo The Faun had seen what had happened at the lake. He'd nearly felt his heart stop when Moanna fell. When she was saved though he allowed himself to breathe again. He would have died if anything had happened to her. As he watched Moanna, the Queen and Stephan make their way up to the castle he noticed that Moanna was hanging onto Stephan's arm. He tried not to care but he couldn't help it. It looked like Moanna really did like Stephan. He turned around bitterly as he didn't want to see anymore. oOoOo Inside the castle the Queen insisted that Moanna rest. She and the Stephan were taking Moanna up to her room when they bumped into Bella standing outside the door. \"Oh, Moanna. I just heard what happened! Are you all right? You were so lucky Prince Stephan was there!\" The Queen looked fondly at Stephan. \"Yes, I'm very glad that she had you there Stephan. I don't even want to think of what might have happened.\" She shuddered at the thought. \"I was doing what anyone would have done.\" Stephan said with false modesty. \"But I am glad that I was able to save such a…beautiful young women.\" He lifted Moanna's hand and gave it a kiss. \"But now you must rest, my dear.\" Moanna only nodded amazed by the display in front of her. She realized that if she did go into her room to rest then she wouldn't have to spend the time with either Bella or Stephan. \"Very well…and thank you…for saving me Stephan.\" She said a little awkwardly. \"It was my pleasure Moanna.\" Moanna went into her room and lay down on her bed. It was only twelve and already her day had gone from normal to out of control. That fall had scared her a lot more then she let on. She didn't need to rest though, what she wanted was someone to talk to, to share her fears with. More than anything she wanted to talk to the Faun. She needed to talk to him. Her life was becoming one tangled mess. She took out her frustration by punching a pillow. She didn't want to marry Stephan just because she was expected to marry a prince. He was boring, cared nothing about her and was generally an idiot. Not at all like the Faun. Moanna suddenly went stiff. Where had that thought come from? No, no she hadn't thought that… couldn't have….but did she? Just then the door opened quietly. It was Bella holding a cup of tea. \"You're mother thought you might want something to help you sleep.\" She passed the cup to Moanna who was looking at her suspiciously. \"I think you and Stephan will be very happy together.\" Moanna looked up from the tea she was staring at. \"I don't think we will be.\" She said quietly. \"I will not marry him.\" She sipped her tea, missing the outraged look on Bella's face. \"Oh, well I'm sure you're just a bit rattled by the fall. Of course you're going to marry Stephan.\" With that Bella walked out of the room, leaving Moanna behind to wonder why Bella seemed so set on seeing her married to Stephan. - -- -- - After finishing her tea Moanna started to drift to sleep. - -- -- - She was curled in a ball under the tree when a voice asked her if she was lost. She looked up to see a funny looking creature gazing down at her. \" My dear are you lost?\" It repeated. She nodded wiping her eyes. The creature's voice was kind sounding and even though he was strange looking she seemed to know she could trust him. \" Well come with me my dear and I'm sure we can find out where you came from. But fir st we must clean off those scratches.\" He helped her up of the ground and she held tightly onto his hand as they began to walk. \" What is your name child?\" He asked looking down at her as they walked. \" Moanna.\" \" I see, now Moanna how did you come to my woods?\" \" I was exploring…and then I got lost.\" Moanna bit back tears. \"I didn't know they were your woods…I'm sorry.\" \" That's quite all right. I happen to share these woods with many creatures. You can see one right now, look.\" They had reached a stream and Moanna looked to where he was pointing. She gasped. \"What is it?\" There was a small creature flying in front of her. It looked like a little person with wings. \" This is a fairy. There are many that live in my forest.\" Moanna watched the fairy as it flew off back into the woods. \"Now come over here my dear and wash those scrapes.\" He had produced a piece of cloth from somewhere and proceeded to clean the dirt off of Moanna's hands and knees. Moanna leaned against him feeling safer then she had been in a while. \" What's your name?\" She asked looking up at him. He paused for a moment before replying. \" I have been called many things but I am simply a Faun and that is what you may call me.\" Moanna nodded solemnly. She may only have been six but she was smart for her age and knew that names were important. Once the Faun was finished washing off her scratches he turned to Moanna. \"Now Moanna. Do you remember where you entered the forest?\" Moanna thought . \"It was by my house.\" \" Well what can you tell me about your house?\" \" It's a castle.\" The Faun looked down at her oddly then smiled. \"Well then I'm positive I know where that is.\" He held out his hand and Moanna smiled and grabbed it. - They reached the end of the forest and Moanna's face light up as she saw the castle. \"I'm home!\" She exclaimed then hugged the Faun. \"Thank-you!\" The Faun stiffened at first but awkwardly patted her head. \" It was nothing.\" \" Stand back from the princess!\" A voice yelled out from nearby. Moanna looked up to see the head of the guards standing with her parents. \" Oh Moanna!\" Her mother cried. \"I thought we'd never see you again.\" \" You there.\" The King yelled at the Faun. \"Unhand my daughter at once!\" \" You heard your King.\" The guard said coming closer with his sword drawn. \"Let her go.\" - Moanna was confused by everything. Why were they yelling at her friend? \" Leave him alone!\" Moanna yelled clinging closer to the Faun. \"He helped me when I got lost. He's my friend!\" There was a silence and the head of the guard looked to the King for instruction. The King motioned for him to put away his weapon and he did, though slowly with his eyes never leaving the Faun. The King and Queen approached Moanna and the Faun. \" I fear we might have acted a little rashly.\" The Queen said smiling. \"Please accept our apologies and our greatest thanks for returning our daughter to us.\" The Faun bowed his head. \"It was my pleasure your majesty and do not worry. I am well aware that parents are always very cautious when it comes to their children.\" Happy that they weren't being mean to the Faun. Moanna ran over and hugged her mother. \"I got lost Mommy!\" \" I know my dear.\" She turned to her husband. \"We really do need to find her a tutor to keep her out of trouble.\" The Faun had been listening took that moment to speak up. \"If you are in need of a tutor I would be happy to offer my services.\" There was another moment of silence. While the King and Queen looked at each other. Fauns were very wise creatures but having one volunteer to teach a human was unheard of. They looked down at Moanna who was putting on her best begging look. \" Very well.\" The King replied then turned to his daughter. \"Now, Moanna I expect you to behave for your new tutor, is that clear? No running off exploring by yourself like you did today.\" Moanna bowed her head in \"Yes father.\" \" That's my girl. Now why don't you go show your tutor around the castle.\" Moanna grinned and grabbed the Fauns hand. \"Come on, I can show you my room and the kitchen and the--\" Her words were cut off as they went around the corner. - -- -- - Later that night Moanna was listening to the Faun tell her a story. When he finished he got up. \"Where are you going?\" Moanna asked. \" I am returning to my home.\" \" Are you coming back?\" Moanna asked frantically. The Faun chuckled. \"Yes, I'll be back tomorrow.\" Moanna jumped of the bench. \"And the day after that, and they day after that? \" Yes. Those as well. I'll be here as long as you want be to be.\" \" Good.\" Moanna proclaimed. \"I'll always want you to be here.\" She hugged him. \"You're my best friend!\" - -- -- - -- -- - -- -- - Moanna woke up normally form this sleep. She checked the clock in her room, it was three twenty. She had slept away most of the day…. but that dream. She finally remembered how she had met the Faun. She still wasn't sure what she was going to do about the whole Stephan mess but the dream did her remind her of one thing. The Faun was her best friend, even now that she was older. He always would be her friend. She knew he would take her side when she told her parents she didn't want to marry Stephan. She wondered why her mother would think they'd make a good match. True he was handsome but she really didn't care for him at all. She'd rather marry the Faun. Now that would be much better then marrying Stephan….she stopped, realizing her thoughts were again going into forbidden territory. What was going on with her? She was thinking about her best friend…in a definitely non friendship way. She moaned pushing her face into her pillow realizing that she had just given herself something else to worry about. oOoOo Bella was waiting for Stephan in the gardens outside. She sat on a bench fuming, she was mad and someone was going to pay. And that someone had just walked into the garden. Stephan walked over to Bella. \"Well that went well.\" He said cheerily. \"I'm sure Moanna must have fallen for me by now.\" \"Guess again.\" Bella snarled. \"She told me that she wouldn't marry you.\" Stephan gaped at her. \"Why not, I mean…I saved her life!\" Bella rolled her eyes. \"Well good job but she still doesn't like you. We have to work faster.\" \"What's the rush anyway? I mean we don't have a deadline you know.\" \"Yes we do, you idiot.\" Bella smacked him on the arm. \"You must have noticed that, that disgusting faun is in love with her. It's pitifully obvious but Moanna doesn't seem to notice.\" \"So you mean—\" \"Yes if Moanna realizes that her faun's in love with her then all our plans are for nothing.\" \"I find that quite insulting.\" Stephan humphed. \"I think she's insane if she would want an ugly faun when she could have someone like me.\" He flexed his muscles while Bella sighed. \"Yes, very nice now lets get to the plan. Putting her in danger worked once. One more time shouldn't seem too suspicious. So at five tonight I want you to---\" oOoOo It was around four fifty when the Faun was walking into the palace gardens. He didn't know why he was there. Well in a way he did. He wanted to see Moanna but wasn't sure if he actually had the confidence. He didn't want to hear her tell him she was in love with Stephan. Just as he was thinking that, Stephan ran into the garden almost knocking him over. \"Hey watch where you're going buddy!\" Stephan was going to keep going but then he realized who he'd bumped into. \"You!\" \"Yes?\" The Faun asked warily. \"Stay away from my future wife.\" The Faun blinked. \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" \"I said stay away from Moanna. Everyone knows you're in love with her so just leave her alone. She's going to marry me and there's nothing you can do about it.\" Stephan sneered and angry at not getting a response went on. \"Did you think that anyone as beautiful as Moanna would love a thing like you? You're hideous and I'm handsome, do the math.\" A thought struck Stephan and he smiled evilly. \"She even has a pet name for me. She calls me…..lodaunta!\" With that parting he left the Faun sanding there in silence. Lodaunta ….that was fairy for idiot. Why would Moanna call Stephan an idiot? Hope filled him, did that mean that Moanna wasn't in love with Stephan? The hope died quickly though, even if Moanna didn't love Stephan, what Stephan said was true. Moanna would never love something like him. It would never happen…..his thoughts were cut off as he heard screams coming from the castle. He ran to there appearing in a sitting room just in time to see the Queen faint. He looked to see what had happened and saw Moanna unconscious on the ground, blood on her forehead. - - - - - - - Cliff hanger! But aside from that I hope you liked it. Remember be kind and review![Chapter 5] Disclaimer- Again I must say that I do not own Pan's Labyrinth…I don't even own a copy of the movie. Woe is me…... A/N- First of all, thanks to the people who reviewed! Your review's make sure I keep writing quickly. Ugh, I hate thinking up chapter names! I finally have a general outline for the rest of the story! Remember to read and review! Enjoy….. Chapter Five: Many Conversations The room was buzzing with peoples voices. The King rushed over to his daughter then to his wife when she fainted. Two of the Queen's friends went over to her and using the smelling salts they always carried with them, helped her come to. Someone else had gone to fetch the royal physician. The Faun by that time was over by Moanna. He checked her pulse, she was only unconscious. He breathed a sigh of relief, he had thought for one horrible moment she was dead. \"What happened here?\" The Faun looked up to see the physician. He was a middle aged man called Dr. Blightly. He was one of the few people that actually showed the Faun any respect. \"I believe that a vase fell on her head.\" The Faun said solemnly. \"I wasn't here when it happened though.\" He watched as Dr. Blightly examined Moanna's head. \"Well it doesn't seem to be too bad.\" He took out his bag, whipped the blood off Moanna and started to wrap a bandage around the cut on her forehead. \"The cut's not very deep. The vase must have only scratched her. No the only thing that we might have to worry about is a concussion. Now help me carry her to her room will you.\" Bella who had just walked into the room stopped and stared. She then glared at Stephan who was standing embarrassedly in a corner. \"Why don't you get Prince Stephan to help you carry Moanna up.\" Bella suggested with her best innocent look on. \"Instead of the faun.\" Dr. Blightly looked over at Bella sternly. \"Princess Bella, I have looked after people in this castle for over 60 years and if I say that I want the Fauns help carrying Moanna upstairs then that's exactly what I want.\" Bella was taken aback by the mans reply. She was not used to people talking to her like that. Before she could reply angrily though the Faun had carefully picked up Moanna and he and Dr. Blightly walked out of the room. oOoOo In Moanna's room the Faun laid her gently on the bed. He was going to ask Dr. Blightly something when the King and Queen came rushing in. \"Oh, my poor daughter!\" The Queen was crying. \"Please tell me she is all right.\" \"Calm your self my dear.\" The King said patting her on the shoulder. \"Remember the baby. I'm sure she's fine.\" But he too looked nervously at Dr. Blightly. \"How is she?\" Bella exclaimed as she and Stephan came into the room. \"Well as I said before.\" Dr. Blightly spoke up. \"She should be fine. I'm going to have to check on her when she wakes up though. Now someone should stay with her.\" \"I will.\" The Queen said. \"Your majesty. You've just had a shock. You should be resting.\" \"I'll stay with her.\" Stephan said after being elbowed by Bella. He tried to look devastated. \"I want to be there for her…now that she's in pain.\" The Queen smiled at Stephan while the Faun looked irritated. Dr. Blightly noticed both looks. \"Actually young man, you were there when the vase fell. I'd like to talk to you about what happened. You might be able to give me some insight on how hard she was hit. So come with me won't you?\" He turned towards the Queen. \"Also you, your majesty need rest.\" The Queen sighed \"Very well. But tell me the moment she wakes up.\" She and the King left the room. Bella and Stephan sill stood in the room. \"I think Stephan should stay with Moanna.\" Bella said with her arms folded. \"No, no. I need to ask him a few questions.\" Dr. Blightly voice was firm and he took Stephan's arm and led him to the door. Bella followed, very angry. \"Now, Faun when she wakes up come and get me. She should be waking up in an hour or two.\" The Faun nodded and sat down in a chair by Moanna's bed. Dr. Blightly shooed Bella and Stephan out the door. He looked back and saw the Faun looking down at Moanna and he smiled and quietly closed the door. oOoOo Once Dr. Blightly had finished asking Stephan questions he left Bella and Stephan alone in the room. \"What happened?\" Bella exclaimed when they were alone. \"You were supposed to SAVE HER! Not stand there like an idiot!\" \"I tried! All right, you just did it too early. I didn't get there in time!\" Bella looked around them. \"Be quiet, someone might hear us!\" She sighed shaking her head. \"Very well we have to make due with what we have. You will be attentive to her because she is hurt. Most importantly we can't let that faun alone with her for too long. Okay?\" \"Yes, I know. I know.\" \"Good, do this right and you might actually be able to be King one day.\" - A figure walked away from the door just before Bella and Stephan came out. \"What was that?\" Bella asked looking around. \"What?\" \"I thought I saw something...never mind.\" They both walked off. oOoOo Moanna blinked, everything was blurry and her head was pounding. There was also something on her head. Her eyes started to clear and she was able to see her surroundings. She was lying on her bed, she looked up and saw the Faun looking down at her. \"How are you feeling?\" The Faun asked her quietly. \"My head hurts.\" Moanna admitted. \"But aside from that I feel fine.\" She touched the bandage on her head. \"What happened?\" \"It appears that you were hit on the by a vase. Your head is bandaged as you can see.\" Moanna's grimaced as her head sent another bolt of pain. The Faun got up. \"I'm supposed to go get Dr. Blightly now that you're awake.\" He stopped at the door and said a little awkwardly. \"I'm glad you're all right...Moanna.\" Then left quickly. Moanna stared at the door and shook her head. She remembered standing in the room but nothing after that. She supposed she was lucky that she hadn't lost her memory. That would have been horrible as she was just getting it back in the first place. She realized with a jolt that she still hadn't gotten a chance to tell the Faun that she remembered when they first met. He'd even been alone in the room with her. Though to her defense he did leave fairly quickly. - She waited for about twenty minutes before the Faun returned with Dr. Blightly. She heard them talking for about five minutes before they came into the room. She couldn't hear what they were saying though and didn't want to be caught eavesdropping. So she just waited for them to come in. \"Hello Moanna.\" Dr. Blightly smiled. \"How are you feeling?\" He got out his doctor's bag and started to pull things out. \"Fine. It's just my head that hurts.\" \"No wonder. You got quite a hit on the head. You're not nauseas are you?\" \"No.\" \"Any dizziness, blurred vision?\" \"No.\" \"That's good.\" Dr. Blightly finished what he was doing and poured some medicine onto a spoon. \"Just take this then.\" Moanna took the spoon and quickly swallowed the liquid. Dr. Blightly had been looking after her when she was sick for as long as she could remember and most of the medicine he gave her tasted horrible. This one was no different. Moanna wrinkled her face. \"Ugh, why does it always have to taste...so bad?\" \"That's how you know it's working. Now Moanna, you're going to have to take it easy for about a week or so. Tell me if you start getting dizzy or nauseous.\" \"I will.\" \"Good, now I'm off to tell your mother the good news.\" He saw Moanna's expression. \"Don't worry, you need rest. I tell her she can come and see you after.\" Moanna smiled, her mother meant well but whenever something bad happened to Moanna she tended to become rather over protective. - Once Dr. Blightly had packed up and was leaving the room Moanna looked at the Faun who was standing by the door. He looked like he was starting to leave so Moanna spoke up. \"Will you stay with me for a while?\" He looked at her and gave her a small smile. \"Of course.\" Dr. Blightly chuckled as he left the room earning him a glare from the Faun. - The Faun went over and sat on the chair next to Moanna's bed. There was an awkward silence. Moanna hadn't seen the Faun in two days but it felt much longer thanks to everything that had happened. Moanna remembered something and spoke up. \"I remembered you know.\" The Faun looked at her puzzled. \"What did you remember?\" \"How I met you.\" The Faun said nothing. He remembered that meeting as well. \"You never told me why you volunteered to stay you know.\" Moanna continued, looking at the Faun closely when he stayed silent. \"Why did you?\" \"You were an interesting girl.\" The Faun replied looking away. \"Not many people, even a child would want to be friends with a Faun.\" He smiled looking back at her. \"The fairies took a liking to you as well.\" \"Oh,\" Moanna knew that last bit was him trying to steer clear of an awkward subject. She wasn't sure what to say but she'd wanted to talk to him about Stephan. - \"Do you think I should marry Stephan?\" The Faun looked at her shocked when she said this. He wanted to say that she shouldn't but instead he replied. \"You should do whatever makes you happiest.\" - Moanna smiled. He was probably the only person who would tell her that. \"I don't want to marry him.\" The Faun looked over at her. \"Well then do not.\" Moanna laughed. \"I'm glad you're here. I feel we haven't talked in a long time.\" The Faun agreed with this. It seemed that every time he tried to talk with Moanna she was with Bella or Stephan. At least he knew now that she didn't like him. \"Well if you don't mind me asking. Why don't you want to marry Stephan?\" Moanna grew serious. \"I don't love him. I can barely tolerate him. If I marry I want it to be for love.\" \"Do you love anyone now?\" - The Faun hadn't meant to ask that but it had just slipped out. Before Moanna could say anything however the door was flung open and Bella and Stephan walked in. \"Oh hello Moanna!\" Bella called out disguising a frown at the sight of the Faun. \"I've brought you your Prince. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.\" She looked at the Faun pointedly. \"We should leave them alone, shouldn't we?\" The Faun got up at this remark to Moanna's annoyance. He could see her out of the corner of his eye. He was happy she wanted him to stay but he had something he needed to discuss with Bella. \"I hope you are better soon Moanna.\" He smiled and then went out of the room fallowed by Bella. oOoOo Once they were outside the room Bella walked across the hall into her own room. The Faun fallowed her. \"What do you want?\" Bella asked when she saw him in the room. \"To give you a warning.\" The Faun said seriously. \"I know you and that Prince were the cause of both Moanna's accidents.\" Bella's face went white. \"I do not know why and I do not want to know why you did. But know that if you ever do something like that again you will answer to me.\" The Faun turned and left the room leaving Bella too stunned to say anything. oOoOo It was after dinner and Moanna was alone in her room. Dr. Blightly had insisted on her staying her room to eat. That had bought her a few moments of freedom while Stephan was downstairs eating. Her mother had come into the room slightly before and it was all Moanna could do to stop from chaining her to the bed. Yes, ever since Moanna had returned from the surface her mother had gotten far too overprotective. Unfortunately at that moment Stephan walked back into the room. \"Hello my poor Moanna.\" As he had taken to calling her. \"I hope you did not miss me too much while I was gone.\" He looked over to see the bed was empty. \"Moanna? Where are you?\" Moanna sighed, she was sitting on her window seat. It had a clear view of the grounds in front of the forest and she loved it. Now she had that memory back she remembered that it was the view from this window that made her want to explore the forest in the first place. \"I'm over here.\" \"Oh hello Moanna.\" Stephan said walking over bringing the chair with him to sit. Moanna almost groaned at the sight of this. It meant that he would be staying for a while. She had so hoped he was coming in to say goodnight. \"So as I was saying before I went to dinner. In the winters my brother and I used to -\" - Moanna tuned him out as she looked out the window. She really didn't care what he and his brother used to do in the winter. Outside the moon was out usual but unlike in the daytime the stars were out as well. She smiled, she used to wish to see the sun but now she was happier with the moon. It was funny if you thought about it. She had run away from home to see the sun and when she was living on the earth it was the moon that she seemed drawn to. Moanna was drawn from her thoughts as she noticed some fairies flying near the front of the forest. She couldn't hear them as she was too far away. She had gotten pretty good at communicating with the fairies. She found out that they enjoyed laughing quite a bit. These one's looked like they were doing that.Then she saw who the fairies were flying to. It was the Faun, he was sitting on a rock in front of the forest. The moonlight was on him and Moanna could see that he was sketching something on paper in front of him. She couldn't make out what he was drawing though. As she watched the Faun draw with the Fairies surround him Moanna was struck by an odd feeling. It was the same one she had when she'd seen him today. She'd thought it had been excitement because she hadn't seen him in a while and she had something to tell him. But now just watching him she got the same feeling. She recalled the question he asked her. Was she in love with anyone? Why had he asked her that? Did he mean anything by it? And what could he have meant by it? She certainly didn't know the answer. What was being in love supposed to feel like? She looked out the window again. The Faun was still there and Moanna continued to watch him. She wondered if he knew he was being watched. She hoped not, but he had an uncanny way of noticing things like that. Not wanting to be caught she turned around and told Stephan that she was tired and wanted to go to bed. Once he was gone Moanna changed into her nightgown. When she was dressed she went and looked out the window. The Faun was still there drawing. Moanna smiled at the strange feeling she was starting to get used to. She went over to her bed and was trying to figure out what that feeling meant when she fell asleep. - -- -- - -- -- - A/N- I hope you liked the chapter! Remember the more reviews I get the faster I'll update. (Yea attempted blackmail!)[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I do not own Pan's Labyrinth. I am not making any money from this. I am getting tired of saying this... A/N- Again thanks for the wonderful reviews! You guys are awesome. Just a quick note: the words in italics are the fairy language (translated or not). Remember to leave a review…. Chapter Six: Revelations - It had been a week since Moanna had been injured. By this time her head was feeling much better and she was happy she was going to be able to leave her room without getting in trouble. At this moment she was playing a game of chess. She usually found chess to be most enjoyable but this time she was playing against Stephan. The one entertaining thing about playing Stephan was that she won every game. Stephan really wasn't very good at thinking ahead, of course Stephan always claimed he was letting her win. \"So you know I will be heading home soon.\" Stephan commented while moving a chess piece. That brought Moanna out of her bored daze. \"What? Really?\" She tried not to sound happy when she was really ecstatic. Now she only had to get rid off Bella. \"Yes.\" Stephan went on, clearly not noticing Moanna's obvious lack of interest. \"I know you shall miss me greatly but I must return to my home.\" He paused then but when Moanna still didn't say anything he continued. \"I have enjoyed our time here together very much and I know I shall miss you greatly.\" Moanna rolled her eyes. This speech had obviously been rehearsed. \"I don't know how I will cope with not being able to see you everyday. So I ask you this, Moanna will you marry me?\" Moanna's eye's widened and she froze, her hand holding a bishop in midair over the chess board. Oh god's he'd asked her. She had really been hoping he wouldn't. What was she going to say? The chess piece fell out of her hand and with a jolt she realized exactly what she had to say. \"I'm sorry Stephan but I can't marry you.\" There she'd said it. She looked over at Stephan and saw he looked astonished. Clearly he had taken her answer for granted. \"You…you won't marry me?\" Stephan asked in disbelief. \"But…but you have to!\" \"I certainty do not have to!\" Moanna burst angrily. \"Well why won't you marry me?\" \"I'm not going to marry you because I don't love you.\" Stephan protested this argument. \"But I love you and you would grow to love me!\" \"I'm sorry Stephan…but no.\" Moanna got up and went to sit on the other side of the room and Stephan stood up. \"Well think about it Moanna, I'm one of the best offers you're going to get.\" Moanna had to resist the urge to throw something at Stephan's head as he walked out of the door. She didn't want any offers! She leaned her head against her knees wishing that life wasn't so confusing. oOoOo An hour after Stephan's proposal Moanna was still sitting in her room staring, lost in thought. She came to when someone knocked on her door. Knowing it wasn't Bella or Stephan (they never knocked) Moanna called out. \"Come in.\" To her disappointment it wasn't the Faun. She hadn't seen him in the past week and was hoping he was coming to see her but it was just her mother. \"My dear how are you?\" The Queen exclaimed coming into the room. \"I'm fine mother.\" Moanna replied. Her mother came over and sat next to her. \"I've heard that you have turned down Prince Stephan's offer of marriage, is this true?\" \"Yes, mother and before you ask why it's because I want to marry for love and I do not love Stephan. The Queen was thoughtful. \"Moanna I know you do not want to hear this but most marriages for royalty are not made for love. I think you would be very happy with Stephen. It seems he is in love with you.\" She paused as if coming to a decision. \"Your father and I will not force you to marry Stephan but you will have to be married one day. I advise you to think carefully over Stephan's proposal. \"Yes mother.\" Moanna sighed, glad she wasn't being forced into marriage…just yet anyway. \"Good, now Dr. Blightly is coming up to give you one last checkup. Just to be sure you're fine.\" With a smile the queen walked out of the room. - A few minutes later Dr.Blightly came into the room. \"Hello Moanna. Feeling well I hope.\" \"Much better, my head doesn't hurt at all.\" \"Good. Now you'll be disappointed to know that you no longer have to take the medicine you love so much.\" \"I'm heartbroken.\" Moanna replied sarcastically. \"I know you are.\" Dr.Blightly laughed. - Once he'd finished Dr.Blightly proclaimed that Moanna was as healthy as she had ever been. As he was packing up Moanna decided to ask him a question that was pestering her. She knew he would at least try to give her an honest answer. \"Dr. Blightly?\" \"Yes Moanna?\" Dr. Blightly replied as he was packing his bag up. \"Do you know what it feels like to be in love?\" She saw he was startled by her question. \"I can't say I do Moanna. May I ask why you want to know?\" Moanna thought to herself. She might as well tell him. \"I think I might be. In love that is.\" At her words Dr. Blightly dropped the bottle he had been holding. He looked at her, astonished. \"You don't mean that prince?\" \"No!\" Moanna exclaimed with a horrified look on her face. \"Not him!\" \"You scared me for a moment there my dear. Between the prince and your cousin going around claiming you're getting married. I thought…oh never mind. But if you don't mind me asking who is it that you think you might be in love with?\" Moanna looked rather uncomfortable. \"Well I've never been in love before so I don't know what it's like. So I might be in love and I might not be.\" She said avoiding the real question. \"Well, I've never been in love before Moanna but I understand that it's a strange feeling. You can't stop thinking of one person and you….well there's no real way to explain love. At some point you'll just know.\" \"Oh.\" Moanna sighed slightly disappointed. \"Well it doesn't matter anyway.\" \"Why not Moanna?\" \"The person I might \" She stressed the word might. \"have feelings for would never think of me in that way.\" Dr. Blightly smiled mysteriously. \"Well I don't confess to knowing everything Moanna but I do think that you're wrong. Moanna watched him leave, confused and alone with her thoughts. oOoOo With everything going on in Moanna's mind she decided to go for a walk to clear her head. As she walked through the castle she couldn't stop thinking about what Dr.Blightly had said. He seemed to think he knew who she'd been talking about. Did he? She was just walking outside when her will caved and she admitted to herself what she felt she knew all along. She had feelings of the Faun. It was a simple thing but admitting it to herself made her feel as though a small weight had been lifted from her shoulders. She wondered if Dr. Blightly really did know who she had been talking about. Because if he did he seemed to think she was wrong in thinking that the Faun could ever think of her as more then a friend. When she looked around she discovered she had walked over to the front of the forest. She was standing in front of the rock she had seen the Faun sitting on about a week ago. She had never gotten to see what he'd been drawing. Moanna went and sat on the large rock to think some more. While lost in thought she didn't notice someone walking over to her till they called out her name. \"Moanna!\" Moanna shook her head and sighed. It was Bella walking down from the castle. \"Oh Moanna, I've been looking for you everywhere.\" Bella said once she reached the rock. \"Whatever are you doing out here?\" \"I'm thinking.\" Moanna replied calmly. \"Why, did you want me for anything?\" Bella was about to reply when something caught her eye. \"Is that your paper Moanna?\" Bella pointed to a crevice in the rock and sure enough there was a piece of paper sticking out. \"I don't know.\" Moanna said curiously reaching for the paper. \"I used to hide things there when I was little but there shouldn't be anything there now….\" She trailed off. The crevice was fairly deep and she had pulled out a medium piece of paper that was rolled up. She unrolled it carefully and looked at it. Seeing what was on it Moanna's eyes widened. \"What is it Moanna?\" Bella asked trying to get a view of the paper. Moanna didn't reply, she couldn't. On the paper was…a picture of her. It was a sketch of herself looking out of her window from her room. The drawing was skillfully done and Moanna couldn't help but stare at how realistic it looked. Bella leaned foreword to see the picture. \"Impressive Moanna. Do you know who drew it?\" Moanna gathered her thoughts together. \"I think….\" She began, trailed off and started again. \"I think…the Faun drew it.\" She really didn't think this. She knew it. She had seen other pictures he had drawn and it was impossible for this to have been done by anyone else. Bella wrinkled her nose. \" So he's been stalking you? That's creepy. I'm glad that faun's not in love with me.\" As soon as she said this her face went white and she realized what she had done. She mentally cursed herself. She looked over at Moanna who had frozen in place. \"He…he...loves me?\" Moanna stammered. \"Really?\" \"…Uh yes but don't you think that's horrible?\" Bella tried desperately. Moanna looked at Bella biting her lip to stop herself from grinning. \"Don't you see? I never thought he could love me.\" Bella stared at Moanna. \"Wait, you mean you…\" \"Love him?\" Moanna finished now smiling. It felt good telling someone even if that someone was here cousin. \"Yes I do\" \"B…but what about Stephan? I know he was planning on asking you to marry him.\" Moanna rolled her eyes. \"He did ask me to marry him. I said no.\" \"What!\" Bella yelled causing Moanna to look out her in astonishment. \"You have to marry Stephan!\" \"Why do you care who I marry?\" \"Why do I care? Why do I care? I'll tell you why I care!\" She grabbed the drawing from Moanna's hands and ripped it in half. She grabbed her arm and started to drag her away. Moanna cried out in protest but Bella had a firm grip on her arm. As she was being dragged away Moanna spotted a fairy near the front of the forest. Shouting out in fairy Moanna called for help. \" Aolto!\" The fairy quickly flew up to her and as she was trying to get away from Bella it started to attack Bella's face. Yelling Bella let go and Moanna ran into the forest. Before they could blow away Moanna grabbed the two parts of the drawing. She folded them quickly and stuffed them into her pocket. She was about to run even further into the forest to hide when she turned around to find Stephan standing in front of her. \"I'm sorry Moanna. But you really should have accepted my proposal.\" He grabbed her arm and the next thing Moanna knew was blackness. Stephan picked up the unconscious Moanna and carried her up to the castle with Bella walking behind. oOoOo When Moanna woke up she didn't know where she was. She looked around to see she was in a small room with a tiny window near the top. Just at that moment the door opened and Bella walked in. \"Where am I?\" Moanna asked as calmly as she could. Bella smiled at her condescendingly. \"I thought we should have a little conversation before you do anything you might regret.\" Not waiting for Moanna to answer Bella continued to talk and started to pace in front of Moanna. \"Now Moanna dear, I think you're a little confused. You see we are both princesses and as princesses it is our duty to marry princes. It's a very simple rule. But no, you couldn't follow this rule could you? You had to fall in love with a faun!\" \"I don't see how who I love had anything to do with you.\" Moanna said stiffly. Bella laughed. \"That's the funny part, it shouldn't! I shouldn't care at all but I can't get married until you marry Stephan.\" \"Why?\" Bella calmed down a bit. \"The prince I'm supposed to marry is Stephan's older brother. He will rule his Kingdom when his father steps down and I will rule with him. The problem is that his father says I can not marry him until his brother marries you.\" Bella smiled nastily. \"That way he and I will have control of both our country and yours. Stephan is so easy to manipulate.\" Moanna stared at her cousin in amazement. It seemed to her that Bella had finally lost her mind. \"You're crazy if you think I'll marry Stephan to help you control this kingdom!\" \"Well I'm sorry Moanna dear but you don't have much of a choice in the matter.\" Bella glanced at Moanna smugly and then pulled something out of her pocket. It was a pocket watch. After checking the time Bella looked up at Moanna. \"While you were unconscious you were given a rare poison. In about fifteen minutes you'll lose your memories. You won't remember who that faun is let alone that you're in love with him!\" With that Bella laughed cruelly and walked out of the room. Moanna stood in the room her entire body stiff from shock. When she heard the door close she jumped and ran to the door. By the time she'd gotten there the door had been locked and Moanna was reduced to kicking the door in frustration. - After wasting five minutes trying to break down the door Moanna looked around the rest of the room. The room had a table and two chairs in it. The window was too small to crawl through even if she could reach it. With that thought it in her mind Moanna pulled the table under the window and pilled the chairs on top. She climbed on top of the top chair and was able to see out the window. From her view she could tell that she was in a partly underground room. She could see the grounds but there wasn't anyone there. After another five minutes Moanna had been able to smash a pane of glass out with a rock she had found in the corner of the room. She was about to call for help when she heard someone faintly calling her name. It took her a moment to realize why the voice sounded so strange. It was the fairy from the forest that had tried to help her escape. Moanna called out in fairy. \"Over here.\" Hearing her voice the fairy flew over and through the broken window. As quickly as she could Moanna attempted to explain her circumstances. She wasn't fluent in fairy but she thought she'd gotten the main points across. \" Can you tell the Faun?\" When the fairy nodded Moanna sighed in relief. \" What is your name?\" \" Lillandra\" The fairy replied. \" Thank you Lillandra….\" Moanna trailed off and her eyes glazed over. She stiffly sat down on the table and stared into space. At first the fairy Lillandra tried to get Moanna's attention but when she was just ignored she flew out of the window determined to find the Faun. All fairies knew how the Faun felt about Moanna and they were all fond of the princess themselves. She had played with them when she was little and Lillandra knew she couldn't stand if anything happened to Moanna. She just wished she knew where the Faun was. oOoOo That night Bella had finished telling Moanna exactly what she had to do. Without her memories Moanna had know idea who or where she was and was easily led into believing anything. Bella smirked, her plan was working perfectly. At this rate Moanna would be easier to manipulate then Stephan. - The royal family and its guests had just finished diner and were in the sitting room when Stephan cleared his throat. \"I do not know if you know yet but my dear Moanna has agreed to marry me.\" The room went silent at this announcement and the Queen looked over at her daughter gravely. \"Is this true Moanna?\" Moanna nodded smiling. She didn't remember but Bella had told her that she was in love with this Stephan. She must have said yes if she was in love with him. \"We hope to marry soon.\" Stephan continued. He failed to see the suspicious looks the Queen and Dr. Blightly were giving him. However the King did see them and spoke up. \"That is indeed wonderful news but perhaps your wedding should be postponed until after the baby is born. I know Moanna will not want to miss her siblings birth. Frowning slightly Bella asked. \"Well what about a betrothal ceremony? We could have that soon.\" Not seeing any reason to refuse this request the King agreed. \"Very well. Moanna my dear if this is what you truly want then I give you my blessing. You and Prince Stephan will become betrothed in a months time.\" The little gathering broke up after this. Dr. Blightly tried to get Moanna's attention but she just followed Bella and Stephan outside. - Once outside the three of them were sitting on a bench. Stephan had his arm around Moanna's shoulder and was talking to her as she stared blankly. Out of the corner of her eye Bella thought she had seen someone so she went over to look. She saw the Faun walking and went over to him. \"I hope you realize you're not welcome here.\" Bella said not even bothering to hide the disgust in her voice. The Faun ignored it and said stiffly. \"I'm looking for Moanna.\" Smiling nastily Bella replied. \"Haven't you heard? Moanna's getting married to Stephan. Isn't that just wonderful.\" The fake cheeriness was back in her voice. The Faun viewed Bella suspiciously. \"You're lying.\" \"I am not. See for yourself how close they are.\" Bella pointed over to where Moanna and Stephan were sitting. When the Faun didn't say anything Bella turned back to him. \"I suggest you leave now. Moanna had no wish to see you now or ever again.\" With that she turned around and walked back over to Stephan and Moanna. When she reached them Moanna asked her. \"Bella who was that you were talking to over there?\" \"Oh no one you know Moanna.\" But as Stephan continued to talk. Moanna couldn't help but think she did…. -- -- - -- -- -- - -- -- - Well I hope you liked the chapter! Remember to leave a review![Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I do not own Pans Labyrinth…..surprise, surprise. A/N- Again thanks for the reviews! A note, Moanna may seem very OOC, she's supposed to at points because she doesn't remember anything. I hope you like this chapter. Chapter Seven: Grasping at Memories It was the morning after Moanna's startling announcement and the Faun was deep in the forests thinking. Moanna had agreed to marry that prince, it was nothing he shouldn't have expected. But she had seemed so honest when she was telling him that she didn't want to marry Stephan. He sighed deeply, why had he even begun to hope, hope that Moanna would love him? It was useless, she was a princess and she would marry a prince. There was nothing he could do. While he was sitting there a fairy flew up to him. He recognized her (he knew all the fairies by name) it was a fairy named Lillandra. \"Hello Lillandra.\" He acknowledged her as she was floating in the air. This seemed to be a mistake as the fairy started talking far too quickly to be understood. \" Slow down. You're going too quickly.\" The Faun waved at fairy trying to calm her down. Lillandra stopped for a moment to catch her breath then quickly delivered her message. Once she was finished the Faun looked at her with something akin to amazement. \"Moanna lost her memory? Are you sure she hasn't just fallen in love with…Stephan.\" \" Moanna doesn't love Stephan.\" Lillandra exclaimed. \" She loves you!\" The Faun smiled sadly at her. \" I'm afraid you're mistaken my friend. She would never love me.\" \" I saw it all, come I will prove it to you.\" Lillandra flew ahead of him and waited for him to get up. Her story seemed unbelievable but it was possible. He had to see Moanna for himself. -- -- -- They soon reached the palace gardens where Lillandra said that she had seen Moanna reading a book that morning. They managed to find her by herself on a bench and walked up to her. Moanna put her book down and stared at them. \"Hello, do I know you?\" Moanna was puzzled. It was the strange person Bella had been talking to the night before. She felt like she knew him from somewhere but she couldn't remember where. The Faun looked over at Lillandra. \"She doesn't remember me?\" \" I told you. Her cousin did something to her head. She poisoned her! Moanna wanted me to warn you.\" \" Why would her cousin do this?\" \" Well… Moanna just told her that she wouldn't marry Stephan because….she was in love with you.\" The Faun stood there in shock. Moanna loved him? Well used to, she didn't even remember his name now. He turned back to look at Moanna who was looking back and forth from him to Lillandra in amazement. \"Are you speaking another language?\" The Faun smiled down at Moanna. \"Yes actually. But allow me to introduce myself, you may call me the Faun.\" \"Oh, hello. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Moanna.\" \"I know.\" The faun said quietly. \"I'm sorry but I must be going. Do you perchance know where I can find Dr. Blightly?\" \"I'm sorry, who?\" Moanna looked confused. \"I've never heard of anyone by that name. Perhaps my cousin Bella knows. You can ask her, she tells me to ask her any questions I have.\" The Faun looked oddly at Lillandra. \"Maybe we will.\" After saying goodbye to Moanna and walking up by the castle the Faun turned to Lillandra. \"You were right. She can't remember a thing. I'm going to ask Dr. Blightly if he has an antidote for the poison. I want you to stay and follow Moanna around. Try to see if you can jog her memory.\" Lillandra agreed and flew back down to where Moanna was sitting. The Faun went into the castle where he was hoping he would find Dr. Blightly. oOoOo Dr. Blightly was copying some notes out of a book when the Faun walked into the room. He took one look at the Faun and realized something was very wrong. \"What's wrong?\" \"It's Moanna.\" - Once he'd explained everything the Faun watched Dr. Blightly as he cupped his head in his hands. \"I never believed such a poison existed.\" \"Do you have an antidote then?\" \"I'm afraid not.\" He replied getting off his stool and walking over to the bookshelf. \"I've never heard of this before. With memory many things are uncertain. It could be a poison that alters the brains functions and causes it to give itself amnesia. If that's so then she might regain her memories over time. Though if there is such a poison then it should be in one of these books.\" He started flipping through the pages of a large dusty brown book titled Poisons while the Faun went to look for information in the books he had. oOoOo Lillandra was following Moanna around as she paced the garden. She wondered what Moanna was thinking about. Before she could make herself known she heard someone coming so she flew into a hiding spot. She was hidden in a tree and could see that it was Bella walking into the garden. \"Hello Moanna!\" Bella called out, waving. Moanna waved back and waited for Bella to come over. \"So I've started planning your betrothal ceremony. I have wonderful news!\" Moanna attempted to look interested. \"What is it Bella?\" \"You're betrothal ceremony has been moved up. It takes place in a week. Isn't that splendid?\" Moanna sighed, it would have been better if she could remember falling in love with this Stephan. But as she couldn't disappoint Bella (for some reason) so she smiled and nodded. \"Yes…well Moanna why don't you spend the rest of the day in your room. That way you won't run into….anyone you wouldn't want to talk to.\" \"Ummm…okay Bella. Whatever you think is best.\" Bella smirked and looped her arm around Moanna's. \"I knew there was a reason I liked you this way.\" \"What?\" \"Oh nothing.\" -- Bella left Moanna on the staircase leading up to her room. Moanna watched as Bella walked away smiling. Her cousin had a strange smile, on anyone else Moanna would have said that it looked sinister…but Bella wouldn't do anything evil…would she? Moanna made sure her cousin was far away before she started to walk back down the stairs. She quietly made her way to a little known side door. The night before she had explored her room and found a map with little notes on it that seemed to be written in her own handwriting. Again she didn't remember writing them but it certainly was coming in helpful when she didn't remember how to make her way around her own home. After making her way out she found herself in front of the forest. Again she found something familiar about the whole situation. She felt that there was something inside the forest that was drawing her into it. Not remembering if anyone had told her anything bad about the forest Moanna started to walk in. Unknown to Moanna, Lillandra was still following her. When she saw Moanna was going into the forest she moaned. The forest was easy enough to get lost in when you did have some idea where you were going. With Moanna's missing memories and the fact that she was just wandering around meant that Moanna was in trouble. Deep trouble, Lillandra followed behind the oblivious girl hoping she would be able to steer the girl away from the more dangerous things in this forest. It couldn't be that hard, could it? -- -- As it turns out Lillandra had her work cut out for her. Moanna seemed to want to walk into every dangerous place the forest had. On a positive note Moanna had seemed to understand that when Lillandra was flying in front of her waving her hands it meant she shouldn't go that direction. - With an irritated wave at the fairy Moanna turned around from the path she'd been taking. Another wrong direction, it seemed to her that everyway she turned was some sort of wrong direction. As she turned around she must have done so too quickly because she lost her balance and tripped over a tree root that was sticking out. She cried out in pain as she hit the ground. She ignored the fairy flying over to her as she concentrated on getting up. However as she got to her feet a burst of pain shot through her ankle and she sat down quickly under a tree. The fairy flew in closer as she was examining her ankle. \"I must have twisted it or something.\" Moanna muttered to herself. She was distracted when she noticed the fairy flying off. \"Hey, you can't just leave me here!\" Moanna called out, and then shook her head as the fairy flew away. It probably had no idea what she had just said. She went back to sitting on the ground trying to figure out what to do next. - After many failed attempts to start walking Moanna was wondering how long she'd been in the forest. It certainly seemed like a very long time to her. She was rubbing her ankle and about to make another attempt to walk when she looked up and saw…the Faun was looking down at her. -- The Faun had a strong feeling of déjà vu as he looked down at Moanna. What was she doing in his forest? \"Are you alright….?\" He asked her hesitantly. Moanna tried to get up and then grimaced in pain. \"I…I think I twisted my ankle.\" She looked at the Faun to see he looked very concerned. She thought this odd as Bella had told her that the Faun was a stranger to her. \"Yes the fairy said it looked like you did. If you would like I can wrap it up for you.\" \"….Okay.\" Moanna replied and watched the Faun take a roll of bandages and start to wrap her ankle. \"It's only temporary.\" The Faun said. \"But it should hold you till we can get you to Dr. Blightly.\" \"Thank-you.\" Moanna said quietly. Very carefully as not to hurt her, the Faun proceeded to wrap up Moanna's ankle. Moanna looked at him as he was doing it. He was so gentle and sweet. Her eyes widened and she was sure that something was coming back to her. But by then the Faun was finished wrapping up her ankle. \"Do you think you can walk?\" The Faun asked breaking Moanna out of her daze. She realized with embarrassment she'd been staring at him and blushed when she replied. \"I'm not sure. I can try.\" She got to her feet and took a couple of steps. She could walk now but not without wincing. \"Here let me help you.\" The Faun offered her his arm, watching her with curious interest as she was blushing again. \"Oh…thank you.\" Moanna replied taking the Fauns extended arm. As they started walking through the forest Moanna decided to attempt some conversation to make the moment less awkward. \"Why were you in the forest?\" The Faun looked at her before replying. \"I live here I happened to be nearby when the fairy came over looking for help.\" \"That was nice of it. I thought it was leaving me there.\" \"No the fairies are very fond of you Moanna. They wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you.\" \"I wish I could remember.\" Moanna said irritably. \"I only have Bella's word on everything but I'm starting to doubt her. For instance, I have the strangest feeling that I know you from somewhere but she says that you're a stranger to me.\" \"Is that so?\" The Faun replied slowing down as they reached the edge of the woods. \"Yes, did I know you before I lost my memory?\" The Faun was silent and Moanna looked at him expectantly. \"Yes, you did.\" The Faun replied quietly. \"I knew it!\" Moanna exclaimed, and then frowned. The Faun saw her look and was hoping she wasn't going to ask him why she was friends with a faun. Bella had been the one telling her things after all. \"So all this time Bella's been lying to me. Why would she do that?\" - \"I think it's because she wants you to marry that prince Stephan.\" A voice answered Moanna from beside her. She shrieked and looked at the person next to her. \"Who are you?\" \"My apologies Princess Moanna. I was just walking down to look for the Faun when I noticed the two of you standing here talking. My name is Dr. Blightly and I'm guessing you don't remember me.\" \"No, sorry.\" Moanna said flushing with embarrassment again. \"Am I supposed to?\" \"Yes but that doesn't matter right now. I'm a doctor and my first calling s to heal people. So care to tell me what you've done to your ankle?\" -- After Moanna had explained what had happened to her. Dr.Blightly and the Faun helped her walk the way up to the castle. Once the doctor was satisfied she'd be all right he told her to get some rest and went to get her some food. This left Moanna and the Faun alone in her bedroom. The Faun looked around the room, it was….emptier, or so it seemed. \"I see you've cleaned out some of your papers.\" The Faun said. \"Have I?\" Moanna asked. \"I don't remember doing that, I wonder where everything went.\" She looked around and noticed her room did seem to be clear of all papers. Suspiciously so, for some reason she seemed to know that there out to have been quite a few papers lying about. Ignoring the Fauns protests Moanna got slowly off her bed and made her way over to the closet where she had found the map to the castle earlier that day. Sitting down carefully she found the wooden box and discovered it was filled with papers. As the Faun walked over she called out. \"Well, I found the papers.\" Looking through them she had no idea what head possessed her to put them in this box. Then she found a drawing of the castle with fairy's flying in front of it. \"Look at this!\" Moanna exclaimed limping back over to the bed, where there was more light. \"I wonder who drew it.\" As she sat on the bed examining the picture the Faun looked at her oddly. If she hadn't put the papers away who had? With a grimace he realized that is was probably Bella trying to stop Moanna from remembering anything. \"Faun, do you know who drew this?\" Moanna asked him and he walked over to see the drawing she was talking about. Once he saw it he froze as Moanna was flipping the picture over to the back. \"Look there's a note. It says \"Happy 11th birthday Moanna, from your friend…the Faun...\" Moanna looked up at the Faun. \"You drew this?\" The Faun nodded as he watched Moanna expression. She was looking oddly at him. \"But that means I've known you since I was at least eleven! How is it that I don't remember you? Why don't I remember anything?\" Moanna was clearly exasperated. The Faun walked over closer to her. \"I'm sure your memories will come back soon.\" \"I hope so.\" - The Faun left when Dr. Blightly came back with some food for Moanna. Outside the door he turned to the doctor. \"Do you have any news?\" \"Well, yes and no.\" The Faun looked at the doctor as if he was mad. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean I have found the poison. It's a rare one, called simply Memoria. It acts in the brain and clouds the part that controls memories.\" \"Is there an antidote?\" The Faun interrupted. \"Yes there is but it's very difficult to make and may not even work.\" \"You have to try.\" \"Don't worry I will. Come and I'll show you the recipe. You may have some ingredients I'll need.\" The two of them walked off down the hallway. oOoOo Two days later Moanna was still in her room. Bella was absolutely furious with her as because of her ankle they had to delay the betrothal ceremony till she could walk. It was night time and as Bella ranted and paced in Moanna's room, Moanna was taking a close look at one of the things she had found in her closet. It was a little box with strange carvings on it. She was about to open it when Bella yelled at her. \"Moanna! Are you paying attention to a word I'm saying?\" \"Sorry Bella.\" Moanna answered, quickly hiding the wooden box so Bella couldn't see it. \"I was distracted.\" \"Well you should listen. I heard you were walking with that disgusting faun, I thought I told you to stay away from him!\" Moanna looked at Bella angrily. \"Don't be so mean to him! He helped be when I twisted my ankle.\" Bella looked like she was going to scream. She breathed deeply trying to control her rage. They get rid of the girl's memory and she still defends the stupid faun. What could do to get her away from him! Bella sighed. \"Well it doesn't matter. You'll be marrying your true love soon.\" She put emphasis on the words true love. \"Then you'll be far away from that horrible faun.\" With this she walked out of the room. - Once she was gone Moanna took out the wooden box again. Opening it slowly she heard the first few bars of what sounded like a lullaby. She put it carefully on her pillow and closed her eyes. She listened to the music till she fell asleep. That night she had strange dreams… --Running, she was running up a tall spiral staircase. Up into the bright light of the sun but the light was too bright and she felt darkness swarm her mind.-- --Her father lay dieing, as her mother looked on crying.-- --The new man she was supposed to call father had thrown her books onto ground.-- --A strange creature showed her a labyrinth-- --Her new dress was ruined-- --Someone was humming a lullaby-- --Her mother was dead-- --A pain went through her chest, and everything went numb as she saw her blood on her hands…there was so much blood….so much blood! Moanna woke up screaming and looked at her hands. They didn't have any blood on them but Moanna still felt the pain on her chest. She closed her eyes and wished she knew what everything meant. After a while the pain subsided and Moanna fell asleep and for the rest of the night she did dream. ---- --- ---- ---- ----- Hope you liked the chapter! Please leave a review.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: I do not own Pan's Labyrinth and I'm still not making any money from this. A/N- Thanks again for the reviews, I hope you like this chapter. Chapter Eight: Of Nightmares and Books The next few nights Moanna had strange dreams. They were fragments, mere slips of images that flitted out of her mind as quickly as they had come. Some seemed pleasant enough. Yet she woke up screaming from others. For some reason after these nightmares she always felt a sharp pain in her chest. Much to Moanna's dismay Bella had convinced Moanna's mother to confine her to her room. Discovering that Moanna had been injured again was enough for the Queen to agree with Bella. So Moanna was sitting alone in her room. What she was trying to do at this time was to go through the papers she had found in her closet. She was hoping that she would be able to find clues to unlock her past. She really was supposed to be lying down but after three days of doing that she was very bored. As a compromise she took the papers over to her bed so that if her mother walked in she wouldn't get in any trouble. Along with the papers a dress was laying on her bed; she had worn it days ago but had just found it at the bottom of her closet. While she was shifting through the papers she noticed something from the corner of her eye. It was a piece of paper sticking out of the dress pocket. Leaning forwards she grabbed the paper, well papers. It was a drawing that had been ripped in half. Curious, Moanna smoothed down the two half's and gasped. It was a picture of her looking out of a window. It was so well done and she knew it was done by the Faun. But why would she have ripped it in half? It looked like it was done with such care, what on earth would have possessed her to try to destroy it? She stared down hard at the picture on the bed. Something wasn't right here. Something was not right at all…. -- -- - -- -- Moanna was in shock or something close to this as the days went on. As her ankle got better Moanna began to escape from her room. She was also starting to avoid the Faun as she wasn't sure if she could face him. She felt guilty for something she didn't even remember doing. She felt as if she was losing her mind. The nightmares were increasing and starting to take a toll on her sleeping habits. The guilt, uncertainty and frustration were starting to mount up in her head. When she did see the Faun he was always giving her odd looks, like he knew something was wrong. Dr. Blightly had also started to ask her how she was feeling. She would have loved to say that she was horrible but as the days lead up to the betrothal ceremony Bella put more and more pressure on her to act normal. Moanna was starting to doubt everything in her life. Even her parents were starting to wonder about her. Her mother had taken to getting an anxious look on her face every time Moanna was in the room. Knowing she was worrying her parents only made Moanna feel guiltier. oOoOo It was officially a week before the betrothal ceremony and Moanna was all ready thanks to the advanced planning of Bella. As happy as Bella was to have the planning over with she was irritable as there were still seven days left. She was also starting to worry about Moanna. Moanna had taken to avoiding everyone. Since that included the Faun she wasn't complaining too much. However Moanna had apparently discovered some very good hiding spots because there were times when even she couldn't find her. Which is what why she was looking for her now. Moanna had snuck away after lunch and now she was stuck combing the castle for that cousin of hers. Oh, why couldn't it ever be easy? -- Moanna was well hidden. The map of the castle she had found had indicated many secret hiding spots. The one she was currently in was a secret one that the spy's used to use. Well that's what the note said on the paper anyway. You got into it by pressing a stone behind a tapestry on the third floor. In the room Moanna was lying down on a bench. It was cool on her face and she was tired. Yet she knew the moment she fell asleep the nightmares would be back. Closing her eyes she lay there listening to the quiet echoes of the people in the castle. After a while Moanna heard a noise, blinking heavily she attempted to locate it. As she looked around the room she heard some footsteps drawing closer. Moanna groaned to herself. Someone had found her hiding spot. This one had been her favorite as well. To tired to really care though Moanna just sat up on the bench and waited for the person to come around the corner. -- --- The Faun had been looking for Moanna. His work with Dr. Blightly was going fairly well but the doctor had said that it would be better for him to work on the antidote by himself. He was still hoping that if Moanna had enough prompts she would regain her memories without a need for the antidote. So he sent the Faun of to do this. For some reason Moanna seemed to be avoiding him and he couldn't figure out why. He was very worried about her. From the look of her she hadn't been getting much sleep. This afternoon he had decided to look for Moanna again but he noticed that he wasn't the only one doing this. Bella and that prince were also looking for her. After avoiding them the Faun had decided to go into one of the castles many secret rooms to think in private. The castle had once been home to a thriving spy trade and there were still usable hidden rooms. The last person he expected to find in the room he'd chosen was Moanna. -- -- Moanna looked up to see who was coming into the room. To her surprise (and slight horror) it was the Faun. She had been doing such a good job up to now at avoiding him. She didn't want to face him feeling so guilty. Stifling a yawn Moanna stared ahead, she saw the Faun looked as surprised to see her as she was to see him. The Faun regained his composure quickly enough and greeted Moanna with a small smile. \"Hello Moanna. I see you've found one of the hiding places in this castle.\" \"I found a map in my room.\" Moanna replied her head nodding a bit. The Faun watched her closely. \"Are you all right Moanna? You look tired.\" \"I'm fine.\" Moanna said quickly then yawned. \"I haven't been getting much sleep lately. That's all.\" She said this as if it were nothing but the Faun perceived something hidden beneath her words. \"Nightmares perhaps?\" Moanna looked up at him, taken aback before realizing he was probably guessing. \"Yes.\" He walked over to sit next to her on the bench. \"Care to tell be about them?\" Moanna looked at her hands. She didn't know why he would want to know her nightmares. However something about him made her feel comfortable so she nodded. \"There are two of them.\" She started, staring hard at the floor. \"In the first one I'm all alone and there a bright, bright light. It should be warm but I'm freezing…then nothing. The worst one is when I'm not alone but I don't know who else is with me. There's a stabbing pain in my chest and when I look down at my hands….\" Moanna choked back a sob as she went on. \"They're covered in blood…oh ..the blood…..\" Tears leaked form her eyes and she quickly wiped them away. She was seventeen she wasn't supposed to cry. The Faun was horrified at this confession. Something was about that poison Moanna had received seemed to be making her relive the memories of her deaths every time she fell asleep. No wonder the poor girl looked exhausted. Not sure what else to do the Faun put her arm around Moanna to stop her from shaking. - Moanna at first was startled when the Faun held her but fatigue overtook her and she closed her eyes and leaned against the Faun. Comforted by his presence she felt that she would be having a much more restful sleep. - The Faun looked down at Moanna leaning against him. She had fallen asleep with her head on his shoulder. She looked peaceful in her sleep and the Faun hoped she wasn't having any nightmares. He hadn't gotten a chance to ask Moanna if she'd been avoiding him. It seemed strange though now, if she'd been avoiding him why would she willingly tell him her dreams then fall asleep on his shoulder? As she slept he ran a finger through her hair. He still marveled at her beauty and wondered if something as lovely as her would ever love something like him. He wished he knew if when Moanna got her memories back would she still feel the same way about him. Not wanting to move and wake Moanna up, the Faun settled against the wall and waited. He had waited for Moanna's return for centuries on earth. He could certainty wait a couple of hours for her to wake up. oOoOo Waking up from a very deep sleep can be somewhat confusing. Even if you know you must have gone to sleep in your bed you still wonder where you are. Moanna was wondering the same thing as she looked around the room she had woken up in. The very strange part about the whole thing was that this wasn't her bedroom. But where was she and what was she leaning on? \"Did you have a pleasant sleep?\" Moanna looked up to see the Faun smiling down at her. She blushed as she straightened up. \"Sorry I didn't mean to fall asleep.\" \"It's all right. You looked very tired, I hope you didn't have any nightmares.\" Thinking about her sleep Moanna realized that she hadn't. \"No I didn't. I don't think I had any dreams….\" She paused. \"That's the first time it in…forever.\" She looked back up at the Faun. \"You're like a good luck charm or something.\" She smiled then her face dropped and she quickly looked in the other direction. \"Moanna?\" The Faun looked at her oddly. \"What's wrong?\" When she didn't say anything he cautiously put his hand on her shoulder. \"You can tell me if something's the matter.\" She didn't want to say anything but she felt so guilty…. She started talking quickly. \"I found this drawing you did of me. I don't know how it ripped but I don't remember ripping it and I really don't see why I would have!\" She said this with such earnestness that the Faun looked at her intently. The fairy had told him about her finding the picture he'd drawn as well as the fact that Bella had ripped it in half. He was guessing Moanna had shoved the pieces in her pocket before she'd been taken. But how could he tell Moanna this? Moanna was still looking away from the Faun. She had no idea what he was going to say. When he started to speak she looked at her feet. \"Moanna, you may not remember what happened to the picture but I know. You weren't the one who tore it in half.\" He saw a look of relief pass over her face and smiled. \"Oh thank goodness.\" Moanna said sighing. \"I've been feeling guilty over the whole thing.\" She paused. \"I don't know why anyone would want to destroy it though it was very well drawn.\" \"Thank you.\" The Faun said awkwardly. He hadn't meant for Moanna to see the picture in the first place. Though he supposed he should have found a better hiding spot. Moanna looked around the room. \"I better go now.\" She got up slowly and walked out of the room being very careful to make sure that she didn't reveal the secret door. - The Faun watched Moanna leave but continued to sit there and think. Dr. Blightly still hadn't finished the antidote and despite his assurance that everything was going well he was starting to worry. There was only a week before the betrothal ceremony took place. He didn't know what he was going to do if they didn't get Moanna's memory back by then. With that thought he decided to go check on Dr. Blightly, hoping the doctor would have good news. -- Doctor Blightly ground his teeth in frustration. He'd been so close this time but again another failure. He sat down on his stool grabbing another text book. There had to be something he'd missed, something he'd overlooked. Flipping through the pages he groaned, there was only one page dedicated to this rare poison and it had little information. He was about to close the book when he noticed something. In very small print under the picture of the Memoria plant was the sentence. For more information about Memoria read Dante's Poisons. Dr. Blightly scratched his head, Dante now why did that name seem so familiar? He got up and went over to his book case. He didn't have that many books on poisons. He stopped in his tracks and rushed down to the castles library. He remembered where he'd seen the name before. He was outside the library and was just going inside when he saw the Faun walking down the hall. He called him over and the Faun followed him in the room. The Faun stayed quiet as Dr. Blightly went looking around at the book cases he seemed to know that the doctor was concentrating. After fifteen minutes had passed Dr. Blightly made a cry of triumph. \"Found it.\" He pulled a small red book off a shelf. On the cover written in gold cursive read Dante's Poisons \"What is it?\" The Faun asked looking at the book curiously. Dr. Blightly walked over to a table and put the book down on it. Flipping to the index he answered. \"This book should contain information about the poison. Here we go.\" He flipped to the appropriate page and started to read. \"Yes let's see. Memoria is an extremely rare poison…yes we knew that….here we are.\" He sighed in visible relief. \"There is an antidote.\" The Faun walked quickly over to the book. \"Does it say what it is?\" Dr. Blightly took another look at the book. \"It's a mixture of plants….\" He started reading silently. After a few seconds he looked up smiling. \"I think we can make this. It's all fairly simple as antidotes go.\" The Faun sighed in relief. The two of them didn't hear someone run from the doorway and down the hallway. oOoOo Bella ran into Stephan's room. \"They found it!\" She gasped out, coming to a stop. \"I told you to get rid of that book!\" Stephan looked up from polishing his sword. \"I did. I hid the book.\" \"In….the….library!\" Bella spat out through clenched teeth. \"Well it was hidden by all the other books.\" Bella moaned and sunk down. \"We're doomed! Do you hear me, doomed. Do you know what will happen if Moanna gets her memory back? Not only will there be no chance of her ever marrying you…we could go to jail! Or worse.\" She rubbed her neck at the thought. \"Can't we get the book back?\" Stephan asked, hoping Bella wasn't going to yell at him again. Bella stopped pacing. \"Yes, but how?\" She snapped her fingers. \"You, you are going to do something useful for once in your life and are going to get it back.\" Stephan's head bolted up. \"Me? How am I supposed to do that?\" Bella shook her head. \"You are right. You are much too stupid. I'll do it myself. Like everything around here.\" She left the room leaving Stephan feeling slightly insulted but he shrugged it off and went back to polishing. -- How to do it? Bella walked down the hallway when she froze and walked back to the doorway she had just passed. Moanna was sitting in her room reading a book. \"Oh there you are Moanna.\" Bella said walking into the room as though she'd meant to the entire time. \"Hello Bella were you looking for me?\" Moanna looked up from her book. \"Yes. Your father wanted me to ask you to go get the Faun and Dr. Blightly to met him in the throne room.\" Moanna frowned a little skeptically but shrugged. \"Very well.\" She got off her bed. \"Do you know where they are?\" Bella pretended to think. \"I may have seen them in the library.\" \"I will go tell them then.\" Moanna walked out of the room and Bella waited a few minutes before following discreetly behind her. - At the doors at the library Bella hid behind a suit of armor and waited for Dr. Blightly and the Faun to leave. She only had to wait a couple of minutes and once they were gone she ran into the library. After a few seconds she was gone running out again. An evil smirk playing on her face and a red book in her hands. -- The Faun and Dr. Blightly walked with Moanna down the hall. \"What does your father want to see us about Moanna?\" Dr. Blightly asked. \"I'm not really sure.\" Moanna said confusion evident in her voice. \"Bella said that he wanted me to tell you he wanted to see you.\" She looked back to see that both the Faun and Dr. Blightly had stopped walking. \"What is it?\" They didn't answer her as they rushed back to the library. Moanna ran after them quite confused. \"She must have taken it!\" Dr. Blightly said as they looked around the library and couldn't find the book. \"Taken what?\" Moanna asked coming into the library. \"Are you talking about this?\" She held up a red book with gold writing on it. \"I found it on the table before we left. I'm sorry I didn't know it was yours. I thought it might be a poem. I guess I got the wrong Dante though.\" She flipped through the book. \"This seems to be about real poisons.\" She looked up from the book to see that the Faun and Dr. Blightly were staring at her in amazement. \"What?\" --- A/N- W ell that's it for this chapter, I hope you liked it. I'm sure you all know the Dante I was talking about. If not it just shows how much of a nerd I am! I command/ suggest politely you all go read Dante's Inferno ! It really is very good. Leave a review and tell me what you thought.[Chapter 9] Disclaimer- I do not own Pans Labyrinth…yet…. walks off laughing evilly A/N- Hey guys, again thanks for the reviews. Really helps me write. Also I put in a slight reference to the movie Labyrinth in this chapter if you can find it! Chapter Nine: Antidote The Faun and Dr.Blightly stood there staring at Moanna in amazement. Dr.Blightly was just about to say something and break the silence when Bella came running into the room. She was winded and breathing deeply so she didn't notice the occupants of the room. She was muttering something that sounded very much like. \"….bloody…red…Dante's Inferno! Ugh!\" She snapped her head up however when the Faun cleared his throat and she realized she had an audience. She quickly tried to compose herself and flattened down the front of her dress. As she was doing this she looked at everyone in the room before coming to stop at Moanna. Noticing the book Moanna was holding she smirked and walked closer to her cousin. Ignoring the Faun and Dr. Blightly she held out her hand and put on a smile. \"Oh Moanna you found the book I had.\" She held up the one in her other hand. \"I think I must have taken this one by accident. Why don't we trade books? I'm sure you'd much rather read this one.\" Moanna looked at her cousin then at the Faun and Dr. Blightly. She could tell that they were trying to tell her not to give Bella the book, but why? Looking back at Bella she replied a little warily. \"I think this book belongs to the Faun and Dr. Blightly, Bella.\" Bella's smile seemed to be even more forced and made her look as though she was in pain. \"Moanna.\" Bella replied speaking slowly as if to a child. \"Give me the book.\" Moanna remembered Bella telling her that she should do everything she said but she didn't want to give Bella the book. She moved closer to the Faun and put the book slightly behind her back. \"I don't think I will Bella.\" Bella's eyes widened in shock. \"Moanna! What are you doing?\" - \"What's going on in here?\" The King and Queen had entered the library. Stephan was following behind them. \"Moanna has my book.\" Bella said quickly. \"I left it here by mistake.\" \"It's not her book.\" Moanna replied just as quickly. \"Whose book is it then?\" The King asked, surveying everyone in the room gravely. Dr. Blightly took that moment to speak up. \"It belongs to the castle library your majesty but the Faun and I were using it. It's a book on poisons and I'm doing some research on a certain type.\" The King nodded then looked over at Bella waiting for her story. She stood there for a moment before she realized what was going on. \"Umm…well, I was…..\" She trailed off. \"Never mind, I didn't want it anyway.\" An idea suddenly struck her. \"But now that you're here your majesties.\" She looked over at the Queen. \"I just wanted to say that everything is ready for the betrothal ceremony. I think we should have it soon….perhaps tonight. We only need you to preside over it your majesties. It was going to be a small thing anyway. Don't you think that if we're all ready we should do it sooner rather then later?\" The King and Queen looked at their daughter after Bella had said this. They were worried about her, she seemed so distant lately. \"Moanna?\" The Queen asked hesitantly. \"Do you want to be betrothed today?\" As Moanna grew thoughtful the Queen went on. \"You have to remember that being betrothed here is almost like marriage in a way. It's binding.\" Moanna looked up from the spot on the ground she'd been staring at. Slowly she took a breath. Her face wrinkled like she was trying to remember something. \"I…I'm…sorry Stephan…I can't marry you…. I just don't remember…if…\" Trailing off Moanna walked over to Dr. Blightly and handed him the book. Then she turned to face the amazed people. \"I'm sorry.\" With tears pricking her eyes she ran out of the room. Dr. Blightly looked around the room. Bella looked like she was about to erupt with anger and Stephan was glancing around nervously. The King was attempting to stop his heavily pregnant wife from running after Moanna. Dr. Blightly sighed and turned back to the Faun who was watching the room impassively. \"Go.\" He said simply. The Faun cocked his head to the side questioningly. His eyes were the only thing that showed any trace of emotion. Dr. Blightly rolled his eyes. \"I'm going to work on the antidote now Faun. You go see to Moanna.\" With that he left the room. When he was gone the Queen walked over to the Faun. She had a sad smile on her face. \"Go after her please.\" Was all she said before bowing her head and walking out of the room holding her husbands hand.\" The Faun glanced over at Bella who was yelling at Stephan to go and find Moanna, he shook his head and walked out of the room. He had an idea where Moanna might be heading. oOoOo As she ran away Moanna had the slightest feeling of déjà vu. Ignoring it she quickly made her way up to the third floor and to the tapestry that held the secret room. In a few moments she was inside and she walked slowly over to the bench and sat down. She sat in silence trying to figure out the answer to her biggest question. Why couldn't she remember anything? - After a few minutes she looked up to see the Faun standing in front of her. \"Oh, I forgot you knew how to get in here.\" Moanna said tucking her hair behind her ears. She noticed the Faun looked slightly sad when she said this and she realized how rude she must have sounded. \"Sorry.\" She muttered. \"Um…sit with me?\" The Faun walked slowly over to the bench. He looked as if he was unsure what to say. \"Are you alright Moanna?\" Moanna laughed bitterly. \"Not really. I have no idea who I am. I can't remember! I was supposed to get married to that prince and I can't even remember falling in love with him!\" She looked at her hands. \"And I only have Bella's word that I was ever in love with him in the first place and I'm not sure I can trust her anymore.\" There was a long moment of awkward silence as Moanna looked around the room. \"I guess I should go tell my mother I'm all right.\" Moanna said as she got up off the bench. She looked back at the Faun who had gotten up as well. \"I'm sorry.\" The Faun looked at her curiously. \"What are you sorry for Moanna?\" \"I'm sorry I don't remember you.\" \"It's not your fault Moanna.\" The Faun replied in a calming voice. Moanna looked thoughtfully at the Faun. Every time she saw him there was a slight nagging feeling in the back of her mind. She knew she'd known him before she'd lost her memory and they'd been friends. But she didn't know how close they'd been, she didn't know if she'd known him when she was little. All she knew was that she felt comforted with him around. There was something about this creature that seemed to draw her to him. She had been starting to notice however that the people of the court tended to avoid the Faun. She didn't see why though. Maybe she did and she just couldn't remember. She could ask him but what kind of question would that be? Why do people avoid you? Yes wouldn't that be an awkward question to ask. However the Faun looked at her closely. \"Moanna….is there something you wanted to ask me?\" Apparently he could read minds as well. Moanna thought to herself unsure of what she should say. She decided to lie. \"Umm…will you walk with me to see my mother?\" The Faun gave her an odd look as though he knew that wasn't the question she'd wanted to ask. But he nodded his head. \"As you wish.\" They walked out of the secret room and down the hallway. Moanna was walking slowly as she really had no idea what she was going to tell her mother. The Faun noticed her reluctance. As they were walking he paused and turned to Moanna. \"If you like I can tell the Queen that you will talk to her tomorrow. It is fairly late and you should probably get some rest.\" Moanna smiled gratefully at the Faun. \"Oh will you?\" Impulsively she hugged him. \"Thank you.\" After a moment of slight confusion the Faun hugged her back. \"You're welcome.\" Moanna stepped back a few seconds later knowing fully well that for some reason she was blushing again. If the Faun noticed he didn't say anything about it. \"I'll walk you to your room then.\" Moanna glanced over at him. His face was very hard to read but he looked like he was smiling slightly. - As they walked down the hallway noticed that it was very quiet. The only sounds she could hear were the noise of the Fauns hooves and her own footsteps as they walked. Listening closely however Moanna realized that this was the way it must always be. She'd just been around Bella so long that she was accustomed to much more noise, As they reached the door of her room Moanna opened it and smiled again. \"Thank you again.\" The Faun nodded in response and to his surprise Moanna stood on her tiptoes and quickly kissed him. Before he had a chance to say anything she was in her room and the door was closed. Staring at the door with more then a touch of astonishment the Faun touched his lip with one of his long fingers. He smiled slightly then turned to go and look for the Queen. As he walked off he didn't know that Moanna was leaning against the back of the door, her hands over her mouth and her eyes wide. Why had she done that? More importantl,y how was she supposed to sleep now? oOoOo The next morning the Faun was talking to Dr. Blightly as the doctor was mixing together ingredients. Dr. Blightly noticed that the Faun had a strange expression on his face the entire time. However they were discussing at that moment the antidote. \"There is this one plant that I don't have.\" Dr. Blightly opened a green text book to a picture of a plant. It had three green and brown leaves and had red berries on it. \"It's called a Letta plant but I've never seen it before.\" He sighed. \"I have no idea where we can find it.\" The Faun glanced at the picture. \"I believe I may know that plant.\" He looked again at the picture again. Thinking deeply he went through his memory, he was connected to the forest and knew everything in it. \"Yes, I'm sure I can find it.\" \"Excellent.\" Dr. Blightly smiled. \"One more thing though.\" He was about to say something when he was interrupted by Moanna who had come running into the room. She looked around the room breathless and slightly embarrassed. \"Sorry…I was…avoiding Bella.\" She straightened her dress and tried to look less flustered. She also made an effort not to look at the Faun. \"That's what I was going to talk about.\" Dr. Blightly said. \"I don't think it's safe for you to be by yourself Moanna.\" \"Why?\" Moanna asked confused. \"It's a long story but you shouldn't be by yourself. Why don't you go with the Faun to find this plant?\" He turned to the Faun. \"It isn't anywhere too dangerous is it?\" The Faun thought deeply. \"No it's as safe as the forest will ever be.\" Moanna was looking curiously at the picture of the plant. \"What is this plant for?\" Dr. Blightly looked at the Faun who nodded. \"It's a plant were looking for, we're hoping to use it in….something to get your memory back.\" At this Moanna's eyes widened. \"Really?\" Dr. Blightly smiled at her. \"Yes, so if you go with the Faun now I'll continue to work on this.\" Moanna looked over at the Faun for the first time since she entered the room. Glad she had managed not to blush she asked. \"Can I come with you then?\" The Faun bowed his head slightly. \"Of course.\" - As they made their way down to the forest Moanna noticed that the Faun wasn't saying anything about what had happened the night before. She wondered if that was because he didn't know what to say. That's certainty why she wasn't bringing it up. She had no idea why she'd kissed him. It had just seemed….right. She sighed as they reached the edge of the forest. She was worried about getting her memories back, what if she got them back and found out that she really was supposed to be in love with Stephan? She glanced up at the Faun as they walked. He seemed to notice and as she looked away quickly she noticed he had a strange look on his face. She hoped he wasn't mad at her. She spoke up at that moment hoping to end the awkward silence. \"Where are we going Faun?\" \"The plant should be around here.\" The Faun replied looking ahead. \"I believe we will find it soon.\" There was as a pause before Moanna continued talking. \"Do you think I'll get my memory back soon?\" The Faun looked down at Moanna and replied softly. \"I hope so.\" - As they traveled deeper into the forest a couple of fairies flew around them. Moanna watched as the Faun was talking to them. It was funny because sometimes she was sure that she could understand what the fairies were saying. But that wasn't possible…was it? She stopped suddenly as the Faun stopped in his tracks. He put his hand up. \"It's near here.\" Moanna looked at him curiously. \"How do you know that?\" The Faun looked at her with a small smile on his face. \"I am the Guardian of this forest. I know where everything is in it.\" They walked a little further over a small hill and down to a small stream. The Faun walked slowly over to the edge of the river. \"Do you have the bag Moanna?\" \"Yes.\" Moanna walked over taking the specimen bag Dr. Blightly had given her off her back. \"I'll get it.\" Very carefully and with precision she hadn't been sure she had Moanna uprooted the small plant and gently put it in the bag. \"There we go.\" Moanna said happily as she put the bag back around her shoulder. \"That was a piece of cake.\" After she said this Moanna turned and tripped over a root. She got up quickly slightly embarrassed and dusted herself off. \"I'm fine.\" She replied when she saw the Faun looking at her. He just shook his head and they continued to walk. As they walked out of the forest Moanna made sure not to squish the plant in the bag. She wasn't sure what part of it Dr. Blightly needed. They were walking in silence again. She wished she knew some way to break the quiet that seemed to have fallen over the Faun and herself. She was saved the trouble of attempting conversation though when she noticed Stephan walking across the palace grounds. Pointing him out to the Faun they went the long way up to one of the castle's side doors. As they walked into the castle Moanna was still trying to think of what she wanted to say. She wanted to offer some sort of explanation to the Faun before she got her memory back. If whatever Dr. Blightly was working on would even work. \"We should take the plant up to Dr. Blightly now.\" The Faun said breaking the silence. \"Okay.\" Moanna replied as they started to walk up the hallway. She looked at the Faun as they walked and took a deep breath. \"Um…Faun?\" He turned to look down at her. \"Yes, Moanna?\" \"Uhh… about yesterday….\" She trailed off unsure of what to say. When the Faun didn't say anything Moanna continued. \"I'm not…really sure…why I…\" She stopped talking in shock they turned the corner and walked into Dr. Blightly's room. oOoOo Dr. Blightly was picking up pieces of glass beakers of the floor, shaking his head sadly. He looked up when he heard the Faun and Moanna come in. \"Hello. I'm afraid we've suffered a bit of a setback.\" He gestured to the mess around him. \"I went to get another book from the library and someone added something to the mixture to make it explode.\" \"Are you all right?\" Moanna asked. \"Yes, I'm quite all right.\" Dr. Blightly waved his hand. \"It wasn't that large of an explosion. More importantly though, do you have the Letta plant?\" \"Yes, we retrieved the plant.\" The Faun said after he had finished examining the room. \"But how long will this take to make again?\" \"A couple of days, not that long.\" Dr. Blightly said reassuringly as he received the bag from Moanna. \"It has to be made just right or Moanna might lose her memories forever.\" Moanna's eye's widened when she heard this. \"I'm just going to go to my room then.\" When no one objected Moanna left the room quickly. Never get her memories back? How would she be able to live without them? She had no idea what she was going to do. - Inside her room Moanna closed the door quickly then went to lie on her bed. Out of the corner of her eye she noticed that on the table there was a plate and cup with a note next to them. Curious she went over to read the note. The note was apparently from her mother and said that she'd sent up some juice and some bread for Moanna seeing how she had missed lunch. Not really hungry, Moanna quickly drank the juice down in a couple of gulps. The walk in the forest had left her very thirsty. After a couple of seconds though she started to get a little tired….then her head felt dizzy…blackness started to creep around the edges of her vision. She only vaguely heard someone knock on the door and as she called out to say they could come in she found that she was slurring her speech. As numbness spread over her entire body she slumped and fell to the ground unable to move. She could still see but only as if through a vague smoky mist. The person outside of her door must heard her because the door opened and the Faun walked in. Seeing her on the floor he rushed over to see what was wrong. As she looked up through the mist in her vision she noted that for the first time she could remember the Faun looked scared. She wondered vaguely if she was dieing. As she watched the Faun through her rapidly deteriorating vision she wished she had gotten a chance to tell him….tell him what though? With a final shot of realization, Moanna's eyes went wide and the last piece of the puzzle seemed to fit in its place. She managed to force a smile on her face and the last thing she said before the darkness claimed her was... \"I remember.\" - - - - - - The End….I'm kidding, really I am…please don't kill me! Hope you liked the chapter and points for whoever spotted the small Labyrinth reference. Remember to leave a review![Chapter 10] Disclaimer : I do not own Pan's Labyrinth, I will never own Pan's Labyrinth…however I am hoping to get the movie for Christmas. crosses fingers AN- Wow, I never thought that this story was going to be this long….this is my longest one so far. Again, sorry for the wait. My teachers all seemed to have some evil plot to see how much work they could give before Christmas break. Now please read and review and enjoy... Chapter Ten: The Room in the Mind The Faun went quickly to get Dr. Blightly and the King and Queen. They all came back to the room as quickly as possible. Dr. Blightly wasted no time in going over to Moanna. After examining her he turned away from the bed they had placed Moanna on. \"What is wrong with her?\" The Queen exclaimed, tears running down her face. \"She's been poisoned.\" Dr. Blightly stated grimly. \"With the poison Memoria.\" He shot the Faun a glance out of the corner of his eye. \"Now normally that wouldn't be enough to cause such an affect but I believe she has been given a massive dose.\" \"Will she be all right?\" The Queen grasped her husband's hand. \"Please tell me she's going to be all right.\" Dr. Blightly shook his head slowly. \"I'm not sure if I can…this poison affects the mind, the memory to be specific. Normally this would just cause a memory loss that would be able to be reversed with an antidote. However there was such a large dose, that I do believe that Moanna's own mind is destroying itself. In short, she'd trapped in her own mind as it is slowly killing her.\" At this point the Queen had burst into tears and the King had a strained expression on his face. Looking at Dr. Blightly he asked desperately. \"Can anything be done?\" \"We need someone better acquainted with the mind….\" Dr. Blightly muttered. The Faun, who had been watching Moanna the entire time turned to face Dr. Blightly. \"I may know of someone who could help.\" He glanced over at the King and Queen. \"They may not like her though.\" \"Who?\" Dr. Blightly asked confused, trying to think of someone who'd be of any help in this situation. \"The Lady of the Forests.\" The Faun replied \"But that's just a legend…\" Dr. Blightly started to say. \"No, she is real.\" The Faun answered looking over at the King and Queen. They were looking at him with a cross between hope and skepticism. There was a silence in the room before the Queen broke it by asking tentatively. \"Would…this …would she be willing to help?\" \"We can always ask.\" The Faun replied seriously, he turned towards Dr. Blightly. \"I will go and look for her.\" - He walked out off the room with the doctor hurrying after him. \"Do you even know where to look for this….woman? The legends say she's lives on a high mountain.\" The Faun looked over at the Doctor as they continued to walk. \"The legends are not always the most accurate sources of information. As for her location, she in every forest and so she will be in mine as well. We simply need to call for her.\" \"Well how do you know she will help us?\" Dr.Blightly protested. \"The legends also say that she is unkind and dangerous.\" \"You shouldn't always trust legends and stories Dr. Blightly.\" The Faun replied warily. \"Everything has the potential to be dangerous. As for her helping us, I think she may.\" Dr. Blightly stopped, exasperated in front of the door to the outside. \"How do you know that?\" The Faun gave him an odd look and Dr. Blightly could have sworn he was amused. \"You see, I happen to know the lady of the forests\" \"How?\" \"She's my sister.\" With that statement the Faun walked out of the door. Dr. Blightly just stood there, open mouth for a few seconds before he snapped to and ran to catch up with the Faun. - \"She's your sister? ...\" Dr. Blightly gasped as he finally caught up with the Faun. The Faun glanced at him. \"It is rather complicated...but yes in your human terms she might be called my sister. They stopped in front of the forest and Dr. Blightly watched as the Faun seemed to be mumbled something under his breath. It was in a language he'd never heard before but knowing the Faun it wasn't that surprising. After a few moments the Faun stopped and cocked his head as though he was listening to something but try as he might the doctor couldn't hear anything. Just as he was just wondering if anything was going to happen he heard a noise coming from the forest. They were standing in front of a large tree and at the moment there was cracking noise coming from it. Dr. Blightly looked up to see the Faun gazing at the tree impassively. The Faun obviously knew what was going on, which was good because he didn't. The noise suddenly stopped and Dr. Blightly glanced at the tree again. A woman stepped out through the bark. She had pale skin that had a long green vine growing with red flowers over it and she was wearing a grey toga. Her hair was long and brown but in places you could see streaks of many other colours. Every colour of the forest was represented in her eyes, making it very disturbing when you met her gaze. From what you could see of her ears you could tell they were pointed. Looking at this mysterious woman, Dr. Blightly knew she wasn't human. \"Hello Seda.\" The Faun said bowing politely. \"I trust you are well.\" \"You would be correct.\" Seda said smiling slightly. \"You said you wished to speak to me about something important?\" She trailed off as she saw the Doctor standing next to the Faun. \"There seems to be a human next to you my friend.\" Her voice became stiff and an air of menace seemed to seep through the forest. Without realizing it, Dr. Blightly backed up slightly when she spoke. The Faun took no notice of this. \"He is here with me.\" Nodding, Seda replied. \"Very well then. Now what was it you needed my help with?\" She looked over at the Faun curiously. \"Someone…someone I know has been poisoned.\" The Faun began slowly. Seda looked at him very closely as he said this. \"It can normally be treated easily but…she has been given such a large dosage that she has become trapped in her mind while it destroys itself.\" \"And you want me to go into this persons mind?\" Seda asked sharply. \"Who is this person you want so dearly to save?\" The Faun looked away. \"It is the princess Moanna.\" Seda shook her head. \"I knew it was a mistake assigning you to this forest. It is too close to the humans.\" She sighed. \"Very well then, take me to her.\" Unable to help himself Dr. Blightly asked. \"You'll help her then?\" Seda looked over at him, a little stiffly. \"I will judge for myself whether or not this Moanna deserves help.\" With that said they started to walk back to the castle. ---------- The King and Queen looked up from their seats by Moanna when they heard people come in. Seda walked over to Moanna and looked at her closely. She then turned around to face the rest of the room. \"I need everyone to leave.\" The King was about to say something angrily when the Queen put a hand on his shoulder. They got up and as they were about to go out the door the Queen looked back at her daughter then at Seda. \"Please help her.\" As she said this she allowed the King to guide her out of the room. Dr. Blightly looked around. \"Well, if you want me, I'll be in my office.\" After saying this he gave one more anxious look at Moanna, turned and left the room. Once they were alone in the room Seda turned back to the Faun, her arms folded over her chest. \"I believe I can help her, she's not that far gone.\" She looked up to see that the Faun looked relived. She looked at him pointedly and said in a falsely casual voice. \"What is this girl to you?\" The Faun stared at the floor but replied stiffly. \"I'm her tutor and a friend.\" Seda continued talking. \"Do not tell me that. I know you.\" She shook her head. \"Maybe the girl will be willing to say something.\" The Faun looked up sharply in time to see Seda fade away into a silver haze. Then even the haze was gone and the Faun went over to sit by Moanna. If anyone could do anything to help her, he was sure it was Seda. If she deemed Moanna worthy of her help, that is. oOoOo Bringing herself out of the mist Seda looked around where she had ended up. It was large room and it was filled with books. This was the main room of Moanna's mind and it would hold her dreams, memories, hopes, fears and everything that made her who she was. However all the shelves in the room were toppled and books were strewn everywhere. As she looked for Moanna, Seda realized that it must have been a very large dose of poison if it caused this much damage. As she was looking through the rubble Seda couldn't help that all the information in the books she picked up was absorbed into her. She was learning a lot about this Moanna. As she used the vines on her hands to help her pick up some more books she suddenly smiled, she thought she knew why the Faun was so worried about this girl. Now she simply had to locate her… ---------------------------------------- Dr. Blightly was sitting in his office. There was nothing he could do but sit there and wait and it was going to make him go crazy. He was helpless because he had failed to help his patient. As he sat there he wished he knew what was happening to Moanna. Trying to take his mind off the wait he decided to go to the library for something to flip through. As he walked down the hallway he heard raised voices coming from one of the rooms. He stopped when he recognized them and went over to the door. It was open a crack so he peered in. He was right with his suspicions it was Stephan and Bella talking in angry voices to each other. He listened quietly. \"What did you do to Moanna!!?\" Stephan asked Bella angrily. \"What to you mean? What did I do?\" Bella replied, her voice rising. \"You were the one who gave her the poison.\" \"Yes, because….you told me to!\" Stephan protested. \"I did not know it was going to kill her!\" \"It wasn't supposed to, you idiot! It was only supposed to destroy her memory, not her life. I guess I gave you too much.\" She shrugged. \"It does not matter, there is nothing we can do now. Moanna is going to die…\" With that said the room when quiet until Bella spoke up again. \"I wonder who is next in line for the throne once Moanna's gone...Hmm maybe I won't have to marry your brother to get a kingdom after all.\" She chuckled at this and Stephan stared at her. \"We just killed someone and you're wondering if you're next in line for her throne?\" \"She's not dead yet Stephan, so don't worry so much. If you're lucky I might marry you instead of your brother and that way you'll get a kingdom as well.\" Staring at the door Dr. Blightly shook his head angrily. He didn't want to be caught so he made his way back to his room to think. Something had to be done about Bella…. oOoOo Seda was looking through the piles of books when she heard something. After a few moments she was able to locate where the noise was coming from. There was a young woman trying to free herself from a bookshelf that was trapping her. Seda looked down to see the girl look up at her, Her pale face was framed by long brown hair and she looked like she was in great pain. \"Moanna, I presume.\" Seda said calmly as she pulled the bookshelf off Moanna as though she were picking up a twig. \"Where am I?\" Moanna asked gasping as another spasm of pain shot through her. She tried to stand up but she failed and fell to the floor, holding onto her side. Using the vines on her arms Seda pulled Moanna into a sitting position. Looking at her closely she sighed. The legends about the Lady of the Forests were correct in some regards. She didn't like most humans. They always seemed to be trying to destroy something. However this, Moanna had done nothing to warrant her distrust. In fact from what she had learned about Moanna, Seda thought she seemed like someone she could get along with. \"Moanna, Moanna. Can you hear me?\" Seda softly called. Moanna's slowly opened her eyes, wincing slightly. \"Who are you?\" She asked quietly. \"My name is Seda, and I'm here to help you.\" Seda said as felt Moanna's forehead. \"You're trapped inside your mind.\" Another bookshelf fell over some rows away and Moanna reacted as though something had just slashed her shoulder. Grasping it she cringed and asked. \"What's going on?\" \"Your mind is slowly falling apart and in the process it is killing you.\" Moanna stared at her. Seda was in the process of putting some powder in a small brown bag. Once it was filled she tied it tight, shook it then whispered some strange sounds under her breath. She quickly made some complicated looking hand gestures over the bag. Moanna watched as Seda poured the multi-coloured powder into her hand. Seda leaned down so she was level with Moanna and held up her hand with the powder on it and promptly blew the powder in Moanna's face. Coughing Moanna inadvertently inhaled most of the powder. \"What…ahh…did you do that for?\" Moanna choked out. Seda just continued to watch her impassively. After her coughing fit subdued Moanna realized something. \"I don't hurt anymore! Thank-you\" She looked at Seda who waved her hand. \"It was nothing Moanna, I only took away your pain.\" She glanced around the mess they were in. \"You however are still trapped in here.\" \"Do you know how I can get out?\" Moanna asked hopefully. Seda smiled slightly. \"Yes, when I leave I can take you out with me. However if you leave your mind the way it is right now it will be as if you are dead.\" Moanna looked around. \"You mean I have to clean up all of this? That's going to take forever.\" Seda chuckled at the expression on Moanna's face. \"Don't worry Moanna, I can help you.\" Using the vines on her wrists she pulled Moanna up. Moanna just stared in amazement and slowly looked at Seda. \"What…?\" \"I my dear Moanna am the Lady of the Forests. Now why don't we begin?\" Seda began to put the shelves upright. Moanna started on the books but was still watching Seda curiously. ----- While they were cleaning Moanna couldn't help but glance over at Seda. She had read the legends of the Lady of the Forests before and she seemed nothing like them. Seda was supposed to hate humans not go out of her way to help them. \"Did you want to ask me something Moanna?\" Moanna jumped when Seda said this. Seda had her back to her so Moanna was a bit spooked. \"Umm…\" She was about to ask her question but she just realized she wasn't sure what she was supposed to call her. Seda seemed to sense her discomfort. \"You may call me Seda.\" \"Ohh.. thank you…Seda….why are you helping me?\" Seda paused at her work, she had known this question was going to come up sooner or later. \"Yes. I suppose that is a reasonable question.\" She finished with the last book case and turned to face Moanna. \"I certainly make it no secret that I do not like humans….\" She paused for a moment as if considering what to say next. \"…however I was approached by…someone close to me…a sort of family member...if you will. He asked for my help and I agreed to consider giving it.\" She looked at Moanna with a small smile on her face. \"You see when I enter and go through someone's mind I can't help but absorb all the information in it. I know more about you know then you do Moanna.\" Moanna felt a little spooked at Seda's confession but she laughed slightly. \"They way things were going I think that every one knew more about me then I did.\" Seda tilted her head. \"Ahh yes, I trust your memory is back then?\" Moanna turned back to the shelf behind her. \"Yes, yes it is.\" Seda smiled. \"Good….I am sure the Faun will be glad to know that.\" She chuckled as Moanna dropped the book she'd been holding. \"W…What do you mean..?\" Moanna asked stuttering and making a point not to look at Seda. Since she wasn't looking at Seda she missed the mischievous twinkle in her eye. - \"He is your friend, is he not?\" Moanna sighed slightly. \"Ohh... Yes, of course he is. He's my oldest friend.\" - There was a pause then. \"You are in love with him Moanna.\" Moanna froze, and then her shoulders slumped. \"Yes…\" She said quietly. \"Yes I am.\" \"Good.\" Seda replied simply and went back to work. oOoOo Dr. Blightly was looking for Stephan. He was sure that he was the weakest part of the pair. After checking in with the Faun and finding Moanna no better he knew what he had to do. It was dusk now and he had found Stephan in the stable, starring at his sword. He looked up when the doctor walked in he looked slightly panicked then closed his eyes and looked away. \"Hello Stephan.\" Dr. Blightly said as he went over to sit next to him. \"How are you?\" Stephan refused to look at him. They sat in silence for a while before Stephan asked quietly. \"Is... is Moanna…okay?\" The doctor said slightly stiffly. \"She's still not doing well.\" \"But, will she be all right?\" Stephan asked desperately. \"Why are you so concerned? You're the reason she's like this.\" \"I know!\" Stephan buried his face in his hands. \"It wasn't supposed to be like this. She was supposed to fall in love with me and not a Faun…\" He trailed off. \"I was supposed to be a hero and I ended up being the villain.\" He looked over at Dr Blightly. \"I didn't want to hurt Moanna. I was just doing what I was told!\" He looked away. \"I never really wanted to marry her. That was all my brother and Bella's idea.\" Doctor Blightly patted him on the knee. \"Come with me to my office Stephan. We can talk there. There's a couple of things I'd like to ask you.\" The two of them left the stable and walked up in the castle. ----------------- I hope you liked this chapter.

A/N- Again thank you for all the wonderful reviews! You guys are awesome! Read and enjoy!! Also remember to review!! Chapter Eleven - Leaving the Mind Moanna had quickly lost track of the time. For all she knew she could have been in her mind for days. She looked around the room and smiled, they were almost finished. She was surprised by what a hard job it had been, the only advantage had been that the books were not in any real order. Opening the books she'd discovered that they were blank. However she knew instinctively what they were about and was starting to spook her a little bit. \"You know Moanna.\" Seda said suddenly, breaking the silence. \"You interest me.\" Moanna wasn't really sure how to reply to this. \"Ummm…how so?\" Seda turned around to face her. \"I have seen your entire life, I know more about you then your own parents. And yet there is still something that I do not understand.\" \"What is it?\" Moanna was curious. \"When you were little and the Faun found you in the forest. Most children would have been frightened of him. Why were you not?\" Moanna paused and thought about this for a moment. \"I…well I was so scared of the forest at the time I guess. Also….I just felt safer when I was with the Faun…I still do.\" Seda looked at her oddly. \"You know you are the only human I have ever met that would even think that they were safer with a faun.\" That brought a thought into Moanna's head. \"Why don't people like the Faun?\" Seda looked taken aback by the question but after a few seconds she answered simply. \"People will always fear what they don't understand.\" She paused then went on. \"This kingdom is better then most, but people will always look down on magic users or creatures like the Faun because they scare them.\" \"That's stupid.\" Moanna said feeling irritated. Seda laughed. \"You certainly will not be getting an argument from me.\" Moanna just shook her head, still slightly angry. She would never understand the minds of people. She went back to shelving the books, she wished she could see the Faun. oOoOo \"Do you agree to tell the King and Queen what you and Bella have done?\" Dr. Blightly looked sternly at Stephan. They were sitting in the doctors office with the door closed. Stephan looked exasperated. \"If I do tell them Bella will deny everything.\" Dr. Blightly stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"Yes she will most likely do that and she is related to them. They may not believe you.\" \"Besides.\" Stephan said frantically. \"You said yourself she may not die. If she doesn't why do we have to say anything?\" \"Because Prince Stephan.\" Dr. Blightly said emphasizing the word Prince. \"Even if Moanna does not die you and Bella have committed the crime of attempted murder. Not much of a brave prince charming you turned out to be.\" Stephan buried his face in his hands. \"I know.\" He said rather irritably. \"I Know.\" The room was silent for a while. - Then Stephan spoke up again. \"I really didn't want Moanna to get hurt.\" Dr. Blightly rolled his eyes. \"You have said this many times Stephan. I know ! You were however at fault. You should have done something! Moanna may die; just because you and Bella thought you'd make a better husband for her then…..anyone else.\" Stephan laughed bitterly. \"You don't have to coat things for me doctor. I'm well aware that Moanna felt more for that…faun then she would ever would about me.\" Dr. Blightly looked over at Stephan with his eyes raised. \"Can you blame her?\" The room was silent again and Stephan looked away. \"I'll tell them….\" oOoOo Looking around the room Moanna sighed with relief. \"We're finished.\" \"Yes, it appears we are.\" Seda said with satisfaction. \"You are a very complicated person Moanna. It would not take nearly so long to clean most human minds.\" \"Ohh.\" Moanna looked away. \"Sorry.\" \"No my dear, that's a good thing. It means you are not so narrow minded as most other humans.\" \"…thank you, I guess.\" Seda stretched her arms. \"Well I do believe we are done here Moanna. Are you ready to leave?\" \"Yes!\" Moanna said eagerly. Then a thought struck her and she looked suddenly at Seda. \"Will I be able to remember everything when I'm sent back?\" Seda looked at her seriously. \"I need to talk to you before we leave Moanna.\" She held up her hands when Moanna was about to speak. \"Yes it is related to your memories.\" She looked over at Moanna. \"Have a seat.\" She pointed over to the room's corner. Moanna looked over these in surprise, she'd never noticed the chairs before. She walked over slowly wondering what Seda wanted to talk about because the lady looked very serious. - \"Now Moanna.\" Seda said once they had sat down. \"I've been inside your mind with you for about a day now.\" \"A day!\" Moanna exclaimed then quieted when Seda looked sharply at her. \"Sorry…\" \"As I was saying...\" Seda said again a little stiffly. \"I do not wish to sound rude but do you have any idea what you are about to get yourself into?\" Moanna looked at her slightly confused. \"What do you mean?\" Seda sighed. \"I mean…\" She trailed off. \"I will not stand by and watch anything bad happen to the Faun. I know you are really in love with him and knowing the Faun as long as I have I know he is in love with you…however the problem lies with the fact that very few people will like the fact that their princess loves a Faun.\" \"I don't care what people think.\" Moanna protested indigently. Seda smiled bitterly. \"I know you don't Moanna. That is hardly the problem. What is a problem is that like it or not you are going to be a Queen and a Queen has to respect the wishes of her people.\" Moanna just sat there then burst out. \"Well maybe I won't be Queen then!\" Seda looked at her seriously but didn't respond to Moanna's outburst. \"Moanna, as I have said before I do not like humans. However I am willing to erase your memories permanently if you so wish.\" \"What?\" Moanna asked startled. \"Why would I want you to do that?\" \"Because Moanna. If you forget about the Faun then you will be able to live a normal life. Something that you would not be able to have if you still remembered the Faun.\" She looked away. \"The Faun would probably not be pleased that I am offering you this choice but know that he wants you to be happy and if you think you would be happier without him in your life I am sure he would leave. So choose wisely Moanna because I will only offer this once.\" Moanna stared at her hands. It wasn't true that she had never stopped to think about what was going to happen after she got out of her mind. However she had never considered a possibility that the Faun wasn't present in. What would it be like if she truly forgot everything, with no chance to remember the Faun? She'd marry some Prince of some land or another noble. After when her parents stepped down she'd become Queen. She'd be loved by everyone….but she would lose the Faun. Just then the reality of this simple statement struck her. Not only would she lose the love of her life but a close friend as well. There would be no more stories, no more talks…she wouldn't even remember him. Even just thinking about this brought on a horrible feeling of sadness and she knew. \"No.\" \"What did you say Moanna?\" Seda said when Moanna had broken the silence. \"I said no.\" Moanna replied, her face as rigid as metal. \"I do not want you to erase my memory. I would rather give up my right to the crown then to lose the Faun.\" Seda smiled. \"That is what I hoped you would say.\" She stood up and pressed her palms together. \"Now we shall leave.\" She closed her eyes and began to chant. - After a few moments Seda started to fade. Opening her eyes before she disappeared she looked confused and Moanna realized that something must have gone wrong. She was supposed to be taking her out as well but nothing was happening. Yes, something was very wrong. As the last of Seda disappeared Moanna realized that once again she was in intense pain. As she fell to the floor clutching her head she remembered being grateful that the shelves at least weren't falling over. However, after that thought she was lost in her pain. oOoOo Seda appeared in front of the Faun giving him a fright. \"Is she awake?\" Seda asked worried as the Faun looked up. \"No, she is still the same.\" Seda shook her head. \"She should be awake by now. I just do not understand.\" Just then she froze and hit her head. \"Oh of course.\" She stretched out her arms said something quickly and soon she was gone, leaving a puff of silver smoke. The Faun shook his head and looked over at Dr. Blightly and Stephan who were standing in the doorway staring in amazement. \"She always did like theatrics.\" He said before turning his attention back to Moanna. He had no idea what Seda planned to do but he very much wanted something to work. He wasn't sure what he would do if Moanna died. So he dismissed these thoughts and went back to listening to Dr. Blightly talk and waited. oOoOo Appearing much quicker then she had the first time Seda lost her balance when she arrived in Moanna's mind. Quickly the vines on her wrist shot out to steady herself and she managed to avoid hitting the floor by inches. Seda was glad of this small fortune but when she got to her feet she realized something was wrong. The room was ice cold, and there was a horrible, strange sensation seeping through it. She also noticed, with growing dread that Moanna was no where to be seen. Fear went through her. Was she too late? How was she going to ever be able to look at the Faun again, if Moanna was dead? Just then she heard a sharp intake of breath coming from the other side of the room. She walked over quickly and discovered Moanna on the floor shaking. Looking around the room Seda noticed something that she hadn't when she entered. The room looked like it was starting to fade and turning back she realized with a jolt that Moanna was as well. Seda swore in her native tongue, Moanna was dieing and quickly. She had forgotten that the powder she had given Moanna would fail to be effective after she left the mind. It should have made her better though, the poison must have been stronger then she thought. She looked at Moanna seriously. She had limited options at the moment and none of them were very good. She grabbed Moanna with her vines and held her still with them. Using her hands she reached into her robes, she faltered for just a moment then looked again at Moanna. Her eyes were diluted and she was losing colour and she wasn't responding. Seeing this Seda made up her mind, she drew a dagger out of her sash. Using her vines she held Moanna up and cut her palm with the dagger. Moanna winced while Seda used the dagger to cut her own palm. She grabbed Moanna's cut hand with her own and began to chant. A blue haze started to envelop the both of them and a wind came through the room. After a few minutes the wind died down and Seda stopped chanting. As she drew back her hand the cut healed instantly and she watched as Moanna's eyes slowly started to focus. - \"What…what happened?\" Moanna asked as she tried to clear her eyes. She looked down at her arms which were still being held by Seda's vines. Seda let Moanna's arms go and helped her to her feet. \"Are you all right Moanna?\" \"I think so….\" Moanna said trying to keep her balance. \"The last thing I remember is a horrible pain but now all that hurts is my hand…\" She trailed off and looked at her palm. To her surprise there was a cut on her hand, that wasn't the surprising part though. She had expected there was a cut because of the pain. What was surprising her however was that the cut was slowly closing by itself. \"What…..\" She stared at her hand then back up at Seda. Seda looked rather uncomfortable. \"Seda, what happened?\" She winced as a quick burst of pain shot through her and she grabbed both sides of her head. However it had soon passed and Moanna noticed that Seda was looking guilty. \"Moanna, you were dieing.\" Seda said simply, looking her straight in the eyes. \"I had few options and I chose the one I thought was best….\" At this however she trailed off. \"I am not sure if you will like the outcome though….You are alive Moanna and very soon you will be healed from the poison and out of your mind.\" \"Really?\" Moanna smiled. That was just what she wanted to hear, however it looked like Seda still had a lot to say. \"Moanna. You will be able to leave and you will be able to leave. However you will not be quite the same as when you came in.\" Moanna looked at her curiously. \"You mean I'll have my memories back?\" \"That's not quite what I meant Moanna. As I had said before I only had a few options. I couldn't risk giving you any of the powder like I had before to end your pain as it would have killed you even quicker. I had to give you something that would allow you to heal yourself. So I gave you some of my blood and with it some of my power. Moanna looked up sharply from staring at her hand. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that along with my blood you received some of my power. You are no longer fully human. You will have some magic, though I do not know yet how much.\" Moanna was just staring at Seda. \"What do you mean...?\" Seda sighed \"Just what I said…\" She trailed off as the two of them started to fade and before Seda could say anything they were gone. --- --- Dr. Blightly looked up from talking to the Faun and Stephan. \"What in blazes is happening?\" Moanna was surrounded by blue mist and then she began to rise slowly in the air. She hovered for a few moments then fell back down on the bed. The Faun had been watching her intently. He wasn't really listening to Stephan and Dr.Blightly. He was watching Moanna throughout what had happened and he had a growing suspicion on what was happening. Just then Seda appeared in the middle of the room. She didn't say anything to anyone in the room and rushed over to see Moanna. She looked her over closely and then sighed in relief. \"She is going to be alright.\" She said turning back to face the people in the room. \"That's wonderful!\" Dr. Blightly smiled. The Faun looked over at Seda suspiciously. \"Why is she not awake yet?\" \"Her body is very tired and she is merely asleep.\" Seda said simply. \"She will be awake in an hour or two.\" The Faun paused and looked at Seda. He noticed she looked like she wasn't saying something. Seda must have noticed the odd looks he was giving her. \"Can I speak to you in the hallway?\" The Faun nodded and followed Seda to the door. He made sure that Dr. Blightly was still in the room because he didn't trust Stephan with Moanna alone. Once he was in the hallway he turned to Seda and said simply. \"What happened?\" \"She was dieing and I did what I had to do to save her.\" Seda said. \"When I first got there I was able to halt the symptoms long enough to re-organize her mind. However when I attempted to get Moanna out the first time I forgot that leaving would bring back her symptoms. When I returned I realized that poison was back in effect.\" She paused and looked away from the Faun. \"I gave her some of my blood and helped her to heal herself.\" The Faun looked at her sharply. \"You…what?\" -- Just then there was a high pitch scream from the room. Seda and the Faun rushed in to see…Stephan pointing at Moanna. \"What is it Stephan?\" Dr. Blightly asked, concern evident in his voice. \"It's….it's Moanna…look at her!\" Moanna however looked very much the same as she always had. Dr. Blightly rolled his eyes. \"Be quiet Stephan. You may wake her up.\" But Stephan wasn't listening he walked closer to Moanna and pointed at her head. \"Look at her ears…they're pointed!\" Looking closely you could see that Moanna's ears were a little pointed. The Faun looked over at Seda. Seda smiled slightly. \"Well…at least I can honestly say that I don't like any humans.\" - Everyone in the room just looked at her. Stephan broke the silence looking at Seda in utter shock. \"What…what do you mean? What did you do to her?\" His voice was getting louder and louder. Dr. Blightly kept shushing him. After a few minutes he managed to succeed and after he looked at Seda intently. \"What exactly did you do to Moanna?\" Seda's voice seemed to get colder. \"What I did doctor is what you seemed incapable of doing. I helped her.\" She glared at the Doctor till the Faun placed a hand on her shoulder. \"Fine…\" Seda started again, this time her voice wasn't so hostile. \"I gave her some of my power. Which, means she isn't fully human anymore. She's part dryad…\" She glared at Stephan who was about to start speaking. \"She's not fully a tree spirit that's impossible. The only thing that has changed about her is her ears and that she can heal herself quicker then most humans. That's all that should have changed…\" She trialed off as though she was thinking of something else to say but then changed her mind. \"She'll be awake in a few hours and I suggest we let her sleep.\" She went over to sit on the floor. \"You're staying here?\" Stephan asked, earning himself a glare from Seda and he backed away little. \"I mean…\" \"I know what you mean.\" Seda interrupted as she settled herself on the ground. \"I helped Moanna so I intend to stay around and make sure that my work has not gone to waste.\" She closed her eyes and steeped her fingers and began softly humming. Dr. Blightly looked over at the Faun. \"She is contacting her other forests.\" He replied. Dr. Blightly decided it was best to stay silent. oOoOo After an hour of waiting Seda was still deep in silent conversation with one of her distant forests. Dr. Blightly had removed Stephan from the room as they needed to go over what they were going to tell the King and Queen. So only the Faun was waiting for Moanna to wake up. He looked over at Seda in the corner of the room. He was slightly suspicious about what Seda had said about Moanna. He looked closely at Moanna, he wasn't sure that the only things she would have gotten from Seda's power was the ability to heal herself. With a power transfer such as that you could never tell. He was thinking this over deeply when he heard a quiet voice. \"Hello.\" He looked down to see Moanna sitting up and smiling at him. --- --- -- -- Hope you liked the chapter. Don't worry, it's not the end. Not by the half of it…. (Whatever the heck that means). Anyway we'll be finding out what Bella's been up to in the next chapter. Knowing her it's nothing good. Please leave a review and tell what you thought of it! And a Happy New Year!![Chapter 12] Disclaimer- Against all odds I still I still do not own Pan's Labyrinth! A/N- Thank you for the reviews they're really inspiring! I just realized how long it took me to get this chapter out. For that I can only say…very very sorry!! I have exams coming up soon, all I can say. Yea Moanna is awake….finally! Please read, review and enjoy! Chapter Twelve: Awake Moanna almost laughed at the surprised expression on the Faun's face. Very slowly he leaned forewords and touched her check with one of his long fingers as if to make sure that Moanna was really there. \"Moanna…\" He said quietly. \"You're awake….\" He trailed off and before he could say anything else Moanna leaned forwards and hugged him. \"I missed you.\" Moanna said as tears pricked her eyes. The Faun patted her gently on the back. \"I did too Moanna.\" Moanna leaned back and quickly wiped her eyes. She couldn't believe she was seeing the Faun again. She was so happy to be back, even though she hadn't really gone anywhere in the first place…. She heard some one else in the room and looked over to see Seda getting up of the floor. \"Hello Moanna.\" Seda said as she walked over. \"I must say I am certainly glad that you are awake now. I was worried for a moment that you might not have made it.\" She smiled innocently when the Faun looked over at her. Moanna guessed Seda hadn't shared her fears with him. Just then there was a knock on the door. They looked over to see the King and Queen standing in the door with Dr. Blightly. \"Oh, Moanna!\" The Queen went quickly over to hug her daughter. There were tears in the corner of her eyes. \"How are you my dear?\" \"I'm fine mother.\" Moanna smiled as she looked at her. \"How is the baby?\" The Queen smiled more and even the King looked like he had tears in his eyes. It had been so long since Moanna had asked about the baby. It was clear to them that she was back to normal. Now if they only knew who had tried to kill her in the first place. oOoOo Dr. Blightly had left Stephan alone in his office when the King and Queen came in. They went up to see if Moanna was any better. Stephan had decided to stay behind because…because well, he wasn't sure if he wanted to be there if Moanna wasn't better. He realized he'd been stupid to follow through with Bella's plans but a part of him did wish that Moanna had wanted to marry him. If she had then nothing like this would have happened in the first place. Sighing he realized that no matter what he did it was not going to be pleasant for him. \"Well, well. What have we here?\" A mocking voice drifted from the doorway. Stephan turned to see Bella leaning against the doorframe. \"Hello Bella.\" Stephan replied calmly, while bitterly cursing his luck. \"I suppose you've heard the news.\" Bella smiled bitterly as she walked into the room. \"Moanna is awake now.\" Stephan just nodded his head amiably all the while staring at his boot. He hadn't, but wasn't going to say anything. When the room drifted into silence he still didn't look up. He didn't want to meet Bella's eyes because he was sure that if he did she would know he'd confessed. He wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As the silence seemed to grow longer still, Stephan thought Bella might have left the room. After what seemed like ages he slowly lifted his head up. Just as he was at eye contact with the door there was a voice at his ear. \"I know what you did.\" A simple statement but the shock of it made Stephan jump. He turned to find Bella standing behind him with a particularly nasty look in her eye. \"What…do you mean Bella?\" He feigned innocence knowing very well that it was going to fail. Bella laughed as she moved to face him. Her laugh was bitter and false much like the smile on her face. \"Stephan, you happen to be a very bad liar so I would very much appreciate if we would just get to the point.\" Stephan gulped. \"Yes, well….what is the point?\" \"You turned us in Stephan. I know all about how you told that wretched doctor.\" She flicked Stephan on the head. \"Do you honestly think that just because you confess they'll go easy on you? Please\" She laughed again. \"If I go down, you are going down too.\" She paused to let this all sink in. \"Though if you do exactly as I say Stephan. We can get out of this mess. Without having to be caught.\" She smirked and Stephan replied quietly. \"And if I refuse?\" \"I'll make sure that you are the only one blamed for the attempt on poor Moanna's life. And believe me, I can and I will.\" \"Very well,\" sighed Stephan as he got up. \"What must I do?\" Bella twirled her hair around one of her fingers as she replied. \"Listen closely to me because I will only say this once. I have taken the liberty of sending a message to your brother.\" \"What?\" oOoOo After a couple of days Moanna was allowed to get out of bed. She would have been able to get up earlier then that but her parents were very worried about the state of her health. They made sure that Moanna had a guard with her at all times, just in case whoever had tried to kill her, tried again. All this fuss was very irritating to Moanna. At the moment she was sitting on her bed talking to Seda and trying very much to ignore the armed guard in the corner of the room. He wasn't particularly frightening as he seemed to be afraid of Seda. Moanna really couldn't blame him though as Seda did have a habit of glaring at all humans that crossed her path. She thought it was funny that Seda didn't seem to hate her but then she realized with a jolt that she wasn't really human anymore. It was a hard thought to wrap your head around so Moanna was just trying not to think of it. It didn't help then that Seda was doing her best to steer the conversation in that direction. \"You should have told them already Moanna.\" Seda said calmly. \"I didn't want to worry them.\" She replied looking away. \"There's nothing I can do, so I'll have to tell them eventually but I just want to tell them when I know they're ready. They're too busy trying to hunt down the people who poisoned me anyway.\" Moanna rolled her eyes as she looked back at Seda. \"We know who did it, can't we just tell them?\" \"I wish it was that easy.\" Seda answered calmly, however she knew Moanna was just trying to change the subject as they had already discussed this topic with the doctor and the Faun before. She smirked, well if Moanna wanted to change topics then why didn't she switch it to something that she was interested in hearing? \"Oh, Moanna. I do know for certain that you are not going to be marrying that prince. Have you given any thought to what you plan to do now?\" \"What do you mean?\" Moanna asked nervously twisting the hem of her dress. She looked off in the other direction, hoping that Seda would get the hint. However Seda showed no inclination in stopping. \"What do you think I mean?\" Seda asked innocently. The room faded into silence and stayed as such for a short while before Moanna replied. \"I know what you mean Seda…\" She started then trailed off. She took a deep breath then started up again. \"I don't think that now is really…the right time.\" \"Nonsense. There's no time like the present. I think you should go talk to him soon Moanna.\" Moanna looked over at Seda suspiciously. Her cheerful tone had vanished in the last sentence and Seda seemed quite serious. Moanna however wasn't so sure of what she should do. She hadn't been able to say anything to the Faun even though she had been awake for the last three days. \"I can not Seda.\" Moanna looked over at the guard. \"You know I am not allowed to leave this room without a guard.\" \"Ah yes.\" Seda said thoughtfully. \"Well I am sure that I can think of something.\" -- -- -- -- --- \"I do not see why you are asking me.\" Dr. Blightly looked over warily at Seda from his desk. \"The decision can only be made by the King and Queen.\" Seda frowned slightly, tapping her foot impatiently. Humans irritated her. \"I am well aware of that, doctor. However I do not think that they will in-trust their daughter with me.\" Dr. Blightly looked at Seda standing tall and defiant in front of him. He wasn't sure why she seemed to hate humans so much but seeing the way that people treated the Faun he could hazard a guess. He folded the papers he'd been writing on and got up from his chair. \"I will ask them for you then my lady.\" He bowed his head slightly before leaving the room. As he left he noticed the surprised expression on Seda's face before it returned to its original composure. He went to look for the Queen. -- -- In her room the Queen was working on her embroidery while listening to her niece talk. She was just wondering if it would sound rude if she asked how much longer Bella's visit was going to last. The girl had been here for the past month or two. They were however talking about who Moanna might marry. The Queen was glad that Bella had realized that Moanna was not going to be marrying Stephan. \"Well, my brothers only eight but they could be betrothed. I know they're cousins but it has been done before.\" Bella was saying looking closely at the Queen. \"Perhaps.\" The Queen smiled gently as Bella went on. \"It would be a good match. Though if Moanna doesn't wish to marry her cousin I could help you find another suitor for her.\" The Queen responded absently. \"I am starting to think that it would be for the best if we waited for the time being. Moanna is going through a lot right now.\" She examined a thread closely before going on. \"Yes, I think we will put off marriage negotiations for the time being. At least till we have found the poisoner and I have had my child.\" She absentmindedly patted her stomach. Bella looked at her, smiling innocently. \"How long till you have the baby?\" \"At least four more months.\" Moanna gritted her teeth. She was running out of ideas. Actually she had run out of ideas a while ago. Without Stephan married to Moanna there was no chance that she would marry his brother and she still hadn't heard back from him. Maybe it was time to give up and find herself another powerful prince to marry. One that didn't have her stuck pretending that she enjoyed talking to her horrid cousin. Yes it would be nice to get away from her. \"That's wonderful.\" Bella said shortly. \"I hope that when I have returned home you will send me news of its birth.\" The Queen smiled, an opportunity had presented itself. \"When do you plan to return home Bella?\" \"Oh, very soon your majesty. I love spending time with Moanna but I simply must return to my home soon.\" She giggled lightly. \"My own suitors will be wondering what happened to me.\" At that moment there was a knock on the door. The Queen called for the person to enter. Dr. Blightly came in, frowning slightly when he noticed Bella. \"Your majesty, if I may have a word with you?\" Bella got up quickly. \"Well I should go and send word to my mother if I am to be returning home soon. May I borrow one of your messengers, your majesty?\" \"Oh course my dear.\" The Queen smiled. \"Send my greetings to your parents as well.\" Bella gave a little curtsy and walked out of the room. The Queen looked over at Dr. Blightly and motioned for him to sit. \"Now what is that you wished to talk to me about?\" The Queen asked once the doctor was seated. \"It is about Moanna your majesty.\" Dr. Blightly began. \"Is she all right?\" The Queen cut him off quickly. \"Yes, yes. She's made a complete recovery. There are no lingering side effects to the poison.\" The Queen sighed. \"I was however wondering if Moanna was allowed to go out for a walk without the guards.\" He went on quickly as he saw the Queen frown slightly. \"Not that she would be alone, mind you. Just that she was accompanied by say…Seda?\" The Queen frowned slightly. \"Seda? Who is Seda?\" Inwardly the doctor kicked himself. He had forgotten that the King and Queen did not know Seda's name. \"The Lady of the Forests.\" The Queen looked surprised at this and the room went silent for a moment as she thought things over. -- \"Well.\" The Queen said thoughtfully. \"I suppose that if someone else were with them….\" She trailed off, thought a moment more then smiled. \"Very well, I will allow Moanna to go walking with Seda on one condition. You must go with them doctor.\" Dr. Blightly fought the urge to groan. Instead he bowed his head slightly. \"As you wish your majesty. I will go tell your daughter the news.\" He got up quickly and went out of the room. oOoOo Moanna was walking around the castle. Every where she went the guard followed behind her. She rolled her eyes as she passed the tapestry on the third floor. She would have liked to go in there but she didn't want anyone to know where her hiding spot was. So she walked by. Walking down to the second floor she passed by Bella's room. She suddenly stopped walking when she realized what her cousin was doing. She was packing. Moanna quickly went back to Bella's room and knocked on the door. She had no wish to talk to Bella but she needed to know if she was leaving. \"Yes. Oh hello Moanna\" Bella said looking up from the bed. \"What a pleasant surprise.\" She said nothing about the guard that had followed Moanna into the room. \"Are you leaving Bella?\" Moanna asked innocently. \"Yes, I thought it was time I was getting home. I mean my mother must be worried about me by now.\" She folded a dress and the room lapsed into silence. Moanna frowned, really what did you say to someone who tried to kill you? Have a nice trip seemed didn't seem like the sort of thing you said to your would be killer. At this thought Moanna blinked. If Bella was leaving then that meant that they might never be able to prove that she'd tried to kill her. It also meant she may have a guard follow her around for the rest of her life. Bella must have noticed her stillness and she smirked. \"Well I will be sure to send you word of my safe arrival.\" \"When are you leaving Bella?\" \"Oh tonight.\" Moanna said a quick goodbye and walked out of the room towards her own. -- She was just walking in when she heard a loud voice. She motioned for the guard to stand by the door. Something he did, smiling at Moanna gratefully. Moanna realized why when she recognized the voice, it was Seda. She walked in to find Seda talking just bellow a shouting level. Dr. Blightly was standing in front of her, looking slightly intimidated. \"Why do you think, human?\" Seda was saying, spitting out the word human with such venom. \"Are you really blind to the horrors human kind has inflicted on things?\" Moanna had never seen Seda this angry before. Her face was frightening it was so enraged and the vines on her arms looked like snakes ready to strike. \"What happened?\" Moanna breathed. \"Well Dr. Blightly made a rather unfortunate decision in asking Seda why she does not like humans\" Moanna looked up and saw the Faun looking down at her. Moanna was slightly taken aback as she hadn't realized the Faun had been standing there. His face however, betrayed no emotion at all. Seda seemed to realize that they had an audience and stopped talking. She looked over at the Faun and Moanna. The rage seemed to slowly disappear from her face but it was clear that she was still irritated. She walked away from the doctor and turned to Moanna. Her face was stony. \"You are telling your parents now Moanna.\" Moanna blinked. \"What am I telling them?\" Seda opened her mouth but before she could say anything the Faun interrupted. \"You said you wished to talk to me Seda?\" Seda turned to face him. \"I did.\" - Moanna walked over to Dr. Blightly who was still looking a little stunned. He got himself together and smiled at Moanna. \"Hello Moanna.\" \"You asked Seda why she doesn't like humans?\" Moanna asked instead of a greeting. \"Yes, well I see now that it was rather foolish of me to do so.\" Dr. Blightly replied slightly embarrassed. Moanna nodded in agreement. - They watched the Faun and Seda talking in a different language for a while before Moanna remembered something. \"Bella is leaving tonight.\" \"Where is she going?\" Dr. Blightly asked, shocked. \"She's going home. Well that's where she said she's going. Even if she is, what are we going to tell my parents?\" Dr. Blightly pinched the bridge of his nose in thought. \"Well, we could tell them what we know before Bella leaves, but-\" \"-but we don't have any proof.\" Moanna finished his sentence. \"Correct.\" They went silent. The only sound was Seda talking quickly in an unknown language. Moanna sighed and Dr. Blightly voiced what seemed to be on both their minds. \"Just how many languages does the Faun know?\" -- After a while Moanna was asking Dr. Blightly for advice on when to tell her parents about her not being fully human. However everyone was interrupted when the guard stuck his head in the room and cleared his throat. \"Excuse me. Princess Moanna you are requested downstairs.\" The room was silent as Moanna replied. \"…Very well.\" She walked over to the door, with the doctor following her. Seda had gone back to talking quickly with the Faun and Moanna gave him small smile before leaving. Seda was starting to sound annoyed at the Faun and Moanna was wondering if she was simply in a bad mood. She followed the guard out of the room and down to the front of the castle where her mother and father were standing. She was wondering what they wanted her for when she noticed that there was a man standing next to them. He looked slightly familiar and with a jolt she realized he looked like Stephan. \"Hello Moanna.\" The man greeted with a dramatic bow. \"Allow me to introduce my self. My name is High Prince Gregory.\" He was fairly tall and had the same blond hair his brother did. However he also had a small beard and had an air of vanity around him that Stephan didn't. There was a pause before Moanna realized that she was supposed to be polite. \"It is very nice to meet you.\" She curtsied, attempting a smile. Gregory turned to face the King and Queen. \"As I was saying your majesties I came as soon as my brother sent word. For you see.\" He paused for dramatic effect. \"I have found the person who tried to kill your daughter!\" The room went silent and Moanna and Dr. Blightly were looking at each other confused. \"What do you mean?\" The King asked. \"My men and I were riding over here when we found a dead body lying on the side of the road. Upon further examination we found that the man had written a suicide note. He poisoned himself as he was sure that he was going to be arrested for trying to murder the lovely princess Moanna.\" \"Did he mention in this note if he had accomplices?\" \"He did not. Moanna should be safe now!\" Gregory looked very pleased with himself. \"It was very kind of you to put our minds at ease like this.\" The Queen said, smiling. Glad her daughter seemed at last out of harms way. \"It was nothing.\" Gregory bowed again to the King and Queen. He walked over to Moanna. \"I am happy to have gotten the chance to help so fair a maiden in her times of trouble.\" He grasped Moanna by the hand and kissed it. Forcing Moanna to resist snatching her hand back and whipping it on her dress. Gregory didn't seem to notice this and continued talking. Dr. Blightly however rolled his eyes. He knew now where Stephan got all his idiotic actions from. Gregory turned to face the King and Queen. He smiled and said, \"I would just like to take this moment to ask your majesties for one small favor.\" \"What is it?\" The Queen responded still smiling at the news. \"I would like the opportunity to be Moanna's suitor.\" - Moanna looked at Dr. Blightly and almost screamed. --- -- duh ..duh ..duh…. can anyone say cliff hanger? I hope you liked the chapter! It took me ages to find a good name for Gregory. His name means watchful in case you were wondering. Also, before anyone asks. He is a High Prince which means he's the heir to his country's throne. Stephan is only a prince because he isn't first inline. Really I have no idea where I got that from but it sounded good and I kept it. Please leave a review and tell me what you thought and again sorry for the wait. Just a heads up, I don't think I'll have another one out till at least after my exams. I'll try though![Chapter 13] Disclaimer - I do not own Pan's Labyrinth therefore, \" You will not sue me…also these aren't the droids you're looking for \" ( wave's hand) A/N- Sorry for the wait but….Exams are over!! (Does happy dance) ... I'm fine…really. (Looks around shifty eyed ) Again thank you for reviewing. You guys are the best inspiration! Well please read, review and enjoy! Chapter Thirteen: Hide and Seek Moanna stared from where she was standing. Her face was stiff with shock and she didn't hear anything that was going on around her. Very slowly so no one would notice her, she started to move backwards. Dr. Blightly noticed this but didn't say anything. He was listening to Gregory chatter on and was sad to see that Moanna's parents seemed happy to hear of the proposal. He'd been hoping that they would have realized that their daughter had no interest in marrying a prince, even if he was a high prince. He did however watch in amusement when everyone noticed that Moanna wasn't there anymore. \"Where is my daughter?\" The Queen asked looking around, very confused. \"I will go and look for her, your majesty.\" Gregory said, with an elegant bow. He was stopped however when one of his attendants pulled him aside and whispered something in his ear. Dr. Blightly's professional eye noticed that the man seemed to be limping slightly. \"Ah well maybe we should let the young maiden be alone for a while.\" Gregory said straightening himself up.\" \"Yes.\" The Queen sighed, \"She just needs some time alone.\" \"Well.\" The King smiled. \"If you are to be staying here let us show you to your room.\" \"Thank you your majesty.\" Gregory bowed yet again. \"Lead the way.\" Dr. Blightly watched as everyone left the hall. He wasn't sure what was going on but he was sure that the arrival of this high prince was not good news. He sighed and decided that he had better go upstairs and inform the Faun and Seda of the news. Something he was not looking forward to in the slightest. oOoOo Bella was not happy, not happy at all. When she had heard about Gregory's intentions to marry Moanna she almost screamed but in the end she settled for flinging an embroidered pillow at Stephan's head. She had also sent a message sent with one of Gregory's attendants and when the young man politely suggested that Gregory might not agree to meet her, she kicked him in the shins, hard. A most undignified action for a princess but no one seemed likely to lecture her in the foul mood she was in. As it happened Stephan had fled the room after the pillow had been thrown at him as he noticed that there were still plenty of things to throw left in the room. Ones that would cause much more damage then a pillow would. As he was gone Bella was alone in the room fuming. After a short while there was a knock on the door and before Bella could say anything the person entered. \"I received your message my dear but was it really necessary to injure my attendant? He'll be limping for quite a while.\" \"Don't you my dear me!\" Bella said, jumping up from her seat. \"How dare you. I've been stuck in this bloody kingdom for months now just so we could get married and then you show up and announce you want to marry Moanna.\" \"Yes, well. Plans change my dear.\" Gregory said without looking a bit apologetic while flicking away dust from his sleeve. \"You failed anyway, the only way I was going to marry you was if you made sure my brother married Moanna. Since that seemed to be impossible now, I stepped in.\" He looked over at Bella, who was still glaring at him. \"And you can stop your act Bella, I am quite aware that you only wished to marry me for power. Ironically that's the same reason I hope to marry your cousin.\" He smirked at Bella's outraged expression. \"It sounds so ugly does it not, when the shoe is on the other foot?\" Bella paused until the silence in the room built up. \"Very well, I am through with you Gregory.\" She spat out his name. \"I was planning on leaving tonight and I have no intentions on changing my plans, especially now you are here.\" She made to leave the room but as she was about halfway to the door and he hadn't said anything she turned to face him. A thought had struck her, a particularly amusing one. \"You would have been better off marrying me, you know.\" She watched as he looked at her indifferently. \"And why Bella, would that have been?\" \"Because, I am not all ready in love with someone.\" With that statement Bella left the room. Happy that she'd been able to mess with his head one last time. Gregory on the other hand wasn't in the least bit worried; he knew Moanna would marry him. It didn't matter if she was in love. Love had no place in marriage, well for nobles anyway. He smirked again. Yes who ever Moanna was in love with had better watch out because now that he was here Moanna would be his. He strode out of the room feeling as though everything was falling into place. oOoOo Moanna was starting to wonder if she was cursed. It certainly seemed that her life seemed far too complicated at some points. Now certainty being one of them. She sat there in the library in one of the more comfortable chairs and thought. She was disturbed slightly when she heard her cousin's voice. Looking up she saw Bella standing in front of her, this wasn't particularly surprising as Bella did have a rather annoying habit of popping up out of nowhere. The strange thing about this time was that she didn't have a fake smile plastered on her face. No, this time she was tightlipped and Moanna could see a gleam in her eye that looked like she was angry. This put her on her guard quickly enough. \"Hello Bella.\" Moanna said carefully. Looking over her cousin with a wary eye. \"Did you want to speak to me?\" There was a pause and Moanna was about to say something when Bella spoke up. There was a defiant look in her eye. \"Moanna….I hate you!\" She smiled now, though this smile was filled with satisfaction. \"There, I thought since I am leaving now I would get a chance to say that.\" Moanna just looked on at her in amazement. Then she started to laugh. Bella looked at her oddly. \"What's so funny?\" \"You!\" Moanna gasped. \"YOU hate ME? I should be the one that hates you. After all you put me through.\" \"Yes, yes.\" Bella rolled her eyes. \"We all know how saintly you, could never hate anyone. I don't have that problem.\" Moanna sat up straighter. \"Was that all you came to tell me?\" \"Not quite.\" There was a pause. \"I don't want you to get the wrong meaning from this Moanna. I do not like you and the only reason I am giving you this warning is because I hate him more.\" Moanna looked interested at this comment. \"Watch out for Gregory, Moanna. He may be Stephan's brother but he's worse then Stephan could ever be.\" \"And yet you wanted to marry him?\" Bella shrugged. \"I want power. With my own brothers ahead of me for my country's throne there is no hope I will ever rule there.\" Something struck Moanna then. \"But aren't your brothers younger then you?\" Bella frowned. \"They are, but as they are male it puts them ahead of me inline. As it is then, I am going home where I will find some other wealthy high prince.\" With the normal condescending smirk back on her face she walked out of the library. Moanna just watched in astonishment as Bella waved to her before she left the room. She put her head in her hands. Bella had tried to kill her and she felt no guilt about it at all. Moanna sighed. She was glad that Bella was leaving at last. Maybe it didn't matter that they would not be able to prove Bella had tried to kill her. If she really was going home then Moanna doubted she'd try to kill her again. A small smile appeared on Moanna's face. Maybe she would write her cousin a letter telling her that she did hate her. That would make her realize she wasn't that she saintly. However as cheerful as she was with this thought she realized what was still facing her. Gregory was still here and if Bella thought him trouble, Moanna was sure that he was. - Just then, as though he knew he was being thought about Gregory showed up in the door of the library. He had an attendant following him still. Moanna rolled her eyes at this display of power. Unlike most rulers her parents didn't have very many servants in the castle. Most of the people who worked in the castle lived in the town below and only were around when needed. \"Hello Moanna.\" Gregory smiled, elegantly. \"Will you allow me the honor of escorting you to dinner?\" He held out his hand to her, which she stared at. There was a pause in the room as Gregory kept his hand extended. Moanna took a quick glance over at his attendant but his face was as unreadable as a stone. She looked back at Gregory who was still smiling and she wondered vaguely if this was where Stephan had learned to hold a false looking smile. She sighed, she was hungry and it seemed that the only way that she was going to get anything to eat was if she walked down with Gregory. \"Very well.\" She walked deliberately by Gregory's outstretched hand. She noticed the attendants amused look that quickly turned blank when Gregory looked over at him. The high prince however made the best of it and quickly walked over to Moanna as she was walking down the hallway. Moanna did her best to avoid looking at Gregory. She was very tempted to start up a conversation with his attendant but she knew that he wouldn't say anything. They walked in silence to the dining hall and Moanna was glad for this. She made an excuse to go over and talk to her mother and was soon away from Gregory. However she felt that in the future it was going to be a lot harder. --- That night while everyone was at dinner Seda was talking to the Faun in the forest. \"—and you still have not done anything about it!\" Seda was clearly exasperated and glaring at the Faun. She was one of the few beings in this world (and probably a few others) that would ever take to lecturing the Faun. The Faun was aware of this and so he continued to listen impassively. This seemed to get Seda even angrier though. \"Are you not going to do anything at all?\" The Faun, to Seda's clear frustration continued to look at her unemotionally. After a moment though he shook his head slightly and sighed. Seda lost the angry look on her face when she realized that the Faun wasn't as unaffected as he'd previously pretended to be. \"Well?\" She prompted, a little more kindly this time. The Faun tilted his head. \"And what precisely will you have me do Seda? If her parents wish for her to marry Gregory it will not matter. It would be for the best anyway.\" Seda looked at him in disbelief. \"Are you even aware of what you are saying?\" When the Faun didn't say anything she continued. \"It would not be for the best if Moanna married that Prince.\" She looked over at him. \"You have to talk to her Faun and tell her how you feel.\" The Faun was still silent but before Seda could say anything he replied quietly. \"I will speak with her tomorrow then.\" Seda smiled merrily and her smile was not at all devoid of smugness. \"Good. I will see you tomorrow then.\" Before he could answer her, Seda had faded back into another tree. Leaving the Faun alone with his thoughts. oOoOo The next day Moanna had a plan. She was going to look for the Faun. However she would have to be careful to avoid Gregory. She had managed to evade Gregory after breakfast by slipping out the door that led to the kitchen. The people there were surprised to see her but as they all liked Moanna she knew they wouldn't tell anyone she came through that way. Moanna doubted that Gregory would bother to ask servants anyway. - She was looking through the rooms of the castle when she heard someone coming around the corner. She quickly ran down the hall hoping she hadn't been too noisy. -- Doctor Blightly looked curiously down the hallway he had turned into. He could have sworn that he'd heard someone running down it. He shrugged slightly and turned to go back. Unfortunately when he turned he knocked into someone who was behind him. \"I am dreadfully sorry.\" Dr. Blightly said quickly, offering his hand to the person. He looked down to find Seda glaring at him. She made a point to ignore his hand as she picked herself off the ground. \"Watch where you are going human.\" \"I am very sorry. I'm afraid I wasn't looking where I was going closely enough.\" Dr. Blightly said trying to stop himself from backing away from Seda's glare. \"That is quite obvious.\" Seda replied, the glare still present on her face. Seda made to walk past the doctor when he suddenly started talking. \"Um…my lady?\" He called her this because he was fairly certain that if he called her Seda he'd be in trouble. This seemed to catch her attention though as she turned around to face him. \"Yes, what is it human?\" \"I would just like to apologize.\" Whatever Seda had been expecting him to say, it hadn't been that. Dr. Blightly could see this by her expression. She composed herself quickly though. \"Why whatever for?' \"I did not mean any offence yesterday when I asked you why you did not like humans.\" Dr. Blightly said quickly. \"I was merely curious, that was all.\" Seda looked at him suspiciously but after a few seconds of consideration replied. \"Very well.\" She turned to go but then seemed to have a thought. \"You do not happen to know where Moanna is, do you?\" \"No, I haven't seen her since breakfast. She seemed to disappear. Do want some help looking?\" Seda seemed to consider this for another moment. \"Very well…Doctor. You may come with me.\" She continued walking and after standing there for a moment Dr. Blightly continued after her. Maybe she wasn't as scary as he thought she was. -- Gregory was irritated. Somehow he had managed to lose track of Moanna. He had been planning to talk to her more today. He was sure that if they talked to each other he could convince her that marrying him was the best course, the only course. In fact he was so sure of himself that he was positive he could convince her. He smiled smugly then frowned; he still had yet to find Moanna. Maybe she was looking for him around the castle. Yes, he thought to himself, she probably was. Well he had better go and find her then. -- Gregory ended up walking into a few empty rooms before he saw anyone. However it wasn't Moanna. It was her father the King and…some strange looking creature. After a few minutes of blatant staring he realized that this was that faun he had heard about. \"Did you need something Gregory?\" The King asked looking up from a map he'd been looking at. \"I have just finished asking the Faun's advice on a rather pressing matter.\" He failed to notice the high prince's amazed look. The Faun however noticed but didn't say anything as he was used to it. \"Do you know where Moanna is, your majesty?\" Gregory asked politely. \"Oh, she's around here somewhere.\" The King said offhand as he went back to looking at the map, till a thought struck him. \"Come here for a moment Gregory.\" He waved a hand for the irritated looking prince to come over. - After awhile Gregory had finished answering all the King's questions and he looked around the room. There seemed to be something missing. \"Your majesty, wasn't there something else in here with us a while ago?\" Gregory asked slightly confused. The King looked around. \"Why? There is nothing missing from here.\" He looked at Gregory in slight amusement. \"You must be seeing things young man.\" Gregory looked affronted. \"I did not. There was that faun thing you were talking to a while ago.\" The King looked at him. \"The Faun left a while ago, if that's who you were referring to.\" Gregory decided that it would be best if he left. \"I must go and look for the Princess Moanna.\" \"Very well.\" The King waved his hand at the disappearing form. oOoOo Moanna had forgotten how large the castle was when you were looking for someone. It was even worse when you considered the fact that whoever you were looking for might be moving around as well. Moanna was sure that with her luck she was just missing the Faun. She had however found Gregory, multiple times in fact. Though she had always managed to get away before he could see her. He seemed to be looking for her, something that brought her no happiness. She was well aware that he only wanted to marry her for her kingdom and nothing he could say would convince her otherwise. So avoiding him seemed the best trick so far. - She was just about to leave the room she had been looking in. It was the room she usually had lessons with the Faun with and she'd been hoping he might have been in there. Unfortunately her bad luck was holding still and the room had been empty. At that moment Stephan walked in the room and Moanna froze. Stephan did so as well and for a moment the room was in silence. Then there were footsteps coming close to the room. Stephan looked around the room. \"Moanna, if that is my brother I can not lie to him. You have to get away.\" Moanna blinked. \"Why do you care? You tried to kill me?\" Stephan groaned. \"I am supposed to help people. That is what being a prince is all about. I just made some mistakes. Now if you do not hurry my brother will find you. Unlike the rest of the world I do not like my brother but I can not lie to him. That is why I am warning you.\" With that he walked out of the room. Moanna just stared at where he'd been standing. She was brought out of her daze when she heard voices directly outside the room. \"—seen Moanna?\" \"I think she may have been in that room.\" Moanna whirled around the room. There was no where to hide. The room contained only a desk, a chalkboard and some books. Seeing no alternative Moanna dashed behind a particularly large stack of books, knowing fully well that she would be spotted easily if Gregory took more then a passing glance into the room. Oh how she wished she was invisible! She wished that even more so when she heard the footsteps enter the room and Gregory calling her name. She heard the footsteps get closer and closer till they were directly in front of the pile of books. \"Hmmm Moanna?\" Gregory said softly. \"Are you hiding behind the books?\" Moanna closed her eye tightly waiting for the cry of triumph….except it never came. \"I guess my dear brother was mistaken then.\" Gregory said to himself. Moanna looked up and almost made a noise when she saw Gregory was looking down at her. Actually he seemed to be looking through her. Moanna gasped as she looked at her hands, she could see them but they were extremely faint. Like a shadow…Moanna's eyes went wide. Was she invisible? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well I hoped you liked this Chapter. It was originally going to be longer but well, this seemed li ke a good place for it to end. Also if anyone is worried, no I am not letting Bella off. She will be getting her just deserts later on. Revenge is a dish best served cold….(insert evil laughter here) Anyway, please leave a review and tell me what you thought of it.[Chapter 14] Disclaimer: I do not own anything… .anything at all. A/N- Just a reminder that all the words in italics are translated from fairy. I hope you like the chapter. Please read, review and enjoy. Chapter Fourteen: Proposals Moanna stared down at her hands. How could she be invisible, it just wasn't possible. Gregory had left moments ago in search of her and if she wasn't in shock Moanna suspected she would be laughing. He'd been looking right at her and he still hadn't seen her. Very slowly Moanna stood up, as though afraid she was going to disappear altogether if she moved too quickly. As she started to walk across the room she realized with a jolt that she didn't know how to make herself visible. She froze in the middle of the room. What if she was stuck like this forever? She quickly took a few deep breathes to calm herself down. If she'd made herself invisible it stood to reason that she would be able to make herself visible as well…right? - After many attempts to make herself visible, Moanna was starting to feel discouraged. She was still invisible but there was nothing else she could think to do. So Moanna decided to use her newfound state to her advantage and continue her search. At least this way she was positive that Gregory wouldn't find her. Of course no one else would either. Walking out into the hallway she tried to remember the parts of the castle that she had all ready searched. After a few moments she remembered what way she'd been going and promptly set off in the other direction. Moanna still thought it was funny when she was walking in the same hallway with someone and they didn't notice her. She just had to remember to keep quiet otherwise people might start to wonder if the castle was haunted. Moanna decided to go and check the library to see if the Faun was there. Unfortunately she was still wrong but there were some people in there. It was Seda and Dr. Blightly and they were at the end of the room. Moanna was just about to leave when she heard her name being called. Turning around quite surprised, Moanna saw Seda waving at her as though she could see her. Dr. Blightly on the other hand looked very confused. -- - \"Who are you talking to?\" Dr. Blightly asked looking around the room in confusion. As far as he could see the library was empty. \"It is Moanna. For some reason she is invisible.\" Seda replied calmly, motioning again for Moanna to come over. Far from being reassured this just made Dr. Blightly even more confused. \"Moanna, what happened?\" Seda seemed to be speaking to air, so when the air replied Dr. Blightly was quite surprised. \"I don't know Seda. I was hiding from Gregory and then he couldn't see me. I just can't figure out how to make myself visible again.\" Seda paused, thinking for a moment. \"Well this is most peculiar. However I believe I can help you.\" \"Wait, how can you see me?\" Seda smiled. \"I believe the reason you became invisible is because I gave you part of my power. As it was part of my own power I can still see you when no one else can. Though to be you do look faded to me.\" \"Oh.\" \"Now hold out your hands apart from each other like this.\" Seda demonstrated, holding her hands apart, palms facing each other. \"Now just think about what you look like. What you have done is hidden yourself by fading your image until people can see through you. To become visible again you merely have to concentrate on bringing yourself back into focus.\" Moanna closed her eyes and she pictured what she would have seen if she was looking in a mirror. Very slowly she started to reappear causing Dr. Blightly to gasp in shock When she was finished she looked down at her hands and then smiled at Dr. Blightly. \"Hello.\" \"Moanna…\" Dr. Blightly trailed off, he couldn't think of what to say. \"Have you seen the Faun?\" Moanna turned to Seda hopefully. \"I've been looking for him all over the castle.\" \"I have not seen him since last night Moanna.\" Seda replied. \"I better go and look for him then.\" Moanna said about to turn around when Seda stopped her. \"Before you do Moanna I think we should have a talk. Excuse us.\" She said to Dr. Blightly as she pulled Moanna over to a corner. - \"Moanna, I fear I may have been mistaken about something.\" Seda said gravely. \"About what?\" Moanna asked growing worried at the tone of Seda's voice. \"Nothing too serious.\" Seda reassured Moanna. \"However I may have been mistaken about the amount of power you received. I certainly did not think that you had received enough to fade out of sight. However now that I know you do have the power you will need to learn how to control it.\" She paused and then continued. \"I will give you lessons, on one condition Moanna.\" \"What condition?\" Moanna asked slightly suspicious. \"You must inform your parents you are no longer all human.\" Seda said firmly. \"Only after you have done that will I teach you.\" Moanna fell silent. She knew that she was going to have to tell her parents eventually. If she didn't learn how to control this power she could end up doing something horrible by accident. \"Very well. I will tell my parents.\" Moanna said slowly. She wasn't sure what her parent's reaction would be when she told them though. Seda seemed to understand this. \"Go, find the Faun and speak to him before you tell your parents.\" She smiled down at Moanna. \"Go and find him quickly before you run into that human prince you are avoiding. I do not think it would be wise for you attempt to fade out again.\" Moanna nodded. \"I had better go then.\" She said goodbye to Seda, and Dr. Blightly as well before she left the library. She decided that she would go and look outside for the Faun. She figured that it would be easier for her to hide outside if Gregory happened to be out there. Especially if she couldn't become invisible to avoid him. oOoOo Gregory still hadn't managed to find Moanna. He was sure that he had found her one time. His brother had told him that he had seen her in a room but she hadn't been there. He'd had words with his brother about that. He didn't want Stephan to think that he could get away with lying to him. It was bad enough that Stephan and Bella hadn't gotten Moanna to marry Stephan but they almost got themselves arrested for treason. They were morons, though at least with Bella gone Gregory could control Stephan. After it had seemed like he'd searched the entire castle he had gone to ask the queen if she knew where Moanna was. She had suggested he look in the library but he'd decided not to look in there to closely when he saw a man talking to some sort of strange looking woman who was dressed in what looked like a grey toga. Upon further questioning the Queen suggested that he go look outside, though she suggested that he should avoid the forest. Apparently it was dangerous, something Stephan found amusing but he really had no desire to find out. Though it appeared that Moanna liked the forest. Gregory smiled like something that has spotted their prey. Moanna was standing in front of the forest talking to some sort of small flying creature. Gregory decided to walk over to see her. -- --- Once outside Moanna decided that the best plan she had was to look for the Faun by the forest. It seemed like as good a place as any to start and anyway she always felt a connection to the forest. While she was standing by one of the outer tree's she noticed a fairy flying by. To her enjoyment she was able to recognize the fairy. \" Hello Lillandra.\" Smiled Moanna, waving for the fairy to come over. \" Moanna! You are well again!\" The fairy flew in front of Moanna. Moanna could have sworn that the fairy was smiling. Moanna started telling Lillandra what had happened to her since the last time she'd seen her. She was so wrapped up in trying to think of the right words that she didn't notice someone walking over behind them. \"Hello Moanna.\" At the sound of the voice Moanna whirled around to discover Gregory standing behind her. \"Uhh, hello…\" Moanna trailed off. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I was looking to talk to you, my dear, sweet Moanna.\" Gregory said in a horribly clichéd manner. \"Yes…well. I'm talking to Lillandra right now.\" Moanna gestured towards the fairy. \"Maybe we could talk another time.\" Moanna turned around and continued to talk to Lillandra. Gregory just didn't seem to take a hint though. \"What is that tiny thing Moanna?\" Moanna turned back to him. \"Her name is Lillandra and she happens to be my friend.\" Gregory frowned, this wasn't going the way he wanted at all. He tried to backtrack. \"Of course Moanna. I know such a kind princess as you would be friends with any creature.\" Moanna was staring at him with an astonished look but he didn't seem to notice. He just continued talking anyway. \"I know you are kind enough to be friends with such a disgusting creature as that Faun as well.\" Moanna froze. \"What did you call him?\" She said through clenched teeth. She decided she didn't want to hear anything he had to say. She turned back to Lillandra muttering insults in fairy. Lillandra was laughing at this, she thought it was cute that Moanna was sticking up for the Faun. Gregory didn't like that Moanna was ignoring him. He saw Moanna turn around and grabbed her arm. \"Moanna, wait.\" Moanna tried to pull her arm away but he was too strong. \"Let go of me!\" As Moanna continued to grab her arm away Lillandra flew in front of Gregory's face. Distracted he let go of Moanna. \"Agh, get out of here you freak!\" He tried to bat Lillandra out of the way and he ended up knocking her roughly to the ground. When Moanna saw this she rushed forwards pushing Gregory out of the way. He was caught off balanced by this and fell to the ground. Moanna ignored Gregory and carefully scooped Lillandra off the ground. \" Lillandra, are you okay? Please say something.\" Gregory picked himself up off the ground. \"I can not believe you Moanna. That thing is not worthy of your concern.\" He was angry now and made to hit Lillandra out of Moanna's hand. However something caught his hand above his head. Gregory angrily looked back, about to say something but his words were caught in his throat when he saw behind him. The Faun had caught Gregory's hand before he could take another swing at Lillandra. \"Never.\" The Faun said in a quiet voice. \"Never touch any creature under my protection.\" He let Gregory's arm go and the prince stumbled backwards. Casting one seething look back at the Faun he steadied himself. \"You will pay for that, you… you monster! I am a high prince!\" With those parting words Gregory ran back to the castle as quickly as he could. Moanna was so angry that if she hadn't been holding the injured fairy she would have…well she wasn't sure what she might have done. The Faun seemed to have some idea as when he walked over he put a hand on her shoulder. \"Moanna calm down, let me see her.\" Without a word Moanna passed Lillandra carefully to the Faun. After a few minutes the Faun looked up. \"Her wing is broken.\" Moanna cringed when he said this. \"This is my fault.\" She said quietly. \"I should have just talked to him. He wouldn't have grabbed my arm and then he wouldn't have hit Lillandra when she tried to make him let go.\" She whipped away a tear. \"Is she going to be all right?\" The Faun was about to say something when Seda suddenly appeared next to him. \"You can help her Moanna.\" - Slightly startled by Seda's strange entrance it took awhile for Moanna to get her thoughts together. \"What can I do?\" \"Place your hands above her.\" Seda gently led Moanna closer to the Faun and positioned the girl's hands, hovering above Lillandra. \"Now close your eyes and repeat after me. vigoratus, vigoratus, curatio, vigoratus.\" Feeling slightly odd Moanna repeated what she had heard. Suddenly she felt as though there was a pulse of light in her forehead that was traveling down her arms and into her hands. Looking down she realized that here hands were letting off a pale green light. It was a warm feeling, running through her fingers. After a few moments Seda pulled Moanna's hands away. \"That is enough power. She should be fine now.\" Indeed Lillandra seemed to be getting up, standing a little shakily on the Fauns hand. \"I will take her back to the forest then.\" The Faun said. \"She needs rest.\" \"I can take her.\" Seda insisted. \"Moanna wanted to tell you something anyway.\" She placed her hand out and Lillandra flew onto it slowly before coming to a rest. \"There.\" Seda smiled down at the fairy as a mother would to a small child. \"Let me take you home then.\" Moanna chuckled a bit when she heard the fairies response about not talking to her like an infant. She watched as Seda walked deep into the forest. She realized then that she didn't know where the fairies lived. … \"What was it you wished to tell me Moanna?\" The Faun asked her curiously breaking her from her thoughts. She turned around quickly looking up at the Faun. \"Seda wanted me to tell you that she would be giving me lessons on controlling the power she gave me. It seems she gave me a little too much.\" The Faun tilted his head to the side questioningly. \"How did you discover that?\" Moanna looked down at her hands, slightly embarrassed. \"I was hiding from Gregory behind a stack of books and accidentally turned myself invisible.\" Hearing a strange sound, Moanna looked up to see the Faun…laughing? Well he was chuckling a little. Moanna looked at him amazed and then started laughing herself. \"I forgot how nice your laugh was.\" Moanna said after she had stopped laughing. \"You can be too serious sometimes.\" The Faun had a small smile on his face. \"That has been said to me in the past.\" He admitted. Moanna rolled her eyes. \"I know. I was the one who said it.\" A silence fell between them after that. Neither one of them really knew what to say. However after a few minutes Moanna broke the silence. \"Seda says that I have to tell my parents about my….my not being fully human or she won't teach me how to control my power.\" The Faun looked at her closely. \"Are you worried of what your parents will say?\" Moanna nodded. \"A little. I know they love me but…it will be a shock.\" \"Do not worry.\" The Faun replied quietly. \"If they love you they will support you.\" Moanna suddenly smiled little. \"Maybe Gregory won't want to marry me when he finds out I'm not all human.\" That thought cheered her up a bit. She noticed the Faun was looking at her closely. \"So you do not wish to marry this Prince?\" The Faun asked cautiously. Moanna gave him a skeptical look. \"What do you think?\" When he didn't say anything she sighed. \"I told you before that I'm not going to marry someone unless I'm in love with them and the day I fall in love with someone like Gregory or Stephan is the day….\" Moanna paused trying to think of something both highly unlikely and dramatic. \"The day Seda decides to help some human's burn down a forest.\" The Faun tilted his head. \"Then I will take that as a no.\" Moanna almost rolled her eyes. She was about to say something when she was interrupted by a voice. Looking next to her she saw Stephan who was looking like he really did not want to be there. \"Moanna, the King and Queen would like a word with you in the castle. \"Did they say why?\" Moanna asked, curious. \"….\" Stephan didn't say anything for a moment. \"I think I'll let them explain.\" Moanna turned to the Faun. \"Will you come with me?\" The Faun bowed his head slightly. \"Of course.\" The three of them made their way up to the castle. No one was talking and Moanna was starting to worry. Why was Stephan acting so nervous? There wasn't anything wrong with her mother was there? He wouldn't have said that the Queen wanted to speak to her in that case. At least that's what Moanna hoped. She also was wondering if she could trust Stephan. oOoOo Once inside the castle Stephan stopped them outside a door. Looking over at the Faun he said nervously. \"Umm…they would like to speak with Moanna by themselves.\" The Faun didn't say anything but stepped backwards away from the door. Making clear his intention to wait. \"Well…I think that's fine…\" Stephan said still nervous, turning to Moanna. \"Uh, follow me then…\" Moanna was starting to grow very suspicious of Stephan's edginess. She looked back before she entered the room to see Dr. Blightly walking down the hallway. She smiled, he was probably going to ask the Faun where Seda had vanished too. She'd been fairly certain that the two of them had been talking when Seda appeared suddenly in front of the forest. Moanna walked inside the room and jumped a bit when Stephan closed the door a little too hard. He looked over at her sheepishly. \"Sorry about that Moanna.\" Moanna however was busy looking around the room. It was empty save for a large table with some papers on it and some chairs. It looked like a meeting room of some sorts. \"Where are my parents?\" Moanna said turning quickly towards Stephan, who backed up at her apprehensive gaze. \"This had better not be another trick Stephan.\" \"This is not a trick Moanna. I assure you.\" A voice came from the room and Moanna looked to see Gregory standing there. \"This is a trick.\" She glared Stephan and he took another step backwards. \"Moanna settle down.\" Gregory said in an infuriating calm voice. \"I simply wanted to have a little talk with you. You can be assured that nothing bad will happen to you. I even have my knight of a brother here, incase you get nervous.\" Moanna stopped glaring at Stephan but she didn't relax in any other way. \"Very well. What did you wish to talk to me about?\" \"Come over here.\" Gregory gestured to the table that he was standing by. When she slowly came over he picked up some papers. \"I want you and I to come to an agreement.\" He looked over at her smiling slightly. \"Marry me, Moanna.\" Moanna looked at him calmly. She'd been expecting some kind of idiotic proposal. \"No.\" She replied firmly. \"Can I go now?\" Gregory clutched the piece of paper he was holding a little tighter. \"No, I think you should take a little more interest in my proposal Moanna.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because I happen to know something that you would not want your parents to find out about.\" \"A bit doubt flashed across Moanna's features but she managed to stay impassive. \"And what exactly do my parents not know about?\" Gregory grinned evilly. \"Why Moanna, the fact that you are no longer a human.\" … Moanna's eyes widened, her thoughts racing. How did he know that? Then a thought struck her and she turned to look at Stephan. \"You.\" She spat out, causing Stephan to take another involuntary step backwards. Unfortunately for him he'd run out of room and subsequently backed into the wall. Moanna turned back at Gregory who was still smiling. \"So you see Moanna. You do not really have much of a choice. Marry me and your parents will never find out that you are really a freak now. If you refuse then I will tell them and…\" He paused. \"Well I do not know what they will do but I am sure that it will not be pleasant.\" He held out a piece of paper and a quill pen. \"Sign the contract Moanna. It really is your only choice.\" Quietly Moanna sighed and took the paper. However just as Gregory was about to laugh, she ripped it in half. \"I will never marry you Gregory.\" Moanna said, dropping the pieces of paper on the floor. Quiet fury dripping from her words. Gregory looked at her in amazement. Then he collected himself. \"Very well Moanna, well I hate to leave so quickly but I think there is something I need to tell your parents of.\" \"Stop.\" Moanna held up her hand. \"There is nothing you can do to stop me Moanna.\" Gregory smirked. \"Unless you agree to marry me.\" \"That wasn't what I meant.\" Moanna replied. \"I will tell my parents myself.\" With that she walked towards the door. Behind her Gregory made a gesture and Stephan stepped in front of the door. \"Not so fast Princess.\" Gregory said walking over. \"I do not believe that you will tell the King and Queen. So please allow Stephan and I the honor of escorting you to them.\" He held out his hand and again Moanna ignored it. \"If you wish.\" She replied, opening the door, herself wishing very much that she didn't have to have an audience when she told her parents. -- Well I hope you liked the chapter. Please remember to leave a review and tell me what you think.[Chapter 15] Disclaimer: I'm fairly certain that by now everyone knows I don't own Pan's Labyrinth. A/N- Thanks so much for the reviews guys! Just a warning, this chapter contains some fluff. You have been warned. Hope you like it, and leave a review! Chapter Fifteen : Surprises All Around If anyone had cared to ask her, Moanna could have explained in great detail the feelings that a condemned man felt walking towards his death. It was a slightly sickly emotion but it was far better then what she had been feeling before. That was because like many prisoners Moanna had accepted her fate and though she hadn't received a last meal or last request she was feeling oddly determined. Walking outside the room she saw surprise clearly register on Dr. Blightly's face. The Faun however betrayed no visible emotion. To add to Gregory's confusion Moanna turned to face the Faun and Dr. Blightly. \"I am going to tell my parents the truth now.\" She said with a stony face, devoid of all emotion. Dr. Blightly still looked taken aback but the Faun merely nodded. He had expected something like this happening soon. Though why Gregory and Stephan were with her he didn't know. Moanna walked down the hallway with Gregory and Stephan following behind her. Well Stephan would be following behind if Dr. Blightly hadn't quickly pulled him aside to demand to know what was going on. Gregory didn't notice this as he was too busy watching the marching princess in front of him. He was starting to have a small shred of worry that he had underestimated Moanna. Though he quickly banished that thought to the back of his mind. Moanna would marry him, whether she liked it or not. -- Moanna stopped outside her parent's sitting room. She wasn't sure that they would be there but it was the best place to look at the moment. She knew he mother enjoyed embroidering in her sitting room and since she'd been pregnant the King did his best not to leave his wife's side. That is why Moanna confidently knocked on the door and when she heard her mother's voice she was relived and slightly nervous. \"Hello mother, father.\" She said walking into the room. Her mother was sitting on a couch with a book and her father was….attempting to embroider. When he saw the strange looks he was getting he smiled. \"Your mother challenged me to try it.\" He looked down at the mess he was holding. \"It seems to be more difficult then I thought it would be.\" \"I did warn you.\" The Queen said lightly putting her book down. \"Now Moanna, Gregory, was there something you wished to speak to us about?\" \"Do I have to be setting up another betrothal ceremony soon?\" The King chuckled not noticing the expression on Moanna's face seemed to harden. \"I have to tell you something.\" Moanna said and she saw how her parents grew serious. They knew the tone very well and whenever Moanna used it she usually had something important to say. \"I don't really know how to say this.\" Moanna started but then saw Gregory smirk and went on. \"But I will before Gregory interrupts. I…you remember when I was poisoned and Seda helped me get better, don't you?\" The Queen nodded and though the King looked slightly confused at the name but he did as well. \"Well, the only way she could save me was to…give me some of her power and well…\" Moanna drew back her hair to reveal her pointed ears. \"I'm no longer completely….human.\" There was a pause in the room while her parents took this in. \"Oh Moanna.\" Her mother said softly, looking at daughter's nervous expression. Her own eyes clouded with un-spilled tears. \"I hope you do not think that we would love you any less because of this.\" She got up and walked over to her daughter. \"We love you no matter what my dear.\" Moanna's eyes grew misty at this and she gently hugged her mother. \"Thank you.\" Gregory was slightly disappointed in the lack of reaction from the Queen so he walked over to the King. \"I do hate to be the one that reminds everyone of this but Moanna can not rule as Queen if she is not fully human you know.\" The King looked slightly irritated at the high prince but he knew he was right and said so. \"He is right you know. Moanna will not be allowed to rule if people find out that she is no longer human.\" Moanna had been expecting this but her mother froze. \"That is ridiculous.\" \"I know.\" The King replied sadly looking at his daughter. \"But…what will happen to her?\" The Queen asked. Concern for her daughter visible all over her face. \"If I may make a suggestion your majesty?\" Gregory interrupted earning a glare from Moanna, which he ignored. \"If the lovely Moanna was to marry me then she could come with me to my kingdom and no one would have to know she was not human. She would be taken care of.\" Gregory walked over and wrapped an arm around Moanna's shoulder, which she attempted to push off. The King and Queen looked at each other then at Moanna. They really did want what was best for her. \"Well.\" The King spoke up, looking at Moanna. \"I am sure you two would be happy together.\" Moanna's eyes went wide, this wasn't supposed to be happening. Her momentary relief that her parents didn't hate her was just that, short lived. It was now being replaced by terror. If her parents said yes then she could be taken away a moment after they said it. Then she'd never get away and she'd never get to tell the Faun…. She finally succeeded in getting Gregory's arm off of her shoulders. \"No!\" She proclaimed loudly and everyone in the room looked at her. \"I can not marry him.\" She pointed to Gregory. Looking over at her mother with desperate eyes, pleading her. \"Didn't I tell you once mother that I only wanted to marry for love?\" When her mother nodded Moanna went on. \"Well I am in love mother, just not with a prince!\" Gregory was irritated at this, the King looked taken aback and the Queen was listening intently. \"Who do you love Moanna?\" Her mother prompted her. \"Yes, who Moanna?\" Gregory barely kept the mocking tone from his voice. Moanna smiled slightly, it was now or never. \"I…am in love with the Faun.\" Noticing the astonished expression on Gregory's face it was safe to say that Stephan had failed to pass along that little piece of information to him. However she herself was surprised by her mother's reaction. \"I suspected as much.\" Moanna and her father looked over at the Queen amazed. She smiled bitterly. \"It was one of the reason's I've been trying to get you to marry a prince Moanna.\" She sighed. \"I knew that if you loved the Faun you could never become Queen.\" \"Well it seems that no matter what I do I will never be Queen.\" Moanna put in lightly. She was surprised her parents were taking everything so well. Though she hadn't been too worried about her mother and her father still hadn't said much. -- \"I beg to defer.\" Gregory interrupted Moanna's thoughts and turned to face her. \"Marry me Moanna and you can still rule.\" When he saw her incredulous expression he tried a new tactic. He would play on her insecurities. \"Moanna. You say you love this creature. Yet has he ever told you that he felt the same way?\" Gregory attempted to keep a triumphant smile off his face when he saw Moanna's eyes looking slightly uncertain. \"You know he hasn't, has he? He's never told you that he loves you.\" He turned to face the King and Queen the latter who was starting to glance at him rather angrily. \"I believe that Moanna will be happier with me then she would be with…\" He wrinkled his nose. \"A faun. Who probably doesn't love anything, let alone such a wonderful person such as Moanna. That faun doesn't love you, does he Moanna?\" Tears pricked Moanna's eyes. \"How can you say things like that?\" \"It is a simple question Moanna.\" Gregory said without looking back. \"Does the Faun love you?\" \"Yes he does.\" A quiet voice replied from behind Moanna caused everyone to look in amazement. The Faun was standing behind Moanna his face as unreadable as ever. If Moanna looked to the back of the room she would have seen Dr. Blightly and Stephan standing by the doorway. However she, like everyone else in the room was paying attention to what had just happened. \"What did you say?\" Gregory demanded. The Faun didn't say anything to him but looked down at Moanna. \"I love you Moanna.\" Tears were at Moanna's eyes when he said this. He did love her! He had said so in front of a group of people. This meant a great deal to her as she knew how he felt about displaying emotion in public. The Queen was smiling at her daughter and patiently pulling the King from the room. Dr.Blightly had already pushed Stephan out of the room and was now attempting to get Gregory to leave without making a fuss. He didn't seem to want to and was making a rather large racket. Then in a flash of silver smoke he disappeared and while Moanna looked over surprised, Dr.Blightly left the room. \"What was that?\" Moanna looked over where Gregory had been standing. \"Seda, most likely.\" The Faun said, noticing that the room was empty. He looked back to see Moanna gazing at him. However the Faun felt that he had to ask Moanna something. So tentatively, almost nervously he asked her. \"Moanna many people will look down at you if we are…together. Are you sure this is what you want?\" Moanna's gaze seemed to harden but then she smiled. \"They are going to look down on me anyway.\" She indicated her ears and then continued lightly. \"I don't care what they think.\" She smiled at him again. \"You know I love you.\" There was a small smile on the Fauns face because he never thought he'd hear her say that, but he felt he had to ask one more question. \"Why?\" Moanna didn't seem surprised by the question as she was still smiling. \"I love you because you are kind and gentle.\" she started in a serious tone. \"I love you because you are wise and caring. I love you because you will protect me and let me protect myself. I love you because you will not think I am weak because I am female. I love you because throughout my life you have always been there for me.\" She looked at him intently then went on. \"Most importantly, I love you because you are you.\" The Faun was taken aback by the sincerity in her answer and the determined look in her eyes. He didn't think that he had seen anyone in his life that looked as beautiful to him as Moanna did now. The Faun hugged Moanna and touched her lightly on the head. \"I love you too.\" oOoOo \"Might I ask what you are doing?\" Dr. Blightly was watching Seda making hand motions over a small handheld mirror. She hadn't noticed the doctor entering the room and when he spoke up she dropped the mirror on the ground. It promptly broke into pieces. \"My apologies.\" Dr. Blightly said wondering if he should be making a hasty exit. Seda however waved it off. \"It is of no importance. I was merely attempting to discover where I had sent that obnoxious prince.\" Seeing the startled look on Dr. Blightly's face she continued. \"I am fairly certain he's somewhere in the castle.\" She paused at a thought then added carelessly. \"Though, I have been wrong before.\" \"Oh.\" Was the only thing Dr. Blightly could think of saying. There was a silence as Seda began to pick up the broken mirror pieces. Dr.Blightly went over and helped her. \"…Thank-you.\" Seda said after he'd passed the pieces to her. Glancing at him a little suspiciously as she put the pieces onto the table she was standing by. \"You're welcome.\" Dr. Blightly smiled. \"It was my fault you broke it after all.\" Seda still looked a little suspicious but she seemed to accept his reason. \"How did you know to make Gregory vanish?\" Dr.Blightly asked a question that had been bothering him for a while. \"You weren't even in the room.\" At this Seda smiled widely and Dr. Blightly blinked for a moment. Seda's grins were slightly sinister looking. \"I was there.\" Seda explained. \"You just couldn't see me. I was just there to make sure that Moanna told her parents.\" \"Well at least that, is over with.\" Dr. Blightly sighed as he sat onto a chair. \"That and the fact that those two finely admitted their feelings to each other.\" There was no need to say who the two were. \"I have not been here before this.\" Seda said curiously. \"Was it clear to everyone else but them?\" \"Just about.\" Dr. Blightly admitted. \"Though they only seemed to realize recently.\" \"I am not surprised.\" Seda said lightly as she went back to fitting the mirror pieces together. \"The Faun never was a type to revel emotions easily.\" After fixing the last sliver of the mirror in place Seda did another little hand gesture and the mirror slid back together, as though it had never been broken. Dr. Blightly was starting to get used to the strange things that the woman did so he wasn't nearly as surprised as he would have been before. \"Found him.\" Seda remarked idly as she looked into the now foggy mirror. \"Gregory?\" Dr. Blightly asked looking into the mirror. \"Where is he?\" \"I would have to say…..\" Seda looked closely. \"Yes, I feel that it safe to say that his royal highness is in the stables. Locked in actually. If his banging on the door is anything to go by.\" Dr. Blightly sighed. \"I suppose we should let him out.\" \"You can, if you feel so inclined.\" Seda said indifferently as she made the mirror disappear. \"I really have no intentions on doing anything to help a human.\" There was an awkward pause in the room. As though Seda had suddenly remembered she was talking to a human. \"I will let him out.\" A voice came from the doorway and both Seda and Dr. Blightly looked over to see Stephan standing there. \"I will go and get my brother out.\" Stephan repeated as though he was trying to talk himself into something. When there were no protests he sighed and started to walk down the hallway. oOoOo When Stephan unlocked the stable door he could safely say that he was a little worried what state his brother would be in. Gregory had never taken kindly to being said no to. Even when they were little he'd been spoiled. He also had a problem controlling his anger. So when Stephan opened the door he wasn't sure what exactly he would find. There wasn't much light in the stable as having torch's would have brought the risk of the hay catching on fire. However Stephan was able to spot his brother standing in the middle of the room. Glaring….at him. \"Hello Gregory.\" Stephan greeted his older brother halfheartedly. \"Are you all right?\" \"What do you think?\" Gregory replied in a nasty voice as he walked over. \"You failed to mention that Moanna was in love with a faun, didn't you.\" \"I didn't think it mattered.\" Stephan sputtered, not wanting to reveal the truth. That he'd been embarrassed to say that Moanna had fallen in love with a creature like that faun rather then him. \"No, you didn't think.\" Gregory spat back. \"That is your problem Stephan. You never think. If you had thought , then you'd be married to Moanna by now.\" Stephan hung his head. \"Is it over then?\" Gregory clenched his fists ignoring his brother. \"This is a disaster. If people find out that I have been rejected….for a Faun, I will be a joke.\" He groaned. \"And I know Bella will love to pass this story on.\" Looking back he noticed his brother backing off. \"Are you even listening to me?\" He gritted his teeth. \"I will not accept this. I will not end up a laughingstock. I will have my revenge!\" Stephan looked at Gregory. \"What are you going to do?\" Gregory laughed. \"Do not worry Stephan. Though you are an idiot I may have a place for you in my plan but first we need to return home. This plan may take a while.\" \"How long?\" \"Patience Stephan. Just long enough for it to be foolproof.\" Gregory also knew that he would have to make sure his brother had his loyalties on the right side before they began. Perhaps he needed a little reminding that Moanna had chosen a faun over him as well. Gregory smirked as he led his brother back into the castle. This plan would have to be perfect. oOoOo It was latter that afternoon when Moanna and the Faun walked into Dr. Blightly's office to find him playing a game of chess with Seda. \"Oh, the lovebirds return.\" Seda said idly smirking as she took another one of the doctor's pawns. Moanna blushed slightly but ignored the comment and the Faun merely shook his head in amusement. \"Who's winning?\" Moanna asked looking at the chess board. \"I am.\" Seda replied. \"Just like the last three games.\" \"I won the last one.\" Dr. Blightly protested. \"You only started off winning.\" \"Yes, well that counts as winning as well.\" Moanna laughed as the Faun commented quietly to her. \"Seda is a very poor loser. We should be happy that nothing serious has befallen Dr. Blightly at his victory.\" \"I heard that.\" Seda said without looking back. Moanna rolled her eyes at this and then went back to talking to the Faun. Soon the room was in a comfortable silence with only the Faun and Moanna's quiet conversation and the noise from the chess pieces breaking it. However after awhile there was a knock on the door causing everyone to look up. \"Hello.\" Stephan said nervously. \"I…uh though you might want to know that…my brother and I are going home.\" There was a silence, then. \"Good.\" Everyone turned to Seda until they realized that it was Moanna who had said this. Stephan looked slightly shocked by this but continued anyway. \"I was just wondering if I could say good bye... Moanna.\" \"Good bye.\" \"I was hoping to say good bye in private.\" There was a pause and Moanna (as well as everyone else in the room) looked at Stephan suspiciously. \"Why?\" \"I merely wished to tell you something.\" \"You can say it in front of everyone then.\" There was a pause and Stephan didn't say anything. Seda didn't bother looking at the door as she spoke up. \"Go talk to him Moanna. If he does not have you back in five minutes, I will come and get you myself.\" Stephan gulped, glad that he actually wasn't planning anything. That woman scared him. Moanna walked over to the door in the side of the room. \"I will give you five minutes then.\" Once outside she closed the door. They were in one of the castle's various guest rooms. This one hadn't been in use for awhile so it was fairly empty. \"What did you want to say, Stephan?\" Moanna turned to look at the prince. \"I wanted to tell you that my brother is very angry.\" Moanna blinked. \"Why are you telling me this?\" \"Because my brother always gets what he wants, he always has.\" \"Then it's time someone said no to him.\" Moanna crossed her arms. \"I'm not changing my mind, if that's what he sent you to ask.\" \"He doesn't know I'm here.\" Stephan said quietly. \"I don't want you to get hurt Moanna. Gregory will want to get revenge.\" \"I can take care of myself.\" Stephan shook his head scornfully and Moanna could tell he was still sexist. \"If that's all…\" Moanna trailed off. \"I…uh…also wanted to…apologize…for you know..\" \"Trying to kill me?\" Moanna said as Stephan looked at his feet. \"Think nothing of it. I'm starting to get used to it. I'll just never trust you again...that's all.\" \"Oh.\" Stephan said stiffly. \"Well, good bye, then.\" He walked over to the door and was soon gone. Moanna watched after him. She didn't like him anymore then she liked Bella but at least he wasn't as bad as his brother. She walked out of the room and went over to the Faun who was watching the chess game. \"What did the prince want?\" Seda asked as she made a move. \"Oh, nothing much.\" Moanna said lightly. \"Just that Gregory would more then likely attempt to get revenge. Also he tried to apologize.\" \"For almost killing you?\" Dr. Blightly scoffed. \"He's just lucky that his brother came up with that cover story about the poisoner.\" \"Yes, he could be in a lot of trouble then.\" Moanna laughed. \"So now who's winning?\" She leaned against the Faun and they continued to watch the chess game. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --- -- Well I hope you liked the chapter. It took awhile but they're together now! Just a note, we'll be skipping ahead a couple of months in the next one. Also this story seems to be coming to an end soon and I don't see there being more then one or two more chapters left. (Though I will not swear to that) Leave a review and tell me what you thought![Chapter 16] Disclaimer- I do not own Pans Labyrinth…though I do own the dvd now! A/N- Thanks for all the reviews guys! Very, very inspirational. Ha I just got Pans Labyrinth (insert random squeals of joy here). My day just got ten times better!!! I hope you like this chapter. Read, review and most of all enjoy!! Chapter Sixteen: The Miracles of Life It had been about three months since Gregory and Stephan had left. --------------- Though she was certain of her parent's support Moanna had been slightly wary of the people of the land finding out. However as the time went on she was pleased to find out that everyone was focused on the Queens pregnancy and so Moanna felt no need to tell her own news just yet. She was glad that Seda didn't seem to mind this as apparently she had only been concerned about Moanna telling her parents. This of course meant that Moanna was now receiving lessons once a week from Seda on controlling her power. It wasn't as hard as Moanna had thought it was going to be but in some ways it wasn't as easy either. This may have been slightly confusing to some people but to Moanna it made perfect sense. The Faun hadn't questioned her logic when he asked how her lessons were going. Dr. Blightly and her parents didn't either but Moanna suspected this was because they had no idea what she was talking about. .-. It was mid afternoon when Moanna was walking back up to the castle with Seda. She was happy as she was finally able to control her ability to turn invisible. Ironically the very first power she'd used was the hardest for her to master. Seda said it was because she'd been doing it the wrong way. Somehow she hadn't been surprised. \"You are going down to the town today?\" Seda asked as they were coming to the castle. \"Yes.\" Moanna replied. \"Our cook is on leave as she is helping her daughter and her son-in-law move in.\" She shrugged. \"Tania is the sort of person that feels compelled to feed people constantly. I'm going there to pick up some food for my mother.\" Seda chuckled. \"Are you sure that the Queen is not just trying to get rid of you?\" \"Oh I know she is.\" Moanna replied as they reached the front of the castle. \"She told me so herself. She says it's bad enough with my father hovering over her.\" \"But you still intend to check up on her again?\" \"Yes.\" Seda sighed, sometimes she was glad that she didn't have children. .-. \"Are you going to play chess with Dr. Blightly?\" Moanna asked. \"Yes. He is the only person I can find that is almost as good at playing chess as I am…. almost. \" Moanna laughed as they walked into the castle. \"Good luck then.\" oOoOo Checking up on her mother had been a simple enough task. The Queen was due to give birth any day now and she was getting annoyed with the constant attention she was receiving. Moanna hadn't even got her head in the door before she was quickly kicked out again by her father. So she was now on her way to the town bellow the castle. It wasn't that far of a walk and she had made it many times before. It had been one of the few places that she had been allowed to go to without a guard when she was younger. She had often thought of hiding in the village from Bella and Stephan but she didn't want those two down in the town. She knew very well those two would have done something to insult the people merely because they were not wealthy. She didn't even want to consider what Gregory might have done. The village was fairly small but the people were kind and many of them worked at the castle. Looking down the hill Moanna could see Tania's house. It was bigger then she remembered but she guessed that was because there were more people living there now. .-. Moanna knocked on the door of the house and only moments later it was opened. A little girl with long orange hair and large green eyes stared up at her. \"Hello.\" Moanna said but before she could say anything else the girl turned around. \"Grandmamma!! There's a strange lady at the door!\" \"Oh hush child. I'm coming.\" An older woman with the same red hair as the girl's was walking over. Her hair however had some streaks of grey in it and she was wearing it in a bun. She was wearing a blue dress, as well as an apron with flour stains on it. \"Hello Tania.\" Moanna smiled. \"Moanna!\" Tania said seeing her at the door. \"I see you've met the littlest one. Say hello to Princess Moanna, Lorna.\" The little girl's eyes went even wider and she bowed. \"Hello.\" Smiling Moanna bowed as well. \"Hello Lorna. You look lovely.\" The girl smiled bashfully and hid behind her grandmother's skirt. \"I suppose you're here for the Queen's food, follow me my dear.\" Tania ushered Moanna into her kitchen. \"I'm in no hurry.\" Moanna said looking around the room. \"Well in that case you can wait till I finish this dough.\" Tania said cheerily as she put more flour on her hands. \"Pull up a stool.\" Grabbing a stool from the table on the far side of the room Moanna sat down to watch Tania begin to knead the dough. She was reminded greatly of her childhood when she would sometimes sneak into the kitchen to watch the people working. \"So my dear.\" Tania said. \"I heard I've been missing some drama up at yonder castle.\" Looking over she saw Moanna laughing. \"Well I call an engagement to a prince cut short a drama. Next time wait till I'm back up there. You're having all the excitement without me.\" \"I know Tania.\" Moanna laughed. \"Next time someone tries to kill me I'll hold off till you're there.\" Tania frowned. \"Now that is just wrong. What's our kingdom coming to when our own princess isn't safe?\" She gave the dough an extra hard punch. There was a pause. \"Are you coming back to the castle soon Tania?\" \"Once my daughter gets settled. That should take a couple of months at most. Just try to keep me away. I miss all the castle gossip.\" She held up a finger. \"Not that I myself ever participated in such acts.\" Moanna rolled her eyes. \"Of course not….you do realize that I know you right?\" \"Well you had better keep a civil tongue then missy. I've known you since you were a little tot.\" She chuckled. \"You used to hide in the kitchen from your math lessons. Never liked those much did you? I couldn't count the number of time that Faun had to come searching for you.\" Moanna blushed as she thought of that. Math had never been a strong point of interest to her. History at least sounded like a story if you told it the right way. .-. \"So you're not marrying that prince are you?\" Tania asked interested. \"Your father announced it then out of the blue it was called off.\" Moanna was glad she had already been blushing because she was sure that she would have started again. She hadn't known that her father had announced her betrothal. Embarrassing as that was she was glad that her father had also announced that the engagement was off. She wasn't sure that she wanted to have to correct people all the time. \"No, I'm not marrying that prince.\" Moanna said shaking her head out of her thoughts. \"Good.\" Tania said firmly as she put the dough away and wiped of her hands. \"I'm sure that the Faun would have hated that. Here you go.\" Tania pulled out a basket of baked food from a cupboard. \"Tell your mother it's much better then whatever rubbish that replacement cook's is feeding you people.\" She looked up to see Moanna staring at her. \"What is it Moanna?\" \"Did everyone know?\" Moanna exclaimed. Tania looked at her surprised. \"That you and the Faun are in love? Heavens child, of course we did. All the servants did, we thought it was adorable.\" She laughed at Moanna's expression. \"From the look on your face, I'd say you just figured this out recently.\" Moanna nodded slowly. \"Yes\" \"Good then.\" She pressed the basket of baked goods into Moanna's hands. \"I hope you realize that you can not get married till I get back to cooking. I'm putting my foot down there.\" Moanna, who had recently stopped blushing, felt her face light up again. \"I'll be sure to keep that in mind.\" \"I am sure you will. Now you go and give those to your mother with my best wishes.\" \"Thank you.\" Moanna replied. .-. On her way out of the house she saw the little girl playing with a doll on the floor. \"That's a pretty doll.\" Moanna said kindly walking over to the girl. \"What's her name?\" The girl didn't say anything and looked down at her hands. \"Ah, I see you've met Lorna's doll.\" Moanna looked to see Tania walking over to the girl. \"Go on Lorna. Tell her what you named your dolly.\" She smiled down at her granddaughter. The little girl looked up at Moanna shyly but didn't say anything. Tania chuckled and Moanna smiled. She placed the basket on the floor and kneeled down so she was level with Lorna. \"When I was your age I had a doll as well. Her name was Molly. I called her Molly the dolly and I used to have tea parties with her.\" Moanna smiled again when Lorna giggled. She liked this shy little girl. \"So what is your dolly named?\" Moanna asked again. \"Her name's Moanna.\" Lorna said to Moanna's own surprise. \"I named her after the princess…you!\" \"That's right.\" Tania said, rubbing Lorna's head affectionately. \"This little girl loves all the stories I've told her about the castle.\" \"Well then maybe you can come up sometime and visit me. Would you like that?\" Moanna asked Lorna, who nodded her head solemnly with wide eyes. \"I'll bring the little pipsqueak with me when I start cooking again.\" Tania replied. \"She can help me in the kitchens as well. Tell Moanna what you did yesterday.\" \"I helped make four bread.\" She displayed her fingers proudly. \"That's impressive.\" Moanna replied. \"Yup this ones going to be a great cook.\" She gazed down at her granddaughter with a proud look in her eyes. .-. Moanna was still smiling as she made her way up to the castle carrying the basket of food. She'd be glad when Tania was back. The kitchens weren't nearly the same without her. Lorna was a sweet girl and Moanna still thought it funny that the girl had named her doll after her. oOoOo Deciding the best thing to do would be to get rid of her load. Moanna went into the kitchen. After telling the news of Tania (all the rest of the servants were happy she was coming back soon) Moanna was stopped at the door of the kitchen. \"Princess Moanna.\" One of the servants addressed her. \"You are needed in the library?\" \"By who?\" Moanna asked curiously. \"I am not sure. It was a woman wearing a toga, I believe.\" \"Oh, well thank you.\" Moanna headed off to the library wondering why Seda wanted to see her. She should have been playing chess with Dr. Blightly still. Moanna didn't think that she'd been gone that long. .-. Inside the library Moanna found Seda sitting in a chair and reading. She looked up when she saw Moanna enter the room. \"Ah, Moanna.\" Seda smiled. \"I am glad I caught you.\" \"You wanted to see me Seda?\" Moanna asked curiously. There was a pause and Moanna could tell that Seda seemed a little uncertain of what she had been planning to say. However she quickly gathered herself together. \"Would you like to play a game of chess Moanna?\" \"I guess so. I'm not really that good.\" Moanna shrugged wondering if perhaps Seda had been planning on saying something else. She dismissed this thought. She was becoming far too suspicious for her own good. -- After two hours had passed Moanna was becoming very suspicious of Seda's actions. Every time she suggested that she should go check on her mother, Seda found something for them to do. It was almost like she was trying to distract her. \"Weren't you playing chess with Dr. Blightly?\" Moanna asked Seda, watching her expression carefully. \"He was busy.\" Seda responded lightly. \"And he asked me to keep you distracted for a couple of hours after you came back.\" She said this as though it was perfectly normal. \"Distracted from what?\" \"Oh, nothing.\" Seda waved her hand idly. \"You will find out later. I just happen to agree with the doctor. It's much better that you do not know yet.\" Moanna was extremely confused now but there didn't seem to be anything that she could do about it. So she went back to listening to Seda tell her stories. They had given up on the chess game a while back, as Moanna wasn't really that good of a player and Seda had beaten her in a few moves. This had been a better distraction for Moanna as she had always had a fondness for stories. .-. Another two hours had passed and Moanna was starting to feel restless. She wanted to go and check up on her mother. For some reason she felt the same sort of anxious feeling that she had when she was sitting outside her mother's room with the Captain, waiting to find out whether her mother would survive giving birth. She had no idea why she was feeling this way though. Surly someone would have told her if her mother was going into labor…wouldn't they? Moanna sighed, it was official. She was becoming paranoid. Just then however there was a noise at the door. Moanna looked over to see the same servant that had told her that Seda wanted to talk to her. He was leaning against the door catching his breath. \"Princess Moanna, your mother requests your presence.\" Moanna looked over at Seda who was smiling innocently. \"This had better not be what I think it is.\" \"Moanna, I am not sure what you are talking about.\" She thought over her last statement and then smirked. \"Well, I have to be going.\" Snapping her fingers she disappeared, leaving behind her usual amount of silver smoke. Moanna turned back to the messenger \"Where is my mother?\" \"She is in her room. The King is there also.\" He looked a little anxious \"It would probably be best if we were going now.\" Moanna looked at him suspiciously. If what she thought was true then some people would definitely have some explaining to do. She made note that Seda had appeared on the other end of the library. At least she knew where she was if she needed to find her. She sighed and turned back to the messenger \"Let's go then.\" … Hearing a baby's cry when Moanna was standing outside her mother's room looked angrily at the messenger \"She had her baby? Why did no one tell me she was going into labor?\" The messenger looked slightly embarrassed but simply replied. \"I do not know, my lady. I am merely the messenger. You will have to take that up with your mother. I believe it was her idea not to tell you.\" Moanna frowned as she thought of this. Seda and Dr. Blightly must have been in this as well. She wondered briefly if the Faun had known about this too but then she realized that the Faun was in the forest helping the fairies with something. She was glad she wasn't going to have to be mad at him. She walked cautiously into the room and saw her mother sitting in bed. \"Hello Moanna.\" The Queen said wearily. She was holding a baby wrapped in a blanket. \"Meet your new brother and sister.\" Moanna eyes widened as she saw the other baby in her fathers arms. He was sitting in a chair next to the Queen. She smiled at Moanna. \"Yes, you are a sister now.\" \"Are you alright mother?\" Moanna went over worriedly to look at her mother. \"Yes, I am fine.\" The Queen chuckled. \"Just a little tired that is all. Isn't the right doctor?\" Moanna looked over to see Dr. Blightly standing on the other side of the room. \"Do not worry Moanna. Your mother should be fine. She just needs some rest.\" Moanna felt a large surge of relief when she heard that. Now that her initial fear had subsided she went over to look at the two babies. \"What are their names?\" She asked in amazement, looking down at the babies. She couldn't believe that she was a sister. \"Your father is holding your sister Mari.\" The Queen said still smiling. \"I have your brother Tristan. Would you like to hold him?\" Moanna nodded and reverently took her brother out of her mother's hands. Looking down at the small child in her arms she felt a stab of remorse for the little brother she had left behind. One that she had only gotten to hold one time before she was killed. However before she could continue thinking such morbid thoughts the baby smiled up at her and made a small gurgling noise. She looked down and then a large smile came across her face. Her mother and father just smiled looking at their daughter holding her brother. They may have been royalty and Moanna might no longer be human but for that moment they were just like any normal, happy family. Such a pity that it couldn't last. oOoOo Moanna's mother thought that it would be for the best that Moanna didn't know she was going into labor because she thought her daughter would worry too much. He'd been surprised he'd been able to get Seda to distract Moanna. Though she had made it clear that she was only doing so because she agreed that Moanna not knowing was for the best. He had been forced to explain this all in great detail to Moanna after he had left the room and she had cornered him in the hallway. \"Very well.\" Moanna replied. \"But I still think someone should have told me.\" She was about to turn around but then thought better of it. \"Did the Faun know?\" Dr. Blightly shook his head. \"No…we could not be sure that he would not tell you. Besides he's still in the forest.\" Moanna shook her head but she was glad that the Faun wasn't in on the trick. \"Are you sure that my mother is going to be fine?\" Moanna decided to ask one last time to be sure. \"For the last time Moanna she'll be fine.\" Dr. Blightly said in a reassuring tone. \"The birth went well, there's no danger. There were no signs of infections and there was no risk of hypovolemic shock after the birth…\" He trailed off as Moanna looked at him strangely. \"She's fine.\" He repeated instead, deciding that he might as well emphasize that fact. \"It takes a lot to kill people down here.\" Moanna smiled. \"I'll stop asking then.\" \"I do not think repeating the question will change the answer.\" Moanna whirled around to see the Faun standing there. \"You have to stop doing that!\" Moanna said trying to act annoyed but ruining the affect when she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek. Dr. Blightly smiled then made an excuse to leave. The Faun watched him go then turned to Moanna. \"Lillandra was looking for you.\" Moanna rolled her eyes but smiled. The little fairy had gotten very attached to her since Moanna had healed her. .-. The Faun tilted his head questioningly. \"Do you have a brother or a sister now?\" \"Both actually.\" Moanna replied. \"Twins….wait!\" A thought struck her then and she smiled brightly while the Faun looked at her oddly. \"What is it Moanna?\" \"I just realized, now that I have a brother I can't be Queen at all.\" \"Ah, yes. I always thought that was a strange law.\" He paused. \"Though it does seem most beneficial for you now.\" \"Yes, it does.\" Moanna laughed. ….. The Faun and Moanna decided to go to see Seda in the library and tell her the news. Before, as the Faun had put it, Seda decided to appear in the Queen's room to check for herself. Seda was very pleased that the Queen was all right. Though, the Faun thought that it was probably more out of concern for Moanna then for the Queen. However he also thought it would be best if he didn't mention this fact. As he watched Moanna he wondered if Moanna knew what she was going to do with her future now that it was official she would no longer be Queen. He didn't know that Moanna was thinking the same thing all the while she was talking to Seda. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I hope you liked it! I actually did research on childbirth for this chapter. My most prominent findin g? I am never having a baby….ever….ever (If I ever do and I'm still writing fan fic's feel free to point out my hypocrisy) I must say that this chapter is more of a get the plot moving chapter then anything else. We'll be getting into some more interesting plot in the next chapter. Beware as we should be seeing everyone's least favorite character… (Well mine anyway).. Gregory. All the same I hope you liked it and will leave a review telling me what you thought![Chapter 17] Disclaimer- I do not own Pans Labyrinth and I never will A/N- Thank you so much for the reviews! You guys are the best. I hope you like this chapter. Please read, review and enjoy! Chapter Seventeen: Godparents A week had passed quickly and once the Queen was rested all the ceremonies began. It was something of a bore to Moanna but she passed the time getting to know her new bother and sister. As the boy, Tristan was now the heir and high prince, though he was still only a baby. This however tended to make the nobles of the court pay more attention to him. Moanna had read enough fairy tales and had enough commonsense to realize that growing up as the twin to the heir of a Kingdom was going to be difficult. So she made plans that she would spend just as much time (and maybe even a little more) with Mari. The last thing she wanted was for her little sister to end up like Bella. Someone who wanted power so much she would do anything to get it. This is why before the royal proclamation of the children's godparents Moanna made a slight suggestion. …. \"Well I must say I am sure that ceremony was much shorter when it was for Moanna.\" The King sighed as he sat down in a chair in the sitting room. He missed the look he'd received from the Queen. \"This one was longer because there are two babies this time.\" She emphasized the word two as she looked over at her daughter who was rolling her eyes. \"Well I'm sure that the Duke and Duchess will make wonderful godparents for your children.\" Dr. Blightly said. He was standing with Seda and the Faun near the door of the room. Seda really looked like she really didn't want to be there. (Moanna later found out that the only reason that Dr. Blightly had convinced Seda to come was that they'd made a wager in chess game and she'd lost.) \"Ah yes, the Duke and Duchess.\" The King smiled fondly. \"Yes, they will be fine godparents indeed. Though I think you must have missed something in my speech. Do not tell me you were not paying attention.\" The King was smiling as he said this as he was well aware that most people tended to drift in and out of consciousness during one of his speeches. Dr. Blightly merely shook his head amused. \"Well I may not have heard everything. May I ask what I am mistaken about?\" \"In my official announcement I only said that Tristan's godparents were the Duke and Duchess.\" Dr. Blightly looked confused. \"Yes, but surely as twins they will share the same godparents?\" The King nodded. \"Yes and so people will think. Though really, I have decided to give Mari quite different godparents from her brother. It was Moanna's idea actually. So if anyone in court finds fault in my decision they can blame her.\" He looked over at his daughter who was holding Mari and smiling. \"Don't try to pass the blame on me.\" She chuckled, acting offended. \"I only suggested it. You didn't have to do it.\" \"Oh just tell them.\" The Queen looked up from Tristan. \"I already know what it is and the suspense is still annoying me.\" \"Very well.\" The King replied and his voice suddenly became more serious. \"Dr.Blightly and Seda, would the two of you do us the very great honor of becoming Mari's godparents?\" The room fell into silence as both the Doctor and Seda looked amazed at the King. \"I would be honored.\" Dr. Blightly said his eyes still wide. \"Though if you forgive my intrusion Moanna. I thought you would suggest the Faun.\" The King chuckled. \"Well I could not have that. Since the Faun is most likely going to become part of this family another way...\" He trailed off as Moanna walked over and hit him on the shoulder, her face was bright red. \"Seda will you?\" Moanna decided to steer the conversation into a less embarrassing sphere. Seda stared at the ground then looked up curiously. \"What does being a godmother…entail exactly?\" \"It means that you'll look out for Mari when she's in trouble.\" The Queen replied. \"It's mostly a title that nobles receive but in your case it would mean a lot to us if you accepted. You have done so much for this family that I believe that you deserve some kind of remembrance.\" There was a pause and then something strange, something that very rarely happened, happened. Seda smiled. It wasn't a condescending smirk but real smile. \"I will then.\" oOoOo It was later that afternoon and Moanna was in the library with the Faun. She was flipping through an old book of poems. \"That was a kind thing you did for Seda.\" The Faun said, causing Moanna to look up from her book. \"It seems to me that she may soon have to stop hating all humans.\" Moanna smirked. \"Well, I hope she at least won't hate Mari.\" She put down the book. \"But I really think that it was a good idea. Mari is going to need someone to talk to as she grows up.\" The Faun tilted his head questioningly. \"And where will you be?\" Moanna bit her lip slightly but went on with her explanation. \"It's not that she won't be able to talk to me. It's just the fact that Tristan is my brother and I can not show too much favoritism. If Mari has Seda to talk to, someone not connected to her brother, I hope that she won't feel the need to…well to turn out like Bella.\" The Faun nodded, he understood her reasons now. \"Somehow I do not think that Mari will end up anything like your cousin. Moanna smiled and the room soon fell into a calm silence. It was calm for her at least. However the Faun was thinking deeply about something that the King had said. \"Moanna about what your father said….\" He trailed off as Moanna looked up at him with nervous eyes. There was another pause, this time awkward for the both of them. \"Moanna…\"The Faun looked like he was going to ask her something but was cut off by a knock on the door. Moanna frowned as she turned to find the castle messenger standing there. \"Don't tell me.\" Moanna called out with an amused tone. \"My mother has had another baby.\" The Messenger shook his head. \"If she has Princess, then she has not said anything. I was however sent to tell you that you have two visitors waiting for you in the main hallway.\" \"Do you know who they are?\" Moanna asked, dreading the reply. \"I believe it is the High Prince Gregory and his brother Prince Stephan. They came here to offer their congratulations to the Queen. They also expressed interest in seeing you and so the Queen sent me to find you.\" He paused and then reached into the pouch he carried and pulled out a piece of paper. \"The Queen also sends this note to you.\" Moanna took the note almost afraid it would read that she was going to be forced into a marriage to one of the prince's. She knew it was unlikely but with everything that had happened to her so far it wouldn't be that surprising. However the note simply read: Moanna The princes will be staying at the castle as our guests. Your father has explained to them that you will not be marrying either one of them. Try to be polite. Moanna sighed. \"Very well.\" She turned to see the Faun still standing by one of the library's desks. \"Will you come with me? I don't want to face them alone.\" The Faun smiled slightly and nodded. He was sure that the two princes would be not at all happy at his being there and he was glad to return the sentiments. He wouldn't trust either one of them around Moanna. He looked at her as they were walking down the hallway. He would sooner die then lose her. In the past few days he'd been so close to asking her but every time his will failed. The closest he'd gotten was today when they'd been interrupted. He would ask her though and as Seda had told him he'd better do it soon before some other unforeseeable event took place. oOoOo \"Ah Moanna what a lovely sight you are.\" Gregory said grandly as Moanna and the Faun entered the room. He'd made a point to ignore the Faun but was irritated when the creature seemed unaffected. \"I was told to be polite. Which is the only reason I am talking to you.\" Moanna said stiffly. \"I would much prefer if you were not here.\" \"I am sorry to hear that Moanna.\" Gregory said with false hurt tones. \"I was much hoping we could let bygones be bygones.\" Moanna didn't lose her stiff look. \"Well we can not. Is that all you wanted to speak to me about?\" \"My brother and I were rather hoping that we could see your brother and sister.\" Gregory replied. \"Though I'm sure if you do not wish to show them we could find them on our own.\" Moanna's eyes narrowed as she had heard a threat in the prince's last statement. \"If you dare do anything to them….\" She trailed off, too mad to speak properly. The Faun noticed that she was clutching her hands stiffly behind her back and that there seemed to be a light illuminating from them. The princes couldn't see this but it looked to the Faun that if pushed to much Moanna might still lose control of her powers. He walked over closer to her and put a comforting hand on her shoulder. Moanna seemed to relax with the Faun next to her and she glanced warily at her hands as she moved them in front of her to make sure that they were not glowing anymore. After all the lessons she'd been having, if she got angry there was always a risk that she would use her powers by accident. She took a couple of deep breaths and then continued talking. \"Very, well. I will show you my siblings.\" Gregory smirked while Stephan was looking rather nervous. He had in fact noticed Moanna's hands glowing. Remembering something Seda had said about teaching her he was rather starting to wonder if Moanna was going to become as frightening as Seda was. He didn't like that idea much, he was a prince and as so he wasn't supposed to scare easily. With that thought he hoped that Seda had left. It would be much easier to be brave when there wasn't someone with strange powers glaring at you all the time. He blinked as he realized he'd just described Moanna. Stephan sighed and his brother gave him an odd look. However he was used to Stephan's odd behavior and so ignored it as they continued to walk. … \"Here they are.\" Moanna said once they reached the nursery. She was glad to see that her mother was in the room as well. She was sure that even Gregory wasn't stupid enough to try something with the Queen there. \"Hello.\" The Queen greeted everyone. She smiled particularly at Moanna. Glad that her daughter was at least acting polite. \"I take it you have come to see the little ones.\" She turned to Gregory and Stephan as she said this. \"Yes, we would be most remiss if we did not come to see the new heir to the throne and his sister.\" Gregory replied grandly. Though if he had been hoping to gain a rise out of Moanna with the whole heir to the throne bit he would be disappointed as Moanna was paying him no attention. He shrugged briefly and then turned back to talking to the Queen. oOoOo The next day Moanna was surprised to receive a letter. It was even more surprising when, as she was reading it, she discovered that the letter was from her cousin. The letter said, much to Moanna's own amusement, that Bella's father was forcing her to write a letter of goodwill to Moanna on her becoming a sister. Bella had been sure to add that while she was writing the letter it was not her idea and Moanna shouldn't see it as a sign of friendship. Moanna actually laughed out loud at this part thinking that she was sure she didn't want to have a bond of any kind with Bella. However she did have to admit that the letter was amusing as Bella seemed to take more time writing about how she did not want to be writing this letter then anything else. There was also a postscript at the bottom asking if Moanna had rejected Gregory yet and if she had, would Moanna be kind enough to tell her because she personally wanted to spread the tale of high prince's failure. Moanna shook her head, amused at this. She wasn't sure if she would write back. On one hand, she didn't really want to have anything to do with Bella. On the other hand it would be a sort of revenge against Gregory if she told her cousin about how she had turned him down. With those thoughts in her mind Moanna decided that she would wait a couple of days or so and decide then. It wouldn't hurt to think about it anyway. ……. \"Can we go back home now?\" Stephan asked Gregory idly as he stared out of the window in the room they were staying in. Gregory was slouching in a chair with some papers. \"Of course not. The plan is working perfectly.\" \"You know, I do not think you are really here for revenge.\" Stephan said watching his brother glare at him. \"Father sent you here to discuss things with the King.\" Gregory rolled his eyes. \"Or maybe that is what I am using to hide my plans for revenge.\" \"But we have been here for three days and you have not done anything yet!\" Stephan protested. Angered by the condescending tone Gregory was using. Wearily Gregory sighed mentally kicking himself for thinking that his brother would ever be any help to him. \"Are you aware there is a term called, a false sense of security?\" He shook his head. \"Well that is precisely what I am doing to Moanna. She will be off her guard when I strike.\" There was a short pause as Stephan resisted the urge to take a leaf out of Bella's book and throw something at his brother's head. \"Well then can I leave? I told you before I want no part of this.\" \"And I told you, you will do what I tell you to do. I am the older brother here and as such, my word is law.\" Stephan sighed and went back to staring out the window. He hated his brother when he was like this. This unfortunately for him was almost all the time. \"Here make yourself useful. Sort these papers for me.\" Gregory got up and threw a folder of papers into Stephan's lap. \"I am meeting with the King.\" \"Fine.\" Stephan sighed. Glad that he at least had something to take his mind off of what was going on. He never thought he'd ever miss Bella but now he wished she was here instead of his brother. His parents wouldn't get mad at him if he didn't pay attention to her. …. Moanna was indulging herself in one of her bad habits. She was wandering around the castle with her nose in a book. However her luck was much better it seemed as she hadn't run into anyone yet. Unfortunately that string of good luck was broken when she turned the next corner. \"Watch where you are going.\" A voice said angrily and Moanna looked over to see she had bumped into Gregory. She rolled her eyes. \"I am sorry.\" She said this in such a flat voice it had no real meaning. \"You should be.\" Gregory said in an arrogant voice while dusting himself off. \"I am much more important than you, you know. I am heir to a throne and you are barely a princess.\" \"I am heartbroken.\" Moanna replied in the same toneless voice. \"I may not be in line for the throne anymore but I do not care.\" \"That it good for you then is it not.\" Moanna glared at the prince. \"Why are you here?\" Gregory laughed. \"I am here because my father sent me to talk to the King about matters…you wouldn't understand.\" \"I don't trust you.\" Moanna said warily. \"You said you would get revenge but you have been here a week and still you have tried nothing.\" Gregory smirked. \"Maybe I changed my mind. You are not worth getting revenge over.\" With that he walked off and Moanna was sorely tested to throw the book she was carrying at his retreating form. Somehow she still didn't believe him about not wanting revenge. He was too proud. With that thought in mind Moanna went and wrote a letter to her cousin. oOoOo Moanna was sitting in her room looking over the letter she was thinking about sending to Bella. There was a knock on the door and Moanna looked up. \"Come in.\" \"Hello Moanna. What is it you are doing?\" She smiled when she saw it was the Faun. \"I'm trying to decide whether or not I should send this letter I wrote to Bella.\" The Faun looked at her questionably. \"Why would you send your cousin a letter?\" Moanna told him about the letter that Bella had sent her. \"And you wish to keep in contact with your cousin?\" Moanna paused. \"Not especially. I just thought that it would be amusing to tell her about Gregory. She seems to hate him even more then she hates me.\" The Faun looked at Moanna with a trace of amusement. She spoke about someone hating her as though it was a normal thing. He smiled slightly as Moanna took another glance over her letter. \"Well send the letter if you wish.\" Moanna smiled. \"I think Seda is rubbing off on me. I'm starting to think like her.\" \"We should be worried then.\" Moanna looked over to see the Faun smiling. She just shook her head amused. \"I think I should be insulted.\" Both looked over to see Seda standing in the doorway \"You'd be insulted even if we hadn't said anything.\" Moanna laughed. She had grown close to Seda since she known her. The woman, despite her outward hostility, loved to laugh. \"Do you have any news for me?\" Seda asked looking pointedly from between the Faun and Moanna. \"No, should we?\" Moanna asked, slightly confused. Seda looked rather irritated but she just replied. \"No I was merely wondering.\" She looked out of the door. \"Oh there is Dr.Blightly. Which reminds me, he lost our last chess game.\" With that strange statement Seda left the room quickly. Moanna's brow furrowed as she said with some amusement. \"Maybe we should be worried I'm becoming like her.\" She shook her head as she turned to the Faun. \"Did you understand a word of that?\" The Faun shook his head slightly. \"I am not sure about the last bit about the chess game. Though I do think that Dr. Blightly had better be careful about what they wager in those games of theirs.\" \"That would be for the best.\" Moanna agreed laughing. There was a pause and Moanna took another look at the letter in her lap. \"You know, I think I will send this letter. Bella will get a laugh out of my rejection of Gregory. I know I shouldn't want her to laugh but I feel that Bella has reason enough to hate Gregory.\" There was pause in the conversation as Moanna took another look at the page. The Faun however was looking over at her. \"Moanna?…..\" As Moanna looked up she felt the strangest sensation of déjà vu. When the Faun paused she looked over to the door half expecting to see that blasted messenger again. However the doorway was empty and she looked back at the Faun. \"Moanna.\" The Faun started again. \"I am not quite sure how to say this….I love you.\" Moanna looked at him oddly but lovingly. \"I know I love you too.\" The Faun however held up a finger. \"Moanna….I know that this is not the grandest proposal you have received but I mean it from my heart. Moanna will you marry me?\" Whatever Moanna had been expecting, that had not been it. Her eyes went wide and she was left speechless. There was a pause while the Faun looked uncertainly at her. His hope grew however when he saw Moanna start to smile. \"I will.\" Moanna said with tears of happiness in the corners of her eyes. The Faun, through all his hope could scarcely believe what Moanna had said. \"You will?\" \"Yes, I will.\" Moanna had gotten up from her seat and was standing in front of the Faun. The Faun looked down at Moanna, smiling up at him. \"I love you.\" The Faun leaned his head down and kissed Moanna deeply. After, Moanna told him something that made him smile. \"That by far was the grandest proposal I have ever had the pleasure of receiving.\" \"I hope you realize that I will not allow you to receive anymore.\" The Faun said lightly. \"Of course.\" Moanna said teasingly. \"I would expect nothing less. Though perhaps you should give me another kiss, just to make sure I won't.\" As they kissed again, Moanna wondered if she had ever been so happy in her entire life. -------------------------- A/N – And that's the end of that chapter… I think I mentioned that this might be the last chapter of the story…well I was wrong…. I wrote the romantic bits of this while watching Pride and Prejudice on tv. I think it inspired me. Though, if Mr. Darcy somehow found his way in there... I claim my innocence :) I hope you liked it so please remember to leave a review and tell me what you think![Chapter 18] Disclaimer- Again I do not own Pans Labyrinth A/N- Okay first of all March was a horribly frantic month for me and I'm extremely, extremely sorry about the delay of this chapter. However I hope you like it and leave a review telling me what you thought….enjoy! Chapter Eighteen: A Castle Tour Moanna's parents were pretending to be surprised when they heard the announcement though, really they had been expecting it for quite some time. The Queen was the happier of the two but even the King couldn't help but smile at the news. They knew very well that their daughter would be looked after and loved by the Faun. Something, which they had been worrying about lately when they talked about Moanna's future. Though they knew that the news would most likely have been leaked into the local townspeople's ears the next day by the servants, they decided to wait until their guests left before announcing it formally to the rest of their land. This plan unfortunately, seemed to have a large flaw in it though, and that was that Gregory and Stephan showed no inclination to leaving. They had been there for a week and they still showed no signs of returning home. This may not have seemed unusual as many royal people spent long lengths of time staying with other royal families if they weren't ruling their own kingdoms at the time. However it was certainly odd for this kingdom. They had gone from rarely having guests to wondering if said guests would ever leave. It was a strange change for everyone and the King and Queen tried to go about their business of running the land, not thinking about it. In fact there was really only one person who was really worried about Gregory and that was Moanna. That was only because she knew there had to be a reason for him to be there. A real reason that was, not the fake one about his father wanting him and his brother to learn more about other kingdoms. No she knew he was up to something and it was starting to worry her that she couldn't figure out what it was. Seda and the Faun however didn't say much about the matter, as both of them could be seen as rather biased. The Faun against both Gregory and Stephan and though Seda was as well her reasons were more to do with the fact that they were humans, more then anything else. Dr. Blightly was a naturally optimistic man, which was why at the moment he was trying to convince Moanna that there really might be a reason for why the princes were here that didn't involve revenge. - \"I don't believe it.\" Moanna replied, sitting on a stool in the doctor's room with her arms folded against her chest. \"Of course you don't.\" Dr. Blightly replied from behind his desk. \"And I quite agree that you have every reason not to.\" \"Then why do you keep trying to tell me otherwise?\" Moanna asked, throwing up her hands, exasperated. Dr. Blightly smiled as he flipped through some papers. \"Well someone has to remind you once in awhile otherwise you are liable to do something foolish.\" \"Thank you for your confidence.\" Moanna replied with a slight sarcastic tone to her voice and Dr. Blightly chuckled. \"I'm not saying that you will do anything but it never hurts to give a warning.\" \"I know. I know.\" Moanna said with a wave of her hand. \"I don't have any plans to do anything either. I haven't spent nearly enough time with Seda for that.\" Dr. Blightly chuckled at this and shook his head with amusement. \"Good, I was starting to worry.\" \"You're the one playing chess with her all the time.\" Moanna replied with an ironic smile. \"But I'm sure you have your reasons.\" She got up off the stool. \"I have to go see if Tania is in the kitchens yet.\" \"Oh is she coming back today?\" Dr. Blightly asked looking over and Moanna nodded. \"Yes, her daughter and son in-law are all settled in now.\" \"Well that's good then. Tell her I'm glad she's back, won't you.\" Moanna nodded as she left the room. \"Of course.\" oOoOo When she reached the kitchens Moanna was glad to find that she hadn't run into either Stephan or Gregory the entire way there. It seemed like every where she turned she was running into them these days, something that only fuelled her suspicions about them. Walking into the kitchens the first thing Moanna heard was Tania's voice and she smiled. It was just like back when she was little and had snuck into the kitchen, Tania was always the loudest one there as she gave out her orders. Moanna walked over to where Tania was just finishing talking to a junior chef, Moanna hoped it wasn't the poor woman that had been left in charge when Tania left because she knew that Tania viewed that woman as a threat to her territory. When the two of them saw Moanna the woman smiled and did a nervous curtsy before running off. Watching the woman nearly collide with someone carrying a jug of milk, Tania sighed. \"You really can not get good help around here anymore.\" She smiled though and Moanna knew she didn't really mean it. Aside from the woman she had branded an interloper; Tania was fiercely mothering and proud of all who worked under her. \"Ah that's right.\" Tania said with a snap of her fingers. \"I was wondering if you weren't too busy Moanna, if you would give the little one a show around the castle.\" She nodded her head to the right and Moanna looked to see the little girl Lorna standing there. Her eyes as wide as ever and clutching on to her rag doll as though it was going to be snatched out of her arms at any moment. \"This busy kitchen is a bit scary for the mite.\" Tania said. \"I thought it would be best if she was out of here for awhile.\" Moanna smiled kindly at the little girl. \"Of course, I'd love to.\" \"Now you be good for the princess.\" Tania said, ushering Lorna over to Moanna, the former still looking rather petrified. However once Moanna held out her hand the little girl grasped that quickly and hung on to Moanna. \"Come on Lorna, I'll give you the grand tour of the castle.\" Moanna said gently looking down at the shy little girl. \"I'll even show you.\" She leaned down to whisper in a conspiratorial voice. \"Some secret rooms, would you like that?\" Lorna nodded, eagerly and a smile appeared on her face. Moanna smiled at this as well as she and Lorna walked out of the kitchen, the little girl still holding her firmly by the hand. -- She wasn't really that sure what to show Lorna first but after telling her about the secret rooms Moanna decided to show her the one on the third floor first. \"It's my favorite one.\" She confided to the small girl. \"But remember, you can't tell anyone about it.\" \"Not, even Grandmamma?\" The little girl breathed nervously, making Moanna almost jump from fright. The little girl hadn't said anything up to that point since she had first seen her at her house but she smiled quickly. \"No, you can tell her, she already knows about it. Just make sure not to tell anyone else.\" Lorna nodded solemnly as the two reached the third floor. Moanna quietly made sure that there was no one else there and showed the little girl how to open the secret door, the little girl was suitably impressed with this. \"Wow!\" She gasped looking around and clutching her doll tighter. \"We're in the wall!\" Moanna was glad that the girl was starting to get more comfortable in her presence and smiled even more at the girls wonder. \"Yes, it's really neat, isn't it?\" Lorna nodded again and she went to look around the room. Moanna watched the girl run around exploring and couldn't help but tilt her head to the side and sigh. She was so engaged watching the girl run around that she didn't notice the Faun come up behind her until she turned to find him standing there. He smiled as the surprised expression on her face turned to annoyance then a smile. He always did enjoy coming up behind her. Moanna shook her head with amusement and then leaned up to kiss him on the cheek, she was still amazed that she could do this now. Lorna had heard the Faun come in and as she turned to see him her eyes went wide and she clutched her doll tightly. Moanna saw that the Faun had noticed this, and shook her head. \"Don't mind her, she's just very shy.\" The Faun nodded as Moanna walked over to Lorna. She took the little girl by the hand and walked her closer to the Faun, all the while talking to her. \"You don't have to be scared of him, he's a very special friend of mine.\" The little girl looked up at the Faun when they reached, still a little nervous and holding onto Moanna's arm. However when she saw that the Faun wasn't so frightening when you got closer to him, she held up her doll shyly. \"This is my dolly.\" She proclaimed proudly. \"I named her Moanna.\" The Faun looked over at Moanna with a wry smile and Moanna chuckled. \"Yes, I was lucky enough to have a doll named after me. Now Lorna, why don't we go explore some more?\" Lorna nodded eagerly with a wide smile on her face and soon all three of them were out of the secret room. \"Lorna may like to see your new brother and sister.\" The Faun suggested in the hallway. Moanna looked over at the little girl who nodded her agreement. She smiled, \"That sounds like a good idea.\" She looked over at the Faun. \"Would you like to come with us?\" \"I would but I am afraid I can not at the moment.\" The Faun said with a nod of his head. \"Very well then.\" Moanna said, turning to Lorna and taking the little girl's hand again. oOoOo Very soon they had reached the nursery and once inside Moanna explained to the nurse that they were just visiting the twins. The nurse was a matronly woman in her late forties dressed in a crisp white apron and had blonde hair tied back in a practical bun. She was quite willing to let them in and was quite happy fussing over Lorna as well. Lorna loved seeing the babies and was over by the nurse when Moanna looked out the doorway to see Gregory looking in. \"What do you want?\" She said stiffly, though trying not to be too rude. Gregory smirked however and walked into the room. \"I was just looking in.\" He said idly looking around the room, specificly over where the twins were. \"Making sure that the children are all right and all that. It would be such a shame if anything was to happen to them, wouldn't it?\" He let his question trail of as Moanna whirled around to face him her eyes glinting with rage. \"Don't you dare, lay a finger on them.\" She glared and he just shrugged. \"Now Moanna, why would I do that? Surely you don't think I'm going through all this trouble just to get back at you, do you?\" He said this as though it were the most unimaginable thing in the world and Moanna's frown deepened. \"You had better not….\" She trailed off and turned away from him, looking over at her brother and sister. \"You haven't been in contact with your cousin have you?\" Gregory asked, causing Moanna to look over at him. \"Which cousin?' She asked in a sweet voice, smiling as he frowned, clearly annoyed. \"You know who I mean.\" Gregory said in an irritated voice but when Moanna didn't say anything he continued. \"Bella, your cousin Bella, have you been in contact with her?\" Moanna paused as though taking a while to think over this question but was really just trying to annoy Gregory. \"I am writing her a letter.\" She said after the pause. \"But I haven't sent it yet.\" She looked over dryly to see Gregory was looking slightly less annoyed, something else that made her a little worried. However this irritation was cut short by Lorna pulling on the sleeve of Moanna's dress. She looked down at the little girl who smiled up at her and had to smile herself. However this was quickly turned into a glare when Gregory made a comment as he also looked at the girl. \"I don't suppose this is your child. She looks too normal to be a child of that faun creature.\" Moanna raised her hand to slap him but he caught her hand before it hit. There was a dangerous look on his face and he said in a smooth tone. \"I would not suggest that you do that.\" He dropped her hand with a sneer. He took another look at Lorna and then glanced over at the twins cribs. \"Take care.\" He left the room after that, leaving Moanna glaring after him. \"I don't like him.\" Lorna said after a moment, breaking the silence. Moanna laughed at this sudden outburst from the little girl. \"I don't either.\" She said patting the girl on her shoulder. \"Shall we go and look at the rest of the castle now?\" Lorna nodded and grabbed Moanna's hand again. oOoOo Dr. Blightly was still in his office flipping though some books and making some notes on poisons when Seda walked in. \"Do you know where Moanna is?\" She asked, leaning against the doorway. \"I heard that she is giving the cook's granddaughter a tour of the castle.\" Dr. Blightly said after a moment of thought. Seda gave him an odd look. \"That sounds odd…but knowing Moanna, not all that surprising.\" Dr. Blightly nodded in agreement. \"Well I'm sure she's somewhere in the castle.\" Seda shrugged, \"I was just going to ask her if she was still coming to our lesson tomorrow.\" \"Why wouldn't she?\" The doctor asked looking over. \"I heard there was some type of celebration going on in the city.\" Dr. Blightly thought for a moment. \"Ah, yes, there is a festival in Morvoi, I believe that most people will be going to it.\" \"Do you know if Moanna is going to go?\" Seda asked. \"She might but I'm not sure.\" Seda stood up, \"well I had better go and find her then.\" Dr. Blightly nodded. \"Good luck.\" He watched Seda leave the room and then went back to making his notes. -- Seda was walking outside in the gardens when she came upon Moanna. \"There appears to be a little girl attached to your leg.\" She commented looking down at the small girl clinging to Moanna. Moanna smiled, \"This is the Tania's daughter Lorna.\" She then came down to Lorna's level. \"This is my friend Seda.\" The little girl eyes grew less wide when she heard that Moanna knew the person. Moanna stood up. \"Were you looking for me Seda?\" Seda nodded, \"I was wondering if you were going to the festival tomorrow.\" Moanna shook her head. \"I'm staying here with the twins. I've been talking with their nurse a lot and I'm going to look after the twins for her so she can go to the festival with her family.\" Seda nodded, \"I will drop by then tomorrow to see if you have time for a lesson.\" She looked down at Lorna and smiled. \"Good bye Lorna.\" She disappeared in a flash of silver smoke and after she'd gone Lorna looked up at Moanna in amazement. Moanna just shook her head with a smile. \"She's a little….dramatic….\" She tried to explain this to the little girl who had probably never seen magic before. She tried again, \"Have you ever heard of the lady of the forests?\" Lorna's eyes got even wider. \"That was her?\" She breathed in amazement and Moanna nodded. \"She's a lot nicer then the stories say.\" Moanna reassured the small girl, now that she remembered what the stories were like. Lorna still looked a little nervous. \"Let's keep walking.\" Moanna suggested and the girl nodded. Neither one of them noticed someone watching them from a window of the castle as they walked. oOoOo The next day Moanna was trying to convince her mother that she really should be able to stay home from the festival. \"I don't see why I can not Mother.\" Moanna said trying to keep the frustration from her voice. \"You are going to miss the entire festival. I always thought that you enjoyed going.\" The Queen had a sad expression on her face. \"Well I already told the twin's nurse that I would look after them for her.\" Moanna looked at her feet. \"And I don't really want to be on display just yet.\" She knew she would be later but right now she'd rather avoid the large crowds. The queen sighed. \"Very well Moanna, if I can not convince you to come.\" She shook her head. \"I hope you will be more willing to come to another event.\" Moanna nodded. \"I will mother.\" \"Well, there will only be a few people left in the castle so you will have some quiet in the very lest.\" The queen hugged her daughter. \"I am sure you will be a very good stand in nurse for your brother and sister.\" \"I hope so.\" Moanna agreed and then watched as her mother left the room. She was glad that her mother was letting her stay. She hadn't been certain that she would have been allowed to. She was just thinking this over when she heard a knock on her door. She looked over to see Stephan standing there. This was surprising as he had seemed to be avoiding her ever since he'd arrived with his brother. Something she'd been very grateful for. \"Yes?\" Moanna said when she saw that Stephan was just standing there. \"Ah, yes.\" Stephan coughed. \"Are you going to the festival today?\" Moanna shook her head. \"No, I am not.\" \"Oh…\" Stephan trailed off and Moanna looked over at him, waiting for him to leave. \"Well….\" Stephan said, \"I am going.\" He said this in such an odd voice that Moanna looked at him suspiciously. \"What are you talking about?\" \"I was just saying.\" Moanna rolled her eyes. \"Stephan, I don't want to be rude but I really don't care if you're going.\" Stephan looked at the ground. \"Well I just had to ask.\" He scratched his head and looked like he was going to say something. However he suddenly turned and walked away. Moanna watched him go, confusion on her face as she wondered what had just happened. However the queen appeared at the door at that moment so she really didn't have much time to think about it. \"We are leaving now Moanna. The city is not that far away so your father and I will be back by tonight.\" Moanna nodded and got up from the chair she'd been sitting on. She knew she wasn't ever going to be completely alone as because she was part of the royal family and so there were always guards somewhere in the castle. However she was as close as she would probably ever be so she was determined to enjoy it. The twins were asleep at the moment and so Moanna decided to go and walk around the castle. - It was a few hours later when Moanna was checking in on the twins again. She smiled as she watched them. She was still amazed watching them as they slept, they looked so tiny. After making sure they were all right she decided to go and talk to Dr. Blightly she knew he was staying in the castle as well. As she walked down the hallway however her attention was caught by the sudden appearance of Gregory. \"Moanna, just the former princess I was looking for.\" He smirked and Moanna frowned at him. \"I thought you were going to the festival?\" Moanna asked irritated. She had been so sure that he was going; it was even one of her own reason for staying. \"And miss spending some quality time with you, never.\" He put an arm around her shoulder. \"Moanna, I think we need to have a little chat.\" He pulled her into the nursery as Moanna tried to pry his arm off her shoulder. \"Let me go Gregory.\" She said in a low voice, trying not to wake up Mari or Tristan. \"No, I think we need to have a little talk about something.\" \"Can we talk about it somewhere else then?\" \"Worried about your little brother and sister Moanna? What do you think I would do to them?\" He walked over to Tristan's crib and Moanna's eyes seemed to flash. \"Stay away from him.\" She growled and watched in disbelief as Gregory slowly picked up Tristan. \"Cute little high prince.\" Gregory said. \"Such a pity that he had to have a sister that was so unreasonable.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Moanna said, suddenly getting very nervous. \"You really should have taken me up on my offer. You know I can not let you get away with turning me down for such a creature as the Faun. I do have something of a reputation to uphold.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Gregory smiled nastily. \"You think you are safe now that you have a brother to grow up to be King. With him you do not have to worry about the fact that you are not human and can not rule anyway. However, if something were to happen to your brother then you would find yourself in a rather pressing predicament. It would be a little hard to explain to your people why you could not rule.\" \"Nothing is going to happen to my brother.\" Moanna said with a glare. \"And I do have a sister, Mari could rule.\" \"Not if something happened to her as well.\" Gregory threw back at her. \"Leave them alone. You're mad at me not them.\" Gregory sighed. \"I know Moanna, but it is so much more effective to get you through your brother and sister.\" He pulled something out of his belt. \"What do you think you are doing?\" Moanna gasped, seeing a long dagger in the prince's hand. \"What does it look like?\" He was holding Tristan in one hand and the dagger idly in his other hand. \"Don't you dare!\" Moanna yelled and made to grab her brother away. However she was suddenly grabbed from behind. She looked back to see Stephan holding onto her arms. \"You won't get away with this.\" Moanna snapped, struggling to get out of Stephan's grasp. \"I will though.\" Gregory replied. \"And if you think you may get help let me put your mind at rest. That doctor friend of yours is a little busy attempting to get out of the locked room Stephan left him in.\" \"Seda is coming today.\" Moanna said angrily, \"and you don't want her to get mad at you.\" Gregory laughed. \"Oh, I think that right now she has something else more pressing on her mind. That Faun of yours as well, would you care to see?\" He indicated for Stephan to take Moanna over to the window. He did so and Moanna had to wait a moment as he drew back the curtain all the while trying to keep a hold of her. However Moanna was almost grateful he had a grip on her as she looked out the window because if she hadn't had anything to support herself she surely would have fallen. Her eyes were wide and she gasped in shock. \"How could you, you monster!\" She tried even harder to break out of Stephan's grasp but she wasn't strong enough. She closed her eyes not wanting to see the horrid sight that was outside the window. Gregory had done perhaps the one thing that would have both the Faun and Seda drawn out of the castle, too distracted to think about Moanna at all. He had set the forest on fire. I really hope you liked it and again sorry for the wait. Please remember to review![Chapter 19] Desclaimer- Pans Labyrinth…If I owned it do you really think I'd still be suffering through Math 12?….I didn't think so. A/N- Thank you for all the reviews guys! From all of them I can see that you all hate Gregory, I will warn you….he gets worse…..much worse. No really, I am expecting death threats. But aside from that, please read, review and enjoy! Chapter Nineteen- The Pot Bubbles Over As Dr. Blightly came to, he realized that something was very wrong. The first clue he had was the fact that he was locked in his office. The second was the rather strong smell of smoke that was coming from the window. He got up hastily when he realized that the smell of smoke was real and not just a side effect of being knocked unconscious. Walking as quickly as he could to the window, he rubbed his eyes and stared. There was a large plume of smoke billowing up from the forest. A very large plume of smoke. Opening the window he coughed as some of the smoke rushed in. However he ignored this as he tried to get a good view of what was happening through the smoke. As Dr. Blightly looked through the haze he could have sworn that he saw Seda running towards the fire. He tried to call her name but as he did so he inhaled a lungful of smoke from the window. He had to pull his head back in as the smoke started to choke him. However Seda must have heard him because in a flash of silver smoke he was standing out in the hallway with Seda standing directly in front of him. He almost took a step backwards when he saw the expression on Seda's face. She looked furious and her eyes seemed to be drilling a hole into him. In fact there seemed to be a fiery glint burning deep in her eyes. \"What's going on?\" He asked quickly and she seemed to break herself out of a daze. \"The forest's on fire.\" Seda replied quickly in an urgent tone of voice that Dr. Blightly had never heard her use before. \"I need you to go down to the village to see if there is anyone there that can help put it out.\" Dr. Blightly's eye's widened slightly; it really was trouble if Seda was stooping herself to ask humans for help. \"What are you going to do?\" He asked as she turned to disappear, but looked back at him. \"I'm going to try to put it out.\" Seda replied and before Dr. Blightly could ask anything else she disappeared. Dr. Blightly stood staring before he realized what he was supposed to be doing and started quickly towards the village. He didn't know how many people were there though as most would have gone to the festival. He just hoped he'd be able to find enough. oOoOo Moanna stared out the window in absolute shock. \"How could you?\" She gasped. \"Do you know how many creatures live in that forest? They could all die because of you!\" Gregory smirked and shrugged in indifference. \"I happened to need a distraction. A rather big distraction, as it were.\" Moanna shook her head, he was so self centered he couldn't see how many creatures might die just for his stupid revenge. She tried to address Stephan as he held her arms behind her back, hoping he might be more reasonable then his brother. \"Stephan.\" She tried but was cut off by Gregory. \"He's not going to listen to you Moanna. He knows that if he doesn't do exactly what I say I'll kill him.\" Moanna glared over. \"You'd kill your own brother….\" She trailed off knowing full well he would. Gregory saw this realization on Moanna's face and chuckled. \"Yes Moanna, you really did make a mistake.\" He brought the dagger a little closer to Tristan, watching Moanna the entire time. She tried vehemently to break away from Stephan but again failed. At this last failure she seemed to deflate a bit. Tears came to the corners of her eyes. \"Please don't kill my brother.\" She said in a quiet defeated voice and Gregory laughed. After Gregory had finished laughing he looked at Moanna with a condescending look on his face. \"Don't kill your brother Moanna?\" He said as she looked at him. \"Let us say I did not, would you prefer me to kill you instead. One life for that of your brother and sister?\" Moanna nodded hastily, she would easily give her life for that of her brother and sister. \"Yes.\" Gregory however just smirked. \"Somehow I thought you might say that. But really Moanna I just do not see how killing you is better then killing your brother and sister. However…..\" He trailed off and then shook his head; crushing any hope that Moanna would have had that he was going to change his mind. \"No, this way is far more amusing, don't you see Moanna.\" He said while she glared at him. \"This way not only do you have to watch your brother and sister die you are most likely going to be blamed for killing them.\" He chuckled. \"Oh the irony in that is simply marvelous. He suddenly moved the dagger closer and Moanna gasped. \"Don't please. I'll do anything you want just don't hurt them.\" She was crying now but she didn't even notice as rage seemed to flood through her. - However Stephan did as he looked over at Gregory. \"Gregory maybe we're going too far. You just said you were going to scare her. You know I hate to see a woman cry.\" \"Then don't look at her you knight.\" Gregory snapped, making it clear that this was an insult. \"This is your fault anyway. If you hadn't failed to get her to marry you then none of this would have happened!\" \"You mean if you hadn't been so obsessed about getting revenge this wouldn't have happened.\" Stephan seemed to be getting angrier and while he was distracted his grip on Moanna loosened. Quickly before he could get his grip back Moanna managed to wrench herself out of his grasp. She quickly ran to the opposite side of the room next to Mari's crib and stood in front of it defensively. \"Oh so you think that now that you are away from Stephan you can save your siblings? Well I do have news for you Moanna. I am holding your brother.\" He looked over at her with an evil look on his face. \"And I am going to kill him, no matter what you do. Grab her Stephan.\" However just as he said this, Moanna happened to look behind him out the window. The first thing she noticed sent a thrill of hope through her. A raindrop was falling, it was raining and that would put the fire out. This would save the forest but it would do nothing to save her brother and so Moanna quickly wrenched her gaze from it before Gregory would notice. He however didn't seem to as he was now glaring daggers at Stephan. \"What did you say? I told you to grab her!\" \"And I said no.\" Stephan replied crossing his arms. \"For the last year I have been doing whatever either you or Bella wanted me to do. I have hurt people and I almost killed someone all for your stupid plan. I am not going to help you commit murder.\" \"You will listen to me.\" Gregory said, pointing his dagger over at Stephan instead of the baby in his arms. His grasp on the dagger was shaking as though he was starting to doubt himself. Moanna was just about to make a dash for Tristan when Stephan beat her to it. He ran forwards and tried to grab the dagger out of his brother hands. However his brother acted quicker and before Moanna knew what had happened Stephan was on the floor with a heavily bleeding side wound. - Gregory was staring at the bloody dagger in his hand as though it had just appeared there. Moanna took the opportunity to quickly grab Tristan out of Gregory's arms before he dropped him. Once she had her brother safely in her arms she retreated back to her stance in front of Mari's crib where she could try to protect both of them if Gregory suddenly attacked. However Gregory seemed to be still in a daze, staring at his brother on the ground. She glanced over at Stephan as well, she wasn't sure what to do. She might be able to heal him but she didn't trust Gregory enough to leave Tristan and Mari in their cribs. He'd just been threatening to kill them a moment ago and he'd just stabbed his own brother. Gregory however seemed to sense that she was looking at him. \"I told him to do what I said.\" He said, eyes angry and defensive and Moanna was startled to see that he looked terrified \"He should have listened to me!\" Moanna tried to back up but realized that she didn't have anywhere else to go. Gregory wasn't doing anything but staring at his brother and Moanna wondered if she dare risk it. However as she took another glance at Stephan on the ground bleeding she realized that as horrible as he'd been, she didn't want him dead. This was why very carefully Moanna placed Tristan in with Mari, in her crib. She was relived to find that when she turned around Gregory was back to staring at the dagger in his hand. \"Give me the dagger and I'll try to help your brother.\" Moanna said holding her hand. Gregory looked over at her but then nodded blankly and handed her the bloody dagger. Moanna took the knife carefully and then with another sharp look at Gregory said stiffly. \"Go over and stand by the door. I don't want you near me or my siblings.\" Gregory backed off and it wasn't before this that Moanna got down on her knees to look at Stephan. She wasn't a doctor but she was hopeful that she would be able to heal the damage that was there. Seda had been teaching her to control her power so with some hope she placed her palms down on Stephan's chest and she concentrated. . A blue haze surrounded Stephan as Moanna was concentrating and Gregory just watched in amazement. This entire plan was working perfectly, true he could not reach Moanna's brother or sister with her blocking the way but she was concentrating so much on saving his idiot of a brother that she wasn't paying attention to him. This was way she didn't notice as Gregory pulled another dagger out a pocket on the inside of his jerkin. oOoOo Moanna's concentration was suddenly broken from her healing by a large agonizing shot of pain in her shoulder. She looked over and found that the pain was caused by the fact that there was a dagger in shoulder. \"Well now that you seem to be down for a while there's nothing to stop me from killing your siblings.\" She looked up when Gregory said this to see that he had picked up the dagger that he had stabbed Stephan with and she was struck by how similar he was at that moment to the Captain, her old step father and the man who had killed her. As she thought of this she felt a tremendous burst of will power. She would not die again and she would not let anything happen to either Tristan or Mari. So with a large concentrated effort she managed to pull the dagger out of her shoulder and get shakily to her feet. Gregory however didn't much notice of her, he clearly didn't think of her as much of a threat as she was and just tried to go past her. He tried in the sense that as he reached Moanna she held out her hand and he stopped in his tracks to see what she was doing. \"Leave them alone.\" She said angrily and Gregory laughed. \"I just stabbed you. I really don't think that you're in a position to be making demands from me.\" He made to walk around her. Moanna however had, had just about enough of Gregory and her eyes seemed to flash. ' \"I said leave them.\" Moanna said in a slow and fierce tone. Gregory didn't say anything but continued over to the crib with his dagger. \"Look how cute they are.\" He smirked mockingly over at the outraged Moanna as he stepped in front of the children. Something seemed to crack inside Moanna and she saw red. Gregory suddenly went flying into the wall by the door as though thrown by a giant hand. He looked over to see Moanna surrounded by a blue haze and hovering slightly above the ground. Her eyes were glowing and before he could think of anything else he was hit with some sort of light. Moanna however was drained by this energy use that so she fell into a dark unconsciousness. Crumpling on to the bloody ground next to Stephan as her brother and sister suddenly started to cry. oOoOo Moanna blinked and then suddenly shot upwards gasping and looking around frantically. The last thing that she remembered was the crying of her brother and sister and she couldn't hear them at all now. \"Calm down Moanna.\" Moanna looked over to see Dr. Blightly sitting next to her in a chair. \"Where are Tristan and Mari?\" Moanna said, realizing that she was not in the nursery anymore. \"They're fine.\" Dr. Blightly replied trying to sooth Moanna's nerves. \"Thanks to you it seems. I hear that Gregory has a few broken bones from being slammed against that wall.\" Moanna's expression turned dark. \"He tried to kill my brother and sister.\" Dr. Blightly's face suddenly became serious. \"Yes, we know. Gregory has been taken back to his own kingdom where I hear that his father has plans for a severe punishment. Needless to say he is no longer in line for the throne. Stephan isn't either you should be glad to know.\" \"Is he dead?\" Moanna asked warily not really sure she wanted to know the answer. Dr.Blightly however just shook his head. \"No. He will however be indebted to you for saving your life.\" \"Well at least he managed it one time.\" Moanna replied bitterly, thinking of all the times that he endangered her life to try to save it. \"I'm sure that he loves that fact that a woman saved his life.\" Dr. Blightly chuckled. \"Yes well, I suppose that he will just have to get used to the idea of a woman in power because now that he and his brother are not in line for the throne anymore it will go to his eldest sister.\" Moanna stared at the doctor then couldn't stop from laughing. Suddenly however she stopped and looked at him closely. \"You are telling me the truth aren't you? Mari and Tristan are all right?\" Dr. Blightly nodded again still calm. He had been expecting her to be doubtful. \"They are perfectly fine Moanna.\" \"Where are they then?\" Moanna glanced around her room nervously. \"They are in the King and Queen's room for the time being.\" Dr. Blightly replied. \"And the only reason that your parent's are not already in her at this moment is because we had no idea when you would be waking up.\" There seemed to be an unspoken end to that sentence that said that they didn't know if she had been going to wake up at all. Moanna heard this and asked tentatively. \"How long was I…..unconscious for?\" \"Only about two weeks.\" Dr. Blightly said in what was supposed to be a reassuring voice but this just made Moanna sit up straighter. He tried to get her to sit still. \"Moanna you need rest.\" \"I've been resting for two weeks!\" She exclaimed in frustration. \"I want to know what's going on. Is every one all right.\" Her eyes went wide. \"The forest!\" In all her worry about her brother and sister she had forgotten about the fire. \"Is the forest all right? Did many creatures die? Where is the Faun? Is Seda all right?\" Dr. Blightly grasped her shoulders to get her attention. \"Moanna, calm down.\" He waited a few moments as she began to breath normally again. When she was, he settled back into his chair, a slightly grimier expression on his face. Moanna noticed this with dread. \"The forest is….\" Dr. Blightly began and then stopped to consider his words. \"I wouldn't say fine but it did not suffer much damage.\" Noting the confused expression on Moanna's face he continued. \"The rain that Seda summoned managed to get the blaze down and the Faun managed to get a great deal of the creatures out of the forest.\" Moanna watched him closely. \"Are they all right?\" She asked, dread of the unknown present in her voice. \"The Faun is fine.\" Dr. Blightly said reassuring her. \"The only reason he isn't here right now is...\" He trailed off. \"Seda is still unconscious in the forest.\" \"What!\" Moanna exclaimed and again tried to get up. \"What's wrong with her?\" \"I can not say.\" Dr. Blightly said warily. \"The Faun believes that it is a more severe case of what he calls 'magical drain' then what happened with you, but even he doesn't know when she'll wake up.\" Hearing this Moanna swung her legs around the side of the bed and got shakily to her feet. She did all of this before Dr. Blightly could stop her. \"Moanna you need to stay in bed.\" \"I need to see if Seda's all right.\" Moanna said and with that Moanna disappeared in a cloud of smoke. Dr. Blightly looked at the place where she had just vanished from hoping she was strong enough to do what ever she had been trying to do. oOoOo Moanna appeared in a small clearing of the forest. She didn't realize how she had got there until she remembered what had happened. As she looked around she saw the Faun was looking at her oddly. \"Moanna?\" He asked as though he couldn't believe he was seeing her. Moanna smiled shakily, still a little tired from using even a little magic. She walked over to the Faun and he put his arm around her shoulder as she leaned against him, tired. \"You should be resting. I was not even aware you had woken up.\" He told her lightly and Moanna smiled. \"I just did, I just got here by accident.\" She looked up at the Faun. \"I needed to see Seda. Is she going to be all right?\" The Faun spread his arm out, bringing Moanna's attention to a figure on a bed of leaves. \"She is in a sleep but when she is fully rested she shall awake.\" Moanna looked closely at Seda and sighed when she saw that she was indeed breathing. She leaned back against the Faun and the two of them waited for Seda to wake up. Moanna wondering how long it was going to take for her mother to hear she was out of bed and the Faun was just glad that Moanna seemed fine. -- The end……okay not really there's another epilogue thingy that should tie up all the loose ends. (I am calling it an epilogue because I'm not planning to stick to my normal chapter length) I hope you had as much fun reading this as I did writing it and I hope you'll all like the last chapter….thingy.[Chapter 20] Disclaimer- I own no rights to Pan's Labyrinth A/N-Here it is everyone, I hope you enjoy it immensely! If there is anything odd about this chapter it may be because my computer died and I'm using a school one. Epilogue- After a few hours of waiting, the Faun had managed to convince Moanna that she should go back up to the castle before her mother sent a search party after her. Though she sighed in annoyance Moanna regretfully did see the truth in this. Besides as the Faun reminded her, she could go and see her brother and sister because he was sure that she was still slightly paranoid that they were not alright. So Moanna went back to the castle. It took a lot longer then usual as she had been almost drained from using her powers again. When she reached the castle she did see that her mother was just about to send out a search party for her. However, when the Queen caught sight of her daughter she quite calmed down. Moanna did as well once she had seen from her own two eyes that Tristan and Mari didn't even have a scratch on them. Only after that did Moanna allow herself to breathe normally again. oOoOo \"How is she?\" Dr.Blightly asked looking over from where he was sitting at his desk, Moanna had just returned from the forest and he was hoping to hear news of Seda. \"She's still out.\" Moanna said, with a shake of her head. It had been four months since Seda had gone into a coma and she was still in it. \"I think the Fauns starting to get worried.\" She said after a moment and Dr.Blightly frowned and shook his head. However at that moment he seemed to remember something because he dug around his desk and his pile of papers \"You received a letter today Moanna. The queen dropped it off with me because she assumed you would be coming here sometime today. Moanna nodded and took the letter, looking at it curiously. When she opened it and began to read she almost dropped it in surprise. The shock must have shown on her face because Dr.Blightly asked quickly if she was alright. \"I'm fine.\" Moanna said with a shake of her head. \"I'm just surprised, that's all. The letters from Bella.\" \"Why would she be writing you?\" Dr.Blightly asked, more to himself as Moanna began to read the letter. Dear Moanna I daresay that you did not expect to hear from me again. Well I just have to say, that despite the fact that I still hate you (and I do). I feel I must offer my congratulations and this one (to my great surprise) I am not being forced to write. I suppose you have heard by now that Gregory is actually getting imprisoned for what he did to you. In that aspect I feel I must tip my hat to you (of course I mean that figuratively because I never wear hats when I can help it.) Though I would have of course liked him to die (And I assume you do as well) I must say that it really will be entertaining to see how long he lasts in imprisonment. My wager is not much longer then a fortnight. As it is I am relived that nothing too bad has happened to Stephan (though if you breathe one word of that to anyone, you will be sorry)Though I am sure that his father thought that giving him labor work a lot worse then gaol. I'll be keeping in touch, Bella By the time she was finished reading the letter Moanna was almost in tears from laughing so much. Dr.Blightly was giving her some odd looks and had to wait patiently until Moanna caught her breath. \"She is absolutely...insane.\" Moanna said after a moment and then passed the letter to Dr.Blightly. \"May I ask what is so amusing?\" Moanna turned around to see that the Faun had entered to the room. As she told him about the letter Dr.Blightly was starting to chuckle as well. - \"Well I must say.\" Dr.Blightly said after the room had again gone quiet. \"She has a lot of courage sending this letter to you. It's even odder then her last one.\" Moanna nodded but looked rather embarrassed. \"Well I suppose that in a way it's my fault. I did write back to her.\" \"She should be imprisoned with Gregory.\" The Faun said calmly as he still bore a grudge against Bella for trying to kill Moanna. \"Yes well sadly we have no proof.\" Dr.Blightly replied gravely but then smiled. \"However I have heard through the castle gossip...\" \"You were talking to Tania then?\" Moanna said breaking in. \"Who else?\" Dr.Blightly chuckled. \"Anyway I have heard that Bella's stream of suitors is starting to run suspiciously dry. It seems that while she hasn't been linked directly with the whole affair most people believe that she did have a hand in it.\" Moanna shook her head. \"She may end up never ruling a kingdom. That's probably much worse then imprisonment for her.\" The Faun nodded after a moment. \"Yes, you may be right.\" \"I always am.\" Moanna said with a smirk while the Faun looked slightly amused. \"Well then.\" Moanna continued looking back at the letter in her hand. \"I'm sure that if she sends anymore letters they're going to be pretty interesting.\" \"If by interesting you mean full of insults then I am quite sure you are correct.\" At this Moanna whirled around to see Seda standing beside the Faun with a smirk on her face. - Though Moanna and Dr.Blightly looked quite astonished, the Faun managed to keep a neutral look on his face. He did however look over at her, his head tilted questionably. \"Yes?\" She said in an innocent voice. \"You were still unconscious when I saw you and that was only a little while ago.\" Moanna said incredulously. \"I just woke up.\" Seda replied with a shrug. \"If that is so.\" The Fain said gravely. \"Then you really should not be up.\" Seda however dismissed him with a wave of her hand. \"Nonsense, I only collapsed twice on the way here.\" After she said this, she stumbled a bit but managed to catch herself. Moanna rolled her eyes and walked over to Seda. \"You need to get some rest Seda, you're going to put yourself back into a coma.\" She took Seda's arm. \"You can use my bed if you want.\" Seda tried to protest but at an indication from the Faun Dr.Blightly came out from behind his desk and had Seda firmly by her other arm. Despite Seda's protests that she really didn't need any rest they managed to maneuver her into Moanna's room. - \"So are we going to have to tie her to the bed?\" Moanna asked with a chuckle The Faun found this amusing but merely shook his head. \"I am fairly certain that if we did do this we would pay for it when she regained her strength. Moanna nodded after a moment. \"That's probably true.\" oOoOo \"Well\" Dr.Blightly said as they walked out of the room where Seda had quickly fallen asleep (despite her earlier protests). \"She's there for now, but I doubt she will be there for long.\" The Faun nodded in agreement. \"Yes, I suspect that as soon as she is able to, she will disappear. She really is very proud and hates for people to see her as weak. Moanna nodded as well but before she could speak, the castle messenger arrived in front of her. \"The King and Queen wish to you all...No it is not because she has had a baby.\" He said this just as Moanna opened her mouth. It had become something of a running joke for Moanna to ask if her mother had, had a baby every time he delivered a message. Sighing because her fun was interrupted Moanna shook her head. \"Very well. The messenger led them all up to the King and Queens sitting room. Inside the room the King and Queen were sitting in chairs and holding Mari and Tristan. When they noticed that everyone was in the room, they thanked the messenger and turned their attention to them. \"We were rather hoping that Seda would be able to hear this.\" The Queen said with a small smile. \"However we feel that it is best to ask you this as soon as possible.\" \"Moanna.\" The King said after a moment, drawing Moanna's curious gaze away from her mother. \"Though you are no longer in line for the throne we hope that you will always feel welcome here.\" \"You and the Faun.\" The Queen put in, with an affectionate smile on her face. \"What we won't to ask you concerns both your and the twins future.\" At this Moanna had a slight inkling of what they were talking about. \"Once they grow older the twins will need tutors and we would like to know if you two would agree to be them.\" Moanna but her lip, she had been right. She looked over at the Faun who was also looking at her. \"What do you think?\" She asked him, with a small smile. The Faun tilted his head observing Moanna. \"If you would like to, then it would be fine with me.\" Moanna nodded. \"I would like to.\" She told her parents, who smiled broadly at this. Dr.Blightly smiled as well and soon he was talking to the King and Queen. oOoOo Once everyone was talking, Moanna turned to look at the Faun. \"You don't mind do you?\" The Faun looked down at her curiously. \"Mind what?\" \"Staying, and teaching me brother and sister. You will be happy won't you?\" She was worried that he might not really want to. However her fears left as he smiled down at her. \"I would be happy anywhere.\" The Faun replied seriously. \"As long as you were there with me.\" Moanna felt her cheeks flushing when he said this and she leaned up and kissed him briefly. \"I love you.\" She said with a smile. \"Would you come with me to tell Tanya the news?\" \"Of course.\" The Faun nodded. \"Though knowing her, she knows already.\" Moanna chuckled as they walked into the hallway. \"Oh most likely, but if she doesn't hear it from us she'll be offended.\" \"Of course she will.\" The Faun replied. After a moment Moanna was walking with the Faun down the hallway to the kitchen and towards the future. Now that is the end. Leave a review of what you thought. I can't even begin to describe how much enjoyment I have gotten from this story and all the review's I have gotten. Thank you all so much, especially to all those who reviewed more then one chapter. You guys RULE!! If you're wondering, I have slight plans for a sequel but it's going to wait till I write some other stuff first. Though if you like Labyrinth, I am planning on writing a crossover between that and Pan's Labyrinth Again, thanks for all the reviews!! -The Mad Maiden-","LastChapter":"Disclaimer- I own no rights to Pan's Labyrinth A/N-Here it is everyone, I hope you enjoy it immensely!

Dr.Blightly was giving her some odd looks and had to wait patiently until Moanna caught her breath. \"She is absolutely...insane.\" Moanna said after a moment and then passed the letter to Dr.Blightly. \"May I ask what is so amusing?\" Moanna turned around to see that the Faun had entered to the room. As she told him about the letter Dr.Blightly was starting to chuckle as well. - \"Well I must say.\" Dr.Blightly said after the room had again gone quiet. \"She has a lot of courage sending this letter to you. It's even odder then her last one.\" Moanna nodded but looked rather embarrassed. \"Well I suppose that in a way it's my fault. I did write back to her.\" \"She should be imprisoned with Gregory.\" The Faun said calmly as he still bore a grudge against Bella for trying to kill Moanna. \"Yes well sadly we have no proof.\" Dr.Blightly replied gravely but then smiled. \"However I have heard through the castle gossip...\" \"You were talking to Tania then?\" Moanna said breaking in. \"Who else?\" Dr.Blightly chuckled. \"Anyway I have heard that Bella's stream of suitors is starting to run suspiciously dry. It seems that while she hasn't been linked directly with the whole affair most people believe that she did have a hand in it.\" Moanna shook her head. \"She may end up never ruling a kingdom. That's probably much worse then imprisonment for her.\" The Faun nodded after a moment. \"Yes, you may be right.\" \"I always am.\" Moanna said with a smirk while the Faun looked slightly amused. \"Well then.\" Moanna continued looking back at the letter in her hand. \"I'm sure that if she sends anymore letters they're going to be pretty interesting.\" \"If by interesting you mean full of insults then I am quite sure you are correct.\" At this Moanna whirled around to see Seda standing beside the Faun with a smirk on her face. - Though Moanna and Dr.Blightly looked quite astonished, the Faun managed to keep a neutral look on his face. He did however look over at her, his head tilted questionably. \"Yes?\" She said in an innocent voice. \"You were still unconscious when I saw you and that was only a little while ago.\" Moanna said incredulously. \"I just woke up.\" Seda replied with a shrug. \"If that is so.\" The Fain said gravely. \"Then you really should not be up.\" Seda however dismissed him with a wave of her hand. \"Nonsense, I only collapsed twice on the way here.\" After she said this, she stumbled a bit but managed to catch herself. Moanna rolled her eyes and walked over to Seda. \"You need to get some rest Seda, you're going to put yourself back into a coma.\" She took Seda's arm. \"You can use my bed if you want.\" Seda tried to protest but at an indication from the Faun Dr.Blightly came out from behind his desk and had Seda firmly by her other arm. Despite Seda's protests that she really didn't need any rest they managed to maneuver her into Moanna's room. - \"So are we going to have to tie her to the bed?\" Moanna asked with a chuckle The Faun found this amusing but merely shook his head. \"I am fairly certain that if we did do this we would pay for it when she regained her strength. Moanna nodded after a moment. \"That's probably true.\" oOoOo \"Well\" Dr.Blightly said as they walked out of the room where Seda had quickly fallen asleep (despite her earlier protests). \"She's there for now, but I doubt she will be there for long.\" The Faun nodded in agreement. \"Yes, I suspect that as soon as she is able to, she will disappear. She really is very proud and hates for people to see her as weak. Moanna nodded as well but before she could speak, the castle messenger arrived in front of her. \"The King and Queen wish to you all...No it is not because she has had a baby.\" He said this just as Moanna opened her mouth. It had become something of a running joke for Moanna to ask if her mother had, had a baby every time he delivered a message. Sighing because her fun was interrupted Moanna shook her head. \"Very well. The messenger led them all up to the King and Queens sitting room. Inside the room the King and Queen were sitting in chairs and holding Mari and Tristan. When they noticed that everyone was in the room, they thanked the messenger and turned their attention to them. \"We were rather hoping that Seda would be able to hear this.\" The Queen said with a small smile. \"However we feel that it is best to ask you this as soon as possible.\" \"Moanna.\" The King said after a moment, drawing Moanna's curious gaze away from her mother. \"Though you are no longer in line for the throne we hope that you will always feel welcome here.\" \"You and the Faun.\" The Queen put in, with an affectionate smile on her face. \"What we won't to ask you concerns both your and the twins future.\" At this Moanna had a slight inkling of what they were talking about. \"Once they grow older the twins will need tutors and we would like to know if you two would agree to be them.\" Moanna but her lip, she had been right. She looked over at the Faun who was also looking at her. \"What do you think?\" She asked him, with a small smile. The Faun tilted his head observing Moanna. \"If you would like to, then it would be fine with me.\" Moanna nodded. \"I would like to.\" She told her parents, who smiled broadly at this. Dr.Blightly smiled as well and soon he was talking to the King and Queen. oOoOo Once everyone was talking, Moanna turned to look at the Faun. \"You don't mind do you?\" The Faun looked down at her curiously. \"Mind what?\" \"Staying, and teaching me brother and sister. You will be happy won't you?\" She was worried that he might not really want to. However her fears left as he smiled down at her. \"I would be happy anywhere.\" The Faun replied seriously. \"As long as you were there with me.\" Moanna felt her cheeks flushing when he said this and she leaned up and kissed him briefly. \"I love you.\" She said with a smile. \"Would you come with me to tell Tanya the news?\" \"Of course.\" The Faun nodded. \"Though knowing her, she knows already.\" Moanna chuckled as they walked into the hallway. \"Oh most likely, but if she doesn't hear it from us she'll be offended.\" \"Of course she will.\" The Faun replied. After a moment Moanna was walking with the Faun down the hallway to the kitchen and towards the future. Now that is the end. Leave a review of what you thought.

He didn't have a say. He was a boxer way past his prime. Our mom had me late when Apollo was in his 20s. She had a womb of steel to not have me by caesarean. But that's a different story. I moaned against his lips as he forced me up against the wall of the hotel. He was strong and knew how to keep me pinned. His lips were warm and smooth as his tongue moved down into my throat. I moaned against him more and in seconds he tore away my tank top and removed my bra before I could even blink. He stopped for a split second and placed my hands against his shirt while his lips devoured mine again. I pulled his shirt over his head and he helped me get it off. He was so tall and his stomach was flat and rock hard. This only turned me on more. Once his shirt was off, I worked at his pants. I had flown in from Colorado to watch my big brother fight- some exhibition match with a Russian soldier. The problem was Apollo Creed had come out of a five year retirement. What the hell is he thinking? \" Seriously, what the hell are you thinking?\" I asked him in his large room of his large mansion. He waved me off. \" This guy's a push over. Some Russian guy who I can easily beat.\" he said. I winced. \" Apollo… I may not have seen this guy, but I am pretty sure anyone can be you now. You're not the young man you use to be.\" I said gently and he just waved me off. \" Look, I didn't pay for you to come all the way here just so you can lecture me on mortality.\" he snapped. I tensed some and nodded. \" You're right. If this is what you want. I support you.\" I replied. He gave me a look over. \" Good. Will you be staying here tonight?\" he asked. I shrugged. My things were still in the car I had rented. \" I can.\" I replied and he nodded. \" Good. I want you at the press conference with me and Rocky tonight. Show em' what a real American family looks like.\" he said. I looked down in thought before hearing the door open. I looked to see Mary Ann coming in and I smiled and her eyes brightened on me. \" Alicia! I didn't know you were here!\" she said in happiness moving with great speed to me. \" Hey!\" I said happily and moved over and embraced her. We had gotten along great even when she and Apollo started dating. She was like my big sister, and I knew I could tell her anything. \" When did you get in?\" she asked. I melted into her hug before moving back. \" Just a few minutes ago. I wanted to hear with my own ears why my brother is thinking he's David, taking on a giant. I heard he was huge.\" I replied and she gave me a look. \" Girl, yes. You haven't seen him?\" she asked. I shook my head. \" No.\" I responded and she shook her head slowly. \" I worry for my husband, but he doesn't seem to notice.\" She said looking at Apollo who was looking at suits in his closet. \" My favorite girls are worrying about nothing.\" he said glancing at us through the large body mirror in the corner of the room. I merely shook my head and Mary Ann looked at me. \" How is Colorado?\" she asked. I smiled. \" Good very good.\" I replied. \" And you're photography?\" she asked. I smiled even more. \" It's really good actually. I have some weddings to go to in the next month.\" I replied. \" Oh that's wonderful. Glad that is working out for you.\" she said. I nodded. \" Thanks. Well I am going to unpack then hit the gym.\" I said heading to the door. Apollo pointed at me. \" Hey! Make sure you're back in this house by 8 the press is at 10 tonight.\" he said. I waved my hand. \" I got it, I got it.\" I responded. As I was moving down the hall, I had bumped into Rocky outside. He saw me and smiled. \" Hey Alicia.\" he called and I smiled at him. \" Rocky hi.\" I said hugging him. He had a nice manly smell about him. It was easy for me to smell people when they were near, and I liked the scent of a man. I pulled back and he looked at my car. \" You just getting in?\" he asked and I nodded. \" Yes. I was unpacking my things then hitting the gym.\" I responded. He nodded. \" Well I don't want to hold you up. It's good to see you. Here I'll help you unload.\" he said. I smiled and nodded. \" Thanks, Rock.\" I replied. With Rock's help I was able to make it to the gym a bit early. There was a lot of press there. I thought for a moment they would be here for me, but I could tell it was for something else. I decided not to get curious. I walked inside hearing nothing but chatter and camera flashing sounds. Someone famous must have been here. This gym was for high classed people. Not just anyone could afford a membership. I was wearing a black sports bra under a black tank and tight white shorts. The noise of whoever was here still bothered me, so I went to the second floor which had the track. If you leaned over you could see the bottom of the gym. The noise was not an improvement so I decided to do my stretches and just start my run. I started out with forty minutes of jogging before some guy in a yellow jump suit came over to me by the doors. \" Get off the track we have star coming.\" he said in a thick Russian accent. I looked him over. \" Excuse me. You don't know me. You do not command me.\" I stated. He looked me over and then stiffened. \" Ma'am. Please get off the track.\" he said forcing a kinder tone. I grabbed my gym back shooting him a glare on my way back. I could hear the crowd coming up the stairs of the building so I took a side door down to the first floor. The remainder of my gym was lifting weights, seeing old friends, and then hitting a bar Apollo use to go to in town. The sun would be coming down soon, and I still had time to just live a little. I was sitting at the bar by myself now since most of my old friends had husbands and lives to go back to. I made sure to call Apollo to tell him where I was and that I would be back home soon. I use to wish I had a life to go back to. Back in Colorado I just worked. I had no husband or someone to rely on me. Someone sat down beside me, their large form towered over me it seemed. I glanced at him to see he was a tall white guy with sharp blonde hair and wore all black as if he didn't want to really be noticed. \" Another shot Miss Creed?\" Louis the bartender asked. I smiled politely. \" No thank you. You've taken care of me enough.\" I replied. I noticed the large man look over at me and I couldn't tell if I had seen correctly, but he looked almost disgusted. I looked up at him. \" Can I help you?\" I asked. He now looked away quite quickly as if not wanting to be looked in the face. He was cute. \" No…sorry.\" he muttered. Was that an accent I hear? I arched a brow and he slowly glanced back at me. I just looked away and just looked forward. \" What's a guy like you doing in a place like this?\" I asked. The bar was a bit loud, but conversation side by side could still be exchanged. He looked down at me wondering if I was talking to him. I looked dead at him and he just blinked as if mildly taken back. He just looked away and I shrugged. \"Suit yourself.\" I finished my shot and rummaged through my suit looking for cash. \" Why is Creed's wife at bar?\" he asked. I glanced up at him now definitely catching an accent since he spoke louder. I chuckled. \" Just because my last name is Creed doesn't mean I am Apollo Creed's wife.\" I replied and he hunched over a bit as if mildly embarrassed. \" Sorry. I should not assume.\" he said. Now I turned my body to him. \" It's okay. Why are you here?\" I asked. He looked at me a bit stunned. \" I am just trying…to get away from it all.\" he responded. His English seemed worked at. I haven't met too many foreigners in Colorado. \" Are you Russian?\" I asked and he nodded looking around some before looking down at me. \" Yes. Uh… From Soviet Union.\" he replied. I nodded and smiled. \" Cool.\" I responded raising my hand. \"I'm Alicia.\" He looked at my hand and seemed somewhat taken back by it. Slowly he took it and he nodded. \" Ivan Drago.\" he responded. I smiled. \" Nice to meet you Mr. Drago.\" I replied. \"So what is a man like you need to get away from? Wife and family I presume.\" He gave a small shrug. \" My wife and I have… grown apart. She is seeing someone else I am sure.\" he replied. I nodded. \" I'm so sorry. I would usually walk around town when I needed to think. You should too if you ever get the chance.\" I replied. He blinked some and gave a light nod. \" You have boyfriend?\" he asked. I shook my head. \" No I am up here from Colorado visiting family.\" I replied. He nodded once more. His tone was dry and he seemed obviously distant. I merely nodded and sat my shot glass down not really noticing I was playing with it. \"Well Mr. Drago, it was nice talking to you if only for a little while. I hope you accomplish whatever it is you were looking for here in America.\" I began to move from my spot and he suddenly stood up towering over me. He had to have been 6'5. \" Ms. Licia… would you like to get out of here?\" he asked almost boldly and I looked him over for a moment before nodding and giving a soft smile. \" Sure.\" I replied. I let out a loud moan as I felt his cock spread me open. I didn't think he was this big, but he was and he pushed every inch into me, as he held up my right. He light blue eyes seemed endless as he looked into my own. I panted hard and fast as his movements were sharp and quick. He didn't seem to hold back. He kept me pinned to the bed as he rode out whatever it was he was feeling against me. My head fell back and I was engulfed in pleasure I had never felt with another man. His lips pressed into my neck and he sucked hard on my jugular. His other hand came up and groped my breast hard and I hissed hard as he pinched my nipple and pulled it. I let out a whimper and my hips were rocking back and forth against him. \"Fuck.\" I whispered feeling him hit that spot inside me causing more and more pleasure to build up inside me. The bed creaked and moved beneath us, and it was only seconds before he flipped us over, his back now on the bed and his hands bruising my hips. I was already grinding my hips against and the friction was delicious and beautiful. He grunted and moaned lowly and my sounds mixed right in to it. His hands left my hips only to grope my breasts and he growled lowly as I began to bounce my hips. Out of all the lust, my eyes drifted over to dresser and I could see the clock. It was 7:30 already. My mind was starting to come down slowly from my pleasure realizing I would have to go soon, but in seconds, Ivan sat up and gripped my neck pulling me in to him, our lips crashing against one another as he guided my hip with his other hand. He was so dominant and feral. It was all becoming too much, my moans heightening a sign I was getting close. \"Oh my god.\" I cried out and shut my eyes tight feeling my orgasm hit me hard and Ivan growled holding me down so that I could feel his cock throbbing inside me as he came. I wrapped my arms around his neck as if to hold on to something while I came down from my orgasmic high. I panted slowly moving off him and he let me. After a few seconds, he moved off the bed and began to find his clothes. I was familiar with one night stands, I knew the drill. I got off the bed and began to dress myself. I didn't even know what to say to him, so when I was decent, I left and headed back to Apollo's.[Chapter 2] 2 Normal pov Ivan's mind was swimming it seemed and usually- no always he kept a clear head. He had just had a one night stand with a woman he just met, a black woman no less. There were many racial boundaries in Russia pertaining to colored people, but Ivan was too busy training to be the best, he had no time to ever be prejudice and coming to America, he knew it would not be accepted even if racial tension was accepted many years prior. He had seen numerous women of different races, and had to admit that black women were very exotic and different. But she WAS different. She was fascinating and wild. Her brown eyes were beautiful and held a story to them. Her skin was so smooth that he couldn't keep his hands off her, and was worried he'd bruise her. But he couldn't help it. She was not like his wife who was a stranger to new sexual positions and had to force many moans and sounds. But Alicia Creed, the sounds she made were real and it fueled Ivan to ride her until he couldn't physically move. Even when her attention start to leave, it was easy to bring her mind right back to him. After the fight with the pathetic Apollo Creed he would find her and somehow, maybe, ask her to come to Russia. Now Ivan felt foolish as he buttoned his uniform up. He didn't even know a thing about the woman except that she was a successful photographer in Colorado, but she was single. Ivan inhaled and remained quiet even as Ludmilla came up and buttoned up his collar. She gave a professional smile. \"Handsome.\" she replied. Ivan just gave a disinterested nod. He was very well aware of his wife's adultery, which is why he felt no guilt in sleeping with Alicia the African Goddess. He had never slept with any other woman but his wife, but he knew that she knew he was aware. Ivan never said much, but with Alicia, he felt he could not stop talking. He had made up his mind. After his fight, he would go find Alicia and try and start a friendship if nothing else, maybe a relationship. Alicia's POV I had made it home to questions from my brother. \"Where were you, we need to go.\" he chastised and I was showering quickly to get Drago's smell off of me. Once I was out and lotioning and changing, he was still yelling. \"You had one job, Alicia!\" he yelled and Mary Ann moved to fix his tie as they stood outside my room. \"Oh Apollo leave her alone. She's here and we will make it.\" she said. \"Hey you guys ready to go?\" Rocky yelled from downstairs. \"Almost!\" Apollo and I shouted in unison. I was finally finished with my hair in natural long waves and in a nice dressy lavender skirt with a white blouse and matching lavender suit. I moved down stairs and met my family by the door. They all looked at me and smiled. \"Finally.\" Apollo said. \"Let's go.\" Rocky and my brother walked out first. Mary Ann smiled and wrapped her arm around mine. \"I look forward to hearing about this mystery man you have been with soon.\" she whispered. I guess she could smell more than just sweat and alcohol. I merely looked down with a flushed smile before nodding. Apollo was always giving me lectures about my promiscuous ways. He wanted me to settle down with my fortune and marry a man of equal status to him. Because of his pressure, Mary Anna was more understanding and seemed always interested in who I was with. Maybe she hoped I would find someone out of them. I've been to the same press conferences before with my brother, but it has been years since he was retired. The limo that drove us pulled up at the conference building and reporters were everywhere. We were escorted in and were told to wait a bit while the final preparations were given to the room. \"Mr. Koloff any comments on the Drago Apollo fight taking place in three days!\" I heard a reporter call out, but my attention was immediately caught. I did a double take and saw a second crowd coming in like the ocean around people. My heart nearly jumped as I saw who it was. Ivan Drago, the guy I had just slept with hours earlier was here? My eyes widened as I slowly looked over to my brother to see him scoffing at the second crowd as if not even afraid. No. This couldn't happen. I have felt his strength and power in the bed. There was no way my brother would ever win against him. The doors of the press room opened and we were all walking inside. By now, both crowds had collided and now everyone was looking at each other. Ivan saw me and seemed openly shocked to see me. I stared at him for a moment feeling as if we were the only two people here. It wouldn't be long until our stares were noticed, so I broke it first and followed my family inside. The men sat on the stage on long tables and Mary Ann and I sat with Adrienne at the front row. On the left side Ivan sat down right beside my brother and he was huge compared to him. I leaned over to Mary Ann. \"Apollo is fighting him? He's ginoromous.\" I said and she nodded. \"Have faith in your brother. He will be okay.\" she said, but I was not easily convinced. Beside Ivan was a petite woman in a nice grey business suit. She had a casual beauty about her almost business like. She must have been Ivan's wife. I looked away hiding my mild jealousy, but paid attention once it all began. A reporter was called on and he stood up. \"Apollo what made you decide to put on an exhibition fight with Drago?\" he asked. My brother laughed some. \"Oh let's call it a central responsibility.\" he said proudly. \"Responsibility how?\" he asked. \"Well I had to teach this young to box.\" he replied. I drowned out most of the questions and answers and looked up at Ivan who just stared straight forward looking higher and mightier than my brother, so mighty that his wife answered for him every time. He looked right past the crowd and looked directly at me. He just stared at me for a moment and I looked away. He needed to stop or else someone taking pictures will notice he is looking at me. I was such a fool. I didn't even bother to ask my brother a single thing about the man he was supposed to be fighting. Instead I just looked at my brother as he argued with Drago's manager Nicoli Koloff. Everyone was arguing now about who is more superior and Rocky just looked down not entertained by the argument. \"You get that big chump in the ring right now!\" my brother threatened and now he was standing up and this caused a chain reaction in everyone on the stage who stood up. Rocky grabbed Apollo trying to restrain him and already I thought a fight would break out. Ivan then shoved Apollo causing an uproar and now he was trying to fight his way to the Russian soldier, but was held back. Ivan was not the least bit intimidated and held his ground giving a blank yet fierce some stare. Even as his wife attempted to hold him back he was ready to fight. I couldn't believe this was happening. As soon as the messy conference was over, I was the first to yell when we got home. \"You cannot fight that man!\" I stated and he was loosening his tie now. \"You think Ima back down now after that performance not a chance. The fight's in three weeks I will not look weak. You're worrying too much anyways, I will use this chance to train nonstop.\" he said. I shook my head. \"You are going to get seriously hurt. The man's twenty four years old Apollo! That's my age. He is younger and faster and stronger.\" I said. They had shown a few clips of Ivan's punching strength. \"You could be seriously injured!\" \"Look I don't need you in my face telling me what I can and can't do!\" he shouted causing me to tense. \"I am not going to back down and if you're just going to stand here and throw a tantrum then go to your room!\" I couldn't believe he had just said that. Furious, tired and cranky I turned and just sped off to the room I was staying in. I slammed the door, took of my makeup and took one more shower before heading to bed. The next morning, I had gotten up early and got ready for the gym. I ate a small breakfast and waited forty minutes before driving to the gym. I collected my gym bag and headed inside. I needed to blow off steam from last night's argument. I did my stretches and hit the track. How could Apollo be so… blind to the fact that Ivan could destroy him? If something happened to him, my world would be crushed. I was twenty five minutes in and have already broken into a sweat. I liked this. Just as I was fifteen minutes away from being done, a flash of white ran right past me, and I jumped because I wasn't expecting it. I saw a lean body in a white leotard and it only took seconds of seeing blonde hair to know it was Ivan. My eyes widened and I just paused for a moment before realizing that his trainers could be around. I saw him running to the other side already looking at me, and I tensed noticing he was lightly jogging. I continued my jog now running and watching him. He picked up speed and my mind immediately felt he was running after me. So I hurried to the other side where the doors were and just grabbed my bag as quick as I could. \"Wait.\" I hear him say and I turn to see him already there sweating before me. \"What are you doing?\" I asked sharply leaving the track room and he followed. \"I decided to get a two hour work out in before managers come.\" he said and I immediately smacked him. He was hardly faced and it was like hitting a piece of metal and he just looked stunned that I had actually hit him. \"I mean what the hell are you doing agreeing to fight my brother?\" I said. His eyes widened even more. \"Brother? But he's so old and you are so young.\" he said. I just continued walking down the hall. It was empty this early in the morning, and I just didn't say anything. \"Licia, please speak.\" he said. I paused again and looked at him. \"Why? I just slept with the enemy.\" I said almost disgusted and continued to walk once more. \"This just… business. To show America that Russia is also superior.\" he said. I scoffed. \"No you want to show that Russia is superior almost more.\" I said now entering the girl's locker room and throwing my bag on the sink so it won't get wet in the shower. \"It cannot be helped…fight is happening.\" I heard him say right behind me. I stop walking in all movements and I turn and look up at him. \"Are you insane get out of here!\" I said pushing against his hard chest, but I did not move him. He arched a brow. \"Why?\" he asked softly taking a step back. \"This is the girl's bathroom.\" I replied and now he looked around at the entire room in a circular motion before looking at me. \"Athletes shower all the time in Russia.\" he said slowly and carefully walking over to me. Now I was mildly tensed and I looked him over watching as he stalked towards me. \"Well we are not in Russia.\" I said weakly now and he just shook his head. \"No…we not.\" he said in a low yet heated voice. \"Wh-what are you doing?\" I asked taking steps back watching as cut on the showers. It was a perfect square with four shower heads on each wall and he just cut them all on. My body was now growing soaked, my clothes growing heavy on me, weighing me down. I began to remove them on instinct and now he towered over me causing me to jump and press my back into the wall. He just looked down at me with that blank stare from yesterday, eyes staring at me with dominance. He lifted his strong arms and they moved past my hips and that's when I felt the shower heads above us cut on, the last two. I gasped some feeling water shower right down on me. My hair stuck to me immediately and Ivan just looked at me still. His hands moved to my jacket and he unzipped it and threw it to the side. I couldn't believe he was doing this. My heart was pounding like crazy and I inhaled gently as I watched him slide down my panties and pants together. I used my own feet to kick off my shoes and socks and kicked them in the corner of my jacket. Last was my bra, and he just moved his hands up my stomach without even grazing my skin. He just grasped the bottom of my bra and I raised my arms on instinct and felt it being lifted. My breasts bounced from their tight hold and I watched as Ivan threw it over toward my other pile of clothes. Now I was completely naked and wet, my hair just flowing over my breasts. The room was filled with mist and I watched Ivan just look me over with approval and my eyes slowly looked down to see a large bulge in his pants and I gasped gently at the sight that I had caused such a reaction. He then takes hold of my wrists and placed them to his chest running my palms over his smooth skin. I let my finger nails lightly scrape over the area his nipples were and his eyes close in pleasure as he raised his hands to the shoulder straps of his leotard. I continued to rub his skin watching as his pulls off the suit and now I am just left with him standing naked before me. He now opened his eyes and looked down at me. He was a giant compared to me and it almost scared me. His large hands gently moved to my chest and our eyes didn't leave one another as his hands groped my breasts. I let out a gentle mewl and he leans closer in to me before swooping down and capturing my lips possessively.[Chapter 3] 3 The water against my skin felt amazing as Ivan's hands roamed my body. His lips devoured mine and his tongue fought mine for dominance. He dominated men in the ring and even now he's going to dominate me. Maybe it was time for a different course of action. I leaned back some and bit down on his lower lip causing him to growl, and place his hands beneath my bottom and raise me into the air, my back sliding easily up the slippery wall. My arms wrapped around him tight so I wouldn't fall. He pressed me into the wall with his body and I felt him guiding my body down. With my legs already spread, I could feel the head of his cock press into me and I gasped into his mouth, my hands gripping his shoulders. \"Ah… this is wrong.\" I whispered into his mouth. \"But you feel so right…and wet…and tight.\" he said staring into my eyes with lust his soft voice pushing me over the edge as he lowers me further down on him. Before I know it, he gently slides me off the wall and lies me on my back and he thrusts in me hard holding me down onto the ground so the slippery water would not move us. My legs locked around him and I felt moans escape me causing echoes in the bathroom, but the running showers blocked out the noises. He grunted and growled in my ear as he moved inside me fast and rough. Even though the water was cool, my body was on fire and it felt amazing. The look on his face as he moved brought me great joy. He looked to be concentrating, eyes shut tight and mouth lightly opened letting out pants and moans. My fingers scraped down his back and he leaned back from me and placed me on my hands and knees. He entered me once more and I felt a jolt of pleasure shoot from my vagina all the way up my spine. \"Oh god!\" I cried out. His fingers were bruising my hips, and my walls were vibrating in pleasure and bliss. I felt his rock hard chest pressing into my back, and one hand reached around and groped my breast hard while the other moved between my legs rubbing my clit. The way he did everything was driving me insane. He pressed firmly into my sensitive pearl and rubbed it with just his finger tips and the sensation was beautiful. His fast thrusting mixed with his firm rubbing was becoming too much for me. My vagina was tingling and on the verge of bursting with pleasure. I was suddenly surprised, by the emptiness I felt inside me and I looked back to see his fingers replaced his cock, and they were quite large. I yelped at another jolt of pleasure, and I could see him smirking as he teased me. I even felt his thumb tease my ass, a new feeling I had never felt before. My body was convulsing and shaking from the teasing. \"Are you going to cum?\" he asked in a husky voice and I nodded swiftly. \"Yes.\" I cried out. \"You want my cock back inside you?\" he asked his sexy accent entering my head. I nodded desperately again. \"Yes I do.\" I replied and he continued to rub my sensitive lips, his middle finger slipping inside me violently. \"Then tell me this will not be the last time we meet, that no matter what happens after my fight with brother, you will come to me.\" he said. My brain felt like it was turning to mush, and I bit my lip hard trying to hold back everything. How could he expect me to tell him that? His fingers vibrated inside me hoever, snapping me out of my thoughts. \"Yes! I promise nothing will change.\" I cried out now feeling his fingers leave me and he gripped my shoulders pulling me upward and turning me around. He was sitting down and he pulled me on top of him kissing me roughly as he did so. He guided me down his body and I whimpered feeling his cock refill me. I wrapped my arms around his neck curling my fingers into his damp hair. I bounced my body atop of his feeling the delicious friction building up inside me again. He felt amazing and his strength to hold me down made me crave him more. My head fell back and I felt everything hitting me at once. I ground my hips against his suddenly yelling out in pleasure as my orgasm hit me hard. Ivan groped my breast with one hand and I felt his fingers dig into my flesh as his eyes shut and a lustful moan escaped him as I felt him cum deep inside me. I shivered with pleasure feeling overwhelmed with sensations and feelings. Why did he want me? Why did he have such power over me? Ivan began to lie back and he just wrapped his arms around me bringing me down with him and now I just lied on his chest, water sliding down our bodies and going into the drains. \"Why do you want to keep doing this?\" I whispered and he looked down at me tilting his head downward to look at me. \"Because, you're special.\" he replied lightly before leaning his head back. He said nothing more after that, and after a few minutes we both got up and dried off. I didn't even know what to say to him. I changed into a new outfit and now turned to him. He was just in his leotard again. I tried to move for the door, when his firm hand grabbed me. \"Wait,\" he said and I looked up at him. \"When can I see you again?\" he asked. I looked him over unsure. \"You will have to start training soon. And you do not need any distractions, so I don't know.\" I replied and he just looked around the room and I shook my head. \"I cannot keep meeting you here in the showers.\" He gave a look of disappointment. \"The hotel we first made love at.\" he said. I scoffed. \"We didn't make love we just fucked.\" I replied. He shrugged. \"What is difference?\" he asked. I gave a dry laugh. \"Making love is when there is passion and love or just strong feeling of like. Fucking is hard and rough and crazy with no emotion after word.\" I replied slipping from his hold and moving to the door. \"We will let time tell what happens next. Good luck in your training.\" And with that said I moved from the bathroom and hurried down the hall trying to avoid any unwanted stares. I returned to my brother's house only to see nothing but press in front of the house. For a moment, I thought they had found out what had taken place between Ivan and I, and were here to ask questions about a scandal or something. Maybe my brother knew? Now I was afraid. Once I had parked, I got out of the car and was only hit with questions of my brother and the Russian soldier he was fighting. I was relieved to know that was the case.[Chapter 4] 4 Apollo's match was in three days, Friday, and even the training he had been doing in the past few months had slowed him down. He was too old, even I knew that, but I knew he did not want to hear my worries, so I supported him whenever I could and watched him train on occasion. But even these few months were more of a hardship for me. Ivan had been using every attempt to talk to me, at the gym or press conferences between he and my brother. He never spoke, his wife spoke for him giving him an even more lethal appearance. Mary Ann and I would sit next to Adrian in the front of the room and he would look down at me from time to time- sometimes for more than five seconds and I could see the want in his eyes, the need to dominate and over power me and already I was always looking away embarrassed so no one would catch on. Luckily, I was not getting too much paparazzi following me. I was just his sister and they wanted to hear more from Mary Ann, Rocky, or Tony. I kept telling myself not to worry for it was a simple exhibition match. Apollo would learn from this fight and Ivan could go on fighting a champion in order to prove that he and his country were superior just like America. The sun was just setting and I was doing some shopping down town to take my mind away from this fight that was to come. I had my shopping bags in my hand and was moving through the parking garage to find my car, but I was not alone. My eyes deepened now as I could see the tall figure that was standing near my car. I was beneath a light post imbedded in the ceiling so when I was close I could see who it was. \"Ivan?\" I asked. Ivan looked my way and immediately his blank and silent eyes came to life. \"Licia.\" he said with relief as he moved over to me. I paused in my walk and raised my hand stopping him. He was in a grey hoody and sweat pants. \"What are you doing here, how did you know I would be here?\" I questioned and he shrugged and gave a light scoff. \"I was… jogging and recognized your car.\" he said. I arched a brow. I know he had seen my car on the first night I met him. \"Why would you be doing any training without your team and wife?\" I asked and he tensed some, keeping his hands tucked in his pockets. \"It's good to get away and train alone.\" he said. I placed my hands on my hips, my bags scrunching together. \"You are a Russian boxer and infantry captain in the USSR. Your absence would be easily noticed by your team of trainers. You are the hallmark of Russia your team wants to show you off constantly, so you being here means something.\" I explained. He looked at me with an amused smirk, but it was smile. \"You know more about me than I you… I wanted to see you again. I am wearing this so no one will recognize me.\" he answered motioning his dead down at his body. I nodded moving carefully over to my car and unlocking the back door and placing my bags inside. I then closed it and turned to him noticing how close he was towering over me. His male body scent washed over me causing me to shiver and I shook my head avoiding his light green and blue gaze. \"Ivan, I don't know what you want me to say. You are a Russian boxer and very well known. I'm just the sister of a man you plan to fight,\" I started and watching as his hands began to move on either side of me and resting flat against my car windows. \"And you are married.\" He shrugged and shook his head. \"It is all for public… she is with another man right now.\" he said and I shook my head. \"It doesn't matter she is your wife and I won't be a mistress.\" I said and before I could even inhale, his lips were over mine smooth and honey tasting and I felt my entire body betray my words. My hands gripped his face and wrapped around his neck and his hands embraced my form pulling me closer. His tongue entered my mouth and I moaned out feeling the heat arise in my body again. \"I want you to come with me to Russia.\" he muttered against my lips and now my body froze and my movements against him stopped. I pulled back a bit and looked up at him. \"What?\" I asked feeling as though I didn't comprehend his words. He nodded. \"After my fights here and my victories, I will be going back to the USSR. I want you to come back with me.\" he said and I blinked feeling a weight already bearing down on my chest. I leaned back more and his arms didn't leave my body. \"Ivan… you don't know what you're saying.\" I said and he shook his head firmly. \"I may not always speak, but when I do I always mean what I say.\" he said and I just stared at him for a moment. I shook my head and moved back from him now. \"This is just lust talking.\" I said and Ivan shook his head again. \"No. This want- need.\" he said and I looked up at him. \"You don't know anything about me. Look this is all just fun between us. After your fight with my brother, you will continue to seek fame and be a Russian champion, and I will go back to Colorado and continue working.\" I said moving to open my, but Ivan's large hand closed it shut and I looked up at him swiftly to see a hard look on his face. \"Your brother will lose. He should not fight me.\" he said and I nodded gripping the door handle harder. \"At least we both agree on that.\" I said looking at his hand waiting for him to move his hand, but he didn't. He looked indecisive about something before looking away. \"Do you want me?\" he asked and I felt the air in my throat get caught and I swallowed some looking down unsure if I should lie or not. I felt curled fingers beneath my chin and now I was looking up at the giant of a man and I nodded. \"I do.\" I answered breathlessly and he nodded leaning over me again before dipping his head down and kissing me again. I responded and felt the spark ignite inside me again and he pulled me into him again deepening the kiss and devouring my mouth. I stopped myself however and pushed back from him. \"Don't.\" He panted some and looked me over shaking his head now. \"I have never met any woman with fire in their eyes that burns as bright as the fire in yours.\" he said. \"I don't care about what happens in my matches, I just want you. Your body and…. Your personality. You make me want to take you against this car right now. I have never had thoughts of doing something so shameful but I want to.\" I stared at him for a long moment unsure of what to do or say, but I could see in his eyes that he wasn't lying. I looked around for a moment noticing how dark it was before looking up at him. \"Come with me I know a place we can go.\" I said moving to open my car door. He followed my actions and got inside the passenger's side. He placed his hood over his and glanced at me as I backed out of the parking lot and drove on. \"Where do we go?\" he asked. \"There's a secluded house, my brother bought for me to stay at whenever I came to town. I like the quiet so I can go there and take pictures.\" I said. \"You like this work? Photography?\" he asked butchering the word, but I nodded. \"It's my passion. Is fighting your passion?\" I asked and he nodded. \"Fighting and serving my country.\" he responded proudly.[Chapter 5] 5 We drove in silence not really knowing what to say to each other. I preferred it this way, because maybe he would tell me to stop the car and tell me that I was right and that we couldn't do this. We were just compromising each other. \"How long you like to take pictures?\" he asked cutting through the silence. I glanced at him to see he was looking at me with those deep curious eyes. \"Since I was a girl. I only ever had myself for company, so I took up a hobby that involved being near others.\" I replied. \"Your brother and you… are not so close?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"I was born when he was going into his twenties, he had already started his life by then. But I mean he always looked after me even when he decided to box.\" I replied and I looked at him. \"And you? Do you have siblings?\" I asked and he shook his head. \"I am only child. When I came of age, I go into army and Olympics.\" he answered. I nodded. \"Is that where you met your wife?\" I asked and his smooth lips pierced together and he looked down some. \"Yes. We made a good pair in the media.\" he said. I nodded turning off the main road driving onto the familiar path. \"Did you even like her or did you marry her out of convenience?\" I asked. \"Convenience. She was female champion, I am male champion. It only made sense.\" he announced looking out the window. I nodded. \"I am sorry you are in such a position.\" I replied. \"Don't be. She is not sorry. We have nonverbally agreed that as long as we are not caught with other people we can continue to make the partnership work.\" he said and I arched a brow. So he would not leave her because it would be bad for his image. I only nodded trying to keep some type of distance by using that information. \"So you'll both just sleep around. What if she falls in love with someone else?\" I asked pulling up to a two-story log cabin. He just looked at me. \"She can love in silence.\" he said and I just parked the car before turning it off. Immediately, Ivan leaned over pulled me in to him, but I managed to gather the courage to move back. \"Ivan don't… not in a car.\" I said and he looked down flushed and embarrassed. \" Prosti .\" he whispered before getting out of the car. For the silent but brutal type, Ivan definitely did not know the culture of American women. I didn't know Russia's culture so I was unsure how body language worked there. I got out of the car and led him to the front door. Once I unlocked it, I stepped inside and cut on the nearest lamp revealing a warm living room with nature and family portraits. There was oak furniture and a large TV in front of the sofa and coffee table before us. There was a kitchen in the back and a stair case leading to my room. Apollo never came here for it was my quiet space. I looked up at Ivan and watched as he looked around the room with mild awe. He played the silent type very well. It was warm so I removed my jacket and put it on the coat rack. \"Here let me take your hoody.\" I said and he nodded and removed his shirt revealing the upper layer of his white track suit. His muscles pulsed through the suit and I arched a brow as he gave me his top. \"You wear your jogging suit everywhere?\" I asked staring at the red symbol in the middle of the suit over his chest. He looked down at himself. \"I wear it when I run. I did not lie. I was running before seeing your car.\" he said and I nodded moving into the kitchen. \"Well make yourself at home.\" I said moving to turn on the coffee pot. I stared at it for a moment wondering what to do with him. When I heard nothing, I glanced to see him just standing where I left him looking around the place. It was like he didn't know what to do and truth be told I didn't know either. I sighed and turned toward him. \"What am I going to do with you?\" I asked softly and he watched me and moved toward me. \"I can think of a few ideas.\" he said lowly cornering me now against the counter. I felt my heart fluttering as his light blue eyes saw right through me. I looked away. \"Ivan you're a married man I-\" I was stumbling over my words, but I felt his fingers lightly press into my lips quieting me. He just shook his head, his fingertips lightly rubbing over my soft lips. \"You have such beautiful eyes. And soft lips.\" he said breathlessly and I felt everything disappear inside me once more as he captured my lips with his causing a gentle moan to escape me. I let out a gentle moan. \"Ivan-\" \"Do not worry about meaningless titles. My wife is happy elsewhere. I am happy here.\" he said moving his hands now down my stomach and very easily he unbuttoned my pants and slipped his hand inside causing me to gasp once his cold fingers touched my soft lips. His head forehead pressed into mine and he shook his head. \"You have done nothing wrong.\" God his accent was killing me. I merely touched his face, caressing it as I feel his middle finger slip into my opening causing me to gasp softly. His tongue entered my mouth immediately, and I now wrapped my arms around his neck pulling his strong chest against mine. He growled at the acceptance and quickly lifted me up by my bottom. I gasped holding on to him tighter. \"Where is room?\" he asked and I pointed behind him toward the stairs and he turned and just carried me up the stairs. I giggled softly as he was holding me with ease. He smiled wide and that was the first time he seemed to smile since I had met him. On camera, he was so serious. He showed no emotion no fear. But right now he seemed so human. Once I showed him to my room, he opened the door and went inside. My room was very simple. I had a king size bed, a fully used closet and dresser. A shower was in the back and wide screen TV on a large oak dresser across from my bed. I expected him to drop me on the bed, but instead he just laid me down and slid right on top of me. He curled his fingers into my hair and kissed me again devouring me. I ran my fingers over his chest taking in every crevice of his muscles. He seemed so perfect and carved from marble. I had to feel more. I moved my hand down between our bodies moving my hand beneath his suit, and in seconds, I grip his hard thick shaft and immediately his body jerks and he growls biting down on my bottom lip causing me to moan out. He was so hard already and I bit my lip at the thought of him inside me. Ivan leaned back and hurried to remove his pants and his suit. While he did this, I slid off my pants and then my panties, and I watched his lip curl into a snarl as I did so. I removed my blouse and then my bra and right as I finished undressing myself, he was on top of me once more. I then wanted to test his dominance as I suddenly moved around him and pressed my body against his so he was lying on his back. He smirked and let me be on top, sitting up so his back was against my headboard. I was shocked to see he was willing to share and let me have some dominance. I sat down on his lap, feeling his shaft brushing back and forth against my entrance. I kissed him hard and he wrapped his arms around my waist. His hands caressed and massaged my back. \"So soft.\" he whispered against my lips, his warm breath causing me to shiver. Now I wanted to test his control. I began to slowly move my hips against his, our eyes not leaving one another while the friction between us was built. The head of his cock rubbed against clit causing the pleasure to slowly form in the pit of my stomach and I watched as he panted and moaned lightly. His fingers curled into my hair gripping it and I smiled some moving my hips faster applying more pressure to his hips. Our pants filled the room, and his massive hands groped my breasts and I watched him break eye contact first, by closing his eyes tight as if concentration. \"Gah… if you keep doing that…\" he panted and I kept teasing him trying my best not to lose myself. His head fell back and I took pleasure that I could make him look so helpless and dependent on me. Before I could think, he pushed me back and I fell on my back watching him lift my legs up and spread them. He was on his knees before me, and I watched his face disappear between my legs and before I knew it, I felt his hot tongue licking at my now wet folds, causing my body to jerk, not expecting such actions and now my moaning filled the room. His tongue lapped over my clit numerous times, and I groaned seeing nothing but colors in my head, the pleasure was so great. He was like a dog licking and sucking on my clit like he was trying to take everything from me. I squirmed a bit but his hands on my thighs stopped most movement. I was panting hard and fast as I bit the side of my pointer finger. \"Oh god!\" I cried out. \"Mm you are not the only one who can tease.\" he replied flicking my clit with the tip of his tongue before sliding his body up mine and just hovering over me. \"Now, let us see if I can find that special spot inside you.\" How he said it sounded so sinister that I couldn't help but love his thick dangerous tone even more.[Chapter 6] 6 His eyes captivated me the most even as they were filled with lust. They were so dark and feral. I wanted to look away, but he just had my gaze. He had my body, he had all of me. Ivan was sitting applying pressure to my clit, rubbing it with his large pointer and middle fingers and my fingers gripped the bed sheet as my body arched in pleasure. His tongue slid up and down the back of my neck causing me to shiver and shake violently. No man has ever made me feel like this before it was incredible. \"Oh god!\" I cried out feeling my vagina pulse hard with my third orgasm. I almost collapsed, but Ivan's hand wrapped around my stomach and held me up. We shared a soft laugh before I felt his cock was positioned at my now soaked entrance. But before he entered me, he pulled me up so my back was pressed firmly to his tight and hard chest. I felt the same hand take hold of my jaw and make me look at him, his deep eyes enticing me and he devoured my mouth causing a moan out in utter submission. His arm wrapped around my chest protectively and I felt him stretch me back open causing me to gasp against his lips. I looked up at him and he just stared down at me as he began to thrust his hips up into me, already the tip of his cock was close to that spot inside me. It took only a few seconds before he was pounding away into me and I filled the room with my cries of pleasure and ecstasy. My hands gripped his arm to hold on to and I cried out louder when I felt the head of his cock push against that spot. \"Yes,\" he panted heavily into my ear, his breath hot, \"There it is. There is spot.\" And he was hit it harder and harder with each thrust. I bit my lip hard feeling my body numb almost. \"I will only hit that spot, I will only have you.\" he said in my ear before biting down on the shell of my ear. I yelped out as I was engulfed in a bliss I had never felt before. Everything was building and hitting the invisible ceiling in my body. \"Oh shit!\" I yelled feeling my body explode hard and ripples of overwhelming pleasure took hold of me. It wasn't long before I felt him grunt and growl hard as his cum shot up inside me and we collapsed atop of each other. The blankets were ruined and we were just now panting hard and raggedly. Ivan rolled over and pulled my body over his. I was too weak to fight him at this point. His body was sweaty as was mine. I stared at his creamy chest just accepting that I couldn't fight him, I couldn't deny him. \"Say something… please.\" he said lowly. I looked up at him to see he was staring down at me with concern. \"I can tell you are thinking.\" I nodded and looked down at his chest again. \"I don't like how easily I give in to you.\" I responded, and now his fingers curled under my chin and my face was lifted to meet his eyes and he just stared down at me with half opened eyes. \"And you think you are easy to deny, because you are not.\" he said. I arched brow before shaking my head. \"You don't mean that.\" I said sitting up and now he sat up and nodded. \"This is true.\" he replied firmly and I tilted my head. \"If I asked you not to fight my brother, would you cancel your fight?\" I asked and he winced and looked away. \"That is not fair.\" he said and I sighed and nodded. \"Yes you are right.\" I said and just lied back down on my back and stared at the ceiling. \"My brother will just be one of many fights. In time you will fight others and move on.\" There was silence now and he Ivan lied beside me, his shoulder brushed against mine. \"My offer has not changed.\" he said and now we looked at each other for the longest moment. \"Come with me to Russia.\" I stared at him for a moment actually thinking about it before I looked back up at the ceiling. \"I don't belong in that world.\" I said slowly moving to wrap the blankets over me. Ivan had to shift a bit to let me get in them. I didn't even care if we were lying at the foot of the bed. \"But you belong in mine.\" he said lowly. I heard him but I acted like I didn't. We couldn't do this or at least continue. It could get us both into trouble. I curled up a bit not saying anything else. I felt Ivan's large arm wrap around me, and his body curled around mine and we fell asleep in that position… Three Days Later \" Super highways, coast to coast!\" I could hear James Brown singing at this circus it seemed. It wild and crazy. I was in my favorite white dress with the puffy sleeves with my hair pulled back halfway and flat ironed into tight rings. I got my nails done and made sure to look my best in case cameras were flashing my way. I was moving toward the back tables which were sectioned off from the crowd where the family of the boxing party could sit. But where we were stationed, being Apollo Creed's family were near the front. We could see everything. I however wanted to sit in the crowd where no one else could see me and I was making my way when Mary Ann caught my hand. \"Alicia, sit with me?\" she asked and I could see the worry in her eyes. I too was worried, but I nodded and moved to sit beside her. I noticed Ivan was standing in the middle of the ring as it was ascending from below the ring looking confused at the flashing lights and wild music playing. 'Silly Americans' he must be thinking. I saw his eyes glancing over the crowd from time to time and I wondered what it was he was looking for or who. I didn't see him after our night at the lodge. It was better that way. This entire show was a bad idea. I watched as Ivan's wife, Ludmilla was walking in our direction with Mr. Koloff. When she saw us, she stopped and smiled at Mary Ann. \"I hope after we can be friends.\" she said with a lacey tone. Mary Ann gave a curt nod. \"I hope so.\" she said. Ludmilla nodded. \"Of course their sportsmen not soldiers.\" she said she before extending her hand which my sister in law took. She then looked my way giving a sharp arch of the brow before turning and walking away. I felt my entire body just tense and I looked down hiding the embarrassment I felt. \" Living in America!\" the crowd was now singing as they waved their American flags in our foreign guests face. And now here comes my brother descending down onto the stage on some float with a golden bull's head behind him. He was dancing and showing off like he was used to. I looked over to see Adrienne, Rocky's wife who I had only seen once since I got here examining the entire spectacle. Ivan just stared up at my brother with almost hidden embarrassment. Once the spectacle was over a bell was heard and I just placed my fingers over my head. \"Oh it's just all in good fun.\" Mary Ann said with a smile patting my fingers. I nodded thinking I just wanted this night to be over so we could all just move on and forget this show even happened. Author's notes Here's an update yall gotta give a shout out to my reviewer sheshe073 for keeping me on my toes. I'm a little under the weather, but I'll be updating again most likely tonight and if not tonight then tomorrow definitely.[Chapter 7] 7 I could not hear really what was going on, but I could see the referee was talking to both men who were standing in front of both men. He must have been going over the rules. Apollo looked our way and winked at us and I just gave a smile watching the two. I continued watching seeing Apollo life Ivan's gloves and attempting to touch gloves I assumed, but when Apollo's gloves move to hit Ivan's his gloves remained in place not even moved by Apollo's actions causing a look of mild shock to spread over my brother's face. I was already worried at that moment and the to began to turn from each other. Ivan looked toward the crowd again, before his eyes fell over our table and he saw me. He looked emotionless and strong. I exhaled hoping if he truly fought my brother, he would not hurt him too much. The bell rang and the two began to take off their robes and put in their mouth guards. I curled my fingers in my lap and just watched as the two began to dance around the ring. Apollo looked ready and Ivan was watching him calmly. My brother seemed to be moving fast and Ivan was just following him around attempting to throw punches but never fully engaging him. It wasn't too hard to follow both men's bodies around the ring. Apollo now started to throw punches and they were sticking, but Ivan didn't show much pain to it. The two kept moving about the ring, Apollo egging Ivan on who seemed to just attempt to hit him but not fully try to and I was confused by this action. He was waiting. Apollo was hitting him more and more and for a moment I was unsure if Ivan was really even trying to fight my brother. It wasn't before I heard one of the trainers yelling something that I saw Ivan finally take a violent swing and begin to lay into my brother. My eyes widened and my body convulsed in fear as I watched my brother try and escape his blows, but he wasn't dodging them. He was backed into a corner and my mouth dropped as my hand covered it. It was like seeing a street brawl and this fighting never seemed so real until just now. Ivan threw violent blows that connected into Apollo's sides, his stomach, his face. My heart was pounding and I have never felt a fear so real. Mary Ann's hand struck mind and gripped it hard for she was just as surprised as me. Ivan got Apollo back into a corner after swinging him across the ring and continued to charge his fist into his face. The bell was ringing violently but Ivan did not stop, the rage in his eyes seeping into his punches. \"What is he doing!\" I yelled standing from my seat, the chair almost flipping back. The bell kept ringing to the point Rocky and Dukes was running onto the ring. I could not stand this. I turned and moved from the tables and began to hurry toward the ring. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING! THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXHIBITION!\" Dukes was yelling. I saw Rocky looking at Ivan who just shook his head at him with a smirk and now I was as close as I could. \"Rocky! Is he okay!\" I yelled. He looked over at me with stress in his dark eyes. \"Y-yeah- I don't know!\" he called out and by now security was pulling him away and Apollo was moving to sit down and I could see how bloody his face and I winced now being able to fully see him. \"Apollo please!\" I called out to him, but he just looked at me panting and exhaling blood through his nose. \"Rocky, Rocky don't you let him hurt my brother!\" He needed to stop this fight. He couldn't go on. Not with that beating he just took. I looked at Ivan to see him surrounded by his trainers. I winced and sat back down next to Mary Ann who grabbed my hand quickly. Tears were building in my eyes. Things never got this bad, Apollo was always able to take down an opponent. Apollo glanced our way as he was preparing to get back up. The look of fear and love in our eyes showed and he just raised his fist to us. I looked at Ivan to see him getting back up in the ring. He looked right at me now and he could see it the fear in my eyes. Don't do this. A tear streamed down my face as we just stared at each other and for a split second I thought I saw remorse, but the bell rang, and all looks of sympathy were gone. Back in his warrior mode, Ivan moved to meet my brother. The two began to dance around each other, but Apollo was slow and sluggish in his movements. His punches missed and Ivan looked to be just dancing around him as if nothing could stop him. Apollo threw a punch and missed. Ivan began to whale into him again. No matter how far my brother tried to get away, Ivan was there throwing punches. Now everyone was booing and shouting and I think I heard one woman even scream. \"STOP THE FIGHT!\" Mary Ann yelled standing from her chair. I was stuck in aww at what was happening. I was used to seeing my brother hurt in the ring, but this, this was pure brutality. I immediately saw a younger version of my brother standing in that ring getting knocked down and I felt everything begin to sink into reality. I watched the referee attempt to stop Ivan once he got Apollo in the corner, but Ivan threw him off and continued to brutally beat my brother. I stood from my table in utter fear and terror. \"STOP HIM! SOMEBODY STOP HIM!\" I screamed at the top of my lungs. That's when it happened. Ivan's fist rammed into my brother's face and this time his arms just flailed and my eyes widened as now he just looked limp as he began to fall toward the ground, but this time it was different. I watched as my brother hit the ground and did not move except for his body jerking a bit \"MY GOD!\" Mary Ann screamed and I watched as people ran to the ring flooding it almost immediately and I was just frozen for a split second, before I felt Mary Ann running past me and of course I was right behind her. The entire crowd was in a frenzy as we were trying to fight through them to get to the ring. \"LET ME THROUGH APOLLO!\" This wasn't happening. This wasn't happening. I forced my way through the crowd the maddening crowd tearing at each other to the point my dress sleeve ripped somehow in the process. I couldn't even see until I smacked dead into the ring itself. \"Apollo!\" I screamed. I could hear Rocky demanding an ambulance and I was being pushed by the crowd but I did not move. \"I cannot be defeated.\" I hear Ivan into a microphone. say and I couldn't see him at first, and I didn't want to. I just wanted to see Apollo. I just wanted to see my brother. \"Rocky where is he!\" I screamed for him, but my voice was invisible for all ears as reporters were questioning Rocky. \"Somebody get a doctor in here!\" I heard Rocky. \"Get that light off him!\" \"No!\" I screamed wanting to know something, anything about Apollo. \"I defeat all man.\" Ivan continued and I just felt tear streaming down my face as I made an attempt to climb the ropes to get inside. With the rush I was feeling I managed to get inside. \"Dukes!\" I shouted. \"Alicia! Stay back!\" Dukes shouted running into me and holding me back. \"Where is he!\" I screamed through the crowd. \"Soon I defeat real champion.\" Ivan said full of breath as if not even tired from this fight. I managed to find Rocky and in his arms was Apollo whose eyes were closed, faced drenched in blood and he was not moving. \"Apollo!\" I cried out to him trying to fight Dukes hold to get to him. \"Creed appears to be in very serious condition.\" I heard a reporter say and I closed my eyes not wanting to believe it. \"And if he dies, he dies.\" I heard. My head slowly lifted as I felt my heart sink into the ground beneath my heals. He didn't just say that. He didn't just say that! I wanted this to be a dream. I wanted to wake up and everything be okay. I wanted this pain in my stomach to stop. I just wanted it to all stop… When they pronounced Apollo dead, I just drove away to my lodge and cried. I cried so hard in the darkness of my room. I didn't want to be seen. My phone kept ringing through the entire night into the morning, and so I just took it off the receiver and just cried in the dark. I tore up my room knocking over the dresser and ripping up the sheets and the bed. I wanted to set it on fire. It smelled of everything Ivan and I did nights before and I couldn't believe I had let him in. I did things with him. I ripped up clothes and just sat in the middle of the floor just crying. This was harder just like the horrible moment our mother lost her battle to cancer. It was five in the morning when I decided to drive back to his home. I couldn't leave Mary Ann alone for much longer. I somehow managed to drive back to his house without any issues although, I didn't remember how I really got there- I don't remember the drive. I parked my car to see familiar family cars in the driveway of the house. I slowly opened the door and got out. I began to walk to the front door only to see it open and Mary Ann come out with wet eyes. I just stared up at her for a moment before we moved and embraced each other crying into one another's shoulders. Rocky and Adrian came out shortly after and embraced us. Author's Notes Man this was a rough chapter to type because I get into my feelings with my stuff especially sad stuff. Like dang how is Ivan going to even apologize for this... or will he?[Chapter 8] 8 Normal POV Everyone was drinking and partying tonight at the hotel the Russian boxer and his trainers, because of his victory over the senior boxer, Apollo Creed. He was not a worthy opponent and he should not have been put in Ivan's line of sight. He was a champion of Russia and he was indeed a has been. But even in this moment, Ivan was already feeling regret. As everyone celebrated and Koloff spoke to reporters boasting about Ivan, Ivan was taking a cold shower. He just stood there staring at the white tiles in front of him. He was use to war and the deaths that came with it, but he had never killed anyone in the ring. He was incredibly numb and all he could picture was her face. Not his wife's face, but Alicia's face. Ivan would be lying if he admitted to feeling bad about winning, but he didn't. He was happy for his victory, but he also knew in his mind that it was not worth losing a woman he was so obsessed with. She was nothing like her brother. He was arrogant and foolish. This victory tonight opened America's eyes to the fact that it is not the only country that breeds champions. But even through his prideful thoughts, he saw her face. The tears that streamed down her face tonight as she begged him with her big brown eyes not to continue this fight. Ivan wanted nothing more than to jump out of the ring and wipe her tears away, but his duty to his country filled his mind at the sound of that bell and he knew he had to do what must be done. He wanted to win, but he did not want to kill the old man, no matter how much he rubbed his legend in Ivan's face. He growled and hit the wall with the palm of his hand. He was having a mental battle in his mind. On one hand, he pleased his people and on the other he just ripped out a woman's heart that he cared so deeply for. He looked down at his body, cock always rising at the thought of the chocolate skinned woman. He winced in disgust with himself. The steroids were doing this to him, which is what made him feel even more disgusted. He would have to her again. He couldn't stay away, he had to show her that he didn't mean to kill her brother. But he knew all too well that that wouldn't do anything, but he had to try. The curtains glided open and Ludmilla stepped in. Ivan opened his eyes and watched casually and let the water run over her short golden locks. Ivan just watched her quietly. \"You have nothing to be ashamed of. You won. That is all that matters.\" she said dryly turning to look at him, her petite body facing his larger one. She had small curves and hips. When they used to have sex, Ivan felt he would break his wife, because she was so small. But not Alicia. She had curves, her hips he could grab firmly. Ivan looked away trying to control himself. Ludmilla arched a brow as she looked down at his cock as it firmly at attention. \"Is that for me… or her?\" she asked. Ivan shot her a glare before getting out of the shower and wrapping a towel swiftly around his waist. \"She is quite beautiful. I can see why you want her… and why she used to want you.\" Ivan just stormed out of the bathroom blocking out her words. Alicia's POV Rocky gave a good speech at Apollo's funeral. I stood with Adrian and Mary Ann and I just looked at the coffin my brother was in. I felt like I wasn't even here. I didn't think anything, I didn't feel anything. I didn't want to exist right now. Apollo was the last person that kept me going and tied to this earth. Now I felt alone truly I did. After the funeral, everyone talked and gave their condolences to our family. When they finally put him into the ground, I was the last to leave. I remained in the church staring up at the golden cross that just stared down at me. \"Apollo was a good man. He was like a brother to me.\" Rocky said his hand resting on my shoulder and I nodded slowly and stiffly. \"Just don't you go dying anytime soon.\" I whispered turning to look at him and he looked stunned. \"You and Adrian and Mary Ann are all I have left. If anything were to happen to you guys I-\" Already my voice was breaking and tears were falling down my cheeks. Immediately, he grabbed me and pulled me in to him hugging me tight. I just hugged him hard and tight taking comfort in his warmth. \"Hey hey we ain't goin' nowhere.\" he said lowly. I nodded and just cried into his suit. After a few minutes, I pulled back and just moved toward the front of the church again. \"I need some time alone. I'll head back to Mary Ann's later.\" I responded. \"You sure, you know I can stay with you. You've been alone for a long time.\" he said and I nodded. \"I just want to feel connected to my brother for as long as I can today.\" I said looking back at him and he just looked down for a moment and nodded. \"Yeah okay. Just… if you feel you want to talk let me know. I'm here, you know Adrian's here, we're all here.\" he said. I nodded and gave a gentle smile before he nodded and left the church. The doors were pinned open letting in the warmth of outside. I just turned and stared up at the cross once more getting lost in my thoughts. I remember watching Apollo train and how bruised he would be after a fight whether it was street fighting or boxing with Dukes. He always had heart. I remember punching a few with him when I was younger. 'Yeah she a Creed, she's gonna be a champion like her big brother' He would boast to his buddies. I don't know how long I was staring at that cross until I saw the large reflection of someone in the door way. I closed my eyes feeling my body stiffen and my heart pound with rage and fear. A single tear slipped down my eyes and down my cheek as I knew who stood there. \"You cannot be defeated.\" I said softly, but loud enough that he could hear. I saw the figure step in and the arms were stretching and I could hear the doors magnet unclicking and in seconds I heard the doors shut. \"You defeat all man.\" I said a bit louder hearing his footsteps approaching me and I did not move still. I closed my eyes as anger laced in my words now. \"And soon you will defeat a real champion.\" I slowly turned to see Ivan standing there, face soft as if that's the only way he can show remorse or sympathy. He was in his captain's uniform, hat firmly pressed under his arm. Was this his way of showing respect. \"And if he dies, he dies.\" I repeated his words to him and I watched a twinge of pain appear on of his face before it vanished again. What was he even doing here? He took his hat and tossed it on the nearest pew. He moved upon me with such swiftness that I couldn't process his movements. I moved back as quick as I could, but his hands cupped my face and he kissed me, but it was not hard and dominating. It was soft and sincere. \"I'm sorry.\" he whispered against my lips and I felt panic over take me as he suddenly kissed me again. \"I'm so so sorry.\" My stomach tightened and I felt immediate anger fill me, but it wasn't at him. It was at me, because I could hear how sincere he was and how sorry he was…and I believed him. I pushed at his chest trying to get him off so I could get away from him, but he would not budge. He wrapped his arms around my hips and pulled me into him and I continued to pound and bang on his chest trying to get out of his hold to the point he had my body against one of the pews. I was now crying harder than I had ever cried. I stopped hitting his chest after my arms got tired and just cried into his uniform, his hand lightly curling into my hair. I hated that he was here comforting me, the man who killed my brother! This was it, this was the end for us. I slowly pulled back and just stared at his chest. \"You have to go.\" I whispered. He shook his head. \"No. I won't abandon you.\" he whispered holding me tighter and I just looked up at him with wide eyes. \"Don't you get it? We are enemies now. You did this! You killed my brother! You hurt me! I- I have to hate you now!\" I yelled trying to pry his arms off me and he shook his head firmly once more my movements not even phasing him. \"Then hate me until you love me again.\" he said before kissing me again. My body was wracked with feelings and emotions so much that I lost my footing and fell back. I tried to catch myself on the aisles. My legs tangled with Ivan's as my body was panicking from the fall and now we both fell right between the aisles.[Chapter 9] 9 I thought I would hit the back of my head square on the ground, but Ivan wrapped his arms around my back and with his other hand his hand rested in my hair to cushion my fall. He tightened his body so his large form would not fall on me. I was panting from the panic of the fall and I just stared up at him as he stared down at me and I was just at a loss of words for a moment. I could see his eyes looking down at my lips. \"Try it and I'll bite you.\" I said with a bit of snarl and his eyes snapped up and locked on my face and he slowly shook his head. \"I did not mean to kill him… what I said in ring was-\" \"True. It was for political gain and Ivan you gained it big time.\" I said my eyes swelling with tears and he just shook his head. \"I did not want this to happen.\" he said and I just looked away. \"Please get off me.\" I said and immediately his weight was gone off me for a second and I sat up slowly as he stood over me. He raised his hands for me to take and I slowly stood on my own. He looked genuinely hurt and now I just stared up at him. \"You have to go.\" I said. \"No.\" he stated firmly and I shook my head holding my pointer finger up. \"You don't get to be here for me. You have not earned the right.\" I said and he looked down as if he was a child being scolded. \"Da. You are right.\" he said softly looking up at me. \"I thought I was entitled to things when I got here. I thought I could win and have you at the same time. I did not expect to kill your brother during our fight. But I cannot take it back.\" I just stared at him no comfort coming from his words. \"So what you came to pay your respects? Because my brother isn't in this church he in the ground outside.\" I said pointing to the closed doors. He ducked his head some as his eyes followed my fingers. I nodded slowly. \"Right, because what would that look like, the Russian boxer coming to pay respects to famous boxer Apollo Creed. It would raise so many questions.\" Immediately he took my hands in his and holding them to his chest. \"And I would do it if it would bring you even an inkling of peace.\" he said kissing the tops of my fingers and I just wince and how passionate he could be right now. But I knew I could not ask him to do that. The publicity it would bring and the rumors it would spread. I would never have peace. I closed my eyes and looked away slowly. \"I look at your face and I see the truth in your eyes… I see the regret and pain you feel.\" I said slowly opening my eyes and now looking back at him. \"But I also see my brothers bloody face and your fist causing that blood. I see his life ending when you closed his eyes.\" I could see the pain that formed in his eyes and he watched as I slid my hands from his hold and they just slipped through his hold and I backed away from moving toward the doors. \"Go away Ivan… stay away.\" I said shaking my head at him and he just watched with pain in his eyes as they were in my eyes as well. I just turned and left the church. Days past into weeks and after settling everything with my brother's will, I stayed with Mary Ann, because she did not want to be alone. Soon it was like Apollo never existed. I brought Mary Ann some breakfast and sat with her in her bed while she ate. She was a wreck and I would see her through it as much as I could. She ran her fingers through her hair. \"How did it come to this?\" she asked with a tired tone. I shook my head unable to answer and she looked at me with red eyes. \"Was it foolish of me to think that somehow Apollo would…. In a different way?\" She couldn't even say the word. I winced holding her hand. \"I thought maybe he would get a sickness or if the lord was willing, he would die of natural causes in his old age.\" she said her voice cracking and tears streaming down her face. I closed my eyes and looked away unable to look her in the face. Shame was spreading over my face. I embraced her for a few minutes before leaving her to sleep. I was walking to the front door and opened it to see Rocky with his fist up about to knock on it. I smiled. \"Hey.\" Replied softly and he smiled. \"Hey. How is she doing?\" he asked motioning his head over me. I nodded. \"She's getting there.\" I responded and he nodded and looked at me worriedly. \"Yeah how 'bout you?\" he asked. I nodded slowly. \"I'm getting there.\" I said gently and he nodded. \"Well I was just stopping by to see if you all needed anything.\" he said and I shook my head. \"We're good.\" I lied. Truth be told, I didn't know what I needed at the moment. He nodded and ran his fingers through his hair. \"Yeah… you know it's like a bad dream, I try and wake up each time and it never seems to work.\" he said. I nodded and looked down. \"No matter how many times you try and change the outcome it just doesn't change.\" I agreed and he nodded. \"Yeah…well if you need anything call me.\" he said and I nodded and he left just like that. I returned to my quiet little cabin and checked the mail as I was used to. I found another small white envelope with no name or address on it. I knew who it was from. His face was painted everywhere on the TV. The Russian boxer was getting publicity as if he were my brother. I heard no one would challenge him and of course Koloff was boasting at how afraid we Americans were. I walked into the cabin and placed the letter on the table with the other 12 letters. I couldn't open them. It would feel like even bigger betrayal to my brother if I did. Once I was in my room, now cleaned up, I showered and got dressed up in one of my black dresses. I just wanted a drink. I pinned my hair up, slid on my sparkling heals, and left back into town. I went inside the first bar I could find. It was busy and loud and somehow I tuned it out. I ordered scotch and as much I wanted to down it and others after it, I knew I had to drive and I was by myself so I didn't want to make myself vulnerable to the lecherous men who came over and asked me out numerous times. I just wanted to feel different on the outside than how I felt on the inside. It was getting dark, and I didn't know what time it was. I didn't care really. I gently sipped my drink knowing I should probably down it, but I don't know alcohol. I was a moscato girl really. \"You know a pretty girl shouldn't be drinking alone.\" I hear a smooth talking man say. I looked over my shoulder to see a tall, dark and handsome man staring down at me flashing me a smile. I shrugged. \"I prefer being alone.\" I said turning back to my drink, but he leaned over the table. \"Hey now what's got a cute face like you so down?\" he asked. 'My brother was murdered by a man I was surprisingly in love with.' I slowly looked at him with a death glare. \"You don't even want to know. Now please leave me alone.\" I said trying to get lost in the crappy bar music I was hearing. Now I felt a hot hand on the small of my back. \"Now come on sugar, let me buy you a drink and help you forget about this night.\" he said. A taller figure came up behind him and I watched as a smooth white hand landed on the man's right shoulder causing him to jump from utter shock and look over his shoulder to see the blue eyed Russian devil. He was in his sweat pants and hoody. My eyes flexed as I could see the blankness in his eyes as he stared at the guy. \"The woman is not interested.\" he said coldly, his accent heavy and angry. The stranger looked him over as if trying not to show how intimidated he was. \"Ay man why don't you back off. This ain't got nothing to do with you. Get your own girl.\" he said aggressively. I arched a brow impressed with his attitude. He obviously didn't know who he was talking to. Ivan looked up and rolled his eyes before just moving around the man, his shoulder clearly knocking him out of the way before he grabbed me and swung me over his shoulder causing me to gasp at how easy it was to just man handle me. Ivan glared at the man. \"She IS my girl.\" he stated before carrying me from the bar, and it seemed no one was going to stop him either. Once we were out of the bar, I began to struggle. \"Put me down!\" I snapped and he did so quite easily. I backed away from him. \"What are you doing here? Are you following me?\" I asked and he shook his head. \"Went for a job. I promise. Came to get…water.\" he said looking the bar over with mild disgust and I just stared at him. I didn't care if he was telling the truth or not. I just turned and began to move down the sidewalk in the direction of the car. Ivan began to follow me. \"Stop following me.\" I said. \"No. It is late. Women should not be walking alone.\" he said and I just scoffed. \"Oh now you care?\" I asked. \"I have always cared.\" he said. Sadly, I wanted his company up to my car. I had to walk through an alleyway to get here and during the day it was okay, but now I couldn't be sure. \"Say something please.\" \"What do you want me to say?\" I asked looking up at him. He shrugged. \"That you hate me, that you want to hurt me or you want me to die. Anything to get your pain out.\" he said. I shook my head. \"My pain was buried with my brother and I would never wish death upon anyone. My brother died doing what he loved, even if he was retired.\" I said gently and quietly. \"But you do hate me.\" he said watching me and I just looked up at him as I turned the corner into the wide alley way. \"Doesn't matter. Soon you will go back to Russia a hero.\" I said and now I felt his hand grab mine and gently he backed me into the wall. \"You will always matter, Alicia. No matter how much time goes on, you will always matter to me.\" he said and I looked away shaking my head trying to block out his sinful voice. \"You should say that to your wife.\" I said. \"Then it would be a lie. My wife knew about us.\" he said and I looked up at him now quickly. \"How?\" I asked and he smiled and slowly pressed my hand to his lips kissing them causing a bolt of electricity shoot up my spine. A feeling entered my body that I had not felt in a long time. Now he pressed my hand to his nose and inhaled. \"Your scent is very intoxicating and noticeable and mixed with the sex we ad… it will never go away.\" he said lowly, and I knew that tone all too well. \"A-and I assume you didn't deny any accusations?\" I asked and he looked at me slowly let my hand go. \"I did not.\" he said and I shrugged quickly. \"It doesn't matter. It's all the past.\" I said and he nodded very slowly and looked down. \"Yes. She likes to remind me.\" he said lowly. I looked him over not knowing what to say. I wouldn't admit anything that would cause him to take advantage of me. Like he would ever do that, no he just had to touch me and I would melt again. \"Let's just get me to my car please?\" I asked and began to turn from him. \"Hey home boy!\" I heard someone yell and we both whipped our heads back to see the guy from the bar coming down the alley with a few men behind him. \"Yo we got some unfinished business!\" My eyes widened as I watched the men stalk down the ally. My heart began to pound hard in my chest and before I knew it, Ivan's hand had pushed me slowly behind him. He was so large, I almost couldn't see the other men coming to look for trouble. Author's Notes Hello yall here's an update, hope everyone is enjoying the story. Also, I will be updating suicide squad very soon and other fanfics![Chapter 10] 10 Ivan blocked my view of the four men who confronted us and I swallowed some glancing over his side to see them approaching. \"You talk a lot of shit. Now let's see if you can walk that walk.\" the man threatened and I felt Ivan push gently against my stomach to back me away from him. \"Gentlemen, you do not want problem.\" Ivan said and the man laughed. \"You hear that boys, the foreigner says \"We don't want no problem\".\" he taunted causing everyone to laugh and Ivan just glared at them. I pressed my back to the nearest wall and made sure I was out of the way. Ivan began to remove his hoody and I watched as he revealed, this time, a white wife beater that definitely complimented his rock wall abs. I swallowed and watched as the man pulled out a knife and soon the other men followed his actions. \"Ivan.\" I said nervously, fear laced in my tone. But Ivan just stood there with a glare on his face and his fists slowly began to tighten and the man who was talking the most mess lunged at him with the knife, but Ivan grabbed his arm which held the knife and he maneuvered his arm down and in one powerful move, his fist collided and I heard the man's nose break instantly. My eyes widened as I could see Apollo's face flashing in my mind almost like a reminder. I swallowed hard as I heard the man screaming. Ivan released him and he backed away into the nearest wall yelling hard as he touched his nose. \"FUCKING KILL THIS FOREIGN MOTHER FUCKER!\" he shouted and three other men came at once, and I watched as Ivan threw punch after punch after punch and they were vicious. Even as a few of the men managed to cut him, he didn't even seem to care. He punched the second guy so hard in the stomach he fell down and didn't get back up. The third man slashed his blade against his right shoulder blade. Ivan just looked over his shoulder and suddenly uppercut him square in the jaw and sent the man flying down to my feet, unconscious. I jumped at the sight and the last man, well he dropped his knife, raised his hand and took off running. I was just left standing there watching as Ivan just placed his jacket back on and he moved over to me raising his hand to me. \"Come.\" he said gently and I looked at his hands, his knuckles not even shaking or bruised from the fight, and slowly I placed my hand in his. He pulled me closer to him and that's when I saw the cuts on his body. \"You're hurt.\" I said and he looked over his shoulder and I remembered the large cut on his shoulder. \"Come on.\" I pulled him in the direction of my car and he followed without question. I got him into my car and drove him back to my cabin. Once we were in the parking lot I cut off my car and turned to look at him. He was just staring out the front window, his face mildly sweating. I just looked him over before slowly getting out of the car. I didn't know what I should say to him. As we both closed the door, I moved over to him and just placed my hands on his jacket stopping him. He stopped and looked down at me curiously, eyes showing mild exhaustion. I looked up at him. \"Thank you.\" I said gently and he just nodded. \"Da.\" he replied and I nodded and moved him into the cabin. I switched into more comfortable clothes which was just a red faded gown. Ivan sat in a chair in the kitchen and I was behind him cleaning his wounds and even stitching up the wound in the back and putting some ointment on it that would stop any infection. \"Where you learn this?\" Once his shoulder was done, I turned and faced him and began to bandage the cut over his arm. I glanced up at him and then back down. \"Apollo was always in fights even if they were not in the ring. Our mother was sick herself and couldn't always help, so I learned from watching the doctors clean him up. Then I started to clean him up when I got older.\" I explained and he nodded slowly looking down. I gathered up the dirty pads and moved to throw them away, but Ivan grabbed my hand slowly and I stopped and looked down at him and he just stared up at me. \"Thank you.\" he said and I gave a polite stare. \"Da.\" I answered gently and I watched him smile slowly and release me and I threw the bandages away. Now what? What was I going to do with him now? I moved back over to him to see he was putting his jacket back on and I shook my head. \"Oh no you cannot wear that. I need to wash it. It was on the ground and could give you infections.\" I said moving over to him and he paused and just gave a look of disbelief. \"Like something so little could get me sick.\" he said and I arched a brow. \"Why because you are invincible?\" I asked and he almost answered, but he stopped himself for a moment and looked away. I raised my hands to him. \"Gimme.\" He sighed and handed it to me and I nodded. \"Go sit down and rest. When the jacket is clean I will give it back and I can give it back to you.\" I said and he looked almost stunned. \"You want me here?\" he asked and I just bit the inside of my cheek and shrugged. \"For now.\" I responded and he just nodded and moved into my living room. I found myself watching him leave and noticed his pants were also dirty. \"Wait. Give me your pants, too. You will not sit on my couch with dirty clothes.\" Ivan raised his hands as if a gun had been pointed at him and began to remove his shoes and take off his pants. I knew I was putting myself up for temptation for now that he was just in his wife beater and white and red boxers. I just took his pants and moved to the laundry room. I placed them in the wash and just closed it. I placed my hands on the top of the washer and just stared out into space for a moment. \"Is this how things will be?\" I jumped and turned to see Ivan just standing the doorway joining the darkness of the room and I turned to him as he moved further into the room. His eyes were deep and mysterious almost. \"With us? Will we just be meeting in secret and acting as if we are awkward friends.\" I arched a brow. \"This will not happen again. This night was all just coincidence. I couldn't just let you leave injured.\" I said and suddenly he was standing over me, my bottom now hitting the washer and his arms resting on either side of it. \"But you could have.\" he whispered and I tensed as I looked up at him. \"All my injuries are… minor. I could have walked you to car and then left. But you took me here.\" I shrugged. \"You came willingly. You could have said no and left.\" I countered and now he shook his head. \"But you knew I would never deny your wishes.\" he said leaning in to me now, his chest pressing into my own causing my breasts to push upward a bit and I felt my heart beating fast and my vagina already starting to throb slightly. \"I will never deny you.\" I felt his tongue suddenly slide up my neck and a violently shiver shot up my body and I could not stop the unexpected whimper from escaping me. I swallowed hard shutting my eyes and I exhaled weakly and slowly my hand began to move up and curl into his hair. \"Don't.\" I said gently feeling his face come up to mine, and they were focused on me and he was so close almost inches from my face. So close he managed to run his tongue over my top lip causing me to become undone. 'Don't do that' I thought to myself. \"Tell me to stop, Licia.\" he whispered gently and lustfully as he kissed the tip of my nose. \"Tell me to never touch you again. Tell me to never hold you again.\" I felt his fingers were already pressed between my legs and slowly he began to gently rub my clit through my panties. He leaned back and looked down at me, his eyes showing seriousness now. \"Tell me to never fuck you again.\" he said and I stared up at him for a moment thinking carefully about my next words. I took hold of his face. \"Never fuck me again.\" I said before pulling him into a violent kiss of which he responded to immediately. He could hear the lies in my voice as I said this, because it was a lie. I didn't want him to fuck me tonight. I pulled back and looked him in his eyes. \"But make love to me tonight.\"[Chapter 11] 11 It was only mere seconds before we were both in my room on my bed, his body atop of mine, his lips devouring mine. My fingers moved through his hair, and he moaned against my lips as bodies just emerged together. He peeled away at my clothes and I did the same. His body heat and scent washed over me and engulfed me. There was no running from it or hiding the need for them both. We're not indestructible, Baby better get that straight I think it's unbelievable How you give into the hands of fate His mouth found my neck and he ran his tongue up and down that sweet spot on the side of my neck and he sucked hard causing my eyes to roll to the back of my head. Oh the feelings that formed in my body were amazing. Some things are worth fighting for some Feelings never die I'm not askin' for another chance I just want to know why His body moved between mine and I felt his hands curl into the blankets beside me as I could only hear panting around us. In one push, he was inside me and I gasped out feeling my walls wrap around his shaft instantly. It was like he fit perfectly inside me. There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home There's no easy way out givin' in can't be wrong The room was filled once more with steady pants and grunts as he pushed steadily inside me in and out and in and out. I whimpered and wrapped my legs around his hips as his knuckles turned white from gripping the sheets. I could feel him holding back. All the muscle in his body was screaming for him to move harder and faster and basically destroy me. But he didn't. He groaned and grunted as one of his hands pressed against my headboard and gripped it hard. I don't want to pasify you I don't want to drag you down But I'm feelin like a prisoner Like a stranger in a no named town I see all the angry faces Afraid that could be you and me Talkin about what might have been I'm thinkin about what I used to be Our bodies moved in perfect sync with one another and I could feel the familiar sensations ringing inside my body. It's missed him so much and truth be told so did I. There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home Ther's no easy way out givin' in can't be wrong As he thrust inside me, his other hand held my hips and he guided my body to match his thrusts and as he did this I just focused on his eyes even though they were shut and I was watching him maintain control. As I watched his face, I thought about the past events both the good and the bad. I remember all the matches my brother had won even when Rocky came into his life. I remember our times together whenever I came to visit. Without Apollo, that was gone. But what was left of me here? Could I ever have a true future with Ivan like my brother had with Mary Ann or even the relationship Rocky has with Adrian? Baby, baby we can shed this skin We can know how we feel inside Instead of goin' down and endless road Not knowin if we're dead or alive I could see myself in the future with Ivan, our hands intertwined in public and no one would say a thing about it. We would be somewhere in Russia, and he would be twirling me around in the snow declaring his love for me. Then I would be in a hospital bed waiting for them to bring in the baby he and I finally had together. Ivan would be smiling with pride and love for us both. I would be foolish to think he would somehow get along with Rocky and the others and we would somehow be a family again. Some things are worth fightin for Some feelings never die I'm not askin for another chance I just want to know why There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home There's no easy way out givin in givin in can't be wrong no I could feel his thrusts grow a bit more forceful, which only caused more shocks of pleasure to grow inside me. I could tell he was reaching his limits. My mind began to fade back to the fight with he and Apollo, and now I tried to shut my eyes and shut out his face. I was seeing Rocky's face, and Mary Ann's and even Adrian's. I could picture my own face as I shouted in horror for someone to stop the fight. Ivan's hand suddenly gripped my chin lightly and I looked up at him. \"Come back to me.\" he said roughly and I looked up at him to see him staring down at me. \"Come back to me.\" I replied by kissing him lovingly. There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home There's no easy no easy no easy way out There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home There's no easy way out givin in givin in can't be wrong no There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home There's no easy no easy no easy way out His back arched and he growled lowly as I felt him explode inside me and I panted softly and heavily feeling my orgasm hit me. We lied beneath the blankets and I just rested my cheek on his chest listening to his heart beat. So the soldier does have a heart. I sighed softly causing Ivan to stir. \"What is it?\" he asked and I shook my head, causing his hand to gently curl under my chin and directing my eyes to him. He was like a god looking down on me with a lust filled gaze. \"I want no secrets from us…ever.\" I took in his words and slowly sat up. \"What happens after tonight?\" I asked gently. He sat up and looked down on me. \"I come to you when you need me.\" he said and I was going to say something before my landline began to ring and I jumped a bit and Ivan just rubbed my arm to settle me before I got up and moved to answer the phone. \"Hello?\" I asked. \"Hey, Alicia.\" It was Rocky. \"Hey. Are you okay?\" I asked. \"Yeah… I'm gonna do it, Alicia… I'm gonna fight Drago.\" Was his only response. Author's notes Sorry for the slow updates, I am under the weather and getting over a full week of virus and sicknesses. I will try and update more, but hopefully you guys are good at imagining this montage. While Rocky was having his car ride, this is what was going on with Ivan.[Chapter 12] 12 \"Wh-what?\" I asked gently turning my body from Ivan so his naked form would not distract me from this conversation. I doubt it really could after hearing what Rocky said, but he was pitching an impressive tent in my blankets still, so I was trying not to pay attention. \"Yeah. I'm going to make an announcement and have them set it up.\" he said, and I was going to reply but I jumped a bit feeling Ivan's body pressing up against mine. His arms wrapped around my hips and I could feel him slowly rubbing his hips against mine as he pulled my body further into his. \"Um, Rocky… I don't know what to say.\" I said. Ivan stopped his motions for a split second before moving his lips to my neck and gently kissing it. \"I know. It's a lot to take in and it's late. So, I was thinking maybe we can get together tomorrow at my place and we discuss some things.\" he offered, and I tried to move from Ivan's hold, but he wasn't having it. He held me closer to his body and I sighed softly. \"Okay sure. Tomorrow it is.\" I replied. \"Good night.\" I hung up the phone and exhaled sharply finally taking in his words. For once, Ivan's form of distraction had no effect on me. \"Rocky is going to fight you.\" I replied and Ivan paused this time before slowly leaning his face back to look at me. \"He will lose.\" he responded and I looked at him. \"You're not afraid?\" I asked and he shook his head. \"I fear noth-\" he paused in his words and looked down. \"That would be lie, fearing nothing. I feared I would never see you again after the church.\" I only looked down and I just swallowed some. \"So you're going to fight him then?\" I asked and he looked at me. \"If he comes forward then yes.\" he said. Will you kill him too, I wanted to ask, but I kept my thoughts to myself and Ivan's fingers curled under my cheek and he guided my eyes to his. \"I will not kill him.\" I shook my head looking away and slowly moving from his hold. \"You cannot promise this.\" I said and I felt his large hand curl around my own to stop me and I turned and looked at him. \"But I can… when I fought your brother, I was angry at his show boating. I wanted to show him, that my country, that I was not someone to underestimate. I did not mean to kill him then and I will not kill your friend.\" he explained. As he spoke about my brother I felt my eyes water and a tear slipped down my cheek, and he slowly wrapped his arms around me and pulled me in to him, our chests colliding softly, his thumb wiping my cheek. His eyes were so sincere and soft. He was so different from how he looked when the cameras and media was in front of him. He was so emotionless, but here it seemed he poured all of his emotions out to me. \"You will always have something to prove… glory and fame is all you will ever want for you country, and why shouldn't you? You are a soldier you should always want to stand up for your country.\" I said and Ivan just shook his head wiping another tear that had fallen. \"Glory and fame is not all I desire.\" he said before leaning down and kissing me hard. It almost took the breath from my lungs as I wrapped my hands around his neck pulling him in to me. \"Let's go.\" He said into my lips and I looked him over a bit. \"Go where?\" I asked and he shook his head. \"Away from here.\" he said now suddenly placing his hands under my bottom and lifting me into the air. I gasped as my legs wrapped around his hips and he just shook his head. \"We run away together. No one find us.\" he said and my eyes widened almost as he said this. Ivan Drago, Russia's champion and military idol, would run away with the famous Apollo Creed's sister? \"Where would we go?\" I asked as he just carried me around the room smiling up at me. \"Anywhere you want, we go. I see a… perfect world when I stare into your eyes.\" he said. Who knew that the silent champion had such a way with words and I just placed my hands on his cheeks massaging them as he leaned in to my touch. \"I love you. I cannot go back to Russia without you.\" I just looked down at him unable to believe what he had just said and I was just in his hold staring down at him and I just closed my eyes and placed my forehead into his. \"I love you... but you have to fight Rocky.\" I said and he stared up at me almost confused. \"You want this?\" he asked. If we ran away, he would be throwing away his life for me and I could not ever ask anyone to do that for me. This was his dream, his love. \"You are a fighter, Ivan. This is your passion. I could not ask you to desert your country for me. You have come so far to just throw it all away for me. I want you to fight if you want. And if you still want me in the end, I am yours.\" I said and he looked down a bit in thought before slowing sitting down on the bed with me now on his lap. \"Then I fight, Balboa for you.\" he said, and I nodded and kissed him lovingly and he returned it just as quickly. Author's Notes I kind of teared up writing this scene. But alas this story is soon going to end and so I am going to be finishing up this fic and the suicide fic. I am thinking of writing a disney fanfic rated m of course for the new Beauty and the Beast, because I didn't fully like the movie, and I think I can make a good one, but we shall see. Anyways, enjoy![Chapter 13] 13 The next morning, I opened the door for Ivan as he was dressed and standing in the doorway looking down at me. It was chilly today. We stared at each other for a long moment and Ivan's head tilted down some. \"Good bye.\" he lowly and I nodded gently. \"Good bye.\" I responded softly, and he began to move down my porch steps some and I just watched for a moment before looking down feeling overwhelming sadness. I felt like after this, we would be back on fighting sides, me with Rocky and him with his country, where we both should be. I felt like I would never see him again. I then look up to see Ivan moving back up to me quickly, and I was stunned by his actions as he pulled me into a tight embrace and I wrapped my arms under his and buried my face into his chest. His scent washed over me so quickly. We pulled back just a bit so we could look at one another and share one final kiss, for who knows what will happen after today. His lips were soft and gentle and he slowly pulled back licking his lips gently. \"No matter what happens… I do this for you.\" he said gently and I nodded feeling soft tears slip down my face and he just pressed his forehead into mine and we just stayed like this for a moment. The next day I was surrounded by flashing lights of cameras as I was allowed to sit next to Rocky as the press conference took place about the… fight between Rocky and Ivan. Rocky was asked about his title, any money being given, where and when the fight was taking place. In Russia, I was secretly shocked that Rocky agreed. \"We fight in Soviet Union or we fight nowhere.\" Koloff said and now more questions were asked and I was just staring off into space a bit before glancing over at Rocky and then at Ivan who kept a straight face, his eyes looking forward. But I knew he felt my gaze on him. I knew it when he let his eyes drift off in my direction without really looking at me. \"Why don't you ask Drago's wife why she is afraid. Tell them please.\" Ludmilla looked at the heavy crowd. \"I'm afraid for my husband's life.\" she started yet everyone groaned as if not believing her. \"We have threats of violence everywhere. We are not politics. All I want is for my husband to be safe and to be treated fairly.\" Ivan looked around the room as if bored by this mindless talk. \"You call him a killer. He's a professional fighter not a killer. You have this belief that you are better than us. You have this belief that this country is so very good and we are so very bad.\" She said, but she was not winning over the American crowd who bombarded her with more questions and groans. \"You have this belief that you are so very fair and we are so very cruel.\" I was beginning to feel overwhelmed and just as I was making a slight move to get up, my name was called. \"Ms. Apollo do you have any comments?\" a reporter asked and now all attention was on me and Ivan now looked in my direction. Rocky grabbed my hand slowly now as if for encouragement. \"What?\" I asked softly. \"Do you agree with this fight that is going to take place on Christmas in Russia?\" another asked. \"Will you be going with Rocky to see him face your brother's killer.\" Now the room quieted and I just felt so out of place here. I looked at Rocky who just gave me a light glance and then I looked over at the Drago couple and then at Ivan and I looked down for a moment before looking forward. \"This fight whether Rocky wins or Mr. Drago wins, it will not bring my brother back. I say to those who have sent threats to the Drago's to please do not show such disrespect to our foreign guests,\" I started and Ivan looked down at the table in front of him as his hardened face cracking some. \"My brother died in the ring where he had built his legacy and I forgive Ivan Drago for killing him.\" Now soft gasps were heard and Ivan looked up at me quite quickly with visible shock on his face. \"Ms. Creed will you be attending the fight in Russia?\" the reporter asked and I looked at the cameras and nodded. \"Yes. I will be supporting Rocky and his team. But I know I cannot stay in the cabin he wishes to train at. It would be too sad. So I will be getting a hotel in the city until this business is finished.\" I explained. More questions were thrown at me and I just nodded and looked over at Ivan to see him staring at me with what looked like his usual facial glare, but I could see he was quite pleased with my rooming arrangements. After the conference, I went to visit Mary Ann and she was quiet, but leaving her room. We sat in the kitchen and I watched her drink tea. Or she tried to. She mainly stared at the tea, her eyes soft and dull. \"Do YOU have to go?\" she asked and I looked at her wondering what I should say. \"Yes. I have to see this happen.\" I replied and she nodded slowly a single tear falling down her cheek. \"Promise me you'll come back.\" she said and I looked at her with a tilt of my head. \"Why would you think I wouldn't?\" I asked and suddenly her body flailed it seemed as she slammed her cup down on the ground. \"WHY DO YOU THINK ALYCIA! BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO RUN AWAY WITH THAT RUSSIAN!\" she screamed and my eyes widened as I stood up from my chair in shock. \"What, do you think I wouldn't find out! I have seen every press conference with you two in the same room and even at Apollo's fight… even at your brother's fight, I saw the way he looked at you. I am not blind he wanted you and I wondered what you have been doing since you haven't really been here with your family since you damn well flew in to town for Apollo's fight!\" I stared at her for the longest moment and winced and nodded. \"Yeah. It's true. We hooked up before Apollo's fight. I didn't know who he was. So I thought why not. After I found out who he was, I cut him off, but he kept pursuing me and I gave in.\" I said now feeling like a horrible person. But I felt even worse keeping it from my sister in law. Mary Ann shook her head placing her hands over her face for a second. \"You should go, Alycia.\" she said calmly yet I knew she was holding back her anger. She was kicking me out. I didn't want to lose her. I couldn't. \"Mary Ann-\" \"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!\" she said pointing to the door her chest heaving through her dress and I just started crying as I gathered my coat and left out the house. The rest of the day was spent with me packing at my cabin. I couldn't believe Mary Ann had found out. And she was not wrong for her anger. She had only me left and I betrayed her. I sighed and just sat on my bed rubbing my forehead in stress. Would she tell Rocky? Would he hate me too? Would he even want me to come with him to Russia? I know I wouldn't because I would assume I would just be going to meet with the so-called enemy. Suddenly the doorbell went off and I looked up and wondered what Ivan was doing here. I got up and moved into the living room and up to the front door. I then gasped as I saw it was not Ivan, but Ludmilla. She was in her usual grey suit with the white blouse underneath. I just stared at her for a moment looking at her pointed nose looking down at me. \"This little game you and my husband are playing is over.\" she stated. I was silent for a moment and she raised her hand anyway to stop me from talking should I decide to. \"I turned a blind eye to your little sexcapades when this first started, but now we are going back to our country and you will not slander Ivan's good name, because you cannot hold your legs together. He is MY husband and I am HIS wife. I let go of my lover and now I am here to tell you he is letting go of you. We will continue our marriage before and after he beats Balboa. You both will come to Russia and you will BOTH leave Russia when this is all over. I would hate for any news to get out about you. The mourning sister of a great champion sleeping with the very man who killed her husband? The entire Creed name would be ruined because of you… Do I make myself clear?\" I stiffened at her words before nodding. \"Yes. Crystal.\" I replied and she nodded and turned around. \"But Ludmilla.\" I called to her and watched as she turned to me. I shook my head. \"Jealousy does not suit you.\" And I watched her glare before I closed my door and locked it. Once her car left my driveway I sighed heavily and prepared for the flight that was to take place. Rocky would need weeks to train and I would be there with him as much as I can.[Chapter 14] 14 The plane ride was quiet. Adrian's brother Paulie and Apollo's trainer, Duke was with us. Rocky didn't seem upset or even bring up anything about Ivan and I. I'm guessing Mary Ann didn't want to distract Rocky from his training. There were secrets enough in our family that did not need to come to the light anyways. What's one more secret to add? I had my chin resting on my knuckles as I stared out the window of the plane. Wow we were so high up. \"Hey.\" I looked up as Rocky sat down beside me. \"How are you feeling?\" I shook my head gently. \"Scared. Terrified.\" I replied and I felt his hand rest over mine. \"Hey. Nothing's going to happen. You're not going to be too far from me. The city is only a few miles away from my cabin. You'll have a translator with you.\" he said and I shook my head. \"No. I don't want to be in a city away from you. I want to be closer.\" I replied. He nodded. \"Okay, okay. I'll see what we can have done when we land.\" he said and I smiled some and I sighed leaning my head on his shoulder. I feel his cheek on my head and we just stayed like this. \"I can't believe all of this is happening… he's really gone.\" I whispered. \"I know.\" he replied gently and he rubbed his head gently against me. A part of me felt I should tell him everything that happened between Ivan and I. But I held back. If it's been on Mary Ann's mind all this time, I knew it would be on his mind and it would be his down fall in this upcoming fight. \"Look I know it'll probably be hard for you to see this all happen. You just being with me now is all I need after my fight with Adrian. If you want to watch from where you're staying then that's fine with me.\" he said lowly and I looked up at him. To see them both fighting in the ring together, lord I'd have a panic attack. \"I'll let you know.\" I replied softly. I felt we were on this plane forever, but finally we landed. I expected an actual airport, but instead I could see small buildings with signs in a different language. Once the plane came to a complete stop we all began to gather our things. Rocky had my coat in hand so he helped me put it on. I buttoned myself off and I could hear the door of the plane coming down. The plane was filled with cold air and snow flew right inside. Paulie moved out first. \"This place is horrendous.\" I heard him say. Duke left first then Rocky and I followed. All I saw was white: white skies, snow, soldiers. Rocky held his arm up for me and I wrapped my arm around him and we moved down the steps. My boots disappeared in the snow. Two black cars with Russian flags was parked a few feet from us. \"That must be our escort.\" Paulie said, and an older man stepped out. He approached us all. \"Mr. Balboa. I'm Nicholai. I will be escorting you and your company to your respective lodging.\" he said. How I understood him was a mystery to me, but we all nodded. \"How far will Alicia be from the cabin. We don't need to be too far apart.\" Rocky explained. Nicholai nodded slowly. \"She will be in a cabin just outside the city. Close to you. All is prepared for her stay.\" he explained before saying something in his language motioning for us to follow. Rocky and I looked at each other and I could see he was mildly uncomfortable with two cars potentially separating us. \"It's fine.\" I assured him, and he nodded and we began to put our bags in the trunk of the car. I moved over to the car in the back as was instructed and the back door was open to me. Two thick bearded men were in the front seat and I wouldn't lie, I was nervous, but this was all business. I had to trust I was in good hands. Rocky took my hand. \"I'll come and check on you when I'm settled.\" he said and I nodded. \"Okay.\" I replied. We each got into our vehicles and they began to move. This snow was so thick, but some roads were paved and we drove above them. I immediately looked out the window at the scenery. It was beyond beautiful. I looked at the two men who drove and they were quiet and kept their eyes on the road. Up ahead we were coming to a fork in the snow and the car up front took the right, and we took the left. I watched carefully of course as this was done. There didn't seem to be anything to worry about. Or at least that's what I told myself. Now there was nothing but white blankets of snow and I just looked down as I thought about the past and what will happen in the future. \" Then hate me until you love me again.\" God why me? I could feel my eyes watering from the pain. But the car was coming to a halt and I looked up to see we were at a log cabin covered in snow on its porch and ice on the edges of the porch. Behind the cabin was indeed an unknown Russian city. Secluded but not. The men got out and I moved to open the door but one of them opened it for me. They said something in their language, and I just stepped out. I only had two bags that they carried with ease into the cabin. I moved in first and looked around the warm space. It was actually really cozy inside. There was a living room with a TV and sofa and a reclining chair. A glass coffee table separated the chair and TV and a nice rug was beneath it. In the back was a kitchen. I moved over to it to see it was clean, the fridge stocked with eggs and meat and water and milk and other little things labeled in Russian. It was warm here and I liked that. There was another half of the house I would into once the men left. One of them set my bags down and the other faced me. \"All you need is here. Anything else, you tell Nicholai.\" he said gruffly and I nodded. \"Thank you.\" I said and the two men grunted and left. They reversed from the driveway and drove away. I inhaled softly, my arms crossed as I stared out the window at the back of the car as it disappeared in the distance. I heard a slight bang which made me tense and turn toward the hall in the back. My heart was pounding hard and I moved into the kitchen over toward the stove. There was a knife set on the back wall and I grabbed the biggest knife I could find. I didn't know what was going on, but I was planning to handle it. I moved back down the hall slowly. There were only two rooms. I kept my back close to the wall. The open door on the left gave me a slight view. I saw porcelain and saw it was the bathroom. I could only see half of the mirror and it had a reflection of the room across. It was the bedroom and I heard heavy footsteps coming toward the door. I was shaking, but I had to do something. I screamed out and turned inside, knife up, and ready to stab whatever was inside. But immediately, a cold hand catches my wrist and I scream more as my back hits the closest wall and I look up in shock at who it was. \"Ivan.\" I said breathlessly. His eyes were gazing down at me. \"Licia.\" he replied lowly, and I just looked him over. He's in full uniform. I shook my head, my hand slowly releasing the knife and it clanged to the ground. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked sharply, while his other hand took my free hand and placed it against his cheek. \"I usually come here to get away from city, wife, trainer… the world. Since Balboa at other cabin, I figured you'd be placed here to not be too far from him in Mother Russia.\" I stared at my hand as he moved it across his cheek and his lips. \"But why did you decide to come here?\" I asked slowly removing my hand from him. He looked down at me almost hurt. \"I couldn't stay away. This is far enough that cameras would not find us. No one would be here.\" he explained now raising his hands above me almost pinning me to the wall. I sighed and shook my head. \"Ivan… you shouldn't have come. Your wife…\" I said and he nodded almost looking annoyed at the thought of his wife. \"Yes. She told me she came to see you to cut things off.\" he explained and I nodded slowly. \"She's not wrong. Now we are in your world. You are held at a way higher expectation than me and being here, I'm sure you're expected to be other places but here.\" I explained and he nodded and slowly placed his hands on my cheeks. \"I don't fear my wife. I fear no one.\" he whispered his body leaning closer to me, his face leaning down to me. \"But she could expose us. It would be bad for you.\" I replied, and he shook his head. \"I don't care.\" he replied and finally his lips found mine, and I close my eyes feeling a single tear slide down my cheek. His arms wrapped around my shoulder and my arms embraced beneath his arms. I couldn't stop this. I couldn't stop loving him no matter how hard I tried. He pulled back inches from me. \"After that press conference we did in America... I knew I could not be without you.\" I smiled softly and leaned back in to him kissing him deeply. Author's Hey all so I am going to try and finish this soon. The end of this fanfic will end with the beginning of Creed 2 sort of showing how things are like between the two. Now this would mean either Alicia and Drago did not stay together or they did and a alot happened because of this. But I do have an idea of how I will end the story. Maybe Alicia adopts Adonis herself and remains in his corner for support until she sees Ivan after all these years aka in Creed 2 which yeah i am soooo excited about I already have ideas for the sequel and the trailers just made my ideas even better. Not spoiling the end of this fic. It could go either way. They may get their happy ending or they may not which only means the forbidden temptations will continue. Who knows that's the fun haha more uploads soon![Chapter 15] 15 Ivan immediately raised me from the ground, his hands taking my bottom in his palms and raising. I locked my arms and legs around him and he led me to the king-sized bed in the back of the room. Our lips pulled back and we smiled at each other as he carried me. \"I've missed your touch so much.\" he replied lowly as he lied me down on my back. I caressed his face as he climbed on top of me. \"This may be the only time we get to be together before you start training.\" I replied and he nodded and leaned up on his knees, my body between his legs, and he unbuttoned his jacket quickly. I leaned up so I could wiggle out of my clothes as well. At the sight of me, he began to move faster to remove his clothes. His bare chest faced me as he moved down to slide off my shoes and then my pants. Once he was left to his boxers, and me in my bra and panties, he just leaned over me and looked my face over. For a split second he looked concerned, confused maybe as well. \"How can you forgive a killer?\" he asked. I looked his face over in thought of question and I shook my head. \"I hated you, so I could love you again.\" I responded softly, and he closed his eyes for a split second before leaning down and crashing his lips with mine. I wrapped my arms around him, responding to his kiss. His hands moved over my shoulders, massaging me, causing me to shiver. My hands moved down his shoulders feeling every inch of his muscles. I wondered if I would ever feel his arms around me, holding me again after the fight. But I would not think about that right now. I would only think about having him in my arms tonight. His hands cupped my breasts through my bra, and I let out a soft moan as I feel his hands slide behind my body to unclasp the bra. Once I felt the tightness suddenly loosen, I leaned up so he could slide it off and toss it to the ground. My hands curled into his blonde locks and I feel his lips find mine, his tongue slipping past my lips to find mine. I press my body up into his now moving my hips into his. He responds with a soft growl and rolls us over so I am resting on top of him. I kissed up and down his jaw line going down to his neck and nipping at his sweet, flesh. His eyes closed and he let his head fall back as he let me have his way with him. My fingers ran down his chest and over his hard stomach. It seemed great minds think alike as we both reached for the others underwear. We looked at each other with a soft smile and now we moved out of the last bit of fabric. He curled his fingers into mine and I felt how warm they were even after being in the freezing cold. He pulled me back up to him and wrapped one arm around his back and turned us back over again. My head rested on the pillow and he seems to block out everything in my vision, he's so large. His legs move between my own, and I part for him. He fits perfectly between me and he leans down once more and kisses me, only this time, it's passionate and hot. I can feel the head of his cock pressing against my entrance and slowly he pushes again. We both exhale softly as I feel my walls stretch for the size of him then tighten around him. My head falls back and I feel his lips sucking and biting gently on the side of my flesh. Immediately, my legs locked around his bottom and I feel him pull out and firmly push back in. I gasp and look up at him with a heated gaze to see his eyes matched mine. He pulls back and whips back into me, causing a heightened moan to escape me. Already my stomach is tingling and tightening from his slow yet hard thrusts. He smiles down and takes my hand pressing it to his chest, directly over his heart. I can feel his heart pounding against my palm even as he increases speed. With this increase, I feel the tingling grow more intense which causes more moaning to escape me. My hips begin to grind against his and I feel the heat rising in the room. Ivan's eyes close as he's engulfed in the ecstasy we're both feeling. All of his moaning and panting excites me more and I feel my fingers reaching down toward my clit, but he beats me to it. He's rubbing me vigorously and my body arches to his touch. My toes are already curling and his speed picks up even more. \"OH GOD!\" I cry out in utter pleasure. I'm seeing stars and Ivan leans over me and kisses me hard. Our bodies move in perfect sync with one another, our pants rough and ragged. His hand finds mine on the bed and he curls them together once more. My orgasm hits me unexpectantly and I cry out shaking violently as I am engulfed in the tremors of his love. I feel his shaft pulsing inside me before he cums next. He growls hard and holds himself deep inside me. I pull him to me and he leans into me and wraps his arms around me as if not wanting to let go. He continues to hold me even after he pulls out and we are resting against each other. \"I don't want to leave this room. It's like a perfect dream and if I leave then I'll wake up and live in this imperfect world.\" Ivan said into my hair. I closed my eyes feeling a single tear slide down my cheek and I wipe it away. He must have seen my hand go to my face, because when I finally look up at him, he looks immediately concerned. \"Me too. I know I will probably have to go back to America once this fight is over. And when that happens why don't we… write to each other or something.\" I replied and he stares at me with soft and tired eyes. \"It would hurt me every day to write to you knowing I might not ever get to hold you again.\" he replied softly cupping my cheek and I nodded feeling I may start to really cry now. \"Well I wouldn't be able to call you. So just promise me that's what we'll do?\" I asked and he sighed and nodded. \"Da.\" he replied and we leaned in to each other and sealed our agreement with a kiss… Christmas Day I was surrounded by foreign faces clapping and cheering as Ivan moved down the aisle in all of his glory. Adrian, deciding to come and support Rocky, was sitting beside me. We seemed to be each other's peace while watching this fight. Ludmilla was sitting not too far from us shooting me a glare. I just ignored it and looked at the ring as Ivan walked down in his yellow and red robe. His gloves looked bigger than I remembered. There were soviet soldiers in the front on the other side of the stage saluting him. Rocky had already come to the ring and was booed rather quickly. I feel Adrian's shaky hand move into mine and I looked at her. \"It will be okay.\" I replied and she nodded glancing back at the stage. \"Just keep telling me that throughout this fight.\" she replied and I gave her hand a squeeze. \"I will.\" I replied and now I could see everyone standing up. One of the announcers came over to us. \"This is Russia's National Anthem. Please stand.\" he said, and we both stood. We did not know the words, but the lyrics sounded strong and proud. I noticed Rocky and Ivan were staring at each other through the entire anthem. Focus Rocky. Focus. I had not seen Ivan after he came to visit me, which I was happy for only because he needed to focus on his training. Rocky trained hard. I believed he was ready to fight. Once the singing was done, we sat back down and the cheering continued. Rocky and Ivan met in the center of the ring and I just stared at the two as the referee said something to them. Like I could hear anything. The crowd was so loud I was beginning to feel a little headed. But I did see the two boxers touch gloves and the trainers began to move from the boxers. The bell finally sounded and I knew it was time. Author's Notes Sorry if this chapter felt rushed or wasn't good. I am very sick and trying to close this fic the best that I can. Um since most of us know the Ivan vs. Rocky is all fighting I am not going to dedicate too much of the chapter to the fight alone because a surprise is going to happen that leads into the next Rocky/Creed fanfiction. Response to Iyona5: I most likely will write an alt. ending after the fic is over and title it as such so readers can see how it would have ended had the two been together. Also the sequel will be a OCXViktor fanfic with some ivan/alicia scenes.[Chapter 16] 16 There's supposed to be 15 rounds in this fight. Can Rocky go this long? What was I thinking, of course he can. Was it wrong to be rooting for both men to win, for there to be no loser? I knew what this would mean for Rocky if he lost. It would mean he failed Apollo. If Ivan lost, his entire country would turn its back on him. I found myself curling my fingers and bowing my head with my eyes closed praying that whatever happened, it was in God's hands now. The first round started and it seemed Rocky was testing the waters of the ring, slowly getting used to Ivan's moves. Ivan, I could tell wanted blood. I wasn't surprised by this. In the ring, you're a different person. There is only one rule and it's to win. Ivan got him on the ropes a few times throwing punches into Rocky's stomach. I was already tense watching this. Ivan threw a punch that sent Rocky to the ground. I winced and Adrian looked down covering her face with her hand. Rocky looked up at us and I nodded at him giving him my own confidence. Ivan raised his glove to his glove to some suited men in a small stage above the crowd. Rocky could do this I just know he can. Once Rocky got back on his feet, Ivan came at him with some body shots. Rocky was trying to dodge him but the corner had him pinned. Every time he tried to get out of it, Ivan knocked him right back into it. He was trapped. \"Come on, Rocky.\" I whispered. Once the bell sounded, Rocky attempted to get out of that corner, but Ivan through him right back in there. Rocky gave a hostile look. 'Come on what are you doing, Ivan?' I thought to myself. Ivan looked around the front of the ring for something. Maybe it was for me. Our eyes finally looked and I just looked at him with a nervous, but confident stare. He turned from me and sat down at his corner. I looked down, tucking some hair behind my ear and the two boxers moved at it again. Rocky circled the ring trying to avoid Ivan's punches but he got him right back in the corner. \"Come on Rocky!\" I shouted even though I knew my voice couldn't be heard. Ivan was throwing punches, hard and focused punches. Rocky was shielding himself before he started to swing wildly himself. Suddenly, in one punch, Ivan stumbles back. \"HE'S CUT!\" I hear someone yell. My mouth drops and I find myself standing up in awe not thinking it was truly possible. So, he's not a machine after all. Ivan touches his face slowly in shock as he looked at his glove for traces of blood. I can see it from my seat. The gash above his eye Rocky was coming after Ivan throwing strong punches. He was leading this dance this time. He waltzes with Ivan across the room and gets him into a corner where he had the advantage. My mouth dropped in total shock at the scene as Rocky was finally coming for blood of his own. My hands cover my mouth in shock. Everyone seems taken back as Rocky was starting to dominate. The bell rang and Rocky has to be removed by the referee only for Ivan to grab him by the throat in anger and lands a cheap shot right in his face. I winced at this move, but Rocky isn't having it. He picks Ivan up and this was the first time I see him man handled by another. He slams Ivan to the ground like a wrestler and now both are throwing punches of their own. Dukes and the other trainers rush to the ring to pull the two off each other. I lifted my dress and immediately ran down the steps toward Duke's side as the they finally separated the boxers. \"Now he's worried. You cut him, you hurt him. You see! You see he's not a machine! He's a man!\" Duke's preached and I leaned forward towards the two looking up at Rocky's bruised face. Even though I love Ivan, I have to be here for Rocky. \"He can be broken, Rocky!\" I yelled, and he looked down at me with a quick smile. Two soldiers were trying to remove me from the ring. \"Take it to him.\" Rocky nodded and began to get up again. I raised my hands and moved back from the ring and back over to our seats and sat beside Adrian. The fight immediately got heated. It felt like an all-out brawl. Ivan was throwing punches like each one should have ended Rocky, but he just kept coming. Round after round, Rocky would not be taken out. If he fell, he got right back up. Every punch to the face, he came right back swinging. Now both fighters were drenched in sweat and the crowd's cheering grew wilder. I could have sworn I heard some of the Russian's cheering for Rocky. I glanced at Ludmilla to see she looked irritated and upset. She looked my way and I met her glare full on. We both looked back at the ring and continued to watch the fight unfold between us. My face was moving from left to right to left to right. The air was tense with anticipation of who was going to go down first. I couldn't remain in my seat any longer. I was on my feet watching with a tightened stomach every time Ivan hit Rocky. And you'd think there would be relief when Rocky hit Ivan, but there was not. Each punch thrown was an anxiety attack after another for me watching two men I cared for fight it out. Blood, bruises, cuts that's all I was seeing right now. Ivan knocked Rocky to the ground and slowly Rocky rose. He would not stop coming. I could see the exhaustion on Ivan's face as Rocky continued to get right back up. I noticed an older man in a suit came over to our seats. \"Ms. Creed, you have a telephone call for you in the halls from America!\" he shouted. I was confused by this. Adrian looked at me in curiosity. \"A phone call? Who?\" I asked. \"From a Dr. Lamont Rose of Melroad Hospital.\" he replied. Now I was immediately worried. \"That's back home.\" I said and quickly got up and followed the small man outside and down the hall. I was led to a small box office where they had given out tickets. I took the phone. \"Hello?\" I asked. \"Is this Alicia Creed?\" the male voice asked. \"Yes this is she.\" I replied. \"Ms. Creed, my name is Lamont Rose, I am one of the MD's at Melroad hospital. I am calling because you are the emergency contact after Apollo Creed for a Mary Ann Creed.\" he explained. immediately I felt uneasy. Adrian appeared in the doorway of the way office and I waved her over so she could share the phone with me. \"Yes, she's my sister-in-law. What happened?\" I asked. \"Ms. Creed, Mrs. Creed was involved in an auto accident that happened earlier today in the city. It was a four-car pileup. It seemed the cars lost control on the ice, and your sister was one of the cars involved.\" he explained. My body was shaking and my eyes were watering. \"Is she okay?\" I asked. \"She's in surgery right now and we won't know anything until she is out. But Ms. Creed… she's lost a lot of blood.\" he explained. \"I've been informed that you are currently in Russia-\" \"And I am on my way back into the states right now.\" I replied. \"Yes ma'am.\" he replied. I hung up the phone feeling immediate dread in my body. \"Oh no no no!\" I chanted tears flowing down my face. Adran grabbed me quickly. \"Hey hey. It's okay. Our cars are waiting out for us. You have your ticket?\" she asked and I nodded rummaging through my small purse for it. \"Go. I will stay here and tell Rock what happened after the fight is over. Then I will go to your cabin and get your stuff.\" I only nodded and hurried from the box office. I was so happy to not be in heals. I hurried down the halls, my mind racing. I managed to find the two men who drove me from the airport. In a panic was I trying to tell them to get me back to the airport so I could head home. They looked unsure, but did as I asked. I got inside the back of the car and they drove off. My mind was spinning and I ran my hands through my hair unable to truly comprehend the news I had just received. She was going to make it. She had to. This was my fault. I did this. I tore our family apart with my lustful needs and my feelings. Now this is my punishment. We arrived at the airport and a plane was there making noises that I could only assume it was ready to go. I got on the plane and just like that it took off into the air. I had never flown all by myself in such a state of panic, but it couldn't be helped.[Chapter 17] 17 The hours seemed to never go by fast enough. All I could think about was Mary Ann and how this was all my fault. When the plane finally landed at the airport, I hurried to the parking garage, got in my car and took off for the hospital. However, the roads were horrible, so I had to take my time. This made things seem even worse now, the wait. Once the hospital was in sight, I gave a sigh of relief and parked my car. I hurried inside and up the counter. \"Hello, my name is Alicia Creed. My sister was checked in. Mary Ann Creed.\" I replied quickly. \"Ms. Creed?\" an olive skinned, thin haired doctor replied. I turned to him and nodded. \"Lamont Rose?\" I asked and he nodded. \"Right this way.\" he replied and I immediately followed him down the hall. \"Is she out of surgery?\" I asked. He nodded, yet his face remained sympathetic. \"She is, but we have done all we can. She has broken two of her ribs and punctured a lung. She has multiple skull fractures. Her chances of survival aren't looking good.\" he said and I slowed my walking, letting my hand fall over my stomach. \"What you're saying she could die today?\" I asked and he just looked at me with soft eyes. \"I won't say yes, but I will not say no.\" he replied and raised his hand to a room. \"She's in here.\" he replied. Room 103. I felt tears streaming down my face and I moved over to it slowly. I realized the press is going to soon find out she is here. I looked at the doctor. \"No press, no reporters are to come into this room.\" I commanded and he nodded. \"Of course.\" he replied and I nodded and looked back at the door. It felt like a tremendous weight was put on my shoulders and I closed my eyes and slowly opened the door and entered. I was met with gentle beeping and finally the bed with her in it. I almost couldn't walk inside, but when I saw her bruised face, I moved in quickly and finally saw all of her. She was breathing all raspy and softly and I covered my hand with my mouth. Oh this wasn't happening. This was a nightmare. I just looked her up and down and I just shook my head. Her face was so pale, the beautiful ebony hues had faded from her skin. Slowly her eyes began to open. They looked so heavy. \"A… Alicia.\" she whispered and I leaned in to her. \"I'm here, Mary Ann. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. I was so stupid.\" I cried and she shook her head slowly. \"No.\" she breathed out. \"Do not ever think this is your fault… we are not in control of the life around us. I'm just glad you're here.\" Her hand weakly reached for mine and I gave it to her immediately. \"Mary Ann… I-\" \"It's okay… we can't help… who we fall in love with.\" she said, and I just closed my eyes feeling hot tears stream down my face. \"Tell me what to do…\" I replied and she slowly shook her head groaning some. \"It's in God's hands now. But I have to tell you what will happen if I don't make it.\" she said softly and I shook my head. \"Good thing you are going to make it.\" I responded with a half-smile and she rasped some. I could feel her hand trying to squeeze mine. \"Apollo and I have already discussed what should happen if we both die before our times. It's in our wills… you will get everything from our life insurance policies. All of our belongings and housing is yours.\" She said and I shook my head leaning down closer to her. \"I don't want it. I just want you here and Apollo.\" I said sniffling and she shook her head. \"You must be strong now, Alicia.\" she said trying to sound firm. I wiped my nose and nodded. \"Okay. Okay.\" I said. My heart was pounding hard in my chest. She blinked very slowly and gave a soft exhaled. \"Everything is going to go to you. We have no debts you won't have to worry about that. But… there is something else you should know.\" she said. I nodded placing both my hands in hers. \"What is it?\" I asked softly and she was breathing a bit hard now, but soon it faded and she was taking even breaths. \"You remember the time I moved in with you?\" she asked. I could never forget. Apollo had had an affair with another woman and Mary Ann had no one else to turn to except me. I nodded. \"Yes.\" I replied and she nodded. \"Apollo had two kids with this woman… twins. A little boy… and a little girl.\" she said and my eyes widened now as I listened. She nodded slowly. \"There is documentation of who they and their mother are. In case we ever wanted to meet them. It's with our lawyers who have the paper work for our wills. You are next to get that information should I pass.\" Twins. My brother has children somewhere out there. \"The information will tell you how to get in contact with them. Their mother has all three of us as her emergency contacts… if something happened to Apollo and me you would be notified. I'm sorry we didn't tell you. But if you are ever curious of who they are, you have the power to find them.\" she explained. I looked at her heart monitor to see everything was beeping steadily. I inhaled some and slowly nodded. \"Okay. Okay, I understand.\" I replied and she nodded. \"Thank you. You were in Russia with Rocky?\" she asked and I nodded. \"Yes. But it's long over now.\" I replied and she nodded. \"Who do you think won?\" she asked. I inhaled some and sniffled shaking my head. \"I don't know.\" I answered truthfully. She nodded and slowly looked to the TV. \"Cut it on?\" she asked softly. I nodded taking the remote off the small table and cutting it on. It was on the news already streaming a news cast of the fight. It was over and Rocky had won. He was surrounded in the ring by numerous people and holding up the American flag. My eyes widened at the sight. \"He won… Mary Ann he won!\" I said happily covering my mouth. I was so very happy, happy that in some way my brother was avenged and we could move on with our lives. And with that happiness came sadness, because I knew I could not go back to Russia to be with Ivan. I didn't even get to say good bye. Suddenly, the chilling flat line of the heart monitor made me freeze and slowly look back at her. Her eyes were closed and her body no longer moved. Her chest made no attempt to inflate outward. I shook my head quickly, yelping out as I realized she was gone. \"No! Mary Ann, no please don't leave me!\" I cried hard crossing my arms on the bed and burying my face into it. 20 weeks later I waited in the office of Ken Schmidt with Rocky sitting beside me. The ultra sound was in my hand and I was just looking at his small head. \"Well at least you know he's got your forehead.\" Rocky teased and I gave a gentle smile. \"Yes. Now I cannot disown him.\" I replied. I have not received a single letter from Ivan. Even though we exchanged addresses and I wrote to him, I never got anything back. I was unsure if he got my letters or if this was finally his way of letting me know things were over between us. I wanted to be upset with him, but after hearing from some of my connections that he was taking major heat from his superiors over the loss, I knew I had to let him go to deal with his situation and should we ever find each other again, then I would tell him. Rocky knew. I told him and it took him a few weeks to forgive me. Hey there are worst secrets out there. You're my family and I'm not going to lose you, too. \"Alright, Ms. Alicia. Everything has been prepared and once you sign this document, all of Apollo and Mary Ann's assets and funds are yours.\" he replied. Rocky stood up now. \"I will wait outside.\" he said. I nodded and watched him leave now. I just stared at him for a moment and nodded. The slender lawyer also pulled out a manila folder. \"These are the documents of the twin children. DNA testing has proven that they are in fact Apollo's children.\" he replied. I nodded and took the folder first. I stared at it for a moment. \"Is something the matter?\" \"I am curious.\" I replied gently. \"Of what?\" he asked and I just shrugged some. \"Their names.\" I replied and finally opened the folder looking over the paper work of their birth and who their mother was. Johnson. I finally moved down to the bottom of the page and found myself smiling at the two names listed below… END Author's notes And this is the end of Forbidden Temptation. As you can see Ivan and Alicia did not get their happy ending but something else came out of their relationship that will be talked about in the next fanfic. I will write an alt ending but it'll come later on. Anyways thanks for sticking with me![Chapter 18] Alternate Ending I glanced at Ludmilla to see she looked irritated and upset. She looked my way and I met her glare full on. We both looked back at the ring and continued to watch the fight unfold between us. My face was moving from left to right to left to right. The air was tense with anticipation of who was going to go down first. I couldn't remain in my seat any longer. I was on my feet watching with a tightened stomach every time Ivan hit Rocky. And you'd think there would be relief when Rocky hit Ivan, but there was not. Each punch thrown was an anxiety attack after another for me watching two men I cared for fight it out. Blood, bruises, cuts that's all I was seeing right now. Ivan knocked Rocky to the ground and slowly Rocky rose. He would not stop coming. I could see the exhaustion on Ivan's face as Rocky continued to get right back up. Adrain put her head into her hand in sadness. Ivan's fist shot out like a snake, hitting Rocky, in the jaw a stream of blood spewing from his mouth. I could see Tony shaking his head a long noooo spewing from him. But Rocky was not down. If he was knocked down he got up. Eventually, Ivan was going to tire from Rocky's infinite will power. \"Come on!\" Rocky shouts to Ivan from across the ring. \"Da!\" Ivan shouts in reply. My face moved from left to right to left to right again continuing to watch their fists moving to face, to ribs, to stomach. Round 11 and they were still going like well-oiled machines. No matter how many shots they threw, the other would not give up. By round 12 everyone was cheering for Rocky. I looked around in surprise as his strength had won the hostile crowd over. When you have something worth fighting for, nothing could stop you. You can't beat a piece of iron. Finally the 15th round was here. It all came down to this. I could see Ivan's manager running up the ring. He looked upset, probably because Ivan was not winning in his eyes. He said something in Ivan's face before mushing the side of his cheek with his hand. Now Ivan stood up quickly grabbing the older man by the throat. My eyes widened as he stood tall and threw him in the crowd. Before I knew it, he was facing me but screaming up at the older men in the office. He finally looked down at me with heavy pants and I gave a weak smile kissing the tips of my fingers and turning my palm to him to show him that I still had confidence in him. He looked tired and heavily ready to be done with this fight. He turned and began to face Rocky. I didn't care if Adrian caught my gesture. I didn't care that Ludmilla saw Ivan staring at me. I just wanted him to know I still cared. But finally this round would be the only round. Rocky and Ivan came together in the ring and hit gloves before going at it again. As they did this, I began to feel a panic come over me. I was seeing my brother in that ring again falling to the ground never to get back up. I was panting heavily and I quickly moved down the aisle and into the hall. It wasn't exactly quiet, but it would work just fine. I placed my back to the wall and did my best to slow my breathing. A part of me wishes I wasn't here, that I was home in Colorado. But even being there, it wouldn't have made a difference. Apollo still would have fought Ivan and died. What was to happen after this fight? Truly to happen? The sound of counting began to play over my head and I looked realizing it wasn't me counting, but the crowd itself. Someone had gone down? My head snapped up and I looked around. I hurried back into the arena and just stood there, stunned at who was on the ground. Ivan. He was on his back trying to climb the ropes to get up. \"5…6…7.\" Everyone was counting. I covered my mouth with my hand in shock to see him down. Before Ivan could even get up, he rolled right out of the ring and the ref called it. My eyes widened as Rocky did a quick spin and everyone shouted with glee. I just stood there covering my mouth with both my hands as reporters and friends rushed the stage to Rocky. They lifted him in the air like a champion. The crowd is chanting his name and I feel hot tears stream down my face. \"Yes. Yes.\" I cried in happiness clapping. He had won, Apollo. He had won. The crowd was too crazy and so I didn't move from my spot at the aisle. As Rocky gave a beautiful speech about the change between our countries, I noticed Ivan stand up from his stool. Reporters had mics in his face, and he ignored them all as he looked around the crowd that stuck to Rocky. I knew he was looking for me. I inhaled nervously as I wondered if he would find me. He looked around himself and outside the ring. He placed his gloves on the ropes and looked down at the sea of people and I just watched, surprised he was doing so in front of everyone. He lifted his head up finally and his eyes finally found me. I felt stuck to the ground as he saw me, face bloody and bruised. What was he thinking. Ludmilla was calling to him, but he didn't even show acknowledgement to her. He began to remove his gloves. I smiled knowing what he was going to do and started to kick off my heals. The crowd followed his eyes to me, and he tore off his gloves with his teeth as he began to move beneath the ropes. As he removed the bandages from his hands and move up the aisle, I dashed for him. There was no one between us and if they tried we would knock them down. He gave a light jog up to me and I jumped into his arms. He caught me immediately, crashing his bloody lips into mine and I held his shoulders against mine. There was a sea of gasps around us, but they vanished from my mind immediately as I focused on the taste of blood from his lips. We pulled back and gazed at each other. My hands caressed his sweaty cheeks. I was just glad he was standing here before me. Flashes of cameras were around us with people asking us thousands of questions. \"You did it.\" I said softly and he took my face in his hands. \"I do for you.\" he said, beads of sweat trailing down his face. I smiled and leaned into him kissing him passionately again. 20 weeks later \"Are you sure you want to fly up, Rock. I know it feels like I betrayed you and the entire family.\" I replied gently pacing the room with the phone in my hand. \"Well it definitely was a surprise, but you know you're my sister and I love you. If Mary Ann can forgive you then so can I. I know Apollo would have.\" he said. In my hand was the ultra sound showing the round head of the baby boy I was going to have. \"You know I love you Rock.\" I replied. \"And I love you too, Alicia. We'll be flying soon for that baby shower.\" he said and I nodded and smiled. \"Okay. See you soon.\" I replied and hung up the phone. I suddenly yelped as I was raised in the air and spun around. I was in a red sweater with black pants. \"Ivan put me down!\" I said staring down at his face. \"How can I when my fiancé is going to have my baby boy!\" he gushed. He carried me into the room of our brick home and lied me down on the bed. After the loss to Rocky, it seemed our publicized romance was the icing on the cake of his country turning against him. It was an outrage and no speech Rocky could give saved that. Ivan lost his titles along with Ludmilla and his sponsors. His family no longer spoke to him and the military no longer wanted him. I packed up and moved to Russia to stay with him after finding out I was pregnant with his son which not many people liked. But that was all of the bashing. I confessed everything to Rocky and he ignored me for a few weeks. But we talked it all out and got our feelings on the table. Mary Ann supported from afar. Ivan and I agreed if things got too heated in Russia then we would leave to America. But with our combined inheritance already, we were pretty set financially. As I curled up to him, holding the ultrasound in my hand, I finally looked at him. \"Are you sure you'll be okay? I know being a fighter and having the luxury life meant quite a lot to you.\" I replied softly. He nodded slowly, his eyes on the small picture as well. \"It did. But now I have something even better to enjoy.\" he said slowly taking the picture from me. \"I never once thought of kids with Ludmilla. If we had one, it would be out of business not love or the want of a family. Nothing in my past life was real. But you… you brought me peace and I knew how ever children you had, they would be mine.\" I smiled slowly at him and leaned my head on his shoulder looking at the picture as he held it up. \"I love you.\" I replied and he hummed lowly. \"I love you.\" he replied. I looked at the round head of the child. \"What should we name him?\" I asked and Ivan tilted his head some in thought. \"Alexander Apollo Drago.\" he replied looking up at me with curious eyes wondering if I would agree. I was outwardly stunned by the name suggestion, but it only brought me pure joy that he recommended it. I nodded. \"Perfect.\" I said and leaned down kissing him lovingly. This may not have been the life I had pictured for myself, but it was perfect for me, perfect for him. Perfect for us. The End","LastChapter":"Alternate Ending I glanced at Ludmilla to see she looked irritated and upset. She looked my way and I met her glare full on.

Before Ivan could even get up, he rolled right out of the ring and the ref called it. My eyes widened as Rocky did a quick spin and everyone shouted with glee. I just stood there covering my mouth with both my hands as reporters and friends rushed the stage to Rocky. They lifted him in the air like a champion. The crowd is chanting his name and I feel hot tears stream down my face. \"Yes. Yes.\" I cried in happiness clapping. He had won, Apollo. He had won. The crowd was too crazy and so I didn't move from my spot at the aisle. As Rocky gave a beautiful speech about the change between our countries, I noticed Ivan stand up from his stool. Reporters had mics in his face, and he ignored them all as he looked around the crowd that stuck to Rocky. I knew he was looking for me. I inhaled nervously as I wondered if he would find me. He looked around himself and outside the ring. He placed his gloves on the ropes and looked down at the sea of people and I just watched, surprised he was doing so in front of everyone. He lifted his head up finally and his eyes finally found me. I felt stuck to the ground as he saw me, face bloody and bruised. What was he thinking. Ludmilla was calling to him, but he didn't even show acknowledgement to her. He began to remove his gloves. I smiled knowing what he was going to do and started to kick off my heals. The crowd followed his eyes to me, and he tore off his gloves with his teeth as he began to move beneath the ropes. As he removed the bandages from his hands and move up the aisle, I dashed for him. There was no one between us and if they tried we would knock them down. He gave a light jog up to me and I jumped into his arms. He caught me immediately, crashing his bloody lips into mine and I held his shoulders against mine. There was a sea of gasps around us, but they vanished from my mind immediately as I focused on the taste of blood from his lips. We pulled back and gazed at each other. My hands caressed his sweaty cheeks. I was just glad he was standing here before me. Flashes of cameras were around us with people asking us thousands of questions. \"You did it.\" I said softly and he took my face in his hands. \"I do for you.\" he said, beads of sweat trailing down his face. I smiled and leaned into him kissing him passionately again. 20 weeks later \"Are you sure you want to fly up, Rock. I know it feels like I betrayed you and the entire family.\" I replied gently pacing the room with the phone in my hand. \"Well it definitely was a surprise, but you know you're my sister and I love you. If Mary Ann can forgive you then so can I. I know Apollo would have.\" he said. In my hand was the ultra sound showing the round head of the baby boy I was going to have. \"You know I love you Rock.\" I replied. \"And I love you too, Alicia. We'll be flying soon for that baby shower.\" he said and I nodded and smiled. \"Okay. See you soon.\" I replied and hung up the phone. I suddenly yelped as I was raised in the air and spun around. I was in a red sweater with black pants. \"Ivan put me down!\" I said staring down at his face. \"How can I when my fiancé is going to have my baby boy!\" he gushed. He carried me into the room of our brick home and lied me down on the bed. After the loss to Rocky, it seemed our publicized romance was the icing on the cake of his country turning against him. It was an outrage and no speech Rocky could give saved that. Ivan lost his titles along with Ludmilla and his sponsors. His family no longer spoke to him and the military no longer wanted him. I packed up and moved to Russia to stay with him after finding out I was pregnant with his son which not many people liked. But that was all of the bashing. I confessed everything to Rocky and he ignored me for a few weeks. But we talked it all out and got our feelings on the table. Mary Ann supported from afar. Ivan and I agreed if things got too heated in Russia then we would leave to America. But with our combined inheritance already, we were pretty set financially. As I curled up to him, holding the ultrasound in my hand, I finally looked at him. \"Are you sure you'll be okay? I know being a fighter and having the luxury life meant quite a lot to you.\" I replied softly. He nodded slowly, his eyes on the small picture as well. \"It did. But now I have something even better to enjoy.\" he said slowly taking the picture from me. \"I never once thought of kids with Ludmilla. If we had one, it would be out of business not love or the want of a family. Nothing in my past life was real. But you… you brought me peace and I knew how ever children you had, they would be mine.\" I smiled slowly at him and leaned my head on his shoulder looking at the picture as he held it up. \"I love you.\" I replied and he hummed lowly. \"I love you.\" he replied. I looked at the round head of the child. \"What should we name him?\" I asked and Ivan tilted his head some in thought. \"Alexander Apollo Drago.\" he replied looking up at me with curious eyes wondering if I would agree. I was outwardly stunned by the name suggestion, but it only brought me pure joy that he recommended it. I nodded. \"Perfect.\" I said and leaned down kissing him lovingly. This may not have been the life I had pictured for myself, but it was perfect for me, perfect for him. Perfect for us. The End","Summary":" 1 My brother always said I had a habit of choosing bad men.

ROCKY 5.5 FLASHBACK People outside of Andy's bar as well as a few more coming in from their houses or from across the street formed a large circle surrounding two brawlers fighting to the death. \"Come on dad, you can take him!\" said a small boy. The man got hit by a massive punch from the younger man who was bigger than he was. Both of them kept hitting each other. Until the more experienced man in the gray sweater turned it all around. He grabbed onto the young man's blue sport short and hit his ribs nonstop. There was another punch aimed to his face but he ducked and went to spar with him until his punches turned deadlier now. \"Go for it!\" the small boy nearby yelled while the rest of the people cheered the boy's father on. \"ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!\" Rocky sent a punch that could have made a dent to a cement wall to the younger man, Tommy Gunn, his protégé who was like another son to him until he turned to greed and not to a man with passion and heart like he did. He sent a second punch that could have shattered a window. 'I'm sorry I had to do this but I can't let you threaten my friends and family no more, Tommy. Why didn't I teach you well like Mick did for me, you know?\" he asked himself. Another punch to Tommy's face had him gasping and groaning in fatigue. He felt like he got hit by a train. \"He can't do this to me, I'm the champion! This ain't supposed to happen!\" he thought to himself and prepared for the final blow. \"This will at least teach Duke that my answer is still…\" Rocky sent an upper cut that lifted Tommy off his feet and onto the grill of a bus. The whole crowd celebrated his victory with the usual chanting of his name. He was embraced by his family but not before he shot a look at the real monster. A middle aged African American man wearing an expensive fur coat and golden glasses, he was the one who took Tommy away from him and turned him into a carbon copy of Rocky but it wasn't him. \"NO!\" he answered only in his mind. George Washington Duke as he was called initially wanted Rocky to come back in the ring. When Rocky refused and insisted he was retired, Duke tried everything to get him to box again so that he could make more money. Seeing Tommy Gunn trained by Rocky, he thought to himself if he had the skills as Balboa, 'He could make me an elephant --load of money.' Duke convinced Tommy to join him and offer him money and other luxuries that Rocky could never give him. As Rocky was being led away by his friends and family, he took a glimpse of Tommy being taken away by two police officers. Apparently he did cause the whole problem. Tommy beat up four bystanders who simply wanted to defend him. As Tommy Gunn was walking towards the police vehicle, he heard George Washington Duke's voice calling out to Rocky. \"Hey Rock! You outclassed the bum huh?\" he chuckled. Tommy was shocked to hear being called that and felt even more despair than ever. He then saw Rocky coming over to Duke menacingly and immediately saw him go nervous even if he put on a brave face. \"Touch me and I'll sue.\" He said. \"Come on pug, touch me and I'll sue.\" He taunted. Duke knew Rocky was not as intelligent as the average person, he assumed Rocky didn't know what the legal codes for being in court. He chuckled as he saw the crowd of people giving him the same stares that were making him even more scared but hid his emotions and tried to pretend nothing was going to happen. He thought wrong. Rocky gave him an uppercut that sent him to the top of a car. \"Sue me for what?\" Rocky said with a smile. Immediately Rocky Balboa joined his family and friends. While Tommy saw the whole thing behind the police car window driving away from the scene. FOUR HOURS LATER… Tommy Gunn was sitting in a jail cell isolated. He felt nothing but anger and sadness. \"Why did this happen? I was never beaten before even before I had that match against Cane.\" Suddenly the jail door opened, and in revealed a dark figure with a female companion he knew immediately. Tommy mostly paid attention to the man in the fur coat. \"Yo come on boy, it ain't over yet we got work to do so let's get your ass out here.\" As Tommy got out, he saw a large bruise on his face. It was indeed better than what he gotten. As he walked alongside Duke in the parking lot, Tommy immediately grabbed onto Duke's collar with both hands and roughly brought him to a pillar staring at him. \"You called me a bum!\" \"Come on listen listen I didn't mean…\" he said nervously. \"So it was true what Balboa said…YOU USED ME!\" Tommy yelled. \"I gave you money and luxuries remember? So don't back off now. Besides I have a contract on you and you still hold the heavyweight championship so don't back out now! We can still take Balboa.\" He said quickly. \"I'm the only friend you got!\" He yelled. Tommy loosened his grip and Duke chuckled nervously. \"Now let's get out of here. I got a plan.\" Rocky had a bunch of ice cubes stacked in his hand and pressed them to the left side of his head, he had withstood a massive amount of pain from that kid Tommy, but he came out the victor barely. In the basement, Rocky was tending to his bruises with Paulie getting him more ice. \"At least you still proved you still got what it takes Rocko\" he said a bit wearily. He had also been punched by Tommy and rubbed his jaw. \"That punk got what he deserved, he wasn't no real champ like you.\" Rocky sighed and felt a bit depressed. He was trained by the best and whatever knowledge was given to him would now be given to another alternative: his son. But he knew Robert didn't have the desire to be a boxer and wanted to let him follow his own dreams. So what was left then? \"Hey dad.\" Robert came down and went to his father's side. Rocky smiled. \"Hey kid, how you doin?\" \"I should be asking you that, you know ?\" he said chuckling. Rocky laughed as well. \"Yeah well, I had better times myself and uh I'm sorry you had to see all that and everything, you know?\" \"I told you before you were the real champ around here.\" He smiled. Adrian came down with a box of bandages ready. \"I thought that you should put these on for now.\" She said meekly. \"Yo thanks Adrian.\" He took her hand and kissed it. \"I'm sorry you know?\" \"It's all right I'm just glad it's over.\" She embraced him. \"Nah Adrian I don't think it's over.\" Rocky said looking ahead.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2. The penthouse was a luxurious and beautiful looking place. It was a nice environment filled with small statues and valuable portraits. The symbols of a wealthy man were emitting from each object. Four people in the house were currently discussing their number one issue: Balboa. \"I'ma come straight to the point! My plan is to make the people and above all else... Rocky Balboa pay for humiliating me!\" declared George Washington Duke. \"Whoa! Whoa!\" It was Tommy Gunn's turn, he waved his hands signaling him to stop talking. \"What about me?! I'm the one who got embarrassed in front of national television!\" The two men were each discussing their own problems at different levels. \"The point is we both got humiliated.\" said Duke to Tommy. \"Now…to make this quick and to the point my plan is to get rid of Balboa's community.\" He said and was now drifting off amazed at his new plan. Another man spoke up who barely said anything for a while. \"Wait a minute…are you saying you want to take over Rocky Balboa's neighborhood?\" it was Merlin Sheets, Duke's right hand man. Dressed in a tuxedo like suit, he looked drained as both of the men were debating. Duke looked almost maniacal. What would be the point in taking revenge upon innocent people? Duke was almost talking about people losing their homes because of him. These questions were raised in Merlin's head instantly. Happy that someone finally caught on fast, Duke slammed his fist on the table in emphasis. \"That's exactly what I'm saying!\" and pointing at him with his index finger. \"Duke you can't do this! Give the man some credit. He turned you down so what? Let's come up with a new…\" But Merlin was cut off by Duke. \"No no no no!…I want to teach that fool Balboa who he's messing with.\" He almost growled. Tommy ahead nodded his approval. \"This is going to make you look unethical George!\" \"This is an ultimatum! No better yet this is a war! Now Balboa may have won wars in the ring, but I can guarantee you he can't win my kind of war.\" Merlin looked apprehensive. \"This is definitely going to make you the bad guy George!\" he almost whispered. Duke looked almost insane. 'Who knows what the consequences will be?' He thought. \"The media is going to chew you up over this! What is the whole purpose on taking your anger out on him and a few bystanders?\" \"I don't take no for an answer.\" He simply told him and turned to Tommy. \"In the meantime, Tommy you have that fight against Trevor Berbick, so win that. That's our first priority.\" Tommy nodded eagerly and went out the door with his girlfriend, Karen, presumably to go train. Duke then turned to Sheets and said quietly. \"I'm doing this so that I can still get Balboa.\" he said with a devilish grin. \"He refuses, then him and his whole neighborhood goes!\" He then stormed out leaving a stunned Merlin Sheets behind. Rocky went to Mickey's Gym which he currently owned and kept operating in honor of his first trainer. He along with his friend Paulie trained eager young fighters. They had such potential as Rocky thought. \"Yo! You guys is doing great.\" Rocky kept giving everyone encouragement. Rocky walked around looking at the young people hitting punching bags with such purpose. These kids gave Rocky a smile at his pep talks. Paulie on the other hand was by the door in his usual wife-beater shirt selling what Rocky referred to as 'souvenirs.' \"I call it making more profit.\" Paulie had said to him. Paulie sold cups, plates, punching gloves that were used by Rocky even napkins. \"I'm tellin' ya you get this cup, you get his underwear half price.\" He said to a customer. \"Just the cup man.\" said a young fighter with a frown. As he went away, Paulie muttered. \"I wear them too, nothing wrong with them.\" Rocky went to him. \"So I guess your business is goin up?\" Paulie shrugged. \"I'm thinking I need a better angle or better advertisements, I don't know no more.\" Rocky gave him a pat on the back. \"Eh just keep doing what you do.\" He then went back to training a young fighter up ahead in one of the practice rings. Rocky and Paulie left the gym everyday after 8:30. Thanking the fighters for their hard work, they thanked him as well. They went off leaving Rocky alone with Paulie. Paulie was outside smoking his usual Cuban cigar waiting for him. Both of them walked back home together. \"I'm telling ya you're gonna get famous again for doing what you did weeks ago Rocko.\" Paulie was beginning a discussion about what had happened between him and Tommy Gunn. The news crew was there and obviously it had been on television. 'No wonder I've been getting more hellos.' thought Rocky. \"Eh I don't know Paulie. The whole money wasn't for me now that I think about it.\" Rocky rambled on. \"I don't know I mean every time I think about getting back I keep thinking about Tommy and how I let him down. I didn't show him the bad side of things Paulie.\" His protegé Tommy Gunn joined forces with George Washington Duke, a big time boxing promoter, who first tried to convince Rocky to join him. But it was revealed that he only wanted money. Tommy was oblivious to this when he joined Duke and offered him everything: a house, a car, and a girlfriend but not respect. \"Just forget about it. Maybe you could do better. I'm telling you something good will come from that.\" Paulie said. \"Hey Andy's Bar what do you say?\" after putting out his cigar and about to start a next one. \"Sure Paulie.\" As they made their way to Andy's, Rocky stopped after watching a glimpse of a girl struggling with two hoodlums. \"What is it Rock?\" Paulie asked and took a look at what has happening in an alley. \"Yo Paulie call the cops now!\" Rocky then ran over to the scene. Paulie protested \"Wa-wait ah sheez!\" and went off to find a pay phone. Rocky ran to the scene but stopped after the girl was standing and the two men who tried to assault her were on the ground in pain. He then looked at her. From the light coming from the left, she was a brunette and looked European; she was slim and very beautiful for a young girl. She looked at Rocky with precaution. \"Yo you ok?\" he asked. \"My friend back there is about to call the police so you should be ok.\" \"I can take care of myself thank you.\" She said roughly and grabbed her purse lying beside a trash can. \"Oh well that's good then. Those were some moves. You looked like you did real good you know?\" Rocky said. The young woman turned around. \"Are you Rocky Balboa?\" she asked frowning, finally getting a good look at him. \"Umm...Yeah.\" he grinned almost idiotically like a little kid. She smiled warmly at the newcomer.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 \"I'm Jackie.\" The young woman introduced herself. She was still breathing heavily from the fight. Apparently she took a couple of thugs down single-handedly. Rocky felt relieved that a woman like this one in particular can fight back. He continued to play the Good Samaritan card and asked her \"So you sure you okay? You don't like… need someone to walk you home or anything like that?\" Rocky asked. As he asked, several police sirens echoed off in the distance. Quickly, she put her purse around her shoulder. \"Thanks but that's okay. I better get going. \" She said a bit sheepishly and went off in a rapid pace. Rocky looked at her in a confused expression for a long time and jogged off in the opposite direction. He needed to tell Paulie that everything was okay after all. 'It's going to be a waste of fifty cents for Paulie but what the hey?' He thought. Rocky caught up with Paulie next to a police officer he was talking to. By then the hoodlums were already being apprehended. \"Yo everything's okay it was just a false alarm. This girl....\" Rocky struggled to finish his sentence. \"she handled it and everything.\" and pointed at the officer wearily. \"Are you drunk Mr. Balboa?\" asked the officer suspiciously. \"Ehh...No this is how I always talk you know?\" responded Rocky frowning now. Another officer looked at Rocky and sighed looking at his partner \"He's always had that slurrred speech.\" \"Oh.\" The officer frowned and understood. The officers took Rocky's statement and left. \"Yo Paulie I think we better forget about Andy's today. Let's go home.\" Rocky said. \"So I take it...I lost two quarters cuz some girl actually kicked a couple of scumbags' asses?\" Paulie asked rather agitated to Rocky walking home now. Rocky shrugged. He was still amazed at the young woman he met. She was strong. He told Paulie all about her. \"These titans are just letting it go!\" the first announcer said ecstatic at the spectacle. \"Berbick launches blow after blow!\" a second announcer started. \"Gunn is getting angry. Look at the determination. Apparently wanting to see more damage coming out of Trevor!\" the first announcer began again. Gunn's manager Duke was outside the ring next to his corner yelling at him to win the fight. Tommy Gunn usually didn't have to take long to finish off his opponent. But today it looked like an exception. Berbick, an african-american who looked like a double for Apollo Creed, was holding his own against Tommy Gunn. Tommy Gunn kept throwing punch after punch to him but no matter how the blows were, Trevor kept coming for more. \"Come on you bum! Finish him already!\" yelled Duke in desperation. Tommy couldn't figure out why Berbick was still coming at him. 'Why won't he go down?' Tommy yelled in his mind. Now Tommy began sparring until there was nothing left of him. The crowd instantly booed as he retaliated. People all over the country had seen the street fight between Tommy and Rocky and the crowd thought Gunn was a monster for beating up a true champion like Rocky as well as a few other people whom were at the scene. They wanted to see him go down. Right now, the crowd was bothering Tommy and he had half a mind to tell them to shut up but he took out his frustration on Berbick instead who was still standing. \"Berbick is still standing. He's got to be made of steel to take a tremendous beating from Gunn!\" said the first announcer. Excited, the second announcer responded. \"More like iron instead!\" he chuckled. Now Berbick was throwing his own punches and the crowd cheered for him. He began sparring, hitting Tommy's face repeatedly for about 5 seconds. He then went for Gunn's ribs. Tommy felt stunned with every blow. Trevor hit him in his abs and threw a left to Gunn's face which was a hard one for Tommy staggered off. ....Punch after punch!\" the announcer droned. With renewed strength, a heavily bruised Berbick launched his attack rather fiercely and bravely. He then threw a right across Gunn's face. His gloves connected toward his stomach again and again. Berbick wanted to cause agony to the man who had betrayed a legend like Rocky Balboa. 'This man is a disgrace.' he thought. He managed to block a few of Gunn's punches and went at it with courage. The crowd was now cheering \"Berbick! Berbick!\" He was now sending an impressive plan: two left hits with a hard right. Trevor was a beast now. Tommy felt dazed with that hard right that he fell back toward the ropes. He was now in pain. \"Come on what are you doin Boy? This is the championship we're talking about!\" Duke yelled behind him aside from everyone in the entire arena chanting Trevor's name. \"You lose and you're finished remember?\" he threatened. After a pause Tommy of thinking at what Duke just said, he felt angry that he should not be taken down and practically ran at Berbick. He growled in frustration and threw a rather slow punch which Trevor evaded and instead found himself being hit again in the face repeatedly. \"Gunn's losing control. You can see it on his face!\" the second announcer said. The crowd was more ecstatic than ever. Berbick then aimed a hit on Tommy's right hip which connected. He proceeded to hit Gunn again in the face. Gunn threw several punches, none of them made a dent to Berbick. As he ducked from another of Gunn's punches, Trevor delivered the coup de grace. He gave him a hard right and Gunn now fell with a thud that caused people to rise from their seats and cheer. The referee was standing near Gunn and counted \"1, 2, 3....\" Tommy rolled slowly. Duke and his girlfriend Karen were both yelling \"GET UP!\" repeatedly. \"4, 5, 6....\" the announcer continued. Trevor began to breathe heavily and was ready if Tommy got up. Gunn was in a crouching position using the ropes to get up. \"7, 8, 9...\" Tommy was now on the second rope but it was too late. He heard the final number and fell back to the ground of the ring. The crowd roared with tremendous applause and cheered for Trevor Berbick, raising his hands wearily. He was exhausted. His trainers and manager surrounded him. George Washington Duke stared down at a defeated Tommy Gunn lying on the ground of the ring. \"You finished!\" he snarled and climbed out of the ring. Tommy took a look at his girlfriend Karen who shook her head in disapproval and walked away with Duke. He was alone now. Tommy Gunn did the only thing he could think of, he cried. \"What a battle!\" said one of the announcers. Somewhere in the state of California, a fight took place in an arena with hundreds of spectators cheering for one of their favorite combatants. In a half an hour it was all over and one came out the winner. Trevor Berbick, an unknown fighter was now the heavyweight champion of the world. He had won the title from Tommy Gunn. Rocky opened the door to his warm home and waited for Paulie to enter who was busy putting out his cigar. \"Yo Adrian! I'm home.\" He said. Adrian was wearing a gray sweater and had her hair in a ponytail. \"How was your day?\" \"Interestin'\" replied Paulie. Rocky nodded slowly with his eyebrows raised as if to say \"you had no idea.\" \"What happened?\" she asked concerned. Rocky told her of the young woman in the alley and how she managed to beat her attackers. Adrian was appalled by the story. \"My goodness.\" she said surprised. \"Hey dad, you won't believe what just happened!\" Robert ran to his father in excitement. \"That's funny something happened too.\" Rocky chuckled. Robert said quickly. \"Tommy lost the world heavyweight championship!\" \"What?! and I wasn't there?\" said a shocked Paulie and chuckled. \"I knew he was going to get his. Everything balances eh Rocko?\" Rocky on the other hand looked indifferent and thought about what he just heard now. There was a knock on the door. Everyone looked at it. \"Who could be here at this hour?\" replied Adrian. Rocky opened the door and saw a familiar young woman; it was Jackie who looked as if she ran. \"Hey.\" she simply said looking at him. Rocky looked confused. \"Hey uh whatcha doin' here?\" he asked. \"I need a place to stay.\" she said simply. Part 4 coming up soon don't worry![Chapter 4] Chapter 4 The young woman Jackie was wearing a faded jeans jacket which was ripped in a couple of places. Her beautiful face covered in soot and sweat had Rocky feeling a little sorry for her. \"Yeah sure.\" He said after thinking about it for a long time. Rocky looked back at Adrian and Paulie. \"Could she stay for a while?\" he asked. Paulie looked as if he was trying to refrain from rolling his eyes. Adrian on the other hand said \"Yes of course.\" Rocky was happy seeing the young beautiful woman who had defended her own life from three lowlifes an hour ago. Rocky had caught up with her to see if she was all right. Jackie offered her name to him and nothing else. She then ran away. Jackie only had a jeans jacket that looked faded and worn out. Her jeans had dirt on them. There was something about her face which despite the sweat and dirt it had on; underneath it there was a kind girl. She seemed to be a lost light. Rocky thought about all this and allowed her in. Adrian seemed a bit reluctant at first. Adrian always thought that Rocky seemed to made it a habit helping the homeless. Adrian allowed a similar homeless person like Jackie who took advantage of her husband: Tommy Gunn . She saw Rocky allowing her in. She said hi to Adrian, Paulie, and Robert with gratitude. \"Hello.\" She greeted quietly. Adrian nodded and said hi as well. As she got a brief look at the girl's green eyes, there seemed to be something indeed unique about her. Adrian thought this girl really did need help. \"You've done a lot. I hate to ask this but may I use the restroom please?\" \"Not much too ask but yeah sure.\" Rocky said. \"Thanks.\" she said. Adrian showed her where the bathroom was. Young Robert looked perplexed at the newcomer as she entered the bathroom. \"Who's she?\" Rocky told his son how he found her and how she won the fight against her attackers. \"Whoa!\" Robert said impressed. \"That was awesome!\" Robert visualized the fight in his mind. Soon the family then had dinner which consisted of chicken, steak and salad. \"Compliments of Adrian.\" said Rocky smiling at his wife. Jackie thanked them again. \"You didn't have to go through all that trouble.\" \"Nah it ain't no trouble.\" said Rocky. \"Just as long as you don't take up the TV too much.\" said Paulie. \"Paulie.\" Adrian warned. Paulie then kept quiet. \"It's just… I'm not homeless or anything.\" Jackie said a bit defensively. She seemed no to want anyone to feel sorry for her. \"It's just I came here from New York and I haven't found an apartment yet.\" \"Did you go downtown to find an apartment?\" Adrian asked. \"I didn't get a chance to. I was busy sightseeing before I almost got mugged.\" She said. \"I'm just glad you're alright.\" Adrian said worried. \"This neighborhood can be violent at times.\" She added. Rocky had to ask this question. He was dying to find out how she learned to fight. \"So who taught you to fight like that?\" he finally asked. \"Well…\" Jackie said a bit embarrassed but hid it by chuckling weakly. \"I used to box at this gym in New York. My uh… father taught me before he…\" she stopped and looked sad. She put a hand on her forehead. Rocky thought she was about to cry. \"Yo I'm sorry.\" He put his hand on her shoulder. Adrian looked as if she was heartbroken. Paulie shook his head in disbelief and went back to eat. \"No that's okay I'm alright. It was a long time ago. These shouldn't happen but they do.\" She shrugged. Rocky thought the conversation needed to change. \"So you used to box.\" He said recovering. \"Yeah…\" Jackie said after wiping her tears. \"I also took up martial arts as a 'back up' as my dad aptly put it at the time. I always wondered why he taught me all of this. Pretty soon I became very good at it. My dad said it was my gift. To fight. It seems to be the only thing I'm good at. He told me one thing before he died that I will never forget.\" She said thoughtfully. \"What was that?\" Rocky asked curiously. \"Fight when it's right.\" she said simply. \"Basically he meant that real fighting was using your head and physical fighting was when you had no other alternative.\" Adrian looked thoughtfully for a moment and then at her husband Rocky. She had always given him lectures as to why he shouldn't fight. She smiled at her. Jackie finished her meal as soon as they were done. \"Seriously I just want to stay for a few days. I should be able to find a place to stay. I don't want to be a nuisance.\" Jackie said. \"You can stay here as long as you want.\" said Rocky reassuringly. \"That's right.\" replied Adrian in a loving tone. Rocky looked at Adrian and smiled. She understood as he did that this girl was special. \"Thanks.\" she said with tears in her eyes now. The Balboa family wasted no time in trying to consider Jackie as a part of their family. Rocky gave Jackie a place to rest downstairs. In the Philadelphia suburbia, a limo sped by. A 50 year old man stuck his head out the window to look at the house in front of him. It was Rocky's. He then got out and left a manila envelope in the doormat. \"You gonna be mine!\" George Washington Duke declared. The next day Rocky along with Robert took Jackie to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was only right to show her the attractive sights of Philadelphia. The museum was highly popular. \"So I'm guessing these steps are famous because of you.\" Jackie said breathless after walking them. \"He's the stair master.\" said Robert. They all chuckled. \"Used to be…\" Rocky said. \"Not that fast again.\" He said thoughtfully. \"So this is where it all started huh?\" Jackie asked looking down at the steps. She admired how Rocky Balboa managed to run up the steps. \"Yeah…those were the days.\" He pointed at his statue which was himself with his hands thrown in the air as if in victory. \"He's just being modest. My dad will always be tough and strong.\" said Robert. He had always admired his father. As they approached the entrance to the museum, Jackie began conversing with young Robert who she began to get along with. \"What about you? Thinking about being a boxer yourself one day?\" \"I don't know about that. I rather try something else.\" Robert said. As much as he loved his father, he could never be like him. \"I guess a person has to go his own way.\" Jackie simply said. Rocky looked at both Jackie and Robert and smiled. It was nice for Robert to talk to somebody especially someone like her. They entered the museum unaware that someone was watching them from the shadows. Somewhere in another realm, in another time, A black man was rising from the ground. He opened his eyes and slowly looked around. The area was covered in fog and everything seemed to glow white. He was surprised to find himself in a ring, a boxing ring. He sat up instantly and tried to survey his surroundings more. 'What happened?' the man thought. He struggled to remember how he came here. 'I was fighting that big Russian Drago and then everything seemed to go....\" He stopped and realized with incredulity. \"I'm...\" \"Dead?\" someone answered. He looked behind him and saw a short old man with thinning white hair coming from a cloud of smoke walking towards him. \"Yeah I tell ya. It gets crazy the first few seconds.\" He mumbled looking around. \"But it makes sense. You got knocked out pretty hard kid.\" Narrowing his eyes at him, the man realized that he was Rocky Balboa's trainer. \"Wait a minute. Are you...Mr. Goodwill, Rocky's manager?\" He stood up to face him properly. \"Yeah.\" he said and looked back at him. \"And I can't believe I'm actually saying this but I'm your guide...Apollo.\" Apollo Creed looked surprised. He gave Mickey Goodwill a confused look. Mickey simply smiled at his reaction.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 In the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Rocky alongside with his son Robert and newcomer Jackie surveyed the paintings around them. Robert eager as he was to learn new things went up to one with excitement. \"Ooh! Look!\" Rocky and Jackie went to his side to see what he was looking at. \"So what's this one called?\" Rocky asked out of curiosity. \"I've seen it before.\" Robert said examining it. \"But I can't remember what it's called.\" He frowned. \"It's Vincent Van Gogh's 'Vase with twelve flowers.'\" replied Jackie. \"I kinda already knew that.\" Rocky joked. Robert shook his head smiling. The painting consisted of a pot with a few different colored flowers in it. \"Yeah it is to the point.\" She nodded. \"It's a still life portrait made in 1888 by Van Gogh. It's supposed to represent emotions. The color of each flower has a life depending what color it is. Every different color is basically a different emotion.\" Jackie said matter of factly. \"That sounds interesting.\" said an intrigued Robert. \"Flowers are nice.\" Rocky nodded. \"They show love and caring and everything like that.\" He said. \"Never thought you were a man of many emotions Rocky.\" said a smiling Jackie. Rocky chuckled at what she said but then he frowned as he looked deeper into the painting. The picture actually had Rocky thinking. 'Is this the kind of man I am? A man with too much emotion?' He asked himself. Rocky had a good heart, he knew that but what had it done for him lately? He went from riches to streets because he wasn't careful. Rocky was indestructible on the outside but in the inside, he was too soft. \"How do you know so much about art?\" Robert asked Jackie with interest. \"I studied them back in college. Apparently there are some things you don't forget.\" she said. Rocky, Robert and Jackie moved onto another painting ahead. After they were done looking at the paintings, the group decided to head home. It was getting late. \"What an evening huh?\" Rocky asked her as they walked down a street. \"Yeah. Seriously thank you for showing me the museum. I had lots of fun.\" Jackie looked at both Rocky and Robert kindly. \"It ain't no problem. Me and Robert go racing up to the museum all the time.\" Rocky said. \"Yeah and I always win.\" Robert replied mischievously. \"Really?\" Jackie looked at Rocky surprised that his son could outrun him. \"Hey there was that one time remember?\" Rocky smiled. \"But I still beat you though.\" Robert said in a 'duh' tone. Soon they faked punched one another. It was all good fun at its best. Jackie couldn't help but laugh at the humor. She really did seem to get along well with the Balboa family. To her, they were full of light and warmth. She felt a connection instantly with all of them. Rocky then hugged his son. The wonderful, heart-breaking scene changed however when a huge figure jumped out from the shadows and hit her knocking her out. \"Jackie?\" Rocky went to her side but stopped when he saw the figure reveal himself. Robert went at his father's side as the hulking menace approached them. Robert gasped immediately. Rocky instantly recognized the young man approaching them with sheer hatred in his eyes. He wore a disheveled blue and white jacket and had blond hair. It was Tommy Gunn. He still had the bruises from his recent fight. Breathing hard, he spoke. \"I want a rematch!\" he growled. \"Tommy…\" Rocky tried to calm him down. \"Why you doin' this?\" \"Because of you, I lost everything!\" Tommy cried. \"No…\" Rocky shook his head sadly. \"You lost everything yourself!\" he yelled now. \"You let that guy confuse you! You let him take your soul!\" \"He gave me everything and you ruined it!\" Tommy cried. \"How? How did I ruin it? I tried to teach you that you got to fight on the inside Tommy!. Me training you, it had to take time. That's how I did it…\" Rocky went on. While Rocky was talking, Jackie who was still lying on the ground heard everything and woke up. \"I knew you had problems but money don't always fix them. You have to fight them without it. That's real winning!\" Rocky yelled. Despite the situation, Robert looked at his father with admiration and smiled at him. Unfortunately Tommy scoffed at his words and charged at him. \"Dad watch out!\" yelled Robert. Rocky however was ready and raised his fists. Tommy yelling like a monster threw the first punch and it was a fast one. Rocky wasn't sure if he can block it. But soon an angel blocked Rocky's path and dodged his punch. Rocky looked shocked as soon as she did that. \"Jackie what are you doin'?\" Jackie ignored him and engaged Tommy Gunn giving him a fast punch to his chest and the next one to his face. \"You little..!\" Tommy now concentrated on Jackie. He sent a few punches which she ducked. Jackie analyzed Tommy Gunn immediately. He relied on strength but not on speed. Robert looked astounded as Jackie punched him in the gut, gave another one in his right cheek and gave an incredible spinning kick to it making him fall down. \"You're not supposed to hit girls buddy!\" Jackie said looking down at him. Rocky and Robert went to her side. \"You OK?\" \"Yeah don't worry about it.\" she said. Rocky looked down at his former protégé who was writhing in the ground in pain. Rocky shook his head in disappointment. \"I'm sorry I didn't teach you about the wrong things Tommy.\" he looked back at Jackie who was amazed at her skills as always. He nodded in approval. Jackie smiled at his reaction. The fight was short lived but Rocky was sure glad Jackie wasn't hurt. Suddenly loud sirens were heard followed by the blaring red lights. They approached them and stopped. It was the police. Apparently someone somewhere saw the disturbance and called them. Rocky heard Jackie gasped. Rocky however was content that Tommy was going to jail. \"Yo, it's alright officers she's OK and everything.\" Rocky said casually to the approaching officers. \"She won't be.\" One of the officers said. The officer pointed at her. \"You're under arrest.\" Rocky did a double take. \"What? Whoa! Whoa! Why?\" In a surprising turn of events, the officer handcuffed Jackie who said to Rocky. \"It's alright...\" she told Rocky a bit frustrated. The officer had just arrived to the \"You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will….\" Part. \"You can't just arrest her!\" yelled Robert. \"At least tell us what she is being charged for!\" yelled Rocky to one of them. \"Murder.\" The second officer said. Rocky became silent for a full five seconds. \"No…\" Rocky couldn't believe it. He looked at Jackie who had tears in her eyes. Rocky and Robert stood paralyzed. He watched Jackie in sadness as she was being led away to one of the police cars and Tommy Gunn was being led away in the other wearing a victorious smile. In a world full of blue and white light, Apollo Creed, wearing nothing but his shorts and shoes sat next to Rocky Balboa's trainer, Mickey. The ropes above them looked real but felt like air as he touched them. At first he thought it was ludicrous. It was so bizarre. Why him? \"Why me? I haven't got a clue. I ain't the guide material.\" He said. \"There's gotta be a reason you're supposed to help me. But why you? We never even met.\"Apollo said confused. \"I don't spin the world kid. I just take the orders.\" Mickey shook his head. \"though…we do have one thing in common.\" Mickey looked at Apollo as if he already knew himself. Apollo nodded. \"Rocky.\" \"Yep. Kid sure is special.\" Mickey then gave a deep sigh. \"I never got the chance to tell him that.\" Apollo gave a look of comprehension and discontent. \"Well why are we here? Is this heaven?\" \"Nope. It's a place between worlds or something like that. 'They'…\" Mickey motioned upward. \"told me that I had to show you what Rocky has done and what is yet to come.\" \"Who is 'they'?\" Apollo desperately asked. \"Angels, spirits, whatever you want to call them. They don't even speak English and somehow I still understand them.\" He gave a soft chuckle and stopped. \"Rocky needs help.\" He finished. Apollo frowned at his response. Back to reality, Rocky and Robert ran up to his doorsteps and got into his house. He had to tell Adrian what has happened. \"Yo Adrian!\" he cried out. He found Adrian and Paulie sitting each sharing looks of despair. On the table was a brown envelope. \"Yo Adrian, Jackie got arrested.\" He said out of breath. He finally noticed their looks. \"What's goin' on?\" he asked. \"We're in trouble Rock.\" said Paulie shaking his head and pointed the envelope with his cigar. \"What is it?\" \"It's from Duke.\" Adrian replied sadly. Rocky cautiously opened the envelope and inside he found several documents including a note that he noticed the most. \"I HAVE COPIES.\" He went through the documents next. \"Those are Jackie's criminal records.\" Adrian said. Rocky looked at her and went back to the note which said \"ROCKY BALBOA, BY NOW YOU HAVE MET THAT PRETTY GIRL JACKIE. I KNOW HER BEFORE SHE EVEN SHOWED UP TO YOUR DOORSTEP. WE WERE WELL ACQUAINTED TWO YEARS AGO. LIKE YOU, SHE TURNED ME DOWN. SHE WAS SO STUPID REFUSING MONEY I COULD HAVE PROMISED HER. I ALSO KNOW ABOUT THAT TROUBLE SHE CAUSED A LONG TIME AGO. ME AND TOMMY HAD A PLAN TO GET HER ARRESTED. TOMMY PLANNED TO GO DOWN EASILY. YOU WANT HER OUT OF JAIL PERMANENTLY? GET HER TO FIGHT TOMMY GUNN AGAIN. YOU HAVE THREE MONTHS TO TRAIN HER. I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS MONEY ON PROMOTING THIS. IT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST MALE/FEMALE FIGHT. SHE LOSES, SHE GOES BACK TO JAIL AND I WILL OWN YOUR PRECIOUS COMMUNITY, IF YOU BOTH WIN, HER CRIMINAL HISTORY WILL BE HISTORY. THIS FIGHT IS OFFICIAL BALBOA. YOU KNOW SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE. CONSIDER THIS PAYBACK. CALL ME FOR MORE INFORMATION. SINCERELY, GEORGE WASHINGTON DUKE.\" \"It's all over the news too Rocko.\" nodded Paulie. Rocky crumbled up the note in anger. Robert looked at him. \"What are you going to do dad?\" Paulie, Adrian also looked at him waiting to hear his response. Rocky sighed and put his hands on the table, thinking. He looked at all of them. Adrian always warned him about fighting. \"Fight when it's right. Right?\" he asked her. She thought this too and finally nodded at her husband.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 \"So you're going to fight again?\" Adrian asked her husband. She knew he was going to have to but had to be sure. \"Him fighting?\" Paulie asked confused. \"It's that girl that punk Tommy has to fight.\" He turned to Rocky. \"Rocko, even I know she's got no chance. Tell him to reconsider.\" Rocky shook his head in frustration. \"I knew something like this was going to happen. I knew it wasn't over.\" The situation was a big one and Rocky knew that it was one he didn't know he could win. \"Rocko I think you better call this guy soon.\" Paulie said. Rocky paused and thought about this hard. ' Fight when it's right…but how?' he asked himself. 'I can't see what I'm fightin' at! \" Rocky was almost panicking now and tried to remain calm. He had to talk to Jackie about this soon. \"If it's me he wants…he'll get me.\" Rocky concluded miserably and went to the phone to call Duke. \"Rocky No!\" Adrian started. She knew what he meant. \"Are you crazy?!\" Paulie also objected. \"Rocky don't do this. Don't let this man take away your dignity. There has to be some other way.\" Adrian said sadly. \"You're not doing what I think you're doing are you?\" \"It's the only way to save us! And the whole town!\" Rocky said. While he dialed the phone number, Rocky saw the glances that Adrian and Paulie gave him that expressed disappointment. He heard the phone ring. \"You guys probably don't want to listen to this.\" he said and immediately Adrian and Paulie left. Rocky thought hard as to what he was about to do. \"It's degrading! A woman fighting a man? It's insane George!\" There was a heated argument between two men walking quickly down a random hallway in a stadium in New York City. George Washington Duke had just addressed to the Philadelphia people and possibly the whole country about a very special fight he made. News and other media were on the subject immediately and even after Duke left the podium, he was immediately surrounded by reporters asking questions especially one that made him very angry. ' Mr. Duke, are you a monster? ' Duke almost went off that moment but he calmed down quickly. It was a miracle he got out of the crowd. Right now, Merlin Sheets, George's partner objected his actions. Duke was already getting annoyed. Duke was bother by Merlin's morals. ' Since when did he get soft?' he thought. Duke dodged his beggings and instead went on going over the possibilities of what may come. Duke thought it was a win-win. \"You know this is gonna be over quick. I just gave Balboa a choice and obviously he's going to make the right one.\" \"George…you just spent millions upon millions of dollars, which is all you had, on making a fight where one opponent, a female, will have no chance of winning?\" \"Exactly! The girl will lose and I get Balboa. It's as simple as that!\" Merlin also wanted to go over what happened between Tommy Gunn and the girl. Merlin knew that the police arrested both Tommy and her. The question was why was Tommy there to begin with? Duke had already told him and that further increased his frustration. \"I thought Tommy Gunn was out George.\" Merlin said while trying to calm himself down. He was still confused as to how Tommy was involved. Duke sighed out loud. He didn't want to go over that. He was busy thinking. He shrugged and said. \"I said he was 'finished' being in anything that concerns the media.\" He looked back at the doors where he came from escaping the crowd of news reporters. \"The only thing he's good for now is fighting in clubs and that's if he's lucky. But I gave him an opportunity to help me get Jackie in on this. Long story short, Tommy wants another shot at fame. I told him that it is his last and final chance to prove himself to me. He fails well,….he'll just go out with the rest of the garbage. Call it his way of goin out for good.\" He added coldly. Merlin thought George looked maniacal. He shook his head. \"I have been with you for years George but this fight you've made…You're risking even your own wealth?! It's asinine! You have lost all sense when you first started this with Rocky, with Tommy Gunn, everything. The public literally hates you and I can't say I blame them. You've gone too far. I'll have no part in it whatsoever!\" He said bravely. Duke stopped and so did Merlin. He began speaking seriously now. \"You better watch what you say Merlin because when you say you want no part in it, you know what that means.\" Duke said with a hint of warning in his voice. After a full five seconds of thinking of what he had just said, he finally answered. \"I do George.\" He nodded. Merlin understood completely. \"Yes you do.\" Duke said. His phone suddenly rang as soon as he finished. \"George Washington Duke.\" He said as soon as he opened a gray thick portable phone from his thick, fur coat. It was heavy and exhausting to carry around. ' When are they going to invent small light phones?\" he asked himself angrily. \"Yo Duke it's me Rocky.\" Duke instantly smiled. \"Hey Rock! I take it you got the message?\" he mocked. \"Yeah and I wanted to talk to you something about that.\" He chuckled. \"Let's hear it.\" Duke said and listened intently. Duke then walked away leaving Merlin alone with his head lowered, as if in shame. Merlin had nothing now. \"What do you mean Rocky needs help?\" Apollo asked. He was now even more confused that Rocky was in trouble, let alone being in a 'limbo' world. \"Ehh…if there's one they know, it's the future. They told me that Rocky is gonna end up in a big problem. Rocky's the whole reason we're here kid.\" \"I still don't get this.\" Apollo said and got up. \"I don't- I don't understand!\" He was beginning to get agitated. Apollo didn't seem to be getting answers. \"This ain't Heaven. This ain't Hell, this is some…\" Apollo couldn't bring himself to curse in a place like this. \"This doesn't make sense! This place doesn't make any sense! What are you supposed to show me anyway?!\" he asked Mickey looking down at him. \"Well now you got me all riled up!\" Mickey managed to get up and faced Apollo. \"You were Rocky's first opponent and now you went on and train 'im? Now even I know it was because of some…bond formed. But why did you help him? What made you be…friends with im?\" Apollo paused and looked away. He seemed to hesitate. \"Well it's obvious, I trained Rocky because he's a good fighter and he was going on a bad road with you being...\" Mickey raised an eyebrow. Apollo knew that look. \"You know.\" He finally said and continued. \"Rocky had something in him no other fighter had, an unbreakable spirit. Now, when you have an unbreakable spirit, there's no stopping you. And I respected him for that. He reminded me of me. I had nothing growing up and when I made my way up people told me I was special. It bothered me. For the longest time, I fought fighters who were too inferior. I wanted to find someone who was just like me. But then the money came along and I forgot what I was fighting for. Then Rocky came along.\" He said. It was Mickey's turn to speak. \"Ehh…I really hated you, you know? You just got me thinking now. You were the reason I worked Rocky too hard. I wanted Rocky to be tough as iron! The unbreakable spirit or whatever you want to call it was there but it needed to be shown. I'm glad he fought ya.\" He said a bit resentfully. Apollo smiled. \"Bet that hurt to say huh?\" \"Well…nothing hurts here.\" Mickey said. After a long pause, Mickey said. \"Voices tell me it's time to show you what happened after you went down. Basically show you everything Rocky has done leading up to what's going to happen.\" \"Lead the way then skip.\" Apollo said still smiling and instantly saw bright white light surrounding him. Moscow, Russia It was months later after his fight and a 6'5'' 260 pound man could stop thinking about what had happened. The outcome was overwhelming to him. Standing outside of his expensive house, Ivan Drago was busy contemplating. It was the first time he had done such thinking ever since he lost to an American fighter who was the only person to surprise him, Rocky Balboa. Months later had turned Drago disheveled with a beard and took up a habit of smoking. He went back to fighting in clubs and events whenever he got the chance. It was funny to think that even after fighting Rocky Balboa, Drago wound up back to where he started and it didn't seem the same. Drago could not stop thinking about Rocky. The man was almost half his size and he amazingly took him down. Rubbing a scar that has since healed up but left a mark, it kept reminding him that he was indeed 'mortal.' He felt a hint of humiliation but then proud for some reason. He had a great respect now for Balboa. He had shown him that he wasn't indestructible as he thought. As much as he liked making money fighting and using steroids, he didn't enjoy it. That was the only reason he felt humiliated, the fact that he had used strength enhancements. Even as a kid, Drago was teased for being tall and superior. People were almost afraid of him. Pretty soon, he was treated like a lab rat and fought countless opponents who had no chance of winning. It felt good that he no longer thought of himself as a monster. Drago wanted so much to thank Rocky and also apologize to him but knew very well that Balboa would never forgive him for killing his friend, Apollo Creed. \"The monster who has a heart after all.\" A voice said in Russian. Ivan's wife Ludmilla stood next to him. There was sarcasm in her tone. \"I'm not a monster anymore.\" Ivan said indifferently in Russian. \"Being a monster gave you money and fame. Ironic is it not?\" \"What is your point?\" Drago was getting frustrated. Ludmilla sighed. \"What do you want to do now? That is my point.\" \"I know you are disappointed in me. So just say it and leave it at that.\" Drago said. \"You feel embarrassed not disappointed that Rocky beat you. I do admit I can see what people in America mean when they say he is a true champion. He did change me too you know, Surprising don't you think?\" \"Funny I see you the same.\" Ivan said. \"True what with the…new fight in America coming soon.\" \"You heard.\" \"Yes I did.\" \"The man promoting the fight is the monster not me. The man bothers me.\" \"Rocky Balboa lost everything. You still have everything. Let it go.\" Ludmilla then left leaving Drago alone. Confused by his wife's conversation, Ivan simply asked himself.\" If I have everything why do I feel this way? I hate this anxiety!\" He walked back to the house. A figure stood outside a gym and looked through the window. The entrance to the building had a sign on the door that said \"WOMEN ONLY!,\" naturally the man could only see through the window. The figure saw in amazement women hitting punching bags, several were doing exercises such as jump ropes and pull-ups. The man could make out a ring in the middle of the room and in it were two women sparring. Several trainers encouraged their trainees to keep going. This made the figure smile in pride. Rocky Balboa then felt confident all of a sudden and eagerly went to see Jackie. A half hour later, Rocky made his way in the jail with the help of a guard and eventually he found himself to the visiting booth as the guard pointed it out to him. He was sitting facing a small glass wall with a phone next to it. The young woman Jackie looked defeated as she sat down. She was in an orange jumpsuit. They were both sitting on either side of the glass. She grabbed her phone and Rocky picked up his. \"Hey.\" Rocky said. \"I take it you're here to tell me I'm disappointing.\" said Jackie with a sigh. \"Why didn't you tell me you were charged with murder?\" He asked. \"It was just something I wanted to get rid of. If I brought it up, all those feelings would come back. I just wanted that to be in the past.\" Jackie said and started to cry. \"I brought this upon you and I'm sorry.\" She sobbed. \"I won't make you tell me what happened. All I can tell you is that it's not your fault. It's mine Jackie.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I allowed this to happen. Duke is too.... what's that word that means wanting something even though you're being told no but you keep wanting to anyway?\" \"Persistent?\" \"Yeah that. I should never have met him.\" Rocky said. \"This isn't your fault Rocky. We just have a common enemy.\" \"He wants you to fight Tommy Gunn.\" Jackie nodded. \"I know. All the girls are giving me a hard time about it. They don't think I can win and I'm inclined to agree.\" \"I called him. I wanted to tell him that he should leave you alone and I was going to give myself to him. He wants to be my manager you know?\" He shook his head and looked frustrated. \"But then...I thought about it.\" \"And?\" \"I just told him... you were going to win.\" He said boldly. Jackie looked shocked. \"Why would you even think that?\" \"Because you got me.\" He smiled. Jackie felt happy at that moment. Rocky then told her about the conditions Duke made out. He also told her about the training he had planned. \"Do you think you can do it?\" Jackie simply said. \"I'll try.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Rocky laid himself down on the sofa with a frustrated look on his face. He came back from visiting Jackie in prison. He wanted to tell everyone what he was planning to do. But before he did, everyone was watching the TV with misery planted on each of their faces. Adrian, Paulie and Robert were watching the news in the living room. He looked at what they were watching. His expression was almost identical to everyone seated in the living room. The news reported was going on and on with the fight taking place in half a year. Duke's face was shown on the screen. \"The reason…I'm doing this is because heck! I believe women can fight. I'm a gentleman and I want to give this young lady a shot. Women want to prove their worth, I say, 'let's see what you got then.' She goes down, she goes down. Once the town is mine, I'll do everything to make sure it goes into the twenty-first century two decades early. Everything stays the same right ?\" he rambled to a reporter. The lead anchorman's face was then shown. \"I can fairly say this is going to be the most shocking and surprising fight of the century. For the first time ever, a woman will go one on one with a man in a boxing match. If she loses, the township in Philadelphia will be under control by George Washington Duke. The mayor, as well as the citizens are appalled by this match. Already, soon-to-be spectators give us their opinions on the upcoming fight.\" a sports newscaster was shown in one of the segments before it went to the next one. \"It's an embarrassment. This man should be ashamed of himself. I'm already giving out petitions sanctioning the fight.\" a woman in her fifties stated. \"It's bad enough we're going to lose our neighborhood because of this (beep) but now he has to humiliate a woman and women in general on (beep) pay-per-view?\" a young woman stated. The mayor's face was shown next. He was talking to news reporters and stood behind the podium. \"It is with great regret that I am saying that I have no power to overrule this man. George Washington Duke is more powerful than myself. He has our city clenched in his fist and we, unfortunately, are forced to deal with it. The fate of our city rests in this woman's hands now. Alderman John...\" the mayor was going on when Paulie muttered his opinion. \"The media is going crazy over this.\" Paulie said shaking his head in disapproval. \"Feminist and women empowerment groups are taking this seriously and I don't blame them. They believe that this woman is being degraded and if she loses this fight, it will make women look weak. That's the issue.\" Adrian explained. \"We'll also lose this city too.\" Paulie muttered and shook his head. With his cigar, he threw his ash on the screen. \"Paulie.\" Adrian said sternly. Paulie waved her off. Rocky sat with an angry expression on his face for a few seconds. He tried to analyze the situation. It was a big one indeed and there was only one alternative. He stood up now. \"Paulie get the gym open.\" he said with determination. \"But it's Thursday. Gym's closed on thursday.\" Paulie frowned. \"Guys, look in a couple of minutes, the cops is gonna bring Jackie here under our custody.\" \"What? Why?\" Adrian asked. \"I'm doing it Adrian. I'm going to train her.\" Everyone looked at Rocky in utter surprise. Blinding, white light was everywhere surrounding the area. It showed constantly for what seemed like an eternity. It finally stopped and two figures materialized in a large unknown stadium. There was a large crowd cheering loudly. The crowd looked foreign. People were yelling with excitement and with sheer enthusiasm to match. Apollo Creed and Mickey Goodmill made their way down to the entrance of the match. As far as he was concerned, Apollo naturally assumed no one could see both he and Mickey, so he continued to walk on despite the crowd of spectators in their way. They made their way down to the arena where the ring came into view. Apollo was in a state of utter surprise. He was in shock looking at the two combatants fighting. Now he knew why the crowd was going crazy. \"Well, ain't that somethin'?\" said Mickey in wonder. Apollo nodded absentmindedly. He was busy watching his friend Rocky going against the boxer who had killed him, Ivan Drago. Apollo looked on as he saw Rocky being hit repeatedly and kept on standing. Apollo could not help but feel a bit happy that his friend continued the fight for him. He made his way closer until he was actually below the ring with his old trainer, Tony who he was surprised to see as well as Rocky's friend Paulie. Apollo stood with them even though they couldn't see him. \"Come on Rock!\" he said as hung on to the ropes from the outside. \"Hey get down! He can't even hear ya!\" Mickey said and also went to see clearer. Rocky hit back as best he could. But there seemed to be no way in taking down the monstrous behemoth Ivan. Apollo kept trying to call out to Rocky to no avail to provide support. He had to help to him. \"Rock remember eye of the ti-\" but he was cut off. \"He can't hear ya I said. Listen basically, he fought the guy for ya. To prove to anyone, that he was no chump and that you wasn't no chump either.\" Mickey said sadly. \"He did it because he liked ya. You taught him more than I ever did.\" Apollo looked at him sadly as well and looked back at the ring. Rocky took all the hits. Every hit made by the towering monster made seemed to have no effect. Apollo remembered then how Ivan's punches felt and yet he was still amazed that Rocky was still standing. The man seemed to be made of steel, Apollo thought. The round ended and Rocky made his way to his post where Tony came to his side. He was tending to his wounds on his face. Rocky looked almost defeated. \"What round is it?\" Rocky muttered. \"Last round. To win, you gotta win by a knockout!\" Tony said. Apollo looked around when the crowd started to chant Rocky's name. He smiled and looked back at Rocky and Tony. \"All your strength, all your power, alright? No pain, No pain!\" Tony said with encouragement. Rocky repeated the words as well. \"Come on.\" Apollo whispered. Apollo looked on as Rocky went back in. A few minutes in, Rocky took massive punches that could make dents on walls by Drago. But now, he was hitting back overwhelming Drago and that was when Apollo had an expression of sheer excitement. Apollo saw him hitting Drago's stomach and hit him back on his face. Smiling, he cried out despite the fact that he wouldn't be heard. \"COME ON!\" The crowd stood up in sheer excitement and astonishment as for the first time, Ivan Drago was knocked down. Apollo unseen, cheered as well with tears in his eyes. Waking up from his dream, a tall, blond man sat on his bed contemplating what he had just dreamt and tried to replay it again in his mind. Apparently what had happened months ago was still on the young man's mind. He couldn't take it anymore. The fact that he was still thinking about the fight meant one thing, he had to find Rocky and talk to him. Ivan Drago went to the kitchen and took out a half-drunken protein shake in a bottle. He took a swig of it and sat down facing the kitchen table. He looked at the newspaper in front of him with a headline in the sports section that caught his eye hours ago. BALBOA PROTEGE TO FIGHT? Of course the headline was in Russian and Ivan read through the column with sheer curiosity and he did so again. He put the paper down and looked ahead in deep thought. Getting up, Ivan decided to make a call. Rocky had just made his announcement to his family and already he was facing criticism from both of them. Adrian spoke. \"Rocky you can't do this just because this monster is forcing you. Don't you see? He wants you to do this.\" \"You think she'll be like Tommy? Is that what you're sayin'?\" he asked. \"Look Rocko, maybe you ain't the manager or trainer type you know?\" The words were a personal blow to Rocky and put his hands on his head as if to rip it off. He turned his back to them. He put his hands on the table thinking what to do. \"I ain't lettin' this guy take us down.\" he said looking back at them. \"Dad...\" Robert spoke and everyone looked at him. \"You think I shouldn't do this either do you?\" he looked at him. \"You have to do this.\" Everyone stood silent for almost a minute until the doorbell rang. \"That's her. Now remember...this is happening Adrian.\" Rocky eagerly went to the door and opened it with a smile but it faded immediately as he realized that it wasn't Jackie. It was the vile, George Washington Duke with a smirk on his face.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 A young woman walked slowly through a dirty, steel-decor corridor with her head bowed and scared that if looking up ahead might get her more criticism. She followed the sturdy security guard in front of her. She struggled to comprehend the events that lead her to where she was right now. It was a personal crime of her to do so because she had tried so hard to put her past behind her. But under the circumstances at the moment, she did not have much choice. She was about to go to the parole board and give them a detailed account of her life. A prison guard finally led her to an unknown room while he motioned in emphasis that he would remain inside. Jackie sat down silently and reluctantly in a chair in the middle of the room while three men seated themselves at the end of the small room. On the table was a list of documents. One of them looked at them carefully and sooner or later both of them took turns looking at that particular piece of paper. Jackie waited impatiently now. If the axe was to fall, then let it be done. \"Jacqueline Rambolina, age 26, female, nationality American, high school education only, a veteran from the military and only finished three years of college.\" The parole member droned on and Jackie did everything she could not to roll her eyes in disbelief. \"Charges include:\" Jackie heard everything now. \"Battery, Robbery, Domestic Disturbance and of course Assault in the second degree.\" The bald man with glasses said sternly. \"Ms. Rambolina…Is there a reason you chose to commit these crimes?\" The second man in the middle asked. Jackie remembered not to divulge any more information and can only explain vaguely. \"I have my reasons but mostly it was because there was no other alternative given to me. I was basically held up against a corner literally and figuratively. When you're in that position, your survival instinct kicks in. Basically I was…protecting myself in all of those instances. Am I to understand that a woman shouldn't defend herself?\" Jackie explained. \"Ms. Rambolina, the purpose of this hearing is for you to convince us whether or not you have actually changed. Up until a few months ago when your charges were not fully expressed, you remained non-violent, silent, and became a member of society again. But because of…George Washington Duke's latest plan for the city of Philadelphia, he has offered you a chance for, should you win it of course, freedom. Will you, Ms. Rambolina, be able to keep from performing illegal acts once we release you in Rocky Balboa's custody?\" \"Yes I would.\" \"Why do you believe that?\" asked the third member. \"Because it's like you said, I have Rocky.\" she simply said. \"I don't believe it.\" said Apollo appalled. \"He really did it for me.\" He shook his head and wiped tears from his eyes. Apollo was now armed with the information of the future. Months later, Rocky had challenged Ivan Drago and managed to defeat him. \"He truly is...a great man.\" He added despite the roaring crowd. Rocky was being hugged by Tony, Paulie and several spectators. Apollo wished he could be one of those few to touch him. \"He's somethin' alright.\" Mickey agreeing. He rubbed his eye to wipe a tear coming down his cheek. \"Now I know why I trained him, because he ain't scared of no pain.\" He said boldly. \"I wonder if he thought the same about me. I always knew how much he kind of resented me for teasing him before we ever even fought. I wonder if he knew how much he influenced me...changed me.\" \"Here's your answer kid.\" Mickey motioned to the ring where Rocky was making a speech. \"In this ring, there were...two people killing each other but that's better than two million. What I'm trying to say is...if I can change...and you can change...everyone can change!\" He declared and everyone cheered. \"Ain't that somethin?\" Apollo murmurred. He finally understood now. Rocky really was there for him and for that, he was beaming with pride. The scene instantly changed and both Mickey and Apollo found themselves in the empty ring from before. They both went in to discuss what they've seen. \"You knew all this beforehand?\" Apollo asked Mickey. \"Yeah...feels good seein' it again though. It was better to show you.\" \"So basically you like... tell the future. That was what happened. But how- what good will it do by showing me what Rocky's done?\" Apollo asked. \"Like I said, in a way...it's about helping 'im.\" Mickey simply said. \"Cuz' things got woise when he finished that fight.\" Apollo frowned. Rocky was livid in seeing Duke's face. He just wanted to cause him so much pain. Thought and reason left Rocky and the next thing he knew he charged at the man. He grabbed him by his collar and pushed him near the stairs at the corner. \"Now you know better than to put your hands on a superior boy! Put me down if you know what's good fo' you!\" Duke sneered. \"Why you doin' this huh?...HUH?\" Rocky shouted. \"You started a war you can't afford!\" Duke smiled. Rocky was about to raise his fist when a figure came out the door behind him. \"Rocky put him down!\" Adrian said coming outside now. \"Thank you!\" he said adjusting his collar. \"You're a monster. Don't you dare thank me! Now what are you doing here and what do you want?\" asked Adrian. With an over the top self-assurance, he answered. \"I came outta the goodness of my heart and because I felt so charitable today, I came to ask you...\" Duke turned to Rocky who was seething. \"for one last chance...Join me and we'll forget this whole thing.\" He grinned. Rocky stepped up to him and simply said with a growl. \"Take a hike.\" Duke only sneered. \"Well in a way, that's just good to hear cuz' it'll just make this whole thing better to enjoy. I mean...\" he chuckled in disbelief. \"What makes you think she can win?\" In two seconds of actual thinking, Rocky answered. \"She's got me.\" \"That's right.\" A figure said behind Duke. Rocky smiled in relief that it was Jackie with two police officers behind her. Duke turned around and said \"Hey...Jackie Rambolina, long time no see. You lookin' good. You lost weight right?\" he chuckled. \"And you gained some...right?\" she quipped. Duke laughed. \"Wow you're good.\" he said waving a finger at her. \"I came here to ask Rocky whether he should reconsider and join me and I guess he's still stubborn as a mule.\" \"Get out because I don't talk or deal with jackasses.\" she said. Duke put his hands in mock surrender. \"Fine.\" he said and walked towards the officers. \"Officers no need to inform you of Jackie's conditions to keep her parole on the up and up. You guys are doin' your jobs right?\" Duke raised an eyebrow to them. \"I don't like the girl either and we do know our jobs so please leave if this is not your property.\" one of the officers said strictly. \"Pleasure meeting you officer Boyt.\" he smiled and walked away to his limo. The officers went away after discussing with the Balboa's about Jackie's parole. Jackie was still outside looking at the Balboa's as they stood near the entrance to the house. \"He's a jerk.\" Rocky said smiling and agreeing with what Jackie was thinking. \"Yes he is. Yes he is.\" she nodded her head. \"Wanna come in now?\" \"It's not like I have a choice.\" Jackie said smirking as she was walking toward them. \"Thank you guys really.\" As she walked in there with Rocky and Adrian following her. Paulie scratched his head as he murmurred to himself. \"Rambolina...that's her last name?\" he asked incredulously. As Ivan Drago was seated in his plane, he was shaking his head. At the moment, he had no idea what he was about to do. Ivan was acting on instinct and decided to go to the one place that he needed to deal with some mental problems he was having. Most of them revolved around Rocky Balboa. He had to help him now.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 It was 7:00 in the morning. Inside a large building, three individuals looked around at the secluded gym they were in. Mickey's Gym. The building was dark and gloomy safe for a few lights still on. Rocky, Jackie and Paulie wondered aloud as to how they were going to begin. Both of them had their hands in their pockets apparently anxious as to how to resolve the situation they were currently in. \"People are complainin' about this man vs woman boxing thing.\" Paulie began. \"We got a fight coming up. How and where do we start?\" Jackie asked Rocky. \"We're going to need the big guns.\" Paulie said looking at Rocky. \"If you're thinking about Tony. He's unavailable. He's training somebody right now and can't commit.\" Rocky stated sadly. \"We need somebody with more experience in this. I don't want the same mistake to happen again.\" \"What do you mean?\" Jackie frowned. Rocky looked at her and hesitated. This was one of Rocky's biggest fears. The possibility that the same thing that happened with Tommy Gunn could happen to Jackie. He might lose her and she might reject him. After a long pause, Rocky finally answered \"I got this idea that…maybe I didn't too good with Tommy because I wasn't a good enough trainer. I wasn't there for him. He was led astray and I couldn't do nothing about him.\" \"He used ya Rock from the beginning! I keep telling you that kid wasn't no good!\" Paulie said outloud. \"I came from the same upbringing this punk did. Unlike him I still retain my beliefs and my morality. Those 'crimes' I committed, I only did them because dark forces made me. People who took away my hope and my dignity. It was the only way I could get them back. Tommy Gunn probably had the same thing done to him. His own hope and pride was lost and he did nothing about it. That's...the difference between me and him.\" Jackie said. \"You have to believe me.\" she added with tears in her eyes. Rocky gave a warm smile and because of what Jackie said that he finally got an idea. \"No woman in boxing history has ever had much of a place in the boxing world, much less fight a man who is superior to her. How can George Washington Duke pull something like this off?\" an ESPN commentator spoke. \"That remains to be said. But still the entire country is going ape over this upcoming match between the disgraced Tommy Gunn and a rookie female fighter Jackie Rambolina.\" another ESPN commentator replied. In an airport, a crowd of people looked at the TVs stationed near the terminal. A member of the crowd stood out as he watched what the men were saying on the screen. The gigantic behemoth looked on with eager interest. He looked around though to make sure people didn't recognize him. He pulled his cap down and put his sunglasses on, then he left. Arriving in Philadelphia was a strange experience for Ivan Drago, immediately he began to feel culture shock within an instant. He looked around as cars honked, strange posters littering the sidewalk, music blaring, and buildings that had an odd decor. Ivan was in a taxi cab for the first time and already he was beginning to feel overwhelmed by what America had. He began to get pensive as to how to deal with what was to come, unaware that the driver was watching him. \"Hey you look familiar. Have I seen you before?\" the taxi driver asked him with a hint of excitement as if he actually did know who he was. Ivan coughed and responded with a crude American accent that sounded too high pitched. \"Nah, actually this is my first time here. I'm from LA.\" \"Oh never mind then sorry buddy.\" Ivan nodded absentmindedly and looked back out the window. As he continue to watch the new world he was in, he caught a glimpse of several men fighting in a random alleyway right next to a bank. As the car sped, Ivan could not imagine how he, could do what happened next. As soon as they left Mickey's Gym, Rocky, Paulie and Jackie were a bit excited as to what they will finally do. The idea was for Jackie to train at a women's boxing gym that Rocky found. He was amazed he didn't think of it sooner. \"I didn't know why I didn't thought of it until just now, you know?\" he chuckled. \"Well at least we finally got a plan.\" Jackie said happily. \"Yo Rock get a look at this!\" Paulie grumbled and pointed his head forward. Several spectators soon followed Rocky's gaze. Witnesses screamed as to what was happening. Rocky saw two men making their way out of a bank with bags of money under their armpits and guns in their hands. One of them called out as they came down the stairs \"Where's LaVonne?\" \"He went out the back just forget him and go!\" his partner cried out. Both thieves went off despite people looking. Rocky could not believe what was happening and his anxiousness turned to anger. Paulie wondered how this was happening as he said \"All this in broad daylight?\" Rocky saw how Jackie ran towards the situation. \"Hey wait don't!\" Rocky went after her. \"Aw geez not again!\" Paulie ran as well throwing his cigar away. An armed assailant with a black ski mask on was brutally beating a security guard with his bare hands. As he took a gun out and prepared to pull the trigger, he felt like his breath left him. He couldn't breathe. A great hand pressed against his throat from behind. The assailant dropped his gun and tried to get the humongous hand off him but couldn't pry it off and the next thing he knew, was total blackness. He was knocked out cold. The security guard laying on the ground, began to pant harder when he saw his rescuer: Ivan Drago. \"There would have to be another party involved.\" Ivan frowned. \"He could not rob a bank by hisself.\" He told the security guard. Ivan Drago hated thieves, people who would not bother making a life for their own and had to resort to stealing then working hard. \"Two other men. They uh...went out the front.\" The guard said as he nodded. He couldn't take his eyes off Drago. Ivan looked ahead and nodded. He began to follow suit. But the guard pressed on. \"Hey I'm badly hurt. I need help.\" \"Call 911!\" Ivan shrugged as he ran leaving a frustrated guard behind. He went out the front of the bank but found no one and looked around to find out which direction they went. \"All I saw was two men coming out and going towards that direction...\" Ivan looked to a witness telling a police officer what happened. He looked to where she was looking as she was explaining what had happened and Ivan immediately ran, despite police vehicles already going that direction as well. He followed them instead keeping his distance. Eventually they stopped and saw the place in which the bank robbers had settled in. A women's gym. Ivan heard the list of demands coming from one of the bank robbers. \"I want a chopper on the roof now or else I start shooting!\" He yelled at one of the police officers twenty feet away. \"How many hostages?\" the police officer asked through his bullhorn. \"Twenty or thirty women and wouldn't you know it? Rocky Balboa and his pal!\" He growled. \"He's there!\" Ivan murmurred softly.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 In what seemed to be an impressive short amount of time, a hostage situation had occurred. The women's gym was taken over by two heavily armed hooded individuals whom wasted no time taking over the place to gain an advantage over the police. Rocky, for the first time came up with what would make these guys steal a bank and then take a women's gym under their control? He then remembered that he saw a newspaper article down the street a few hours before he, Paulie and Jackie made their way to Mickey's Gym in pursuit of the lowlifes. The headline read: \"Crime Rate Escalates.\" Rocky knew it to be the cause of George Washington Duke. Of course, he was the kind of man who would pay no attention to the economy of a city much less for what people make on a weekly basis. Rocky supposed correctly that so far George Washington Duke was a negative effect, a virus on the city of Philadelphia. No jobs, no money thus, crime becomes too apparent. He shook his head thinking this and went back to reality where the two hoodlums were finished making their demands to the police outside. Rocky could not help but recognize one of the robbers' voices. It sounded familiar. \"Everybody shoosh and shush! We don't want hurt nobody but we will if we got to!\" the robber had said and members of the gym which composed entirely of female stood with their backs to the wall including Rocky, Paulie and Jackie. One by one their wrists were tied together with cord. The women were frightened and several were crying. \"We got the place wired with explosives that will make this place a crater if one of you ladies and gents get out of line!\" shouted the menacing hoodlum. Everyone cowered in fear at what was just being said. Rocky shook his head as if wanting to say 'yeah, it's worse.' \"Well, Well, Well...\" one of the bank robbers said as he slowly approached Rocky apparently getting a good look at him. \"Who do we have here?\" Rocky wanted to speak but the thief cut him with a jab to his gut. He coughed. The punch was unexpected and he fell to the ground. Rocky hissed in pain. The other bank robber held his arms in case he wanted to attack. He was led into the gym arena which was in the middle of the room they were in. Rocky struggled as he was being dragged towards it. \"Don't! Leave him alone!\" Jackie screamed. But it was too late and Rocky was to another room. As soon as he was tossed by the two criminals through the ropes. The masked hoodlum stood in the middle of the ring and looked down at Rocky.\"Look after them. I'mma go deal with him.\" Soon the accomplice went off with a nod. \"Rocky Balboa...\" He finished and placed a hand on his chin. \"What? You don't know who I am?\" the robber then took his mask off. Astonishment overwhelmed Rocky as he saw the robber revealed at last. He was big, black and burly. Baldness showed on the hoodlum's left and right side of his head. He was unshaven on his chin and sideburns. What made him more recognizable was the gaze he gave Rocky. It was Clubber Lang who sported an evil grin at Rocky. Blue and white light was the glow that gave off everywhere in the place they were. Apollo was used to it now and it disappeared as he finally materialized towards an unknown area where loads of people were stationed to give questions to what seemed to Apollo, three or four people on seated on stage. The press conference was already in effect. Mickey was right next to him. Before they were transported, Mickey had already told Apollo that Rocky gave up everything and was back to where he started. There was a protegé of Rocky that was getting to be a problem. Apollo listened as to what was going on. A newspaper editor called out to the young fighter. \"Do you think it was too easy?\" The young man responded quickly as if he was on top of the world. \"I took some shots, but I was never hurt. I'm just glad to be the champ!\" He shook the heavyweight championship belt in the air. Another member of the media called out. \"Don't you think this looked like more like a sparring session than a championship?\" Apollo looked on as Tommy Gunn was becoming infuriated over the questions the reporters were giving him which he naturally assumed were insults. Apollo thought hard as he looked at the young fighter. He nodded in understanding. Apollo had met and dealt with people who were tempted by money and greed. He himself almost did. In a way, Tommy was a lot like Apollo. \"I know how this is gonna turn out.\" Apollo said unexpectedly. \"Whadaya mean?\" Mickey asked. \"It's like you said, Rocky lost his fortune and trained a young fighter but betrayed him in the long run. My question is...why are you showing me all of this?\" He waved a hand emphasizing his point. \"How can we possibly help him if we're...\" \"Well...Rocky is special, like I said. That doesn't mean that he a'int thinking about us. We're seeing all this because it kinda gives us clues as to what's happened to him and how we can help him.\" Mickey said. Apollo looked on with confusion and shook his head as he still didn't quite understand. \"I'm just sayin' we're irrelevant. Even if we did have all this information how exactly do we help Rock?\" \"A man can dream can't he?\" Mickey grinned. Apollo now looked more confused with that response. Ivan Drago, quick for a man so tall wasted no time in trying to intervene so that he stop the current predicament. If Rocky died, he would never get the chance to do what he needed to in order to regain some closure in his life. He made his way to the back of the building. Avoiding the police was no problem as he took another route instead. As he went around, he took the long way to avoid the police and crowd and made his way to the back of the building. There were two squad cars in the back position. Only two police officers were stationed with their guns drawn out waiting for any order from their commanding officer. Ivan Drago knocked them out from behind. As the policemen laid down on the floor, Ivan took the chance to get in through the back door. Rocky was still being brutally beaten by Clubber Lang and the worst part about it was that he couldn't get free to defend himself. \"You took away my belt, now I'ma take away your life and for that...I pity you fool!\" He gave him another cross to his chin. Rocky was close to getting knocked out cold. But what he nor Lang realized was that Jackie standing across the wall in the other room with the other women, was close to freeing herself. Cutting the cord with a small knife she had always carried around with. Jackie looked at the robber with hatred and contempt. He was looking at the other room where the sounds of punching and hitting were occurring. Jackie knew he was distracted and she was close to finally cutting the last thread of the cord she was bound with. \"What are you doin?\" Paulie mouthed silently. Jackie simply winked at him. The SWAT team had just arrived and as protocol needed to make sure all standard police teams were in perfect communication order. However, there was a team in the back that was left non-responsive. \"Sir, we lost communication with the officers in the back.\" an officer outside reported to his commanding lieutenant. The lieutenant cursed under his breath. He was now assuming the worst. \"Must have shot them! We have no choice. Tell them if they do not release the hostages in five minutes, we'll go in by force. No negotiation.\" he said. The lead officer nodded and then hurried back to the rest of his comrades to issue the order. Ivan Drago made his way in what seemed like a basement judging by the dark decor. He had heard commotion coming from above and because he did, he had to make his way quickly and cautiously. Drago eagerly wanted to see what was happening. Making his way up the stairs where a door was shown above, Drago made his way toward it. As he got to it, he turned the doorknob only to find it lock. He swore in his mind. If he opened it by force, the thieves will hear it. He paused to decide what course of action he should take despite the noise he was hearing on the other side. Rocky was dealt with by a hard blow to his jaw. \"You're a disgrace.\" He spat out softly. \"Whatchu say?\" Lang picked him roughly by the collar so that they were face to face. \"You got lucky last time but you ain't gon' be so lucky now!\" He then headbutted Rocky and it was that hit that finally knocked him out cold. Yet he could hear Lang mocking him. \"He down ladies and gents! 1... \" 2 ...\" Rocky had his eyes closed for exactly those two seconds. It was then that he finally opened them that he realized that he was in a different setting than where he was. He was in an empty ring surrounded by blue and white light along with a lot of fog passing by. He got up and as he stood he realized he was no longer bound as he stared at his hands. \" 3 ...\" Lang's voice was still heard. After a few moments, he turned around and saw a figure making his way toward him. The man was in the other corner. He finally materialized as he stepped forward. \"Who is that? What do you want?\" he cried. \"Just an old sparring buddy.\" It was Apollo creed. \" 4 ...\" Rocky paid no attention to Lang's voice and instead stood in mesmerization at Apollo. \"How?\" he finally spoke. \"No time to explain all I can say is you need to get your head back in the game. I know how it turned out for you but like I told you before one time...it ain't ever over.\" \" 5 ...\" \"I'm sorry for what happened to you Apollo.\" Rocky said with tears in his eyes. \"You shouldn't be man. You got another chance at this and you don't even see it.\" Apollo said. \" 6 ...\" \"Chance for what?\" \"To be a great and yet...good person.\" \" 7 ...\" \"I feel like I can't no more, you know?\" \" 8 ...\" \"That depends on you...you got two seconds what do you want to do?\" Apollo asked with a smile. \" 9 ...\" \"It was great seeing you.\" Rocky smiled. \"Likewise.\" Everything dematerialized all of a sudden and Rocky finally had his eyes opened. But what he saw was unbelievable. It was Ivan Drago and Clubber going at it in the ring![Chapter 11] Chapter 11 Apollo came out of a strange zone, a zone that allowed him to stand on the boundary between life and death. He felt great all of a sudden. It was evident by the smile on his face. It soon turned into a grin. As he walked in a random void, he saw Mickey standing in front of him. He nodded in understanding. \"We can still help him. Come on!\" Mickey waved an arm to Apollo to hurry along and soon both of them were watching another scenery. Apollo knew the plan was to help Rocky and he didn't want to stop helping him. He wanted to continue him. For that, Apollo continued to smile for the fact that in life or in death, he can still make a difference. Rocky had opened his eyes in great surprise to see two of his former combatants taking swings at each other. He saw how Ivan Drago attempted to pummel Clubber Lang. All of this happened in a ring which was the funny thing. Just when I thought it couldn't get any weirder thought Rocky. Still in pain, he attempted to adjust his position to get a better view. Clubber Lang started to control the fight by launching several of his hard-hitting swings to Ivan's face. Each hit seemed to stun Drago. He staggered backward to the pole where Lang pummeled him repeatedly in his chest. He then attempted to launch another hit to Drago's face. Surprisingly he ducked out of the way, where Drago got out from the corner, launched a jab to Lang's abdomen causing him to keel over and with a yell, Drago gave him a massive uppercut to Lang that sent him flying across the ring. Spitting out blood, Lang got up and tackled Ivan where he hit him wildly like an animal. It was then that Rocky wished he could get loose to give Drago a chance. Rocky knew Ivan was probably here for a grudge as well but he wasn't finished with Lang and if that meant joining a former adversary to take him down, so be it. He thought. Finally free from her bindings, Jackie motioned to the robber in front of her. \"Hey! For a robber, you sure got your dignity stolen huh?\" Women gasped at her response and Paulie just shook his head in regret. \"You got something you wanna say?\" The robber started on Jackie when she then kicked him in the kneecap. As he fell, he shot off a round in the ceiling on reflex, Jackie's bindings burst opened and she began to launch a brutal assault on the criminal. Using what seemed like lightning fast speed, she spun and elbowed him in the face followed by a hard blow across the robber's face. Paulie can tell the women were shocked at the attack Jackie was launching. Paulie murmurred to one of them. \"I taught her everything she knows.\" \"Shots fired!\" one of the commanding officers replied to one of his superiors on his phone. \"Forget the negotiator. We're going in!\" The commanding officer motioned to his Captain whom grabbed a bullhorn and was about to give orders to the SWAT team in front of the building, many of them holding their rifles and pointing them toward the entrance of the building. \"Hold that fire!\" The commanding officer looked flabbergasted at that response. \"Sir we have a shot fired!\" he said exasperated. \"No scream, no perps coming out telling us what happened, no call, we don't know what caused that. Five minutes. Inform the Lieutenant.\" \"Keep the people back!\" A frustrated lieutenant standing right next to him shouted to one of the officers keeping the increasing crowd in check. A junior officer did his best to keep the crowd calm. \"Ma'am I'm going to need you and everyone else to move back.\" He ordered. \"We heard on the news Rocky's in there! We're here to help him! Isn't that right guys?\" The whole crowd answered her question by saying \"Rocky! Rocky!\" over and over again. The junior officer looked at his captain with a deflated look on his face apparently signaling that control is almost impossible. Nicky Richards, a reporter for channel 9 couldn't help but see a certain window in front of the building. He saw a two figures in what looked to be a ring far inside. \"Hey check that out!\" he whispered to his partner. \"Oh my God!\" \"I know, right?\" \"Do you think we're the only ones seeing this?\" Always a man who lived dangerously, Nicky motioned to his assistant. \"Grab the camera and we'll see soon enough.\" They both attempted to get closer despite the growing mob. The thief now had various moves that matched Jackie's and both were in what seemed to everyone sitting around them, as a fierce dance. Jackie was getting more than frustrated at the criminal. She was giving everything and as much as she launched a few blows, they were blocked. She hated being inferior than a man. Her speed was more than consistent but her strength was still at an average level. Wanting to end this quickly, she kneed him in the groin area making him go down in an instant. Immediately, she began to tie him up both his feet binded as well as his hands. \"Whatcha waitin for? Rock's in trouble!\" Paulie cried reminding her. Apparently she did forget and went off quickly in search for him. \"You coulda untied me too.\" murmurred Paulie as he struggled to get free as well. A ferocious Clubber Lang continued to have the upper hand in the fight. He was on top of him hitting him with Drago putting up his fists to protect his face. Rocky saw this and continued to struggle against his bindings. He needed to get away from the fight. He had second thoughts and was brought to the conclusion that Drago could not possibly accept his help. Knowing both these men, one of them could still commence attack on him. Rocky's thoughts were soon emptied as he saw Lang take out a gun from his back pocket and pointing it at Drago's face. \"You shoulda not have climbed down from the beanstalk, fool!\" Lang taunted and was about to pull the trigger. It was then that he saw an unexpected sight. Jackie was on top of the turn buckle crouching and looked ready to jump. Rocky cried out. \"What are you-?\" She then jumped and landed on Lang with incredible force, knocking the gun off his hand which slid on the ring floor and out of sight. \"Jackie!\" She got off Clubber Lang's back and as she took off her jacket, Jackie stood in a fighting position. Lang frowned at the newcomer. \"You serious? You want some of this?\" he yelled. He then sent a hit that could have made a hole in a concrete wall. Jackie blocked the punch amazingly using her jacket wrapping his wrist and bringing him face to face with him. Both of them grit their teeth. Soon, Jackie fell down with her jacket sprawled on the side. It was then that Jackie's knife fell out of the pocket and landed near Drago's body. \"NO!\" Rocky saw Jackie and trouble and tried to get loose. Ivan Drago saw the scene in which the young woman was getting subdued and then he looked at Rocky. The knife next to him suggested that the opportunity he was looking for was finally within reach. He grabbed it and very slowly crawled towards Rocky. Rocky then saw Ivan approaching him with a knife. In fear, he struggled to get free. \"I need to save her!\" he yelled at him. Surprisingly, Drago turned a scared Rocky Balboa around and attempted to cut the rope that tied his hands together. Nicky Richards had found a way around the building without being seen by the police. His assistant holding the camera followed him inside the building. \"We have to be extremely quiet, like we're not here. OK, Riley?\" They were walking up a set of stairs that led to the main floor. \"Got it. This is some predicament.\" he whispered. \"Heck of a way to help, isn't it?\" Nicky winked to Riley. Sneaking their way into a hostage filled area, Nicky and Riley were determined to make themselves notorious in news-making history. They found themselves facing a door and after hearing sounds of struggle inside, Nicky opened the door slowly. As the door swung opened, they found themselves facing a ring with several individuals including Rocky in it. \"You getting this?\" Nicky asked Riley. \"Already am!\" he whispered back. Riley marveled at what he personally referred to as an 'epic' sight. With his hands freed, Rocky with eyes that signalled intense hatred and confidence, got up and turned to face Lang on the ground about to hit Jackie. It would be a blow that could end her. Rocky clenched his fists so hard, they shook. Rocky wasted no time and grabbing Lang's wrist that was in the air. Lang turned to face Rocky with a growl but Rocky just hit him hard in the face. Lang fell backwards which gave Rocky enough time to go to Jackie. \"Jackie, you OK?\" \"Yeah.\" she nodded still on the ground. \"Free the others.\" Jackie got out of the ring but not before she took a curious glance toward Drago who was on the ground rubbing his forehead, apparently still seeing stars. She didn't know why but felt as if she had to help him. He did take a severe beating. Nicky Richards was documenting the incredible sight without being seen. So far, he was explaining in rapid whisper to the general public in full detail what was happening. \"As you can see, Rocky Balboa, the two time former heavyweight champion is doing whatever it takes to incapacitate what looks to be Clubber Lang. A young woman who fits the description of Jackie Rambolina, a former criminal herself helping Rocky. This is truly a spectacular sight.\" \"Come on Rocky fight this guy hard!\" whispered Riley. \"This is all over the world now, Mr. Duke. This fight you initiated was almost impossible and yet however you achieved it financially, there are many who claim that the underdog, a Jackie Rambolina will not be able to handle a fighter like Tommy Gunn. Hence the fight is still not that popular enough nor interesting to the spectators as we've seen from the polls.\" George Washington Duke wished he could agree with what the interviewer was saying but he had to keep people interested and it was something he knew well enough to do. \"I told you all and everyone else, and I still say, simply, it's time for something new.\" \"Excuse me Mr. Duke, we seemed to be getting something new as well for we are cutting to a video feed of a hostage situation in downtown Philadelphia where a Rocky Balboa and Jackie Rambolina are engaging a fight with a former boxing fighter Clubber Lang.\" Duke turned his head over in surprise and saw on a monitor everything that was happening. \"Only in America.\" he said simply.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 The whole footage spread out through the country so fast, it was practically on every news channel. But more primarily, the sports media was taking it more seriously. The footage contained Rocky, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago, and Jackie Rambolina fighting in a gym ring. Nobody can ascertain how the footage was being shot for the fact that the gym was being taken over by now-turned criminal Clubber Lang and an unknown accomplice. Nobody else can ascertain as to how Rocky Balboa's former opponents came to town. There were many questions that came with no answers. Everybody on TV was very perplexed. One thing was for certain however, everybody was cheering in every vicinity in Philadelphia for Rocky and Jackie to win against their captors. The police refused to comment and speculate with news reporters. Nobody with a high authority was sure what was going on. They simply waited. The funny thing was that everyone had the same scenario, the same dramatic ending that included somebody walking out the door the victor, the heroes or the villain. In a practice ring, Rocky had shown that he still retained his speed and stamina given to him from Apollo Creed's training a few years ago. Jackie and Rocky each gave Lang serious blows to every part of his body. Rocky can tell just as well as Jackie that Lang was weakening, he was indeed getting tired. Eventually Clubber Lang went down hard when Jackie launched an impressive kick to his head. Rocky smiled at her. He was impressed and couldn't find a way to explain it to her. She smiled back. Rocky frowned a bit at the way she smiled. It was as if an angel would smile, he thought to himself. The moment was over as a loud sound occurred. Jackie looked and saw a hole in her left shoulder. She then went down. \"NO!\" Rocky cried. Nicky taking a peak from the basement door which was open ajar, felt as if someone pushed him in and knew it wasn't his assistant was as if he had lost control of his actions because the next thing he knew, he was crouching and made his way into the gym where he saw Drago beaten on the floor and looking over to his left, Nicky went to a sporting equipment section at the corner of the room. He made his way back with an object in his hands. He threw the object beside Drago, whom had his eyes closed the whole time. Clubber Lang reappeared and pointed his gun at Rocky. Giving him a bloody grin, he said. \"You're turn, fool!\" he cocked the gun. Suddenly a flat, blunt object struck Lang's head from behind. He went down instantly. Ivan Drago, still beaten from his fight with Clubber Lang held a baseball bat from the gym, was in a daze. In fatigue, Drago sat down in the corner post, letting go of the bat in the process. Rocky cradled Jackie in his arms immediately as he went to her side. Jackie was panting hard but she looked up at Rocky nevertheless. \"I wanted to help. I wanted to prove to you I was strong to begin with. Did I do it? Did I do it?\" she asked softly with tears in her eyes. \"Yeah you did it. You got him. You saved all of us...\" \"I don't want to go yet. I want to help you take back the city.\" \"You will. You will. Just hang in there. You're going to be alright, kid.\" All of a sudden, the door to the club burst open as several police officers including a SWAT team made their way in, securing the area. A few secured the hostages and removed their bindings. A SWAT Team member cuffed the accomplice while the lieutenant and captain made their way to the ring area with both frowns shown on their faces. They were trying to make out what they saw. Eventually the captain climbed in the ring including a few paramedics that he ordered in. Rocky looked back to Jackie who now had her eyes closed. He shook her, trying to wake her up but couldn't. \"Jackie! JACKIE!\" he cried. He then hugged her tightly. \"Mr. Balboa, what happened here?\" the captain said with his arms stretched, showing his frustration and confusion. Rocky felt like all speech was taken away from him. He did not know what to say. It was then that Nicky and Riley made their way to the gym as soon as they finally see the robbers subdued. Nicky was about to give his report on what happened but before he could even start, two police officers came up and questioned them. \"What were you two thinking going in by yourselves?\" the officer told them outrageously. The reporter shook his head, unable to answer the question properly.\"I don't know...I guess it was one of those out-of-body experiences.\" Nicky frowned as the question did seemingly confuse him. Why did he go in? Paulie made his way toward Rocky in the ring, albeit he struggled but eventually got in. Rocky kneeled in front of Jackie while the paramedics were taking care of her. \"Yo, Rocko what happened to her?\" \"She got shot, Paulie.\" Rocky muttered miserably. \"How?\" Rocky merely stood silent and found that talking was something he wasn't looking forward to right now. Drago saw the whole thing. Rocky was crying to the young woman he had in his arms. Ivan knew better than to get involved with other people's affairs but he could not get the feeling in the pit of his stomach that made him want to be sad himself. Emotion was something that was foreign to him. In the end, Ivan thought to himself. What was the real reason for coming here? Seeing how Rocky took no notice of him, he got up and left. He had no choice but to talk to the police. Apparently interfering with a crime was also questionable to the police. So he gave his story to the only reporter available in the room. He said his name was Nicky. Drago felt it was the right thing to do. It was closest to closure as he could get. He needed the hole inside of him patched up. Giving his account of what happened and why he wanted to help would only fill up the empty hole to a minimal extent but he also knew a way of making himself feel better in the long run. After a few hours of talking to the press and the police, Ivan Drago left to initiate a plan. One thing that he made sure was glued to everyone's mind was what Drago had said to the screen as he was being interviewed. \"I'm not a monster anymore.\" \"So now that this girl is out of commission, what's going to happen to us?\" Tommy Gunn asked. In an office somewhere in the Philadelphia Town Hall, a black middle-aged man sat across a table with Tommy standing by. George Washington Duke was wearing a bemused smile on his face. He had heard what happened. \"What's going to happen to you is in question. I, however, have taken it upon myself to see that this is one step closer to getting what I want.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Ignoring him, Duke went on. \"I was hoping something like this would happen. This is why I'm always telling myself that I'm the greatest promoter of all time and If this girl doesn't make it, we get it all!\" he grinned. \"You mean if she dies?\" Tommy asked. \"What do you think?\" Duke gave a half-smile. \"Will she make it?\" \"She's in a coma, Adrian.\" Rocky then sat down at the table. He looked heavily distressed. Rocky felt as if she let Jackie down. He was supposed to have saved her. Does this mean everyone I try and help when it comes to fighting always leaves me because of something? He asked himself this question. Adrian knew exactly what he was thinking and sat down next to him. \"You know for a time now, I thought, she might become like Tommy Gunn and get obsessed with fame and fortune. I worried then. But after getting to know her, she's truly radiant and pure of heart in a sense. I think maybe she's the one. Your true student and she, in turn, would help you become the best trainer there ever was, even better than Mickey or Apollo.\" \"I ain't like Mickey or Apollo, Adrian.\" Rocky moaned with tears in his eyes. \"Yes you are. You have the best from both of them. They've helped you and in a way they will help Jackie. I know what you're thinking too. Robert will always know everything about you, your goodness and your spirit. You'll always have that to pass onto him. This woman deserves that too. She's earned it.\" Adrian then put a hand on top of Rocky's. He then nodded in understanding. Paulie then came in looking serious. \"Hey uh…things still ain't takin a turn for the good, Roc.\" \"What do you mean, Paulie?\" \"That Duke guy just heard about Jackie's condition and uh…he's using this as an excuse to say that he's more than close to having the city in his pocket now. It's all over the news, Rocko.\" Rocky then banged his fists on the table in anger. He then shook his head. \"Why is this happening?\" he asked gritting his teeth. \"I have told him over and over again, that he ain't gettin' me. I ain't winning this fight guys. This is bigger than anything that I ever faced.\" Robert then came in and stood right next to Paulie. \"Uhh...dad?\" \"Hey how you doin'?\" Rocky greeted his son almost absentmindedly. \"You got a visitor at the door.\" he said almost as if he was in disbelief at who he just saw. \"Who is it?\" He heard footsteps approaching slowly. Through the living room, Rocky could make out an extremely tall figure almost consumed by the night from outside coming in. Rocky couldn't believe it when the giant man walked into the kitchen. Jackie felt like she was spinning. She had no control over it. All she could do was close her eyes shut. ' Where am I? What's happening?\" She stopped asking herself these questions. She knew nobody would answer her. Whatever was happening to her, she knew that she was never going to resolve it if her eyes were closed. She knew that. Jackie then opened her eyes. A bright light was then shown to her. She squinted and frowned. Is this Heaven? Jackie looked to her left and right. She was in a ring but completely different from the one she qas previously in moments ago. She eventually sat up and surveyed her surroundings. \"I guess you can say this is the 'waiting area.' a voice answered her thought. Jackie frowned at the response. She did not know to whom it belong to. \"Who's there?\" Jackie could only make out thick fog in front of her but a silhouette of a man walked forward to her. She was perplexed at the person emerging. \"Just a friend with a common interest.\" Apollo Creed appeared in front of Jackie. He gave her a welcoming smile.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 A pair of Nike sneakers made their way through an intensely clean floor. The hospital was always a place where the concept of worry grew exponentially. Through the corridor, the young figure tried to make his way to a certain room. The receptionist had already told him when he came in that visiting hours were almost over so he had to make it quick. As he went left through another corridor where an arrow pointing the direction had the words INTENSIVE CARE, the figure marched on without hesitation. He knew that the doctors had already taken the bullet out of her. However, Jackie Rambolina was not out of the woods yet. Everywhere he looked he saw people in rooms where the only thing keeping them alive were machines that could malfunction at any time. The figure shook his head and walked on regardless of what he saw. Finally he came to the last door on the right. He looked at the room number and it was indeed the one the receptionist told him. Breathing in and out, the figure slowly opened the door. He took his time to survey her. The young woman, Jackie was laying on the bed connected to a machine, unmoving. She is the fallen angel, he thought. Her beautiful face unknowing and yet docile, her closed eyes gave her the impression that she was taking a deep sleep. The young figure then made his way over to her side. He then sat down to her right side. Trying so hard to avoid the beeping coming from the heart monitor, he began to speak. \"Hi.\" he simply said and knew it was a feeble introduction but he went on. \"I heard about what happened to you. I'm sorry you got shot.\" He began to cry but stopped himself and did the best he could to continue. \"You're the only true friend I've had. You-You're strong for a girl. You can't give up. You can't. I uh…know you can't hear me. But I like to believe that maybe you do even if you don't, you know and I just want you to know something, you may have suffered more than any other person out there…but you will succeed more than other person. I know that….because my dad knows that.\" Robert said. Jackie could only further show her unmoving, sleeping state in response. Whiskey bottles and beer littered the bartender's wall as Rocky looked at the mirror across from him. For the past two days, he was unshaven and depressed. Rocky had not seen Jackie two days since she was shot. He knew seeing her would only make his depression worse. Instead he waited for a call from her doctor explaining any change in her condition. Rocky had been coming to Andy's Bar ever since and what the patrons in the bar could not figure out was why he had not ordered anything any alcohol. Nobody had spoken to Rocky, apparently he looked like he needed to be alone. Even Andy knew, he had a lot on his plate. Rocky had been a great fighter before. But a head injury prevented him from ever stepping into the ring again. He considered whether he should be taking on Tommy himself. Being a trainer now was not what he expected. Mickey, Apollo and Duke made it look so easy. He wanted so much to be an inspiration to everybody. So why wasn't he capable of guiding someone toward the right path? Why was everybody he ever came into contact defected? Rocky came to the conclusion that he had hit rock bottom this time and there was no way out of it. Rocky heard the door open behind him but did not bother turning around. Heavy footsteps made their way toward him accompanied by soft murmurrs from the patrons. Rocky could instantly tell who he was but right now, he was not in the mood to talk. The footsteps then grew louder and stopped when the tall figure was right behind him. Two days ago, Rocky received a weird visit from Ivan Drago, the man who killed his friend, Apollo Creed. What Drago offered to Rocky was something totally unexpected. With his strange accent, Drago spoke behind him quietly. \"Are you finally willing to make a decision this time? And I'm not talking about the drink.\" he said. Agitated, Rocky responded to him without turning around. \"I just want to be left alone.\" Ivan went to Rocky's side but did not sit on the stool. Instead he leaned with his back on the bar. \"Do you want to know why I came back?\" he asked facing him. Rocky sighed. \"Why?\" \"Because we have unfinished business...\" Drago said. \"Really? So why don't we go back in the alley then?\" \"I know you are still mad over the loss of Apollo. I can only destroy, I cannot bring him back to life. But...\" he trailed off before he continued. \"Ever since you defeated me...I have become changed. At first I was angry that I was defeated for the first time but I realized it made me a better man now. I saw what my people were trying to make me out to be. Seeing you now, makes me angry, very angry indeed. You changed for the worst, Rocky Balboa. If you really meant what you said in your speech that day, you would be by that girl's side now.\" He then stepped off the stool section and gave a look to Rocky from his left side now. \"You have until tonight and it may be the moment when you will reconsider about what I have said.\" Ivan then turned around and left leaving a group of spectators speechless. Rocky now deep in thought considered the possibility of taking his offer. If Jackie comes out of her coma, she will indeed need an intermediary that will help her win the fight against Tommy. Rocky couldn't do everything himself so he knew it was time to get all the help he could get. Jackie wondered, perhaps out loud if this was an illusion within her mind. A world that unexpectedly was developed through imagination. Her subconscious must have been heavily influenced by the shot in the chest. It was enough to cause trauma. Why else would she be talking to one of Rocky's rivals? \"You're Apollo Creed.\" Jackie frowned. \"That's right.\" he nodded warmly. \"Obviously I'm having some side effects from the anesthesia.\" Jackie spoke out loud. \"I've never even met you before in my life. Rocky did. Maybe something he told me about you manifested into this or maybe the doctors must have put me under. I must be hallucinating.\" \"If that's what you want to believe, I won't stop you. But just because reality is based on rules, those rules can be broken from time to time. In other words, reality can become more than fantasy.\" \"I'm not following you.\" Jackie shook her head. \"It uh..sounds rather vague to me.\" \"Believe me that's what I thought at first when I arrived here. This...\" Apollo looked above at the stadium ceiling with lights all around. \"is a place where fighters with heart feel they need to do something first before they go on.\" \"'Go on'? What do you mean? Am I dead?\" she asked. \"Hey...\" Apollo said trying to calm him down. \"This is just a waiting area. I came to tell you to keep on fighting, sweetheart.\" \"You-You talk as if you know me...\" \"You have Rocky's spirit. You're pure of heart, strong, and not afraid to stand up for yourself. So you tell me? Do you have a reason to keep on living?\" \"What kind of question is that?\" \"It's the answer that will get you out.\" Apollo said. \"Well...\" Jackie seriously now didn't know how to answer that question. She shook her head and turned away from Apollo as she found herself contemplating. Jackie knew was a woman who was different than all the rest of the women out there. Her life had been one of pure shambles and despair. Suffering was what she was used to. Everyday she prayed for it to stop. When she continued to go down a dark path, she took what she could get. She even murdered. With everything she had done and experienced, maybe she didn't deserve to go back. Jack Johnson of channel 11 news cleared his throat about what he was about to present next. The man about to speak was hated throughout the state. Jack could barely keep his anger to a minimum but he tried his best. \"We now cut to a live interview with the soon-to-be owner of Philadelphia, George Washington Duke.\" Another video was shown with Duke giving a toothy grin. \"Hello, city of brotherly love. I have come to deliver a message to each and every one of you. I understand some of you think of me as shady and...evil as some of you may think. But did it ever occurred to you all, that I could save this city from crime and poverty as it is so plagued at this very moment?\" Duke then raised his arms in a hugging position. \"Come on, Philly! Don't do me like this! Don't judge me if you don't know me!\" he joked and then gave a hearty laugh. \"Look Philly, Jackie Rambolina suffered an unfortunate accident. I know, I know, poor girl, city like this. But even I know she is in no condition to fight Tommy Gunn. She has been incapacitated for over 48 hours and of course she ain't woken up. I think she may be scared and may feel she really is not up to face Tommy Gunn at all. Jackie may be a smart girl after all. If she still wants to fight, then I want an answer! Is she dead or is she chicken?\" The television was then turned off. The nurse looked down at Robert, looking upset at what Duke just said. \"Visiting hours are over, young man.\" \"You heard what he said! You guys need to save her!\" Robert declared. \"We are doing everything we can. Now you need to head on home. There's a storm coming. Your parents must be worried sick.\" the nurse then left. Robert took no heed to what the nurse said and turned the television back on as soon as she was out of sight. As the screen took focus, Robert saw that Duke was still in an interview. \"...and so what you're saying is that you're about to check in on Jackie Rambolina right now?\" \"I'm just sending someone in to keep an eye on her. To make she's you know, taken cared of.\" Duke smiled mischievously. Robert then grew worried and started to panic. He looked from both Jackie to the screen again where the interviewer once again spoke. \"What do you mean by that, Mister Duke?\" \"In about fifteen of my minutes, she will get a special visitor. Just to say hello, I promise.\" Robert couldn't believe what he was hearing. Surely, Duke was not going to send somebody in right now. Robert got out from under his seat and opened the door where he heard footsteps coming from the other end of the hallway. Gasping, he closed the door and locked it. Young Robert looked out the window and saw that it was raining hard. He was about to do something inexplicable. Jackie was Robert's friend, period. Making his way inside Mickey's gym which was now closed, Rocky stood inside the makeshift ring again and waited. He didn't think this time. Every time he thought about something, he would feel worse. Thinking about sad things only makes them worse. He thought. Since he was not going to think about the Jackie situation, he did something else. He pretended he was fighting someone. Practing his jabbing was one of the few moves that made Rocky relive the past all over again. Fighting was the only thing he was good at. Rocky then heard a door open and in came the physically imposing Ivan. From where Rocky was standing in the ring, he can see that Drago's hard face showed clear understanding. Rocky knew it and it stunned him. Had he really changed? \"So...you're here. Do you have an answer?\" Drago spoke. Rocky sighed and put his hands in his pockets. \"You're forgiven.\" \"Thank you. What about other offer?\" After a few brief seconds of silence, Rocky merely nodded and said with a smile. \"Let's get to work.\" Robert was clearly not thinking and he didn't care about the consequences that was likely to ensue should he get caught. He was dragging an unconscious Jackie out of the window. Carrying only the assumption that Duke was sending a hitman or somebody else to hurt or to mock Jackie, Robert was taking no chances. He did however, check to see whether the machines weren't going to affect her should he turn them off. Luckily, her condition didn't change as he tried to lift her from her bed. But due to his size he couldn't and had to pull her by the arms. Breaking the window was not hard for Robert to manage. Grabbing an unknown object, he broke the window and seeing that he was a few stories above, carefully placed Jackie into one of the scaffolds attached to the building. By the time Robert got out of the window himself, he heard someone break the door open. He didn't stop and looked he just held on to Jackie. I have to protect her. She's a sister to me! He thought. On the scaffold, Robert could hardly grab hold of her due to the immense rain pouring down on him. Thunder and lightning occurred nonstop. Robert looked down to see a ladder leading to the ground. He just had to figure out how he was going to hold on to Jackie while climbing down at the same time. As he thought for a solution, Robert heard yelling from up above the window he went out of. A nurse, a doctor and a man wearing a thick blue and white sport jacket was shown. It's Tommy! He gasped. \"Get him!\" A doctor called out. \"He's stealing the patient!\" Robert looked all around to see what he was going to do. Limp as she was, Robert got behind her and with a water hose on the scaffold used it to tie Jackie onto her. As they got several seven feet below the ground, Robert slipped and that was when Jackie fell on the pavement. \"NO!\" Apollo Creed looked at Jackie and he could tell she was considering her options. He knew somehow that she didn't think herself worthy to be alive. Thoughts are nothing sacred. He went over to her. \"What makes you unworthy not to go back?\" \"Everything I've done for starters.\" Jackie said crying. As she did, rain began to fall upon both Apollo and Jackie. They both paid no mind. \"We've all suffered in this world.\" Apollo began. \"Life is like that. You don't need me to tell you that.\" \"If I go back, I know it will be even harder.\" she said. \"Don't give up, Jackie. Rocky needs you! You need him! I've seen it all! He's going to help you in a way you never thought before. You can win this fight!\" \"Then...I will.\" Jackie smiled amidst the rain and tears. \"Remember rain can't go on forever.\" Suddenly a bright flash surrounded the entire area including both Apollo and Jackie. Robert was held against the wall by a gruesome foe his father fought. He kicked and screamed at Tommy Gunn. \"Let go of me! You monster! Why you doing this?\" \"Because I can! Because I ain't no bum like your father!\" he taunted. \"I mean you just killed that girl right now! You just did Duke and me a favor. How does that make you feel?\" It was that remark that made Robert struggle even more. But it was useless. Tommy's hand was around Robert's throat. None of them took note that the sun was showing and yet rain was still falling. Yet despite Robert being choked by Tommy, he saw a marvelous sight. Jackie was rising. She looked around her surroundings including the sky. Despite the hospital gown she wore, Jackie looked like an angel that fell from heaven. Tommy confused by Robert's facial expression turned around and was in deep shock himself. He let go of Robert and as he saw Jackie for a while, her eyes met his. Tommy backed away and walked off. Several people including hospital staff were astounded as to what happened. \"Jackie?\" Robert stepped in front of her. \"I dropped you. I thought you might have died.\" \"Hey...you saved my life buddy.\" she spoke softly. They both embraced.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 It seems everything was on television these days. Nothing unusual was unseen anymore. A spectacle, according to the news reporters, was shown on the screen. On the bar on the bottom of the screen, the title read: 'MIRACLE HAPPENS.' Above it, a young woman was embracing a young man. A dark figure looked at the screen in astonishment and outrage. \"This kind of moment can make a heart explode with joy, ladies and gentlemen. Jackie Rambolina is back.\" The head news reporter stated. \"GAHHHH!\" An enraged George Washington Duke clenched both of his fists and immediately sprang up from his seat. He had just gotten off the phone with Tommy Gunn who gave him the news as to Jackie Rambolina's condition. She was alive. It was enough to make him tear his own hair off. Before he yelled, he had thrown the phone from his desk to the wall to his left. In his office, Duke tried to contemplate his next move. \"What to do? What to do?\" he chimed. Knowing whatever option to incapacitate Jackie was ridiculous and pointless, Duke was reminded of something. He also realized why he had never thought about it before. \"She ain't a man. She's a woman.\" A window of clarity was opened to him. Tommy was all that was man and Jackie was a woman, she was physically inferior to him. ' She has to be. \" He kept repeating what he had just said. He began to chuckle now. \"She'll lose and I'll win!\" he growled. One Week Later… Waking up from his dream, Rocky frowned at what he just experienced. It felt like a dramatic film was shown in his brain. Wiping the tears from his face in great surprise, Rocky sat on the edge of his bed. He then went over what he had seen. \"Hey….what's wrong? Did you have a bad dream?\" Adrian had apparently woken up as well. Rocky was not sure how to answer her. He merely looked at the ground. The fact that he was confused made him feel older. He even looked older than he should. \"All these problems we're dealing with…I'm just…just worn out, I guess. I'll be alright.\" Adrian rubbed his shoulder for comfort. \"You sure?\" Looking at the clock on his drawer, it read 5:43 A.M. \"Today is another day.\" Rocky said. \"You think she can do it?\" Rocky asked Adrian. \"She has you.\" Rocky was unsure whether to tell Adrian the dream he had. He was certain that the dream was accurate. Jackie had awoken due to something extraordinary. He couldn't explain it. ' Maybe I'm just thinking too much .' he shook his head. Jackie Rambolina wasn't out of the woods yet. The fact that she recovered was a miracle to her and to everyone else but it didn't mean she was 100%. Her left shoulder had a torn ligament that the doctors had trouble putting back together. When she got out of the hospital, her arm had been in a sling. She was left unsure as to when her arm would be alright again. To her, it only meant a huge weakness. The fight was coming soon and already she was at a great disadvantage. Nobody knew. Rocky made sure of that. If word had gotten around that she was not in good condition, the fight would be cancelled and Duke would have everything. \"I'm working through the pain.\" Jackie had said. Right now, strategies were being brought forward. In Mickey's old gym, four people stood in the ring. Rocky, Drago, Paulie and Jackie were discussing their plan. \"Tommy Gunn is a lethal killing machine. I understood you faced him before in an alley. But that didn't mean you win.\" Drago said. \"I know.\" Jackie nodded. She agreed. \"He wanted me to beat him so he could get me arrested.\" \"Cheapskate if you ask me.\" Paulie grunted. \"I don't underestimate him if that's what you guys are getting at.\" Jackie nodded. \"I know he's stronger and powerful.\" \"Do not give him credit, kiddo.\" Rocky started. \"Drago and I agree that we should train you so that you can be as tough as him, you know?\" \"But with my arm in such a state, I mean...I wish it would heal faster.\" Jackie said. \"I don't want people especially Duke to find out about this.\" \"We got some solutions for that.\" Drago said. Both Rocky, Drago and even Paulie worked as best they could to conceal Jackie's current condition especially whenever they were outside. In the meantime, Jackie was doing her arm therapy exercises. She was doing all she could to make sure her arm didn't hurt as much as well as making it move the way it was supposed to. That didn't mean there weren't times when she had her cast on. Outside, Jackie jogged. She did this for a full week after arm therapy. After trying to train her arm using heavier weights, she went to do shoulder raises with dumbbells. It was a slow start. But as Rocky had said. \" It's better if you start from the beginning .\" When it came to gain speed, Jackie ran around the neighborhood without her cast on. Everybody on the streets were cheering her on. Jackie had the urge to smile. In Rocky's run-down looking gym once owned by Mickey, a few gym members looked by with interest at the young woman performing an incredible feat. In the middle of the ring, Jackie was doing what seemed to be countless push-ups. What seemed to be her 45th one, Jackie began to struggle. Ivan nevertheless motivated her to keep going. The point was for her to do as many different sets of exercises that a male can do, since Jackie was a girl, she sometimes had a difficult time doing as many exercise sets as she could. \"Just five more!\" he yelled. Under the tutelage of both Rocky and Ivan Drago, Jackie thought she was a big challenge. Fortunately for her, \"I love challenges.\" She thought to herself. Jackie loved being pushed to her limit. Doing push-ups was not something new to her but after since her left shoulder had been shot, it had become a weakness when it came to doing certain exercises. The training was covered into three particular sections. One section which was covered for two hours of speed training by Rocky and the other was for strength covered by Ivan Drago. The other section covered sparring and hitting. Both Rocky and Drago demonstrated and showed her how to do various punches. The purpose of this as Drago illustrated was to confuse your opponent. ' Show him a set of punches and hits and come up with a different set for the next round. ' As she finally reached her limit, Jackie fell face down on the ground. \"50! that's good. Break for now.\" Drago said. Panting, Jackie felt a bit relieved she was going to relax and get back her strength. \"How's it going so far?\" Rocky said as he sat next to Jackie on the bench. \"She needs to gain more muscle.\" Ivan said as he approached them. \"I've been eating like crazy these past couple of days. I guess I need to find another way to get bigger.\" \"Like what?\" Paulie said as he sat down in a slump. \"I need more protein.\" Jackie agreed. \"Just try and eat as much meat as you can. Being skinny will not help in a match like this.\" Drago pointed out. That statement didn't mean that being at a bigger size would help. Toning would have to be initiated as Jackie thought. There were days when she had been doing ab exercises. Doing countless crunches, countless sit-ups, and countless leg raises was a major burn every time. But it was necessary. \"You're faster than he is. You're more brave than he is.\" Robert had said. \"Use it against him!\" he cheered. Everyone basically had a suggestion. Different ideas motivated Jackie. It felt as if something was achieved. Jackie nodded in agreement. She needed all the help she could get. Encouragement was something she looked forward to receiving, always. Strength training was next and it involved Jackie doing intense squats with 215 pounds on her shoulders. Going down and standing back up straight was indeed an obstacle and it took many attempts to perfect the form. \"Down! Down!\" Jackie sweating profusely grunted as she did what was instructed. Several trainers were helping her with the weights to make sure the bar didn't injure her spine. \"Good! Good! Now Up! Up!\" Several people including Rocky motivated her to go on. \"AAH!\" Jackie finally stood back up. Everyone cheered including herself. One day she told Rocky a statement he would never forget. \"I want to keep the Rocky legacy alive.\" He smiled and gave her a hug as a thank you. In a gray sweater filled with sweat, a young woman continued to pant. Putting her hands on her kneecaps. She was on top of a series of steps and behind her stood the museum she had visited with Rocky and his son. Looking down at her hands, she looked at her left arm. Jackie felt a surge of excitement running through her body as she moved it. It didn't hurt. 'At least we don't have to worry about the press anymore.' she thought happily. She then launched her left fist in the air in victory. \"YES!\" Official weigh-in At the weigh-in, both challengers Tommy Gunn and Jackie Rambolina could not be present due to the fact that their presence would only make the debate about man vs woman more viable. On the scale, Jackie Rambolina stood with a worried expression. 'I hope I'm at an appropriate Boxing weight.' She hoped. The announcer then came with the answer. '145! Ladies and Gentlemen!\" Several people immediately revealed their astonishment and awe that they gasp and clapped out loud. Jackie could see on the screen in front of her that her body was ripped with muscle and empty of fat. It was the first time, she saw her body up close. 'Oh my goodness! I'm bigger than most girls now!\" she said in awe. Indeed Jackie's tan body looked like a female bodybuilder would. 'Now I can finally show Gunn what I'm capable of!' she thought happily as the crowd cheered. One week until fight begins… \"…Now you have been training, have you?\" Duke asked Tommy seated behind his desk. Duke began pacing back and forth. Outraged, Tommy answered angrily. \"What's there to train? I'm unbeatable! This girl ain't gonna stand a chance against me!\" Duke sighed. \"Fine! Just make sure to end it quick!\" He almost saw no reason why Tommy should be put on a defensive. He thought a while ago that Jackie did not have the strength to go up against a behemoth like Tommy. Yet, Duke could not figure out why he was so uneasy now. Perhaps it was what he had seen on the television that made him feel worried now. Author's Note: I apologize if this chapter is amazingly late. But I promise to update as soon as I can get better ideas. I had a lot of work to do these past couple of months so I apologize for that. Hopefully I'll get back later on. Please review! Thanks![Chapter 15] Chapter 15 \"You have no power whatsoever in this city nor this office!\" a suited man yelled at the man standing across the room. The statement had been used twice by the mayor who was beyond agitated to the point of throwing the man out on his behind. \"You're only saying that under the assumption that I might not know anything about politics and that I only know a certain damn sport, Mr. Mayor. I have here…\" Duke pulled out a paper held out by one of Duke's people. \"A contract which was made by some friends from out of town. It states the conditions and repercussions pertaining to the event taking place a week from this one. It is ironclad by the way...\" he gave out a sick smile. The mayor had to close his eyes and hung his head putting a hand to his face. Duke continued as if nothing happened. \"The city will be mine should Jackie Rambolina lose.\" \"Do you think you can act with such power? Who do you think you are!? Up until this point, I thought this was just some publicity stunt as a revenge tool against a man who bested you and your pawn!\" The mayor screamed now. \"Let's just say I have friends who work in mysterious ways.\" Duke said calmly and smugly. \"If you don't enforce this, Mr. Mayor, you will be in breach of the other contract you've signed before this thing got even more real. Guess what will happen. And guess...\" Duke began to strut forward so that he can see the mayor in just inches. \"What might happen to you, after I win-\" \"If you win...\" the mayor growled. \"You think you might stick around as mayor?\" Duke grinned. \"You'll have your way for now. But if you lose, my way of getting rid of you will be beyond what you would do to me!\" The mayor stated strongly. \"Let the games begin then.\" Duke smiled. Soon, the media had shown the contract that was supposedly non-negotiable whatsoever. Any attempt to go against it, lawsuits would happen and precious money from the city would be wasted. The fact that the training began primitively had to mean something. Because as the weeks closed in on the big fight, the training got more intense. Jackie felt at times she was nearing her limit. But that didn't mean she gave up. She had graduated from doing bicycle kicks on the ground to doing chin-ups with her legs sticking out forming an angle. Jackie had liked to believe that she was doing every exercise routine in the book. Rocky and Drago had given her good confidence after she completed her workout. The 'good jobs' felt amazing to hear. That didn't mean that there weren't times when she felt a bit bothered. It was a week after the weigh-in and also a week before the actual fight began that Jackie took a walk to relax. It was nearing night and through several sidewalks of unshoveled snow, Jackie began to think about everything at once. Looking around, she saw buildings that once meant something to the people who lived in Philadelphia, Jackie had never lived in such a city but she could tell that the city once had potential, now it seemed to be tarnished by the shadow looming over the city. That shadow was Duke's. Jackie was determined to make an example of him somehow. Eventually making her way on a bridge, Jackie thought about any obstacles Duke might once again attempt. She had to be ready. It was not going to be easy. Despite being stronger and faster now, she grew uneasy and she began to wonder why. She then stood at the edge of the bridge and with her elbows on the bars she looked down where a river of water traveled. \"Is everything supposed to be this hard?\" she asked herself. Waiting. Waiting. She listened for an answer. But there was no response whatsoever from anyone. Anyone who happen to be passing by. Jackie looked behind her and then from her left to right. There was no one. She sighed and began to look at the river below once again. Her life had been a rough road so far. ' Where is the light at the end of the tunnel? I feel like I've been looking forever .' she thought. Jackie wished she had something here right now. Going with the imaginary route when no one came to her side, Jackie proceeded as if she was talking to somebody. \"Maybe...Maybe winning this fight will be my light at the end of the tunnel.\" she said out loud rolling her eyes in the process. Jackie had to be realistic. It was no use going with a childish mentality that everything will go in her favor. The fight was coming and already she was feeling some doubts. \"I need help getting rid of this weakness, this nervousness, this anxiety. That's something no training can do.\" she whispered and rubbed her hands together. The sky had begun to turn dark but rays of light from the sun began to go away and it was getting cold now. One by one, the moody clouds took over and the yellow strands began to disappear. As she saw the beautiful sky above, Jackie's eyes began to well up and a tear ran down her face. If no one was going to answer her questions, she was going to have to be the one to answer them on her own. It seemed ridiculous but she felt a surge of frustration that she had to let out. Talking to herself seemed to be the only way. \"The fact that you're feeling such worry and frustration means you're about to give up.\" \"That might be one reason. I'm not ruling it out.\" Jackie answered. \"You have some affinity for hard work though…\" \"Meaning?\" \"You haven't given up. When nothing was brought to you, you still walked on. Most people wouldn't even keep on going.\" Jackie mumbled. \"I came a long way, true. But so far, I'm still in a phase in my life where I should have been happy. I should have been happy a long time ago.\" \"But you're not…\" Jackie shook her head. \"Remember: things have to get better when they can't get any worse. You can't stop. You've gotten to a point now and it was better than the last one.\" \"But I don't know. I grew up around such a terrible place and I defended myself the only way I knew how. Survival instincts, whatever you want to call them kicked in. I could have been a terrible person just like Tommy Gunn. But I didn't. How is that possible?\" \"Maybe it's your heart, something like that. It's beating. It beats like no one else's. The fact that it is means your spirit is unlike anyone else's. If it was like an ordinary person's, my spirit or whatever would have turned out to be like Clubber Lang or Tommy even. My spirit is unbreakable. Does that mean I can win?\" Jackie had walked throughout her unusual conversation and eventually ended up at the base of the street where the bridge entrance was. The boulevard in front of her was void of people or traffic. Instead of focusing on the empty street, Jackie looked at the small glimmer of light above. She knew it was the sun going away but she didn't want it to go away. The dark sky would have taken over. She looked desperate now. Jackie loved that glimmer of light. It seemed rather absurd but to her it meant peace and warmth. \"Just. Is there a sign out there? Don't go away. If you go away…I don't know if I could do this…\" she then began to cry. It was no use fighting against nature. Jackie thought as the final light went away. Wiping away the tears, she shook her head as she realized that she was crying over a stupid thing now. She began to feel sleepy and decided to go back to Rocky's but not before saying to the invisible passerby. \"Thanks for listening…\" Jackie turned around and walked away. She was unaware that a cloud passed by sluggishly and a glimmer of light reappeared. One flickering light glowed in what used to be a dilapidated building, Mickey's Gym that was now Rocky's. Standing in the middle of a ring, Rocky looked around the room as he was contemplating. It was the very place where he could get some answers to questions that were mind-boggling to him. He had an hour to spare before he went home to sleep. \"I like to think I did my best, I think.\" He mumbled. Rocky sighed and leaned on one of the corners in the ring. \"Mickey. Apollo. Where you at right now?\" Rocky asked looking at the ceiling. He had no idea why he was getting so apprehensive. It was getting to the point where he had to ask the powers that be for advice. \"We live in reality Rocko. I don't think they can hear you from so far away.\" Paulie said as he sluggishly went into the ring, joining his friend. Rocky nodded and realized it was foolish asking for help from the beyond. \"I know.\" he sighed. \"You keep thinking negatively, you'll go old quicker than I'm starting to be.\" Paulie pointed out. \"It's just maybe it ain't bad to be have faith from something or something..,\" Rocky wasn't sure of the word. \"Up there, you know?\" he pointed upwards with his finger. \"We had only one miracle happen, Rocko. Jackie's alive again and I don't think another miracle will happen again if that's what you're asking for.\" Paulie said and stuffed his stogie and his mouth. \"I ain't asking for a miracle, Paulie. I just..\" Rocky had to stop for a moment and consider whether or not he should tell Paulie about the vision he had of Apollo. Instead, he gave the reason why he was alone asking for help from the beyond. \"I need to be sure we're going to be OK.\" \"Oh alright then, I'm sure you'll get your answer soon then.\" Paulie said as he threw his cigar away. \"Come on, Adrian's worried sick.\" \"Yeah. Hey uh...is the crowd-\" \"Yeah, yeah they're gone.\" Paulie shrugged. \"Great. Last thing I want is for the fans to form more walls by our house. They need sleep.\" \"Also asking questions, too.\" Paulie gave out. Together, both Rocky and Paulie left the gym alone. \"You know I want to give Rock the answer.\" Apollo spoke to Mickey standing next to him looking on as Rocky and Paulie left the building. \"Well you can't tell 'im if you don't know the answer, kid.\" Mickey grumbled. \"Then do you?\" Apollo pointed out. Mickey was silent and wasn't sure how to answer his partner. Instead he looked away and looked at the sky. He finally gave an answer as he saw a ray of light ahead. \"You know that 'hope' thing? That feeling you get that ya gonna win but you don't know how you know?\" Mickey asked. \"Sort of.\" Apollo sighed. \"That's what Rocky needs. That's what that there girl needs as well.\" \"But I'm asking you whether he's gonna win or not. I can't bear seeing him like that. You can't bear it either. Give them a sign or something.\" Apollo said desperately. \"I just did kid.\" Mickey patted him with a smile. \"I just did.\"[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 Rocky's POV: Rocky's stern expression never wavered. Hiding behind the curtains to the entrance where Jackie was to make her presence shown, Rocky took a quick peek at the enormous crowd of people in the arena. Because of the controversy as well as the popularity of the fight, people who were unfortunate to be seated where standing by the stairs leading to the rows of seats. Some were standing at the boundary where the ring stood in the middle. Rocky never took heed nor notice of the crowd of people seeing his fights back then. He never felt any pressure. He almost did when he took Tommy Gunn under his tutelage. ' With Tommy, I looked around in the ring that one time he fought and…I realized how I should have been scared at the people all around.' Rocky felt nervous and worried for Jackie now. ' I want to be a great trainer like Mickey and Apollo were. But if I'm worried, how can feeling like that help?' Rocky thought. He sighed and contemplated what he saw. Rocky never saw this many people in his whole life and he didn't expect it to be go from a news media to beyond a news media. Because he felt a bit anxious, Rocky made himself feel worse by pretending to be in Jackie's position. 'Would I have a chance against winning the crowd and winning the fight?' he asked himself and then walked away and went into the hall. Rocky shook his head and realized he couldn't concentrate. He was too busy listening on the speakers hanging in the walls telling the details of the upcoming match happening in an hour. \"…apparently the whole city of Philadelphia seems to be all over the place right now. I can see all around people with banners suggesting their support for the underdog and get this, female boxer Jackie Rambolina, who has the weight on the city on her shoulders.\" \"I can see that Larry, and almost every commentator from the country and even from other countries is joining the frenzy as well.\" \"This fight is big. It's huge!\" \"It is beyond huge, Harry. Today may be the day that a city will be free or handed over on a silver platter.\" \"Larry, I'm also thinking how interesting it's going to be for a woman like Jackie Rambolina going against someone who is twice her size and with twice her strength.\" \"Today is the day, ladies and gentlemen were it all goes down. All eyes are on Philadelphia now. Whatever the outcome, it will go down in history regardless.\" Rocky looked away from the speaker box on the wall and looked toward the hall ahead of him. He eagerly went toward it. Jackie's POV: Opening her eyes, her mind was all over the place. Thinking was no longer a constant. It was beyond a habit. Thinking was indestructible. Her body tightened and hardened itself to prepare for what was about to happen. Jackie knew about pain hence, it was nothing new to her. In the stadium, Jackie tried her hardest not to think about anything that can be used as weakness. She tried hard not to be pessimistic. It was difficult for Jackie not to think about what was at stake. Jackie tried her hardest not to go into a lucid state as well. Going out like a zombie was not a good way to go down. \" Do not think about the past….Focus on the event. Focus in the fight. Focus…on him. \" she told herself repeatedly. She let go of her past. She let go of her mistakes. Her recent actions had led her to one place and one place only. In the stadium, soft cries from the crowd awaiting the much anticipated fight in the history of Boxing. A woman versus a man. Jackie was also one who thought the concept was an appalling one. She was also someone that a man versus a woman would never happen. She thought about it a long time ago. Looking back, she remembered a scene with her father when she was seven. In an old-fashioned gym, a young child with her hair in a pigtail was busy moving around purposefully in the middle of the gym running around an older figure. Her father, a man of wild bushy hair and face like a lion held up his gloves as he blocked his daughter's blows. The blows were fast and almost accurate and the man had the urge to give a smile at his daughter's progress. \"Good! Good! That was good!\" he patted her in her cheek as he took off his glove. They both sat on the mat, each drinking a Coca-Cola bottle. The young Jackie looked at his father with eager glee. \"Really? You think I could be one of those fighters like on TV? Like Rocky Marciano?\" she asked excitedly. \"Of course you can sweetheart. You can do anything you set your mind to.\" the man replied. \"But do you really think they'll ever let girls fight?\" \"Anyone can fight.\" \"Even that man who keeps following you?\" The man closed his eyes in anguish and reluctance. He nodded. \"Even that man honey.\" he said a bit sadly. \"Why don't you fight him, daddy?\" she asked him softly. \"You know why, sweetie.\" Young Jackie looked uncertain for a second before he caught the glimmer in her dad's eye. \"Fight when it's right?\" \"Exactly.\" the man pointed. It didn't take her long to figure out that the man that followed her dad had killed him for not paying back a certain loan. \" All for money. \" she answered. Jackie remembered when her father was taken down but she chose to erase that thought out of her mind completely. But one thing didn't change. It was money that was the root of all evil. Like the very evil that was plaguing the city of Philadelphia right this very moment. She wished she could confront the man that killed her father. 'Maybe in a way I can. ' she thought. The man who had killed her father was gone. But Jackie can make him reappear in her thoughts. She can even put his projection on another man's face. George Washington Duke. He was a representative of what money did to people. \" Duke may not have killed my father but I can pretend he could. Tommy Gunn will be the byproduct of that monster. \" she thought. Jackie could not yet forget how Tommy had managed to put her in jail. But only because he feigned weakness. For a time, because Tommy held his power back, Jackie became worried that she hadn't begun to face Tommy yet despite her fighting him in that alleyway. ' He could still be stronger and faster than I am.' Nervousness had taken hold of her that quickly. But she realized that she had something Tommy didn't have. 'People that cared.' She used that very concept to sharpen her mentality and helped give her a hard look when necessary. Today having hardness was a necessity. Anger flooded her entire body now. All the hate and all the loathing for such a man made her that much stronger. It was time a point was made. A point that even a female contender can save a city. That particular statement was also pointed out in a billboard outside. She had to agree with those words strongly. For that she rose up from her table and prepared to walk out of the resting room. \"Duke, you think you know suffering? You haven't even begun...\" she growled. The door to the ready room had opened and in walked a stout, muscular figure with a lop-sided grin. \"Ready?\" Rocky said. \"You didn't even have to ask.\" Drago's POV: \"I'm doing the right thing and it feels...different.\" Drago told himself this as he was debating of what kind of person he was becoming. ' Having emotions is difficult.' He had finally realized what it was like to be someone who cared. To really care. He thought of Jackie now and how she had told him her upbringing and how so similar her background was to his. It surprised him greatly. Throughout her training, he had taken the time to get to know her. The interaction was very informative. Drago thought her personality along with her strength was impressive. He was thinking back two weeks ago when he had engaged in an interesting conversation with her. Ivan stood in a stiff, defensive position. His hands were out in front of him as Jackie punched him in the chest and in the abdomen repeatedly. Her gloves connected with his body like small blanks. They were that hard. The reason he was being inflicted pain was an obvious one. To see how much pain she was capable of giving an opponent. \"Good practice today.\" he had said in a thick Russian accent. \"Thanks.\" Jackie said out of breath. \"You should go home take a rest.\" Rocky said. Jackie smiled. Drago could tell that because Rocky mentioned 'home', it meant she was not alone anymore and that moved Ivan greatly. He fought the urge to smile. Rocky gave a solemn smile and a shrug that suggested a wave of goodbye to him. Ivan had nodded back in understanding. \"May I ask you a question?\" Ivan spoke to her as she was packing up. Jackie looked up and waited for what he had to say. \"What was it like for you to want to make you push as hard you possibly could?\" Jackie looked away. Apparently the topic was a sad one for her to administer. \"I'm not sure if I should talk about it.\" she said and went back to packing her things. \"I know Rocky told you to trust me but you don't do you?\" he said sadly. Jackie remained silent before she managed to say with difficulty. \"I know about the whole Apollo thing.\" \"I can only apologize so many times.\" he said. \"I don't blame you. You come from another country. Hence, people will underestimate someone foreign.\" \"Those people outside should underestimate you.\" Drago had said. \"But they don't. They have never heard of me until half a year ago.\" \"I know you're not Rocky but for some reason, I can feel a quality of him in you.\" He said looking down as if the words were difficult for him to say. \"Thanks I guess.\" \"Someone once said if you only hold anger in from different times in your life and you haven't acted with it before, that amount of anger will make you unstoppable.\" Drago started. \"Maybe, right now you can use it.\" He said carefully. Jackie didn't respond to that and merely thought about it. Ivan stopped thinking and looked at Rocky walking down the hall. He had stopped right in front of him and gave Ivan a nod that meant 'it was on.\" Walking down to the arena, Jackie blocked out whatever the crowd threw at her. Be it jabs, boos or cheers, she didn't know what they were yelling about. She could only smiled at the crowd in encouragement but thought nothing of it. Her personality had to be shown regardless of what she felt or didn't feel. Batting her eyes would not signify a strong individual instead she gave a bright expression that indicated she was happy to be in such a place. She had to remained focus. Distractions were never helpful. In the arena, the ring lay there bright and big. To enter it, was going to be something unique and overwhelming. This was the first time Jackie was stepping into an actual ring with actual spectators. 'There's like a million people here!' she gasped. Slightly trembling, Jackie tried to stop it and go into the ring without any hesitation. Nothing more needed to be explained. It was time. After the announcer named Michael Buffer said an interesting catchphrase, it took a full three minutes for the crowd to stop shouting and clapping. Looking behind her, outside the ring, she saw Rocky, Paulie, Drago and young Robert looking up at her giving her their own signs of approval and appraise. Jackie's POV: Thinking back to when both she and Rocky were in the locker room, Jackie was reminded of something inspiring Rocky had said to her. \"I think I gave you all the advice I can give…\" Rocky said as he walked around the room rubbing his temples. He sighed and realized what he went through himself to be put in this situation. Jackie was not only fighting for respect in general, but she was also fighting for freedom. He looked at Jackie who looked down seemingly in a daze. \"When I was out there for the first time…\" Rocky started. \"I realized this was going to be something special. A ring, big like that, the chances were I wasn't going to stand on it again.\" \"I know exactly what you're thinking.\" Rocky continued. \"That you're not going to win.\" Jackie looked at him in surprise. \"Maybe it's not about beating him to get you and the city free, maybe it's getting back up as fast you can.\" Rocky said and knelt down where she could see him at level. \"When you get knocked down so many times, that pain you might feel, you have to endure it as best you can. Just focus on getting back up again and again and again…\" \"It's the only way to win.\" He finished. Jackie smiled as she realized and thought to her amazement why she never considered that option before. Inside the ring, it was too late to calculate her options. \"I want to do this. I need to do this. I'm going to do this.\" She recited. \"Remember she's already down. This is just a big show for everybody. Make them see why they should underestimate me! Only me!\" Duke who was standing below the ring cried out. Jackie rolled her eyes at Duke's ranting and went back to concentrating to who she was facing. She saw Tommy Gunn with an intimidating pose in the opposite corner of the ring. He seemed more than willing to knock her down. His steely eyes penetrated her own and not wanting to be taken aback, Jackie gave an angry look herself. After the referee gave the rules and protocols about the match, he got down off the ring and prepared to hit the bell. The announcers were still explaining their excitements about the fight about to happen in a matter of seconds. The bell then rang and with her fists guarding her face, Jackie stepped toe-to-toe with Tommy Gunn. At this point, it was all on her own. Tommy's fist met Jackie's right forearm while she launched a hit to his face which was unfortunately blocked by his own forearm. The next thing Jackie knew she was blinded by overbearing pain to the left side of her face and fell to the ground. She had a few seconds to consider whether or not she was going to get back up again.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 Discontent was almost impossible to bear but even more impossible when the very idea that such foreboding might never end. At least that was what Ivan thought when he saw Jackie getting a vicious hit from the seemingly unstoppable brute, Tommy Gunn. Despite the fact that he was still new in this country, Ivan Drago could ironically see how the people in America were no different from that of his native Russia. 'When it comes to tough times, even people here cling to hope against despair... ' Ivan thought. All around him people were yelling, cheering, and shouting all at once that it was entirely incoherent for Drago to make out. What Drago wanted to hear, if they really wanted Jackie to win, was to say 'we have faith in you. ' Instead cries from the audience consisted of ' you monster! how dare you hit a woman! you think you're a real man, now? ' Over on the other side of ring, Drago could see George Washington Duke rubbing his fingers and nodding, apparently showing his satisfaction at what just occurred. His distaste for the man immediately elevated. ' How dare he take pleasure in a woman being beaten... ' Ivan wished that Duke could understand how very mistaken was he. \"He doesn't know...\" he said out loud. 'He doesn't know how strong she has become...\" Smirking, Ivan crossed his arms to his broad chest looking completely satisfied. Although completely and entirely invisible, Apollo and Mickey materialized right next to Rocky, who was outside of the ring. They looked at him with eager concern as he crossed his arms to his chest apparently looking apprehensive to the last degree. Apollo looked stunned to find out that Ivan was also there, right next to Rocky, motioning for Jackie to get up and continue. However, Apollo began to get focused on the fight but he took a moment to see his friend and he could tell that Rocky wanted to be inside the ring and help Jackie. But at the same time, Apollo could feel that Rocky understood the simple concept. The concept that the torch needs to be carried down. The mantle has to keep going. The legacy has to continue. As much as it pained Rocky to realize that, he had come to accept it. \"She's gonna make it Rock.\" Apollo nodded as he looked at the ring as well. He had seen what Jackie's will and determination had led her to. ' Fighting for liberty and opportunity.' However, the scenery got bad when Tommy Gunn, gave Jackie a hit to her head, the hit was enough to incapacitate even a male fighter. Apollo saw how upset Rocky got. Below the platform, Rocky pounded his fists and shouted desperately to Jackie. \"Jackie! Jackie!\" he cried out. Apollo thought the crowd was equally desperate as well as they bellowed out their cries of disapproval. He looked at Mickey for words of advice or even words of encouragement. All he could was give a simple nod. But to Apollo, a nod didn't seem enough. A contemplating Apollo looked down and closed his eyes trying to make sense of everything and tried his hardest of what to do, but of course, nothing logical came to mind. Two ghosts that only helped out once. Apollo wished that he could help once again. Shaking his head, Mickey finally spoke up. \"Man, even I hate seeing stuff like this. I understand what you're feeling, Creed.\" \"Really?\" Apollo asked skeptically. \"Right now, things are moving but you wished you could be the one controlling the dice if you know what I'm sayin'.\" \"I guess so. But she's gotta get up. She's got to keep fighting…\" Apollo wanted more than anything to see Jackie prevail and also see his friend Rocky content. Reason being, rocky finally learned what it was like to be the ultimate warrior. Apollo understood in a way what Rocky told him not too long ago: \" Without some damn war to fight, then the warrior may as well be dead, Stallion!\" he cried out. ' Cause we sure as hell can't be born again! \" Rocky spoke up at the time. \" I know we can't be born again. But look at that…\" Rocky motioned to the television screen where Rocky and Apollo, both in their primes were going at it. \" I know you don't want to believe this but that ain't us anymore Apollo, we can't do that the way we did it before. We're changing. It's like we're turning into regular people!\" It had been quite a while when Rocky had said that to him. He didn't want to believe it. Apollo had assumed that he was just as strong as he was when he had been younger. But of course, it ended in a premature demise at the hands of Ivan Drago. But Apollo understood now. He realized right now, that the torch had to be passed to the next one worthy. \"We can't interfere in this one, Creed. We have to watch the darn thing play itself out. We ain't some cheap cheaters.\" \"So we're just two mere spectators then?\" Apollo asked incredulously. \"Yep.\" Mickey nodded. Jackie was in a crouched position and looked completely dazed. The fact that a man had brought a fighter down, especially one that was a woman, was already getting everybody riled up. She felt pain on the side of chin which spread out down to her chin. ' That was a hell of a wake-up call... ' she muttered. \"Jackie, come on! Get up!\" Rocky said as he smacked the canvas in emphasis. \"6!\" the referee's voice bellowed out. Jackie finally opened her eyes and despite the searing pain coming from her skull, she finally became self-aware of herself. She felt she had woken up and her system was a bit off balance. Judging by what the referee just said, it had been six seconds when she experienced a mellow blackout. The crowd of people all around the immense stadium were standing with anxious expressions on their faces. The figure on the ground could tell by the loud volume of cries echoing down to the ring. Breathing heavily, she used ropes to get herself back up. Looking above, the headlights from the stadium's ceiling was shining brightly down with intensity. \"8!\" the referee bellowed. Jackie considered the hit a wake-up call but not only that, she knew how it felt to get hit with brute force. What was amazing was that she recovered. ' I'm about to get a million more of that though. Let's hope I can keep going! ' she thought. She finally stood up and she could get a glimpse of Tommy Gunn looking astounded. The crowd nevertheless cheered for Jackie's determination. Excitement had filled the arena once again. The referee came over to her and demanded she at least sit down and whether she wanted to continue the fight. Several posters met her eyes such as 'Girls can hit just as hard as boys!' 'Equality exists in rings too!' but the one that caught her eye was a poster that read 'Fight when it's right!' ' It couldn't be just a coincidence!' Jackie thought. But one thing was certain, her pain went away. Looking back at Tommy, now more than ever, she wanted to show him what she was made of. \" He's going to pay for that hit !\" And so she shook her head desperately and because she did, she heard Rocky cheering louder than the crowd did. The second round had started with the ringing of the bell. Jackie slowly circled around the ring and Tommy did the same. Both wanted to know how to hit the other. It was all about who could do the most damage. Jackie was the one in particular, who really wanted to cause so much damage. She could tell that Tommy thought she might be easy. 'He's very mistaken. ' she thought. The opportunity arose when Tommy came forward and came at her with a quick jab, which Jackie blocked with her right gloved fist. Tommy proceeded with quick punches that Jackie blocked and missed entirely. 'He's clumsy...He relies on brute strength... ' Jackie realized. She was soon back into a corner where Tommy pummelled her. Jackie put her fists up to block the overwhelming attack but the force behind those punches was almost unbearable. The crowd booed and Jackie could hear Duke practically cackling. It was so disgusting. \"Don't go down, Jackie! Don't go down!\" Rocky cried out in spite of the loud booming voices coming from the crowd and from one of the announcers. \"She's just getting ambushed right here, Harry, it's insane!\" \"Break it up! Break it up!\" the referee came and broke it off as quickly as possible. Jackie felt at ease once Gunn was away from her. Tommy was at the opposite corner now. Jackie needed to restrategize. A trickle of blood came from her which she wiped away so that the crowd nor Rocky would see her in a fragile state. She was done being the punching bag, she had to fight back with fire of her own. The round recommenced and Jackie circled once again around the ring, with Tommy doing the same. Tommy came in with his fists coming at her. Jackie angry for being caught off guard the first time, took the opportunity to use her plan. She had been upset now that Tommy was coming at her the same way he had done by pushing her into a corner. ' Not this time... ' she thought and blocked his attacks. A punch was aimed to her head which she had ducked. Getting up, she dodged and evaded his incoming attacks. She swerved and even spun which received a lot 'wows' from the audience. A defining moment came as soon as Tommy tried to land another hard punch, Jackie had ducked once more being as fast as she was, and thus succeeded in landing a strong cross punch to his face. The force of it had knocked the sweat off his face. The crowd cheered louder than ever. Excitement had filled the arena as well as Rocky when he nodded in satisfaction. \"Yes! Yes!\" Rocky bellowed. Ivan did the same by clapping his hands. Tommy staggered by the force of that hit. Jackie took the opportunity to come at him with her own volley of punches. He looked so dumbfounded, it was so comical. It had been a full second that Tommy realized he had been hit and never knew that he was being hit now. Jackie could see the confusion in his eyes, it was why she took immediate advantage. Jackie warmed up Tommy's ribs with fast punches and even managed to land another hit to Tommy's face. Enraged, Tommy however, took control of the situation once again by getting out of the corner he was in, and shoved Jackie into it. She was now the one getting hit again. Rocky tilted his head away in frustration as he saw how the tables had turned again dramatically. He looked back and motivated her to go on. \"No pain, Jackie, No pain!\" Jackie, who had her elbows and fists locked up, blocking Tommy's fists from hitting her face, finally let her plan unfold. Tommy had been getting sloppy, each time he had to throw a punch, he took the time to send his elbow back and then hit, elbow and then hit, the process was time consuming and Jackie was surprised Tommy hadn't figure it out. It was a weakness he couldn't afford to have. As soon as Tommy put his elbow before he ever hit Jackie, she already landed a quick to his chin. He immediately stumbled and Jackie threw in several fast jabs to his face and gut. His face seemed reconfigured badly now and she thought she had dislocated Tommy's jaw. She could feel that the punch she gave was hard enough to put an everlasting dent on a punching bag. As soon as Tommy inched away from her in the corner, Jackie got out of it and circled around the ring where she could see that a trickle of blood was pouring out of his mouth. It was a gruesome scene. Tommy was gritting his bloody teeth with furious anger. He was literally seething. Tommy came at her like a bull on fire and tackled her to the ground. The force of his entire body knocked the wind out of Jackie. Pandemonium ensued in a fraction of a second. Tommy's trainers, Rocky, Drago, Paulie and the referee as well as other officials broke off the scuffle. The ringing of the bell sounded off repeatedly as a warning of a potential disqualification if the unnecessary rough action continued. Jackie felt like being manhandled in a sense. Throughout her life, Jackie was a tomboy. And because she was, she could stand up and hold her own against an average person, let alone an average male. But Tommy was superior in strength and what had just occurred was certainly proof of that. She only had a minimum time to cover her face from being hit. Finally she was able to stand up as several people picked Tommy Gunn off of her. She lay out spread out with her arms opened wide. Jackie could taste blood coming out of her mouth now. Frustrated, she turned herself over and caught a glimpse of Duke outside the ring giving her a 'ha ha' look. She gave him a steely look. \"Talk about a cheap shot! Gunn has 'speared' Jackie Rambolina to the ground and now he's trying to make Jackie a victim here, Larry.\" \"The crowd is outraged that Tommy Gunn, the former heavyweight champion taking such a low, low…low measure just to win the fight.\" \"I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't any more Gunn supporters.\" Harry stated. \"I'm thinking 'ziltch' as well.\" Larry suggested. In a way, the round had been over and after the referee gave a firm warning to Tommy Gunn which lasted a full minute. The whole fight decided to keep going. Jackie has since told the referee that she was fine and she was still in fighting shape. While it was bothering to be checked like a hospitalized little girl, Jackie just wanted to get the fight over with. All Jackie needed to hear was the ringing of the bell. The third round was about to begin and already Jackie was feeling a bit exhausted. But for the first time, ever since she saw Duke's hideous smile a minute ago, she wanted to win desperately. The bell rang and again Tommy tried to go on a tackling position but stopped right in front of her and gave Jackie the usual volley of punches and jabs. Jackie ducked and evaded the blows as best she could, she even managed to slip in some hits of her own. Right now, she focused on all her energy in taking Tommy Gunn down. She ignored the crowds and the announcers. Bottom line: it all came down to durability. In other words, which one would last throughout the entire ordeal. Using methods that were similar to martial arts, Jackie had no trouble keeping up with the blocking and evading. She was faster than Gunn and she set out to prove it. Already the announcers were loudly stating their opinions of Jackie and it was all good to her. \"The whole crowd is going insane and I have to say I can't blame them Larry for the fact that Jackie seems to be holding her own as well as trying to take a man like Tommy Gunn down!\" \"She could go all the way or she could go the other way which even I don't want to have happen.\" Jackie was trained in the boxing way for a long time. She was built to a stronger point and for that reason alone, she delivered the crux of the plan and it was all in her right fist. To her it was considered to be a coup de grace. As soon as she saw an opening, she went for it. Her fist had landed on Tommy's left side of his left shoulder. It had him stumbling now 'His deltoid has to be messed up now.\" Jackie thought. \"Shake it off! Just shake it off and finish her so I can have everything!\" Duke yelled from below the ring. Obeying, Tommy shook his arm off and as soon as he was alright again. He went up to Jackie again. The fact that he had stopped to shake off whatever effect his arm was feeling was the wrong thing for him to do. Jackie took the chance and as if she were in a street fight. She gave a rock solid punch to Gunn's face with her left and right fist. A deadly combination. Tommy was bleeding now. But he still didn't fall down which aggravated Jackie even more. ' He has to go down… ' Her blows were not hard enough to knock Tommy down. Instead, he stumbled backwards. He wiped the blood coming out of his nose now. He was astounded that he had bled. He looked murderous. \"You're going down, b-\" But his words were cut off as Jackie proceeded once again to pummel Tommy to the ground with her own sets of punches. This time the bell rang just for her and the referee told her to calm down and she settled back into the corner where Drago, Paulie and Rocky attended to her. She was supplied with water and her teeth guard were being replaced. \"Hey, you doing great…\" Paulie patted her on the shoulder gently. \"I know. I know, you do better yourself sometimes.\" she managed to say weakly. Paulie scratched his head and looked as if he had a feeling of Deja Vu. Jackie was indeed getting very tired. She felt as if she were passing out. Breathing in and out, she was drained and felt a bit confused now. Below the ring, Mickey and Apollo were looking at Jackie with close inspection. Jackie looked away from Rocky, Drago, and Paulie for a moment. Jackie began to give a warm expression as she stared off at the outside of the ring. Apollo blinked as he tried to understand what Jackie was seeing. He looked behind him then back to her. \"Wait...is she?\" Apollo began. \"Yeah...\" Mickey nodded smiling. \"She can see us?\" \"Yep.\" \"How?\" \"Well, let's just say she still got more people to support her, kid.\" The crowd cheered higher than usual almost as if they had been looked at by Jackie Rambolina.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 Apollo and Mickey stood right next to Rocky once more. Rocky had been gripping the mattress portion of the ring, he looked as if he would tear it off. Apollo could not believe that his friend was that nervous and rightfully so. All of it was up to the girl trying to take down a man twice her weight and size. Everything Rocky felt was unbearable. Trying to hold onto something that he can't have any control over. Rocky wished he could turn the tide of the fight to his favor. Apollo went up to Rocky with tears in his eyes as soon as his friend had calmed down. Despite him not being able to see or hear him, Rocky looked a bit calmer. Apollo then spoke. \"Stallion, you don't give up hope you hear? You don't give up hope…\" Apollo looked back at Mickey for reassurance and all he did was give Apollo a simple nod. \"Otherwise she wouldn't have gotten this far. You hold on. Tell her she needs to hold on…\" he insisted. \"But first you need to concentrate and not lose your mind. If she sees you break, you break. It's all about that extra mile.\" \"I have to tell her…\" Rocky muttered and went off as soon as the bell was over. Apollo looked a bit surprised. Pain was one thing. Suffering was another. Jackie was sick and tired of it. After seeing Apollo and some other guy in the stands, Jackie thought she might have been hallucinating. ' Maybe I've been hit too much. ' Several bruises were shown on her face. Realization started to set in. ' That's the problem. I've been getting hit throughout all my life… ' she thought. Jackie didn't know what to do and looked at Rocky, whom had given her a bottle of water to reload. He began to talk fast before the bell sounded and the match continued. \"There's still some hope left!\" An unresponsive Jackie looked at him trying to understand how. All she could do was pant, sweat and bleed. \"There's some hope left…\" he repeated looking sympathetic. She nodded with what Rocky said to her. It made sense. \"I've come this far…I've come this far.' she repeated to herself in her mind. Remembering thinking she saw Apollo made her realize that hope in general, had not died. She looked at Tommy, who looked at her determined to pummel her to the ground. She saw that he was angry. Jackie now reached a new level of anger. \"I'm taking this guy down…\" she stated. Rocky nodded. \"Do what you got to do.\" The bell rung and the match resumed. The loud audience added more tension and excitement. The final round was coming up but that didn't mean that Jackie was going down. She treated each round as if it were final round. In her mind, she was amazed how she lasted so long. ' Story of my life …' she thought. She barely blocked Tommy's brutal punch with both gloves raised. \"Incredible evasive technique by Jackie Rambolina!\" the delirious announcer Harry exclaimed. \"This is close to the final round, Harry. The crowd graduated from going nuts to going crazy.\" Larry stated. Tired was something she could not afford to be and that was what Jackie was close to being at the moment. Sweat poured down to her eyes making them sting. The stinging effect was uncalled for and to Jackie, it was a distraction. A few hits had been issued to her face and body. Her counter punches had been evaded and blocked. The crowd murmured their disappointment now. Jackie had run herself to exhaustion and soon everybody would notice it. \"It seems Jackie's power is winding down folks. This cannot be!\" Harry stated to the microphone. ' I need a break!' she thought frantically. It seemed as if she lost all control now. She couldn't tell her body to do this. She couldn't tell her body to do that. Eventually she was knocked to the ground by a punch that was hard to put a dent on a car, knocking her out almost cold. The crowd voiced their frustration and anger. Jackie could still hear it despite feeling down and out. The referee began counting until six now. Duke was already jumping up and down with joy as was shown on his face. \"Yes! Yes! Yes! that's what I'm talking about!\" he then turned back at the booing spectators. \"I told y'all I was gonna win!\" Tommy taunted Jackie and demanded she get up now. Jackie used the ropes to try and pick herself up as fast as she could before the referee reached '10'. Getting up, she had wrapped her arms around the ropes aligning as the barrier of the ring and hoisted herself upward. The audience clapped at her incredible revival. The fight was about to continue. \"Oh come on!\" a frustrated Duke responded amidst the crowd of cheering spectators. He was enraged that she had not been defeated. \"To say that Jackie Rambolina has more lives than a cat is an understatement, here. Larry!\" the announcer spoke to the camera. \"Hey dingus! She's got more balls than you put together!\" Paulie pointed out from ahead. Her anger and concentration returned and now she was fighting ferociously. As if a cheetah attacked a gazelle, Jackie went at Tommy as fast as she could. Tommy eventually fought back with his hard-hitting punches which made her stagger back. She had an opening which was more of an opportunity, That opportunity lasted a second and she took it. Jackie had hit Tommy upward in the chin making fall back. He was rubbing his jaw and shook it. The referee came to his side and demanded what was wrong. A jab was issued to her gut making her stumble and it was that very hit that caused her to lose focus at the right time. The bell had rung. Immediately she ran back to her corner where Rocky and Paulie were waiting to tend to her. Struggling in pain, Jackie told them what's happened. \"I think he damaged something vital.\" \"You gonna be alright?\" Paulie asked. \"I almost can't breathe.\" Jackie panted. \"If you did not tighten your core when he hit you, it would have been a lot worse.\" Drago stated. \"So does that mean she's lucky to be alive?\" Paulie asked Drago. Drago just looked at Paulie with an annoyed expression. Rocky nevertheless came up with one more piece of advice. \"Jackie…there's one more round left. I know you're hurt but I promise you and this is something I know firsthand…\" Jackie listened intently. \"When you're through that final round of pain, it stops. It stops.\" Rocky nodded at the last part. Jackie nodded. She really believe that and yes, she took what she could get. Every time Rocky said something inspirational, it was like a burst of strength. Her adrenaline would spike up in a good way. She wished the broadcasters below the ring would be more encouraging. ' Thank you for that one. ' she thought. Her pain in her core was an unbearable one but since this was the last one, Jackie was going to go at Tommy with everything she had left. \"Larry, this is it. This is the moment. The final round. The one everyone in the city of Philadelphia is waiting for…\" the broadcaster Harry stated. \"Harry, the momentum is building up, it's skyrocketing. The whole stadium is in a delirium. The excitement is in the air like static electricity.\" \"This is what is coming down to. If Jackie wins, the city of Philadelphia will be left alone, if Tommy wins, Duke gets it.\" \"Oh man, Harry. My pulse is quickening over this.\" One could tell that everyone in the stadium was holding their breaths in. They were waiting for the outcome with great anticipation. The bell was about to ring and thus, would begin the final round. Rocky crossed his arms and looked content all of a sudden as he saw Rocky with her hands, ready to fight Tommy for what could be the last time. Behind him, Rocky saw the audience chanting someone's name. Two syllables. Rocky assumed it was his own name. But as he listened carefully, he figured out it was someone else's name. Not his. It was Jackie. There was no one else in the arena that the audience was going for. It was all for Jackie. \"Jackie! Jackie! Jackie!\" the crowd chanted as well as clapping. George Washington Duke folded his arms to his chest and merely rolled his eyes at the crowd, trying hard not to pay any attention to them. 'I know I'm gonna win. The crowd ain't gonna do squat to help her...' he thought. The crowd would not stop saying Jackie's name and it was getting to him now. Finally he had enough, Duke turned to Tommy and yelled. \"You better win this boy! Do you know what I would do to you, if you lose?\" A perplexed Tommy looked back at Duke and wondered why he had always been hard on him. Looking back at Jackie along with Rocky, Drago and Paulie at her side, he marveled as to how she had gotten this far. 'It was because of them...because of him. ' he thought. Rocky never led him to rich and fame. It was the absence of wealth that made Tommy frustrated with Rocky. Now that he had such resources, Tommy felt it wasn't worth it anymore. Thinking back, he realized something Rocky had said when he had been his manager. It had been before Tommy won the title. He and his girlfriend were in the car ready to head off to the stadium. Rocky had come up to talk to him before he left: 'Listen Tommy, we need to talk'. 'Later Rock.' No, no. listen Tommy. It's about Duke.' 'I'm 22 and 0. Where's the money? The way I was going. I wasn't going to get a shot of the title for a long time. I'm signing papers with the man tomorrow!' 'This is what Mick told me about. About the business, the dirty part of the business. These managers, when they represent these fighters, they promise them the world, then they, they suck' em dry, leave them, leave them in the gutter, broke Tommy!' 'This is what I'm talkin' about? You know Tommy? Duke. Duke, he's, he's like a vampire Tommy. He's living off of your blood Tommy.' 'I ain't you and you ain't Mick. When are you gonna realize that this is a business? In a business you need...' 'What? Brains? you say that I don't have any brains Tommy?' 'No. you said that, not me. Look, Rock. You took me as far as you could, but Duke gave my title shot, you didn't. If you still want to train me do it, but if you don't, don't. But it's my or it's the highway!' As soon as he stopped thinking about that incident, Tommy felt a wave of emotions weighing heavily on him. It had been sadness, regret, and sorrow. He began breathing heavily now. It was a revelation that was affecting him mentally and physically. He looked around at the arena where the audience continued to chant Jackie's name. No one had called out his name. Not one person. But at the same time, Tommy refused to believe that Jackie would win. He tried shaking off whatever doubts he had. The last thing he wanted was to get beaten by a girl twice. ' She's gonna hit the mat right now!' he thought. Growling like an angry lion and ready to attack, Tommy hopped up and down to amp himself. ' This is it, man. No turning back now… ' he told himself. Jackie felt very encouraged when she heard her name being called out by the crowd. It made her feel special. The thought that people thought of her as a beacon of hope, a force for good and a wondrous soul. As was read by one of the posters, it said. 'Wondrous Soul'. \"Duke's not getting this city...\" she whispered. With no more time to waste, the bell sounded and Jackie prepared for the last round of her life. No time to think anymore. The pair: Jackie and Tommy stared each other down. Both of them had waited a long time for the bell to ring an now both of them studied the other in an attempt at how he or she would pull off the first punch. It was nothing new. Jackie felt like another person. She fought a battle inside her at the same time she was fighting Tommy Gunn. ' I have to fight these fibers of doubt and despair. I have to hit them as hard as I can! ' she thought. Tommy came at her and sent out a punch to the side of her head, which she barely avoid. She hit back with a upper cut to Tommy's face. ' I have to fight to get rid of these past events that tried to hold me down...' she thought. Jackie yelled and drove herself and Tommy to the nearest corner, where with all her might hit Tommy in his core again and again. She tried hard not to get tired and relied on whatever energy reserves she had available. ' I have to fight to save a city that doesn't deserve to be driven down to the ground like I have... ' she thought. Gunn got out of the corner he was in and now began to fight ferociously but recklessly. He took Jackie's throat and dragged her back to the corner and now she was the one once again being pummeled. \"Yes! Yes! Knock her down! Take her down!\" Duke below bellowed out. Tommy stopped when the referee came and gave him a warning. He raised his arms in triumph to the crowd. The crowd immediately booed. Jackie held her core to stop the throbbing pain but raised her head upward to look at Tommy Gunn, who continued to be amazed at Jackie's persistence. \"It ain't over until it's over...\" she breathed out. The fight continued and Jackie had been met with a hit to his face which made her bleed from nose. Paying it no mind, she launched devastating right punches to Tommy's face as well as a left one that had Tommy bewildered and not knowing where he was. Jackie paid no mind to the audience on their feet as they cheered so loud that the stadium would come down. She continued to hit Tommy with everything she had. She had hit him in his sides and in his face once more. A now drained and bleeding Tommy attempted to hit Jackie but ducked underneath, stood up and launched another left hit to Tommy's face. Yelling now, she launched punishment after punishment. 'I want you to feel what I feel everyday, Gunn! ' she thought. \"Don't you dare!\" Duke pointed. \"Don't you dare do this to me, boy!\" The crowd once again cheered Jackie's name. \"Jackie's ambushing Gunn like you wouldn't believe, Larry!\" the broadcaster replied excitedly. \"I think that may very well be what might happen here, Harry.\" his partner responded. The spirits of Apollo and Mickey now made themselves present beside Rocky and the rest and they looked on at Jackie's performance with promise. Apollo in particular, looked up at the dome where a ray of sunshine began to pour in. He looked back at Mickey, whom had placed his invisible hand on Rocky's shoulder, nodded back. Rocky looked up at the circular hole in the ceiling where he saw a small yellow ball that indicated it was the sun. ' Yo, hey, it's beautiful alright.. .' Rocky thought. \"That's right kid…the dark is being kicked out on its ass.\" He told him. It was the winning punch that Jackie gave to Tommy that knocked him down the ground. The crowd graduated from cheering to screaming with joy. The force of that very punch also sent Jackie to the ground. Both of them laid on the mat. \"Come on...Get up.\" Rocky whispered. \"She has to...\" Drago whispered as well. The referee counted as usual. Tommy sluggishly turned over but didn't find the strength to get up. Jackie on the ground breathed in and out and saw the sun. It was what put her in a kneeling position. She put her hands together and shook them. She then cried not in sadness but in happiness. The bell rung signaling that the fight was over. \"Holy crap!\" Paulie shouted with glee. Jackie had won. Getting up had been the hardest and painful. Jackie shook with excitement and also due to the catharsis. She felt something big and terrible had been over. It was done. A weight was lifted off her shoulders. Immediately she was bombarded with people who lifted her up in the air. Jackie looked down at the crowd while she raised her hands in victory. \"What! No! This can't be! This can't be!\" Duke repeated until he was met with a tomato thrown to his face. Laughter occurred all around. He was eventually knocked to the ground. Wiping the stains of tomato off his face, Duke eventually saw Gunn standing and looking down at him with no emotion. Duke raised a hand so that he could get up. Tommy simply scoffed and walked away leaving a disgraced Duke alone. In the ring, Rocky hugged a tearful Jackie who said to him. \"You won!\" \" You won, Jackie...\" Rocky said. \"You won at being the best trainer I ever had.\" she said. As he continued to embrace Jackie, Rocky thought he saw two other figures ahead. ' Could it be... ' And yes, yes it was. Author's Note: I'm extremely sorry that this took so long. I've just been busy working and working on other stories. There's one or two chapters after this. I'll try and update as soon as I can.

I know you're hurt but I promise you and this is something I know firsthand…\" Jackie listened intently. \"When you're through that final round of pain, it stops. It stops.\" Rocky nodded at the last part. Jackie nodded. She really believe that and yes, she took what she could get. Every time Rocky said something inspirational, it was like a burst of strength. Her adrenaline would spike up in a good way. She wished the broadcasters below the ring would be more encouraging. ' Thank you for that one. ' she thought. Her pain in her core was an unbearable one but since this was the last one, Jackie was going to go at Tommy with everything she had left. \"Larry, this is it. This is the moment. The final round. The one everyone in the city of Philadelphia is waiting for…\" the broadcaster Harry stated. \"Harry, the momentum is building up, it's skyrocketing. The whole stadium is in a delirium. The excitement is in the air like static electricity.\" \"This is what is coming down to. If Jackie wins, the city of Philadelphia will be left alone, if Tommy wins, Duke gets it.\" \"Oh man, Harry. My pulse is quickening over this.\" One could tell that everyone in the stadium was holding their breaths in. They were waiting for the outcome with great anticipation. The bell was about to ring and thus, would begin the final round. Rocky crossed his arms and looked content all of a sudden as he saw Rocky with her hands, ready to fight Tommy for what could be the last time. Behind him, Rocky saw the audience chanting someone's name. Two syllables. Rocky assumed it was his own name. But as he listened carefully, he figured out it was someone else's name. Not his. It was Jackie. There was no one else in the arena that the audience was going for. It was all for Jackie. \"Jackie! Jackie! Jackie!\" the crowd chanted as well as clapping. George Washington Duke folded his arms to his chest and merely rolled his eyes at the crowd, trying hard not to pay any attention to them. 'I know I'm gonna win. The crowd ain't gonna do squat to help her...' he thought. The crowd would not stop saying Jackie's name and it was getting to him now. Finally he had enough, Duke turned to Tommy and yelled. \"You better win this boy! Do you know what I would do to you, if you lose?\" A perplexed Tommy looked back at Duke and wondered why he had always been hard on him. Looking back at Jackie along with Rocky, Drago and Paulie at her side, he marveled as to how she had gotten this far. 'It was because of them...because of him. ' he thought. Rocky never led him to rich and fame. It was the absence of wealth that made Tommy frustrated with Rocky. Now that he had such resources, Tommy felt it wasn't worth it anymore. Thinking back, he realized something Rocky had said when he had been his manager. It had been before Tommy won the title. He and his girlfriend were in the car ready to head off to the stadium. Rocky had come up to talk to him before he left: 'Listen Tommy, we need to talk'. 'Later Rock.' No, no. listen Tommy. It's about Duke.' 'I'm 22 and 0. Where's the money? The way I was going. I wasn't going to get a shot of the title for a long time. I'm signing papers with the man tomorrow!' 'This is what Mick told me about. About the business, the dirty part of the business. These managers, when they represent these fighters, they promise them the world, then they, they suck' em dry, leave them, leave them in the gutter, broke Tommy!' 'This is what I'm talkin' about? You know Tommy? Duke. Duke, he's, he's like a vampire Tommy. He's living off of your blood Tommy.' 'I ain't you and you ain't Mick. When are you gonna realize that this is a business? In a business you need...' 'What? Brains? you say that I don't have any brains Tommy?' 'No. you said that, not me. Look, Rock. You took me as far as you could, but Duke gave my title shot, you didn't. If you still want to train me do it, but if you don't, don't. But it's my or it's the highway!' As soon as he stopped thinking about that incident, Tommy felt a wave of emotions weighing heavily on him. It had been sadness, regret, and sorrow. He began breathing heavily now. It was a revelation that was affecting him mentally and physically. He looked around at the arena where the audience continued to chant Jackie's name. No one had called out his name. Not one person. But at the same time, Tommy refused to believe that Jackie would win. He tried shaking off whatever doubts he had. The last thing he wanted was to get beaten by a girl twice. ' She's gonna hit the mat right now!' he thought. Growling like an angry lion and ready to attack, Tommy hopped up and down to amp himself. ' This is it, man. No turning back now… ' he told himself. Jackie felt very encouraged when she heard her name being called out by the crowd. It made her feel special. The thought that people thought of her as a beacon of hope, a force for good and a wondrous soul. As was read by one of the posters, it said. 'Wondrous Soul'. \"Duke's not getting this city...\" she whispered. With no more time to waste, the bell sounded and Jackie prepared for the last round of her life. No time to think anymore. The pair: Jackie and Tommy stared each other down. Both of them had waited a long time for the bell to ring an now both of them studied the other in an attempt at how he or she would pull off the first punch. It was nothing new. Jackie felt like another person. She fought a battle inside her at the same time she was fighting Tommy Gunn. ' I have to fight these fibers of doubt and despair. I have to hit them as hard as I can! ' she thought. Tommy came at her and sent out a punch to the side of her head, which she barely avoid. She hit back with a upper cut to Tommy's face. ' I have to fight to get rid of these past events that tried to hold me down...' she thought. Jackie yelled and drove herself and Tommy to the nearest corner, where with all her might hit Tommy in his core again and again. She tried hard not to get tired and relied on whatever energy reserves she had available. ' I have to fight to save a city that doesn't deserve to be driven down to the ground like I have... ' she thought. Gunn got out of the corner he was in and now began to fight ferociously but recklessly. He took Jackie's throat and dragged her back to the corner and now she was the one once again being pummeled. \"Yes! Yes! Knock her down! Take her down!\" Duke below bellowed out. Tommy stopped when the referee came and gave him a warning. He raised his arms in triumph to the crowd. The crowd immediately booed. Jackie held her core to stop the throbbing pain but raised her head upward to look at Tommy Gunn, who continued to be amazed at Jackie's persistence. \"It ain't over until it's over...\" she breathed out. The fight continued and Jackie had been met with a hit to his face which made her bleed from nose. Paying it no mind, she launched devastating right punches to Tommy's face as well as a left one that had Tommy bewildered and not knowing where he was. Jackie paid no mind to the audience on their feet as they cheered so loud that the stadium would come down. She continued to hit Tommy with everything she had. She had hit him in his sides and in his face once more. A now drained and bleeding Tommy attempted to hit Jackie but ducked underneath, stood up and launched another left hit to Tommy's face. Yelling now, she launched punishment after punishment. 'I want you to feel what I feel everyday, Gunn! ' she thought. \"Don't you dare!\" Duke pointed. \"Don't you dare do this to me, boy!\" The crowd once again cheered Jackie's name. \"Jackie's ambushing Gunn like you wouldn't believe, Larry!\" the broadcaster replied excitedly. \"I think that may very well be what might happen here, Harry.\" his partner responded. The spirits of Apollo and Mickey now made themselves present beside Rocky and the rest and they looked on at Jackie's performance with promise. Apollo in particular, looked up at the dome where a ray of sunshine began to pour in. He looked back at Mickey, whom had placed his invisible hand on Rocky's shoulder, nodded back. Rocky looked up at the circular hole in the ceiling where he saw a small yellow ball that indicated it was the sun. ' Yo, hey, it's beautiful alright.. .' Rocky thought. \"That's right kid…the dark is being kicked out on its ass.\" He told him. It was the winning punch that Jackie gave to Tommy that knocked him down the ground. The crowd graduated from cheering to screaming with joy. The force of that very punch also sent Jackie to the ground. Both of them laid on the mat. \"Come on...Get up.\" Rocky whispered. \"She has to...\" Drago whispered as well. The referee counted as usual. Tommy sluggishly turned over but didn't find the strength to get up. Jackie on the ground breathed in and out and saw the sun. It was what put her in a kneeling position. She put her hands together and shook them. She then cried not in sadness but in happiness. The bell rung signaling that the fight was over. \"Holy crap!\" Paulie shouted with glee. Jackie had won. Getting up had been the hardest and painful. Jackie shook with excitement and also due to the catharsis. She felt something big and terrible had been over. It was done. A weight was lifted off her shoulders. Immediately she was bombarded with people who lifted her up in the air. Jackie looked down at the crowd while she raised her hands in victory. \"What! No! This can't be! This can't be!\" Duke repeated until he was met with a tomato thrown to his face. Laughter occurred all around. He was eventually knocked to the ground. Wiping the stains of tomato off his face, Duke eventually saw Gunn standing and looking down at him with no emotion. Duke raised a hand so that he could get up. Tommy simply scoffed and walked away leaving a disgraced Duke alone. In the ring, Rocky hugged a tearful Jackie who said to him. \"You won!\" \" You won, Jackie...\" Rocky said. \"You won at being the best trainer I ever had.\" she said. As he continued to embrace Jackie, Rocky thought he saw two other figures ahead. ' Could it be... ' And yes, yes it was. Author's Note: I'm extremely sorry that this took so long.

They separated us the last time and we got really lucky to be brought back together at the detention center. Adonis was put in a holding cell because he was fighting some kid who talked about our mom. She died in a car crash. Our dad, well we never knew him. I was sitting in a small room with a book in my hand. Someone was wanting to see us. I didn't know who they were, but whatever they had to say I wouldn't go anywhere without my brother. The door opened and I looked up to see Gloria, one of the social workers. But behind her was a black woman. She was older, her hair in a tight bun, brown lipstick and light make up. Her eyes seemed to sparkle and she was in a night beige suit. She looked fancy. \" Hey Astrid. This is-\" but the woman held her hand up. \" Could you give us a moment?\" she asked lightly and the woman nodded. \" Of course.\" she replied and left the room. The door closed behind her and she just looked at me for a moment taking in my face. I looked her over some as well. \" Are you a social worker?\" I asked and she shook her head. \" No.\" she responded and I looked her over some. \" If you're going to take me to a group home, I won't go anywhere without my brother.\" I stated and she shook her head. \" I don't work for the state.\" she comments and moves closer to the table. I lean back some and look her face over more. She looks like she has soft skin. She pointed to the chair. \"May I?\" I didn't want to be rude and so I nodded. \" Sure.\" I replied and she smiled and slowly sat down in front of me. She eyed my book. \" What are you reading?\" she asked. I glanced at my thick paperback book and shrugged. \" Tales of the unwanted.\" I replied. She tilted her head. \" What is that about?\" she asked curiously. \" A man's daughter is kidnapped and he thinks she was taken by a murderer to be groomed as a killer. So he goes to great lengths to save her.\" I replied. Her eyes flexed with interest. \" They let you read that in here?\" she asked and I shrugged. \" I'm no stranger to the truths of this world. I just happen to have an interest in reading about the fictional portions of the hardships of life. In other words, yes they do.\" I answered and she nodded slowly, smiling genuinely now. \" Astrid… my name is Alicia. I am your father's sister.\" she replied. I stared at her with confused eyes not sure of how to take in her information. \" I don't know my father. For all I know I have no father.\" I answered. She gave me a mildly firm look. \" I know that. You and Adonis did not get to meet him when he was alive, but you did have a father. And he was quite the man.\" she replied. So, he was dead too. I looked down some taking in this realization. \" So why are you here?\" I asked, and she continued to smile. \" I want you and your brother to come live with me.\" she answered and I was stunned for a moment unsure of how to react. Her voice was melodic and her skin wasn't even wrinkled for an old woman. I licked my lips some. \" Why, don't you have any kids?\" I asked her and she chuckled some. \" Yes I do. I have one son. His name is Alexander. He's thirteen.\" She replies. I looked her over with skepticism. \" So why would you want to take in more kids?\" I asked pushing just a little bit. Her smile remained sweet as she looked me over. \" Because you both are my family, too.\" she responded. I looked her over some not sure if what she said was true. She seemed fancy, maybe she had money. Not like that mattered, but I didn't want just a home, I wanted a family. I looked at the table wondering if she's spoken to Adonis about this. But I was more interested in my father now. \" My father… what was his name?\" I asked gently… CREED Author's Notes BOOOM here is the sequel to Forbidden Temptation taking place in the Creed Universe specifically Creed 2 but will have characters from the Creed 1. I'm pretty sure I got Alexander's age correct since he was born in 1985 and the prologue of this chapter is 1998 making him 13. Anyways, I will make the alt. ending for Forbidden Temptation, but I just want to get the ball rolling on this fic. Anyways enjoy! Also I am waiting a few more weeks before I close the vote and start a new fic of what you have decided.[Chapter 2] 2 My brother had created his own destiny and has followed it even at the hesitation of our aunt. It destroyed her to see our father killed and now he decided to become a boxer as well. And he did it. He boxed his way to the top and I was there to see him rise to WBC World Heavyweight Championship. Now it was time for me to follow my dreams as well as an artist/photographer. I had my aunt's talent for photography and I also enjoyed painting and drawing. I traveled all over the world to the places my father has fought and photographed the stages, the parks and gyms that he trained in, the cemetery of which he was buried in. I had sold many art works and felt I was living the world I wanted for myself. I even went to country's my brother had his matches in as well. Kiev, Ukraine \"Pregnant… engaged, Bianca that is amazing! Congratulations on all of it. Plus you signed your record deal. Donnie must be thrilled.\" I replied walking in a large pink sweater and socks, my cell phone pressed to my ear. My apartment was small, but enough room for my art and my nice furniture. I moved outside for a moment on the balcony and looked down at the depressing ground at the Ukraine. Some guy is jogging with a truck following behind him. I was going to freeze my ass so I went back inside. \"I'm surprised he didn't tell you.\" she replied, and I shook my head sitting down at my table, a large blank note book in front of it. \"Oh Adonis, doesn't tell me much anymore. Ever since that fight we had over Conlan, I am not sure he is ready to forgive me yet.\" I replied. \"You're a grown woman, Astrid. You're allowed to do whatever you want and Donnie knows that.\" she said with confidence. Before I could start my sketches there was a knock at the door. \"Thanks, B. I have to go. I'll call you later.\" I replied. \"Okay. Take care of yourself.\" she replied. \"Yeah.\" I replied halfheartedly and hung up. I went over to the door and looked through the peep hole. I closed my eyes and sighed and looked down for a second before opening the door slowly. \"I thought I told you we could hang out when I was in Liverpool.\" I replied opening the door more to show the full form of Ricky Conlan. He shrugged casually. \"I couldn't stay away. I heard you were in Kiev, so I thought I would stop by. You know surprise you… what are you even doing here in Kiev?\" he said. \"You heard? Are you following me Mr. Conlan?\" I asked and he casually shook his head. \"Nah. Just keeping up with your magazines and your art work. Can I come in?\" he asked. I stared at him for a bit longer opening the door. In only thirty minutes, I was on my hands and knees on my bed. The headboard knocked against the wall, while Ricky rammed into me from behind. \"Fuck!\" he growls out as he lifts my leg for better access. My moans and whimpers fill the room as I feel his cock hitting me deeper and deeper. \"Oh god!\" I cried out in utter bliss. When I visited him at his apartment, usually I'd be the first to get dressed after our heated romps. But when he visited, he took his time. I guess it showed who was more attached. We stared at the ceiling, my blankets covering our lower halves. \"Why don't you come stay with me in Liverpool?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"We've talked about this.\" I said with a sigh and he shook his head. \"No you said no. We didn't even talk about this.\" he said. I shrugged. \"Because there is nothing to discuss. You have your life with your children and wife.\" \"Ex-wife.\" he said and I shook my head. \"You should not have up and left her like you did.\" I said sitting up now and he sat up as well. \"We both knew I wasn't happy with her. She knew we weren't going to make it.\" he said raising his hand to caress my cheek. \"You just helped confirmed it for me.\" Yeah I had a real bad habit fucking the guys my brother has fought in the ring. First it was Leo, Sporino, Danny Wheeler, and now Ricky. I guess that was what I got for living in my brother's shadows for so long. He fought men. I fucked them. After Ricky got dressed and I led him to the door, he stopped in the door way and looked at me. \"Just think about it?\" he asked. I inhaled some and nodded. \"Okay.\" I replied and he smiled and leaned down kissing me lightly before heading out. I closed the door and locked it before pressing my back to the door and groaning some and running my fingers through my hair. I noticed I didn't answer his question about why I was really here. I had little apartments in certain places where I did my business. Plus, Adonis would soon be here to challenge some boxer. I didn't know his name, but Rocky made me promise to be there for the fight. He and Aunt Alicia would be there, so I said I would too. 3 Days Later-Back in America- Los Angeles Alicia's POV After getting off the phone with Rocky, I couldn't help but be filled with emotions. He came to Adrian's Restaurant and actually spoke to him. After all these years. I shook my head placing my hands on my vanity table. I couldn't believe his son was challenging Adonis. I haven't seen him, but if he was like his father, I feared for my nephew. A slight knock on my door made my head lift so I had to face myself in the mirror. I had a long braid that hung over the shoulder of my robe. A few curls stuck out. \"Come.\" I replied. It was Delores, one of my maids. \"Ms. Creed. There is a…gentleman here to see you.\" she said and I could tell she looked a bit nervous. I knew he was here. It wasn't a secret that I lived in my brother's house and had taken over his affairs. When I didn't answer she nodded. \"I will send him away.\" \"No. It's alright.\" I replied and left my room after tightening my robe. I moved from my room and down the hall. It's such a glorious all, even at night. Portraits of my family were above each sconce and it was like walking through history. First it was of our parents and Apollo and I when we were young. Then it was of us as teenagers, then he and Mary Ann. Another was of Alexander and I. He had joined the military when he was eighteen and was in Afghanistan. A soldier like his father. Last were pictures of me with Adonis and Astrid. They are so beautiful, my family. My children. I moved down the stairs and over to the door. Slowly I opened it, and his large form slowly turned to face me and now we were both standing here. 30 years older yet right now all time seemed to have stood still.[Chapter 3] 3 He had definitely aged, his hair swooping down some over his forehead. Even through his wrinkles, I could still see the strapping man I once knew. But his eyes. Those eyes I was unfamiliar with. Even when they looked at me with surprise and awe. He was in a black jacket and pants. I would be lying if I said I didn't expect him to be in uniform. \"Licia.\" he replied breathlessly. I slowly smiled never thinking I would hear him say my name again. \"Hello, Ivan.\" I replied gently and he slowly took a step closer, maybe to look at me in the porch light's dim rays. He still towered over me. I was unsure of what to say or what to do. I didn't expect to see him here. He slowly looked at my shoulder and gently began to lean into me. I just watched as his forehead nuzzled slowly into my shoulder. His scent washed over me reminding me of the days of passion that was once between us. I let out a gentle exhale and closed my eyes as I leaned my head into his finally and raised my arms to wrap around his neck. I felt his arms enclose around me and pull me into him. I could feel my eyes watering slowly, but I held back the tears as I felt his face pulling back to look at me. He was so close, and I didn't know what he would do next until I felt his lips gently press into mine. I felt like a young girl again. I responded immediately. I had missed his lips so very much. I invited him inside and his eyes looked all around the place as he entered the middle of the room. \"Quite a step up from Colorado.\" he said, and I just stood in front of him for a moment looking down some. I hadn't thought of that day for quite some time. \"My sister… Apollo's wife, died in a car crash the day of your fight with Rocky.\" I replied. His eyes softened some as he tucked his hands in his pockets. \"That is why you were not there in the end.\" he said. I nodded. \"They left me this home.\" I replied. He nodded gently. \"I am sorry for your loss.\" he said and now crossed his arms and looked away. I could see the soft traces of bitterness in his eyes. \"I can see why you broke things off. You needed to… focus on yourself.\" I tilted my head and shook it slowly. \"No. I didn't break anything off-\" \"Lies.\" he snapped lowly giving me a glare. I inhaled some and gave a firm stare of my own. \"I am not lying.\" I replied. \"We made deal. We write to each other. I wrote you countless letters. You never replied.\" he said, his tone laced with so much hurt. I shook my head stepping closer to him but he took a step back now as if not wanting to hear it. \"Ivan… I never received any of your letters. And any letter I received were my own just returned to me. \"I don't want to hear any more of your lies.\" he said shaking his head. \"Do you believe after thirty years, I would truly not speak to you!\" I snapped. \"YES!\" he shouted. One of my body guards in a black suit approached from the hall way upon hearing the yelling. \"Ms. Creed, do I need to throw him out?\" he asked. Ivan turned to him with a glare, his hands curling into fists. \"You can try.\" he threatened. But I stood between the two men. \"Enough! No, Roman. I am perfectly fine.\" I replied before glaring up at Ivan who was just staring down at the smaller man. My voice was softer now. \"Come with me.\" I walked around him and back over to the stairs. He began to follow after me and when we were at the top, I moved in the direction of my room. I had to show him I wasn't lying. Once I reached the door of my room, I turned to look at Ivan to see him staring at a particular portrait. I already knew which one. I slowly walked over to him and looked at his emotional eyes. He stared at Alexander in his uniform as I was seated in a wine-red chair in a black dress. It was sleeves, it's bust heart shaped. Ivan just stood there taking in the portrait. \"You… got married?\" he asked softly, and I looked at the picture and shook my head. \"No.\" I replied, and he looked down at me now with a look of deep surprise. \"He is…\" I slowly nodded. \"Yes. This is Alexander Ivan Creed. Your son.\" I replied and his chest puffed out with his sharp inhale. He slowly covered his mouth with his hand. Alexander had his jaw, his height and my eyes. His hair was straight and his skin smooth and caramel complexioned. \"He is a soldier?\" he asked and I nodded. \"Yes. Like his father.\" I replied and took his hand. He looked at me, blue eyes watering as I led him slowly from his spot and to my room. \"Why did you not tell me?\" he asked softly. I moved over to one of my dressers now and removed a large stack of unopened letters bound together by a rubber band. I moved back over to him and held up the stack. \"I sent these to you. In them are ultrasounds and pictures of your son and I.\" I replied. His eyes looked at my hands with pain as he slowly reached down and took them. He held the stack between his body and hugged them to him. \"You never got a single letter?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"Not a single one.\" I replied. \"Maybe your wife found them and mailed them back. If anything, I am happy she decided not to destroy them.\" He shook his head. \"I lost wife long ago. In my letters, I wrote that I lost everything: titles, home, respect. Even more I lost you and my son. And it is all because of Rocky.\" His saddened eyes now glossed over to anger and he turned and began to leave my room. I was worried now as I followed. \"Ivan-\" \"I will make this right.\" he said. Even as an older man he was able to walk with great purpose. I followed him down the stairs. \"You plan to use your son against my nephew.\" I said and he paused at the bottom of the stairs and I just remained at the top. \"That is not the way. Hatred will never be the way.\" He didn't even face me as he quickly stormed out with my letters in hand. A week later Astrid's POV I watched the rain fall from the living room. Since I would be here for a while, I figured I should start looking for places to take pictures. Maybe the building my brother will be fighting in. I checked my phone and saw there were no calls from him. I got dressed in some jeans and a sweater. I put my rain coat over me and grabbed my green bag which contained my extra umbrella and my camera. I slid on my rainboots, grabbed my giant umbrella from the corner and headed out. I exited the complex and put my hood on. The rain wasn't heavy but it was coming down fast. I merely walked up the street, just following the side walk. There was a construction site up ahead and I made sure not to walk in any restricted areas. But it did match the gloomy type of setting I was looking for. I continued to walk until I was approaching a large set of apartments that went straight up. I saw someone sitting down on the side walk in front of me and I was familiar with the grey hoodie. It must be that guy who is always jogging around here. He was looking down with his hands atop of his head. He looked almost… defeated. I didn't plan to do anything about him as I past but he looked like he may need some type of motivation. I stopped in front of him but he didn't seem to notice me. So I merely moved my umbrella over his shaved head and the lack of rain over his head got his attention. He looked up at me. He had deep brown eyes and looked at me confused. I just stared at him and he just stared up at me. I inhaled finally and jiggled the umbrella at him. \"You run a lot around here. If you run in the rain and get sick, it'll be even harder to work out.\" I replied. He looked me over and I could tell he was mildly reserved. Maybe he didn't speak English. How rude of me to come to his country and not speak his language. \" Take it.\" I replied. Now he seemed stunned. Maybe because I could speak his language. He raised his hand and I could tell how he lifted it that there was pure muscle under his hoodie. His hand was large and before it could over my hand entirely, I removed my hand. I hurried and dug into my bag and pulled out my other umbrella and opened it. Once that was done I looked down at the man before shrugging. \"If you want to throw it away later you can.\" I replied. He just blinked and looked at me like a lost puppy almost. I looked around noticing I wasn't going to get much out of him. So I nodded. \"Good bye.\" I merely turned and began to walk back toward my apartment. \"Thank you.\" I heard his deep, thick accent say in English. I turned and looked at him and smiled politely and nodded and continued on.[Chapter 4] 4 When I returned home, I took a hot shower and just read White Oleander on my Ipad. I've seen the movie too. Michael Pfiffer and Allison Loman really painted a picture between the toxic relationship of Ingrid and Astrid Magnussen. I think my mother named me after her. But who is to know. My cell rang and I saw it was my aunt. I smiled and answered. \"Hey Aunt Alicia, what's going on?\" I asked. \"Oh nothing much. I was just calling to see how you were. LA is abuzz about your brother's fight with this Viktor Drago and I just wanted to know if you wanted to talk.\" she replied. I shrugged nonchalantly. \"Nothing to talk about.\" I replied. \"You sure? You know it's not good to bottle things up.\" she replied. \"I'm fine.\" I replied. Maybe because I was in the Ukraine and she was worried about hostility toward me by others if they knew who I was. \"Alright then. I am flying in tomorrow with plans of touring The Bohdan and Varvara Khanenko National Museum of Arts. Some of my work is displayed there. Would you like to come with me?\" she asked. My eyes immediately sparkled, for she was my motivation to go into art and photography as a child. Spending any time with her since she adopted us gave me nothing but joy. \"Sure, that sounds good!\" I said with a smile. \"Wonderful. I'll let you know when I land. I'll come pick you up.\" she said. \"Alright.\" I replied and we hung up. There was a hard knock on the door, yet it seemed restrained if that made sense. I looked up thinking no one should be here. I hurried and threw on my pink sweater and came to the door. I opened it and had to immediately look up to see it was the guy from earlier. He stood at 6'4 and was in a black hoodie and matching pants. \"What are you doing here?\" I immediately asked with suspicion keeping the door closed and he opened his mouth some and then closed it dumbly. \"I followed you… so I could return umbrella later.\" he said holding up my umbrella and I looked at it and then back at him. \"It's later.\" I blinked some and realized this was a very big man, able to burst through my door if he wanted. \"You could have thrown it away.\" I said and he nodded. \"It… looks like a nice umbrella.\" he said and I slowly reached my hand through the door and he held it up to me causally. I quickly grabbed it and fumbled to get it back into the door. \"Thanks.\" I replied going to close the door. \"My name is Viktor.\" he said hurriedly causing me to pause some and look up at him confused. He looked down the hall as if expecting someone to see someone. He looked back down at me with a stunned gaze and I nodded. \"Hello… I'm Astrid.\" I replied and he nodded. \"Astrid.\" he answered lowly and looked the ground over for answers. \"I've never had someone do something nice for me.\" I arched a brow now. \"It's just an umbrella.\" I replied and he nodded tucking his hands in his hoody. \"Yes I now that. But still.\" he said and suddenly pulled something out and held it up to me as if it were a bouquet of flowers. But instead it was a small square piece of paper and I tilted my head. \"If you are not busy tomorrow night, I would be honored if you would come see me fight.\" My brain went completely dead and it took a few seconds to reboot so I could understand what he had just asked me. \"You a fighter or something?\" I asked and he nodded. \"A boxer. I plan to be champion someday. Maybe… we could… do something after match.\" he said and thought about his words. Knowing I had fighters in my blood line made me somewhat drawn to him. I was curious of how this fighter saw the world through his eyes. I slowly reached out my hand and gently took the ticket from him. I felt the side of his hand as I reached for it. For it being so cold, he was very warm. He gave a soft half smile. \"I will go.\" I replied and he nodded. \"I see you there.\" he said before turning and moving down the hall giving a childish sort of wave as he left. I looked down at the ticket before looking up with a smile and closing the door. \"A fighter you say.\" Aunt Alicia commented with interest as we sat in the back of her car. \"It was just a kind gesture. I'm sure it's just a small-time brawl or something.\" I replied and she smirked. \"Nothing is ever as it seems in the Creed family.\" she replied. She was in a nice leather print suit with her hair pinned back in a nice bun. She wore the same neutral make up she's been wearing for years. I looked her over some. \"Auntie, can I ask you a question?\" I asked noticing she was staring out the window of the car with a kind of longing stare. She looked at me. \"Hm?\" she asked. I shrugged. \"Why didn't you ever get married to Alexander's father?\" I asked. Her smile dipped back some and I could tell I had brought up a memory that may have been a bit too painful. She sighed some and pat my right leg covered by my black stocking. \"Well truth be told I was in love with a soldier. But we were from different worlds and the worlds weren't ready for our type of relationship.\" I replied. I tilted my head some. \"He was white.\" I assumed and she nodded. It wasn't a big surprise. Alexander was clearly mixed. \"I figured it'd be bad in the 30s and 40s but not the 80s.\" I replied and she nodded. \"It wasn't our skin color that was the problem… it was our titles.\" she said in a story telling type tone. I tilted my head. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. She hummed softly. \"Oh, being related to your father meant not dating certain people in his life. I was seeing someone in his life and it was quite dangerous to do so, even though that person did something very terrible.\" she replied. Her tone deepened some and I could tell something was weighing heavy on her mind and maybe even her spirit. \"What did he-\" but she held her hand up closing her eyes and shaking her head. \"Let's not fester on the past, but look toward the bright future ahead. Now tell me about this mystery fighter.\" she said. I didn't want to upset her so I shrugged. \"I don't know him. It was raining yesterday so I gave him one of my umbrellas and he returned it and invited me out.\" I replied. She nodded slowly. \"Hm not usual method of courting, but all I can say is just be safe. If you want, I can put a tail on him to make sure you're being watched.\" she said and I shook my head. \"I will be just fine auntie.\" I replied and she nodded. \"Alright.\" We arrived at the museum and was greeted by the curator who met my aunt with open arms. The day was completely ours. We walked the halls of the museum looking at sculptures and portraits. We got to see some of Aunt Alicia's. They were grand forms of pointillism and some were paintings of the wilderness. It gave the feeling you were actually there. That's what made my aunt's work so popular. The pictures she took, the paintings she created made you feel something deep in your soul. \"Have you spoken to your brother?\" she asked and I shook my head. \"No. He won't return any of my calls and so I have stopped trying.\" I replied and she pouted some. \"It hurts me to see you both fighting. Twins are not as powerful when they are against each other.\" she explained and I sighed. \"I can't apologize enough.\" I said with guilt and she gave me a sharp look. \"You never should have apologized in the first place. You slept with men like it is your human nature and because they had a history with your brother, he got mad. He's going to have to learn that his sister is a grown woman.\" she said. I didn't feel that way. \"You have no idea how many times I have covered for him to sneak girls in to his room at night.\" I replied. She laughed out loud. \"Oh I knew every girl he snuck in and out. Ya'll weren't fooling anyone. Alexander did the exact same thing.\" she said before sighing melodically. She wrapped an arm around my shoulder. \"I'm sure this fighter will have nothing to do with your brother.\" After our tour, Aunt Alicia dropped me off at home. We shared a hug, she put a few twenties in my wallet, kissed my cheek good bye and we parted. That night I slid on my leggings, a black sweater, and a black leather jacket. I braided my hair back loosely and tied it with a rubber band. I slid on my black boots and headed out the door. I got in my car and put in the GPS directions that were on the ticket. What did I have to lose? I mean auntie was right. This guy had nothing to do with my brother. Author's note So when I watched Creed it seemed like Viktor looked kinda shy sometimes when he wasn't glaring or trying to look intimidating. I can imagine his father didn't teach him much about girls or even women as he matured from boy to man. All he knows is fighting so I am making him shy and curious in the first few chapters until things get heated with them and then that all melts away. Until next time![Chapter 5] 5 The building wasn't grand, but the parking lot was filled completely. I walked inside and handed a man in a black suit my ticket. He gave me a look over with tired eyes before handing me another small piece of paper. \" Row 3 seat 11.\" he said in a thick tone. I nodded and just floated with numerous others down the brightly lit hall until we were in the arena. There were a few lights in the ceiling and a large ring surrounded by chairs. I found my chair and sat down. I noticed the room was filling up moderately fast. I'd like to think I had a good seat. Not too far, not too close. I remember Adonis would be going to underground fighting rings all over Mexico, slowly building his way to the top. He didn't like me being there during those fights. They were sketchy, and he constantly felt he had to watch me to make sure no one bothered me. I understood. I noticed some guys a few rows back near the aisles watching me with intent like eyes. Maybe they were wondering what I was doing here in the sea of white faces. Did I really stand out that much? The quiet room is filling with chatter and excitement and I saw someone now moving toward the ring. A man who stood at about six-feet and had a small crew of guys following him. He must have been the fighter and the rest, his training crew. The crowd clapped and out of respect I clapped too. Two old guys were on either side of me, so I felt mildly safe that I wouldn't be bothered. Once the guy was in the ring it was maybe fifteen seconds until Viktor began to walk down the aisle with only one man behind him. He was old with sad, pale blue eyes. His graying hair swept over his face. He's in a red jumpsuit. Only one trainer? That was noticeable. Adonis came out alone during his fights. He had no one to train him before Uncle Rocky came into his life. Viktor was massive, veiled in a silver robe that was rimmed with black lining. His gloves, black and dangerous. The crowd cheered a bit heavier for him and I just curled my fingers and watched intently. My stomach was tightening a bit with nervousness. I didn't have the stomach for fighting, let alone watching it. But I swallowed my weakness when Adonis asked me to come to more of his fights once he grew popular and word got out that Apollo Creed's twin children have come out of the woodwork. It amazed people seeing us together, Apollo's spitting images. My thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of the bell. By now Viktor and the other nameless fighter were bare and approaching each other with their gloves up. I immediately noticed his body, which I didn't feel bad for noticing. I had felt he had muscle beneath the sleeve of his hoody when I first met him, and now my thoughts were right. He was perfectly sculpted. I bet I would break my hand on his tight stomach. I watched the smaller fighter throw some punches at Viktor's stomach. He didn't even look phased. His once curious eyes were now focused and hard. He wanted to win. He danced around the ring with the other man before suddenly throwing a punch to the face. That was it for him. After two more punches the man was down on the ground. I noticed Viktor's trainer smirking with toxic pride. He looked like some bad guy right out of a comic book. I can picture him as a mobster, maybe soldier who came back from war and wanted to take over his entire community. The match didn't last long, which I suspected the second Viktor came out. He seemed to have way more power than the other guy. He merely stalked the guy from his corner pacing around like a predator waiting for him to get up. \" 5…6…7…8…9…10!\" the referee finished and now everyone was cheering again. He had won. But he did not throw his gloves to the air or gloat. He looked almost disappointed that his opponent didn't get up. He started to eye the ring looking directly in my direction. Maybe he knew where I would be sitting since he did buy the ticket. I lifted my head up thinking he would see me and after a few seconds, he did. Our eyes locked and I could see that shy look in his eyes again. He seemed surprised like he didn't expect for me to be here maybe. He gave a slight nod, before his trainer regained his attention. He patted his back and whispered something to him. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wait for him or not. No one seemed to be getting up and the two fighters began to disperse from the ring. I watched Viktor leave down the aisle. After forty minutes, two new fighters were beginning to walk down the aisle. The cheering grew once more, so I took that as my cue to leave. I guess it wasn't meant to happen. I left out into the hallway and made my way back to the front doors. My keys were in my hand already ready as I moved out into the cold. As I was looking around for my car, I noticed a figure approaching me swiftly. I gasped and jumped back giving a small yelp. The figure pulled the hood off their head, and I saw it was Viktor. His skin face was mildly red as if scolded by hot water. \"Jesus what the hell!\" I snapped angrily, and he raised his hands, eyes immediately showing guilt. \"Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.\" he said. His voice sounded stressed, and I looked him over before clutching my chestly. I could smell water and soap on his body. He must have showered right after his match. \"What's wrong with you? You won your fight, and you look all mopey.\" I said. He shook his head and looked away. I knew that face though. He didn't just get into a fight. He got into an argument as well with someone. \"My dad… we got into it.\" he said in a low, annoyed tone. \"The guy who's in your corner?\" I asked, and he nodded. \"Da.\" he replied, and I tilted my head. \"What about?\" I asked. He motioned his wide forehead toward me. \"I told him I wanted to hang out with you and he yelled.\" he replied, and I scoffed gently. \"You're a grown man. You can do what you want.\" I replied, and he nodded. \"I know he thinks you're a distraction. If I stay out late, I won't be able to train tomorrow.\" he said. Yes. The man who was running every day for hours on end. \"There's nothing wrong with taking a break.\" I replied. He gave a humorous scoff. \"Break, what even is word?\" he asked trying to be funny which it worked. I smiled lightly and looked around the parking lot. \"You come here with him?\" I asked. He nodded and sighed. \"Da. He says I can find my own way home.\" he said. Boy he sounds like a douche. But hell, he looked like one too. The Russian villain. I nodded slowly noticing the wind was cold against my face causing me to tense up. Our conversation seemed to be dying and so I decided to make it weirder. \"Want to come back to my place. I can show you some of my work or something. Unless you want to actually go somewhere.\" I offered. He visibly leaned back some looking surprised once more, but he just nodded. I smiled and motioned for him to follow me to my car. I drove a 2017 Nissan Altima. \"Nice car.\" he motioned as we got in and I shrugged. \"Thanks.\" I replied and pushed the Start button beside the wheel. I took off from the parking lot, the warmth of the car made me feel better. Now it was saturated with both our body scent. \"I have never been in a car so nice. You rich or something?\" he asked. I bit the inside of my cheek as I focused on the road. \"My father was a very popular and successful boxer. I didn't know him though. My twin and I were adopted by his sister after he and his wife passed. They left her all their money and possessions. She raised us. I went on to paint and become a successful photographer traveling the world making art in the places my father had boxed.\" I explained. \"Long story short I got lucky and continued to find and earn my own success.\" I didn't want to bring up Adonis. I didn't want him taking over the conversation. Viktor looked impressed and nodded. \"That's amazing.\" he said. I shrugged. \"I'm thankful for what I have, and the opportunities given to me.\" I replied before glancing at him. \"What about you? You have always wanted to fight?\" I got no reply and as I drove under street lamps, I glanced at Viktor to see him looking out in the distance with bitterness. \"Not always. I mean I showed potential as a child and my father has trained me ever since. That's how my life is. Wake up, run, train, sleep.\" he said, his voice low and heavy. I bit the side of my lip with uncertainty. \"And your mother?\" I asked, and he shrugged. \"Never knew her really. She left my father and left me with him.\" he said. I nodded slowly. He didn't seem to have much in his life or at least he wasn't given the space to think for himself and grow. It made me wonder about his parents and who they were, but I didn't feel it was my place to ask. \"How did you and twin end up in foster home?\" he asked. I thought back to my mother. Fair skin, somewhat oily, but still beautiful under the sun. Her long hair was honey brown and she had dark, mysterious eyes. \"She died.\" I replied flatly and inhaled some. \"My brother and I were put into foster care when we were young. Then my aunt found us and took us in.\" Viktor seemed very focused on my face. It made my body warm to have such attention and I liked it. Everyone wants to feel either wanted or needed. I liked being wanted. I pulled up into the parking lot of my complex and we both got out. Viktor scanned the building from top to bottom as he got out. \"I've run by this place every day for months. How long have you been here?\" he asked. I shrugged walking around the front of my car. \"A month or so. My father never fought here, but a friend of his did. I have a project I am working on and will be here for a few months.\" I replied. And my brother is coming to fight someone here as well and I have decided, that even though we aren't talking, to support him and see his match. But I didn't want him to know that I came from a boxing family. I wanted people to know me and whatever legacy I had decided for myself. \"Do you have any work out in museums?\" he asked following me inside the complex. We were now walking through the atrium. The young woman behind the checkout desk, eyed Viktor immediately. \"Yes.\" I replied stepping through the door and walking up the stairs. \"Are they good?\" he asked. I glanced back at him to see the curiosity filled in his eyes. He looked as if he knew nothing except fighting, except knocking people out. It's like he's programmed or something. Once his dad hits the button he cuts on and fights, but when he's done, he's in some kind of standby mode. How much did he know about people and women and social cues and norms? I shrugged. \"I'll let you be the judge of that.\" I replied coolly and guided him to the second floor. I wondered how far he was when we first met, when he followed me back here. I never even knew he had. Maybe that was a bad thing if I wasn't alert to him. We made it to the top of the second floor and I led him down the hall. Viktor's POV She'd probably think of me as some pervert or stalker if she knew I had followed her once before. Not to try and hurt her, but to talk to her and stare at her beautiful face some more. When I was running, I would see her sitting on her balcony in leggings and sweaters on the phone. Her hair was normally pinned up and or down and pulled back a bit. I tried ignoring her before, but once I saw her stressed out on her balcony. I was immediately concerned and slowed my running just a bit to stare at her. My dad nearly ran me over. I was sure he would have done it had I not looked back in time to see him still driving at the same speed from when I started. He always followed me, like my shadow. I was happy to be able to lose him enough in the rain. So I had time to sit and think and just be in my head for a minute blocking out all the other noise around me. The rain was cool on my head and I could finally figure out what I was doing with my life. The water was nice and something I actually liked, and I didn't like much in my life. But as the rain stopped above my head, I was almost annoyed. My dad was here probably to scold me for stopping. But once I looked up and saw her there, I felt my tiny one-person bubble expand and immediately suck her into my world. And now here we both are, together in the night. I already told myself that whatever she wanted I would give her. I could already tell she didn't care about titles or riches. She didn't discuss her brother. Maybe he was popular and, in the media, but she wanted to be her own person. I'm so infatuated by her, I knew I would do whatever she wanted me to. Finally, here we are at her apartment. She unlocks her door and invites me into her world.[Chapter 6] 6 Astrid's pov I walked through the door stepping aside so Viktor could follow, a small stream of light could be seen from my lamp on the glass end table beside my couch. I never liked coming home to complete darkness if I could help it. I held the door open and watched as he looked around the place quizzically, as if walking through a maze himself. I closed the door and turned to see him already staring at one of my paintings called The Silver Night. Silver waves danced across the top of the page devoured by darkness at the bottom. \"I had a dream that I had been floating in darkness with silver above my head. I was walking on dirt that was so hot, my brain told me I was in Africa.\" I explained standing beside him, with a few inches of space between our bodies. Viktor looked down at me. He was like a giant. \"You have been to Africa?\" he asked, and I just shook my head. \"No.\" I replied. The mind is a mysterious thing when you're asleep. I gave him a quick tour of my place, his eyes darting from numerous photos and paintings that were organized neatly on my walls. It seemed pointless hanging paintings up in places I wasn't permanently living in. But I liked Kiev, so I would always pay the rent here even if I was staying in America or somewhere. I would have led him out onto the balcony, but I could see the snow dancing in the wind. It was beautiful, but icy cold. My tour ended with the kitchen. \"Want anything to eat?\" I asked. \"I have tons of stuff I could make.\" But he shook his head. \"Thank you, but I am fine… did you like my fight?\" he asked instead, and I gave a polite smile. \"It was quick.\" I replied honestly. He nodded, giving the same look of disappointment to the space beside my head. \"Yes it was.\" he answered, and I leaned against my counter top. \"But you did great.\" I replied, and he gave half a smirk and nodded. \"Thank you for showing up.\" he said with a genuine tone, and I nodded back. \"Thank you for inviting me.\" I replied, finally peeling off my coat and walking around him and back to my room. \"I'm going to get out of these clothes. Feel free to channel surf or raid my pantry.\" \"Da… thank you.\" he called. I didn't know why I was so nervous. Maybe it was because someone new was in here. Not my family, not Billy, someone completely new. I pulled on an ocean blue sweater and black sweats. I hung the rest of my clothes back up and moved back into the living room. I expected Viktor to have taken up my offers on food and entertainment, but he didn't. He was looking at my largest portrait on the wall beside the couch. The Giver, it's called. It was the silhouette of a woman large from pregnancy. She was looking down, her arms caressing her stomach as if the baby was in her arms. Her hair was vibrant and swaying around her like water and her arms were covered in stretch marks and scars from her youth. She has endured much, and she has given so much in return. She has changed to bring her child into the world. I noticed Viktor's hoodie was off and hanging off the arm rest of my couch. He was in a black Under Armour shirt and pants. I stood beside him. His eyes looked mesmerized by the art. \"Who is this woman?\" he asked softly, and I looked at it. \"She's the giver, the woman who sacrifices, who gives her love unconditionally. She's everyone's mother.\" I commented lowly. \"You make this?\" he asked as if not believing it, and I nodded softly. \"Yes.\" I replied almost childlike, and he just stared up at it some more. \"Beautiful.\" he said with a nod of approval. \"Like you.\" I glanced up at him, noticing how dark and deep his eyes looked in the dim light. My chest tightened, and I cleared my throat and looked away. \"Thanks.\" I replied gently. Oh what was I thinking, bringing him here when I knew I wouldn't know what to do with him, what we could do here together. \"Will you draw me?\" he asked, and I glanced up at him again and tilted my head. \"What, like right now?\" I asked, and he nodded like an excited kid. His eyes knew just how to project the emotions he was feeling. That honestly sounded like a good idea and would definitely quell the warm feelings growing between my legs. I nodded slowly. \"Okay.\" I replied and motioned toward the couch and he nodded, and we separated. I moved to the room to grab my sketch book out of my close, and he sat on the couch. He was so large, his form quickly dipped into the cushion. I came back out with my large line-less book and sat across from him. I stared at him for a moment before getting the image in my head of how I would draw him. He seemed to match my gaze, his eyes tracing every inch of my face. He also straightened up as if posing for me. I began sketching soft lines at the top of my book. \"So, tell me about your father?\" I asked. He looked stunned now. \"You don't need me to be still?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"Movement doesn't hinder me.\" I replied. He blinked in surprise before nodding. \"My father is… tough man. He was a soldier, a boxer.\" he said. I nodded and continued my sketch. \"Do you have siblings?\" I asked. \"No. Only child.\" he replied. \"What about you, artist who paints beautiful picture. You have brother, but you not speak of him. Why?\" His question didn't make me pause for dramatic effect or cause me to frown. \"At the moment he and I are not speaking. We got into a fight.\" I replied. \"What you fight about?\" he asked with a tilt of his head, but he quickly straightened back up again as if not wanting to mess me up. \"He has trouble accepting the fact that I am a grown woman and can be with whoever I want.\" I replied, and he tilted his head, eyes curious. \"Like women?\" he asked, and now I had to pause my sketching, so I didn't mess up on his sensual eyes. I laughed hard shaking my head. He looked away somewhat bashfully and I calmed myself a bit. \"No.\" I replied before continuing my drawing. \"So you like men then?\" he asked, almost sounding hopeful and I nodded. \"Yes.\" I replied and kept sketching him. He scratched the side of his head laughing with embarrassment. \"So you want to be a champion huh?\" He nodded, his eyes bright now. \"Yes. I WILL be champion.\" he stated, and I tilted my head as I kept sketching his jaw. \"Why do you want to be a champion?\" I asked. \"Because it is what I have always wanted.\" he said. Really? Is it really what you always wanted? Or is someone controlling your shadow and living through you? \"I want to be known. Seen. I want the world to know my name forever.\" I simply nodded. The great and powerful Viktor blank. I felt I should ask his last name, but I wanted to stay in the dark. I liked not knowing. It still made us strangers to only know so little. \"I understand.\" I replied. Now we sat in silence and I continued my sketch smiling some at how good the picture was turning out. His eyes in the picture matched his eyes completely: curious and unknowing. \"What is it?\" he asked, and I smiled. \"Nothing. I just think you'll like the picture is all.\" I said. He nodded with a light smile. \"I don't have many pictures of myself.\" he said suddenly, and I looked at him a bit saddened by this. \"Well everyone should have a picture of them in their home.\" I said. \"You've never seen my home.\" he pointed out. I focused more on drawing him then the couch and the furniture in the back ground. They were all light and almost white and he himself was focused and sharp. Once I felt done enough, I gently tore the page out of the book making sure not to ruin it. Viktor leaned forward almost immediately once he saw what I was doing. I sat up on my knees and leaned forward a bit toward him and handed him the paper. He followed my actions, sitting up and leaning in to me a bit as he took the paper. He looked almost amazed and this made me happy. I didn't think I had drawn his beard too dark, or his eyebrows too long, or his nose too big. His black clothes were lightly sketched and filled in, but I managed to get the Under Armour logo just right at the bottom hem of his shirt. If anything, I wanted to focus on his face and body which I think I nailed. \"You are really talented.\" he said looking down at me, and I smiled. \"Thanks. It's yours if you want. Or I can throw it away.\" I said casually, but he shook his head. \"No. I don't think I will.\" he said. It sounded like a promise and I smiled leaning toward him to look at my work. \"Well good. I am glad you like it.\" I replied. \"Astrid?\" he asked lightly. \"Hm?\" I asked not really hearing him now. \"May I kiss you?\" he asked, his voice soft and curious. I looked up at him slowly, his eyes now glazed over with dark hues that immediately brought that feeling back into my body. I wasn't expecting him to ask. Ricky would just lean in for the kiss, devouring me, destroying my lips like he was destroying one of his opponents in the ring. I didn't want to be someone's opponent. I wondered if Viktor wanted an opponent. There was only one way to find out. We looked at each other's lips before immediately leaning in to each other and kissing each other. It wasn't hard, and his mustache tickled me. Immediately, a sharp jolt of electricity shot through my body from my chest to my toes. I hear something sliding onto the ground. It's his self-portrait. His large arms are wrapping around me, embracing me possessively and pulling me into his hard chest. Together our lips parted, and we both took advantage of this, letting our tongues meet. I feel our bodies slowly tilting in my direction. My back is meeting the cushion and he's going with the flow. Why not? Why not enjoy the flesh of someone and have fun? Like my aunt said, he wasn't fighting my brother. He's just a man and I am just a woman. Tonight, he was all mine, to do with as I pleased.[Chapter 7] 7 Normal pov Ivan was furious that his son decided to go out with some girl instead of come home to rest. He still had training the next morning, and Ivan would not let some woman take his mind off the goal at hand. He exited the shower of his small bathroom of his small room in his small apartment. He dried his messy silver locks on his towel and slid on some long pants and a t-shirt. He sat down in his bed thinking about America, where everything was flashy and its people boasting constantly 'We're number 1'. He remembered he silenced them all 30 years ago. He reached into his dresser and pulled out the thick stack of envelopes from her . He got comfortable against the wall at the head of his bed. Dear Ivan, I'm sorry I couldn't be there to wipe the blood from your face after your match. I am sorry I could not be the positive face you saw in the sea of your people. I would have wanted nothing more than to wipe the sweat from your brow and tell you how proud I was of you. Apollo's wife, Mary Anne, was in a horrible car accident. She did not make it. This is why I left Russia on Christmas. I hope you are well and I hope to hear from you very soon… Dear Ivan, I know this is the sixth letter, and I know you probably do not wish to talk to me or hear from me, but I felt in my soul you should know I am pregnant and the child is yours. I know you are living your life and enjoying it. But I wouldn't rob you of the knowledge of knowing you have a son. I plan to name him Alexander Sascha Creed. In this envelope is the ultra sound. Already he is so beautiful… Dear Ivan, Alexander grows strong everyday that he is in my belly. He is a fighter I can feel it. At six months, he is already wanting to meet the world. I cannot wait to see how big he is in my hands… Rocky has forgiven you for what you did to Apollo, but he will not forgive you for silently ending things with me and leaving me here with a baby to raise on my own. But I am not upset, and I have forgiven you. We both knew this dream was going to end. I don't want you to get in trouble with the press in your country. I will not see our son as a bastard. He's just born of two different worlds… Dear Ivan, Here he is. Alexander, perfectly healthy, perfectly strong. He looks just like you… Ivan dropped his arms of the letters covering his face as he bawled. There were numerous pictures from ultrasounds to pictures of mother and son growing up together. There's a picture of Alicia standing behind Alexander as he was on a small tricycle. He had straight hair and beautiful skin and he was smiling at the camera. There were hundreds of pictures and he missed them all. And this was all Rocky's fault. Had Ivan not lost his fight to him, he would not have become such a pariah. He would not have been so cut off from the world. His sadness melted into anger and he knew, he would have his revenge. He would be back on top of the world. Astrid's POV I was panting wildly as I gripped the sheets hard on my bed. I just stared down at Viktor as his face had disappeared between my legs. His tongue was hot and flicked my clit just right. My head fell back as a sharp and hot spark exploded in my opening and I cried out as I came. I knew both his mouth and cock would please me. To feel such thickness in my mouth surprised me. He was going to rip me in half and the thought excited me. I felt his pointer and middle finger rub fast against my clit as he leaned up and kissed me hard, both of us tasting each other on our lips. He kept rubbing my sensitive folds and I whimpered, my body arching against his. I wrapped arms feeling my body melting against his touch. He pulled back slowly, a thin line of saliva forming between our lips. The window in the upper right of me, showed the moon. Its light illuminated him. His eyes seemed so sparkle and numerous black spots flowed down his body from the snow. He seemed perplexed and mysterious. I felt his hips lowering between my body and I spread my legs mechanically for him. His hand came up to my face and with his thumb, he rubbed the side of my brow toward my temple. His eyes asked me if I want this and my glazed eyes say yes. I feel his body pushing into me and I inhale gently feeling the head of him open me up. I can imagine a dark place being spread by a thick rod of pure light. He pushed all the way in and we both groaned. immediately he started to pump into me, his lips parting to release soft gasps. My head fell back and I let out a long moan as I feel him deep in my stomach. He doesn't take his time. He doesn't want to go slow. He started to move faster already, his face digging into my shoulder, and his hand clutching the top of my hair. I cry out feeling my legs wrap around his bottom. My arms move around his shoulders trying to connect, but his broadness stopped that. I'm panting hard feeling my soft walls tingling and vibrating like crazy. My nails dig into his flesh and I feel his hot breath in my skin as he pants. My hips begin to rock back against his, letting him know how much I was enjoying this. Viktor looks back down at me and kisses me sloppily. His eyes shut tight as he thrusts harder and faster. I'm already at my limit and I groan hard, my eyes shutting hard as I feel my body shaking hard against his hold. He grunts hard and lets out a growl like moan as he reaches his limit inside me. We stare at each other's panting face and he gives a tired smile as he rolls off me and lies beside me. Already I miss him inside me. That's a new feeling. We are quiet as I lied on my side gently running my middle finger gently over his chest. I feel his knuckles lightly moving in circular motions on my hip. I don't know what to say and I guessed neither did he. We lied like this for a bit and I wondered what time it was. I glanced over his body toward my dresser to see it was only midnight. I wasn't even tired really. Should I say something? Should he say something? I slowly look up at him and he's looking up at the ceiling. I lean forward and kiss the side of his chin. This brings his attention to me and he stares at me with his deep lustrous eyes. He leans down to me and I lean up to kiss him. Already I want him again and he feels the same as his arms are locking around me once more. I move closer to him, the kiss deepening. The heat rises again in my body and now I want to take charge. I sit up and swing my legs over his and he just stares up at me with fire in his eyes. He bites his lower lip again and immediately it turns me on. My hair is messy, my corkscrews curls released by his fingers earlier from our journey from the couch to my bed. His hands lock on my hips, but he doesn't hold me tightly. It's like he's giving me a choice to slip away from his hold should I want to change my mind. Even in heated passion, he's a gentleman. His cock is already hard again and my thighs are moist from my juices. I hold onto his hands as I lean my body and reach between our warm bodies. His eyes never left mine. They are just as locked as when we walked inside the complex. He looked nowhere except at me. He makes me wonder how does a moment like this last forever, because I wanted it to. I take him in my hands and position him at my begging entrance. I sit down on him slowly and we both smile as we exhale softly. I had the perfect view of him and even now he is still a giant. He could hurt me if he wanted to, he could kill me if he wanted to. I never forgot to think realistically about someone sometimes, especially a man. But once I take all of him in, everything goes hazy and I see stars in my eyes. I close them and my grip on his hands tighten as I begin to move up and down, riding him like a horse who needed to be broken in. As I move, I watch as pleasure floods his eyes, his hands moving up to massage my breasts and grope them lightly. He pants lowly as I grind my hips into him now, tightening my vaginal muscles every few seconds to watch a ragged grunt escape him. He felt amazing, better than anyone I had ever had. I could hear love songs in my mind making this even better for me. My hair is making me hot, so much thick 3c/4a hair. Suddenly, Viktor sits up. It's a fast movement I nearly fall back, but he grabs my hands, curling his fingers in his and holding them above both our heads. His lips capture mine and we move our hips in perfect sync with each other. His rock wall of a chest pushed into mine. I loved how calloused his hands were. Our foreheads just stayed pressed against each other as we stared at each other. Why was this different? I wanted to try and think of my other lovers to figure it out, but my attention could not be taken from him even if I tried to. \" Oh fuck.\" I moaned breathlessly. \" I'm cumming.\" he breathed and I nodded mouthing 'me too'. I cried out while he let out a growl. Our bodies shake and we fall back on the bed together remaining quiet. I lied on his chest looking at our hands still curled and out stretched on my king-sized bed. I wondered if he was asleep, maybe I should roll off him so he didn't have my weight on him. I made the attempt to move, but his other arm around my lower back stopped me. \"Don't…\" he said suddenly and I looked at him with soft eyes, the lust gone. He looked down at me. \"I like your body heat on me.\" I nodded slowly with a tired look and just looked back at our hands. His large palm devours my small fingers. I don't think men ever cuddled or lied here this much. Well except for Ricky, but he doesn't count. \"This was… my first time.\" he says lowly and almost as nervously as if he didn't really want me to hear him. I gave a gentle sigh in reply. My first instinct was to call bullshit, but now I wasn't so sure. When we undressed each other, he took his time with me. He drank in the sight of me with each article of my clothes leaving me. His touches were careful as if he didn't want to bruise my skin, as if he didn't want to lose control. His eyes yelled inexperience. \"I'm glad I could be your first.\" I replied. I hoped this wasn't his intent, to lose his virginity then go on with his life. I'd be upset about it, because I already enjoyed his company, but I would accept it eventually and move on. At least I told myself that. He replied with holding me close and kissing the top of my head. A harsh vibrating noise rips through the tranquility of the night. I knew it was not my phone. I moved off him again and this time he let me. He rolled on his side and reached onto the floor where his clothes were in a pile. I just stared at his rippling back as I listened to him answer the phone. He sounded calm when he answered, but soon his tone dipped into annoyance. He was arguing with someone, but then hung up the phone and just let his head fall. I knew this was the end. It was over. Viktor rolled over to me and he looked upset. \"I am sorry. I must get going.\" he said and I nodded, my eyes light showing I wasn't upset. \"Okay. Let me drive you home.\" I replied and he shook his head. \"No. I can walk.\" he said and I gave him a crazy look. \"Are you crazy? You can't go out there alone. You could get mugged or something.\" I stated as he sat up. He shrugged. \"I have no money.\" he said and I scoffed. \"People could still try and hurt you.\" I replied and he shook his head and raised his hands curling them into fists and posing in a fighting stance as if he were in the ring. \"I have my guns right here.\" he said with a smirk. I watched him get dressed and moved over to my closet and pulled out one of my long robes. Once he was dressed, I guided him to the door. His hand was in mine the entire walk to the door. Once he stood in front of the door he turned and looked down at me. \"Thank you for a… magical night. Can I see you again?\" he asked. For sex? I wanted to ask but I decided I wouldn't ask. No matter what we did, I knew I would enjoy it as long as he was with me. \"Yes. Trade numbers?\" I asked, and he nodded and we gave the other our phone. After a few seconds of silently doing that, we exchanged phones and looked up at each other with intense gazes. He gently reached out and gripped my neck softly and leaned down kissing me passionately. \"Good bye.\" he replied against my lips and I gave a tired smile. \"No good byes… until next time.\" I corrected softly looking up at him and he nodded. \"Until next time.\" he replied and I watched as he exited the apartment. I slowly closed the door, locked it, and placed my back against the door.[Chapter 8] 8 The next morning, I showered and straightened my hair this time. I went out to take some photos of the land. The snow was beautiful as it fell. A part of me wanted to hear from Viktor, but the other part wanted me to leave him alone and just not worry. Last night didn't mean we were an item. He's a professional fighter. He had tons of training to do. As I was returning from the park, I noticed a familiar car parked in my spot. Standing beside the driver's side was my brother. I was not expecting him to be here. I parked, cut my engine off, and got out. He approached me with a light smile. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, and he shrugged. \"I figured this was the only way to get you to talk to me.\" he said. I looked him over and shrugged. \"What do you want?\" I asked and he sighed and shook his head moving closer. \"I don't want to fight anymore. I shouldn't have yelled at you and said those things I said.\" he said. I wasn't sure if I should accept his apology. But who was I kidding? \"Look, Azzy, you're my sister, my twin. It's just been us from birth. We came out of our mom holding hands.\" I looked down smiling at the thought. Our mom told us that story. I wasn't sure if it was the truth, but Adonis believed it. \"I don't want to fight anymore either.\" I replied and he smiled and raised his hands and we embraced each other. He smelled of sweat. He must have been training. \"In a few months I'm going to be fighting this guy soon. Rock… he said he won't train me. Too much bad blood.\" he explained. I nodded and leaned back. I could hear how hurt he was. I hadn't spoken to Rocky in a while and I refused to look at any social media that involved my brother and this guy he was going to fight. I didn't even ask my brother the opponents name. \"I need you in my corner.\" \"You always have me in your corner. And I'm sure Rocky has his reasons… but let's talk about you. You're going to be a father.\" I replied and he smiled wide. \"Yeah. A daddy!\" he said with excitement. It felt odd seeing him here. I would never spend money just to see someone for a few minutes in another country then just leave. \"Would you like to come in?\" I asked and he shook his head eyeing my place. \"Nah. I can't. I'm actually here for a family get together. There's an art show taking place here tonight. Auntie and Alexander are going to be there.\" he said. My eyes popped in shock. \"What! Everyone's going to be here and no one told me?\" I asked. Adonis laughed. \"Auntie wanted me to tell you since I was flying here already.\" he said, and I gawked. \"Well who's art is going on display, what time does it start, what time is everyone getting there, what am I going to wear!\" I snapped, and he raised his hands. \"Slow your roll. It's a grand event featuring Simone Avant. A few celebrities and singers will be there. Of course, the Creed Family got VIP passes. It starts at seven. And Celine Dion gave this to auntie to give to you for that portrait of her husband.\" My aunt was a fan of Celine's music and Celine was a major fan of my aunt's art and soon my own. When her husband, René Angélil died, I painted a grand portrait of the two. It took me five months to paint. It would be perfect. Adonis reached into the back seat and that's when I noticed the hanger of plastic hanging up. He slid it out and raised it up to me. I immediately saw white with warm cotton around the hem. \"What is that?\" I asked in utter shock and he smiled. \"This is the dress Celine wore when singing Ashes for the Deadpool 2 movie. She had one custom designed for you and the cold. She wanted you to have it.\" he said. Tears streamed down my face as I covered my mouth. I loved her dress from the music video. To be able to wear it gave me great pride. \"OH MY GOD!\" I squealed and leaned forward hugging my brother. \"And you have shoes in the back seat too.\" he said. I pulled back and looked inside the back to see beautiful white heals with jewels around the front. They were open in a white shoe box. A white envelop was on the top of it. I picked it up and opened it. Astrid, Let this outfit be a token of my appreciation for everything the Creed Family has done for my family. Your aunt said you said I looked like a goddess. Well now you can too. -Celine I closed my eyes and pressed the letter to my chest. Oh how I loved Celine Dion. Her music was as flawless as she was. Adonis just smiled. \"Let's get all this inside.\" he said and I nodded and led him inside. We put the outfit away and he informed me of the limo that would be picking the entire family up. Simone Avant was a model and an artist. Her style of expressionism was out of this world amazing. I had never met her and hoped to do so tomorrow night. \"I'm going to head back to my hotel. I'll see you tomorrow night.\" Adonis replied as he hugged me. I nodded and saw him out. The next day was like a dream and I didn't want to wake up. I showered, lotioned up and got ready. Aunt Alicia called me and told me they were on their way maybe twenty minutes ago. I put on the dress and felt I would cry again at its beauty. My hair was in soft waves and my shoes fit perfectly. The entire outfit fit perfectly. I picked up my phone and decided to text Viktor earlier. He said he wanted to hang out, but he was going to some outing with his father and some business friends of his. There was a knock on the door and my head snapped up taking me away from the phone. It must have been Adonis. I moved over to the door and opened it. My eyes popped at who was standing there in a nicely pressed uniform. \"Alexander!\" I said happily. Alexander stood tall at six-three with sandy brown hair and popping blue eyes. He had a strong jaw line and an intimidating stare when he wanted to intimidate someone. He was tall, handsome, and wanted by many women. His outfit was a beautiful navy green with black pointed shoes. Under his arm was his hat. \"Astrid!\" he said happily and we embraced each other. His scent rolled over me and I could smell his cologne. It was a scent auntie picked out for his eighteenth birthday. I bet it made her happy to smell it on him. Her baby boy. \"Oh my god, you look amazing!\" I said pulling back and he smiled down at me. \"Me? Look at you, Celine!\" he complimented, and I smiled happily. I gathered the white shawl that came with the dress and put it on. I walked with my arm around Alexander's. We looked like some royal couple. Many stared at us as we moved through the building and finally outside. Aunt Alicia was waiting outside in a beautiful black dress with stripes on the hem of her dress and sleeves. Around her neck was a beautiful diamond necklace with matching earrings. Her hair was down and straight. It was professional almost for a woman her age. Red heals popped at her feet. Adonis was standing beside her smiling in his nice black suit. Aunt Alicia saw me and smiled. \"Oh you look amazing, Astrid.\" she said hugging me gently. She pulled back to look my face over which I was happy for. She could tell me if my makeup was off or if I had lipstick on my teeth. She didn't comment so I knew I was good. \"Aight ya'll let's go slay. The power family is going to be the best family there!\" Adonis called out jokingly as he opened the back door for us. We were a very goofy family when we were all together. We rode in the back laughing and talking about the past and the future. It was a joyous scene. Aunt Alicia sipped champagne from her slim wine glass and laughed beautiful. She was truly a gorgeous woman and the definition of strength. She was my inspiration for The Giver. We arrived at The Bohdan and Varvara Khanenko Museum of Arts. There were numerous cars parking and mild traffi, but our limo drove off to the side of the building across the street where there were other limos and expensive looking cars parking. Our driver found a spot and opened the door for us. We exited the car and the air was crisp. There were a few snowflakes falling. Numerous people were walking across the street wearing beautiful gowns and suits. Some men wore bow ties and tuxedos. Women wore pears and ribbons while young girls wore diamonds and anything sparkly. \"Let's go slay.\" Alexander said raising his arm to Aunt Alicia who just gave him a humorous glance before wrapping her arm around his and guiding us across the street. Adonis did the same, raising his arm to me, and I took it following after out aunt and cousin. There were flashing lights everywhere and reporters near the front. \"And here comes world known artist, Alicia Creed, sister of the famous boxer Apollo Creed. With her is son and Sergeant Alexander Creed. Walking behind us is twins, Adonis and Astrid Creed, the children of boxer Apollo Creed.\" I heard someone announce. At least he didn't say the illegitimate children. We followed everyone on the red carpet up the heavy marble steps of the museum. The cold air flushed from our bodies and in unison, Aunt Alicia and I peeled out of our shawls and coat almost modeling as pictures were taken. Two staff members took our coats sand disappeared with them. Art museums were equivalent to the play pen at McDonalds for me. Immediately, the four of us melted into the scene along with everyone else. Staff members served drinks and I could hear someone singing. It was not a recording but an actual person singing. I knew the voice. Leona Lewis is here? I moved gracefully through the crowd looking for her, following her voice. People complimented my dress, taking note of it immediately. It got me more attention than I thought. As I moved I noticed a familiar painting and I paused now and stared up at it. It was a picture of him, my father standing tall in the ring with his gloves raised high. He was surrounded by all the men he had boxed. Their arms are raised at him in praise. I didn't draw this. My Auntie did. His face was perfectly shaped, his skin dark and smooth looking. He looked like the king of the world. \"A great man.\" A low, thick accented voice said above me. I merely jumped at the giant before me. I was stunned to see who it was. Viktor's father. What was he doing here? I mean he had every right to be here. Was this the meeting Viktor spoke of? The man looked cleaned up with his face shaven. The last time I saw him, he did not look so well kept. He was in a black suit and tie. I cleared my throat and nodded. \"I heard he was. It's a shame I never got to meet him.\" I said. He looked down at me and nodded. \"I met him once.\" he said and I looked up at him mildly taken back. \"What was he like?\" I asked. His bottom lip stuck out a bit as he looked back at the painting. He seemed to be reminiscing of the past. \"Cocky, but proud of his country.\" he said. \"I fought him once in an exhibition match…\" The vibe he was giving off was quite dangerous. Had I seen him somewhere? On TV perhaps? \"Who won?\" I asked lowly, and he just looked down at me with blank eyes. Our eyes just stayed connected and slowly the emotions filled me quickly. My auntie told me my father was killed in an expedition match with a Russian soldier. The air around me darkened and it seemed we were the only two standing here on the face of the earth. My heart beat increased and I felt almost sick. \"Champagne?\" a short, black haired girl asked bringing me back to the world around us. \"Astrid.\" Adonis called out. I blinked rapidly as my twin was at my side, hand on my lower back. He glared at the stranger before me. \"You good?\" He was asking me and right now I wasn't sure. \"Ah Ivan Drago.\" I hear my aunt say as now Alexander and my aunt approached standing beside my brother and I. We both moved aside so my aunt could see the man. \"Drago?\" I whispered. I never knew the names of the man who killed my father. I noticed the older man look at my aunt with a sort of softness before looking at my cousin who just stood straight like a soldier, eyes warry of the man who was making his little cousin uncomfortable. Aunt Alicia stared at him politely dipping her head at him. \"I didn't know you liked art.\" she said and Ivan Drago nodded taking the champagne from the young girl and downing it immediately. \"Alicia… I am here with family and comrades.\" he said. He said my aunt's name with a touch of softness. Was I the only one who noticed that. I looked back at my aunt to see she was staring at him politely. Something was very wrong here and I was hoping I didn't figure it out. At that very moment he was joined by two people. One a very talk and pale skinned woman approached us wearing a black dress, the shoulders big and puffy. Her dress flowed at the bottom which took attention away from her long prudish face. Ivan scowled in her direction and looked away as if not too happy to see her. \"Ah Alicia Creed. Time has done you well.\" she said. \"Ludmilla Drago. Time has been fair to you.\" My aunt countered. The woman almost scowled but looked up at Ivan Drago. \"So the Creed clan and the Drago family meet again after all these years.\" she said and I was confused by her words, but immediately my eyes popped as Viktor came up behind his father looking almost withdrawn in the eyes. Adonis glared heavily and Viktor gave the same glare, not even looking my way. Ludmilla smirked at Alexander. \"And who is this… strapping young soldier?\" she asked with venom in her words. My aunt smiled up at my cousin who never looked away from Ivan Drago's face. \"This is my son, Alexander. You already know nephew, Adonis Creed. And my niece, Astrid. Children these are Ludmilla Drago, her… husband Ivan Drago.\" she introduced. But her eyes questioned him when she said husband. I caught that too. \"And their son, Viktor.\" \"Yeah I know who you are. You killed our father.\" Adonis said aggressively. My body was ultimately still as the invisible camera of my life zooms into my face as it captures every inch of my surprised face. \"Adonis, mind your manners. We are all friends here.\" Aunt Alicia scolded, looking at the three. Ludmilla looked very proud as Adonis said that and Ivan just looked down. \"That is the past.\" he said looking up at us again. \"Right now, we focus on future, the fight between my son and him .\" He motioned at my brother. \"He has a name.\" Alexander defended with a hard tone and stare. Viktor notices it and takes a step closer to his father as if ready to defend him. Adonis does the same as if ready to throw a punch if a fight breaks out, his eyes glaring up at the men. Ludmilla laughs wrapping her black gloved hands around Ivan Drago's arm. \"How cute. Your boys show the same gushing energy as their father and uncle did so many years ago.\" she chided. Aunt Alicia just stared at her with a calm smile before gently tugging at her son's arm. \"Come. We have more art to look at.\" she said before looking at the three Russians. \"Enjoy your night.\" Alexander turned slowly glaring at Ivan Drago before smiling down at his mother and completely tossing him from his mind. Adonis did the same and I just took his arm and let him lead me away. My entire mind was crashing, and I would not dare look back. I thought this was a beautiful dream, but instead it was a nightmare devouring me completely. I wanted to wake up. Someone please wakes me up.[Chapter 9] 9 My world was spinning. Where was I? Who were all these people? I didn't know. I needed a drink. Not alcohol, but water. I was at long rectangular table that had different drinks and bowls of fruit. It took up an entire wall. Down the hall closest to me, I could see Aunt Alicia and Alexander talking. He looked stressed and was doing his best to hold himself back. He wanted to yell, and Aunt Alicia raised her pointer finger at him. Maybe she was telling him to keep it together. He knows. I KNOW he knows. Ivan Drago is his father. I couldn't find Adonis anywhere. I told myself he went off to call Bianca and see how she was doing. This was punishment for never asking his last name. But it was my fault. I fought tooth and nail to make sure I knew nothing of the boxing world that was my brother's playground. He had the rings and I had the canvases and the museums. We had our own world and here he comes moving through both our worlds. I just happen to fuck him first before my brother fights him. I turned from the table after downing the water. It was cold going down my throat and I loved that. I caught Viktor across the square lobby surrounded by beautiful women. He looked so uncomfortable, so out of touch. He saw me and I immediately turned and just walked down another hall that was cleared out of people. I needed silence, I needed to think. God, so this was what total loss felt like. I could only imagine how Alexander was feeling. His father, killed his uncle. Now his cousin who he sees like a brother is going to fight… his brother. What was Aunt Alicia thinking? I heard heels on vinyl floors and glanced over my shoulder to see it was my aunt. I just turned away, my back to her. \"What were you thinking?\" I asked lowly, flatly. \"I was thinking that I was in love.\" she answered. There was no guilt in her tone which upset me more. I turned and faced her with anger, but she looked at me with firms eyes herself like she wanted me to say something smart to her. And I didn't have the strength to do it. \"Titles…You said you both were from different worlds… this is what you meant.\" I concluded. She just stared at me with tired eyes and nodded. \"He was a soldier who came here and fight your father.\" she answered and slowly I nodded. \"And he did something terrible.\" I said very softly taking us back to when we were together in her car. She nodded once more. I shook my head. \"How could you do that to him, to our father?\" I asked, eyes swelling with tears. \"I was young!\" she snapped but inhaled, composing herself. \"Your father called me from Colorado and told me to fly in for a friendly fight. I didn't know who he was fighting. I had a one-night stand that turned into something else completely. I was in love-\" \"Was? You still are. I see the way you look at him and how he looks at you\" I said and she nodded slowly, a tear streaming down her face. \"Yes.\" she said lightly and I shook my head turning away as she approached me. \"I won't lie to you and say being with him was a mistake, because I have no regrets for giving birth to my son, your cousin.\" she said strongly, and I just sniffled some keeping it together. What was I to say? \"Is that why you adopted us? To somehow ease any guilt you may have?\" I asked looking back at her offended face. \"No! I found you because Mary Anne, your father's wife told me you exited. I wanted to come find you immediately and I did. But when I saw you both with your mother, you were happy and healthy. I didn't plan anything until I got news your mother had passed. I had no reason to come into your lives just because. You had lives of your own. But I wouldn't let you bounce around from place to place.\" she said. I stared at her, the hurt still in my eyes, but then I thought, what did I have to be hurt about other than the fact she slept with the man who killed our father? I didn't know Apollo Creed and I didn't know Ivan Drago. All I knew was the love I always had. \"Does Adonis know?\" I asked and she sighed. \"No. But Alexander does and so I am sure I will have him to deal with as well.\" she explained and I just kept sniffling some. I sighed heavily running my fingers through my hair. This drama was good for taking my mind off of what happened between Viktor and I. But then again was I not the spitting image of my aunt? She slept with a man she most likely connected with in the worst way possible. She didn't know Ivan would kill her brother. It was the after that turned everything upside down. And now both fighters' sons are going in the ring together and that scared me more than anything. Just looking at the two when we were all together showed the difference in height and muscle. It really all came down to who wanted to win more. My brother was already a champion, and Viktor wants to dethrone that champion. \"This night was supposed to beautiful.\" I replied walking around her. She immediately took my hand. \"And it still can be. Astrid, my past is mine to bear. Not yours.\" she said. \"We do crazy things when we're in love, we…\" Her eyes moved off to the side as if she was about to go on rant about love, but she let out a quick huff. She blinked rapidly and started to huff more. I looked her over. \"Auntie?\" I said reaching for her as she covered her heart with one hand and raised her other hand to me waving me off. \"Fine… I'm fine dear.\" she said faintly. I took her hand anyways. She was panting now and immediately I was concerned. \"Do you need some water?\" I asked quickly trying to move her back to the end of the hall where other people were. She took a one step. Two step. And I immediately felt her weight in my arms as she fell onto me. I screamed out as we fell to the ground together. \"Aunt Alicia! Aunt Alicia!\" I cried out as her eyes fluttered closed. I shook her shoulders quickly and got no response. She's dead! She dead! I screamed hard in distress causing massive shock to the crowd before us. \"ADONIS! ALEXANDER!\" I was crying heavily now in a state of utter panic and devastation as people muttered around her. Is she alright? Can someone get in here! \"GIVE HER SOME ROOM!\" I shouted violently at everyone. But they're nosy and want to be in the middle of the drama. Immediately, I see a flash of black fabric and white skin. It's him. Ivan Drago cuts through like hot iron in the crowd and leans down to her. He's placing his hands under her body and I'm hitting his shoulder hard. \"Get away from us! Don't touch her!\" I screamed as he lifts her up in the air. Her hair cascades below her as she's lifted, arms sprawled out. Even when unconscious she is beautiful. I squabble to my feet trying to go after them, before I am caught by my brother. He had no right to touch her. She was my aunt, my family. The world around me goes mute as I am screaming in sheer terror. \"Somebody call an ambulance!\" My reflection never looked so dull in a dirty hospital mirror. Everything that happened earlier was so miniscule now. Already forgotten. Nobody cared. Alexander is talking to a doctor and my brother is down the hall on the phone with Rocky then Bianca. I see Alexander's reflection beside me and I turn to him and immediately break down again in his arms. He embraces me hard trying to quiet me. \"Ssshh it's okay. She just had a bad panic attack.\" he says in my ear. But to me that's the same as a heart attack or something worse. \"She just needs rest. Lots of rest. The doctors say she will be just fine.\" I hugged him tight, my eyes burning from tears and mascara. I peek them open to see a watery form of Viktor standing at the end of the hallway. I say nothing as I continue to cry on my cousin's shoulder. The ride from the hospital to my place was a blur. Peeling my clothes away and showering was a blur. I stayed with her for as long as I could until I was told visiting hours were over. I didn't want to leave her but security was there to walk me out. I guess they did not want me to make a scene. I was in a snow pink blouse and bottom. Adonis had to fly back to the US to finish his training and Alexander had to return to his post. He was only allowed leave for the gallery. My phone vibrated softly and I looked at it to see it was Viktor who was messaging. I opened it. Please come out? I closed my eyes for a moment and then grabbed my jacket and slid on my socks and house shoes. I opened the back doors and was greeted by the chilly air. I looked down to see him standing there in a black hoodie and black jogging pants and tennis shoes. Had he been running? \"You shouldn't be here.\" I said coldly. He nodded. \"I couldn't stay away.\" he said with a shrug. \"Will you come down?\" I looked up thinking of what I should do before slowly turning and going back inside. I closed the door and moved towards my front door and left out it. Maybe he would be gone by the time I got out there, but he didn't. He was standing in the middle of the snow-covered road and I just walked up to him. Our breath could be seen it the air. \"You're a Creed.\" he said as if just delivering bad news to me. \"And you're a Drago.\" I replied. Did he know about Alexander? Should I even bring it up? No. It wasn't my responsibility to bring up history that had nothing to do with me. That was between he and his father. He shook his head and looked all around me. \"How is… aunt? Is she okay?\" he asked sounding genuinely concerned. I bounced on my toes a bit trying to stay warm. \"A panic attack. The doctors say she will be alright.\" I replied. He nodded, his eyes showing relief. \"I know why she upset.\" he said. I looked at him intently wondering what he would say. \"She see the man who kill her brother. She's sad.\" I wouldn't say sad. But I just nodded. Why not let that be it. \"I won't kill your brother.\" he said suddenly and I looked back at him, my eyes hardening a bit at his words. \"Good to know.\" I said and he let his had fall some and he shook his head. \"I don't care who you are. Your name… is just name.\" he said, and I immediately shook my head. \"No. Not in our worlds. Names are everything.\" I said. He shook his head taking a step closer to me. \"Not in my world. To everyone I am nothing. To my mother… I am nothing. It made me sick having to stand in that suit and smile for my father's associates. He feels he needs my mom back to bring back titles of his youth.\" he said. \"Seeing you tonight was the best thing that happened to me all day. No amount of training could beat that.\" \"You don't know me.\" I said swiftly trying to smoke screen anything he was trying to do. \"You don't know me. But that night we were together, we weren't Drago and Creed. We are Viktor and Astrid.\" he said. If I denied him tonight, I wouldn't see him again until the day he is supposed to fight my brother. There would be nothing but worry and anxiety that day. I wouldn't feel his touch or see his attention on me. And even now after knowing what I know, I still want his attention and he still has mine. I walk up him and he just looks down at me as I draw closer. I gently stand on my tip toes before him so I am closer. \"Prove to me we are not just names.\" I said softly against his lips before he leans down and captures my own.[Chapter 10] 10 Common knowledge says I should feel guilty for what I was doing, for what I was letting him do to me. But reality set in the second his cock stretched me out on all fours. I may be my aunt, but like she said, her past was hers to bare not mine. The room felt on fire as Viktor rammed into me one powerful thrust after another. Every moan, every grunt that escaped him, I created. To have an effect on someone, to have them make such noises made me feel important. And each moan that left my lips, made his fingers grip my hips tighter. Each position he put me in made me feel better than the previous one. I felt I was in space, my mind connected with his. Finally he had me on my back, holding my right leg over his shoulder and with each long and slow thrust, his eyes locked with mine. My hand gripped the blankets beneath us. I cried out as I felt him deep inside me. He gave a lustful smirk at my cries and kept moving at the same pace. I wondered what would happen if someone came in and caught us, but no one would come. We could do this forever, a Drago and a Creed. I felt like he was a dog and I was a cat and we were supposed to be mortal enemies, but instead we are here fucking. A dog and a cat. I could imagine his father… Ivan Drago slipping into the hospital to visit my weak aunt. He would be in a black hat, jacket and pants, trying to hide who he was. He would be staring at her with tired old eyes wondering how things could have happened between them. He lifts his large hand to gently caress her baby soft skin. How could they have fallen so far from one another? Two sons: A son who protects his mother and despises his father. A son who protects his father and despises his mother. And here we are doing it again. Viktor lied down on his side and turned me on my side so that my back was pressed against his hardened chest. My legs part as he slides right back in, the perfect fit. His arm holds my hips to his as he moves back and forth with more elevated speed. I pant hard feeling the pleasure fill me up and overflow through my mind. One of his arms wraps around my chest and holds on to me as I feel him fill me up. My walls gush with pleasure and I shiver hard. He must have expected this since he held me to him. We panted gently, calming ourselves before the room was silent. I didn't want to ask the questions that needed to be asked. \"What does this make us?\" I hear him suddenly ask, and I looked up at him. His eyes are gentle and fair. He doesn't seem worried, but I knew worry could come at any second. \"What do you want it to make us?\" I asked lowly, cautiously. He stared down at me and shook his head. \"I don't want us to just be this, sex.\" he said. \"I know I will have to take my training more seriously as fight with your brother is coming. But I don't want things to end between us. I don't want fight to end us. I don't want us to go back to being just Creed and Drago, Drago and Creed. That's all the media will say anyways as fight draws near. I know it will not be fair to ask you to root for me… but it would feel good to know someone is on my team.\" he said lowly, his eyes looking down now as he pulls the blankets over our bodies, a sign saying he didn't plan to leave tonight. Which would be okay. I nuzzled into him more. I could only imagine how lost and empty I would feel if I didn't have my own aunt in my corner, my brother. Viktor may have his father in his corner, but it wasn't unconditional love a parent should have for their child. Yet he was fighting everyday to please his father, even if it meant fighting others. I nuzzled my face on his chest and I feel his hand rest on my hair sensually. \"I will not say it will be easy to be in my brother's corner and yours… but I will do my very best to give you the support you need.\" I said, and he closed his eyes and sighed happily leaning his head over mine. \"Thank you.\" he said into my hair, and I smiled and kissed the spot right above his nipple. \"Of course.\" I replied softly. \"So does this make us secret boyfriend and girlfriend?\" he asked in a childlike manner, and I laughed gently, but I knew the question had to be addressed. \"If that means we can still go out even if we have to hide it, and you're not afraid to hold my hand in public and kiss me like no one is watching then yes.\" I challenged. I knew that was a lot to ask of him, because soon cameras would be all over him. Viktor seemed to be processing my words before taking my hand and bringing it to his lips. They were warm and supple. I loved the feel of them so much. \"Yes.\" he replied, and I smiled and watched him bite the tips of my fingers. I giggled and pulled them back only for him to try and bite them again. I don't even remember us falling asleep. A few seconds of quiet and we were out like lights. I awoke to white outside and I blinked as I realized I was on my side. A hot body was pressed into mine, and I blinked slowly looking over my shoulder to see Viktor was slid down to the middle of my bed, his arm around my lower hip, his face pressed into my lower back. He didn't snore, he didn't make a sound. His body moved though, and that was enough for me. I gently moved my arm back and lightly ran my hand over his head only for him to gasp and sit up quickly. I was not expecting that reaction as I noticed he had his hand over his chest. That made me alert. Was he having a panic attack too? I sat up immediately. Not him too. \"What is it? What's wrong?\" I questioned with panic before he shook his head slowly. \"I'm… used to my dad punching me in the chest to wake me up before training. I guess it was just instinct.\" he said softly looking down at his chest. I winced at his words feeling sorry for knowing that. I leaned down and slowly moved his hand away from his chest and kissed it softly. \"Sorry. I… thought you were having a panic attack, too.\" I said. \"We both jumpy.\" he noticed, and I nodded running my fingers through my messy hair. \"Do you have to go?\" I asked and he gave a painful nod. \"Yes. I am sure my dad is expecting me back with a lecture on how a relationship isn't something he is ready for me to have right now.\" he said. I felt bad for him not to have a healthy life like someone his age should. I kept my hand curled into his and I nodded. \"Well text me or call me if you need anything.\" I replied, and he leaned in to me resting his forehead against mine. \"Thank you, for coming into my life.\" he said gently, and I just smiled rubbed my head against his slowly before caressing his cheek. Once he left, I cleaned up my place, showered and headed to the hospital immediately. As I pulled in, parked, and went inside, I noticed Aunt Alicia was already in the waiting room, scribbling on the clip board at the front desk. She was in black slacks, a red blouse and a black coat. A yellow gold necklace hung around her neck. Her fingers covered with black leather gloves. \"Auntie.\" I called and she turned to me with a warm smile. She wasn't wearing any make up and I already felt tears streaming down my face as I embraced her. She shushed me gently and rubbed the back of my hair. \"I'm okay.\" she said. I sniffled and leaned back and looked her over. She looked and smelled clean. \"Alexander said the doctor said you needed to rest.\" I replied and she nodded. \"And I will, but I will not take up a bed when someone else could use it. I will rest at home. My doctors have my records of what happened, and someone will be making house calls to come check on me. That I can assure you.\" she said. I nodded happy she was just standing in front of me. \"You're flying back now?\" I asked, and she nodded. \"I am. I haven't heard from your brother so it is time for me to deal with him.\" she said. And risk stressing herself more. \"Auntie just let it go. If he wants to talk to you, he can. I don't want you overdoing anything.\" I said with concern and she just wrapped her arm around mine and walked me to the doors of the hospital. She shook her head. \"He will be training soon and fighting Viktor Drago here. He must not be distracted.\" she said. But if I knew my brother, I knew he was already distracted. It's not something he can ignore. The woman who raised him and supported him also had a lover who killed our father and his cousin is that lover's son. This news wasn't something to just wash over. \"Is Alex okay? Maybe he didn't tell him.\" I hoped and she nodded. \"He will be fine. He doesn't care about knowing who his father is now. He's went his entire life without him and he will continue to strive with or without Ivan Drago.\" she explained. Reporters were waiting on the other side of the glass door to ask her questions no doubt. But she didn't seem worried. \"What should I do? What can I do?\" I asked, and she shook her head. \"Continue taking your pictures. Paint something.\" she said with an old, wise smile. I thought about her words before nodding slowly. I did want to paint something of Viktor and I. \"Okay. I'll be flying to America to see you and Rocky and everyone else soon.\" I said and she nodded. \"Hopefully before the weigh in of Viktor and your brother. Rocky isn't training him and that's thrown all of us off it seems.\" she said before leaning in and hugging me. I hugged her back and we split from there. Reporters followed us both to our cars, but I drove off without giving any comments. They weren't about me or my aunt's health. They were about my brother's fight. The vultures didn't care. I made sure my phone's bluetooth was on and just listened to my Disney playlist. It kept me connected to my childhood, kept me calm and helped me reminisce to a time when things seemed easier and better. I was listening to Far Longer Than Forever. \"Like no love ever known,\" I sang with Odette and Derek. \"And with your love I'll never be alone. Far longer than forever. Much stronger than forever. And with your love, I'll never be alone.\" Odette was always a beautiful name, I thought. Maybe one day if I have a daughter, I would name her Odette, Odette Viola Creed. Once I was home, I texted my brother to see how he was. I got slow and short responses. I knew he needed to be alone to do this. I got out my sketchbook and thought of what I wanted to draw. Viktor and I. Drago and Creed. Romeo and Juliet. I gawked at the thought and just started to doodle. I got a text from Viktor. Viktor Dad was mad for me coming home late. I actually like that I'm rebelling against what he wants. Me Just don't piss him off more or he'll run you ragged when jogging. Your legs will be jelly by the end of it. Viktor Can I come over later? Me Sure. Are you training now? Viktor Getting dressed to start jogging. Will run by your place soon. Me Okay. Stay warm and don't let him break you. I started to sketch some pages. The first was an outline of Viktor looking into a mirror and seeing his father's reflection. The look of disapproval is visible. On another page, was me doing the exact same thing but it was with my father and he looked almost disappointed. Damn they were good pictures but depressing. I flipped the page and started to sketch something else, something beautiful. I had my Apple Music playing on my Alexa in the kitchen. S Club 7's Never Had a Dream Come True was playing softly on it. I was so into my work, I didn't even hear it turn to Leona Lewis' Here I Am. I drew myself in a long flowing dress, sparkling and purple like Ariel from the Little Mermaid when her father gave her his blessing to be a human by turning her with his mighty triton. It flowed into the oblivion of the bottom page, and I was holding onto Viktor who was shirtless with his arms protectively around me. He's eyes are darkened out as he looks down at me. I sketch everyone's faces around us looking down at us with blatant disapproval. Rocky, Adonis, Alexander, my aunt and father on one side. Ivan Drago, Ludmilla Drago and the Russian flag looked down at disgust at Viktor. How dare he have emotions and feelings for someone else. There was a knock on the door and my head snapped up. Did Viktor come to surprise me? No. He was focused on his work out he wouldn't come here. Or maybe he would. I smiled and got up moved to the door and opened it with a happy smile only for it to drop at the sight of Ricky Conlan staring there in his own work out gear that he could play off as casual close. He looked up at me with his usual half smile. What in the world was he doing here? Author's notes Hey all hope you're enjoying this. Once it ends it will be the last fic of Forbidden Temptation and then ill get back to finish my other fics. I know a guest asked me about if i had anything else in mind with the other characters, but there will not be anything else after this.[Chapter 11] 11 What the hell was he doing here? He was in a long sleeved, black tight shirt of some type of gym brand with black pants and tennis shoes. He smiled genuinely at me, but I kept the door where it was, close to me. \"Ricky what are you doing here?\" I asked. \"What do you mean 'what am I doing here?' I came to see you.\" he said. I kept my hand on the door knob and as he moved in closer, to obviously come in, I held my stance. \"Without a heads up?\" I asked and he shrugged, looking hurt. \"You weren't returning my texts or my calls for that matter. I was worried about you.\" he said. I knew I had been ignoring his calls and texts. \"Ricky there's a reason for that.\" I said lowly looking down almost nervously now. He wasn't an idiot, he knew why I wasn't replying to him. \"Oh yeah, and what's that?\" he asked with a deep confused stare. \"I've been seeing someone okay? I didn't think I owed you an explanation, now please leave.\" I said trying to close the door as quickly as I could so I could lock it. But it swung back as easily as it moved forward. I jumped back immediately, completely taken back by the violent motion as Ricky came in. He closed the door, his eyes never leaving me. His eyes were tight, and focused on me like I was one of his opponents now. \"You think you can just use me like that?\" he snapped and I raised my hands backing away. \"Ricky you need to leave.\" I said, my voice trembling now as I tried to keep a safe distance from him. He shook his head and scoffed. \"I left my wife for you.\" he said. I shook my head. \"I did NOT ask you to do that. You did that without talking to me. You do everything without talking to me!\" I snapped. \"So what that means you just run off with the next bloke huh?\" he snapped loudly. His eyes immediately found my sketch book on the couch and I made a move to grab for it, but his long arms darted out and grabbed it before me. My stomach tightened as if he had grabbed a small child with violent intent. \"Give it back!\" I pled, and he just flipped it open. My eyes watered already as I watched his eyes harden on each page he flipped. He shook his head and then scoffed acidly. He held the book up showing me the new sketch I had just did as if he had found my dirty little secret. \"This guy huh? You left me for him?\" he asked. I just stood there huffing and puffing lowly. He shook his head once more eyeing the picture. \"I always wondered why you wouldn't draw me.\" \"Ricky-\" before I could get another word in, I watched as his rippling arms took my book in his hands and shred it right there in front of me. My eyes widened as if he just taken the child and snapped its neck right in front of me. I let out a painful scream, my face shaking, my hands covering my mouth to hold back any other rotten emotions I was feeling. I cried out hard as he dropped the pages onto the ground. The book cover was ruined, white lines dancing up and around it from the tearing of the thin red layer of the page. I could see parts of Viktor's face shredded, his dark eyes looking at me now. I felt darkness boiling up inside me and I just looked up at Ricky to see the look of guilt on his face as he looked at the ripples of pages around him. \"Astrid, I'm so sorry.\" he said and my face was shaking with anger as I shook my head. \"Get the fuck out of my house.\" I said lowly, my shaky and disturbed. \"We need to talk about this.\" he said, but I was in front of him immediately, hitting at his face and scratching and clawing and sometimes punching. He just leaned his shoulders from left to right dodging my meager blows of rage. \"GET OUT!\" I screamed. I was hoping to maneuver him toward the door or go absolutely crazy enough to make him say 'deuces'. But he wouldn't budge. He was trained to take blows. He starts grabbing at my shoulders trying to talk me down, but I can only see rage. I feel my legs leave the ground as I am projected across the air, towards the wall next to my room. I tumble over, my hand clawing at the wall to catch myself, but instead I just tear another painting down. I groan a bit feeling as if that stopped my rampage. I see Ricky still standing there with rage in his eyes. \"You want to hit me eh!\" he said grabbing my Giver painting and my eyes widened as I watch him slam it down on the ground until the frame cracks and the portrait is shredding. I feel my heart break as I let out a blood curdling scream. Normal POV For once Viktor was excited to be jogging for his normal route consisted of running by Astrid's home. Astrid, it made him think of asteroids then his mind would drift off to space somehow. His dad was driving closely behind he was running as fast as he could. He didn't tell him to change routes, so this made him lucky. Even though they couldn't be in public in cameras, just being with her made his heart burst with butterflies. His father would scoff at his feelings should Viktor ever voice them or be caught gazing out the window of their apartment. He was coming upon her home now and was hoping she would be sitting on her balcony waiting for him. He waits for her at home even though he knows she would never come there. But he doesn't know that. He's too embarrassed to even invite her to his home, to the life he was born in. He was just starting to see her balcony and was disappointed she was not there. But as he continued running, he noticed a very shiny, very wealthy car parked next to hers. As he drew closer, he came to a complete halt. His father planned to scare him into running, but slowing his speed a few miles, but Viktor just looked at him with a hard glare and Ivan stopped the car. \" What are you doing?\" he snapped as he stuck his head out the window. Viktor didn't respond all he did was look up toward her window. Something wasn't right. There was no reason another fancy car should be in this neighborhood. Of course there could be hundreds of reasons, but to Viktor there was no reason. He stared up at Astrid's windows hoping somehow, she would feel him, sense he was there come out to him. He needed to see her face, needed her to smile down at him and wave if she wanted. He panted lowly waiting ignoring the blaring horn of his father's truck. Suddenly, a loud scream tore through the blankness of his mind and his body jerked forward without any more thought. He ran inside, his father's protests had gone deaf in his mind. He rips opens the door of the complex and rushes towards the stairway. A scream was all he needed. He ran up the stairs skipping multiples steps as he ran. Astrid's POV Ricky grabbed me and now had me up against the wall as he had ruined more of my paintings that had meaning to me. We sound like a couple having a domestic dispute. Maybe that's why no one was coming to help me. We mind our own business and just hope the problem goes away. We'll find the dead body later. I'm screaming for him to leave and he's yelling at me to just calm down and listen. But I was over that the second he tore up my sketch book. \"Get off of me!\" I'm shouting at the top of my lungs. My throats burning and my shirt is ripped from him grabbing at me so much. There's a loud bang that erupts in the room and we both look over to see a heavenly sight. \"Viktor.\" I whispered. Viktor's torn off his hoodie and running at Ricky who already had violence in his mind. This was not a ring, or a fight for the cameras. This was a brawl. The two men collided with Viktor raising Ricky in the air and slamming him down on my coffee table. It was like an explosion as the furniture gave out immediately under the men. Punches were violently thrown to each other's faces and I just keep my back to the wall, mouth covered and eyes widened. The sound of fist to face made my stomach clench of fear. I hadn't seen such a violent fight since I was back in the detention centers. Viktor looked so primal as his massive fists showered down onto Ricky's face. Ricky brings his knee up and gets him in the side and with his size, Viktor falls over and the two are wrestling and continuing to violently assault each other. \"Stop it!\" I cried out, but no one heard me. They were going to kill each other. I quickly turn and move to my room. The drawer beside my bed had my peace of steal in it, my Smith and Wesson Shield 9mm. I grabbed it, took the safety off and prepared it. My first thought was to shoot into the ceiling, but their people living above me. Why should their lives be affected by my brash, excited choices? I moved into the living room, aimed at my back window and fired. BANG. BANG. Glass shatters immediately. Ricky and Viktor jumped back. That split them a part. They looked at me with hard pants and surprised eyes. Viktor has a cut on his lower lip and eye. Ricky has bruises all over his body as well. I aimed the gun at him immediately. \"You want to fight a bullet? Get out.\" I said venomously, sweat pouring down my face some. Ricky just stared at me with disbelief. I slowly cocked my gun, my brain asking me if I was truly ready to do the next step if I have to. \"I will not ask again.\" Viktor looked at Ricky with hard eyes, ready to fight again should he have to. Slowly Ricky raised his hands, his body moving up and down with his pants. Bits of glass from my coffee table were in his arms and back. \"I'm gone.\" he said. And you had better stay gone. He slowly eased toward the door, having to walk past Viktor to do so. My gun followed him to the door. He kept his hands open and eyes on me as he moved. \"You come here again… and I will kill you.\" Viktor threatened voicing my thoughts. Ricky didn't respond as he simply left the room. I didn't lower my gun yet, not until I moved over to the back door and saw him leave in his car. I panted gently as I heard the familiar sound of a police siren. I hear heavy footsteps and look up at Viktor as he leans in and takes the gun from me. He sets it down on the ground and just leans in to me, gently letting his forehead rest against mine and we just looked down, our eyes closed. He rests his hand on my head and keeps me close as we hear heavy footsteps coming down the hall. To feel his skin against my own brought me great comfort where sadness was about to devour me. My beautiful paintings, destroyed.[Chapter 12] 12 The police came and arrested Viktor and I. At their station, I told them my side of the story. An ex-lover couldn't handle the break up and trashed my home with intent to probably hurt me. Viktor was just a good Samaritan coming in to save a woman who needed helped. Had I not mentioned my last name, along with one witness who said they saw Viktor run in to help and another guy leave, they probably would have found some reason to hold me longer. I didn't see a need to try and talk to Viktor about our stories. He did just happen to come by and decided to help me. I was sitting in the waiting room, waiting for them to return my gun that they had found in the search. Viktor was in another room waiting. I had so much to think about. My painting, my art, my reasons to enjoy life were destroyed by a man child. I couldn't believe this. A tall figure loomed over me and I looked up to see Ivan Drago looking at me with a scowl. My scowl matched his. He looks like he's pouting almost. He's dipped in black and grey clothes. He didn't have to look like a bum all the time. Maybe he would stop feeling sorry for himself and be a father to his son. \"So this is Alicia's niece. Couples disputes… now you dragging my son into this.\" he said in a chilly tone. I scoffed. \"You're one to talk.\" I said venomously. He frowned harder at my words. \"You will stay away from my son. No good will come from you.\" he said, and I looked up at him not surprised at his words. Is that what your wife said about you and my aunt. That no good could come from being with her. Alexander came out of them. An officer came over and returned my gun and phone to me. He was a chunky man with brown thin hair and a red nose. \" Ms. Creed you must be careful with the company you keep.\" he said with a smile. It had to be because I was a Creed. I nodded and took my gun from him concealing in its case. I then looked back at Ivan Drago who was watching me with a glare. \"And with all due respect Mr. Drago… your son is a grown ass man.\" I stated before looking past him and walking around him like he did not exist to me. My aunt would be proud as I used the same tone and just the right amount of sass and attitude. She never liked being told what to do especially by a man and neither did I. I merely walked around him heading to the door. I didn't think it was wise for Viktor to see me with his father, so I couldn't wait for him like I wanted. None of my family needed to know what happened. Adonis would go after Ricky immediately if he found out. And my aunt would be just as worse. There won't be enough lawyers in his court to shield him from me! I remember she stood like a queen in the atrium of the mansion. She was in a beige suit, pearls around her neck and earring. Some kid had vandalized my brother's car in high school. It was one of my father's cars so of course she took even greater offense to that. She definitely sued and won. I had to handle this on my own. I sent Viktor a text. If he wanted to come over tonight when his dad was asleep, I would be here. If not then that's okay too. I was sure he needed to rest after that unexpected fight. I wanted to thank him in person. I spoke with the landlord as soon as the taxi dropped me off. I told him I would pay for the damages of the glass to my balcony window and to any other damages pertaining to my room only. I even promised him and his friend's tickets to the Drago/Creed fight if he so wished. And he definitely wished. A locksmith came that same day and fixed the door. Surprisingly it was still standing after two large men with great legs kicked it open. Twice. I was an empty shell as I cleaned up the glass in the apartment. I didn't stop until everything was cleaned. I had to lift the couch myself since it was knocked over. It took hours to sweep up the glass, mop and throw away the large chunks of mess that was my coffee table. Last were the broken frames and pieces of my art. I couldn't ignore them. The Giver had a large rip in her stomach and she wasn't real anymore. Nothing seemed real anymore. I locked my gun away, looked at the blankness of my place. It was clean I guess, but empty and bland. I couldn't sleep that night. Viktor had not messaged me back and like I had texted him, that was okay. He must have gotten in trouble with his father. How dare you stop training to save some woman who could have been killed. It was around 1 in the morning when I heard a knock. I was curled up in my blankets. \"GO AWAY!\" I shouted. \"Is that any way to speak to your boyfriend who saved your life?\" I hear him ask teasingly. I didn't want to get up still. I hurried and ran to the door, unlocked it, and ran back to my room. \"IT'S OPENED!\" I said. The door opened quietly, and I finally noticed the loud squeaking noise that came from it. My door was opened in my room and so Viktor stood there staring at me. I just looked at him from the side as my head wouldn't leave the pillow. He was in another black hoodie and sweats. \"I'm sorry I got you in trouble with your dad.\" I said softly. He shook his head and finally came in. He kicked his shoes off and crawled over me and wrapped an arm around my stomach pulling me into him. He didn't smell like sweat and adrenaline. Clean and washed. I melted into him. \"You have nothing to be sorry for… but I am curious as to why former heavyweight champion Ricky Conlan was here in the first place.\" he said. I nodded and turned on my side to face him. His eyes were soft and gentle, understanding. I didn't want that to change from any secrets or deceit. \"Before I met you, Ricky and I… got together whenever I was in Liverpool. He had made a habit of showing up here unannounced. He wanted to be more. I didn't.\" I said turning to reach over to my dresser and grab my phone. I opened it to my messages and showed him the numerous texts of him wanting to see me and me not responding. \"After I met you, I stopped messaging him. So when he showed up today and I told him I was seeing you, he got upset.\" Viktor looked my phone over taking it from me gently. His eyes moved up and down as he scrolled, but he just shook his head and gently tossed my phone onto the floor. He took my face in his hands and kissed me passionately and heatedly. \"I don't care about your past relationships. They are the past.\" he said and I smiled against his lips, happy that his feelings didn't shaken for me. I found tears falling down my face and I sat up and wiped them. \"I'm just glad you were there… I can't believe he destroyed my art.\" I replied. Viktor sat up slowly with soft, sad eyes. \"I am sorry he ruined your art.\" he said as his thumbs gently scaled across my cheek wiping my tears. \"But maybe this isn't a bad thing?\" I sniffled some and looked at him now confused. \"Why would you say that?\" I asked lightly, and he shook his head looking away as if trying to find the right words to not upset me. \"Maybe… this is a new adventure for you. For us. I know your art is not something you can replace. But maybe you can create newer works of art. And I help.\" he said. His words sunk into my brain as I thought about it. Maybe he was right. I had had those paintings for years now. \"It can be something we can do together. You can run with me… and I will make art with you.\" So now we can both do something the other likes. I never would have thought of something like that. I mean I could get do a little running and getting back into shape. And together and I could make beautiful works of art together. I started to smile and lean into him gently pecking his lips. \"That sounds perfect.\" I whispered, and he smiled and leaned in to me kissing me lovingly. As much as I wanted him to take me, I was too tired and sore from being tossed to the ground like a doll by Ricky. So we just stayed up and talked for a bit. \"So tomorrow- well today is my rest day. Maybe we can do something later?\" he asked curiously and I looked at him and then at my ceiling before nodding. But my eyes dropped when I realized that it wouldn't be a good idea. \"Your father has demanded that I stay away from you.\" I said and he tilted his head some before nodding and looking at the ceiling. \"I know. But just like him I am determined to be with the woman I want to be with.\" he said. I blinked rapidly and looked at him. \"He's trying to get back with your mom?\" I asked. He gave me a soft look, but it was not a gaze it was just a stare. I stared back at him confused, searching his eyes for the answer before gasping gently. \"You know.\" I replied and he nodded. \"I found the letters she sent to him.\" he said. I nodded slowly sighing gently and looking at the ceiling. \"I wanted to talk to you about it. But I didn't know if it was appropriate to just bring it up.\" I said gently and he nodded. \"It's okay… My dad has never spoken to me about it, but when I saw your cousin, I knew he looked just like my father and your aunt if they had child together.\" he said. I leaned over and touched his face moving him to look at me. He did, but his eyes were numb and cool. \"How do you feel? Are you okay?\" I asked. He closed his eyes and nodded slowly. \"I want to be champion. Nothing will stop me from that.\" he said. \"Besides, I glanced at one of the letters. Your aunt really loved him the way I wanted my mother to love my father.\" he said a single tear streaming down his face. I hurt for him now, and gently I wiped his tear away and kissed the moist spot that the tear had been. \"Just know you always have me.\" I promised and he leaned in to me gently curling his face into my chest. \"Would you like to come to my place? My dad normally hits the bars by noon and is gone for hours.\" he says. I nodded lightly. \"Nothing would make me happier.\" I said gently. He left an hour later promising to text me. Once the sun was up, I pulled my hair back and began to eye my bare walls. New paintings could go here. I didn't expect to be done mourning my others paintings so soon. But the fact I get to challenge myself, made things exciting for me. Once Viktor came back, he and I drove to his place. He only thirty minutes away from my place. I parked and stepped out not seeing the white beat up truck that usually hunted Viktor on the road when he ran. We met around the front and his hands laced into mine. Casually he led me inside the small apartment. Once we stepped in there was a small kitchen to the right, clean but not a woman's touch clean. A doorway led into a small living room with a brown couch across what should have been a tv. But there was not. There was just a wall. I noticed a large blanket over the couch. Not even a pillow was there. I looked at him stunned, my eyes asking if he slept there. He just looked down with embarrassment. That douche bag. \"Show me his room?\" I asked and he shrugged and casually led me to the back of the apartment where a small bed room was. The sheets weren't made and there was a closet with some clothes inside it. I looked to my left to see the bathroom and a dresser on the wall beside the bathroom. I just nodded. \"I'm sorry my place is not big.\" he said and I looked at him and shook his head. \"I don't care about your place. I care about you.\" I replied leaning up to peck his lips of which he replied after smiling. I pulled back before showing a look of viciousness along with a sly smirk. \"Now fuck me on your father's bed.\"[Chapter 13] 13 Viktor's eyes popping like a shocked, shy teenager made my insides turn with excitement even more, and I began to move over towards the head of the bed. \"What? You can't be serious.\" he whispered harshly as if we were sneaking around with his father in the next room. I smirked as I peeled off my coat. He quickly closed the door as if we were hiding now. \"Why not? You said he would be away for a few hours.\" I said innocently as I now kicked off my shoes and slowly removed my ocean blue sweater. I turned to him slowly so he could drink in the sight of me. He inhaled and stared down at me as I held my arms outward. \"You are becoming bad influence.\" he said in a shaky tone and I smirked. \"You want this, we both do. It pains to see how you do not have a life outside your father.\" I said calmly as I approached him. His head dipped down as I stood in front of him now. \"Just think of us as two teens rebelling.\" Because I knew for a fact that he had never gone against his father before except for being with me. He looked almost unsure at me, but I gave a graceful smile. He knew he could say to no me if he wanted and I would understand. I gave a happy smirk and stood on my tip toes at him and slowly his lips spread into a smile as he leaned in and captured my lips. His soft yet dominating lips brought my body to life immediately. It wasn't hard for him to get me aroused and thinking back to his fight with Ricky, brought me to the edge already, or it felt that way. I wrapped my arms around his face and pulled him gently toward the bed, our lips never leaving each other. His arms worked to pull off his jacket. He did it three quick moves. I ran my hands up his chest, feeling his hardened muscles through his shirt. God, he felt amazing against my hands. His hands held my hips and he raised me up and tossed me onto the bed. I let out a soft chuckle as he crawled over me, with a predator like stare. I bit my lip as we began to feel each other over. His hand cupped my breasts and my hand reached down to cup his crotch. He kissed me again, his tongue shooting right down my throat. I let out a deep moan as I feel his crotch rubbing against my hand trying to get as much friction as he could. But his heavy thick pants wouldn't allow it. My hands worked at the buttons of his jeans and finally I managed to get them undone. He grabbed at my pants and attempted to yank them right down with them still fastened but my hips wouldn't allow it. I let a out chuckle where he growled with annoyance. He sat up to kick his pants off, and as he did this, I worked on getting my pants off as well. It took us little time to strip the rest of our clothes off until we were both naked before each other. How perfectly sculpted he was compared to me so imperfect. Where did this warm feeling in the pit of my stomach coming from? It's different, not like anything I had ever felt with past lovers. This is different. He wanted to be boyfriend and girlfriend. I promised that he always had me in his corner even if my blood bounded me to another fighter. We are in a relationship. We are one. I gasped feeling the head of his cock spread me open. My head fell back in utter bliss as my eyes fluttered close. I feel one hand curl into mine as he starts with slow and long strokes. It's almost teasing for me. I hear him grunt softly in my ear and my hips roll back against his. His forehead presses into mine and we stare at each other intently as our bodies push back and forth into one another. Each pant and moan that leaves are lips, it does nothing to break out gaze into each other. 'I love you' his eyes say and I smile gently as if I'm telling him I understand him. I'm reading his mind. I caress his cheek with my free hand, my eyes saying the words back. 'I love you.' It's like I can hear him and he hears me. Truly we are one. It's no longer about rebelling or getting back out family. It's just about us. He kisses me hard and I respond immediately giving a gentle moan. Our movements increase and the familiar jolts of electricity shoot up into my body and I feel so hot, and my insides feel so good. Viktor rolls onto his back and I immediately start riding him like the strapping stallion he is, my Russian stallion. \"I can feel you here.\" he pants his hand resting on my pelvis. \"You're tightening up around me.\" His words alone are causing me to lose focus. God, he feels so good, and with me on top he sinks deeper and deeper inside me. His thumb strokes my clit firmly and I cry out feeling everything started to feel even better. The pleasure is taking me higher and higher. My moans signal this and I cry out hard as I feel my walls vibrating like crazing, the pleasure so intense my head falls back and my hips buck slowly against his. \"Ah god!\" I cry out. But I don't stop moving until he cums. I stare down at his face with half lidded eyes, as I keep moving. My walls are incredibly sensitive but seeing his face scrunch up and his eyes shut tight as he tries to concentrate, were too good to me. I kept grinding my hips until finally he grips my hips hard and lets out a mighty roar of pleasure. I smile gently as he fights to control his heavy pants. Once we have both come down from our pleasurable highs, he pulls me down gently so I can rest on his chest. I'm hardly heavy to him for his chest moves beneath me with ease. As we were silent I thought about the connection we had. Was this the kind of connection my aunt had with Ivan Drago? A connection so strong not even the death of her brother was enough to keep her from him. I believed him when he said he would not kill Adonis. I don't know what I would do if he were die so early in his prime. \"Do you want to read some of her letters?\" Viktor asked slowly, and I looked up at him, his eyes soft and curious as usual. I nodded and rolled off him so he could get out of bed. He walked over to his father's closet and I got a clear look at his back. Rippling muscles and a firm ass stared back at me. I bit my lip trying not to get lost in his form. I looked around the room noticing two pictures sitting on the small wooden dresser next to the bed. I leaned over some to glance at it before noticing who they were. It a young blonde-haired woman smiling a the camera while she held a small baby in her hands. The was He reached in and grabbed what looked like a shoe box off the rack that was bolted for the hangars to go below. His father must have really not wanted him to know about my aunt's letters. I wonder what made Viktor so curious that he had to go looking for answers. He came back over to me and we sat against the headboard together. He placed the shoe box over his thighs and opened it. A small scent of perfume hit my nostrils and I couldn't help but be enchanted by a smell of the past. It was beautiful. My eyes gently flexed at the large stack of white and blue envelopes that were addressed to an old address here. \"Oh my god.\" I said lightly as I reached in and lifted the stack. It was held together by a rubber band and I made sure not to be too aggressive. If it broke, his father would know we were here. There were tons though. \"I only read the first one.\" Viktor said lightly, and I nodded slowly and carefully removing the rubber band from the envelopes. They were all unsealed so I found it easy to remove them. I couldn't believe Aunt Alicia wrote these many letters to Ivan. \"Read them to me?\" I wasn't sure at first. I didn't know if I was ready to read what inside, but it also felt like they validated our relationship together. I nodded and began from the first letter. They were all in order by month. \"Dear Ivan, I'm sorry I couldn't be there to wipe the blood from your face after your match…\" I don't know how long we lied in the bed in different positions to stay comfortable. But I couldn't stop. I wanted to know more about my aunt's past and these letters gave me the answers. It seemed she and Ivan had quite a past and a strong one at that. I could feel the pure and raw emotions in her words as she spoke of still loving him. She even mentioned my father and how she forgave him for taking him away from her. The smell of each letter had a soft and supple smell to it. The scent of her skin was on every piece of paper. I would lie on my stomach at the end of the bed continuing to read while Viktor sat at the head of the bed massaging my feet. God he was good at that. Minutes later, he would join me on his stomach listening with his head on his crossed arms, his eyes watching me as every word left my lips. We rolled on our sides, our backs, I even paced around the front of the bed and kept reading. We eventually got dressed again, and I finished the last letter. \"Dear Ivan, this will be my last letter you. Things were not supposed to lead to this, our separation. I had hoped, as a woman does, that we would have still been together. Alexander would know his father and we would be a family. Where we would have lived, I wouldn't have cared as long as you were with me, as long as Alex was with me. But maybe this is how things should be, our realities. Maybe had we not met in that bar so long ago, we would have never peaked each other's interest. Maybe we were just too different and wanted two different things. I knew what I wanted and I guess now I know what you wanted too. Good bye, my love. Alicia…Creed.\" I finished the last letter and slowly folded it back together and placed it in its envelope. I handed the letter back to Viktor and he began to put the envelopes together. I remained seated at the foot of the bed somewhat saddened by the fact that Ivan Drago never answered a single one of her letters. \"I don't understand,\" I replied looking up at Viktor as he sat beside me, \"Did he not love her Why wouldn't he respond?\" He inhaled gently and shook his head looking forward at the door. \"Maybe he did not get these letters until recently. I grew up with nothing and from the memory of him having everything, he was stripped of everything after fight with Balboa. Maybe they were just sent back to her.\" he said. He sounded just as unsure as I did. I looked down at my feet wondering what this meant for us, if it was even supposed to mean something. I feel Viktor's hand devour my own and I look up at him. He's smiling gently. \"Those letters are about two people whose worlds don't involve us. We are here now, and you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.\" he replied bringing my fingers to his lips to kiss them. \"And I would destroy anyone who tries to keep us apart.\" I smiled at his words and leaned forward and kissed him gently. \"I love you.\" I responded gently and he seemed almost stunned and taken aback by my words. \"I love you.\" he replied and we sat with our heads together for a moment before he led me from his father's room. We walked hand and hand with each other before reaching the door. However, I ended up stopping in front of the door with him behind me. I already knew he was not coming back with me. I stared up at him and he just looked down at me with a prideful smile. \"I will try and come over soon. Then you teach me to paint?\" he replied and I smiled warmly and nodded. \"And you can get me back into shape the next time.\" I replied. He grinned and leaned over me and our lips connected once more. We lingered against each other for a moment before separating. \"Deal.\" he said. I knew my brother would be training himself and I wanted to see him and Bianca. \"I will be leaving for America for a few days to see my family. I know you don't need any distractions while you train, so maybe me not being here won't distract you-\" Don't.\" he said shaking his head. \"I never saw you a distraction even when I first saw you sitting on your balcony. If anything, I thought you were someone I could never have, never deserved because all I knew was this.\" He raised his fists staring at them with hard eyes. \"So no matter where I go, where you go, you'll always be on my mind.\" he said as if promising me. I smiled and kissed his cheek. \"I'll call you tonight. And if I don't hear from you can just text me.\" I replied and he nodded and pecked my lips before slowly moving back from him. Our hands remained locked together until his door way separated us. Sure we would have seemed sappy to some people. But the fact still stood. He was mine and I was his.[Chapter 14] 14 The flight to America was long as usual, but once I was back in my auntie's house it all seemed worth it. My hair was pulled back and I was in a black sweater and sweats staring at Aunt Alicia's face as she sips her tea. She's just told me about her fight with Adonis about her relationship with Ivan Drago. He's definitely not happy with her. I wasn't either at a time, but her anxiety attack reminded me that there more important things in life then the past. \"I'm sure he will come around.\" I said, gently and she sighed some. \"Maybe. I pray this does not get in the way of his training. Lord knows he needs to focus.\" she explained. Her hair was let down and wild, as she was in a night gown and robe. I looked down at the island I leaned over before looking at her. \"Do your regret telling him?\" I asked. I know I would have. She looked up in thought before shaking her head. \"No. Your father had secrets and I have learned it's better to say them then bury them.\" she explained softly. I nodded wishing none of this had happened. She tilted her head some to me. \"You've been over in the Ukraine for longer than you normally stay for a project.\" she noted, and I shrugged. \"Sometimes I have artist's block and need to relax some.\" I said, and she raised her head some as she eyed me. \"This wouldn't have anything to do with that mystery man does it?\" she asked slyly and I shook my head. \"No. It has nothing to do with anyone. Maybe I want to stay in the Ukraine and live there.\" I said. Her eyes flexed with shocked. \"Live there? Why?\" she asked. \"Is that a problem?\" I questioned. She shook her head. \"Of course not. I just thought you'd move into a nice place here in Los Angeles close to your brother and niece.\" she said with a smile. I grinned thinking I would definitely have to go visit Bianca while I was here. \"A girl.\" I said happily and she grinned. \"A girl. Speaking of, when are you going to have children?\" she teased, and I shrugged. \"Maybe I won't. Maybe I just want to enjoy the company of the man I'm with.\" I said. \"So there IS a man.\" she said and I patted the island and pushed off it. \"Later, auntie.\" I said and left to go visit my brother. Bianca was at a rehearsal leaving me with just Adonis. I looked around their new digs. \"Very nice, very nice indeed.\" I said smiling at him. He pushed a smile, but I could tell it wasn't all there. \"You talk to auntie?\" he asked and I nodded. \"Yeah.\" I replied and he tucked his hands in his jogging pants and shrugged. \"So? How do you feel about all this?\" he asked. I could tell in his tone he was upset and hurt and wanted me to be upset as well. I sighed and shook my head. \"I didn't like it of course. I snapped at her. But I realize, she has been in our corner every step of the way. She never said our ideas were stupid or our questions were dumb. She didn't have to do anything for us, but she did.\" I said and he looked down with a soft frown and I moved over to him wrapping my arms around him embracing his warm. \"I understand you're angry but know you and I have done stupid shit in our past and no it does not compare to the things she has done, but still she forgave us every single time.\" I pulled back and held his cheeks in my hand and he sighed heavily before nodding. \"I feel ya.\" he said. I smiled and gave his cheek a firm smack. \"Good. Now let's hit the gym, I want to see what you have prepared to take on Viktor Drago with.\" I replied. We spent most of the day working out and when Bianca came home, we went to dinner. It was nice. The warmth of L.A. almost made me miss it. But I missed Viktor more. Due to different time zones, I told Viktor my plane information on when I would be returning so at least he knew when we could make plans to see each other again. It was nice getting to see them again. \"So when are you done with your photo project?\" Adonis asked as we moved back to his apartment. I shrugged. \"Soon I guess. Why?\" I asked. He's never been really interested in my work, but I was never too invested in his boxing career either. \"You know you being over there by yourself. I get worried for my baby sister.\" he said, and I smiled. \"I'll be alright. Nothing to worry about.\" I reassured. The days seemed to blend together like the different colors of my colored pencils in my old sketch books. As I looked out the window of the plane, I could see we were starting to land. Snow caked the ground below, and I wondered what would happen if we ever tried to land on ice. It was a quiet exit off and into the terminal that led everyone into the airport. I was looking around for the terminal that would lead me to the garage where my car was. As I managed to move past the busy people speeding around the ground, I noticed someone familiar standing in front of the terminal. I paused as a smile slowly spread across my face. There he was, looking around with his natural curious young eyes. People past him and he moved back and forward to get out the way, nodding politely at people passing by. He was waiting for me. I wasn't expecting that at all. Finally, his head turns and he sees me. Immediately, a wide smile spreads across his face as we approach each other. In a matter of seconds, we're standing right in front of each other, me looking up and him looking down. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked with surprise in my tone. He shrugged, his soft smile remaining on his face. \"I come to surprise you. Figure you can see a happy face on your arrival back.\" he explained. That's right, we are in an actual relationship. We weren't a secret here like my aunt and his father were years ago. No one truly knew us, so no one really cared. I placed my hands on his thick arms and stood up on my tip toes leaning in to taste his lips. Oh how I have missed them. Viktor's arms slowly wrapped around me hugging me close to his body. Our time together was like a montage or at least that's how I envisioned it. When he was not engrossed in hard training, he was with me. We would sit on the floor of my living room and draw or even color. It soothed him, he told me. He liked the simplicity of our silence and our drawings. He was not at sketching. Sometimes, he and I would run around the neighborhood. He was definitely faster than me and I was totally out of shape. I would slow down and hunch over, resting my palms on my knees and he'd come back jogging in front of me attempting to encourage me to push on. I would try and then already slow down again. One day he moved up to me and squatted in front of me. \"Get on.\" he said and I didn't even hesitate jumping on his back. His arms held my thighs tight as he pushed forward, my finger pointing out to an unknown destination. But our romantic times were slowly coming to an end with his fight against my brother. It was in a week, their fight, and Viktor had been training harder than he ever has. I knew this could be the last day I see him until I see him in the ring. We had just finished making love and we were curled into one another, his arm wrapped around my head allowing his fingers to entangle into my hair. We were both silent not wanting to break the beauty of the quiet in the room after it was once filled with hot and passionate moans and grunts. \"Whatever happens tomorrow just know, it is all for sport.\" Viktor says lowly. I closed my eyes at his words. \"It's just a fight. Nothing more nothing less.\" I replied quietly. \"Drago vs. Creed.\" he mentioned and I nodded. \"Yeah thanks for the reminder.\" I replied lifting my head up to look up at him. My worry was still there in my eyes and I would not try and hide it. It was too strong a feeling. Viktor saw this and placed his forehead against mine, his eyes staring at me intently. \"Trust me.\" he said softly and his eyes were so innocent almost. I couldn't help but trust him. I nodded gently. \"I trust you.\" I replied before leaning in and kissing him passionately. But nothing in the world could prepare me for what happened at that fight.[Chapter 15] 15 Normal POV He was crazy, he had to be crazy right? Viktor's hand held the small black box in his hand while he had one maybe two minutes to himself before his father and a few other trainers hired by Buddy Marcelle came in to prepare him for this fight. He was insane and knew this was a fast and impulsive, but he just felt it. Deep down, Astrid was the one. All the time she was gone, he felt like he was in a void, or a black hole he couldn't climb out of. Women tried to get his attention, but he felt nothing but annoyance by their flirtatious gaze. Astrid's eyes were pure and truthful. Besides there had been nothing but bad blood between the Dragos and Creeds. Maybe this would end it all. And if it didn't then who cared, they could have their world. He and Astrid will create their own. He could hear the crowd cheering above him and he lifted his head to listen to them. This was what he was training his whole life for. He was ready to start a new chapter in his life, a career and hopefully a deeper relationship with Astrid. He knew she was up there, waiting for him. He could hear his team coming and so he quickly placed the small black box in his locker inside his black gym bag. He would ask her when the match was over. Once Viktor was ready, he was following his team out of the room, when Ivan's thick old hand stopped him. Viktor looked back at him and his father gave an old but stern glare. \"Keep your head clear son.\" he demanded. Viktor looked him over some with a light scowl, not ready to truly challenge his father. \"It's clear.\" he said and Ivan tilted his head in disbelief. \"When I was a fighter in that ring with Apollo, I was distracted by her . You should let that girl go? Why can't you see that she is not good for you?\" he asked. Viktor looked away some feeling he was almost unable to speak before looking back at his father. \"Because I love her.\" he replied as if it was common knowledge. Ivan's face tensed some at his son's words. Viktor only turned and moved down the hall, hitting his gloves hard together. The crowd was loud and ready for the fight of a lifetime. The announcer was giving his thoughts on the fight. \"Folks, this is a fight in history we never thought would happen, but prayed for nonetheless. Viktor Drago, son of the once famous Ivan Drago will be fighting Adonis Creed, son of legendary Apollo Creed who was actually killed by Drago himself over thirty years ago.\" he explained. \"And here comes the Creed family now taking their seats in the VIP section. Now leading the family is matriarch, Alicia Victoria Creed, sister of Apollo. Following behind her is Adonis' sister, Astrid Creed, and with her the newly engaged Bianca Taylor.\" Astrid's POV I was sitting between Bianca and Aunt Alicia. I could see the distant look in her face as Viktor and Ivan Drago took the stage. The entire room was brought to life, by their presence. I noticed my aunt curl her fingers tightly. She was nervous and I could only imagine. The roaring crowd must bring back memories she was hoping to forget. Adonis finally rolled in with his team. Both teams remained in their corner, talking and giving the fighters word of encouragement. I looked at Viktor to see the stone look in his eyes. He looked fierce and dangerous. I wasn't going to lie and say I wasn't worried. I was very worried, more so afraid for my brother. The size and muscle difference alone made me regret even agreeing to be here. Rocky didn't come and boy would I love to be where he is right now. The bell rang and now it had begun. Boxing was always so fast for me, but I always tried to pay attention for my brother. The two danced around a bit, Adonis trying to land some punches into Viktor's sides. He wasn't moved. I watched as Adonis moved around Viktor but Viktor caught him with a few punches and they looked brutal all ready. Viktor had him in the corner throwing calculated punches. \"Out of the corner, D!\" Bianca yelled standing up now. It wasn't a good first round for Adonis as Viktor managed to land one punch right during the first bell. Why is it I could drown out the ocean like roar of the crowd and only hear the punches my brother took. I kept my fingers curled over my knees as I watched both fighters move to their corners. Adonis is panting as he rides the ropes back to his stool. Viktor just looks ready to win, ready to kill if necessary. \" Trust me.\" I had to believe this fight wouldn't end the same way my father ended. Is that what Ivan Drago wanted of his son, to kill Adonis in order to get back at Rocky for beating him. Did he blame Rocky for things not working out with my aunt? I glanced at her and saw her eyes glazed over with tears yet none fell just yet. The next round felt just as brutal as the first. Viktor was going all in, eyes filled with wild fire as he threw punch after punch at Adonis. One of his punches almost sent Adonis through the ropes, but he managed to remain inside. Bianca slowly covered her mouth looking down as if helpless. I could feel my aunt's hand curl into mine and I held her hand firmly giving her a positive look. The fight continued and my brother lay shots into Viktor, but it was like punching a piece of iron. Viktor got him in the ribs and my brother's pained face showed it all. He was weakened. The bell rang just in time and I felt my body rising up and I moved past security and over to my brother's chair. \"Adonis! It is enough!\" I cried out to him as the security pulled me back. He looked back at me with a panting face. You should never have to look at your loved one so beaten and bruised. We shared a long stare, our bond strong enough that he could read my eyes. He didn't have to prove anything to anybody. He didn't need to fight for revenge or for justice. His left eye had already shut and he looked very bad. I couldn't lose him, my twin. \"It's okay, Alicia I got him!\" Tony said as I was pulled back further. Tears streamed down my face as I felt soft hands grabbing my hands. Aunt Alicia. I let her lead me back to my seat. \"You have to believe in your brother.\" she said, her voice trembling. The next bell rang and the two fighters went at it again. Bianca and I remained on our feet watching their bodies violently move across the ring. I could paint a picture of this. Adonis is a raging fire god battling against the ice king Viktor for land and power. The two elements feuding for hundreds of years on the blue earth. Whoever wins creates a new legacy for their family. My eyes widen as I can see Adonis covered in fire due to his anger, and Viktor a pale blue figure with ice fists. He is calm and collective, but mighty and terrifying. I watch as Viktor lands a blow to Adonis' bruised ribs causing him to drop to his knees almost in defeat. My stomach tightens, and I feel my hands cover my own ribs due to imaginary pain of seeing my brother punched there. I can feel my rib piercing my lung. The pain is vicious and I am devoured by pain. I feel my twin's pain. Viktor is going for an upper cut as the ref is waving his arms for him to stop. Now it's silent all around me. There is no one else in the stadium. It's just me and Adonis, twins who have shared a womb together, who shared a juvenile cell together, who shared the world together. I feel my heart split in two and tears fall down my cheeks immediately. The roaring crowd hits my ears as if someone has smacked them both simultaneously. I don't see Adonis anymore just the ring filled with people. \"Oh no no no no.\" Aunt Alicia chants eyes filled with pure shock and dread as all her past horrors flooded back vividly. My chest hurts from the pain that's devouring me. I moved through the rows, Bianca right behind me. The arena is crowded and we are pushing past people. \"LET ME THROUGH! ADONIS!\" I cried out shoving shoulders trying to push pas the security team. My mind is a blur. From running to the stage and seeing my brother lying lifeless on the ground, to fighting against the cops as they tell me I can't ride in the ambulance with him. Viktor is not even in my head. \" Trust me.\" I could hardly think, hardly breathe as it felt the world was crashing down all around me. Aunt Alicia and Bianca were talking to the doctor and I was just sitting outside in front of the hospital. The cold hurt my face but I didn't care. I was just holding myself as I sat on the icy bench. I felt numb, so very numb. I should have seen this coming. There was no way Viktor could fight his primal instincts, his urges to win. He had to impress his father. That much I knew. It would always be about his father. I could hear heels on concrete and I looked up as my aunt was sitting down beside me. She took my hands and I just examined her face. She was tired, so very tired. \"The doctor had a lot to say, but in the end, Adonis will be okay. He will heal. It just takes time.\" she said and I closed my eyes just looked up praising God for the news. \"I don't know what I would ever do if I lost him to that ring.\" I said sniffling some and she looked at me with light eyes. \"He is strong and he is a fighter. This is his life, a fighter's life.\" she concluded tucking a piece of hair behind my ear. She looked over my shoulder and looked intently at something. I followed her gaze to see a familiar white truck moving toward the roundabout in front of us. My aunt and I stood up as we watched Viktor Drago get out of the passenger's side. Of course, his father drove and I just stood there watching as he walked onto the sidewalk over to us. Ivan got out and just stood against his door. Both were in heavy jackets trying to hide their identities. Guess it wouldn't look too good for the Drago men trying to confront the Creed women. Aunt Alicia placed her hand in front of me and stepped a few inches in front of me as if to shield me. Good lord how did this look, the two Creed women who had relations with these two Drago men. \"You two should not be here.\" Aunt Alicia stated. Ivan nodded before taking a few steps from his truck and holding his hand out to her. \"We should talk.\" he said. My aunt's brow arched perfectly. \"This is a family moment, this is really not appropriate.\" she said, and as the two talked, Ivan trying to convince her to leave with him, and my aunt denying his advances, Viktor just looked at me shyly, guiltily. \"I need to return to letters.\" Ivan suddenly said and now my attention was brought back to Ivan. He reached into the truck and pulled out the stack of envelopes. \"There is much we must talk about. We can go for walk.\" \"You have some nerve, my aunt's not going anywhere with you!\" I snapped, but Aunt Alicia raised her hand to me. \"It is alright, Astrid. It seems we all need to get some things off our chest.\" she said, her tone edgy as if she did not trust the situation, but knew this scene was bound to happen. She looked at me. \"Ivan and I will walk one lap around the hospital. By then everything will have been said.\" I looked at her stunned before looking away with mixed feelings about this. After everything that has happened, Adonis needed us. But Bianca was with him, so I guess this was the perfect time to give them space. I didn't want to know what they would speak about. I watched the two approach each other and slowly they began to stroll onto the road. They stood so close to each other, and I don't even think they noticed. Even after all of this, they couldn't deny their feelings. It looked almost natural for them to be so close. Now Viktor was standing over me and I just looked up at him and tensed with anger. \"Astrid-\" but that's all he could say before my hand connected with his cheek. His face hardly moved from the action, but he got the message. \"That is for convincing me to trust you.\" I said sharply before turning and moving back toward the hospital. However, my wrist was grabbed and I whipped back to see him staring at me with those big eyes. \"Astrid, it was not my intent to hurt your brother. I demanded that my father bring me here to see how your brother was.\" he pled, as I tore my hand from his hold. \"So ask!\" I snapped and he winced at my tone. \"How is he?\" he asked. I glared at him too busy thinking about my aunt going off with his father. \"He will survive, his wounds will heal. It seems you couldn't see daddy's plan after all.\" I said. He frowned now. \"You think my father wanted to kill your brother… using me?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" I said without much thought. \"I saw it in your eyes the sheer focus, the want to win by any means necessary. If that punch to my brother had ended his life, taking him from me, your father would not bat an eye.\" He stared at me angrily before shaking his head. \"My dad may want a lot of things and he may be a lot of things, but he would not stoop so low.\" he said. \"God I half expected you to say \"he is not a killer\" but what difference does it make? You hated my brother in that ring. You wanted to do every horrible thing imaginable to him.\" \"That is not true.\" \"Oh yeah?\" \"Yeah! I was going to win! I knew it, I could have easily defeated your brother.\" he said. \"And what happened?\" I asked angrily. I was finding it harder and harder to control my feelings and anger. \"You happened! You got inside my head. I planned to demolish your brother the legal way- the right way, but knew if I did that, the damage could have been a lot worst. You got inside my head with your art and your beautiful soul.\" he said raising his hands at my accusingly and I scoffed. \"Don't use me as an excuse.\" I said and he shook his head. \"It is the only truth I know. This way, neither of us lose. He remains champ and I remain nothing.\" he said, his tone lowering as he tucks his hands inside his jacket looking away. I stared at the side of his cheek for a moment taking in his words. Whether he planned this or not, the damage was done. My brother was going to need a lot of strength to overcome this. We just stood there now, me looking at him and him just looking off in the direction of our elders. I thought back to our times together before any of this happened. He was always determined, always head strong. \"You've never been nothing.\" I said finally and he slowly faced me. \"You re Viktor Drago and only you can make a name for yourself. Your father can only do so much for you.\" I didn't even know where I was going with this before I slowly walked beside him, my hands rubbing my shoulder. \"I can't believe you two even showed up.\" I added. Viktor shrugged. \"The only reason he truly came here was for her.\" he said motioning his head in their direction. I looked down in thought of his words. \"We're never going to keep them a part.\" I said allowed accepting that there was nothing I could do or say to stop my aunt from loving his father. \"I would never stop him.\" he said and glanced up at him confused. \"Really? Why wouldn't you?\" I asked now genuinely curious of his statement. Now his eyes were soft and gentle, the same gentle stare that always managed to arouse me with some kind of deep inner emotion. \"Because she makes him happy, despite the horrible past that brought them together. Because there is nothing he could ever tell me that justifies getting me to stop loving you.\" he explained. My eyes flickered in shock at his words and I looked away some. \"How do you know I still love you after what you did?\" I asked. Would I let myself believe he planned to get himself disqualified to spare me pain of losing my brother, to spare him pain from losing his title. I felt my hand being raised up and pressed against his chest suddenly, causing me to be pulled in to him a bit. \"You love me.\" he stated. \"And I love you and if somehow this has pushed you from me, then I will show you how much I will forever love you by drawing for you and painting you pictures of all the things I feel when I look at you, at the butterflies that flutter in my stomach at the thought of you.\" I could feel tears falling down my cheeks as I knew he was opening himself up to me. He couldn't draw, but I knew he would try. \"I give you pictures to put back up in your apartment.\" he continued gently. \"I will draw rainbows and puppies and kittens-\" He was starting to babble now and I knew he was going to embarrass himself and so I hooked my fingers around his neck and pulled him into me, our lips crashing together swiftly. His lips tasted of blood from his fight and I didn't care. His arms wrapped around me pulling me into him as I felt my hands wrap around his neck. I pulled back inches from his lips, our foggy eyes staring at each other as our hands never let each other go. \"I could hate you and be justified in it… but to hate you would mean hurting us both.\" I whispered before feeling his lips devour mine again. Author's notes And let's not forget Rocky had come to visit Adonis in the hospital. Should be fun![Chapter 16] 16 Alicia's POV The air was cold tonight and I ran my fingers over my shoulders through my coat. Thank god for these gloves. \"You're freezing. Take my coat.\" Ivan said lowly, and I looked up at him stunned. He began to shed his coat and I shook my head. \"No. You will be cold. Can't have your son thinking I am trying to make you ill.\" I said stopping him by placing a hand on his much larger one. Our walking had slowed and he looked down at me for a moment before shaking his head. \"This is all wrong. This should not have been our future.\" I closed my eyes some looking down in thought. \"We cannot change the past. You have chosen your path and I have chosen mine.\" I said looking back up and continuing to move on the dark pavement. I felt his hand suddenly curl around mine. He hasn't moved so my body stopped once again. I feel the warmth of his hand moving up my body and I tense a bit, remembering the feelings he gave me with the lightest of touches. But I was not a young girl anymore. \"If we could do it all over again would you?\" he asked, his tone almost desperate. I turned to him slowly and looked up at him. To ask that meant if I could watch my brother die in the ring all those years ago, could I do it. \"I would… like some things to be different.\" I replied and he nodded. \"Of course.\" he replied already knowing my thoughts. He pulls me in to him and I let him. With his other hand he opens his jacket and just embraces me inside and I sighed softly as I feel my head curl under his chin. His question still played in my head some. To do it all over again and be with him could mean I may not have met Astrid or Adonis. I would have Alexander, but I couldn't picture my life without all three of them. \"I could not picture my life without those kids… or our son. And you cannot picture your life without Viktor.\" I replied looking up at him slowly. He shifted just a bit so he could look down at me. His eyes are tired and old. He's still fighting. Fighting a war to be the greatest. But I could tell he agreed with me. \"Will we ever be able to… be together?\" he asked. And that was a question I truly did not know how to answer. I had moved on from him and even though I never dated or married after him, I had still decided to continue my photography and live the best life I could with Alexander. Even after the twins, I was still fulfilled and had purpose. I shook my head slowly. \"I do not know.\" I replied honestly. He deserved at least that much. He nodded slowly and I sighed some and thought of Astrid. I felt she would start to worry if I did not come back around soon. I hesitantly pulled back from Ivan and looked him over. \"You can keep the letters if you want. The pictures inside were meant for you.\" He gave a small tired smirk. \"I was never planning to give them back.\" he replied and I nodded slowly. \"Good.\" I replied and he raised his hand to me and without much thought, I took it and we continued our walk on the dark sidewalk around the hospital. \"Your nephew… okay?\" he asked. I nodded slowly. \"He will live.\" I replied. I was sure Bianca needed me in there and when I let Ivan know he agreed. He motioned to a door that would lead us back inside. I pulled out my phone and messaged Astrid letting her know I was heading back inside. She told me she had went home to rest and that she had told Bianca the same and that I went to clear my head a bit. Good girl. As we moved down the hall of the first floor, I noticed how many people were staring at us. I looked up at Ivan and realized our hands were still locked together. I slowly removed my hand from him and looked up at him. \"You don't have to stay Ivan.\" I replied. Before he could speak his head lifted and he frowned slightly above me. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" I heard the angry voice of Rocky boom. Well somewhat for a guy his age. I turned to see him moving up to us swiftly. Already his body became a wall separating Ivan and I who frowned at this. \"I come to pay respects.\" he said. \"Hey Adonis isn't dead! You got no right to be here!\" Rocky said pointing his finger at Ivan's face. Ivan frowned more. \"Get out of my face Balboa.\" he said lowly. \"I ain't scared of you! You may have gotten Apollo killed, but you ain't taking his son from us! I knocked you out once I will do it again!\" he shouted. My face fell at his words and Ivan replied with a shove. Rocky stumbled back before throwing a swing at Ivan and now the two were throwing punches. \"Stop it!\" I screamed as they were knocking over medical supplies. Nurses were hurrying out of the way and I stepped back as these two older men duked it out. Astrid's POV Viktor and I took a cab back to my place. He felt if he left his dad's truck he wouldn't be so mad for ditching him at the hospital. He was sure with my aunt there, what's the worst that could happen. We hurried back to my room, his hand guiding us there. I unlocked the door and we moved inside quickly. Viktor raised me over his shoulders and carried me to my room. I shouldn't be so happy right? I mean this monster of a man put my brother in the hospital. But he would live. His father killed my father, but my aunt lived. There was so much animosity when the names Creed and Drago were tossed around. So much animosity for over thirty years. Maybe it was time to end all that. Viktor lied me on my bed and just grabbed the sides of my pants and attempted to yank them down, but I was in jeans. My entire body slid down the bed with his movements causing him to blush with embarrassment at his failed attempted. I leaned up and kissed him quickly before reaching down to his sweats and pulling them down. He reached down for the buttons on my pants and snapped them off. Once both our pants were off, Viktor reached down to take my shoes off, as he kicked his own shoes off. I smiled as we were naked in a matter of seconds. Viktor crawled into me, using his forehead against mine to gently push me back onto the bed. His lips found mine immediately, our mouths opened and we let out tongues slide across one another. I feel one of his hands cupping my breasts as our groins rub against one another. Our families can be out there causing war… but right here in this room, in this bed, there is only love. But suddenly, Viktor pulls back and looked at me with nervous eyes as he pulls back. I looked him over sitting up with him. \"What's wrong?\" I asked letting my hand slide over his shoulder lightly. He looked at his knees for a second before getting up and moving over to his pile of clothes. Was he leaving? Why wasn't he saying anything. He lifts up his hoody and starts to look through it. \"What are you doing?\" \"I can't wait any longer. I have to do this.\" he said quickly, and I looked him over. \"Do what?\" I asked and he reaches into one of the pockets and pulls something out. His hand is covering it so I can't see it. But he gets back on the bed and looks at me. \"Do you love me?\" he asked suddenly and I stared into his eyes intently and nodded. \"Of course, I do.\" I said and he nodded quickly taking uneven breaths. What was going on. \"I love you and I know our families have been feuding for quite a long time. But I have never felt I even had a true family until I met you. I can't live on this earth without you in it. I cannot love anything else if something were to happen to you. I was ready to kill Ricky Conlan, a fighter I had only dreamed of meeting one day, for you, a Creed.\" he said, and he finally raised his hand to me and revealed a black box. He opened it though and my attention was brought to what was inside. It was a petite diamond halo and split band, with an oval diamond. Even in this dim lit room it was beautiful. My mouth dropped and I looked up at Viktor. This wasn't happening. \"Let's end this feud between us for good.\" he said. \"Will you marry me?\" I stared at his face for the longest time feeling my body frozen and my voice taken from me. I leaned in to him and kissed him hard, wrapping my arms around his neck. I feel his arms wrap around me and I pull back a few inches from him. \"Yes.\" I replied. Once the word left my lips, I thought about the anger that I would receive from my brother and Rocky, and the disappointment from Bianca and my aunt. How could I marry the enemy? Simple. By just saying yes.[Chapter 17] 17 The sun's rays slowly crept onto my face. I now see light through my lids and I gently open them. Viktor's arm is across my chest holding me to him. I can feel his chin on my head. Last night… was it a dream? I gently raised my left hand to see the beautiful ring shining on my ring finger. I bit my bottom lip trying to contain my excitement. So, it was real. After a few minutes, Viktor began to stir and his arm unraveled from me. He rolled onto his side so his back was facing me and I smiled and gently sat up. My body was mildly stiff. Viktor's hand came around to gently rub my bare back. \"Good morning.\" he said drowsily. I smiled back at him to see he had turned back around to face me. I could see why, his phone was buzzing like crazy. It was most likely his father. I glanced from his phone to him. \"You gonna get that?\" I asked and he turned around to grab his phone. Only this time, he cut it off. I was stunned by this and he sat up and looked at me with tired, yet intense eyes. \"Today will be about you and me.\" he said before leaning in and lightly grazing my lips with is. I smiled and nodded slowly returning the morning kiss. We got up and got dressed, me in his shirt, and him in his boxers. We ate cereal and laughed at things from our child hood. After that, we got dressed and went out for a jog. The was crisp and cold and burned nose so I wore one of my scarves over his face. I was starting to keep up with him now. But I knew he slowed himself just for me. He could do so much more. People saw us, but we didn't see them. Once that was done, we stared at each other in the shower as the water just sprayed us with praise. His hands slid down the curves of my side and I just rested the side of my face on his chest as I held him. Maybe we did things in different order, because as soon as we were clean and in bed, Viktor took me so quick. I cried out as I moved my hips atop of his, his hands hold onto mine. His eyes were dark and filled with lust and love. After all of that, we showered again and then went to lunch at this nice little Italian hold in the wall kind of place. Now reality began to set in and I realized he could see the worry on my face. \"What's wrong?\" he asked taking a bite of his large slice of pepperoni and sausage pizza. I sighed gently leaning back in my booth. \"Should we tell our families of what we plan to do?\" I asked. I mean his dad was going to be angry. My brother and Uncle Rocky would be angry. I wasn't so sure about my aunt, but who knows. There are so many possibilities. He swallowed what was in his mouth and exhaled gently. \"We should tell them.\" he said and I winced some. \"You're not worried about what your dad may say?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"He cannot stop me. I don't care what happens as long as I am marrying you.\" he said holding his hand out across the table to me. I don't know why, but I felt even better after this talk. He wasn't worried, so why should I be? I reached over and let out hands connect. \"I'm sure your father is going to be looking for you.\" I replied and he nodded. \"He will be. I have other fights coming up soon and I must prepare for them. But I have time. Will you be there… at my fights?\" he asked. I thought about this for a second. Me being there could cause attention and people will get curious of why the daughter of Apollo Creed is attending fights where Ivan Drago and his son are participating in. Well maybe that's what is supposed to happen. I nodded. \"I will be there.\" I replied. A wide smile came across my lips. \"Good. But I have one more thing to ask of you.\" he said and I tilted my head. \"Hm?\" I asked curiously. Now I could see he was nervous. \"You have to be with me when I tell my father about us.\" he said. Oh shit. Now worry flooded back inside me and I nodded. \"Only if you stay with me, while I make my phone calls to my family.\" I replied. He nodded. \"Da.\" he said. Speaking of family, I realized my Aunt was still here at a hotel close by here. \"We should tell my aunt first. If anything she had no room to judge. Maybe telling her first would be better. Adonis could wait, he needed to heal first and this would stress him out. After we ate, I went over to the very nice hotel my aunt stayed in. She had me as one of the guests who were allowed a key to her room and so we moved up the stairs to her room door. I knocked on it gently. \"Aunt Alicia?\" I asked softly taking the key and opening the door. Maybe she was still asleep. Viktor followed me inside and on instinct I flipped the light switch on and the lights flooded on. I heard a yelp from across the room and both Viktor and I stopped as we saw a sight I had never thought I would see before. My aunt sitting up quickly with the blankets covering her nude form. Sitting up right beside her in shock was the villainous douche bag, Ivan Drago. God it was like looking into the future seeing our older counter parts here or something. \"Oh ew.\" I said and quickly turned and left out the door. \"Wait, Astrid!\" my aunt called out. Viktor in utter shock, I had to take his hand to guide him from the room. The door closed behind us and my mind finally decided to tell me that my eyes saw the sprawled-out clothes everywhere on the ground. \"Oh my god.\" Viktor said, hands on hips and looking around as if searching for the answers to what he had just seen. We both just stood outside the door while we heard rumbling and whispers from inside. The door cracked open now to Ivan's face. \"Come back inside.\" he said, his tone restrained like he wanted to command us, but was refraining. Viktor looked at him and whispered. \" Why don't you get dressed before we come back in there.\" he said harshly. Ivan looked down, as if looking at himself. \" Fair point.\" he said and closed the door. Viktor rubbed his face and just placed himself against the wall. After a few minutes, Viktor and I were standing across the bed where my aunt and his father were sitting down. My aunt was in her silk robe while Ivan was in boxers and a shirt. We were very quiet and had no idea what to say. Aunt Alicia looked up at me. \"Are you honestly surprised?\" she asked. I crossed my arms now and looked down. \"No. I am not.\" I replied looking up at Viktor who just glared down at his father. I could tell how upset he was. Ivan already thought I wasn't good for Viktor, but here he was probably was balls deep in my aunt. Oh no mental image! I closed my eyes and groaned at my thoughts. Ivan raised his hand toward Viktor. \"Look there are things you don't understand-\" \"I understand clearly! You said Astrid wasn't good enough and that she would only distract me and here you are with her!\" he snapped. My aunt looked at Ivan with a sharp glare. \"You said what?\" she asked acidly standing up now. Ivan looked at my aunt now taking her hand gently. \"I was only trying to protect my son. So he did not turn out like I did.\" he said. I shook my head. \"Look none of that matters right now! Viktor and I are getting married.\" I blurted. Now Ivan and Aunt Alicia looked at me with wide eyes, Ivan standing up. \"What!\" they both shouted. Viktor stepped toward me, wrapping an arm around my hip. \"You heard her. She and I love each other. And neither of you are in a position to stop us.\" he said. \"Papa… I want to fight and be the greatest, and I want you to be in my corner while I fight my way to victory… but I want Astrid at my side when I do it, too.\" He then looked at my aunt and his eyes were respectful. \"And I want your blessing to marry her.\" he added. I smiled up at Viktor before looking at my aunt. She just stared up at my large fiancé stunned, and then looked at Ivan who just crossed his arms in thought of his own. \"It seems there is a lot to take in today.\" she admitted before looking at Viktor. \"If I didn't give you my blessing, would you still marry her?\" Viktor nodded slowly. \"Yes.\" he said and my aunt nodded slowly placing her hands on her hips. \"Then that's all that needs to be said.\" she said. Ivan shook his head. \"You are not ready to handle marriage.\" he said. My aunt looked at him with a slight frown. \"What do you know about being married, happily married?\" he asked. Ivan's face for once was shocked. He was definitely caught off guard by his son's words. He looked my aunt and nodded at her before taking my hand and pulling me to the door. There was nothing else to say. They had their issues to deal with. It had nothing to do with us. Author's Notes To the guest asking about the Underworld fic, I am sorry, but I have not seen that movie. And gaaah I want to tell you guys so bad how things end with Ivan and Alicia, but I can't spoil it for you xD[Chapter 18] Author's Notes I am going to go ahead and let everyone know the last chapter is the last we are going to see an Ivan/Alicia pov or anything about them until the end of the fic itself. Also this first scene of the fic, I am listening to the Tarzan Score \"One Family\" I do not know why it definitely illuminates the love of Astrid and Viktor. 18 Viktor and I left the hotel and headed over to my car. We were both walking with anger and other emotions. I used my car's electronic key to unlock the car. Viktor was polite enough to open the driver's door for me and let me in before walking around to the other side and getting in himself. I don't even know why I was so angry. Maybe it was because I thought that my aunt and Ivan were done, they had left their lustful ways in the past. My next move was to angrily put my keys in the ignition, but I paused in my movements and looked at Viktor to see him just staring at the front of my car with anger in his eyes. His knuckles were white as they rubbed across the top of his pants. I could only imagine the pain he was feeling. I reached over and placed my hand over his left fist. He stopped and looked at me. My anger washed away as my eyes stared at his hurt features. \"Tell me how you feel.\" I said and he just growls and looks away. \"My dad is such a fucking hypocrite. To say we cannot be together but then goes and sleeps with your aunt.\" he said slowly shaking his head and looking away. \"I feel so torn.\" I stared at him for a moment before glancing at the back of my car. \"Hey come sit in the back with me.\" I said moving to open my door. Viktor looked at me confused, but slowly followed my actions and we both moved to sit in the back seat. Once there, I gently grabbed his shoulders and pulled him over to me so his head could rest against my body. He didn't even fight it, he just melted into me and we lied back against my side of the window. I thought about what we had just experienced and felt I somewhat understood. \"What they have together, it is not lust.\" I said gently and he looked up at me with deep sensual eyes. \"It is love.\" He winced gently and just leaned in holding me tighter to him. I wrapped my arms around him gently running my hand over his head. \"They couldn't stay away from each other… like we cannot stay away from each other.\" I explained lightly. I knew it didn't entirely make him feel better, but he wasn't so tense. \"All my life I've only known to fight with these.\" he said holding his fist up in front of him a bit. I stared at his hand for a second gently resting my hand over it. \"And now you have me.\" I replied and he sat his head up again, staring at me gently. \"And now I have you.\" he replied and we smiled gently at each other and he leaned in to me kissing me passionately and lovingly and I replied wrapping my arms around his neck softly. When the day was over, Viktor and I separated. He had to talk to his father and I had to go see my brother. I was at the hospital staring at him with wet eyes as he was awake, and propped up by his bed. He looked so tired and defeated. \"Hey don't start crying then I'm gonna emotional and cry.\" Adonis said. He looked better today. I gave a weak smile. \"The doctors said in a few weeks you can go home. Are you going to keep training?\" I asked lightly and he just looked forward, his eyes showing discouragement. \"I don't know. Right now I kind of don't want to think about anything.\" he said. He shook his head. \"Can't believe he got me after the bell.\" His face was different colors, his swelling gone down from his eye. I shushed him gently resting my hand on his shoulder. \"Do not think about that right now. You need to keep your stress down.\" I replied and he nodded giving a weak smile before his eyes looked down to my hand. The light flashed off the ring and his eyes caught it immediately. I tensed now and pulled my hand back, but his arm was just fast enough to lightly catch my forearm. His eyes showed immediate confusion as he looked from my hand to my face. \"Yo, what's this?\" he asked. I shrugged pulling my hand back. \"Nothing. Just a ring.\" I replied. He side eyed me a bit. \"Just a ring. I know just a ring. That ain't just no ring. You getting married?\" he asked and I just stared at him for a moment before looking down at the ground softly. I couldn't hide anything from him anymore. I then looked back up at him with calm and steady eyes. \"Yes. Viktor Drago and I have been dating long before I knew you two were fighting. He and I are going to marry.\" I replied. As I spoke he slowly shook his head, eyes watering now as he looked away confused and lost. I just watched his face for a second. \"Leave.\" he said. My body tightened at his words. We needed to talk about this. \"Donnie-\" \"GET OUT! I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW! I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!\" he shouted angrily. My body jerked a bit at his words and I felt my own tears swelling in my eyes. Donnie's lips quivered as he held back his own tears and I just swallowed and turned and sped from the room. Bianca was just coming back in. \"Astrid?\" she asked as I just moved past her and left down the hall. Tears streamed down my face as I began to sob and run down the hall. People looked at me sympathetically as if knowing I had lost someone. I had rushed out into the cold, my jacket on my arm. Once I reached the car, I touched the side of it, leaned over it and cried out in pain. My tears were really hot in this temperature. I hurried and put my coat on and got in the car. I couldn't believe this was happening. My phone was vibrating and I saw my aunt calling. Ignore. Viktor calls right after. Accept. \"Hello?\" I asked sniffling. \"What's wrong?\" he immediately asks, and I just cry even harder now. When the moon was up, I just sat on my couch, my hair swept over my shoulder. Viktor came back from the kitchen with one of my mugs in his hand. He handed it to me and I smiled up at him. \"Thank you.\" I replied and he nodded sitting beside me. We both had a rough day. \"I am sorry your brother yelled at you.\" he said rubbing the top of my knee. I sniffled some. \"I am sorry your father still yelled at you.\" I replied. He nodded slowly. \"He doesn't want his life to become mine. Afraid something will happen to split us up like he and your aunt.\" he explained lowly and I looked down thinking about his words. \"And Balboa is still on his mind. He is the blame for everything even though he cannot look in the mirror at himself. He is trying to get back in the good graces of my mother.\" He scowled some and I looked back up at him. \"Your mother?\" I asked and he nodded slowly. \"I don't understand why. They never cared about us- she never cared. And now my father wants to kiss their ass so he can rise up again into fame and glory.\" I sipped my hot chocolate as I listened. \"And what do you want?\" I asked lowly and he looked back at me with some sort of realization. \"No one's really ever asked me that who cares for me. Not my dad, not promoters or coaches. Just you.\" he said. I smiled gently at him and he shook his head. \"I want to fight. I like to fight. And I want to win.\" he said and I swallowed some at his words. \"And you will. And I will be behind you every step of the way.\" I promised and he smiled at me as I smiled back. \"I have to start training again. Still have more fights scheduled… when I am not fighting or training, we discuss wedding?\" he asked. I nodded happily. \"Okay.\" I replied. That thought alone, brought happiness into me even after being turned away by my twin. The thought of waking up to him every day for the rest of my life made me so happy. \"Will you come to a few of my training sessions and fights?\" he asked now a bit more encouraged. Now I was worried. \"Wait, what about the public? I can only imagine the type of scandal that will happen if we go public.\" I replied. He shrugged. \"What scandal? I don't care about what others think. My fighting alone will pave my way in the arena.\" he said. I shook my head now scooting closer to him. \"But you should. What if you aren't booked for a fight. A lot of people will feel betrayed because of what your father did to mine and that could have consequences we don't know about.\" I reminded. He inhaled sharply and looked away. \"I don't want you hurt.\" he said and then looked back at me. \"We will keep our relationship quiet for a bit longer. But still come to my matches?\" I figured it wouldn't be too hard to see his matches unnoticed. I nodded smiling warmly. \"Deal.\" I replied.[Chapter 19] 19 Days passed into weeks. Adonis was back home and Bianca and Aunt Alicia were blowing up my phone with worries and questions. 'How long have you been dating Viktor?' 'Donnie hasn't been himself?' 'Are you getting married in America?' 'I feel like I'm handling this pregnancy all on my own.' 'Have you spoken to your brother?' 'It's like he's in a dark place.' 'Please talk to him, Astrid.' 'Talk to him, dear.' Adonis wouldn't answer his phone and that was okay. I would give him his space. He was taking his loss to Viktor hard. But that did not stop me from sending him encouraging texts to him every now and again, to show I was still here for him. Bianca sent me pictures of her ultra sounds. A girl. She was having a beautiful girl. I was talking to my aunt more as well. She wanted to talk wedding plans details. I had nothing to tell her yet… I was watching one of Viktor's fights now as he demolished his opponent. My heart was racing and I was in a state of shock but it was not because of the violence before me or the blood everywhere. It was not because of the crowd roaring around me, but because of the positive pregnancy test I held close to my heart. My mind was a blank as I stared up at the arena. I didn't even see anyone in that ring. I just saw myself staring back at me naked and round bellied. I was gently massaging my stomach. I am the Giver. Viktor is standing behind me in this vision, his hands wrapped gently around my body as my head leans back into his warm embrace. Tears fell down my cheek immediately as I slowly got up and began to move through the aisle again, holding the test hard so nothing would knock it from my hand. \"AND VIKTOR DRAGO TAKES ANOTHER VICTORY!\" the announcer yells over my head. The audience is wild, but their hard noises don't phase me and I just walk into the aisle and slowly began to walk toward the ring. I'm in a daze and no one is blocking me. But I am getting closer to the security guard who stops me and I just stopped and back away a few steps. I looked at the ring as Viktor is standing in the middle of it, his father and trainers are all around him. He's giving an interview, but I see his eyes searching the crowd for me. I swallow some and just stand there watching him hoping he finds my form. He keeps talking until his eyes finally look to the aisle and we connect. He seems my look of shock and I sniffle some and slowly raise the positive test to him. His body freezes, his father looking at him confused before following his eyes to me. My hand shakes with the test in it. Viktor just looks at me stunned before moving from the reporter and moving beneath the ring. Hands reach out to touch Viktor as if a God is coming to them. But no, he is coming to me. His body is covered in sweat and he has minor cuts on his face as he approaches me. He already knows what he's risking by doing this. I know what he's risking by doing this. He removes his gloves and tosses them to the ground, his eyes never leaving mine as a smile comes across his face. I cry out in happiness as he takes hold of my face and kisses me hard. Now everyone is gasping as they have no choice but to watch. My hands rest on his wrists as I replied. \" Are you really pregnant?\" he asked. I nodded quickly. \" Yes.\" I replied and he gave a cry of joy as he pressed his forehead into mine kissing me again. His arms wrapped around me. Cameras and reporters flooded around us, but I didn't care. And from the joy in Viktor's eyes, he didn't either. He didn't care about his father's glare at the back of his head either. The papers were filled with pictures of our little display the next day. At first I was the girlfriend or the mystery love. Day later it was finally out there, written into existence. \"Drago-Creed affair exposed\" \"Viktor Drago is dating daughter of famous Apollo Creed\" \"Drago son knocked up Creed daughter\". It was very hard going home without someone wanting an interview. I fought them off. But now American journalists were calling, random people were calling. All wanting to know how I could betray my father's legacy by being with the son of the man who killed him. Was I not my own woman? Am I simply my father's daughter? Viktor got mild back lash, but it was because he was winning his matches and making everyone proud. \"Honey, maybe you should come back to America for a while and stay with me. Crazy fans are in every state. I don't want anything to happen to you especially while you're pregnant.\" Aunt Alicia said and I sighed as I paced around my room. \"I'm not going anywhere, auntie. I'm not afraid.\" I replied. \"It doesn't matter if you're afraid. You are halfway across the world from me and I just don't want anything to happen to you. You have no protection or family-\" \"I have Viktor.\" I replied and there was a short pause. \"Do you have doctors and all of that ready? Do you know where you're going to deliver the baby? You need a strong support group for this, Astrid. You are going to experience quite a lot in the next nine months and I want you to be ready.\" she said. I inhaled softly. \"If I need anything, I will call you.\" I replied. \"Okay darling.\" she replied. I hung up and now moved to the bathroom and just stared at myself for a moment. I honestly, didn't want a child when I was in school. I told myself I wouldn't date anyways so I wouldn't have to worry about being pregnant. I could just have my money and not worry. But now that I'm faced with it, I had much to think about. I can't do this, I felt, before looking at my stomach and letting my hands rest on it. Yes I can. This child has an artist for a mother and a boxer for a father. He or she will always be taken care of and will always have my love. Immediately after Viktor's fight we made our way back to my place to discuss what was to happen. I told him I did not want him to stop fighting or training. \" I am not going to let you go through a single minute of this by yourself.\" \" You have to. You have your days off and we can schedule doctor's appointments. \" I can't believe you're going to have a baby. We… are having a baby.\" I had never seen him so happy. But I also know this is new for both of us and I knew by now the reality would set in. I needed to get out of my head for a while, so I packed a small black bag with my bathing suit and left my apartment. There was a gym not too far from here that I could go to. I sent Viktor a text of where I was going so he would know where I was. There was no journalist or reporters here or at the gym, thank god. Once inside and situated, I walked down the steps of the pool's shallow end. It was cold and new to me. I hadn't felt this in a long time. I walked around a bit in the water merely enjoying the coolness on my skin. I stuck my hands out and just moved about. I was surprised no other children or families were here. It's usually a popular place. But I wouldn't complain. \"Mind if I join?\" I heard him. I gave a light smile. \"You are supposed to be training.\" I said turning to him only to gasp to see he is naked and already entering the pool. \"What are you doing! You're going to get us in trouble.\" I said harshly. \"I like trouble.\" he said. Surely there was some cameras around. I'm sure if there were it would never look good for there to be a naked man stalking a woman in a pool like a predator. I moved up to him as he was moving to me with a smirk. I looked around for any pants or swim trunks. \"What are you doing?\" I asked as he wrapped his hands around my hips. His smile was so caring. \"I am being here for you.\" he answered. \"What?\" I asked confused and he inhaled. \"Your aunt called me and reminded me of the sacrifices a woman will make to give birth to baby. I don't want you to ever think you have to sacrifice alone. Because you are not alone.\" he said. Immediately, my eyes softened on his face. \"I can take care of you,\" his hand slid down to my stomach. \"Both of you.\" he said. I was shocked to hear my aunt called him. Maybe she could hear the stress in my voice from our last conversation. But hearing Viktor say that was the most caring and hottest thing anyone has ever said to me. But he was right to say it, because I knew I would feel like I would be handling this new event in our life all by myself. I leaned up and kissed him and he returned it. I now felt the courage to want to get in trouble with him. Maybe this was our last time to really be immature before parenthood takes us. I lifted my legs to slide out of my bikini bottoms and then my top came seconds later. Viktor smiled wide as I now tossed the outfit aside and began to swim back from him. He stalked toward me, his body dipping into the water so only his head was sticking out. His eyes were like a beast hunting its pray. I squealed as I attempted to run from him toward the deep in and with his massive body he thrust forward growling as he swam to chase me.[Chapter 20] 20 Within the week, Viktor had gone back to training preparing for upcoming fights. I had my TV on listening from the kitchen as I scrambled some eggs. Viktor was at some press conference. \" Viktor sources have indicated that your manager has attempted to reach out to WBC World Heavyweight Champion, Adonis Creed about scheduling another fight due to the loss in last month's fight.\" A reporter asked. \" What loss?\" Viktor asked in an icy tone. \" Well it most certainly not a win. Some say a loss is better than a disqualification.\" The reporter pressed almost smugly. I rolled my eyes moving back into the living room to sit down and watch. Viktor was in a nice suit beside his father and a few others. \" If Creed decides not to fight then it shows his cowardice.\" Ivan replied. I scoffed. \"Wouldn't be saying that if auntie were watching.\" I muttered. \" Could Creed's ducking of your fight invitation be because of the news that you are dating his sister, artist Astrid Creed?\" another reporter asked. I could see Ivan duck his head some trying to hide his scowl. \" Viktor any comment?\" the reporter asked. Viktor lifted his head some and leaned forward to the microphone. \" My relationship with Ms. Creed is my own business.\" He replied. The crowd roared with more questions of course. A woman spoke up. \" There's been talk that Astrid Creed is pregnant. Is the reason you're marrying here?\" she asked. I plucked some eggs into my mouth listening with intent while Viktor leaned in to speak. \"I am marrying her… because I love her.\" he said in English looking into a single camera. It almost felt like he was looking at me and me alone. I slowly smiled. \"And we start a family.\" Now more murmurs and chatting were heard. \" Ivan how do you feel about this surprising news? You killed the Creeds patriarch nearly 30 years ago and now your son is marrying the daughter of a Creed.\" Someone asked. \" If Creed agrees to fight Viktor and he kills him will that the marriage-\" I immediately cut off the TV and placed my plate on the cushion beside me. I could feel my heart pumping hard as I curled my fingers together and placed them to my lips in thought as I leaned over some. Even I was not ready for that press conference and it wasn't even about me. There was a knock on the door that made me mildly jump. I looked at the door curious. I wasn't going to see Viktor today because he was training for an upcoming fight. I quietly moved to the door and looked through the peep hole and my mouth dropped at who it was. I opened the door quickly and smiled happily. \"ALEX!\" I gushed and jumped into his arms. He laughed and embraced me. What was he doing here? He was in a grey tight t-shirt and blue jeans. \"Hey cuzzo.\" he replied and released me. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked opening the door wider for him to come in. He entered. \"Took some time off. Already saw mom first and Donnie and B, since I was in the states. Thought I'd come see how you were. It seems there's a lot going on.\" he replied. I shut the door and sighed, nodding. \"Yes. How is Adonis?\" I replied moving my plate of now cold eggs and we both sat down. His eyes were smooth and tired, like Ivan's. He nodded. \"He's heeling, still trying to find himself. And you, engaged and pregnant.\" he said. I rolled my eyes and leaned back into the warm cushion. \"And you hate me too?\" I asked. He gave a confusing frown. \"How could you ask that? I could never hate you… no one in this family hates you.\" he said. \"Adonis does.\" I replied sharply and he shook his head. \"He's just sad. He feels like he lost his title and sister all in the same day. He will bring himself out of it.\" he said. I sighed gently and placed my hand on my forehead as it was a prop between me and the couch. \"But I'm marrying the enemy.\" I replied. He scoffed. \"And that enemy's father is MY father. How do you think I feel?\" he asked. I winced never even considering how he felt. His father killed our father. That had to leave his world upside down. \"I'm sorry… how are you feeling?\" I asked and he leaned over some and shrugged. \"I was angry at Mom. I was confused and afraid until I realized my life was happy before Ivan Drago and it will still be happy after Ivan Drago.\" he said and I nodded. It was nice that he had overcome his feelings through all of this. \"I have seen Viktor Drago fight… that man was raised in hatred.\" I slowly looked up at him wondering where he was going with his statement but he smiled. \"And then he met you. His eyes may be sharp and dangerous, but now they are filled with hope.\" he said. I gave a smile of content at his words. \"Maybe this is what we need after 30 years of quiet and deep anger toward each other, maybe this is what's needed to end it all. Hell it all truly should have ended when you were born.\" I replied and he shrugged. \"Yeah but it was meant for you two to do it. No one would have met anyone had Adonis not have picked up boxing.\" he said and I looked down at my knees thinking of Adonis now. I was worried for him. Bianca and Aunt Alicia were worried for him. \"Maybe… I should go see him before I'm too far along that I can't travel.\" I replied. Alexander nodded. \"That sounds like the mature thing to do.\" he said. I snorted. \"Yeah because he wouldn't have done it.\" I replied. \"Now you know that's true.\" he said and began to stand up. I followed his actions. \"Gotta go?\" I asked. With him being a soldier, I never knew how much time I had with him when he visited, so I made every moment count when I could. He nodded. \"Yeah. There's one more person I need to see. Before I head back to Los Angeles.\" he said. I walked him to the door and smiled up at him. He gave a gentle smile before embracing me. \"I will see you soon.\" I nodded. \"Okay.\" I replied and closed the door behind him. I smiled even more, happy to have gotten to see my cousin. I grabbed my phone off the coffee table and called my aunt. \"Hey. Next week I will be flying to see you.\" I replied. Normal POV The press were hungry dogs trying to do or say anything to get inside Viktor's head. That's what his father told him. \" Next time you let me do all the talking.\" Ivan commanded as the two moved through the building where the conference had just ended. 'Like you'd even know what to say.' Viktor thought. If anyone was going to speak on his relationship with his fiancé it would be him. As they moved through the double doors, they made their way across the street and over to the parking lot. As they saw their truck, Ivan squinted some as he noticed a familiar face as he was propped onto his truck. Viktor saw him and frowned immediately. What the hell was he doing here? Ivan stopped a few feet away, and Viktor stopped behind him, his usual look of intimidation plastered on his face. Had Alexander been anyone else, he may have been afraid of the two men but he wasn't. \"How did you find us?\" Ivan asked coldly as if the man before him were a complete stranger. Alexander leaned off the truck. \"I'm an excellent tracker. It's what makes me the best in my division… they even created that division specifically for my skills. There is nowhere anyone can go that I will not find them.\" he said. Viktor's frown deepened a bit more as Alexander walked closer to the two making Viktor step closer to his father. But Ivan didn't look afraid as he stared his firstborn in the face. Viktor took in Alexander's face. Hard and chiseled like himself and his father. He was tall like them, but his eyes were brighter than Viktor's ever could be. Viktor wondered what it would have been like to grow up with this man. He'd have some type of outlet. Maybe he would have been the fighter raised on nothing but sweat and iron. Viktor finally looked down some feeling mildly defeated for not being an only child. Maybe he was upset that he was still in some way an only child. \"What are you doing here?\" he finally asked. Alexander just stared at Ivan getting to know the man with only his eyes. \"If you do anything to hurt my mom or my cousins, there will be nothing in this world that is strong enough to stop me from taking you down… not your government, not its police… not your son.\" he said, acid-laced into his tone. Finally, Alexander's eyes met Viktor's and the two stared at each other for a moment. Had he not been his finance's cousin, he would have beaten his ass into the ground. But if anything, Viktor respected him for his words for he wishes he could say that to his father. To threaten him to finally let him think for himself would have been a blessing. Alexander only turned and walked over to his car, not caring if either man said anything. His car is silver and shiny. Astrid's POV It was after midnight when Viktor came over smelling like he had just gotten out of the shower. As we lied in the bed together, he told me my cousin visited him. We were naked in the bed, staring across from each other, his hand moving to massage the side of my curls. \"I'm sorry he said that.\" I replied gently and he shook his head as if not bothered. \"He's a strong man… raised in a strong family. I respect him.\" he said. I smiled gently leaning into his hand some. \"I am planning to fly to L.A. next week to see my family.\" I informed. He looked mildly concerned. \"Should you be flying? Maybe we should call your doctor.\" he said and I grinned some. \"The baby isn't even formed yet. I'm not at risk of anything.\" I replied and he nodded and leaned in close to me. \"I come with you.\" he said. I was caught off guard by his statement. \"Are you sure? I mean I know you have to train and I don't want to cause problems between you and your father.\" I replied. He just shook his head. \"I want to do things with you without having to think about if my father approves,\" he said slowly crawling toward me before he was on top of me. \"I like making love to you…\" he leaned in and kissed me sweetly. \"And fucking you knowing full well he doesn't approve.\" The heat between us rose immediately. I needed him again, so I leaned up and kissed him violently.","LastChapter":"20 Within the week, Viktor had gone back to training preparing for upcoming fights.

The faunnwonders if she ever thinks of him, at least somewhat fondly. Of whatnsort of importance is he to her? Friend? Servant? Anything? Henwalks slowly over to a rock, and sits on it. He sighs longingly. I amnnothing to her, he thinks to himself. Tonher, I'm just the Faun, and nothing more.[Chapter 2] Moannanwatches from her window; she looks at the Faun walking into thenwoods. She turns away, thoughts streaming into her head. Henhas been so down lately , she thinks. Henno longer talks to me. He was my best friend. What happened? Shensits on her huge canopy bed with white silk covers, and as hard asnshe tries, Moanna cannot think of any reason why the Faun shouldnavoid her so. \"Inwonder if I've done something wrong...\" she murmurs to herself. nShe sighs and walks over to the mirror on her wall, and studiesnherself in it. Moanna almost gasps; how she has changed since shenfirst arrived here! Her hair was very long, past her waist, andntumbled from her head like a satin chocolate ribbon. Her face hadnlost its little-girl roundness. Her body is no longer thin as anrail, but shapely and voluptuous. She sighs. You'llnmarry in no time , her father had told hernrecently, beaming at his beautiful daughter. \"Indon't want to marry,\"nshe says to her reflection. Her lips move around the words withndefiance and elegance. She says it again, louder. \"I don'tnwant to marry. I don't want to marry.\" She grins, and turnsnaway from the mirror. Moanna walks to the window once again, andnwatches the forest. The leaves of the trees swirl around in thenbreeze like an angry ocean, and after some moments the Faun walksnout. Moannanturns away from the window. Her good mood is gone.[Chapter 3] He stands in the rain at nighttime; his matted hair falls in wet locks around him, and he stares up at the cloudy black sky, feeling as though the heavens are weeping with him. Saltwater tears mixed with rainwater are streaming down his cheeks from his aqua blue, slanted eyes, etching pain all over his face. The grass is wet and mushy underneath his cloven feet, and the wind is not comforting but painful, piercing his flesh like a thousand knives. The trees shake accusatory fingers at the crying sky, and the Faun shivers with cold, wet sadness. \"Faun? What are you doing out here?\" Her voice is as gentle and strong as the breeze, and he whirls around, startled. She stands there, her hair wet underneath the pattering tattoo of rain, her dress emerald green and almost soaked. The Faun wonders if she was standing there watching him, and for how long. He clears his throat to rid his voice of the tears that clogged it. \"Princess, you're going to be soaked...\" but he stops himself. She already is soaked. \"Go back inside before you catch your death,\" he adds. \"That's not important, dear Faun,\" she says softly. His heart flutters hopefully. She'd called him 'dear'? \"I need to speak with you.\" \"Princess, can it wait until the world is drier?\" the Faun asks her. He doesn't want her to see him like this; he wants her to speak with him when he is full of joy and goodness. He sighs inwardly. He never has joy or goodness anymore. \"No, this cannot wait,\" Moanna replies. \"For if I wait until tomorrow, you'll find some excuse to wait even longer. I cannot have that.\" She pauses. The Faun does not reply. Moanna goes on, \"We are friends, right? Best friends?\" What little hope that was in the Faun's heart fades away when she says this. \"Yes, of course, my Princess,\" he says instantly, trying to keep the sorrow from his wavering words. \"For as long as we both live, we're friends.\" Moanna studies him for a long moment, and then sighs in a resigned way. \"All right,\" she says. \"I suppose I am satisfied...for now.\" She walks back inside, and the Faun is left behind, confused and sad. His tears have stopped falling, but the rain still has not let up. He turns back to the sky, and wishes for the tears to fall again, so that he can know he is real. But they do not come. He simply gazes up into the sky, sorrowful and lost, rainwater falling into his uncrying eyes.[Chapter 4] The huge book creaks when Moanna opens it; the spine cracks in a tired but good-natured way. She is sitting cross-legged on her silk bed, her red dress flowing about her, as she clutches the book that the Faun gave her, holding it with eager hands. It is bright and warm outside the castle, and the sunlight pours into the room, its brightness bleeding pure joy. For a moment, Moanna looks up into the light, closing her eyes, bathing her face in warmth. After a few long moments, she looks down once again at the book resting in her lap. Ink words begin to form onto the old parchment. It slowly entwines itself, forming itself from meaningless lines to coherent words...\"The Faun is...\" she murmurs, reading the still-forming message. \"Princess Moanna,\" a voice calls from outside her door, muffled and faint, accompanied by a timid knock. \"Princess?\" \"Come in,\" Moanna calls, sighing and closing her book; she'll have to read later, she supposes. The door opens and reveals the Princess' personal servant girl, who looks nervous and fidgety. \"What is it, Ava?\" Moanna asks kindly. \"There is a man your father wants you to meet,\" Ava replies anxiously, her eyes darting around the room as if unsure of where to place themselves. \"Is this not an opportune time, Princess? Do you wish to meet that man later? It can be arranged, if you desire.\" Moanna looks at the ceiling, thinking. What sort of man does her father want her to meet? Her expression darkens. \"If it is a suitor ,\" she says angrily to no one in particular, \"I shall not be pleased at all ...\" Ava doesn't reply; she just looks down at her feet, unable to think of something to say. Moanna sighs moodily. \"I don't want to see anyone,\" she says. \"Tell Father to send him away.\" \"Yes, Princess,\" Ava says timidly, and scurries away. Distracted by her thoughts, Moanna thrusts her book back on the shelf. I'll read it later , she thinks, still enraged at the King's attempts to entice her to marry. She tells herself it won't work. She knows it won't work. Who wants marriage when you can have freedom? she thinks. A wife scrubs the dirt out of her life day by day until she withers from exhaustion, but a free woman can roam wherever she pleases and have no restrictions or limits. \"So much for my good mood!\" she bursts out in the silence. \"Curse my father, I don't want to get married!\" Outside Moanna's room, the Faun grins inwardly. He has been standing, concealed, behind a statue outside her room, and has heard everything. Hope rises in his heart, and he feels a faint surge of joy which he has not felt in a long, long time. He smiles a little, and walks silently away.[Chapter 5] He dreams.n He is asleep peacefully on a flat, mossy stone in the forest. Fairyndust and dew float in the air around him, and the moon creates beamsnfiltered through the tree leaves. A quiet blanket has been rollednover the kingdom, and the Faun's dreams are quite nice. In hisnsleeping vision, he is up in a tree with Princess Moanna. They arensitting side by side, not speaking, just soaking up the warmth of thenworld. The sun shines brightly, almost too brightly, on the forest,nand the light of day is highly contrasted and surreal. Dream-Moannansoftly takes the Faun's huge, gnarled hand, and feels its pulse. Shensmiles--a grin that melted the Faun's heart. Moanna takes the Faun'snother hand and places it on her wrist. Their heartbeats arencompletely in sync. The thumps beat audibly throughout the kingdom;nthe energy of their heartbeats sounds in every realm, every worldnthat exists. The breezenlightly rustles the leaves of the tree, and Moanna and the Faunnwithdraw their hands. The Dream-Princess looks deeply into thenFaun's eyes, and he realizes that she is not such a little girl. Hensees her soul, and it is ancient, just like his; ancient and wise andnbeautiful. Dream-Moannanfades away, and the dream ends. The Faun awakens with a light smilenon his lips.[Chapter 6] She wanders the palace grounds, her blue velvet dress trailing behind her. The sky is grey and rumbling the threat of a storm. The weather has been so moody lately; never settling on one form of mind. Moanna feels heavy and sticky; the humid air makes her dress stick to her body from perspiration. Beads of sweat roll down between her breasts, and dot her forehead, glistening. She wipes her brow with the back of her hand, and decides to go back inside. And then she hears a voice behind her: \"Are you Princess Moanna?\" The voice is low and young and attractive. She turns around slowly, and sees a man standing behind her. \"I may be,\" she says haughtily. \"Who wants to know?\" She stares at him defiantly, not liking how he had addressed her so boldly. He is a young man, but a few years older than herself. His hair is brown and playfully tousled, and his face is hard, chiseled, and good-looking. \"I come from a kingdom near this one,\" he replies. \"My mother is the queen.\" \"Why are you here?\" Moanna asks him, not rudely. She feels slightly lost and out of control when she looks at his slightly smirking face. He bows, grinning. \"Your father invited me, Princess,\" he says. \"I came a few days ago, but you did not wish to be disturbed...\" Moanna looks at the sky for a few moments. She feels a bit nauseous and lightheaded looking at this boy, and this feeling slightly frightens her. She does not know where to put her eyes, and when she looks back at him, her pulse skips a beat. Why am I feeling this way? she wonders to herself. This is no way to behave...Oh, Moanna, you're just getting bad vibes from him. Obviously, he's not to be trusted. But she doubts her own thoughts. It doesn't feel like bad vibes...if there are any vibes at all, they feel good. \"It's too hot to talk right now,\" she says to the young man. \"I'm going inside.\" She turns, and walks back into the castle, feeling a little shaky. She ignores the boy's crestfallen \"Goodbye,\" as she closes the huge door and takes off to her room.[Chapter 7] His mind plays the scene he had witnessed over and over again, and each time it plays, his anger grows deeper. How could she look at that...that foul, arrogant man that way? Can't she see he has no heart, no soul? Such a match was ridiculous, and it enraged the Faun down to the very roots of his being! He is back in the forest, deeper in it than he had been in a long time: so deep that the light of day is nowhere to be seen. The air in the heart of the woods is stuffy and thick, and combined with his fury, it makes the Faun feel like he is suffocating. Despite his fury, the Faun's rational mind tries to make him see sense. Her expression was not one of love, the voice says to him. It couldn't have been. They are completely incompatible. The Faun grunts in agreement; though he had never spoken to the young man, and doesn't even know his name, he knows that Moanna is not right for him. But still, his mind replays what he saw again and again. Scarcely able to control his pain, he lets out a loud, piercing cry; a wail of a wounded soul, a tortured heart. The Faun sinks low to the ground, his mind still trying to make sense of it; still trying to convince him that he is just imagining things. But in his heart he still strongly suspects the unthinkable: Moanna might love someone other than me . No sound presents itself in the dark, gloomy heart of the forest. He can make as much noise of anger and pain as he wants; no one will hear him and come to comfort him. The still trees and dead air do not help remove the hurt that throbs in his veins. A small pouch sits next to him, containing food and other small things he may need if he decides to stay here for a while. He draws a candle from the bag, and cups his hands over it. He whispers a magickal incantation, his voice hoarse with pain, and a small flame dances on the candle. Normally he would have smiled at the small magick he had performed. Not today. He digs a small hole in the moist dirt, and places the candle in it. Its light illuminates his face with a small orange glow. Tears run down his cheeks, but he makes no sound or movement. His fury is replaced with despair. \"Why should I live?\" he whispers to the candle. \"What if she does love him, my dear little flame?\" The candle does not answer. A sign does not come to assure him or discourage him. The fire merely dances, merry and joyful though in the midst of the Faun's throbbing pain.[Chapter 8] \"Younlook like an angel,\" the young man says kindly to Moanna as shenwalks over to him. He smiles. He is sitting by the pond outside,nbut stands when she comes near. You'dnnever know there had been the threat of a storm the day before; it isna bright day, and the sun makes the pond water sparkle cheerfully. nThe castle makes a huge shadow on the grounds, but somehow the brightnsky manages to make the shadow unnoticeable. The trees swayncontentedly in the massaging breeze. Leaves flutter like lovesick,ngiddy youths. Moannansighs inwardly. Normally she would have rolled her eyes at hisnstupid, cliché comment, but for some reason, coming from himnit doesn't bother her. She simply smiles back, a faraway smile thatnreveals her troubled thoughts. The princennotices. \"Is there something wrong, Princess?\" he asksnher. She shakesnher head. \"No,\" she says firmly. She smoothes out hernpurple silk dress, and takes a deep breath, thinking about how tonform the question she wants to ask the man. \"Why are you herenin this kingdom?\" she says finally. \"Becausenit's beautiful here,\" he replies, grinning. The breeze touslesnhis hair a little, making him seem cool and carefree. \"And I'mnnot just talking about the scenery,\" he adds, winking at her. Moannandoesn't know what to do. She just wishes he'd go away, so that shenwouldn't have to wrestle with the feelings she might come to have. nAn unexpected anger rises in her chest. What right does this boy have to just come along and wreck her world? She bristles, and henlooks taken aback by her expression. \"HavenI done something to offend you?\" he asks her with genuinenapology. \"If I have, I beg you to forgive--\" \"Stopnthat,\" she says angrily. \"I don't need that.\" Shengives a huff of frustration, and wonders, Whynam I acting like this? Moanna, stop losing your temper! \"I'mnsorry,\" she says to the man. \"I just...have a lot on mynmind right now.\" \"Ofncourse,\" he replies, too warmly, too understanding. \"Justntell me what you need, and I will be happy to oblige.\" That'snwhat I'm afraid of, Moanna thinks. \"Inneed to...to go and...think about things.\" \"Ofncourse,\" he repeats, smiling. Moannanflees, and the young man hears a voice behind him, an old, tired,nhurt voice with dust and age in every syllable. \"Who...are...you?\" The youngnman turns, and sees a Faun--oh, he had never seen a Faun before! n\"How do you do!\" he says eagerly, wringing his hands. The Faunnrolls his slanted eyes. This boy is worse than he thought. Sonridiculous! It makes the Faun even more confused as to why Moannanmight love him. What one earth does she possibly see in him? ThenFaun clears his throat, and asks, \"Where do you come from?\"n He cannot help the small irritated growl in his words. A smilenfrom the young man; he gestures to the mountains. \"Straightnover those, and a couple hours North. Let me tell you, it took angood deal of trouble getting here, what with your forest beingnso... infested! \" nThe boy laughs good-naturedly. \"Infested?\"nthe Faun questions, somewhat offended. \"Infested with what ,npray?\" \"Oh...younknow...fairies and sprites and such things,\" this man repliesncasually. \"Although I have to admit, the nymphs are quitennice...they gave me some food and told me which way to go.\" The Faunnalmost chokes on his laughter. This idiot! Doesn't he know never to accept anything from nymphs? Their food probably put somenconfusion hex on him, and then they probably gave him the wrongndirections. Yet another reason to be baffled by Moanna's possiblenlove for the man! The Faun works hard to keep his face fromncontorting to jeering laughter. \"I see,\" he repliesncalmly. \"Arenyou really a Faun?\" the boy asks eagerly. \"Yes.\"n The Faun can hardly bring himself to say more words to this idiot. \"Ah...well,nI'm only asking because I've never met one before...\" \"Wenare few,\" the Faun says bluntly, and then changes the subject. n\"Are you here to court Princess Moanna? I can think of no othernreason besides that.\" The boynlooks a bit uncomfortable, but says finally, \"Well...I like her, if that's what you--\" \"You like her,\" ThenFaun says incredulously. \"Do you have no depth to your soul? nAre you incapable of having a spirit at all ?n Don't you know what love is?\" The Faun is almost shouting atnthis boy, and doesn't bother to apologize afterward. \"If that'snall, if you just like her, let me tell you that you're never going to get her.\" The Faunntrots angrily away before he does real damage. His fury at thisnyoung man is too great to handle right now. \"To think!\" hensays aloud. \"To think that such an imbecile could ever marrynMoanna!\" He laughsnsarcastically, but he knows it isn't funny: it's a serious, seriousnproblem that could cause him more pain than he can now imagine.[Chapter 9] \"Tell my father that I want the boy to leave,\" Moanna says to her servant girl, who says, \"Yes, Princess,\" and scuttles away. Moanna rolls on her back and sighs. She is lying on her silk bed, staring at the folds of white canopy above it. She doesn't want to face these feelings she ought not to have. Feelings for someone she doesn't want; that might someday lead her to marriage. Ha! Marriage! She jeers at the word. Me, married? It seems ridiculous to her. A week ago, she could not care less for men or love. But now...now she isn't so sure. Which is why she has to make the young man go away. \"If he's gone, then there's no love to feel,\" she tells herself, and nods in agreement. This makes sense. But still, something troubles her, but she can't figure out what. \"It's that Faun ,\" she whispers to herself finally. \"Something odd is going on with him...if only he'd speak long enough for me to figure out what.\" She thinks for a moment. \"Where does he live?\" she asks herself. \"Not in the castle...he doesn't strike me as a castle-dwelling type...\" \"Pardon me, Princess, but the King has told me to send word to you that the young man will be on his way to his kingdom tomorrow evening.\" Ava has returned, and is now standing in Moanna's doorway, looking uncomfortable. She adds timidly, \"And, Princess, you were wondering where the Faun lives?\" She points to the window, and Moanna rises and walks over to it. \"He lives in the forest...some say at the very heart; the darkest and thickest, but those could just be rumors, ma'am.\" Moanna turns to face Ava, and gives her a warm smile. \"Thank you very much,\" she says. \"For I very much wish to find him.\" Ava bows and leaves. I'm going into that forest , Moanna thinks, and grabs her cloak.[Chapter 10] A tremor of magickal power moves through the mossy, moist floor of the forest. Only the Faun senses it, and he wakes up from his light slumber. He's been in the heart of the forest for a day now, venting his anger and thinking things through. Last night he vowed never to exit the woods again, but now he isn't so sure he wants to hold to this oath. After all, isn't there a chance that she might not love the young man? The Faun doubts it, but still... This strange surge of power in the forest frightens him; he wonders what it means. After it happens, it is gone instantly, which upsets him even more. How is he to magickally identify it if it's gone? Not at ease, he gingerly lies back down on his flat rock, and tries to go back to sleep. Another tremor. This time he leaps up, knowing exactly what it is. The forest has an intruder-sensory magick; it can tell when someone unknown is entering; someone who does not belong to the woods. The Faun wonders who it might be. The King? A dark spirit? If so, he has to be prepared. The Faun takes out the candle from his bag, lights it, and whispers some magickal incantations into the thick, humid air. He waits. For whoever--or whatever--is coming, he waits, the moist dew dripping off the dark leaves of the tall trees that black out the sun. He waits.[Chapter 11] The leaves of the trees and bushes scrape Moanna's cloak and skin, as if telling her to keep away. She fights, pushing them back from whence they came. Moanna clutches a small knife, to help her fight off any stubborn wood-creatures she might meet. If I meet a spirit, though, a knife won't do me much good , she thinks to herself, pushing away a walloping branch. She travels deeper and deeper into the forest, grunting and groaning with the effort of making it through the trees. It's almost as if the forest is condensing itself so as to make it harder for her to get through... As she slowly but surely pushes on, Princess Moanna notices the air growing hotter, thicker, and wetter. She feels as if she is in some dense jungle, water trapped in the air, with no breeze to speak of. Even more strangely, the forest itself seems to be alive . It throbs with a pulse; a heartbeat; a soul. Moanna is amazed by the sort of plants it harbors; tall, tall trees that are so thick you can't see the light of day through them; small plants that seem to fly and swirl through the air; wet exotic fruits dripping with dew and sweetness. The Princess can hardly concentrate on both getting through the brush and staring at the plant life. A magickal dust floats in the air; could it be pixie traces, or nymph spells? As she trudges on, the floor of the woods gets wetter and thicker; she has to pull on her leg to get her foot out of the ground with each step, and it makes a thick sucking sound when she does. It seems to be many, many hours before she finally reaches the heart of the forest, and the first things she sees is the Faun bent over a candle, muttering something magickal.[Chapter 12] He knows it is her. He senses her coming, and knows who it is. Gods, why doesn't she stay away? Doesn't she know she's tearing me apart? The trees suddenly creak and moan, as though disturbed from an ancient sleep. The Faun's slanted eyes scan the forest around him, seeing nothing in the darkness. The candle wax is melting quickly, and the flame weakens. And, with a rustle of leaves on the forest floor, Moanna appears behind him. The Faun whirls around, and, seeing her in a traveler's cloak with a knife in one hand and her spirit bleeding strength, his breath catches, and his pulse quickens. He tries to think of something to say to her, but language has escaped him completely. He simply stares at her, unsure how he is supposed to feel. \"You once told me that you had names only the wind and the trees can pronounce,\" she says strongly, looking him straight in the eyes. She doesn't wait for him to confirm this memory. \"I have a name for you too, Faun. Your name is Friend; for you are my friend forever...or at least, that's what I thought.\" \"Princess,\" the Faun suddenly manages to gasp. \"I don't--\" \"You have vanished as of late like an underground beast flees from light,\" she interrupts. \"We used to talk, sing, and waste the hours. I do not know what happened between us,\" she says, not breaking her gaze; simply holding it. \"But whatever it was, I wish that it hadn't happened.\" \"What are you saying?\" the Faun asks hoarsely. \"I'm saying I want you back at the castle. I want you to be my friend once again.\" She offers him a thin smile. She seems to be radiating power, and the Faun has to look away from her strong gaze. He looks at his hands instead. \"Friends...\" he whispers. He mourns the word. \"Is that...is that all, Princess?\" he asks, desperation in his voice and on his face. Moanna says nothing. She simply looks into his eyes, which have turned away from her. And she sees . She knows what has been troubling him so. She knows of his pain, his sorrow. Moanna understands that the Faun is in love with her. \"Never mind,\" the Faun says quickly. \"You don't need to answer that, Princess. I am sorry. A true friend would not ask such a thing.\" He sighs, wiping the sweat off his face with the back of his rutted hand. \"Very well,\" he tells her, attempting a smile. \"I shall accompany you back to the castle.\"[Chapter 13] Friend . The word the Faun lives by for the next few months. Friend . Moanna does not speak to him or his love for her, and he does not bring it up, either. Friend . A word that haunts him, eats away at his ancient soul. A word which causes a swell of despair inside him every time he hears it from the Princess' lips. He pushes away his pain, and focuses on being Moanna's friend . If she says, \"I'm so glad we're friends, Faun,\" he would answer, \"As am I, Princess.\" If he says \"good morning\" to her, what he means is \"please, please love me.\" It is midnight, and he is staying in the castle. He sleeps now in the Plant Room, which reminds him of his forest home. A pond rests on the floor of the room, and he gazes at his reflection. The long, curling black horns; his slanted blue eyes; his ancient skin; the swirls in his forehead. He is an image which haunts him, because he is an image that Moanna does not love. At least, not in the way he wishes. A friend way. His gnarled hand touches his grey-skinned cheek. He lightly strokes his own skin, to comfort himself. The touch does some good; it takes his mind off his suffering, if only for a moment. The moon shines through a window, illuminating the plants and the pond in the room. Moonbeams touch down on the Faun's skin, as if trying to soothe him. He smiles gratefully at the sky. \"Thank you, dear Moon,\" he whispers. \"I take what small comforts I can; though they may not last forever, I thank you for shining every night and distracting me from my pain.\" He gazes at the sky through the window for a few moments, and looks back to his reflection. He is calmer. His face doesn't haunt him so much now.[Chapter 14] The sunlight illuminates Moanna's chocolate brown hair, and she squints as she gazes up into it. The grass hugs her bare ankles with cool, soft blades, and her blue skirt gently sways in the breeze. It is dusk; the hour of bliss; the time of day when everyone forgets who they are and live only in the moment they are in. Moanna smiles, and sits under the shade of a tree. She sees the Faun from afar; he is on the other side of the pond, looking at ancient rune scrolls, his brow furrowed in concentration. A wave of affection goes over the Princess, and she grins. My Faun is so serious , she thinks happily. She looks at him for long moments, studying him like a philosopher. His black, swirling horns gleam in the sunlight; his eyes are almost closed in examination of the scrolls; his wild hair tosses and whirls about in the wind. He's not self-conscious , she notices. He's never cared about the way he looks, or the way others look. He only sees a person, and a person's soul. She greatly admires this, and after a long moment, she shifts her gaze back to the sky, her head full of thought. The rush of warmth that she felt when she looked at the Faun does not go away. It stays, and she wonders why it stays, and wonders how long it will stay. Subconsciously, the Princess examines this sensation, and can come to no conclusion besides the fact that she might feel something a little more than friend-love for the Faun. No, she thinks to herself, shaking her head. That's impossible. She pushes the warm affection away, and walks back into the castle, feeling lightheaded.[Chapter 15] In the pitch-black night, Moanna wakes up screaming. Her shriek echoes into the night, and is followed by dead silence; frighteningly still silence. She is sweating, her body beaded with perspiration. Moanna swallows hard and gets out of bed, staring outside at the star-spotted sky. Must've had a nightmare, she thinks. Although I can't remember what it is... She hears the creak of her door opening. Footsteps sounding like cloven hooves drum the floor, and the Faun lights a torch to see what's happened. Moanna looks at him, and he seems frightened and wild, with the look of having just woken up. \"What's going on?\" the Faun asks her, fear in his voice. \"I heard a scream...\" Moanna sits back down on her bed, suddenly overwhelmed by a headache. \"I don't know,\" she answers. \"I think I...must've had a bad dream...\" Her voice trails off as her attention wanders to the Faun. She finds herself staring at him, and looks away quickly, turning red. The Faun feels relieved; he'd thought that someone had tried to break in and take her, or some such absurd thing. He finds that his gaze is lost in the back of Moanna's head; her long, dark hair in coiled tendrils. But he remembers sorrowfully that he is an unloved, hideous creature, and looks at the floor instead. A small, weak sound is coming from Moanna, and the Faun realizes that she is crying. He timidly walks over to her, not knowing what to do. Look at me, Moanna thinks. What am I crying for? It was just a dream... The Faun sits down next to her on her bed, and puts his arms around her in an embrace of comfort. She turns and sobs openly on his shoulder, crying away all the feelings that she does not know what to do with. The Faun simply lets her weep, loving himself for comforting her and hating himself for not being loved by her. The stars gleam, and the night wears on, and once Moanna has cried herself to sleep, the Faun quietly covers her with a silk blanket and slips out of her room.[Chapter 16] The Faun. An ancient, mysterious creature, as old as the faces of the mountain, carved by time. Moanna, the Princess. A girl who is almost a woman; royalty. She should not be harboring these feelings. Every time she even thinks of the Faun, she feels a blush rising into her cheeks, and she fixes her embarrassed eyes on her hands, or the floor. I do not love him, she thinks as she walks along the edges of the pond. She kicks a stone into the water, and ripples gently fan out on the surface. Even if I did, it is impossible. My father would never allow such a pairing. Never. She looks up to the sky, and the breeze embraces her skin coolly. The bright blueness of above almost blinds her with its brilliance, and she looks down at the grass nudging her feet. But am I not allowed to imagine what I wish could be? she wonders to herself, grinning. My father hasn't got access to my thoughts, has he? So she pictures the Faun; she pictures his reflection in the water, the ripples contorting his dusty body. She imagines his horns, gleaming in the sunlight, his slanted blue eyes fixed calmly on the water. In her mind, the wind blows gently around him. The mere sight of the Faun in her mind's eye satisfies her, and she closes her eyes and lets the image linger. Her eyes shut, she thinks, If I love him...so what? What's the big commotion about it? She thinks of the prince who'd come a few months earlier, and grimaces. Well, she thinks, opening her eyes, at least the Faun has got a brain. Looking up at the sky, she smiles to herself, taking joy in the images no one else can see; images of the Faun.[Chapter 17] His spine tingles as he feels her watching him. The breeze blows gently on the Faun's back as he sits underneath a tree, and he senses the Princess' eyes on him. He shivers with glee, not even bothering to remind himself that she doesn't love him. All he cares about right now is the attention she is unknowingly giving him. Clouds slowly form on the horizon, and spread out unto the sky. I sense rain , he thinks, lifting his face to the air and sniffing lightly. The wind warns of a storm. He remembers that night; the rain pounding on his back, his head. He thinks of Moanna's questioning gaze: We are friends, right? Best friends? This memory's smell is faintly on the breeze. He pushes it away and lingers on the feeling of her eyes on him. \"Faun?\" Her voice rings out in the silent coming of the rain, and the Faun turns. She is standing at the edge of the pond, looking at him. \"Yes, my Princess?\" Moanna's eyes burn right through him like fire; his soul bears itself to her willing gaze. He has been turned inside out. He cannot say no to her. The rain comes, as expected, and still the Princess says nothing. Her hair swirls around her in a sudden wind, and she looks like a warrior maiden, standing up to her enemies, unafraid of death. Her eyes do not turn away; they take in every inch of the Faun and his soul. Her expression remains solid. She still does not speak. How much of this can I take, Princess? he thinks. How long until I can have you? \"Yes, Princess?\" he asks again, gently. Raindrops patter violently on the earth, and Moanna turns away. \"Nothing,\" she murmurs, and walks towards the castle, rain elegantly bouncing off her form, as if she is surrounded by a dim, grey light. The Faun watches her go, and then looks down at his hands. He feels empty, now that she's gone. Now that her gaze is gone. --- A note: I will not be able to update from Sept 13 - Sept 21 or so, because I'll be camping. I may update a few times before I leave, but I'm just giving you all a warning. Do svidanja. Leiowyn[Chapter 18] She stands in front of her mirror again as it storms outside. Moanna paws at her long hair mindlessly, thinking of what had happened. She's said nothing to the Faun. It had rained. She knows he'd remembered that night too; the night she'd asked him if they were still friends. As she stares at her image in the mirror, she feels different, somehow. Her reflection isn't the same reflection it was a few months ago. Well--it's still her, yes, it still looks like her: long, long hair, pale skin, high cheekbones. But something has changed. I'm someone who can love now, she thinks to herself, smiling. I thought I couldn't love, before. I didn't want to get married. Now, I wouldn't mind so much... A huge crack of thunder and strike of lightning shakes the castle lightly. Moanna turns away from her mirror, and walks over to her window, her eyes searching for the Faun. He scans the edge of the forest, the pond, the hills. She can't see him. He must have come in , she thinks logically. She lets her mind wander. Do I love him? I didn't think so, but now I'm not so sure... She tried to imagine a life with the Faun. She pictured living with him in a stone house in the forest, curled up by a fireplace. She doesn't want a palace life. She wants a forest life, a life with the Faun. Yes, she thinks, closing her eyes. She thinks, I have changed...I can love now. I can love the Faun, and I can live in the woods. I can do it all . Smiling, she falls asleep on the windowsill, the rain falling gently on her face as the storm wears away.[Chapter 19] Sparks shoot from the stick as the Faun murmurs incantations, sweat beading his forehead. After a few tries, the stick bursts into flame, and the Faun leans back and smiles. He has not been in the forest for a long time; he's been too busy being with Moanna. But now he needs a little privacy, a little time to think. The outer rings of the forest are peaceful, unlike the bustling noise of the palace. The Faun faintly wonders whether he should bring the Princess into the woods one day. Such a chance will never come , he reminds himself. She is a Princess. She is the king's daughter. She'll get married, and I'll never see her again . But a small, small part of him is filled with doubt. He remembers her eyes on his back, her strong, non-blushing gaze when he looked back at her. He thinks of her figure, tall and proud, on the side of the pond. The Faun can see her as a queen, oh yes. But not a normal queen...a queen of strength, of power. Of goodness. The Faun sighs, and his burning stick goes out. Cursing, he mutters spells again, and it half-heartedly catches fire. He can also see her as a woman of the wood; a forest-woman. A tree-climber, a night-dweller. Someone to count stars with, to talk endlessly with, to stare at the mountains with. I can teach her the language of the wind and trees, he thinks to himself, and shudders. Thinking of such a future makes a shiver run down his spine. It won't happen , he thinks, but his grin shows that he thinks it might. After all, she had been watching him... His fire fades out again, and, grinning, he doesn't care.[Chapter 20] At midnight, the Faun is visited in the forest by one of his faeries. The trees whisper an arrival, and the Faun turns to see his faerie hovering midair, a silhouette in the barely-seen moon. \"Yes, my friend?\" the Faun says, with a small sad smile. You must tell her, the Faun's faerie whispers in his ear, in the tongue of faeries. Before it is too late, and the King has her marry another. Its grim expression is serious, and the Faun sighs. \"I know,\" he replies, his voice hoarse and tired. \"I just...don't...want her to hate me.\" The words bring tears to his eyes, and the faerie gives an exasperated huff. Are you any better off like this; mourning lost love and wallowing in self-pity? the faerie asks him. Please, my friend. It is not wise to not take risks only because you are afraid to do so. Hiding does not solve anything. Friend, look at me. The faerie zooms closer to the Faun, glaring at him. \"I didn't give up hope,\" the Faun says to his friend. \"She has been watching me lately...\" Then why will you not tell her how you feel? the faerie demands. A long silence hovers in the forest as the Faun thinks this over. \"Very well,\" he says finally, and lets out a shuddering sigh. \"You bring her here. I cannot go inside the castle again. It is...not my habitat.\" The faerie nods. I understand, it says. I will bring her to you.[Chapter 21] The book's spine creaks as Moanna opens it; she is sitting cross-legged on her bed in the middle of the night, unable to sleep. The book is soft and familiar in her hands, and she is sure no one will interrupt her while she looks through it this time. Slants of moonlight fall into her room, giving her just enough light for her to not have to get a candle. She turns a few pages for no reason she can think of, and stares at a page of old parchment, waiting for something to appear. Lines of ink crawl on the paper, and form into words. \" The Faun...\" Her heart quickens, and she gulps as the words make themselves known. \"The Faun is...\" \"He is what, he is what?\" she asks aloud, impatient. The ink lines slow down, and then stop all together, until the page simply reads, \"The Faun is\". Moanna slams the book shut, and then winces. Such uselessness! she thinks angrily. I thought the Book of Crossroads would help me with such a difficult situation as this. She sighs, and gets up to put the book on the shelf. Before she can, a buzzing sound comes next to her ear. She whirls around, and sees one of the Faun's faerie pets. \"Hello,\" she says. \"I don't suppose you'd know how to make this book work, would you?\" The faerie gives her a grin which she reads as: I haven't a clue. \"How useless,\" she says under her breath, and then adds quickly, \"I'm sorry! I didn't mean any disrespect...I'm just angry, that's all.\" The faerie gives her another devilish grin, its wings buzzing like a bee's, a gleam in its glittering black eyes. It flies closer to her and lands on her shoulder, tugging at her ear. \"What?\" Moanna says wearily. \"Please, it's too late for games. I'm tired.\" The faerie tugs harder on her earlobe, making her grimace. \"All right! Take me to wherever you want,\" she says. Then, all at once, Moanna understands. \"You're taking me to the Faun, aren't you?\" The tugs on her ear cease, and the faerie nods, still grinning. It whizzes quickly out the door, and, sighing, Moanna follows.[Chapter 22] The trees shiver tensely as Moanna, clutching her cloak, steps inside. The harsh wind seems to push her in, as though the whole world is aware of her meeting with the Faun. The faerie whizzes nervously in front of her, hoping that the Faun will not flee. This is too important. No, the faerie thinks to itself. The Faun is weak and strong at the same time. He is weak without Moanna, but strong with her. Moanna's feet crush autumn leaves as she follows the faerie into the woods. The path winds and weaves around the trees, and hours slowly slither by. The faerie grows anxious; has the Faun gone deeper into the woods? Will they have a hard time finding him? The small creature turns around in midair to face Moanna. It gives her a look that means, Be aware of the forest. We may have to look for the Faun. Nodding and shivering slightly, Moanna walks along behind the faerie, her eyes grazing the woods, hungry for any sight of the ancient being.[Chapter 23] A rushing, humming sound is in his ears as he is aware that she arrives. The forest floor seems to pound with his heart; a natural drum beat played by the trees. No wind seems to be present but he feels it howling in his ears. An ongoing battle rages with in him; Shall I flee? No, yes, no. The internal noise clashes with the forest's silence, creating a tornado of chaos swirling in the Faun's mind. He becomes lightheaded and dizzy, and unsure of where to put his eyes. He rests them on a tree root beneath his feet. The world seems to sway as he feels her coming closer. He notices with painful accuracy the footsteps of the one he loves; the rustle of the leaves as the Princess crushes them with her foot. He hears the swish of her cloak as she turns about, seeking him. To reveal myself, or not? The faerie's whizzing wings sound through the air, and the throbbing of the Faun's veins pounds louder and louder, until he thinks, Enough! , gulps, and throws himself into Moanna's path.[Chapter 24] The forest is still, and the faerie whizzes away, knowing to give them privacy. Moanna is panting slightly, her cheeks a little flushed. The Faun's eyes switch back and forth from the Princess' chin to his feet to the forest ceiling. Not a word is spoken for long moments; all that is heard is the hush of the trees and their leaves falling gracefully onto the dirt floor. A sigh slowly flows out between Moanna's slightly parted lips, and she is the first to speak. \"My friend,\" she says, her voice slightly wavering, \"my friend who is not a friend, who should be a friend, but who wishes to be more than a friend.\" The Faun does not look startled. \"Oh yes,\" says Moanna. \"I know of your feelings. I know the emotions that creep up inside you. Though you have tried to banish them, they keep returning.\" She looks up at the leaves above her, then straight into the Faun eyes. \"You have been hurt unnecessarily,\" she tells him flatly. \"You needn't have worried, all this time.\" Her voice trails off faintly. The Faun clears his throat, which feels raw and coated with crust and age. \"My Princess, I am not sure I understand what you are saying.\" He finds it difficult to look into her eyes, so his fixes his gaze on his hands. \"But whatever it is,\" he mumbles, \"please say it, for I am unsure I can bear much more torment.\" \"This is what I say to you, Faun,\" Moanna tells him, raising her head high. \"I say that if you must relieve yourself of the burdens you carry, then do so now, or never speak to me again.\" She stops, startled at her own words. But it is the only way, she thinks to herself gravely. He must learn to face his fears. A small sigh escapes from the Faun's mouth, and he gives up. \"Very well,\" he replies hoarsely, and then shudders. \"I love you,\" he says.[Chapter 25] The windnhowls approval of the Faun's confession. He feels lightheaded andndizzy; almost as though he's about to fall over. Moanna's imagenmultiplies for a moment as he awaits her answer, his vision blurring. Thenstrong, beautiful, intelligent, wise Princess Moanna exhales a shortnbreath of relief. She smiles lightly, and walks over to the Faun. nShe stands in front of him for a few moments, bends over, and kissesnhim lightly. They bothnsway for a moment in their embrace, and then break apart. Moannansighs. \"I know you do,\" she tells him. \"I justnwanted to make sure you knew it, too.\"[Chapter 26] She stands by my side. Years have passed, and she ages. I grow older than is even possible. Her hair harbors a few grey streaks, and the lines on her face grow a bit deeper. But Moanna is still beautiful to me. This will never change.

Sadie'snPOV \"Wellnlookie here it's nerdy Sadie Gilliam.\" I groaned hearingnone of the many people whom I hated, I knew the voice from anywhere.nIt was Jan. \"Wellnaren't you going to say anything to me or act like quiet mute thatnyou are?\" Indidn't' say anything at all, I brushed my hair out of my eyes andnwalked down the hall as quickly as I could still hearing the laughterncome from Jan, I had know him since elementary school and in all mynyears of knowing me he has never said a nice word to me, not once. Inhadn't done anything to him, at least not that I know. He justndecided that I was going to be the girl he picked on, ridiculed,npoked fun at, and teased for the rest of his life. Inwasn't exactly the beautiful, drop dead, stunning girls he usuallynwent for but I always felt like that I was beautiful on the insidenand that's all I needed to know, I didn't need fancy clothes, anboyfriend, or makeup to make me feel happy even though my life wasnfar from the fairy tale life that I had once dreamed about havingnwhen I was little. Tonanyone else, I was your average eighteen year old girl with brownnhair, blue eyes, and freckles. I wore thin rimmed black glasses and Inwas extremely shy and kept to myself which is why I was made fun ofnso much. I was the nerdiest girl at school. If you could label, Inwould be the nerd. Itnwas the beginning of my senior year of high school and I was ready tonbe done with it and leave, I was planning on getting far away fromnCalifornia as far as I could, far away from all the drama, the tears,nthe fights, the fake people, and mostly importantly Jan.[Chapter 2] Author'snNote: Here is the next one and this comes from Jan's and Sadie'snPOV and gives you more back story to Sadie. Enjoy! Read and review! Bluehaven4220:nThanks! I didn't want to make her a mary-sue and that will play anmajor role in the story especially later. Glad you like! Jan'snPOV \"Whatna nerd.\" I shook my head as I watched meek and shy SadienGilliam rush down the hallway looking at the ground as she usuallyndid, she was the nerdiest girl in the entire school. I had never metnsomeone like her, she was quiet and meek and never said anything whennshe was spoken to, easy target for me. I had known her sincenelementary school and made fun of her ever since the day we met, shenhad glasses, freckles, and read more than anyone I knew. I hoped Indidn't have any classes with her this year, that would be a killer. \"Whatnare you doing talking to nerdy Sadie?\" I snorted. \"Morenlike making fun of her.\" I smiled as my best friend CarternPhelps looked at me while he messed with his shirt and said,\" Nownthat's more like it.\" \"She's such a nerd, who in thenhell would ever want to be with her?\" \"No, she'll benlonely for the rest of her life.\" Sadie'snPOV \"Whyncan't anyone be nice and help me out once in awhile?\" Inwas picking up my papers on the floor near my locker after someonenpurposely ran into me, probably one of Jan's friends who had passednhim in the hallway. \"Peoplenare jerks.\" I stood up to face the person who was helpingnand realized she was new to the school, she had jet black hair whichnwas pulled into a pony tail and she was chewing gum or something Incould tell. She was wearing jeans and a black t-shirt with writingnscrawled all over it. It was in cursive and I couldn't read what itnsaid. Insmiled. \"Thanks. I haven't seen you before, did you just movenhere?\" She smiled. \"I'm missy and I did just move here,nI saw those guys push you into the lockers but I got around to latento telling them off.\" I smiled. \"Thanks but I'm used tonit.\" \"You shouldn't be. By the way, what's yournname?\" I blushed. \"I'm sorry, I'm Sadie Gilliam and Inam used to it, it's happened to be my entire life. I'm the nerdnso everyone makes fun of me but mostly Jan.\" \"Is that angirl?\" I giggled. \"No he's a guy, he's a jerk. Well,nat least I think he is.\" Missy smiled at me and said,\"nWell, I have to get going but I'm sure I'll see you around andnkeep your head up. Don't let those jerks get to you.\" \"Inwon't. Thanks Missy.\" \"Hi Sadie.\" I turnednaround to see Les, a guy who I called my only close friend and alwaysnstuck up for me walking over to me and I said,\" Hi Les.\" \"Younaren't having a very good first day are you?\" \"Nope, Inran into to Jan or well he ran into me.\" \"Don't worrynabout him Sadie, just think in one year you'll be in New York Cityngoing to school at NYU.\" \"Inhope I get in Les.\" He smiled at me as we walked down thenhallway and he reassured me,\" You will get in, I promise you. NYUnwould love to have you.\" \"I hope your right.\" \"Younknow you will, don't worry about Jan and his friends. They are toonstupid to see how brilliant and beautiful you are.\" \"ThanksnJan.\" I hope Les was right, NYU was my dream school and Inwanted so badly to get in there, I was working two jobs and trying tonhelp out at home which wasn't easy, my dad left our family when Inwas young and I have two younger siblings and my mom who isn't muchnhelp either, she's an alcoholic who will sometimes leave the housenfor days and then suddenly appear days later like everything is okaynso I was basically the mother, I worked to help my siblings out andnso they could have things, she wasn't much help at all. Not manynpeople knew that about me, only a few. Les is one of them and hisnparents help me out whenever I need it but I want to learn things andnI want to show the world and mostly my parents and everyone I went tonhigh school with that I can do it. I'm not just the nerdy girl whonpays attention in class and gets high grades but that I canncontribute to society and accomplish my dreams.[Chapter 3] Sadie'snPOV AsnI entered my senior year English class for the last time, I noticednthat Jan was sitting in the back and I groaned inwardly and thought,\"nWhy this year?\" He must have been thinking because he rollednhis eyes in my direction and I made my way to the back as I usuallyndo and plopped down in my seat, I set my bag down as Jan looked at menand said,\" I bet you have already every single book we are supposednto read Sadie.\" A few laughed but I looked at him and said,\"nShut up Jan.\" \"Ohhh the mute speaks?!\" That'snwhen Missy walked in and yelled,\" Shut up asshole and leave hernalone!\" Jan looked at Missy and scoffed,\" Who the hell arenyou?\" \"Her friend that's who I am and I don't likenseeing my friends picked on.\" \"Like Sadie has anynfriends.\" Thatngot everyone expect Missy laughing who walked over and pushed Jannback into the chair and said,\" Shut up asshole or I'll make yournlife a living hell.\" \"Alright!!! That's enough!\" ThenEnglish teacher walked in and he said,\" That's enough, all ofnyou.\" I sighed as Jan snorted and sat down across the roomnand Mr. Sanders, our English teacher spoke up,\" Welcome to yournsenior English class, this is the beginning of the your last year atnhigh school.\" \"Well isn't he captain obvious?\" Someonenmuttered from the back of the room. \"Inam going to pretend I didn't hear that.\" \"Asnof now, you will be assigned a year long project which is due on thenlast day of your senior year. You will still have other homework butnthis will a partner project that you will do together and when I sayntogether, I mean it. Every two months, I will do checks up to seenwhere you are and see how much you have done.\" Everyonengroaned as he continued, I will be assigning you partners beginningnnow.\" \"Sadie Gilliam and Jan Robertson.\" \"Ohnno.\" Henmust have been thinking the same thing because his face lost colornand he sank into seat staring at the floor, I bit my lip as Missynshot a sympathic look in my direction and she mouthed,\" I'mnsorry.\" I shrugged as he finished calling the names andnannounced our project which was going to be based on an author and wenhad to do research but it was more of research project than a regularnessay, we had to find everything and put it into a ten page papernwith facts, stories, and everything you could think of and I had anfeeling that I would be doing most of the work. Jan'snPOV \"Younhave to be shitting me. I get stuck with the nerd out of all of thenpeople in this class.\" I glanced at Sadie who was lookingndown at the paper that he handed out to us and she already lookednengrossed in it, this was going to suck but then again I wouldn'tnhave to do much of the work because I knew she was going to do it. Butnhow in the hell did this happen? I couldn't be seen with her, shenwas a nerd. A laughing stock of the entire school, no one liked hernexpect for that stupid dyke sitting in the front. No one tells menoff, I hoped I wouldn't run into Missy or whoever the hell she was. Incouldn't even believe she was my partner, things couldn't getnworse than this. Or they might. \"Tomorrownyou will get with your partners and plan who is going to donwhat.\" Great,nnow I had to actually talk to her and get to know her and knew thatnwe were probably going to have to work together not during schoolnhours. Just what I needed. Inwas hoping things wouldn't worse but I had a bad feeling aboutnthat. Sadie'snPOV Inwas going to have to work with my enemy, the boy who bullied me sincenelementary school. I couldn't believe my luck, now we were going tonhave to work together outside of school which meant the possibilitynof him coming over to my house or seeing I do everyday which I knewnhe would use a way to tease me and make fun of me. I wish I couldnskip over my senior year and move to New York and enroll in NYU butnthat wasn't possible. Evennthough, I had known Jan since elementary school we lived in twondifferent worlds, he lived on the rich side of town and I was livingnon the poor side of town in a run down three bedroom house, mynbrother and sister shared one room and I had the other room while mynmother still kept her room but she was never around, she came homenfour weeks ago and all she did was rant and rave and then stomped outnwith her new boyfriend. That was my life. Thenclass ended seconds later and I got up from desk but as I started tonwalk out, I noticed that Jan was looking at me and I glanced back atnhim as he looked the other direction and I shook my head andnthought,\" This is going to be a long year.\" \"Sucks yournwith Jan.\" \"Tell me about it.\" \"You'llnlive.\" \"I hate him, he's bullied me since elementarynschool. I know your trying to help missy but you don'tnunderstand.\" \"Actually, I do. I was bullied at my oldnschool and transferred but now I don't care if anyone doesn'tnlike me. He thinks you are an easy target because you are quiet andnshy. Don't let him get to you.\" \"That's what I keepntelling myself.\" She cracked a smile and said,\" Don'tnworry Sadie, it will be fine. I'll see you later.\" Inwas hoping she would be right but I had a bad feeling about this. Anvery bad feeling.[Chapter 4] Author'snNote: This is a little different than most of my stories but here isnthe latest, I hope you like. Read and Review!

Most of the kids I went to school thought Indevoted all my time to do homework but I was usually up till aroundnone in the morning trying to finish it.

I know there is a wonderful alterative school downnthe street from Rancho Carne High.\" I smiled rememberingnpassing the school on my home, I didn't want to tell her that mynmother wasn't even around that much anymore. They would take mynsiblings away from me and put them in foster care but I had a feelingnthat she was going to find out sooner or later that my mother wasn'tnaround and I was right. \"Parent-teacher conferences arencoming up in a few weeks and I would love if your mother would comenup so we can talk about your brother. He is a fine student but Inthink the alternative school would be a better place for him.\" \"Inwill let her know and see what she can do.\" \"Thank younSadie, I will let you get back to work. Take care.\" \"Yountoo.\" I groaned inwardly knowing that she wasn't going tonbe there and I couldn't be in her place because the sub knew me andnwould figure it out. I didn't want my siblings to be taken awaynseeing that my alcoholic mother couldn't even show up and take carenof her own kids but I had to do it. This year wasn't starting outnlike I had hoped it would be.[Chapter 5] Author's Note: A chapter! Yay! There is morenbackstory to Sadie and Jan in the story, I hope you enjoy and muchnmore to come! Bluehaven4220: Glad you like it! Hope you enjoynthis one! Sadie's POV Ugh, why is there never enough time to finishneverything? Why do I feel so rushed? This is only the beginning ofnthe year and I am now feeling so stressed, out of my mind stressednout and about to collapse. First, I was partnered with Jan, then Inhad to worry about my little brother and the fact that his teachernwas worried about him and wanted him to be placed in an alterativenschool. She was sure to find out about my mother soon, at least I amnsure she would. \"Sadie!\" I smiled as my five year oldnsister Carmen rushed over when I walked and hugged my leg, I pickednher up and kissed her head and said,\" what are you still doingnup?\" \"Mama home.\" \"She's what?\" \"Younheard her. I'm home for the time being.\" \"Oh.\" \"Youndon't seem so happy to see me.\" \"Mother, you are nevernaround.\" \"Don't talk to me like I am some stranger, Inraised you and I will tolerate this from you.\" I set mynsister down and took my stuff to my room ignoring her as shencontinued to yell at me, she was an absolute drunk of a mother. Shenwas never there for us, she was usually passed out or to busy tontake care of us. It was usually a relative, my mother was a screw upnand she ruined it. She pushed her entire family away so now theyndidn't want anything to do with her or us. I was pissed, upset,nand confused as to what my mother wanted know but wished she wouldnleave, it made my life easier when she was gone. No one at schoolnknew about my personal life, that would give them leverage to teasenme more than they already did, I was already worried about thisnproject with Jan knowing that it would awful. Working with the boynwho bullied me relentlessly since elementary school. \"Sadie?\" \"Charlie, come on in here. Inwant to talk to you.\" I heard him groan, I cleared off mynbed as he plopped down on the bed and asked,\" Why is mom here?\" Inshrugged. \"I don't know Charlie, I am as baffled as younare.\" \"Why does she have to show up now?\" Inshrugged once more not having an answer for my mother, since she hadnleft us so much to fend for ourselves the two of us wanted nothingnto do with her but my sister was too young to understand why ournmother would do this to us, she would leave for weeks and thennsuddenly show up with a new boyfriend or wanting something from us. Now that she was here and not knowing how long shenwould be here frustrated and upset me, she always wanted somethingnand I knew that if she showed up when Jan was here or if he hadnfound out my life, he would make it even worse than it was before.nHe didn't have a caring bone in his body especially for me, wennever talked other than when he teased me. nWhy oh why did I have to be partnered with Jan? Jan's POV \"Jan, sweetheart will you quit cracking yournknuckles? You know how I hate it when you do that.\" \"Sorrynmom.\" \"What's bothering you?\" I was sitting innthe living room with my mother while she was trying to watch anrepeat of Law and Order, I was thinking about this project and hownbeing seen with Sadie Gilliam would ruin my image and reputationnwhich I kept in tact for the last three years. \"My partner for that English project is SadienGilliam.\" \"She's such a nice girl.\" \"Mom,nshe's boring.\" \"Don't talk about her that way. Youndon't even know her, she may not be as boring as you think she is.nJan, you are something else.\" I sighed. \"Mom, you don'tnunderstand. If I am seen outside of school with her, my reputationnis ruined.\" \"You are going to have a reality check whennyou get out of high school, no one cares about how popular younare.\" \"Mom, can we talk about something else? You haventold this to me many times before.\" \"You started it withncracking your knuckles.\" I sighed. \"I didn't start anything mom. It'sna habit of one.\" \"Well get rid of it.\" I sighed. \"I can't, it's stuck with me fornlife.\" \"You can get rid of some of habits, your going tonhave to if you want to survive in the real world.\" \"Willnyou quit lecturing me about that? I didn't' come in here fornthat.\" She sighed and concentrated on her show, I had anlove hate relationship with my mother and right not it was in thenhate mode. She really knew how to get under my skin but it's thenway she was, my dad was extremely wealthy and he met my mother whennthey were both in college and married soon after she graduated, shenis one of the top prosecutors in our county but she's veryndifferent than my mother, she grew from nothing and made her lifenout of something unlike what most of the people she grew up withnthought and that's one of the reasons we had a love hatenrelationship. In a way, my mother was from the wrong side of thentracks but she earned the love and respect that she wanted from myndad's folks who grew to love her, they first they she wasn'tngood enough for him but they pulled through it. I love my mom, mostnof the time but sometimes it's hard to have a conversation withnher. It's the way life was. Sadie's POV \"So today is the day.\" Maybenhe's sick, maybe he won't show up and then I won't have tontalk to him. Ugh, why am I acting like this? This is stupid, I justnwant to get this project over with. I knew he was feeling the samenway but I knew this wasn't going to be easy. The author that wenwere going to do our project on was John Stienbeck, who was one ofnmy favorite authors so that wouldn't be so hard for me. I walked into the room hoping that he wasn'tnthere but I looked in the back and he was talking to Leslie Smith,none of the popular girls sitting in the back; she always woreneverything so short so if you looked you basically saw everythingnthat you didn't want to see, she was snotty, rude, and a veryncrude person especially to me. Jan wasn't exactly looking at hernbut he was looking at her chest like he always did with half of thengirls he hung out with, he was a womanizer. \"Alright, lets get going. We have many things toncover.\" Jan snorted and sat down as our English teachernsmiled and said,\" First, it's time to get with your partners andnstart setting up what you are going to do.\" I looked at Jannwho reluctantly walked over and plopped down in the desk next tonmine and said,\" So.\" \"Look Jan, I don't want to donthis anymore than you do so lets just get this over with.\" \"Gladnwe are on the same page.\" I smiled and said,\" I willnstart looking up some things on John Stienbeck if you could look onnthe internet, I work at the regional library so that won't be tonhard for me.\" \"You work there?\" I nodded. \"YesnI do. I have two jobs and that's one of them.\" \"Oh, Indidn't know that.\" \"There's anlot that you don't know.\" \"We are going to have to work together outside ofnschool on this.\" \"Don't remind me.\" I smiled.n\"We could do it after school or at the library or someplace.\" \"Wenmight have to work at mine or yours. I'll let you know.\" \"Okay,nthat's fine with me. So are we covered for now?\" Hennodded and got up from the desk and walked over to his seat, I onnthe other hand was happy that went smoothly, he must still be halfnasleep or had a rough night. He is usually crude to me and most ofnthe time he barely says a word to me. That's how most of thenpeople in this school treat me expect for a few.[Chapter 6] Author'snNote: A long chapter and you could see Missy's POV, I wanted it to benthat way so here we go. Read and Review! Bluehaven4220:nYou will have to wait and see when Jan does help her out, it won't bensoon but later on and you will see a lot of drama between the two.nGlad you like:) Nownthat wasn't so bad, I just had to make to the library so I could looknsome stuff up or I could ask someone to do it for me, pay someone sonI wouldn't have to do the work. Naah, i'll do it. But it wasn't sonbad, at least we were on the same page and I just had to find out ifnwe were going to work together at her place or mine, I didn't have anclue where she lived and I honestly could care less. \"Hey.\" Insnapped out of my thoughts to see Missy standing by the next to menand asked,\" What do you want?\" She snorted. \"Insee your time with Sadie wasn't so bad. The girl dosen't have andisease even though you treat her like she does.\" \"Incan't believe you actually hang out with her. She's a loser.\" \"Hownwould you know?\" Shenbeat me. I didn't have an answer for her, for once. I never hung outnwith Sadie and I never will, she was a loser and she would always benone. \"Well?\" \"Fine,nI don't know but she is a loser.\" \"You're a dick younknow that. She's done nothing to you and you treat her likenshit.\" \"Dyke.\" Now we were both standingnup and this was a first, I was about to get into a fight with a girl. \"Whatnare you actually going to fight me? Everyone calls me a dyke, yournnot the first person to call me that. I'm not going to fight you butnif you so dare hurt Sadie, I will hurt you. She's a good person, younare just to stupid to see that.\" I snorted as she walkednoff and thought,\" What in the hell is she talkingnabout?\" Sadie'snPOV Well,nit wasn't as bad as thought I would be. I mean, I knew that thingsncould get worse but maybe it wouldn't be that bad. Oh who was Inkidding? It was going to be hell. I couldn't even imagine him comingnto my place, he would want to run for his life. I don't know if Incould bare him seeing my place and seeing how I live, that would givenhim leverage to tease me even more than he already did. \"Sadie?\" Insnapped out of my thoughts to see Missy standing by the filingncabinet which was close to my desk and I asked,\" What'snup?\" \"Not much, you alright?\" \"I'mnfine, I was just thinking.\" It was the middle of classnand we were working our assignment which was due tomorrow, I wasnclose to being done as usual. \"Don'tnworry about Jan, he won't be much of a bother to you.\" \"ThanksnMissy. I think it will be okay.\" \"He needs to grownup, you haven't done anything to him. He's a stupid little rich boynthat thinks he deserves everything on a silver platter. It's callednKarma and he will get his someday.\" \"I know he willnand I am waiting for that but I don't think will happen.\" \"Itnwill. Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to hang out thisnweek?\" \"Um, I don't know. I work all week.\" \"Well,nif you have a free day we could do something. I could come over tonyour house or you could come over to mine.\" \"I willnlet you know when I'm free.\" \"Alright, see younlater.\" \"Bye.\" Shit, now she wanted toncome over to my house. I couldn't let anyone come over, I didn't wantnthem to see the way I lived. I knew Missy wouldn't say or do anythingnand the only person who had actually seen my house was Les. I hadnknown him since middle school, I didn't consider him to be a bestnfriend but he was a close one that I could count on. Maybe I couldntalk to him. Thenbell rang and I hurried out of the classroom as I could hear Jannyell,\" You don't wanna be late for your next class sadie!!! Antardie is a no no!!\" I was embarrassed but used to it butnI could still hear laughter erupting from everyone that I passed. Inshrugged it off my shoulders until I heard someone call my name andnturned to see the person I was looking for. Les. \"HeynSadie, don't listen to him.\" \"I won't.\" Henwalked over to me and threw his arm around me as I smiled and said,\"nHi Les.\" He smiled. \"How are you? I hear you arenpartners with Jan.\" \"I am. I don't like it anymorenthan he does but there is nothing I can do about it. I just have tonwork with him and get it over with.\" \"You have suchna positive attitude, more than I would. He's a pretty boy that thinksnthe world revolves around him.\" \"Have you talked tonMissy?\" He nodded. \"She talked about you and I knownshe wants to be friends with you.\" \"The firstnperson.\" He shrugged. \"Don't talk like that.\" \"It'sntrue.\" \"It is not Sadie.\" I shrugged andnsaid,\" She wants to hang out but I don't know if I want her toncome over. I'd be embarrassed.\" \"Inthink you should invite her over. It's not like she's going to tellnanyone and I know you've been going through a lot with your mom butnyou need this. Have Missy come over and you two can talk. She wantsnyou to open up more, that's what she told. She knows your holdingnback and I told her that your life wasn't exactly picture perfect andnthat's all I said.\" As much I hated to admit it, he wasnright. I did need friends and I liked Missy, she was different andnthe fact that someone wanted to be my friend made me happy. Maybe itnwouldn't hurt. Bynthe end of the day, I made plans with Missy to hang out tonight. Shenwas coming over and we were going to finish this homework fromnenglish and hang out. I was excited and a little nervous but I knewnmaybe this would be a good start to fix my broken life. Missy'snPOV SonI was finally going to hang out with Sadie, I was happy about that.nShe was a nice girl and besides hanging out with Torrance, the headncaptain of the cheerleading squad I could use a new friend. It wouldnbe a great begining for me, I needed one and then maybe I could teachnJan a lesson that Sadie wasn't a boring person at all. He needed anfoot shoved up his ass and I wanted to be the one to do it. \"Sonthis is where she lives?\" It was completely the oppisitenfrom where I lived, she lived in a three bedroom run down house onnthe otherside of town. It looked like it hadn't been had a nice paintnjob in a few years and the yard looked unkept. Inmade my way to the house and I could hear Sadie's voice and she wasnyelling at someone and I figured she had siblings. I knew thenfeeling, I had a younger brother and he was a pain but that's the waynit works. Inknocked on the door and seconds later Sadie opened the door and Inwalked in seeing that her place was extremely small, I noticed anyoung girl around five years old sitting on the couch curling hernbrown curly hair in her fingers eagerly waiting for the commerical tonbe over to she could watch whatever she was watching, probablyncartoons. \"HinSadie.\" \"Hi Missy.\" \"So this isnyour place?\" She blushed. \"This is where I live.nThat is my younger sister Carmen, I would introduce you to her butnshe's gets mad if you interrupt her while she watching herncartoons.\" I smiled. \"I was like that when I wasnlittle.\" \"I have a younger brother but he'snupstairs.\" \"What about your mother?\" Shenwinced and I knew I hit a soft spot so I quickly changed the subjectnand asked,\" Did you finish your homework?\" \"Almostndone. Can we work in the dining room? She gets fussy when I leave forna longtime.\" \"Sure thing.\" Oncenwe got started on the homework I asked,\" Sadie, I don't mean tonpry but where is your mom? Shouldn't she be home?\" Sadienset her stuff down and said,\" I don't know where she is, shennever comes around. She's an alcholic and I'm raising my twonsiblings. She comes around once in awhile but it's usually becausenshe wants something from me. My dad passed away when I was youngernand my relatives raised us until it was too much for them to take. Inknow that seems harsh but my mother has caused a lot of grief for us,nI work two jobs and try to raise them.\" \"Does Jannknow? Is that why he teases you so much?\" \"Hendosen't know or no one expect Les knows. I've known Les since middlenschool and he's my only friend other than you.\" \"Sadie,nyou can't raise your siblings on your own. That's way to much for onenperson to handle. Have you talked to child servies or whatever it'sncalled?\" \"Nope. I can do it.\" \"So,nJan doesn't know about this?\" \"No but he's bound tonfind out soon. We have to work out whose house we are going to worknat.\" \"Sadie,nI feel bad. I didn't want you to feel like you had to tell me thisnbut I'm glad you did. If you ever need any help, call me please.\" AllnSadie did was smile politely in return and then focused back on hernwork, I knew inside that she felt better about telling me this. MaybenI could talk to Les and see what he thought. I was pissed andnupset, Sadie was putting too much on her shoulders and I knew she wasngoing to crack soon, you could see it in her eyes how tired she was.nI couldn't let her go through this alone, she needed help and I wasngoing to help her as much as I could. I was also going to give Jan anpiece of my mind, whether he liked it or not.[Chapter 7] Author'snNote: here is the next update, I am having a little trouble with thisnstory with trying to get them together, I have an idea but I'm notnsure if it will work so we'll have to see. Please read and review! Bluehaven4220:nyes, missy will be a big help to Sadie, glad you like. Song:n\"Don't Bring Me Down\"-Electric Light Orchestra, I don't ownnit so don't sue me, I am poor. Sadie'snPOV SonI told Missy and the truth was, it helped. It felt good to know thatnsomeone cared about me, my mother and relatives sure as hell didn't.nI know my siblings loved me but the fact that someone did care andnwould be willing to help me out made me feel a lot better, I likednMissy. We didn't do much expect talk and work on our homework, I hadndone a little research for the project earlier and printed it off andnhad it with me to bring to class so I just hoped Jan would do hisnpart. I had a feeling that it wouldn't be that way. \"Younshouldn't have to worry about Jan.\" I smiled. \"I'mnused to him, he's a jerk and I've known that for years. It's not likenhe's going to come over to my place and see what I've gone throughnand change, I highly doubt something like that would happen,nespecially with Jan.\" She snorted. \"You are right,nthat is likely but he needs to learn his lesson that not everythingnin life is easy and he will find that out the hard way.\" \"Allnof them will find it out the hard way.\" \"You arenright Sadie, it's called Karma.\" I smiled as she begannpacking up her things and she said,\" I'll see you tomorrow, ifnyou want maybe we can grab lunch tomorrow.\" \"That'dnbe great.\" \"Don't worry Sadie, you can call me ifnyou need me.\" \"Thanks Missy, I will.\" Afternshe left, I closed the door and locked up the house and began tongather up my things and take them to my room. It had been a longnnight and I had another busy day tomorrow, it was close to elevenno'clock and I still needed to take a shower and head to bed. I workedntomorrow till nine and then the next night till ten. I worked at thenlocal diner down the street serving and sometimes I closed up thenplace. Then, I came home, made sure my brother and sister werenasleep, and then finished my home and either took a shower or went tonbed. That was my life in a nutshell. Jan'snPOV Shit,nI forgot to print off that stuff last night. Oh well, I can give itnto her tomorrow when we work on our stuff. We had a test today andnthen that was it, it was a small pop quiz but I wasn't prepared fornit. I was never prepared for tests, not in my lifetime. Inwalked into English class book in hand hoping that maybe she wasn'tnthere but alas she was, Sadie was sitting in the back of thenclassroom engrossed in her current book. What a nerd. \"Sadie?\" Shenlooked up from her book and said,\" Yeah? Did you print thatnstuff off?\" \"Nope, I forgot to do that. I'll bringnit tomorrow.\" She smiled. \"Ok. Be sure that you do.nWe have to work on it tomorrow.\" I nodded. \"Inwill.\" She returned to her book as I made my way over tonsee my seat seeing Carter sitting down and said,\" She's such annerd.\" \"She was the first one in the room.\" Insnorted. \"Sadie is such a dork. I can't believe he parterned hernwith me of all people in the room.\" \"Sucks to benyou.\" Innodded. \"Sure does, are you going to Courtney's partyntonight?\" \"Probably, folks are out of town and she'sngot a ton of booze. Should be a good time.\" \"I wouldnhope.\" He snorted. \"So when are you and Sadiensupposed to work on the project?\" \"Whonknows.\" \"That is going to suck but it's not likenanything is going to happen, she'll still be a nerd after wengraduate.\" I laughed knowing that would be the truth, shenwould still be a nerd after this and probably go to UCLA or wherevernshe wanted to go as for me, I was heading to USC and was stoakednabout that, I was probably going to be in a fraterinity like my dad.nHe graduated from USC and so did his father so it's a family affair.nIt's a big deal. Sadie'snPOV Bynthe end of the night, I was about ready to collaspe. I feltnemotionally exhausted and it didn't help matters that my mothernshowed up around the time I was leaving with her new boyfriend, hendidn't seem to friendly so I needed to keep my distance. The last fewnhadn't stayed long but she did have one that was with her for ancouple of years and he took his anger out on me. Itnalso didn't help that I was cornerned by Courtney in the bathroom,nshe was making fun of me as usual and always liked it to rub it in mynface that I would always be the nerdy girl and never make anything ofnmyself but that's where she was wrong, I would make something ofnmyself and prove everyone wrong. Prove that I could make my life outnof nothing and put it into something, I could do it. \"Sonyour finally home.\" I grimaced as I brushed past her andnuttered,\" Yes I'm home.\" \"About time. Yournsister has been crying and yelling for the past hour for you.\" \"Whatndoes she want?\" \"You.\" I walked past hernand down to my sister and brothers room, I could hear the two of themntalking quietly so I knew he was trying to calm her down. I openednthe door and walked into the room as Carmen smiled and ran over to menand I picked her up and asked,\" What's wrong?\" \"Wendon't like mom's new boyfriend.\" \"Do we ever?\" Henshrugged. \"Nope but we really don't like him. He is really loudnand yells constantly.\" \"Hurts my hears Sadie.\" \"I'mnsorry sweetie, try and get some sleep. I don't know if I'll be homentomorrow for supper but Mrs. Jacobson will get it ready for the twonof you.\" \"Okay. Goodnight Sadie, I love you.\" \"Inlove you both.\" I kissed both of them on the head andnwalked out of the room after turning on Carmen's nightlight and madenmy way into the kitchen when I hear my mother yell,\" Sadie! Twonbeers!\" I opened the fridge and saw a twenty four pack ofnbud light and a twelve pack of coors light so I knew they were goingnto be here for awhile which I didn't need especially with thenprospect that Jan might come over here and work on our project. Inwalked out to the living room and handed the beers to my mother whonjust nodded and said,\" Richard, this is Sadie.\" \"Hi.\" Hengrunted so I took that as a hello, that's most of her boyfriends do.nThey usually yell and scream at her or they don't say anything atnall. That's what my mother's life was like, sometimes I wished thatnmy father was still alive and then everything would be okay. Atnleast, it would better than this.[Chapter 8] Author'snNote: Here is the next one, this will be the beginning of Jan's andnSadie's relationship changing and more drama to come. Bluehaven4220:nYour review made me think of a really good idea and an interventionnwill happen but not for awhile. Song:n\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide\"-The Beatles. I don'tnown it, we've been through this before. Sadie'snPOV Incan do this, I don't need anyone's help. I can take care of mynsiblings, work two jobs and finish my senior year and be ready fornNYU or Loyola Maraymount which was my second dream school, if Indidn't get into either of them then I would possibly apply at UCLA ornUCSF. I arrived at school a little earlier than I had done in thenpast, I hoped Jan would have the stuff but I had a feeling that henmight not, I had heard from Missy that Courtney's parents were out ofntown and she was throwing a huge party so I had a feeling that henprobably wouldn't even show up to school which would make my lifeneasier. \"HeynSadie.\" I jumped at the sound of Torrance's voice andnsaid,\" Oh hi Torrance, I didn't hear you.\" Shensmiled. \"It's okay, you looked deep in thought.\" \"Inprobably was, did you want something?\" \"I know yournpartners with Jan.\" I nodded. \"I am and it's beennokay so far.\" \"Try not to let him bother you. I knownhe can be crude and mean but it's just the way he is and he'll getnover himself someday.\" \"I know that and I won't letnhim get to me. It's not like him being around me is going to changenhim.\" She snorted. \"Nothing could change him, he isnjust going to have to grow up someday and grow up to his faults.\" Insmiled. \"You are right but thanks Torrance. I'll see younlater.\" \"Your welcome.\" Jan changingnhimself when he was around me, fat chance that would actually happen.nHe was in for a cruel reality check once he graduated from highnschool and entered into the real world, it was harder than it seemed.nI was used to it and I could deal with it and I knew he couldn't. WhennI made it into the room, he was already there and sitting in the backnwith his head on the desk and I figured he had a rough night whichnconsisted of drinking and partying with the popular crowd. Henlifted his head and his eye caught mine and he nodded and rose fromnthe desk with his notebook in his hand and moved closer to mine andnhe said,\" Lets get this overwith. We are going to need to worknon this stuff tonight, I can't tomorrow or for the next couplendays.\" I smiled. \"Okay.\" \"We can'tndo it at mine because my parents are doing fixing up the dining roomnand living room so no one is allowed in there. How about yournplace?\" \"That would be fine.\" I prayednand hoped my mother wouldn't be home and my siblings would behave, Inhoped that everything would be work out. I pulled out a piecenof paper as he waited and I wrote down my address and handed it tonhim and said,\" I get off work at five and then I'll be home, isnthat fine?\" He nodded. \"I'll be over aroundnthen.\" Jan would be at my house tonight. What in the hellnwas I thinking when I said that would be fine? I knew it wouldn't. Jan'snPOV SonI was going over to Sadie's house to work, that would be interesting.nI had never been to her house and from the looks it wasn't close tonwhere I lived. I didn't mind making the trip though but I just wantednto get this project over with so I could graduate. I was feeling anlittle buzzed from last night, I had a rough night at Courtney's andnthat was just too much for me to handle. She was beginning to drivenme insane, I love Courtney don't get me wrong but sometimes she cannbe a handful. \"SonI hear you have a date with Sadie.\" I snorted. \"No,nit's not a date. I wish I didn't even have to do this but I wanted tonget this done as fast as possible. The quicker I get this done, thenless time I have spend with her.\" Carter smiled.n\"True.\" It was close to the end of the day and I wasnheading to cheerleading practice, we were doing pretty well with thenexpection of missy who always made a point to crack jokes on me withnTorrance, I ignored her just as much as Les was beginning to ignore.nWe were friends but not close or anything but I liked the guy, he wasngood person but I knew he was one of Sadie's good friends and didn'tnlike me for the fact that I cracked jokes on her all the time,nwhatever. \"HeynJan.\" I snorted as Torrance made her way over to me andnsaid,\" Hey Tor.\" \"How are you feeling?\" \"Anlittle better. You need something?\" \"Les wants tontalk to you.\" Insighed and said,\" thanks.\" I walked over to Les whonwas working out and said,\" You wanted to see me.\" \"Yeah,nI know you are going over to Sadie's tonight.\" \"YeahnI am.\" \"Don't make her life worse than it alreadynis.\" \"What do you mean already?\" \"You'llnfind out. It's not my place to tell you. \" \"Alright,nis that it?\" \"That's it.\" Whatnin the hell is he talking about? What could possibly be so horriblenabout her life? I was bound to find out tonight. Sadie'snPOV Inwas hoping that my mother and her new squeeze would be gone, he wasnnot my cup of tea but none of them were. They were usually loud,nabusive, annoying, and like to drink booze like my mother. It wasnhard enough knowing that she was home and would be here for awhile, Inwould be mortified if she came home drunk while Jan was here. Thatnwould be enough for me to not show up to school. \"Isnmama here?\" \"No, she left and told us she wouldn'tnbe back for awhile.\" I breathed a sigh of relief andnsaid,\" I have someone coming over tonight to work on ournproject.\" Carmen giggled. \"Missy?\" \"No,nsweetie not missy but someone else. Will you two promise to behavenfor me please?\" The two nodded. \"We willnSadie.\" \"Good, now I will fix you two dinner beforenhe comes over.\" \"Who is it Sadie?\" \"Jan.\" \"Isn'tnthat the guy that makes fun of you?\" \"Yes, he is butnplease don't say anything to him. I get teased enough of him alreadynand I don't want to be teased anymore.\" \"We won'tnSadie.\" I smiled knowing that they wouldn't and glad thatnmother wasn't around, I hoped everything work out. Jan'snPOV Thisnplace is a dump, she lives here. I was standing outside of Sadie'snhouse not sure if this was really it. It was a total dump, it lookednlike it hadn't had a paint job in a couple of years and the shadesnwere drawn to make it look like she was asleep or didn't want anyonento look in. Just as I was about to leave, the shades were opened upnand I saw her looking out the window and I shrugged and walked to thendoor and seconds later she opened the door and said,\" Hi Jan,ncome on in.\" She opened the door and I looked around hernplace which was the complete oppisite of mine, it was small, dingy,nand not a lot of open space. I looked into the living room to see herntwo siblings watching television. \"Inthought I had the wrong place.\" \"No this is it.\" Inshrugged. \"It's tiny.\" She shrugged and said,\"nI know, there isn't much room. We can do this in the diningnroom.\" \"Sounds fine to me.\" I walkedndown the hall and into the another small room with a huge table andnchairs and threw my stuff down and asked,\" I didn't know you hadnsiblings.\" \"I do, they are younger thannme.\" \"Where's your mom?\" She winced andnthat was the first time I knew and felt I hit a nerve, I quicklynchanged the subject and asked,\" So did you print yournstuff?\" \"I did, it's upstairs. Hold on, I'll go getnit.\" She rushed upstairs as I plopped down in one of thenchairs and looked around the room, the walls were light blue and theynwere covered with paintings or pictures. Mostly of Sadie of hernsiblings, I didn't even know she had any. Secondsnlater, she came back into the room and we started to work on ournstuff and she said,\" I know this isn't fun at all and trust me,nI don't like it that much but the faster we get this done thenbetter.\" \"Sadie, I don't mean to pry but shouldn'tnyour mother be home?\" She didn't say anything at all andnI knew I hit a nerve, her face lost it's color and she folded hernhands in her lap and then said,\" She's not here. She's nevernaround, she comes around sometimes but it's only if she wantsnsomething. I work two jobs and take care of my siblings and try andnbe there for them. My mother is an alocholic. Always has been. It'snbeen like since I met you Jan, I started working two jobs when I wasna freshman.\" \"So,nshe never comes around.\" She looked at me and said,\"nNever. Sometimes she shows up with her boyfriends but that's it. Myndad died when I was extremely young and my mother is a screw up andndamaged her relationship with her parents and sister and by the timenI was a freshman we were left fending for ourselves.\" Suddenly,nI felt like I had been punched in the stomach. I didn't know Sadie'snlife was like this. Truth be told, I felt like a jerk.[Chapter 9] Author'snNote: Here is the next chapter, this is the beggining of Sadie's andnJan's relationship changing and you will see a different side to Jannin the next couple chapters. Bluehaven4220:nyes he does! he will be a big help to her in the future. Glad younlike. Saide'snPOV Sonhe knew, I couldn't tell what he thought. For once, he was actuallynquiet and that was a first. He didn't say a word after I told himnabout my life and what I had gone through. I wasn't exactly sure hownhe felt or the thoughts going through his mind, I didn't know how henfelt for once. He was speechless. Suddenlynhe looked up at me and said,\" I didn't have a clue Sadie. DoesnLes or Missy know about this?\" I nodded. \"They arenthe only two who know. No one else, I am too embarrassed.\" \"Younshouldn't be. You can't do this on your own.\" \"Incan do this, I've been doing this for years and I can do it. I justnpace myself and take my time.\" \"What are you goingnto school after you gradute?\" \"UCLA or NYU.\" \"Whatnabout your siblings if you get into NYU?\" \"I willnmove them with me. I can do this Jan, i've been doing it for years. Inhave a much different life than you.\" \"What's thatnsupposed to mean?\" \"You have had everything given tonyou on a silver platter and I have had to work hard for everything,nfrom the day I met you in elementary school you bullied me because Inwas different and I didn't follow the crowd much like you. I'm myselfnand I like who I am, you are with the popular crowd and haveneverything given to you. You like the easy way out and sometimes lifendosen't work out that way and I've come to terms with that but Indon't think you have. You may think I am being harsh but it's thenhonest truth, your selfish, self absorbed, concieted, and everythingnalways has to be about you. If it's not, you get upset and forcenpeople to follow your way.\" Insat there as he swallowed everything I said, trying to come back withna quick comment but for once he couldn't. He sat there slumped overnin the chair shaking his head as I got up and said,\" If you'llnexcuse me, I have to go to bed and get ready for tomorrow. We've donenenough for tonight.\" \"You got it wrong Sadie. I'mnnot like that.\" \"Keep telling yourself that Jan.\" Indidn't see him out but seconds later, I heard the door and heard himnspeed off and for once I could've cared less, everything I said aboutnJan was true. There is no way he would change, not in this lifetime. Jan'snPOV She'snwrong. I'm not like that, I care about my friends and I am myself. Indon't follow the crowd, she's got it all wrong. Stupid Sadie Gilliam.nBut what if she was right? She couldn't be. I was feeling a rush ofnevery emotion possible but Les's comment about Sadie's life not beingnwhat I thought was catching me off guard, she couldn't possible benokay having done that for the last four years, she was right that Inhave had everything given to me and I really haven't worked hard fornit but it's the way I was raised. AsnI walked into the house, I heard my mother in the kitchen and walkednin and asked,\" Everything okay?\" She jumped at thensound of my voice, she regained her composure and responded,\"nEverything is fine.\" I smiled as she asked,\" How didnyour study date go?\" I shrugged. \"It was an eyenopener.\" \"How so?\" \"I don't feelnlike talking about it now, maybe tomorrow.\" She looked anlittle confused, I walked over to her and said,\" It's fine, I'llntalk to you about it tomorrow.\" \"Alright.\" Inwalked upstairs to my room thinking over what Sadie had told me, Inknew she would be at school tomorrow and I also knew that we wouldnhave to work together, our teacher planned it out so that some of thendays we work on our projects in class. I didn't mind it but tomorrownwasn't going to be easy. Missy'snPOV Somethingnwas up and I couldn't figure out what. Jan seemed sullen and quietnfor some reason and Sadie didn't even bother to look at him earliernin English, the only time they talked was when they had to work onnthere projects and that was it. Now, I was in cheerleading and it wasnclose to end and I noticed Jan kept looking at me and I turned aroundnasked,\" You need something?\" \"I wanted to talknto you.\" \"What for?\" He signed. \"Injust want to talk to you.\" \"Ok, what's up?\" Thentwo of us were outside and I asked,\" Does this have anything tondo with Sadie?\" \"How did you know?\" \"Younweren't your usually charming self to her in English and you seemednsullen and grumpy earlier.\" \"I went over to Sadie'snlast night and we ended up getting into an arugment. She saidnsomethings to me and I got upset.\" \"What did shensay?\" \"She called me selfish, self centered,nconciented, insensative, and told me that I follow the crowd and Indon't do my own thing.\" I snorted and thought,\"nSadie has him pegged.\" I looked at him and said,\"nJan, I hate to say it but it's true. You are a very selfish person,nI've seen that since the beginning, since the day I met you. You areninto yourself and if someone tries to take your place, you getnpissed. You are blind to who you really because I don't even thinknyou know. You are surrounded by fake people.\" \"But.\" \"Nonbuts about it, I can tell you a few other people who feel the samenway.\" \"What are you two talking about?\" Wenturned around to see Les walking over to us he said,\" Sadie toldnme about the night before, I caught her before she left fornwork.\" \"What did she say?\" \"Nothingnother than she didn't feel any different than last night, she wasnglad she told you off. It was a long time coming Jan, you've been anprick to her since day one because was quiet and shy and not gettingna chance to get to know her, she was different and you didn't likenthat for some reason. She's not a bad person, you two are differentnin a way that you've had everything handed to you and she's had tonwork for everything she has gotten.\" I saw the color innJan's face change and I said,\" The truth hurts doesn'tnit?\" Before he could say anything, I walked off with Les.nThe two of us had been hanging out recently and I liked him but onlynas a friend. I hoped I would see a change in Jan but at the same timenI knew that would impossible. Jan'snPOV Thentruth does hurt, it hurt more than I thought possible. Hearing thatnfrom three people was enough, I was starting to think that maybe theynwere right. Maybe I was a selfish person, maybe what Sadie said to menwas true. Just maybe.[Chapter 10] AuthorsnNote: Another update! i hope you enjoy, you will see a different sidenof Jan from now on and his relationship with Sadie will progress innfuture chapters. Enjoy!

Jan'snPOV \"HeynMom, you have a few?\" \"Sure do. What's on yournmind?\" \"Inwent over to Sadie Gilliam's house last night and she told mensomethings and I'm finding it hard to beleive.\" \"What?nThat you've had everything handed to you on a silver platter.\" \"Howndid she know?\" Shenchuckled at the expression on my face and said,\" Jan, I've triednto tell you that for years. You have had everything given to you likenyour father. Your dad used to be the same way until I met him and Input him in his place which I am assuming that's what Sadie did andnyou didn't want to believe it.\" \"That'snright.\" \"What did she say?\" \"That Inwas selfish, self absorbed, concieted, and I followed the crowd and Inwasn't myself. I hang out with fake people.\" \"I hatento break it to you sweetheart but she's got you pegged. I've tried tontell you all that in the nicest way possible but it never worked andnfather told me to let it go and you'd find out for yourself.\" Insank down into the chair and said,\" What about mynfriends?\" \"I've never liked Carter and neither hasnyour father but you two hit it off so we never said anything, yournfriends are in for a cruel reality check when they graduate. I knownthis is hard for you to take but the truth sets you free and helpsnyou realize your faults and helps you grow up as a person.\" \"Havenyou talked to Sadie since then?\" \"No, she won't talknto me.\" \"I suggest you try talking to her and see ifnthat gets your anywhere, aplogize and try to talk to her. You nevernknow, it may help you out in the end.\" \"She won'tnlisten to me, I've made fun of her and made her life miserable sincenelementary school. I highly doubt she wants to talk to me.\" \"Arenyou afraid of your friends seeing you asking to talk to her? Is thatnwhy?\" Insighed but she was right, a part of me was afraid that I would getnridculued for talking to Sadie. She wasn't popular and wasn't in thenin crowd but as of last night, I wasn't exactly sure that the peoplenI hung out were my real friends. \"Intake that as a yes. Just talk to her. Trust me, it will make andifference in the end.\" Sadie'snPOV Ugh,nI need more adderall. I am almost out and that's what help keeps mengoing, it helps me stay awake on late nights so I can get thingsndone. I am not addicted to it. I just use it to help me stay awakenand I needed it tonight because I had so much to do. I was stillnworking on the project with Jan, didn't speak to him today but henseemed to be in a bad mood so I'm sure he was still soaking in when Inripped into him. Inheard a knock on the door and I groaned and looked at the clock andnit was nearly midnight and I thought,\" Who could this be?\" Inturned off my cd player and and opened my door and walked downstairsnand opened the door to see Jan standing there and I asked,\" Whatnare you doing here?\" \"I came to give you this. Inprinted it off earlier and I knew you needed it. Let me know when youncan work on this. I am free all this week.\" I smilednlooking down at the papers and he said,\" I've been thinkingnabout what you said Sadie and I feel like a jerk.\" Indidn't know whether he was serious or joking, I looked at his facialnexpression and couldn't exactly tell. Inclutched the papers in my hand and said,\" Can we talk about thisnanother time? I have a lot of work to do. I had to work a late shiftnand now I have so much crap to do.\" \"Your motherncome home yet?\" I shook my head. \"No. I have to getngoing Jan. Thanks for the stuff.\" He smiled and walkednoff, I closed the door and leaned back against it and hugged myselfnfeeling tears spring my eyes and I thought,\" Maybe he cannchange.\" Thennext day... Inarrived at school the next day a little earlier than usual and foundnmyself face to face with Carter Phelps who snorted and said,\"nYou are such a nerd.\" \"What do you wantnCarter?\" \"Quit messing with Jan.\" \"I'mnnot messing with him.\" Carter snorted. \"Then why thenhell is he ignoring me and his friends? The only reason is you. He'snbeen acting weird ever since he went over to your house. What'd youndo to him?\" \"I didn't anything Carter, just leave menalone.\" \"Carter! Leave her the hell alone!!!\" Inwas shocked, surprised, and a little confused. It was Jan. \"What?\" \"Leavenher alone and let it be. She didn't do anything to you.\" Inwas having a hard time believing this, here was Jan sticking up fornme and telling his best friend of all people to leave me alone. Whatnwas wrong with this picture? Thentwo of them were standing in the courtyard almost face to face untilnLes got in between them and said,\" Break it up boys.\" \"Younare a making a huge mistake.\" Jan shrugged him off andnmade his way over to me and placed his hand on my arm and asked,\"nAre you okay?\" Still feeling shocked and surprised Incouldn't respond but I was able to nod and he smiled back at me andnsaid,\" Good, I'll see you in English.\" \"Okay.\" Henwalked off as Les wakled over to me and asked,\" What was thatnabout me?\" \"He stood up for me and asked me if I wasnokay.\" \"Wow.\" I nodded my head innagreement as Les was clearly stunned as I was, it was different.nMaybe he could change. Maybe there was some good in him after all.[Chapter 11] Author'snNote: Here is the next chapter, I hope you enjoy and like I said younwill start seeing a different side of Jan. Bluehaven4220:ni'm glad you like Jan now, I hope you enjoy this next chapter. :) Sadie'snPOV Lifenwas getting weird, first Jan stuck up for me, then in English henoffered to take me to lunch which I accepted and I was going to meetnhim in a few. We were going out to lunch at the local diner down thenstreet from the school, at the begining of the year we signed a papernthat granted us to leave school property for lunch. \"HeynSadie!\" I smiled hearing Missy's voice and responded,\"nHi Missy.\" \"I'm sorry I missed you in englishntoday.\" \"It's okay. I am actually going out to lunchnwith Jan.\" I was putting my books away in my locker so Incouldn't see her facial expression but I knew she was mostlynsurprised, shocked, and stunned at the same time. \"You'rengoing out with who?\" \"Jan, he asked me after wenworked on our stuff. I didn't know what to say at first but he seemedngenuine.\" \"Wow.\" \"Yeah, younshould've been here earlier. He stuck up me in the courtyard and toldnhis best friend off.\" \"No freakingnway.\" \"Yes.\" \"Sadie, do you thinknhe is changing?\" I shrugged. \"I don't know Missy,nit's weird. He bullied me since the day I met him and all of sudden,nhe's been nothing but kind and generous to me.\" \"Well,njust take it slow and take your time.\" \"Inwill.\" \"Hey Sadie, you ready to go?\" Insmiled and said,\" I'm ready.\" Missy smiled at thentwo of us as I walked past her with Jan, I could tell he looked wornnout and drained and I asked,\" Are you okay?\" Henshrugged. \"I've been through a lot the past couple of days butnit's a good thing, you really opened my eyes Sadie.\" \"Butnwhat about your friends?\" \"What friends? I don'tnhave any, no one wants to talk to me but I'm not mad at you. In fact,nI should be thanking you.\" \"Nownhe knows how I feel.\" \"Youndon't have to thank me.\" \"YesnI do.\" Inshrugged as he asked,\" So do you do anything else for fun ornjust work?\" I shrugged. \"I draw and paint when Inhave free time but that's it. I try and check out art shows whenevernI can, I am going to one this week at University Of SannFransisco.\" \"Sounds interesting.\" \"Itnis, I love art. It's a way to express yourself instead of doing othernthings. I don't party or drink so that excludes from half of thensenior class who do that.\" \"Including me.\" Inblushed. \"Yes you. Why do you do it?\" \"For me,nit's a social thing. I'm out with friends having fun and drinkingnbeer and sometimes stupid things happen but that's the nature ofnit.\" \"But don't you ever think of what could happennif you get behind the wheel taking people home and you are drunk andnget into an accident. What if someone dies?\" For anmoment, he didn't respond and I knew that he couldn't think ofnanything to say, that's what he did. He went to parties, got drunk,nsomeone did something stupid and no one thought of the conseuquencesnwhich is why we are so different. I always think of the consequencesnof what could happen and usually my gut feeling always tells me if Inshould or shouldn't do this. I can't say the same for him. \"Honestly,ngetting drunk and doing something that is stupid and you might regretndoesn't sound like much fun to me but that's just my opinion.\" Incould tell that he was speechless for once so I decided to change thensubject, we were arriving at the diner and I asked,\" So how isncheerleading going?\" He seemed relieved that I changednthe subject and said,\" It's going okay, we are having a littlentrouble. Seems like Big Red who graduated last night has been copyingncheers and rotuines from an inner city school so now we arenscrambling to put together new routines.\" \"Oh wow,nI'm sorry. That must be hard. I know Missy was saying something aboutnpractices being much longer and strenous.\" He nodded.n\"They are but I think we can do it.\" This was weird,nme and Jan were sitting in the diner having a regular conversationnlike we had been friends for a long time. I didn't know what thisnmeant but I knew from now on, my life was going to be different. Jan'snPOV Inwas prepared for the backlash that was going to come from menbefriending Sadie and trying to help her, in helping her I wanted hernto be able to live a stress free life without her mother. I hadn'tnmet the woman but I was bound to sooner or later, I was also preparednto lose my so called friends. In my short time of getting to knownSadie, I realized that she wasn't as bad as I made her out to be.nSure she was quiet and shy and focused on school but now seeing hernhome life and everything she went through, I could see why. Infelt like a genuine prick when I was at her house and she told menabout her life, I made fun of her all these years for being sonstudious and serious and never wanting to have any fun. It wasn'tnthat she didn't know how, she didn't really have a chance to go outnand do something she wanted to do. I made a promise to myself to trynand change my ways and at least show her that she can still have funnbecause I think that's what she needed. Just a chance to breakawaynand not have to think about her home life. As much as she didn't wantnto admit it, I think that's what she needed.[Chapter 12] Author'snNote: Here is the next chapter, I hope you enjoy this update. Readnand review! Bluehaven4220:nyes that was very sweet of him, i'm glad you like and hope you enjoynthis one. songs:nlyrics from \"Coming Around Again\"-Carly Simon. I don't ownnthem. Sadie'snPOV Sonlife was getting extremely weird, not only did Jan take me out tonlunch but he starting to become a totally different person, I guessnwhen I told him off he really did some deep thinking and realizednthat I was right. It was an amazing turn around especially from thenperson he was before, it was as though he was a new person. It wasnhard to believe. Asnof now, I was in stress mode. Beside our english project, I had a tonnof work to do and not enough time to do it. Thank god for mynadderall. It helped me stay awake and finish my homework and getnthings done, if I didn't have it then I wouldn't able to accomplishnanything at all. But another good thing, mom dissapeared and hasn'tnbeen around so I don't have to deal with her. I didn't want Jan tonmeet her, I didn't want him to see her and have her humlitate me innfront of him. I don't think I could take that. \"Sadie,nare you okay?\" I was startled to see Jan standing by mynlocker when I arrived, I was usually the first person here but I wasnrunning a little late. \"I'mna little stressed and worn out.\" He grimaced. \"I'mnsorry, is it because of me?\" \"No Jan, it's notnbecause of you.\" Hensmiled and asked,\" Has your mom come by yet?\" \"No,nshe hasn't. I hope she doesn't.\" He grimaced as we walkedndown the hall and I asked,\" Is cheerleading getting anynbetter?\" \"Nope, still the same. Courtney's being anpain, honestly I never realized until you chatized me how much ofnpain she was. Gosh, she's awful.\" \"I'm sorry, Innever liked courtney. She always made fun of me.\" \"Shenshouldn't have.\" \"She will get hers when shengraduates and enters into the real world.\" \"Yournright. Are you doing anything this friday?\" I had tonthink for a moment and then responded,\" Not anything that Inknow, why?\" \"The football game tomorrow night isnhere, we could go out afterwards. We could do something with Missynand Les.\" I smiled. \"That would be fine.\" Hensmiled and said,\" Great. That would be fun, I'll talk tonLes.\" I smiled. \"Alright, I'll see you innEnglish.\" \"See you then.\" Maybenhe can change, maybe he can be a better person. It was weird to saynthis but I was beggining to like Jan. Jan'snPOV Inknew I was making a good start with Sadie, I was taking it one day atna time. In my little time of getting to know her, I realized shenwasn't as bad as I made her out to be. She was quiet and shy butnthere was more to her than that. I realized that she was an artist,nshe loved to draw and paint and when we were over at her house lastnnight she was showing some of her paintings and drawings I realizednthat she was a fantastic artist and when she wasn't working, takingncare of her siblings or doing schoolwork she was doing that. \"Jan,nwhat are you doing with nerdy Sadie Gilliam?\" \"She'snnot a nerd, she's much stronger than Courtney.\" Courtneynsnorted. \"Whatever you want to believe Jan.\" \"Shenis Courtney but your too snobby to see that.\" \"Shenhas got you wrapped around her little finger.\" I sighednwalking down the hall and she grabbed my shoulder and barked,\"nDon't ignore me Jan.\" I turned around and said,\"ncourtney, go bother someone else and leave me alone.\" \"Everyonenhas been talking about you, how hard you fallen on your face. Don'tnexpect to be sitting by any of us at lunch, we don't want younaround.\" \"I wasn't planning on it either.\" BeforenI could say anything else, Courtney stormed off in the otherndirection. I shook my head and thought,\" What did I ever see innher? She's a complete snob. I knew I made the right choice innchanging my ways.\" Sadie'snPOV Itnwas late when I got home and I was emotionally and physicallynexhausted from everything that had been going on, I was sick of mynmother, stunned and still shocked at the turned of Jan, exhaustednfrom work and school work. I had so much to do and such little timento do it in. I was stressed out beyond belief, things had been sonhectic. I was still waiting to hear back from UCLA, NYU, andnUniversity Of San Fransisco. I hoped I would at least get into tonNYU. I was hoping and praying for that. Inopened the door and found myself face to face with my mother who wasnon her way out, she stormed past me and said,\" You have a letternfrom NYU on the table.\" I pushed past her and found it onnthe table and I slowly opened it as she laughed and said,\" benprepared, it's not like you are going to get admitted.\" Inignored her and opened up the envelope and my face immediatly fell, Ingot rejected from my dream school. Tears streamed down my face as Inheard the door slam as my fingers began to shake and I felt like mynworld had been ripped into pieces. I was hoping and praying I wouldnget into NYU but now my dream was over. Injumped at the sound of a knock on the door and I made my way stillnholding the letter in my hand, I walked to the door and opened it tonfind Jan standing at the other end and he asked,\" Sadie, are younokay?\" \"I...I...diddn't geeettt innnn.\" \"What?\" Inlost it, I burst into tears still holding the letter in my hand; Indidn't know what Jan was thinkng until I felt his arms wrap around menand I collasped in a crying fit into his arms. I felt his fingers runnthrough my hair as I sobbed and he comforted me and said,\" ShhhnSadie.\" Mynentire world was coming apart at the seams, why did this have tonhappen to me? My dream was completely crushed. Now, what was I goingnto do?[Chapter 13] Author'snNote: Another update for you! Please read and review! This chapter isndrama and a little dark but it's sets up what's going to happen innfuture chapters. :) Bluehaven4220:nYes it does stink but jan is there to save the day. :) song:nlyrics from \"Heaven Forbid\"-The Fray, i don't own them. Saide'snPOV Whynwas he here? Why was I feeling his strong hands rub my back? Why wasnI feeling so comfortable in his warm embrace? Why was I feeling thisnway? It was Jan Robertson for crying out loud, the boy who I hatednfor bulling me for years and now he had turned around and expected mento be at ease at his sudden change, maybe I was feeling angry andnannoyed that I got rejected but him coming over wasn't helping menvery much. \"Whynare you here?\" Henlooked at me and said,\" I came to give you this. I forgot tongive it to you earlier.\" I grabbed it from his hands andnturned away from him as he grabbed my shoulder and asked,\"nWhat's wrong?\" \"What the hell do you think isnwrong?\" \"Sadie, why are you acting like this? I knownyou are angry that you got rejected from your dream school but nonneed for the harsh tone.\" \"Thanks for rubbing it in,nI can't deal with this now Jan. Just leave.\" I bit my lipnfrom crying as he backed away from me and leaving me with thesenwords,\" You know Sadie, I know I haven't been the nicest personnin the world to you but I am trying to change and if you keep pushingnpeople who want to help you away you are going to end up alone.\" Henwalked off as I turned around and shot back,\" Like you know hownI feel so quit acting like we are best friends.\" Henturned around and shot back,\" I wasn't trying to act like yournbest friend, I was just trying to help you but obviously you don'tnwant the help so I won't bother anymore.\" \"I wouldnappreciate if you stop saying I need help. I don't, I am fine.\" Hengrabbed my arms as I tried not to look at him and he said,\" Youncan't do this on your own Sadie, you are killing yourself slowly andnI won't be a part of it. You can't take care of siblings while tryingnto live your life, you work constantly and do your school work whilenhooked on adderall, I'm not stupid and I know you take it. I know younwon't quit. You need to stop this.\" I pushed him away andnstumbled into the house leaving him to stand in the yard, I closednthe door and leaned back against it letting the tears fall down mynface. I walked into the kitchen and looked outside the window to seenJan still standing outside trying to figure whether to leave or stay,nI buried my head in my hands trying not to think about what he said. Youncan't do this on your own, you are killing yourself. You are going tonend up alone, you can't keep track of your siblings all the time, younneed to live your own life. You need help. No!nI don't. Maybenyou do. Inam fine, I can do this on my own. I can take care of my siblings andnlive my life the way i want to live it. Maybenhe's right. No!nJan is not right, he is just concerned about himself. I don't neednhis help. Jan'snPOV Jesus,nshe is going to kill herself. I can't believe Sadie won't listen me,nshe needs help and she needs me. I can tell she does, I really havento prove that I can help and want to help her. What can I do? Maybe Incan talk to Missy or Les. Sadie can't do this on her own, she can't.nShe is killing herself and I can't let that happen to her. Arenyou falling in love with Sadie? Whatndo you mean? Love? I said I wanted to help her and I'm not in lovenwith her, it's a little early to be talking about love and sadie innthe same sentence. well,nyou said it yourself that it was killing you that she was doing thisnto herself didn't you? Yeah,nI did but that was just me being a concerned friend. Insighed as my mind rambled off and I tried to ignore my thoughts as Indrove home from Sadie's house after the fiasco where she went off onnme, I knew she was upset that she didn't get into NYU, her dreamnschool but something else was wrong. I knew she took adderall, when Inwas over there the last time we worked on our stuff she mentioned itnbut I didn't think to much of it. Most of the kids took it at ournschool but I was beggining to get worried, I was worried that Sadienwould take took much of it with something and overdose. I needed tontalk to Missy or Les. Thennext day... Inwalked into English the next day and looked down the isle and Sadienwasn't there, I was baffled and confused. She was always here, nevernmissed a day in her life. I was getting worried about her and Inwasn't the only one, earlier in the hallway I was stopped by Les whoncouldn't reach Sadie at home and was wondering if I had seen her, Indidn't want to tell about last night but I did and he said he wasngoing to run by her house during lunch and see if she was okay and Inwas going to go with him. \"SonI see you're girlfriend isn't here?\" I pretended not tonhear Carter as I sat down in English and he asked,\" What? Aren'tnyou going to say anything to me?\" \"Carter shutnup.\" He chuckled. \"You lost your spot in our group,nI still can't believe you hang out with Sadie Gilliam. What happenednto your hatred of her?\" \"It went away, she's ancompletely different person than I thought. You don'tnunderstand.\" \"You're right, I don't.\" Hennever would, none of them would understand. I was begining to feelnlike I was at my wits end with Sadie, I was worried about her. I hadnnever felt like before, especially with Sadie. I can now understandnher anger and anamoticity towards me because I know that I was annasshole to her but I was trying to move past that and become a betternperson, I was trying so hard. I was, at least I thought I was. Sadie'snPOV Inwas home, I had a hellish night after Jan left. I cried myself tonsleep trying not to think about what he told me, woke up around fournand began crying and throwing up but I made sure my siblings got tonschool safe. I was begining to think that maybe I did help but at thensame time, I didn't think anyone would help me. Inthrew the letter away from NYU and began looking at other options, Inwas hoping and praying that I got into UCLA, my second choice but Inknew if that didn't happen I would be out of luck if I also didn'tnget into University Of San Fransisco. Suddenly,nthere was a knock on the door and I heard Jan's voice and I shook mynhead, I was drained, exhausted, and worn out. I was emotionally andnphysically exhausted from school, work, and being a mother whilenstill being student. I didn't want any company. Inburied my head in my hands until the knocking stopped and I figurednhe left and I could feel tears streaming down my face and I knewneveryone was slipping away from me. Why was I doing this to myself? Jan'snPOV Comenon Sadie, answer the door. We know you are in there. Just as I saidnthat, I could see someone rushing down the stairs and I knew Les wasnin the car waiting for me as the door opened and Sadie appeared innthe doorway and she looked as though she hadn't slept, she lookednworn out and exhausted. She opened the door and stumbled outside as Inwalked over to her and she looked at me and I said,\"nSadie.\" \"Help.\" Was all she could answer as shencrumbled to the ground. I walked over and grabbed her as she fellninto my arms sobbing and clutching my jacket. Les walked over at thatnpoint and I responded,\" I'm going to talk to my mother.\" LikenI said, my mother was an attourney and maybe she could help us out. Inhoped, for Sadie's sake.[Chapter 14] Author'snNote: Here is the next chapter, Sadie's and Jan's relationship isnbegining to change and you will see that in the next chapters. I hopenyou enjoy this next chapter. I am SO sorry for the lack of updates, Inlost my muse for a shortwhile but regained it. Hope you enjoy! Bluehaven4220:nYes he is a good boy and you see him be a big help to her later andnmuch later see there relationship change. Hope you like one. Jan'snPOV Inwas going to talk to my mother, I was going to help Sadie. No matternhow much it took, I was going to make her life better. I wasndetermined to help her out, I had a feeling my mother would be a bignhelp, since she was a prosecutuer and she dealt with the sort ofnthing at least I hoped she would, I needed to do something and fast. \"It'sngoing to be okay Sadie, I am going to help.\" \"We allnwill.\" Les startled me a bit, I had forgotten that I wasnwith him but the more the merrier. Sadie was still shaking andnsnobbing in my arms, I had never seen someone so emotioanllyndistraught in my life but if you were in her situation you would benthe same way. I felt terrible and I felt like a bigger asshole thannbefore. Jesus, Jan why did you have to be such an asshole to her innthe first place? Insighed as she clung to me and then I pulled back and dried her eyesnas she tried to smile but ended up crying as I grimaced and said,\"nSadie, when you're siblings get off school? Maybe we could go getnthem and then go to my mother's house and we can talk.\" \"Indon't know.\" \"Sadie, Jan's going to help you. I amngoing to help you as well, give us a chance and don't push us away.\" Inthink that was her problem, people wanted to help her but she endednup pushing everyone away. People that cared for her and wanted to hernhelp but she had come to conclusion that she could do this on hernown. She didn't need or want anyone's help and that was her mindset,nit was a mindset that wasn't working anymore and now she had to takencare of herself or she would fall apart. Sadie'snPOV Sonmaybe I couldn't do this on my own, maybe I needed the help and mostnimportantly my siblings needed the help. Seeing Jan and Les here madenme nervous but anxious for the help. I didn't realize that Jan cared,nI thought what I said to him went in on ear and out the other butnmaybe I was wrong. Maybe he did listen. \"Whatntime do your siblings come home?\" \"Around three.\" Inshifted my weight and looked at Jan who looked back at me andnresponded,\" It will be okay Sadie.\" I just hoped henwas right, I hoped everything would be fine. I didn't know if itnwould be fine, I didn't want to abandon my siblings and that's what Infelt like I was doing. I didn't want to end up like my mother, not atnall. I couldn't do that to them. \"Sadie?nAre you okay?\" \"I am just thinking about stuff.\" Hensat me down on the front porch and said,\" I am going to help younSadie, I know you don't like me very much but I can help.\" \"Inhighly doubt it, what can you do?\" \"Sadie, don't benlike that. He's trying to help you.\" Inknew he was but what could he do? Why would I need to talk to hisnmother? Why now? I was bound to find that out soon. Jan'snPOV Wenwaited for her siblings to come home, I called mom while at Sadie'snand told her that I needed to talk to her. She didn't press me forninformation, I was planning on talking to her about sadie and what Incould do to help out. Looking at Sadie, I knew she wasn't in the moodnfor talking; she looked extremely wiped out and drained so I decidednnot to take her over to my house, I knew she was probably going tonpass out in her room after putting her siblings to bed. \"Saide,nwill you call me if you need anything.\" \"I will.\" Insmiled as Les kissed her head and responded,\" Call me if younneed me.\" She nodded and as I saw a tear fall down herncheek he wiped her tear as she smiled and retreated back into thenhouse, I watched as she shut the door leaving the two of us standingnoutside. I was at a loss for words, I knew that I would most likelynbe back here tonight, if I knew my mother she would tell me to takenher over here and talk to Sadie. I hoped that by telling my mothernthat somehow Sadie's life would get easier. I hoped. Thenday passed with thoughts running through my brain, mainly ones thatnwere making me think how tough I had made it for Sadie instead ofnrealizing that most kids didn't have life handed to them on a silvernplatter like me. I was begining to realize that I made her life worsenthan it already was and I felt like a prick. By the time, I got homenI was hoping my mother would be around and I was in luck, she was.nShe was sitting on the back porch reading a magazine and I asked,\"nYou busy?\" She looked up at me and said,\" No, I'mnnot sweetheart. Do you need something?\" \"I need tontalk to you.\" She set down her magazine as I took a seatnnext to her and said,\" It's about Sadie. I have found outnsomethings and I need your help.\" \"My help?\" \"Mom,nshe takes care of her siblings. Her mother is alocholic who is nevernhome. It's been like that for years, Sadie holds two jobs and takesncare of her siblings. Mom, she's losing it. She takes Adderall so shencan get her studies done, her mother comes around once in awhile it'snusually to harass Sadie.\" \"You should feel ashamednof yourself Jan.\" \"You don't even have to tell me. Inwent over to her house on my lunch with les and she was basicallynfalling apart. I told her to call me if she needed anything.\" \"Wellnseems like her mother can be taken to court. I can prove it if I talknto Sadie but I'm afraid that Sadie can't watch after her siblingsnuntil she wins gardianship of her siblings and if not they will havento be placed in foster homes.\" \"That's just it, ifnthat happens she feels like she will be abanding hernsiblings.\" \"Poor thing.\" I sighed as mynmother looked at me and said,\" See what I mean. Not everyonenlives the simple life like you do. You're friends are in for a cruelnreality check when they get into the real world. I am very glad thatnSadie gave you one, I was hoping you would realize that notneverything is easy.\" \"I do now mom.\" \"JAN!nYou have a phone call.\" I rose from my chair hoping itnwas Sadie, I picked up the phone and said,\" Hello?\" \"Jannn,ncan you come get me? Mother's here and she's not happy at all. Hernboyfriend just came in and he's looking for me. I'm afraid.\" Fearnand anger rose through me, I signaled to my mother and said,\"nI'll be there in a second Sadie, I promise.\" \"Pleaseeee.\" BeforenI could respond, the phone went dead and I was fearing that he hitnSadie. I was hopign he didn't or I'd never be able to forgive myself.[Chapter 15] Author'snNote: There is a lot of drama in this one and some language but Inthink you can handle it. I hope you enjoy this next update. Read andnreview! Bluehaven4220:nYes my muse came back! She is on a phone in her room and you willnhave to read and see what happens next! Sadie'snPOV \"Therenshe is!\" Oh no, I knew the worst was about to come. Incould see Richard, my mother's boyfriend walking into my room while Inwas cowering in the corner like a sick puppy dog that has just lostnit's mother. I knew he was going to beat me, it's what they all did. \"Looknat her! Cowering in the corner like a little lost puppy dog!\" \"Justnlike she always is.\" Ingrimaced knowing that this was about to get worse as my mother kickednme in the back and I whimpered in pain but tried to stand up as wellnbut she kept slapping me over and over and I finally grabbed her armsnand yelled,\" You are not going to do this to me! I won't letnyou.\" \"Too bad sweetheart.\" \"Whyndon't you let me have a turn? You should put this kid in hernplace.\" \"I am about to do that Richard.\" Inwas afraid for the worst, Richard was a big guy. I don't mean that henwas fat but that he was bigger and muscular. He had well musclednshoulders and I knew that he at least been in fights before, he hadntatoos all over his arm and he was smirking at me. I knew that thingsnwere about to get worse than they already were before. Wherenwas Jan and why wasn't he here? Jan'snPOV Whyndid her mother show? Why now? Why in the hell didn't I bring her homenwith me? These were all questions running through my mind. I hopednher siblings weren't home, my mother was with me and I knew thatnafter this day things were about to change whether Sadie liked it ornnot. Bynthe time, we got to her house there were already three cop cars andnan ambulance parked in her driveway. Oh no, I hoped I wasn't toonlate. I got out of my mother's car and we walked up to the front, thendoor was open and two officers were standing out front. They werenboth pretty young looking, at least five years older than me. One ofnthem was writing a report and the other was talking to one of thenparamedics. \"Inwill take care of this Jan.\" Inwas worried about Sadie, I watched as my mother talked to the police.nThe door opened and I could see Sadie on a stretcher half asleep halfnawake, I made my way to her and I asked one of the paramedics if Incould talk to her and his only response was,\" Only a fewnsir.\" \"Sadie, what happened?\" She didn'tnsay anything for a few moments, I looked her over and her eye wasncovered with a bandage and she looked like she had been put throughnthe ringer. I was really begining to regret the way I treated her,nall those years that I was putting her through hell she was goingnthrough a hell of her own. \"I'mnso sorry Sadie.\" No response at all, I squeezed her handnuntil the paramedics took her in the bus and I felt like the biggestntool in the world. If something happened to her or she died, Inwouldn't be able to forgive myself. \"Jannsweetheart, I need to talk to you.\" \"Okay.\" Inwalked over to my mother who said,\" They are arresting hernmother and her boyfriend. They are being charged and they will mostnlikely go to court. I know the mother will. Did you talk tonsadie?\" \"She didn't answer me.\" Mynmother grimaced. \"Jan, she will make it out. I know she will, Inwant to be there when she wakes up. I called a friend of mine who isna social worker, her siblings will have to be placed in foster carenfor now.\" I grimaced wishing I would've taken her homenwith me, I wished I would done more before I left. Now, I felt guiltynthat I hadn't done more. Bynthe time we made it to the hospital, Les and Missy were there. I hadncalled them before I left. I was hoping that they know something butnfrom the looks of it, they didn't know anything at all. They didn'tnhave any news, I was fearing for the worst. \"HeynJan, Sadie's awake but she's not doing too well. She wants to seenyou.\" I brushed past Les and made my way to the NursesnStation at the Cedar Crest Memorial Hospital and asked,\" Wherenis Sadie Gilliam's room?\" The nurse looked up at me andnasked,\" Who are you?\" \"A friend ofnhers.\" \"She's in room 112.\" I smiled andnsaid,\" Thanks.\" I walked down the hall to her roomnand opened the door and quietly walked in, I saw Sadie lying on thenbed looking around the room. She was hooked up to a few tubes and Incould tell that she was having trouble breathing. Man, did I feelnawful? \"HinJan.\" I smiled as she rubbed her eye, I walked over tonher and knelt down and asked,\" Are you going to be okay?\" \"Inhope so.\" I smiled at and grabbed her hand and kissed hernfingers as she smiled and said,\" What's going to happennnow?\" \"Once you're well and better, my mom wants tontalk to you. Sadie, your siblings have been placed in protectivencustody until this is all overwith.\" \"Oh Jan, whatnam I going to do?\" \"Shhhh.\" I cupped hernface and said,\" It will be okay, I'm here now and I'm not goingnto leave you.\" She smiled and said,\" Can younhonestly believe this? We used to hate each other and now look atnus.\" She was right, it was strange. Sadie had literallynopened my eyes and flipped my life upside down but in a good way. Inwas lucky for someone like Sadie Gilliam, now all I had to do wasnmake her realize that she can live a happy life even with all that'snhappened to her. Inmade a promise to myself to do that.[Chapter 16] AunNote: Here is the next update, this is the beginning of a newnrelationship between Jan/Sadie. I hope you like this update. Bluehaven4220:nYes she is great and no that wasn't based on personal experience,nglad you like and hope you like this one as well. song:n\"I'll Believe In Anything\"-Wolf Parade, I don't own it. Sadie'snPOV Inwas lucky for Jan, I couldn't believe I was actually saying somethingnlike that but it was true. I was lucky for him, without him Inwould've probably ended up dead, I didn't know the extent of myninjuries but I knew they were serious. I was seeing his motherntomorrow, the doctors didn't think I was the shape to do that now. Incould feel Jan's fingers laced with mine and I didn't say a word, fornonce it felt nice and comforting that someone cared about me. Yes inknow it was Jan, the boy I hated for so many years. I rememberedneverything that went on between us, usually it was him making fun ofnme and how nerdy I was. \"Whatnare you thinking about Sadie?\" \"Hownstrange this is right now.\" Hensmiled. \"It is pretty strange, you taught me a lot sadie. A lotnthat I didn't think was possible, you changed me but in a good way. Inam lucky for someone like you Sadie, it is really weird that I amnsitting here telling you this. I wish I could take back all the stuffnI said or did to you, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I wish I couldntake it all back.\" Seeing the geniunousity in his voicenand his regretful expression, I grabbed his hand and said,\" Wenall make mistakes, you should happy that you were able to move pastnthat. Your so called friends will have a cruel reality check whennthey get into the real world.\" Thentwo of us were staring at each other for what seemed like eternitynuntil the door opened and one of the nurses walked in, I knew it wasntime for him to leave but I didn't want him to leave. \"Cannhe stay? Please.\" Jan shot me a look and I wasn't surenwhat it meant, the young woman looked at me and said,\" Mam, Incan't do that. He has to leave.\" \"Please, I wouldnreally like it if he stayed.\" She hesitated for a momentnbut then said,\" Ok, just this once.\" \"Ok, thanknyou.\" She walked out as Jan smiled at me and I laid backnon the pillow and closed my eyes, I felt Jan's lips on my foreheadnseconds later and he whispered,\" Goodnight Sadie.\" Inknew my life would be changing from this point on but I wasn't surenwhat would happen, I was anticipating that. Jan'snPOV Bynthe next morning, Sadie was feeling better but not well enough to gonhome. She had bruises and lacerations from her mother and hernboyfriend, I felt horrible for Sadie. I couldn't believe she had tongo through all this and with that same small smile on her face likeneverything was going to work out. I wouldn't be like that. I would benfalling apart but she was tougher, stronger, and could handle this. \"Jannsweetheart.\" I was startled to hear my mother's voice,nshe had just arrived along with the social worker who had put hernsiblings in foster care for now. I felt bad for them, they didn'tnhave a clue what was going on, they were far too young to fullynunderstand what was happening especially her younger sister but itnwas the right thing to do for now. \"Hinmom.\" Sadie was already awake and messing with her hair,nthe first I had ever seen her do that. She was using a hairbrush thatnmissy had brought to her to use. For the first time, I had seen hernmessing with her hair and wanting to make a good expression. \"Momnthis is Sadie. Sadie, this is my mom.\" She smiled andnsaid,\" Hi, it's nice to meet you Sadie.\" \"Likewise.\" Inexcused myself from the room knowing that they would want to be leftnalone and found Les out in the hallway, Missy wasn't with him so inwalked over there and he asked,\" What's up?\" \"Nothing,nthey are in there talking to Sadie.\" \"No, I meannwhat's going on in that head of yours.\" \"Lots ofnstuff Les.\" He smiled. \"So you see finally see whatnI mean about her life.\" I nodded. \"I do. I feel likenan asshole.\" \"You aren't the only that did, I wasnthe same way when I found out. I just hope we can convince her thatnthis is the right thing to do and she doesn't back out at the lastnminute.\" \"I hope you are right.\" \"Shenseems to like being around you which is a change of pace.\" Insnorted. \"You're telling me.\" \"It is strangenthough. You two used to hate each other.\" \"I know,nit's weird. We were talking about that last night.\" Inknew that things wouldn't be as easy as I thought they would be, Inknew that Sadie was getting help she needed but how would this affectnour relationship?[Chapter 17] Author'snNote: This is the new update, this is the beggining of a newnrelationship with Sadie/Jan.

Sadie'snPOV Thisnwas all too much, I couldn't believe this. My siblings were placed innthe Olive Crest Adoption Agency which was located in Santa Ana whichnwas an hour away from where I live right now and going to be placednin foster care when the time was right, I had come to the conclusionnthat they needed stable homes in a stable enviorment and I didn'tnknow if I could give them that. I just hoped they didn't hate me, Infelt like I was abanding them. \"Sadie?\" Inlooked up to see Jan standing by my door of the hospital room and henasked,\" Are you okay?\" \"I'm just thinking aboutnstuff.\" \"You did the right thing Sadie.\" \"Indon't my siblings to think that I abandoned them.\" Henwalked over and grabbed my hand and responded,\" Sadie, younaren't abandoning them. Why would you think that?\" Insighed. \"Jan, that's what my mother did to us. She walked out onnus and didn't want anything to do with us, how do you they are goingnto feel?\" I felt Jan's fingers on my cheeks as tearsnrolled down my cheek, he wiped it away and responded,\" Sadie,nthey won't think that. You can't keep doing this to yourself. You arendoing the right thing. Your brother and sister love you dearly and Indon't think they would ever think about you.\" \"Injust feel bad.\" \"Well don't feel bad Sadie.\" \"Well,nI do. I can't help it.\" Insighed. \"Sadie you are doing the right thing by filing chargesnagainst you're mother and putting your siblings in a stable and safenenviorment.\" \"Jan, is there any way they can stayntogether? That's what I want.\" \"I can talk to thensocial worker.\" \"Please,nthat's all I ask.\" He nodded. \"I will go donthat.\" \"Thank you Jan.\" For some reason,nthe tears didn't stop there. They kept falling and falling and Incouldn't stop crying, I felt Jan's fingers wipe my tears as I smilednand said,\" I'm sorry.\" \"Don't be sorry, you'rengoing through a lot lately and you are a strong person. A lotnstronger than me.\" I smiled. \"Thank you. I couldn'tnof done it without you. I appreciate all your help.\" Jannsmiled. \"It's not a problem, I was glad to help you out. We arenfriends now Sadie?\" \"I know we are.\" Itnfelt weird to say that, it was weird looking at Jan and seeing ancompletely different person than I saw before. He was so longerncrude, mean, selfish, and nasty but he was sweet, genuine, content,nand very helpful. I couldn't of gone this far without him, I knewnthat this was only the beginning, the next step was the trial and Inknew that was going to be harder than I thought. Jan'snPOV Sonthe trial was this week, mom was letting me miss a week from schoolnso I could be there for Sadie. I didn't even have to convince her tondo that, I knew Sadie would need all the support she could get. Shenwas doing better than the last couple days in the hospital but shenwould need time to recover. I was worried about her, I was morenworried about her emotional state than physical if that makes anynsense. Innthe past three weeks, I had learned more about myself than I evernthought possible and come to appreciate Sadie and not loathe her. Itnwas hard to imagine that this was happen but it did and for once Inwas glad that it did. I realized a lot about myself that I probablynwouldn't have realized. I now had a greater respect for someone likenSadie, she was working her butt off everyday and trying to make endsnmeet and raise her siblings. It wasn't her choice, it was somethingnshe had to do. I was making it harder for her by making fun of hernand teasing her from the day I met in preschool until now, I wasnashamed of myself for that. I promised to become a better person andnhelp Sadie, I made a promise to do that. \"Arenyou going back to school tomorrow?\" \"No, I'm goingnto help you.\" She smiled. \"You don't have to donthat.\" \"I know but I want to.\" Shensmiled. \"I'm lucky for you.\" I wiped her brown hairnout of her eyes and noticed how beautiful her blue eyes were, theynsparkled when she smiled and I never noticed that before. I nevernnoticed a lot of things about Sadie until I got to know her, she wasna great person but most anyone looked at it is how she dressed andnhow nerdy she was. She always wore worn out jeans and t-shirts tonschools, her worn out blue chuck taylors and zip ups and hoodies. Shenalways wore the same black rimmed glasses and people were constantlynmaking fun of her. I felt bad that I was one of them. Inwiped her eyes as she smiled at me and said,\" I bet this isn'tnhow you want to spend your days.\" \"Doesn't matternSadie, I feel better now that you are getting better.\" Shensmiled at me and repsonded,\" What happened to the old Jan?\" Inchuckled. \"He's gone forever.\" \"I like the newnJan.\" \"Indo too. I hope it stays this way.\"[Chapter 18] Author'snNote: yes, another chapter of my jan story. This chapter is mainlynfrom Sadie's POV. read and review! Saarah:nthank you so much!

I don't own it. Sadie'snPOV \"Yesnwe all know it's better that yesterday has passed, now lets startingnliving for the one's that going to last.\" Anfew days had passed since the incident, I was now sitting at homenpreparing for the trial. It was going to start tomorrow and I wasnmore than nervous, I was scared. I knew that I would see my motherntomorrow but mostly importantly that this was the beginning of a newnpart of my life. \"Sadie,nwhy are you leaving us?\" I was startled to hear my littlensister's voice and I smiled and said,\" Come here.\" Carmennwalked in and curled up in my lap and I said,\" Sweetie, I'm notnleaving you. I love you so much and I always will, you are going tonbe in a better enviorment. I am not well enough to take care of younand give you the things you need.\" \"But...buuuut inwanna be with you.\" My face fell hearing my sisternsobbing loudly, the two of them were home and I was trying to getntheir things ready. They had been placed in a foster home, I hadn'tnmet the parents yet but from the sounds of it they were a nice andnloving family that would give my siblings the care they needed that Incouldn't give them. \"Sweetie,nI know you are too young to understand but I can't give that to you.nI'm not well and I have to take care of myself and I will come visitnyou three times a week and you are going to love your new home, Inpromise. I love you both so much and I can't give you what younneed.\" \"Sadie?\" I was surprised andnstartled to see Jan standing in the doorway, I didn't know he wasncoming over. I had planned on spending the day helping my siblingsnpack up their stuff, my brother was angry with me and I knew that henwould be. I was working on coping with that as well, I didn't neednthe him over here. I appreciated the help but I wanted to do this bynmyself. \"Indidn't know you three would be here.\" \"I tried toncall you but you didn't answer.\" \"Oh,nI was busy.\" \"Insee that.\" Carmen was still sitting in my lap pouting nonless, he looked at me and I mouthed,\" She's been like this allnday.\" He bent down as my sister looked up at him andnsaid,\" She's weaving us.\" \"Hey, she's notnleaving you. Carmen, she will never leave you. You are going to livenwith a nice and loving family, sadie can't give you what you need.nShe's not well and she needs to get better but she will still be anpart of your life.\" Fornthe first time in a last couple weeks, I smiled at him as my youngernsister looked up at me and said,\" Will you visit me?\" \"Ofncourse I will sweetie pie.\" Carmen hugged me as Inmouthed,\" Thank you.\" He smiled as Carmen got upnfrom my lap and went into her room, I was still sitting on the floornwhen Jan came in and seated himself on the chair near my desk and henasked,\" How's your brother taking it?\" \"Henhates me.\" \"Sadie, you are going the rightnthing.\" \"That's what I keep telling myself. He's innhis room, he won't come out and talk to me. I feel so helpless Jan,nhe thinks I'm abandoning him.\" \"You aren't Sadie,nwould it help if I talk to him?\" \"I'm willing tontrying anything at this point.\" He smiled. \"I'll gondo that.\" \"Thank you.\" It was hard tonbelieve that this was happening, the life I knew and had been livingnwas falling apart and I didn't know what I was going to do after thentrial, I wasn't sure I could live in this house. There were so manynmemories, some good but most of the bad. I was still reeling from thenbeating I got, the memories from that wouldn't go away and I knewnthey never would. \"Sadie?nCan you help me?\" \"Sure sweetie.\" I gotnup from my spot and picked my little sister up as she smiled andnsaid,\" I love you Sadie.\" \"I love you too.\" Incould hear Jan and my brother talking in his room, I hoped that whatnJan was saying was helping my brother and not making him angier withnme. I didn't want that at all. Aboutnan hour later, I could hear the door open and my brother and Jannwalked in Carmen's room. I was helping her pack up, most of theirnstuff was already packed up and ready to go. It was going to be sonhard to say goodbye to them, very hard. \"Hinbuddy.\" \"Hi Sadie, I'm sorry.\" I smiled.n\"I'm not mad at you.\" Jan ruffled his hair as Insmiled and mouthed,\" Thank you so much.\" Inwas so busy helping my younger sister I didn't realize what time itnwas, it was close to nine and I knew Carmen was getting tired,ntomorrow they were going to began living with their foster parentsnand I knew that this was going to be a tough goodbye. Goodbyes arennever easy. \"I'mntired Sadie.\" \"I know you are sweetheart, you wantnto go to bed?\" She nodded as Jan smiled and said,\"nI'll help you out Sadie.\" \"Youndon't have to Jan, you can go home now.\" \"No, I wantnto help you Sadie. I don't mind.\" I didn't say anythingnbut nod to him, it was hard to believe that this was Jan. It wasnweird, I was still coming to terms with all of this and I was findingnit hard to believe that we were friends. Strangenhow life works out that way? You end up hanging out and being friendsnwith the one person you hated? I wondered what was in store with menand Jan. Hopefully it wouldn't be as complicated as my life is now.[Chapter 19] Author'snNote: so sorry for the long wait, here is the next update.

Song:nLyrics from \"Young Folks\"-Peter Bjorn and John. I don't ownnit. Sadie'snPOV So,ntoday is the big day. The trial, I was a nervous wreck. I had beenncrying most of the last night, I couldn't believe the day was here.nWell, I could but it was still hard to imagine. I knew I would havento testify against my mother and I was not looking forward to that. \"Sadie?\" Inwas startled to hear Jan's voice and then I remembered that he wouldnbe here, it was first day of the trial and he would be in thencourtroom. \"HinJan, why are you here so early?\" \"I came with mynmother, she's going to be prosequting the case remember?\" Innodded. \"I do.\" \"You will be okay Sadie, youncan get through this.\" \"I hope you arenright.\" Suddenly, I happened to see my mother and hernattourney and I wanted to hide. She was too busy to notice me, hernattourney was talking to her assuring that they would win. I hopednand prayed that they wouldn't. I felt Jan's hand on my arm as mynmother passed me not bothering to look at me. This wasn't going to beneasy. AsnI made my way into the courtroom with Jan, I could hear my motherntalking to the attourney and saying how ridculous this trial was andnthat she didn't do anything, I was so mad at her. She did plentynwrong to me and I couldn't hold my temper, I looked at her andnyelled,\" You did plenty to us! Don't act like you didn't, Incan't believe I held this in for this long.\" Jan grabbednme and led me away from everyone and rubbed my arms and responded,\"nSadie, you have to control your temper. I know you are upset but thatnwon't do you any good.\" I knew he was right, it was hardnto imagine me thinking that he was right but he was. There was nonreason for me to get upset, it wasn't going to do me any good expectnfeeling more upset. \"Sadie?\" Thentwo of us looked to see his mother looking at us, she smiled andnsaid,\" It's time for the trial to being, Saide I'm not surenwhether you will be up on the stand today.\" I nodded asnthe two of us were lead into the courtroom and we were seated behindnthe prosecution, I didn't look at my mother or her attourney. Indidn't want to look at them, not today and not ever. Thenday started with opening arguments and I was ready for what thendefensive would say. I anticipated it but I knew that my day on thenstand wouldn't come today but maybe tomorrow, at least I hoped. Basically,nI was in a whirlwind of emotions. I felt happy and content that I wasnmoving on but sad and upset that it to end up like this. I hadn'tnlived the happiest life but if there was one thing I was glad for itnwas Jan. He was there for me through all of this and I was lucky tonhave a friend like him. Bynthe end of the day, I was exhausted, drained, upset, and worn out. Mynday would come tomorrow and I was more scared than anything that Inhave ever felt. Inwould have to tesitify against the one person I didn't want to see,nmy mother.[Chapter 20] AunNote: This is still the trial, the next chapter will end with it. Inhope you enjoy! Bluehaven4220:nhere you go:) Jan'snPOV AsnI watched Sadie, I heard my mother speak up,\" I would like toncall my first witness to the crime, Sadie Gilliam.\" Inrubbed Sadie's arm as she stood up and made her way to the stand, shendidn't look at her mother but nodded to mine and walked up the standnand sat down as the police officer read her the rights as theynusually do then my mother asked,\" Please state your full namenfor the courtroom.\" \"Sadie AlexandrianGilliam.\" That was the first time I had heard her middlenname, I thought it was beautiful. I smiled at her as my mothernasked,\" Sadie, how old are you?\" \"Eighteen.\" \"Whatndo you do other than going to school?\" \"Inwork two jobs and try to take care of my siblings.\" Shensmiled as my mother asked,\" Does your mother ever comenaround?\" \"Only when she wants something from me,nusually she comes around with a new guy and all she does is yell andnscream at me or my siblings.\" \"What does shensay?\" \"She tells me how stupid I am, how dumb I amnto believe that I will make something of myself. My father died whennI was young and she's always been like this, she drinks too much thatnshe's ruined any relationship with her family. She's hated us sincenday one, she's never around so I took responsiblity when I was youngnto take care of my siblings.\" My mother nodded as thenquestioning continued as I got prepared for the defense attourney andnI knew he was going to try and corner Sadie and I hope she didn'tnback down from it. She needed to win this. Nownit was the defense's turn, the young man looked at Sadie and asked,\"nSo Sadie, why didn't you tell anyone about this until now?\" \"Inwas afraid, I didn't think anyone would believe me.\" \"Whynshould be we believe you now?\" \"Whynwould I lie about it now? I was afraid and I was young and I didn'tnknow what to do. I wouldn't lie and I won't sit up here and let younaccuse me of lying.\" \"But why should we?\" NownSadie was beginning to fall apart, I had enough. This guy was angenuine asshole who desereve to be kicked out. I could tell the judgenwas getting a little annoyed, he looked her mom's defense attourneynand responded,\" Mr. Adams, please get to the point and quitnbadgering the witness.\" Sadie calmed down only to benslammed again when he asked,\" Why didn't you ever reportnit?\" \"Because I was afraid!!!! I was young and Indidn't know what to do!\" I stood up and yelled,\"nCome on, that isn't fair!!!\" \"Sir, you have to sitndown or I will kick you out of the courtroom.\" The roomnerupted with shouts and yelling, my mother shot a look back at me asnI slumped down in my seat. Sadie was crying on the stand, the roomnwas in total destruction. Sadie wiped her eyes as everyone began tonquiet down and the defense council continued his questions evennthough they were completely ludacris but I gained more respect fornSadie. She stayed tough and was able to answer the questions, shenremained up there for most of the day. I could tell she was exhaustednwhile up on the stand but she remained calm for most of thenquestioning. WhilenI was sitting there watching her, I began to notice how beautifulnSadie was when she had her down and when she was determined. I nevernnoticed this before, like I said I've never noticed a lot of thingsnbut she was very pretty. Her hair was pulled back with a blacknheadband, the weird thing was that this was the first time I had seennher with her hair down. Usually, it was up in a ponytail but today itnwas different. Sadie was different, I was beginning to realize what Infool I was for making her life a living hell. Seeing this and whatnshe went through made me realize how hard she has had it while I'venbeen living the easy life. Incaught her eye as she waited for the trial to end and something toldnme that she was beginning to feel the same way about me. There wasnthis look on her eye that was telling me how much she needed me and Inwasn't about to leave her.[Chapter 21] AunNote: Here is more to the story, I do hope you enjoy this update. Bluehaven4220:nyes he is a good boy! Glad you like. :) hsmprincess:nthank you for the review! I hope you enjoy this update! Jan'snPOV \"Sadie?\" \"HinJan, I was just coming by to thank you.\" Inblushed. \"For what?\" She smiled back at me as Inopened the door and walked out to meet her as she smiled and said,\"nI want to thank you for being there for me, I don't know if I couldnhave done it without you Jan. Thank you.\" I looked at hernand brushed her brown hair out of her eyes as she smiled at me and Insaw a new light in her eyes, she was happy and healthy and that'snwhat I wanted. A happy Sadie. I leaned down and brushed my lipsnagainst her cheek as she smiled and kissed me on the cheek as I movednmy lips to hers and wrapped my arms around her as she smiled at menand said,\" You have changed Jan, I like the new you.\" \"Younknow I do.\" The two of us were in a trance until I brokenit and leaned down and kissed her as she whimpered, her lips werensoft and warm as I cupped her cheek in my hands as I kissed her, Incouldn't believe this was happening to me. I was absolutly in lovenwith Sadie Giiliam. Suddenly,nI shot up in bed trying to think about my dream which was weird. Itnhad been a couple of days since Sadie had been on the stand and I hadnbeen having these dreams lately about Sadie, weird dreams about hernmainly of me telling her that I was in love with her. I laid down innbed running my fingers through my hair trying to work everything out,nmy life had literally turned inside out because of Sadie. Anlot had changed for me, I haven't spoken to my so called friends in anfew weeks since everything happened. I guess you could say that I hadnchanged but it was hard to imagine me having dreams about tellingnSadie that I loved her, I hadn't noticed a lot of things about Sadie. Itnwas hard to imagine that just one person can totally change yournlife, the way you think, the way you are, the way you act andneverything that you thought you knew was a lie. It was strange tonthink how my life changed in one split second, I was more anxiousnthan anything in the world to see how this trail panned out. Mostlynimportant how Sadie was going to take it. Sadie'snPOV Inwish it was over, I wish none of this had happened. Everything was sonmuch easier for me and now it had changed and now things were muchnmore difficult. My siblings were in foster care, I was a mess, and mynmother wanted to kill me so life was just real peachy. It had been ancouple days since I was put on the stand and I was just glad it wasnover, I hated being on the stand but knew I had to do it. I leaningntowards the hope that she would be lose custody of us and that's allnI wanted. The charges against her were child negligence and childnabuse among others, Jan's mom told that she would possibly get ten tonfifteen years and that made me relieved. Inwas just ready for this to be over. Thennext day... AsnI arrived to the courtroom, I noticed that Jan and his mother werentalking quietly and he was trying to get information out of her. Inknew something was going but I didn't know what it was. As I made mynway over to them, I saw Jan smile at me and I knew something was upnso I asked,\" Is something wrong?\" He smiled at me.n\"Your mom fired her attourney, she doesn't want anyone tonrepresent her. She wants to do it alone.\" \"What?\" Suddenly,nI felt weak and I felt like I was going to pass out. I don't know whynbut I felt sick to my stomach and Jan must have noticed because hengrabbed me and I fell into his arms struggling to breathe, I closednmy eyes as he brought me in the courthouse. I don't why this wasnhappening to me, I should be glad to hear this. Now I knew that thisnday in the courtroom was going to be emotional and I wasn't sure Incould handle it. Inwasn't sure about anything anymore.[Chapter 22] Author'snNote: Hello, here is the next chapter. If you can believe it, therenactually isn't much more to the story left only a few chapters andnthen eplilouge and then I'm done. I have another story that I amnplanning to post but it's not another bring it on story. I have beennwriting it for the past couple months but wanted to wait until Infinish one of my stories to post it. I do hope you enjoy thisnchapter, please read and review! Bluehaven4220:nyou will see them together very very soon, i'm glad you like themntogether. Hope you like this update. hsmprincess:nWell, it actually doesn't put her in a bad position but after thentrial is over things will start looking up for Sadie. Jan'snPOV Inheld Sadie in my arms as my mother handed her a glass of water, Sadienwas in shock and feeling low. I felt bad for her, I knew this wouldnbe a huge blow to her and I wasn't sure how she would handle it. \"Arenyou going to be okay?\" \"I don't think I can gonin.\" His mom, Jane grimaced and said,\" Sweetie, Inknow this is upsetting for you. It would be for anyone in thisnsituation but you did so well on the stand and I know you can donthis.\" Inrubbed Sadie's arm as she smiled at me, I felt terrible for Sadie. Injust hoped she wouldn't take this out on herself. I didn't want thatnto happen to her but that is what I feared. \"DonI have no to testify today?\" \"Nope, today is goingnto be closing arguments and then the judge will decide what tondo.\" Sadie nodded. \"I'll go in.\" Shensmiled as I helped her up and the two of us walked in the courtroomnwhich was packed, she didn't even look at the defense table because Inknew how much pain she was going through. I had my arms around Sadienfor most of the day, she didn't seem to mind. A few times she wouldnbury her face into my shoulder and I didn't mind at all, in fact Inliked it. I knew that her mother was going to lose horribly, shenwasn't even prepared and my mother was going to make sure thatnSadie's mom didn't see the light of day for a long time. Wenlistened as the judge gave his speech and we knew it was turning innour favor, he was lecturing her mother and we listened to what he hadnto say which wasn't pleasent. I watched as he gave her mother thenharshest sentence that he could give, ten to fifteen years to childnabuse and negliance among other things. I saw Sadie breathe a sigh ofnrelief as her mother was taken away, I hugged Sadie as she smiled andnburied her face in my shoulder. It was a big relief for all of us. \"Sonshe's going to prison?\" I nodded. \"For a very longntime.\" I didn't know what she was thinking but I knewnthat she was upset and her feelings were all mixed up, hell I knownmine would be too. Sadie had been through a lot in the past few weeksnso I knew that she wouldn't express how she was feeling at thenmoment but from the looks of it she looked relieved but she alsonlooked worn out and exhausted. \"Sadie,nare you going to be okay?\" \"I don't know.\" Inrubbed her shoulder as she leaned on me and I helped her get up fromnthe bench, I walked her out as she buried her face into my chest andnstarted to cry as I ruffled her hair as she clung to me and sobbednand I ran my fingers through her hair letting her cry it out. I feltnterrible for sadie, this had to take a toll on her and I knew thatnshe was feeling stressed out, anyone in her situation would be. \"Shhhh,nit will be okay Sadie.\" \"Nonit's not.\" \"Oh jan, I've made a mistake by doingnthis.\" I cupped her cheek and said,\" Sadie, no younhaven't. You did the right thing.\" \"Then how come Indon't feel like it.\" As I drove her home in her car, Ingrabbed her hand as she looked at me and said,\" I still feel badnabout my siblings, I put them in foster care and now look atnme.\" \"Sadie, you didn't do anything wrong. In fact,nyou did everything right in finding the help that you need. Yournsiblings are in better care now, don't take this out onnyourself.\" \"Jan, it's my fault. I should've takennbetter care of them.\" Seeing that this was only makingnher upset, I looked at her and said,' Sadie, I'm not trying to tellnyou what you do but you can't do this yourself. You are only makingnyourself upset, you did the right thing. Anyone will tell you that.nDon't do this to yourself.\" \"But Jan.\" \"Nonbuts about it.\" I looked at her as she intwined her handnin mine as I smiled at her and said,\" Don't do this to yourself,nI don't like to see you do this to yourself.\" \"Cannyou stay with me?\" I nodded. \"I will stay with younhowever long you need me.\" I knew Sadie was going throughna lot and not showing her emotions but I was also going through anlot, throughout the last couple weeks I became more in touch with mynfeelings and realizing that I did feel something for Saide, I justnwanted her to be okay.[Chapter 23] AunNote: I decided not use the orginal idea I had for this part of thenstory but I have something else in mind, I do hope you enjoy. :) song:n\"I Could Be There For You-Eisley. I don't own it. Sadie'snPOV AsnI laid with Jan on my bed, I could feel his arms wrapped around menand his fingers stroking my forehead and I liked that feeling. I'dnnever felt it before and it was nice and soothing, lately I had beennso wrapped up in what had been going that I hadn't thought about mynrelationship with Jan which was changing rapidly, I had noticed thatnhe changed a lot since everything that happened between us and innthat change, I actually had grown a little crush on him. He was lessnselfish and more helpful, I liked that about him. \"Jan,nwhy are you doing this?\" \"Because I care.\" Inhid my face in his shoulder so he couldn't see my face, I felt hisnfingers run through my hair as I smiled when he kissed my foreheadnand he asked,\" Are you going to be okay?\" \"Indon't know.\" I felt his fingers brush my forehead and Inshivered as he asked,\" What did I do?\" \"I'vennever been touched like that before.\" \"You mean,nyou've never had a boyfriend?\" I blushed. \"Jan, I'vennever been kissed, hugged, held, or cuddled with anyone.\" Inleaned back to where he was looking at me as I smiled back at him asnhe stroked my cheek and I shivered as he brushed his lips againstnmine and I wrapped my arms around his waist as I felt his lips pressnagainst mine, I felt his fingers brush against my cheek and I havennever felt like this before, being with Jan was something that Innever imagined. \"Jaaaan.\" Henbroke apart and blushed as I stroked his cheek and he asked,\"nWas I going to fast?\" \"No, you weren't. I've neverndone that before so it's all new to me.\" \"I know itnis Sadie. I'm not exactly the stud everyone thinks I am.\" \"Whatndo you mean?\" He sighed as I linked my arm through hisnand leaned on him and he said,\" Sadie, I'm not all thatnconfident when it comes to woman especially after what Big Red did tonme. We dated for awhile but she was using me and I felt like an idiotnand instead of letting my feelings show I hid them and I put my angerntowards making fun of you.\" I sat there not knowing whatnto say as he continued,\" Sadie, everyone thinks I'm so confidentnand I have it all going for me but I don't. I'm rich and wealthy butnnot exactly happy, I've always felt like something is missing from mynlife but thought once I get to college I'll find it. When you told menoff I realized that I needed to change and I also realized that thenlife I was livng wasn't making me happy.\" I intwined mynfingers with his as he continued and said,\" If you could believenit, I'm much happier than before. I acted like I was but I trulynwasn't.\" \"No one is perfect Jan.\" Henturned to look at me as I cupped his face as he nuzzled my cheek andnI smiled and wrapped my arms around him as he whispered,\" I'mnsorry Sadie for everything I've done to you.\" He kissednmy forehead as I smiled and he asked,\" Are you going to benokay?\" \"I think I will be but I'd appreciate it ifnyou would stay over with me.\" Henkissed my forehead as I looked at him and said,\" Is this reallynhappening?\" He chuckled. \"It is but only if you wantnit to happen Sadie. I know I feel something for you but I don't wantnto push you into anything that you don't want to.\" Inwasn't exactly sure what to say but Jan did it for me, he leaned innand brushed his lips against my cheek, I really liked the feeling ofnbeing in jan's arms. I was no longer afraid of him but knew I couldnlonger be without him. Jan'snPOV Inlooked at Sadie as she laid in my arms and my crush on her wasngrowing at the moment, like I had said in the past I never noticednhow beautiful she was. Yes, she was a pretty normal looking averagengirl but I never noticed how her blue eyes shined and how her smileninstantly made you feel better. My life had literally changed, I wentnfrom making fun and critizing Sadie Gilliam to falling in love withnher. Weird, how life works out. \"Whatnare you thinking about Jan?\" \"How weird lifenis.\" She giggled as I kissed her forehead as she smilednand said,\" I was thinking about us last night.\" Inlooked at her and asked,\" Really?\" She nodded. \"It'snalmost the end of the semester and now look at us, what's going tonhappen to us?\" I kissed her forehead and said,\" Inwant to be with you Sadie and help you. I care about you.\" \"Inknow you do, I care about you too.\" As we laid on her bednand talked about the last couple months and our feelings, I knew Inwas doing a good thing by helping and being there for Sadie. I didn'tncare what anyone thought of me, I was tired of being that way. I amnwho am I am like Sadie had taught me, she had taught more than I evernthought I would find out.

Sadie'snPOV Sondo I have a boyfriend now or what? This was all so weird but at thensame time, I loved the thought of having a boyfriend. I'd never hadnone before and now I had one, tonight was weird. I could hear Jan'snsoft breathing as he lay next to me, I looked at him as he slept andnhe was so adorable when he slept, his hair was in his eyes and hisnlips were crinkled into a small smile. I never thought it would gonthis far, I just thought he would become a good friend to me but notnanything more than that. Butnwhat he would with a girl like me? I'm not pretty, funny, or anythingnlike the girls he used to date. \"Jan?\" AllnI heard was a mumur from him as I shook him again and he rubbed hisneyes and looked at me and asked,\" Sadie? Are you okay?\" \"Inwas just thinking.\" He wrapped his arms around me andnasked,\" What about?\" \"Us.\" \"Whatnabout us Sadie? Are you having second thoughts?\" \"No,nnot about that but just why would you want to be with a girl like me?nI'm not pretty like most of the girls you used to date.\" \"Sadie.\" Hencuppped my cheek as I smiled at him and he responded,\" Sadie, Inlike you for you. Most the girls I used to date are airheads but younaren't. You're beautiful, intelligent, funny, caring and you use yournhead instead of saying something stupid just to make you look good. Inlike what's on the inside as well as what's on the outside.\" Insmiled as he leaned in and kissed me as I whimpered and curled up innhis arms, he kissed me softly as I wrapped my arms around him, Jan'snfingers brushed against my cheek moving slowly down my cheek and Insighed when his hand drifted under my shirt and began rubbing my backnas I buried my face into his chest as he kissed me harder and hencupped my face in his hands and soon the two of us were in anpassionate embrace that none of us wanted to break, I bit my lip as Infelt his hand rubbing my back and I didn't move, I liked the feelingnbut I had to wonder what would happen when we got back to school. Jan'snPOV \"Arenyou coming to school tomorrow Sadie? If you want, I could pick younup.\" \"I'm coming tomorrow and I think I will benfine.\" He smiled. \"You are making a good choice withnthis Sadie, I promise I won't hurt you.\" \"I know jannbut this is all new for me.\" I cupped her cheek as shensmiled at me and rested her hands on my chest, I kissed her nose andnsaid,\" Everything will be fine, trust me Sadie.\" Inknew that this would a new sort of test for Sadie but I knew we couldndo it, I just hoped Sadie would see that and not stress herself out. Shenwasn't moving and I could hear her soft breathing and I knew she wasnasleep, I watched her sleep and there was something about her whennshe was sleeping that made my heart flutter. I never imagined thatnlife would turn out this way but I was happier that it did. Thennext day... AsnI walked up to the school trying to look for Sadie, I finally noticednher huddled against the school building arms folded across her chestnand it looked like she had been crying, great what happenednnow? \"Sadie?\" \"I need to gonhome.\" \"Why?\" She wiped her eyes. \"Incan't take it here anymore. Everyone has been talking about me, thentrial and everything. I ran into Carter who pushed me and my booksnspilled all over the place.\" I pulled her into my armsnand wiped her eyes and said,\" Don't listen to him, he's a stupidnjerk. I know it's hard Sadie but don't listen to any of them.\" \"Theynare talking about you too.\" \"I don't care.\" \"Arenyou sure you want to be seen with me?\" I cupped her facenand kissed her forehead and said,\" How many times do I have tontell you that I am smitten with you and I don't care what anyonenthinks.\" She smiled and I knew this wasn't going to beneasy like I had hoped, now I had to worry about something happeningnto Sadie at school. She didn't need that.[Chapter 25] AunNote: Another update for you, the next will be more frequent. I donhope you enjoy, please read and review. Bluehaven4220:nyes i know they are adorable:) Jan'snPOV AsnI stood on the field during the football game, I looked into thenstands to see Sadie eating a hot dog and I chuckled when as she soonnas she ate it the mustard and ketchup spilled all over shirt. Shengrabbed the napkins and wiped her shirt off and looked up knowingnthat I smiling at her and she rolled her eyes at me just as Lesnleaned over and asked,\" Wanna tell me what's going on betweennyou two?\" I hadn't had the time to tell Les or anyonenelse for that matter about Sadie being my girlfriend, we hadn't toldnanyone but now I was going to tell Les because I knew he wasn't goingnto let up on me. \"Ohnyeah, I hadn't found the time to tell you that we are a couple.\" Hisneyes grew wide and I asked,\" What's wrong?\" \"JesusnJan, one day you go from hating Sadie to now saying she's yourngirlfriend.\" \"She is, even ask her. We haven't beenntogether for that long but I'm happy with her. I know it's weird tonsee knowing that I grew up hating the girl but she changed menLes.\" \"You can say that.\" \"Inhaven't talked to Sadie in a few days, last time I talked to her wasnthe day after she went on the stand. How is she doing?\" \"Whyndon't you ask her after the game?\" He nodded. \"Inwill do that but don't hurt her Jan, that's all I ask.\" \"Inwouldn't dare hurt her.\" First day back to school for menand Sadie had been a test, we were constantly hearing people whispernthings but we didn't do or say anything about it. They could talk allnthey want, nothing was going to keep from being with sadie. We satntogether during lunch and she talked about looking at colleges innCalifornia which made me happy, I knew why she was looking out ofnstate. It was to get out of California as fast as she could and Incouldn't blame her but now that all of her troubles were over, shenwas concentrating on staying here and finishing her school year. Inwas planning on asking her about USC, I was going to USC and we wouldnbe close to one another. That's what I wanted. Thengame was no over and I watched Sadie as she got up from the bleachersnand watched as her brown hair fell in her eyes until Missy elbowed menin the arm and I rolled my eyes as she asked,\" So I hear you andnSadie are a couple?\" I nodded. \"Yes wenare.\" \"Interesting Jan, when did this happen?\" \"Anfew nights ago, I know what you are going to say but I know what I'mndoing and I didn't force her to do anything with me.\" \"Whonsaid you did?\" \"No one.\" \"So whatnmade this come about?\" \"A lot of things Missy.\" \"Insee. We might be going to Nationals in Flordia.\" \"Really?\" \"Yep,nwe might be going but we aren't sure yet. Not much has happened sincenyou left but Big Red came by and heard about you being withnSadie.\" \"What'd she say?\" \"Justnpoking fun of you.\" I shook my head as Missy shrugged andnresponded,\" You are doing a good thing by being there for Sadie.nDon't listen to anyone else.\" She walked off to thenlockerroom as I walked into our and decided to change into my streetnclothes, I didn't know what I was doing with Sadie afterwards. Shenlooked worn out and tired so I didn't think we would doing much butnas long as I got spend time with her than I was good to go. Sadie'snPOV \"HinLes.\" He smiled and asked,\" So you wanna tell menabout you and Jan?\" I blushed. \"I thought younknew.\" \"Nope, he just told me a little whilenago.\" \"I really like him Les, he's changed.

Just leavenme alone, I know what I'm doing and just because you don't like Jannand you think he hasn't changed there's no reason for you to tell menwhat to do.\" \"What's going on?\" We bothnlooked to see Jan standing there car keys in hand looking at the twonof us, I was about ready to slap Les. I didn't know why he was makingnsuch a big deal out of this, I was ready for this. \"It'snnothing Jan, see ya later.\" I was still upset even whennJan kissed my head and he asked,\" What's wrong?\" \"Hendoesn't think I'm ready for something like this.\" \"Why?\" \"Indon't know.\" Jan intwined his fingers with my hand as Inleaned on him and said,\" i am ready for something like this, Inknow I am.\" He kissed my head and said,\" Maybe itnwill take some time getting used to Sadie.\" \"I hopenso.

I was falling hardernfor Sadie as the moments passed, I found that sometimes hard tonbelieve. Sadie'snPOV Mynheart was still racing as I climbed into the front seat of Jan's car,nI'd never felt like this before. No one had touched me like that, Inliked the feeling of his cold hand running up my chest and rubbing mynbelly. I was falling harder for Jan, he was handsome, funny, sweet,nand everything that I needed. Inwas looking forward to spending the day with him and I wanted to benwith him, not in the sexual sense. It's way to early to start talkingnabout that but in the emotional and physical sense, the more time Inspent with Jan the more I was finding myself in love with him. \"Arenyou okay Sadie?\" I smiled. \"I'm fine, I've neverndone anything like that.\" He turned to look at me as henparked the car in front of my house and asked,\" Did I donsomething wrong?\" \"No, you didn't.

I justnthought it would be fun and I haven't seen Roger in awhile.\" Insmiled. \"Then, lets do that.\" \"Are younsure?\" I nodded knowing that I would be in good hands, Inknew Jan wouldn't let anything happen to me. I trusted him with mynheart and soul. Jannsmiled and kissed my head, it was a beautiful day but a bit chilly.nJan held my hand as we walked through San Diego, just being in hisncompany made me happy. I no longer felt scared or unsure, well I didna little bit but I knew I would get over that feeling and it would gonaway. \"Mynbirthday is coming up jan.\" \"Is it?\" Innodded. \"It's November 19th.\" \"I will have tondo somethign special for you.\" I smiled. \"You arentoo sweet. What happened to the old Jan?\" He leaned overnand said,\" He's gone forever.\" I smiled as I enjoyednspending my day with Jan, we walked through out San Diego checkingnout everything and I had so much fun with him. Now, we were headednover to USC for this party that he wanted to take me to. He smilednand hugged me as I kissed him and wrapped my arms around him and hennuzzled my cheek and said,\" When you want to go, just let menknow.\" \"I will.\" I held his hand as wenwalked into the packed house, it wasn't like I thought it would be.

It had to be, this placed was packed. Henheld me close as Roger asked,\" Sadie, do you want a beer?\" \"No,nI'm fine.\" \"You sure?\" I nodded. \"I'llnbe good.\" Throughtoutnthe night, I stayed with Jan for the most of the night but I wasnhaving a good time. I never thought I would have a good time but Indid, it's not like I was admitting that I was going to party non stopnbut I had fun. \"Are you having fun Sadie?\" Insmiled as Jan nuzzled my cheek and I asked,\" Are you having angood time?\" He nodded. \"I am but I am just morenhappy that you are. I heard you talked to Roger about his major.\" \"Indid, I may have to check out the communcations program here at USC.\" Hensmiled and I knew that made him happy, he was going to USC. It was antradition in his family, his dad went and so did his grandfather andnso on. I knew from prior conversations with Jan he wasn't actuallynsure what he wanted to do. Throughoutnthe night, I stayed with Jan until the two of were alone in the poolnroom. Usually, it was packed on this night it was empty. Jan brushednhis lips against mine as I smiled and he kissed me softly as I sat innhis arms for a few minutes until his tongue brushed against mine lipsnand I opened my mouth but held on to him tighter as we kissed eachnother. I entangled my fingers in his hair as he kissed me harder, Insank into his arms as he caressed my side and I liked this feeling. Infelt Jan's fingers caress my cheeks as I kissed him as he moved hisnlips to my neck as I whimpered and he stopped and looked at me and Inwrapped my arms around him and kissed him back as he shifted hisnweight so he was now sitting next to me but we were still close, Insmiled as Jan moved his lips to my neck but I whimpered when I feltnhis fingers unbutton my pants and I closed my eyes as he kissed menand whispered,\" Do you want me to stop? I will Sadie.\" Inshook my head. \"Nope.\" \"Are you sure?\" Innodded as he kissed me and I whimpered louder than before, I'd neverndone anything like this before. This was all new to me but for somenreason it didn't scare me. Well it did a little bit but I reallynenjoyed it. Inopened my eyes as Jan kissed me and he opened his mouth as I wrappednmy arms around his waist and he continued moving his hand as I buriednmy face into his neck and he whispered,\" Sadie, do you want mento quit?\" I shook my head as he continued until I gaspednand whimpered,\" Jaaaaaan.\" He took his hand out andnkissed me softly until I calmed down, that was the most incrediblenthing I've ever done in my entire life. Jannsmiled and kissed me as I looked at him and whispered,\" Yournamazing.\" He leaned down and pecked me on the cheek as Inleaned over and nuzzled his cheek and he whispered,\" I happen tonthink you are even more amazing sadie.\" He brushed hisnlips against mine as I smiled and thought how drastically things hadnchanged for me but was I actually making the right choice? Was thisngoing too fast or was I overreacting? I only had to wonder.[Chapter 28] AunNote: Hello, here is the next update and it's a little short. I donhope you enjoy! Please read and review! Bluehaven4220:nyou will see how Sadie reacts in this chapter! Jan'snPOV Inwas still in a tight embrace with Sadie when she looked at me andnasked,\" Have you ever done that with anyone else?\" Inshook my head. \"Sadie, like I told you before I'm not as toughnand confident as I might seem. I haven't really had a seriousngirlfriend expect for you.\" Sadie smiled and I kissed hernsoftly as she whispered,\" I liked it, I've never felt like thatnbefore.\" I smiled and kissed her once more as she buriednher head in my chest and I kissed her forehead softly, I was scarednat first of being so intimate with Sadie but now knowing that shenliked what I did made me feel a little better and she looked happier.nAnything to make her happy. Insmiled as she looked at me and I kissed her, I knew it was gettingnpretty late so we were probably heading out of here soon. I didn'tnknow if taking her here would be such a good idea but she surprisednme, she told me she enjoyed it and from the look on her face she didnenjoy it. \"I'mntired Jan.\" I smiled and kissed her as she zipped hernpants up and I held her close as we walked out of the frat house andnonce inside the car, she looked at me and I asked,\" Are younokay?\" She nodded. \"I'll be fine.\" Inwasn't so sure she was okay, I hoped that she wasn't having secondnthoughts about being with me and starting a relationship or what Lesnhad told her. I figured he told her that it wasn't a good idea and Injust hoped that she wasn't reading too much into what he had toldnher. \"GoodnightnJan.\" I smiled and looked at her and kissed her foreheadnas she smiled at me and I said,\" I'll call you tomorrow.\" \"Ok,nthanks for everything Jan. I had a lot of fun.\" \"Youndon't have to thank me.\" She smiled and hopped out of myncar and walked into her house and I waited until she made it in hernhouse and then sped off towards mine, I had cheerleading tomorrow andnthen I planned on dropping by Sadie's house and taking her out tonlunch, I just hoped she would be okay. Sadie'snPOV Maybenthis was too much for me, I thought maybe these feelings of beingnscared and afraid would go away but they were still with me. Maybe wenwere going to fast, maybe Les was right. Suddenly,nthe phone rang and I picked it up and said,\" Hello?\" \"Hey,nit's Missy.\" \"Oh hi Missy, how are you?\" \"I'mndoing fine, how about you?\" \"I'm a littlenconfused.\" \"What do you mean Sadie?\" Insighed. \"I think we may be moving to fast. We started anrelationship as soon as the trial was over.\" \"Sadie,nare you happy?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Inknow Les is upset, he doesn't think it's a good idea for the two ofnyou to date so suddenly.\" \"I think we are moving tonfast. I just need to take a break and collect my feelings.\" \"Thennmaybe you need to tell him that.\" \"I just don't knownhow.\" \"Talk to him, tell him you need time. He's notngoing to hate you.\" \"I know, I just need sometime tonthink this over and think if it's a good thing for me.\" Insighed as we finished the coversation and I realized I needed morenthan time, I know realized that starting a relationship with Jannright off the bat wasn't the best idea like I had thought at thentime. Jan'snPOV \"Sadie!nAre you here?\" I had tried calling her earlier but shennever answered and missy told me she had talked to Sadie last nightnand she sounded upset and worn out. I was glad that cheerleadingnended earlier so I could find out what was wrong with Sadie. Suddenly,nthe door opened and I saw Sadie standing there and I leaned over tonkiss her forehead but she back away from me. Inlooked at her and asked,\" Sadie, what's wrong?\" \"Incan't do this. I can't be in a relationship with you, it's toonsoon.\" \"Then we'll take it slow.\" \"Jan,nyou don't understand. I can't be in a relationship with you, I needntime away.\" \"But Sadie, I care about you.\" Tearsnstreamed down her face as she said,\" Please understand, I can'tnbe with you. I need time.\" She slammed the door in mynface and I was left to wonder, what had I just done?[Chapter 29] Aunnote: yes, they are taking a break, don't worry they will make ancomeback but not for a few chapters. Anfew days later... Jan'snPOV Inhadn't slept all weekend, I was convinced that I caused more pain tonSadie. She didn't answer my phone calls and wouldn't speak to me. Shenliterally cut me out of her life, it was awful. I wished I hadn'tnpushed her to be with me, maybe if I didn't push her we wouldn't benin the position we are in now. Inwas walking up to school when I saw Sadie talking to Les and as soonnas she saw me she bolted into the school, feeling dejected andnutterly confused I didn't even know what to do. \"HeynJan.\" \"Hi.\" Les sighed. \"Look,nSadie's feeling confused.\" \"No kidding Les, Inshould've let her cool down from the trial and shouldn't of pushednher to be with me.\" \"Sadie's a complex person. Shenjust needs time, you need to give her time and let her deal with hernemotions.\" \"What has she told you?\" \"She'snconfused, she doesn't know what to do.\" \"Why did shenbolt at the sight of me?\" \"She thinks you hate her,nI tried telling her that she's just dealing with her emotions butnshe's come to the conclusion that you hate her.\" \"WellnI don't.\" \"Just take it slow, don't hurt her anymorenthan she's already been hurt.\" \"I'd never do that tonher.\" \"Jan, she's just confused. She's never been innlove before and never had feelings for anyone, this is all new tonher.\" He was right, Sadie had never been with anyonenbefore. She'd never been hugged, kissed, cuddled, or anything that wenhad done in the past couple days. Never, she was never told that shenwas beautiful, funny, and that she was important. Sadie'snPOV Inshould've stayed home, the last couple nights had given me plenty ofntime to think about my relationship with Jan. I had thought about thengood and the bad sides to it and I couldn't really think of any badnthings about it, Jan made me feel beautiful and he treated me withnrespect but it all was too quick. \"Sadie!\" Itnwas Jan. Justnkeep walking Sadie, he will take the hint and leave you alone. \"Sadienplease!\" Instopped just as Jan touched my shoulder and I bit my lip from sayingnanything as he asked,\" Can we talk?\" \"I can'tntalk now Jan, I have a lot to do.\" \"Sadie please.nI'm not mad at you, I'm just confused.\" Thatnmakes two of us. Inlooked up at him and immediatly I wanted to aplogize for how stupid Inwas, I did have feelings for Jan but we were going way to fast. Inneeded time to think about this and I didn't want to rush intonsomething to only find that it was a bad idea. That was my mainnconcern. \"Sadie,nare you afriad of me or something?\" I shook my head.n\"Nope, I think we were moving too fast. I need time to think, Incan't do this right now.\" \"But Sadie, just give me anchance. I care about you and I want to be with you. I'm not going tonhurt you. I wouldn't do that to you. Why won't you give me anchance?\" \"I...I...can't handle this.\" Withnthat, I bolted from him running down the hall hearing people yell andnI knew I couldn't be here. Not with Jan, not now. AfternI told him that I needed a break, I knew that he would think I wasncrazy. Being with Jan was different, I'd never been with anyonenbefore. I've never done anything like that, it was all new to me. Indidn't how to deal with this. AllnI need is that I needed time.[Chapter 30] AunNote: yes these are pretty quick! I do hope you enjoy! Sadie's POV Curlingnup on my bed after leaving school, I didn't even want to think aboutnmy relationship with Jan but that was the only thing that was fillingnmy brain. We'd gone from hating each other since elementry tonbecoming friends to starting a relationship. How crazy is that? Inclosed my eyes remembering that night he stayed with me after thentrial and all the good feeling ran through my body, I could feel thentears streaming down my face and I was so afraid. When I was withnJan, I was content and he made me feel safe but there was this littlenfeeling in my stomach that was telling me that it wasn't a good idea.nI was utterly confused. Itnwas after the trial was over, Jan unlocked the passanger door but Inwas so worn out that I didn't want to get out. I heard the door opennand I sank into Jan's muscular arms as he held me close and kissed mynhead, I wrapped my arms around his neck as he picked me up and Inburied my chest into his neck as he whispered,\" It will be okay,nI won't hurt you.\" Once inside, he carried me upstairs tonmy room and I really liked being in his embrace and I never thoughtnthis would happen to us, the last couple weeks had been insane to saynthe least. I knew my life had changed when I started hanging out withnJan, I never thought that would happen. Henlaid me on the bed as I curled up on my bed and he seated himselfnnext to me and I asked,\" Why are you doing this Jan?\" Hensighed. \"Sadie, it's because I care about you. Things havenchanged between us and I want to help you. We are no longernenemies.\" I shook my head as he ruffled my hair andnkissed my head and I wrapped my arms around his waist as he intwinednhis fingers with mine and I felt his arms wrap around me and I justnfelt weak. \"Whatnare you thinking about?\" \"How weird and akward thisnis.\" I could tell he was smiling, he brushed his fingersnagainst mine as we laid in bed together and I didn't know what elsento do. This was a first me, I'd never been with a guy before no lessnlaying in bed with one especially Jan. Couldnlife get any crazier? Jan'snPOV \"Sweetheart,nis something bothering you?\" Inwas feeling sour ever since I got home from school, Sadie left schoolnin a hurry and I was feeling louiser than ever. I was so confused, Inwas head over heels in love with Sadie and she wanted nothing to donwith me. \"I'mnjust tired.\" \"Does it have anything to do with Sadienson?\" Howndoes she know? \"Jan,nyou've bellowed about how stupid and quiet this girl is and once younget to know you have completely changed your views. I know that youncare about her and that you have feelings for her but don't you thinknit was kinda quick that you two got together so fast?\" \"Wellnno.\" \"Well, I think it was. You didn't even began tonthink about the aftermath of the trial for Sadie. She's been throughnenough and you bullied her from elementry school to now, think of hownshe is feeling.\" She was right, I didn't even think ofnhow she was feeling but I was more concerned about our relationship.nI was happy with Sadie and I knew that she was happy that her mothernwas going to be put away for a long time but she didn't say anythingnto me about that. Wait, I didn't even ask. \"Jan,ndid you ever ask how she felt about the trial?\" \"Nope.\" \"Maybenyou should've thought about that before starting a relationship withnSadie.\" My mother walked out of the kitchen and I knewnshe was right, there were a lot of things I should've done but thatnwas the main thing. I knew I had to talk to Sadie but she wantednnothing to do with me so how was that going to work. Sadie'snPOV Inam in love with Jan. Nonyou aren't. It was way too soon. Well,nI feel something for him. Arenyou forgetting what he did to you all those years? Nonbut he changed. That'snjust what he wants you to think. No!nIt's not. Indid feel something for Jan but we were going way to fast, I hadn'tneven had time to think about the aftermath of the trial. My mothernwas going to be put away for a long time and my siblings were in anstable enviorment leaving me to myself. I was all alone, I didn'tnwant to live like this. Whynwas my life so complicated?[Chapter 31] AunNote: Alright, here is the next update and it's a bit of ancliffhanger so I do hope you enjoy it, please read and review! Bluehaven4220:nhere is more more more for you! You will see how she reacts and whatnJan does but you already what know will happen! Enjoy! Missy'snPOV Infeel bad for Sadie but I knew this was taking a toll on Jan, I couldntell that he had feelings for Sadie. It was beyond obvious to me, youncould see it in his eyes and the way he spoke and I knew that hendidn't mean to hurt her. He didn't hurt her but you could tell thatnhe felt bad, it was strange knowing how felt about her in thenbeginning of the year to now feeling bad about hurting her. \"Havenyou talked to him lately Les?\" Les shook his head.n\"Yesterday, I did. He's still miserable, I know he cares for hernbut he should've thought about how she felt after the trial and notnrushed into a relationship.\" Innodded. \"Did you ask her how she felt about him?\" \"Indid and she said she did have feelings for him and the last couplendays that they were together, she enjoyed being with him but it wasnall so quick.\" \"Inthink they would be cute togther though.\" Les snorted.n\"You are crazy.\" I smiled. \"I know I am butnwouldn't they be cute together?\" Les shrugged. \"It'snweird to think about them being together if you've known the two ofnthem as long as I have. He teased her since elementry school and madenfun of her every chance he got. Somedays, she would go home and crynbecause she was so fed up with him.\" \"I can see thatnhe's changed Les. I know that maybe hard for you to see but I seenit.\" He nodded. \"I guess he has but I think shenstill needs time.\" If time is what she needed and that'snwhat she would get, Jan tried his best to give her that. In Englishntoday, we didn't work on our projects but he would glance at Sadie ancouple times during class and I knew how much he wanted to be withnher and tell her that he loved her, I just hoped she wouldn't takenthis out on herself. I could tell that they both felt something fornone another but it wasn't up to us to tell Sadie that, it was up tonherself. Sadie'snPOV Thisnhouse doesn't feel the same, I can't hear yelling and screaming likeni used to. I don't hear the sound of footsteps of my siblings. I wasnalone in this house, i didn't like it. Tonight, I was going to visitnmy little sister for for awhile and I was excited to see her, Inhadn't seen her since the beginning of the trial. I was going tonvisit my little brother tihs weekend, they were both doing muchnbetter. My brother had gotten involved a young hockey league and henseemed to like it. Suddenly,nI heard a knock on the door and I rushed to get it and opened to seena flower delivery man waiting for me and he asked,\" Are younSadie Gilliam?\" Innodded. \"That's me.\" \"I have a dilivery fornyou.\" \"Oh ok.\" He smiled and said,\"nIf you could sign this.\" I signed it and picked up thenred roses and lillies, two of my favorite flowers. I smiled andnlooked inside the tag and it read,\" Sadie,nplease don't take this out on yourself. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinkingnof you and only thought of myself and how I felt for you. Please,ngive me a second chance. I care about you.\" Theynwere from Jan. I didn't even know what to think, I knew I cared aboutnhim and there were several instances in which he showed it, I wasnhappy and content with the outcome of the trial. I was happy beingnwith Jan but it was so quick, I didn't even know what to do. Maybenthis visit to my sister would help me feel better. That is what Inneeded. Anfew hours later... \"HinCarmen!\" Carmennjumped up and down and latched on to my leg as I hugged her and shensaid,\" Hi Sadie!\" Carmennwas staying with the The Hendersons, a family that lived on thenoutskirts of Los Angeles and she was loving her new family. I likednThe Hendersons, they were very gracious and sweet and a very lovingnfamily and that's what my little sister needed. LainenHenderson smiled. \"She's been talking about this all day, she'snvery excited to see you.\" \"I'm excited to see yountoo!\" Carmen smiled and hugged me again and said,\" Inmiss you Sadie.\" I smiled. \"I miss you too but arenyou liking your new home?\" Carmen eagerly nodded. \"Indo! Mommy makes me cookies every weekend.\" I smiled asnLaine looked at her and ruffled her hair and kissed her head as Inasked,\" Why don't you show me your new room?\" Shengrabbed my hand and I followed Carmen to her room, I was so thrillednbeyond belief that she was so happy. It's what I wanted. I wanted mynsiblings to be happy and I knew both of the foster families werengiving them the warm and comforting enviorment that they needed. \"See,nit's all pink!\" It was very pink but that was my littlensister's favorite color, the walls were light pink and the bordersnwere a little of ballerina's and dolls print. The rest of them roomnwas clean and neat, she had pink and white storage containers aroundnher room so she could find everything and of course she had barbiendolls everywhere. \"Younhave a lovely pink room!\" She smiled at me and hugged mynleg as I smiled and ruffled her hair as we sat down and began to playnwith her toys, she looked so happy and full of life. I had decidednnot to tell her about the aftermath of the trial, she was too youngnto understand what that meant and after discussing that with hernfoster parents we decided it was the best thing to do. \"Wherenis Jan Sadie?\" I blushed. \"He's not here rightnnow.\" She looked up at me and asked,\" Do you lovenhim Sadie?\" Mynface flushed, I didn't know what to do. Suddenly, all the badnfeelings that I had about Jan and our relationship disapeared and Inwas left feeling content and very foolish. I did love Jan, I wasnhiding my feelings for him because I was afraid but now they werentelling me that I needed him more than anyone in the world. \"Indo Carmen but I was scared.\" \"Why? Jan likesnyou.\" This girl is smart for a five year old. I nevernwould've thought my own five year old sister would make me realizenthat I do love Jan. I would've thought it would've been someone elsenor that I would make that realization. \"It'snhard to describe sweetie but I do love him.\" She smilednat me as I wished I would've told Jan how I felt instead of pushingnhim away, that's what I was doing to him. Pushing him away because Inwas afraid, I was no longer afraid. I knew that I had to tell him andntell him soon before he got fed up and moved on and I no longer had anchance. Insmiled as Carmen smiled and said,\" Tell him I said hello.\" Insmiled and ruffleld her hair and said,\" I will sweetie.\" Fornthe next hour, I played with my little sister thankful that shenhelped me realize this. Jan was in love with me, he cared about menand took things slow and didn't rush me. He made me feel loved but Inpushed him away thinking that he was just doing this to be nice andnwasn't sure of his intentions but then I had come to realize with thenhelp of my little sister that he did love me and my feelings for himnwere stronger than I had thought. \"Cannyou put me to bed Sadie?\" I smiled as Laine walked in andnI said,\" Sure, I can.\" She smiled as I watchednCarmen walk out and Mr. Henderson appeared and she hugged him as henkissed her head and said,\" Goodnight baby doll, mommy and daddynwill be down the hall.\" I smiled at the three of them,nLaine looked at Carmen and kissed her head and said,\" Goodnightnsweetie.\" \"Night mommy and daddy.\" Insmiled as they set her down and I helped her get dressed and brushnher teeth, it had been a long time since I had done this. I missed itnbut I was extremely happy that my little sister was enjoying her timenwith her foster family, they were great people and I was glad that itnwasn't like the life she had lived before. \"GoodnightnCarmen, I love you and I'll see you soon.\" \"I wuvnyou too Sadie, can Jan come see me sometime?\" I smiled.n\"I'll see what I can do.\" \"Ok Sadie, benhappy.\" I smiled and kissed her head and said,\" Inlove you sweetie pie, I'm so happy that you are loving it here.\" Shensmiled and hugged me tight and I ruffled her hair and said,\"nGoodnight sweetie.\" I walked out of the room and saidngoodnight to the Hendersons, they smiled and thanked me for comingnover and I was happy to see my baby sister. Now, I was on a missionnto see Jan and hoped he was home. AsnI drove to his house, I thought of everything the two of us had donenand the time he spent with me. I was in love with him, everytime Inwas with him my pulse soared and my heart raced, if that wasn't loventhan I didn't know what it was. Great,nit was pouring rain and I hated it when it rained. Just my luck, I'llnbe standing outside of his house in the pouring rain telling him thatnI love him. Well, better now than never. Inwalked up to his house and knocked on the front door a couple ofntimes with no luck, I shook my head and turned around beginning thenwalk to my car when I heard the door open and I heard Jan yell,\"nSadie?\" I turned around and looked at him as he yellednlouder,\" What are you doing here?\" \"I hadnsomething to tell you.\" \"What's that?\" \"I'mnin love with you.\" Tonbe continued...[Chapter 32] Aunnote: here is the next chapter, hope you enjoy!

It's hard to imaginenbut you've made me happier than I've ever been.\" Instood there not knowing what to do, it was late and it was pouringnrain and there Sadie was standing in my front lawn proffesing thatnshe loved me. It had been a week since she wanted a break but it feltnlike months for me and I didn't think she would come around so soonnbut she did, it looked like she had been crying but it was raining sonit could a been a little bit of both. Sadienstood in front of me as I smiled at her now knowing if I should kissnor hug her, Sadie looked at me and leaned up and kissed me softly, Inwrapped my arms around her as she wrapped her arms around my neck asnI kissed her and I could hear her whispering,\" I'm sorry.\" Incupped her face in my hand and responded,\" I'm not mad at you.\" \"Incare about you Jan, I want to be with you and start a relationship.nIt's what I need and I'm in love with you.\" I kissed hernnose and I asked,\" Did you get my flowers?\" Shennodded. \"I did, I loved them and you can thank my little sisternalso.\" \"Why?\" \"Because,nshe's the one who made me realize that I do need you and that I am innlove with you.\" I nuzzled her cheek as she smiled at menand said,\" I'm soaken wet.\" I chuckled as she smilednat me and said,\" I just had to tell you that I am crazy aboutnyou.\" \"Thenfeeling is mutual.\" She smiled and kissed me as we stoodntogether and I smiled and nuzzled her cheek as she hugged me andnsaid,\" I still want to take it slow Jan.\" \"Wenwill.\" I smiled and kissed Sadie on the nose as shengiggled and said,\" I'm so wet.\" I chuckled andnkissed her nose as she nuzzled her face into my chest and I wasnhappier than ever, I had Sadie but I was still going to take it slownand not rush her. I didn't expect this, I figured it would take hernmuch longer but I knew that maybe she was in the middle and justnconfused about what to do. \"SonI'll pick you up tomorrow?\" She eagerly nodded. \"Inwould like that Jan, do you have anymore games that I could comento?\" \"I think we have a couple coming in and then wenmight be going to nationals.\" \"Really?\" Insmiled and kissed her nose as she smiled and said,\" I need tonget home and change but I wanted you to know how I felt.\" Inkissed her nose as she smiled at me and I responded,\" I'll picknyou tomorrow Sadie.\" \"Ok bye Jan.\" Inkissed her once more as she smiled and hugged me, I was loving everynsecond of this. I was beyond relieved that she wanted to be with me.nI knew only things would get better from here on out. Thennext day... Sadie'snPOV Indecided to do something a little different today, dress a littlendifferent. A few days ago, I checked out a new store at the mall andnI fell in love with their clothes. They were funky and cute, I boughtnsome cute stuff and decided to wear one of my favorite today. Itnwasn't cold out today, it was actually extremely beautiful out. AsnI began to get dressed, I had to imagine what Jan would think. It'snso weird that we are dating but I guess anything can happen. I am innlove with him and he's been there for me and I am happy with him. Ingrabbed my bag and threw it over my shoulder and walked downstairsnand stopped by a mirror in the dining room to admire myself, I lovednthe new outfits that I found. \"Sadie!\" Ingiggled at the sound of his voice, I used to hate the sound of hisnvoice but now i loved it. I walked to the front door and opened it asnhe was surprised to see me, I smiled and asked,\" Do you like? Inbought this the other day.\" He leaned over and kissed menand whispered,\" I love it.\" My style of clothing wasndifferent than most girls, I loved the vintage eccentric side ofnfashion so I usually mixed leggings with shorts or skirts andnsometimes I wore long shirts over my black leggings. Today, I wasnwearing tweed brown shorts with brown tights underneath and brownnflats with a white button up top and I had a white and brown headbandnto match. I had to say that I looked pretty darn good if I say sonmyself. \"Younlook beautiful Sadie.\" I blushed as he held my hand andnwe walked to his car and he asked,\" Sadie, have you given anynmore thought to USC?\" I smiled and said,\" No, Inhaven't. I promise I will look into that.\" Truth is, Inhad and I already had an appointment with a counsler next week. Inchecked out the communcations program after further talking to Roger.nI was going to surprise Jan, I knew he would like this and I wantednit to be a surprise and I wanted to be with him once we left highnschool.[Chapter 33] AunNote: here is the next chapter, I fastforwarded it alot butneverything will all be explained and there are only two more chaptersnleft and there is smut, I do hope you enjoy.

The pay was prettyngood and Sadie was working part time but would return after the birthnour of baby. \"Jan,nwe've been in here for our twenty four hours. What the hell is takingnso long?\" I leaned over and kissed her head as she smilednand responded,\" I hate this, I really do.\" I kissednher softly and whispered,\" I'll be right here.\" Secondsnlater, our doctor walked in and he announced that she was in factnready.
