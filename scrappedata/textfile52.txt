One smiles up at the other and grabs her hand withna childish smile. The second returns the smile, and hugs the first. The younger, smallernface belongs to a girl of about five years. She stares openly at thensidewalk, watching and waiting for someone. Her hair is long andnblonde, braided into two even braids that curl at the tips. Her brownneyes (so curious and innocent) squint as she laughs. The other,npresumably her mother, kisses the top of her daughter's head as theynwait. Although you can't tell it, she is just as excited (if not morenso) as her daughter. Finally, after whatnseems like ages to both females, a rather short figure with a top hatnand cane waltzes up the sidewalk. It is obvious that this verticallynchallenged Father-Husband is the source of emotional chattering innthe apartment. Both pairs of eyes light up at the welcoming sight,nthough the Mother-Wife tries to act more reserved and calm about it. You seem himneveryday , she tells herself.

There'rena lot of fears like that, but the combined effort of her husband andndaughter soothing her, the fears are disappearing. As she puts thenlast plate on the table, the door opens quietly.

The countryside was beautiful on that spring day but little did he know what was lurking behind the doors of Mike's apartment. Mike himself had never had a child or anything that constituted as a relationship of any kind because he liked his own space. Just so, he had no idea how to deal with anyone else living under the same roof as him. So when Sam's father died three years ago, Mike had read his mother's will and saw his name right next to Sam's. Meaning that his mother wanted Mike to be Sam's caregiver being that he was a living relative whom she trusted, having no knowledge while she was living of his abusive nature. Sam of course didn't either. Mike picked him up in a ratty old car with broken headlights and grungy seatbelts. He had to clutch the suitcase of his favorite things to his chest to keep it from falling all over the floor of the car and making Mike angry as if he wasn't boiling mad already having to see Sam in person. His aunt had lived across the country from Mike and he had liked her well enough. Sam just had a few quirks that Mike wasn't used to and he was doubting his ability to even comprehend what was going on with his father dying. When they got to the house, Sam held his hat to his head and held his suitcase even tighter. The door opened revealing Mike's messy apartment and the kitchen full of dirty dishes. Sam swallowed nervous and told himself he had to clean the sink out when Mike got him settled in. \"Hmmm.\" Mike grumbled walking away after he tossed the rest of Sam's suitcases to the ground. He picked them up as best he could and adjusted his hat so that Sam could see better. Mike flopped down on the couch and he cranked the tv volume up loud as if to drown out the existence of Sam altogether. He tried to sit down but Mike was on his feet. \" Get outta my way!\" He yelled and Sam sat at the kitchen table until the house became dark and cold. He rubbed himself a little to get warm and waited as Mike went upstairs to bed. \" Uh Mike?\" Sam asked finally having enough courage to ask his cousin straight on. \"What dorkus?\" \"Where- do I sleep?\" Mike looked around at his suitcases still full and his hat and cane on the kitchen table. \" Get the hell off my couch!\" Mike yelled ripping the suitcases off the couch and grabbing the hat and cane of Sam's off the table. \" Sleep?\" Sam asked and Mike threw open the sink cabinet. \"Here.\" \"There?\" \" Yeah are you blind?\" Sam was confused but slid down into the space anyway. \" Mike? Why no bed?\" \" Because you aren't good enough for a bed.\" \"Why?\" His brown eyes were so innocent looking and Mike was so harsh in his expression that Sam had no clue what he had done wrong by being there in the first place. \" Sleep. You get the sink.\" Mike said and Sam was uncomfortable in such a small space. But he had enough room to breathe if he slept upside down. Mike was on the stairs as he said \"Breathe through your nose jacka**.\" Sam heard the cabinet doors close and Mike's footsteps descended the stairs leaving his cousin all alone downstairs. Three years later, Mike wondered why Sam was busy polishing forks and silverware and too busy watching crappy old movies to sleep. Sam was dyslexic courtesy of spending three years in a lonely house with a cousin who didn't like him breathing in kitchen sink cleaners. He mixed up N and U and thought he was a bad person because Mike abused him constantly. He never got hit it just was verbal abuse and Sam didn't understand why he received it because all he did was live there with Mike. Mike brought him to a poker game with Benny Pearl and his friend Thomas just to get the sound of his cousin's voice out of his head who stayed up all night, after getting promoted to the floor of Mike's kitchen, watching old movies with Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn. Mike was wishing, praying that somebody was dumb enough to actually take him home and off his back. Benny was that sucker when Joon lost a hand of cards putting a genuine yet evil smile on Mike's face as he dropped Sam outside on his butt and left him there. Sam was getting used to the way things were at the house and had accepted them for what they were as is. So when Benny gave him his own freaking couch to sleep on and didn't make him get off of it, Sam was overjoyed. \"Thanks for the couch Benny.\" \"No problem Sam.\" Benny said as he went upstairs for the night. \"Sleep well.\" Sam was astonished. Nobody had ever cared enough to say that to him before. He was happy and went to sleep smiling. \"I will Benny. Thank you.\" It had been a few weeks and Sam was adjusting to his new life as a member of the Pearl household. He liked the housekeeper job and Joon was really cool. She was mentally ill but he still saw her heart and loved when she showed him the way she felt on the inside. \"Joon?\" \"Yes?\" \"Is this okay with you?\" He kissed her. It was sweet and soft and Sam had never done it before. He of course knew how his body was supposed to move against hers as they kissed each other but he wasn't sure entirely how to go about it. \"I love you Joon.\" Sam said and she responded with the same words. Benny was sitting at the kitchen table with a freshly cleaned up Sam and Joon after another one of their rendezvous. He had no idea they were having sex and she wanted to keep it that way but it was so awkward with the three of them in the same room that Joon told Sam it was okay to tell her brother their secret. \"You what?\" \" I had sex with Joon. We love each other and I promise I will take care of her.\" Sam said. Benny was so angry that he grabbed Sam and carried him outside. Back to Mike's all over again. He thought but was surprised when Benny threw him out on the porch anyway. \" No! Don't.\" But the door slammed and Sam was left alone again. He heard Joon screaming from inside and felt a smile form its way across his face as she said \"Stop! I want him!\" I do too. Sam told her telepathically even though he knew Joon had so many other voices in her head that she couldn't hear him. She got louder. \"I love him!\" \"You're crazy!\" He felt bad that Joon and Benny were fighting over him but he was proud that Joon was standing up to him. Sam had never really learned how to do that with Mike or with Benny for that matter because he had a lot of respect for him. Sam respected Mike for years too it's just hurting someone is not love and Joon doesn't hurt me. Sam said to himself as Joon ran upstairs away from Benny. I'll come back later. Sam said as he looked up at Joon's room. He left for a while. He knew he couldn't come back. So, instead of upset Benny more than he already had by telling him secrets, Sam climbed up his tree and slept there all night, crying because he missed Joon so much. The next day, Joon got sick and had to go to the hospital. Sam stayed with her and waited as the doctor took her into a back room to examine. Benny came in and Sam cautiously looked up, with his brown puppy dog eyes and full lips waiting for judgement. \" You're a first class moron. Idiot.\" Benny said. He grabbed him by the jacket ends and slammed Sam up against the wall. \"I hope you're happy with what you done to her. Stay the hell away from Joon. My sister.\" He knew Benny was angry at him but Sam shook his head telling the truth. \"No. No.\" \" What?\" \"I can't do that Benny. I meant what I said yesterday. I love her. I love Joon and want to take care of her. It's not going to go away. No matter what you want to do to me or how hard you hit me.\" Benny slapped Sam's face. It only hurt for a second and Sam welcomed it with honor and gratitude because he did like Benny. At least better than Mike. Benny gave him a bed. Sam said \"Mike made me sleep under the sink. You gave me food and clothes and a real bed. I am grateful for that. Even if you want to hit me.\" Benny softened and put Sam down. \" I'm sorry Sam. I didn't mean to hit you. I just want to protect my sister from-\" \"You're scared Benny. I see it and it's because of me. I see the way you love her but I love Joon that way as well. Differently than you do but still the same love that you have for her.\" \"I know. I see that too.\" They smiled at each other and Sam straightened himself out. Benny hugged Sam and he was pleasantly surprised by that not being loved by Mike at all. But Benny and Joon were different and he liked that they loved him. \" Benny I look up to you.\" Sam said and he smiled again. \"Let's go get Joon. I got a surprise.\" Sam followed and Joon jumped out og bed and hugged him tight. Sam and Joon now live together in their friend Ruthie's apartment building. Benny of course still visits sometimes but he trusts Sam to take care of his little sister. Sam is loved and never to be abused again by anyone living in the Pearl household.

I do however own Gracie and Jonathan. This is what I think would've happened of Sam had never met Joon, but someone else instead. R&R; please! Sam had just stepped off of the train, with no where to go but his cousin's place. He wasn't fond of his cousin, but he dealt with it anyways. The truth was, no one in his family really accepted him. He was the disappointing loser who couldn't read, no matter where he went. So he'd decided to change scenery, crash with his cousin for a while, find a job, and start living on his own. He'd really like that. His cousin was no where to be seen when he grabbed his few bags and headed towards the door. Looks like he'd be hoofing it, he thought, until he finally saw his cousin. Looking more irritated by the second. He rushed up to meet him. \"Hi Mike,\" Sam said respectfully. \"Yeah, whatever. Come on asshole.\" Mike replied. Sam followed obediently, head down. He knew he could be better than he was, but he didn't think he deserved that treatment. He sighed, and got into Mike's car, careful not to dirty it or scratch it. When they got to Mike's place, Sam carefully took his shoes off at the front door. He lifted his hat off of his head, letting his chin length brown locks fall into his face. \"Don't make a mess.\" Mike said. \"And stay out of my shit.\" \"Okay.\" \"I can't believe I let your mom talk me into letting you stay here.\" Mike said. \"You can sleep under the sink.\" Sam put his suitcases down under the sink before putting his shoes on and going back outside. This was not going to be easy at all, he thought. But he'd do anything to just get on his feet and away from his cruel family. He wondered if there were others out there like him. He didn't know anybody else his age that couldn't read. He hoped that one day, he'd find a soul like his own to share his life with. He looked up at the moon in the night sky and smiled. Somewhere, there was a special woman out there looking up at the same moon. \"Gracie! C'mon, it's eleven. You're up past your bed time.\" A tired man in his thirties said. He had sandy blonde hair and green eyes. He wasn't thin, but he wasn't fat, just average. He was quite muscular from working at his furniture store. He was constantly re-arranging the displays so that they looked enticing to the customers. He sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Gracie! What's taking so long?\" He asked, a little irritated. \"I can't find Hammerstein.\" Gracie said timidly. She came into the bedroom, teeth brushed and hair in braids. \"For crying out loud, Gracie. You're 23 years old! You don't need your stuffed hippo to sleep. It's just a toy.\" The man said. \"How can you say that to me Jonathan?\" Gracie sniffled. Gracie was not like other women her age. Gracie was not like them at all. Sure, Gracie looked like an average woman, with her short frame and soft curves. She had dark brown hair and brown eyes, with full pouty lips and pale skin. She stared at her brother Jonathan. He'd been in charge of her care since their parents died 9 years ago. She'd always had something different about her, but after they died, it got worse. The psychiatrists diagnosed her with paranoid schizophrenia, and due to it's severity, she had to have supervision at all times. \"I know, I'm sorry Gracie. Just get into bed and I'll find him for you.\" Jonathan said. Gracie nodded, climbing under the purple blanket on her full sized bed. In some ways, Gracie was very mature and grown-up, but in other ways, she could be extremely childish and stubborn. For example, she could speak in a manner that made English professors feel uneducated, but she could also throw her share of tantrums. Sometimes, she even used those childish moments to manipulate people into giving her what she wanted, like tonight. Today, her childishness had driven away her day-time caregiver, a kind woman named Mrs. Warner who stayed with her while Jonathan was working. Mrs. Warner was the fifth caregiver to quit in the past two months. Jonathan returned with Hammerstein the hippo, so named because of her love for Roger and Hammerstein musicals. She would've named him Roger, but she didn't feel that Roger the hippo sounded nearly as cool as Hammerstein. \"Here you go.\" He said, tossing the stuffed animal to Gracie. \"Thanks.\" She said softly, snuggling the hippo to her face. \"I still can't believe you locked Mrs. Warner out of the house today. That was completely uncalled for.\" Jonathan scolded gently. \"She made me angry.\" Gracie argued. \"I had no choice.\" \"Uh-huh.\" Jonathan replied. \"Did you say your prayers?\" \"Yep. I said them before I brushed my teeth and braided my hair.\" She told him. \"Good girl. Go to sleep now.\" He said. He kissed his little sister on the forehead and shut off the big light, making sure the hippo shaped nightlight in the corner of the room was on. \"Good night, Jonathan. Love you.\" Gracie said. \"I love you, too. Good night, Gracie. Sweet dreams.\" He replied before shutting her door. As soon as she heard his footsteps disappear down the hallway, she shuffled out of bed and went to sit in her window seat. She loved to sit there at night, looking up at the moon and stars. She sometimes talked to the moon, confiding in it. Tonight she told it another of her dreams. She dreamed of living on her own one day, of overcoming her fear of being alone. Well, due to the voices, she was never completely alone. She hated hearing those voices. They weren't cruel or anything, but she'd been called crazy because of them, and she hated to think she was crazy. \"I'm not crazy,\" she whispered to no one. \"I'm not crazy.\" She looked back up to the moon, wishing that one day she could be independent and normal, and maybe even meet Prince Charming. She smiled at the thought of that. She'd always wanted her very own Prince Charming. She smiled up at the moon, knowing that if he existed, he was probably looking at the same moon right now. She said another prayer, asking God to protect her Prince Charming, too, and to bring him to her soon. Then she climbed back into bed and fell fast asleep. ","Summary":" I don't own Benny & Joon.

A few hours passed and Joon was so into her painting she didn't even see Sam come in. \" Joon I'm home\" he called as he sat the grocery bags on the counter. Sam looked around but still no Joon. \" Joon?\" he called as he wondered the house. Then Sam walked into the painting room and saw Joon painting away. Sam smiled and stood behind her but he said nothing because he remembered Benny telling him once never to disturb her while she was painting. Then Joon put her paint brush behind her ear and closed one eye to get a better look at her painting. \" Finished\" she smiled proudly. Sam moved a bit closer to get a better look. \" D-don't touch it….it's still wet\" Joon whispered. Sam nodded and continued to examine it then Sam smiled at her. \" It's beautiful\" he said as he gave her a kiss on the cheek. Joon giggled and looked down at her feet. \" So how about some breakfast?\" she asked. \" Breakfast? But Joon it's lunch time now\" Sam said confused. Joon laughed and playfully pushed his shoulder. \" Sam your starting to sound like Benjamin it's never to late for breakfast!\" she laughed as she walked into the kitchen. \" R-right\" Sam nodded as he followed her inside. Sam sat at the counter as Joon put cereal and milk in the blender and pressed the button. After it was blended Joon poured a cup for Sam and her and they drank it in silence. When Joon lowered her glass Sam started to laugh. \" What is it? What's so funny?\" Joon frowned. Sam said nothing and walked up to her trying to hold back his laughter and grabbed a cloth. \" Milk…mustache\" Sam smiled as he wiped the cloth above her upper lip. Then Sam froze and set down the cloth. He started at her lips for a moment and caressed her cheek. Joon smiled and continued to drink her breakfast and Sam nervously ran his hand threw his hair then he grabbed his hat and started throwing it and twirling it in his hands. \" Hey Joon?\" he whispered as he stood and sat down his hat. \" Yes\" she said as she put down her glass and removed her paint brush from her ear and placed it in her biboveral pocket. \" I..I love you\" he smiled. \" Me too\" she smiled as she pushed one strand of her short golden hair behind her ear. Then out of no where Sam dropped down on both knees and looked up at her with his big brown eyes. \" Will you marry me Joon?\" Joon giggled and looked at her feet again. \" Y-yes\" she nodded. Sam stood and smiled then he held up one finger for her to wait a moment and he went behind the counter where he was once sitting and put a Jack in the Box on the table and pushed it over to her. \" Crank the handle\" he said as he made the movement with his hand. Joon laughed and turned the handle and Sam watched her intently as the music echoed threw their house then it stopped and Jack popped out of the box and they both jumped. Then Joon saw something shinny on Jack's hand it was a diamond ring and the biggest smiled spread across her face. Sam smiled at her and took the ring and slipped it on her paint covered finger.

I do not own these characters. I just think they should live on in little acts of love. Dedicated to my two reviewers: xXRemXx and BlackwingRose. Green Eggs and Sam He never looked her way, but Joon knew very well that Sam was making a play for her attention. Joon never looked Sam's way, but he knew very well he had it. Joon was doing a very poor job of pretending to read. But, even as he expertly balanced his cane on-end in the palm of his hand – being sure to make it look difficult – Joon continued to try and ignore him. Exasperated, finally, Sam dropped his cane and crawled his way across the couch to Joon's side. He put his chin on her shoulder and stared at her with his large, chocolate-brown eyes. There was no way she could ignore him now. Yet, she did. Frustrated but undaunted – he was forced to resort to words. \"What are you reading?\" he asked softly, still staring up at her. He knew that if she would just look at him . . . well, he could think of better things to do than reading. Joon did not react, but, inside, she was smiling. He was too easy. She had him right where she wanted him. A simple plan executed perfectly. \"Dr. Seuss,\" she replied flatly, still refusing to look at him. She did, however, close the book and turn the cover in his direction. \"Green Eggs and Ham,\" she read. \"Why would anyone write a book about that?\" Sam asked grimacing. Joon did not reply, but instead opened to the first page. Immediately, the book had his attention. \"Sam!\" Sam's eyes lit up with childish curiosity. \"Why does this book have my name in it?\" Without thinking he took the book from her and studied the page. The words seemed simple enough, but he had always preferred movies to books. Joon read the page aloud, \"I am Sam.\" Sam looked at her with mock confusion, \"No, I'm Sam. You're Joon.\" Joon giggled and turned the page. \"You can read this whole book, you know.\" Suddenly, Sam looked gravely serious. There was hurt in his eyes, \"You know I can't.\" \"Yes, you can. I'll show you.\" On the next page, the words were repeated. Joon read, \"I . . . am . . .\" She looked up at Sam who had been frowning intently at the child's book in his lap. His part in the game finally dawned on him and he broke into a wide smile. \"Sam!\" he read and eagerly turned the page. \"Sam I am,\" he read. The simplicity and truth of the statement made him laugh. He turned to smile at her. Joon did not return the smile, but said seriously, \"I realize this book may seem far below your intellectual capacity. But viewed from the proper angle, Dr. Seuss always has more profound meaning.\" For a moment, Sam looked at her blankly, then turned his attention back to the book. Slowly, he continued reading. When he stopped, Joon picked up the story, \"Do you like green eggs and ham?\" \"I don't think so,\" replied Sam seriously. \"Green apples are okay though.\" \"No silly, in the book!\" Sam laughed. He knew. Now, he vaguely remembered hearing this story before, read to him as a child by someone with much less patience for his disability. Joon liked playing teacher, and it was made all the more enjoyable as Sam curled himself against her so they could both read from the book. His voice was soft and the heat of his body made her sleepy and made her want him at the same time. \"Joon?\" Lost in the pleasant rumble of his voice, Joon had missed her cue to read a word he did not know. Joon startled back to life, as Sam looked at her curiously. His original reason for distracting Joon had slipped his mind when she gave him the book. Suddenly, he remembered his task. Sam dropped the book and leaned in to kiss her. As always, Joon demurred at first, dropping her head. Sam simply waited – his soft, brown eyes on her, full lips parted – wanting – but more than willing to wait. When it came to physical affection, it was Sam's turn to be teacher, and his patience was always equally rewarded. Joon pulled herself up to her knees beside him and put her arms around his neck. Then, she traced a gentle finger over his lips. Sam watched her, smiling. He kissed her fingertips, but otherwise did not move. Joon loved how he let her touch him – allowed himself to be explored until she was secure. Then, hands in his dark hair, she kissed him. Sam pulled her closer. No longer needing to hold back, he kissed her will all the passion and desire he had been imagining earlier that afternoon. His slender hands finding their way beneath her shirt, Sam turned Joon and tugged her into his lap, that he might possess her more completely. He was so enjoying the kiss, when suddenly a question popped into his mind like an itch that had to be scratched. \"I have to know, \" he whispered urgently. \"What?\" Joon asked dazedly, a little annoyed at the distraction. \"How does it end?\" \"What?\" \"The book. How does it end?\" Joon reached up and brushed the hair away from Sam's face. Her fingers lingered on his cheek, \"Thank you. Thank you, Sam I am.\" Sam chuckled, \"You're welcome, Joon,\" as he leaned down to kiss her again. ","Summary":" No disclaimer necessary. I do not own these characters.

It was never mentioned in the commentary and the house still stands because I have seen it. I see it every time I go to Spokane and the only thing that is gone is the art studio and the tree is gone too and the top windows on the roof. I can't imagine Benny and Joon losing their house and all their stuff so Benny still has his house in my stories. Plus Benny had on the same clothes he had on before in the movie unless he was able to find the same ones in a second hand store but what are the chances of finding the exact same pair or did he find something similar? And why is Joon wearing the same dress at the end she had on before in the movie? Perhaps she brought it with when she ran off with Sam? I know it's just a movie. Characters can magically have their clothes again after losing them. But the part where Benny holds Joon's jack in the box says it all. The top is darker and you see something black next to him but I always thought it was a tree. The toy has always looked damaged the day she got it so I never new the difference and I could only see the top of it when he had it. Well it looked dirty, not damaged lol, the top that is. Then I noticed it was darker so I figured it was dirtier, not that it was from smoke. But the house did burn down in the script. Benny somehow found his way to the hospital. He parked his car and went inside. He saw Sam sitting in the front area of the building. Benny ignored him. He went through a door and went up to the receptionist.

What the hell is she doing here? \"Can I help you?\" the receptionist asked. \"I would like to see Joon please,\" said Benny. \"I'm afraid that's impossible,\" she said. \"No visitors allowed at this time of day.\" \"Look,\" said Benny. \"I am going to see my sister. Now would please just tell me her room number?\" \"Please sir, could you just come back in the morning?\" the receptionist asked. \"Let me talk to her god damn doctor,\" Benny shouted. \"I'm sorry,\" said Dr. Garvey. \"She doesn't want any visitors. Not you or anyone else.\" \"She doesn't want to see me?\" said Benny. \"No and she doesn't want to leave. Benny, you should go home, get some sleep and I promise I will keep in touch.\" Benny walked out the door and went to the entry way. Sam was sitting in one of the chairs. He got up as Benny walked up to him. \"I hope you're happy,\" Benny said angrily as he walked up to him.\"I hope you are happy of what you've done to her,\" he said as he grabbed Sam by the shirt and pushed him against the wall. He pointed his finger in his face. \"You just stay the hell away from my sister.\" \"No,\" said Sam and he shook his head. \"No.\" Benny tightened his grip on his shirt. \"Do you know why everyone laughs at you Sam? Because you're an idiot. You are a first class moron.\" Benny let go of him and kept glaring at him. \"You're scared, Benny,\" said Sam. \"I'm what?\" he asked. He didn't catch what he said. \"You're scared,\" Sam said again. \"I can see it and I know why. I used to look up to you. Now I can't look at you at all.\" Sam turned around and left the building. In the hospital room: Joon laid in her bed in her new home. She was very devastated. She lost Sam because Benny took him away from her and plus she scared him away by her behavior on the bus and she was going to be put in a group home so she had nowhere else to go, so she was better off in the hospital. She was in her hospital gown, and a bath robe. She was having nightmares about her brother. She dreamt that she got taken to a group home and she was treated worse there than she did at home. She was always locked in her room, she had no freedom and she couldn't paint and do what she wanted to do. Only time she was allowed to leave her room was to eat and she wasn't allowed to leave the place either. Other people there were locked in their rooms too because they were crazy just like her and they didn't deserve to go out in public or they'll scare people and put on a big scene. After having the nightmare, Joon woke up covered in sweat. She saw where she was and then she remembered she was in the hospital. She got out of bed and looked out the window. She rocked back and forth as she looked out. Thank god it was only a dream. Somewhere in the city: Benny spent the rest of the night moping. He was very depressed. He had lost Joon. He had failed being a good brother. Then the sky started to get a little light. Day light was coming. He went to a train yard. He got on one of the train tracks and walked on it. He hoped a train would come and run him over and poof, that would be the end of his depressing life. Then he heard a train coming. He heard it tooting. Yes, finally, he thought. The train slowed down as it got closer to the conjoined tracks. Benny kept walking and then the train caught up to him. It got closer and closer and the train driver saw him and tooted his horn. Get out of the way man, he thought. Here it comes here it comes. My death, Benny thought. Then his common sense hit him. He realized what he was doing was a dumb thing to do. Killing himself wouldn't bring his sister back so he stepped off the track. The train went by and Benny leaned against another boxcar that was just sitting there on another train track. Benny closed his eyes. He was pooped because he hadn't slept all night. He was too sad to sleep. Then he opened his eyes again. \"Must stay awake,\" he told himself and he kept on walking. He decided it was time to head back to his house and mope there. Sam went over to Ruthie's to stay since he had nowhere else to go. He knocked on her door. Ruthie got up and answered it. She was very happy to see Sam so she let him in. Sam told her everything about Joon. \"Oh I'm so sorry to hear it,\" said Ruthie. \"I hope she gets better.\" \"Me too,\" said Sam, \"and Benny.\" Soon the sun came up and Ruthie got dressed. She made herself some coffee to wake her up. She went back to the living room and sat down beside Sam. She felt sad for Joon too. Back at home, Benny drank a few bottles of beer. He sat in the living room and then he closed his eyes to rest them but he didn't know he fell asleep. He had a dream, the one that he would never forget. Benny's parents came home. They went into the living room. \"Oh look at this,\" said Margaret as she kicked the beer bottles. Benny woke up. He saw his mom and dad. Benny rubbed his eyes trying to wake himself up but they were really there. \"Mom? Dad?\" he asked. \"I thought you guys were dead?\" \"We are son,\" Robert replied. \"But we came back because we are very disappointed in you.\" \"I know. I tried everything,\" said Benny. \"I worked really hard taking care of her and I failed.\" \"You damn right sure did,\" said his father. \"I know,\" said Benny. \"I was naive and wasn't careful.\" \"No, you were overprotective,\" his mother pointed out. \"You need to let her grow up,\" Robert told him. \"She is not a child. She's a grown up. She may be sick but she is still a human being and she deserves to have rights too just like us. That is why we're disappointed in you.\" \"She had someone she loved and you took it from her and that is why she had that breakdown on the bus so technically it was your fault, not Sam's. He didn't do it, you did,\" Margaret added. \"So, you know what you have to do now,\" said Robert. \"Do?\" Benny asked. \"Do what? What do I need to do?\" \"Think about it and you will know,\" said Margaret. \"Now we shall go back where we belong.\" They started to leave the living room but Benny got out of the chair. \"Wait,\" he shouted. \"I still don't know what I need to do.\" \"Keep thinking about it son and you will know,\" said his father when they went out the window. \"Don't go you two don't go,\" Benny shouted after them. \"Keep thinking about it son,\" his father kept saying as they went farther and farther up in the sky and then they were gone. Benny opened his eyes. He had just woken up from the dream. He saw himself sitting in the chair still with a beer bottle in his hand. He looked down and saw there were five more beer bottles lying next to him. \"Oh,\" Benny groaned. He got up and put down the bottle and walked around on the first floor. He remembered his dream. \"Think about it and I will know?\" he kept saying. \"What is there to know?\" He went in Joon's art studio. He saw the jack in the box Sam gave her on top of the Etch N Sketch on the table. He picked it up and looked at it. It reminded him of Joon. How happy she was and now she was unhappy but why? Benny went outside and sat down on a rock. He played with the jack in the box. He kept turning the handle and the clown kept coming out. Benny pushed the clown back in and closed the top and turned the handle again. \"She was very happy when Sam was there for her,\" said his conscience. Yeah, thought Benny. \"Look what you have in your hand,\" said the conscience. \"Sam gave that to her and you have it in your hands right now.\" That's because I miss Joon. \"And you love her so you will let Sam have her. He keeps her happy and he is the right person for her. He is the reason why she has been so content and why she hasn't been a handful lately until you kicked him out.\" Must find Sam then. \"Yes, that's right. You must find him and help get Joon back and let her grow up.\" \"Must find Sam,\" Benny told himself. \"Must get Joon.\" Benny stood up and looked across the river. \"Now I've got it,\" he shouted as he held his arms up in the air. The jack in the box fell out of his hand and into the river. It started to go downstream. \"No,\" Benny shouted. He waded in the river and grabbed the jack in the box before it could go down the river any farther. Benny got out of the river and went inside. His pants sagged and dripped. He set the jack in the box on the kitchen table and went to the phone. He picked it up and dialed Ruthie's number. I hope she's not at work, Benny thought. Then Ruthie answered the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Hi, it's me,\" said Benny. \"Benny?\" said Ruthie. \"Why are you calling?\" \"I did the worst terrible thing.\" \"I know,\" said Ruthie. \"I heard about it.\" \"You did? Great. Who told you?\" \"Sam. He came to my place today and stayed since he had nowhere else to go and he said Joon was in the hospital. I'm so sorry that happened but what's wrong with Sam having a relationship with her? She's a human being, not some person who needs to be sheltered and kept away from real life and you threw him out for that? You complain about your life being complicated and-\" \"That's where I meant where I did the terrible thing,\" Benny interrupted. \"I need to see Joon but no one there won't let me. All the receptionist did was tell me to come back in the morning and then Dr. Garvey tells me Joon doesn't want to see me.\" \"Of course not,\" said Ruthie. \"Would you want to see someone if he or she threw someone out you loved and you knew you were heading for a group home?\" Benny knew Ruthie wasn't happy to hear from him because he could tell by the tone in her voice. \"Just listen will you?\" said Benny. \"I made a mistake okay and I didn't even know it until I had this dream.\" \"What was the dream?\" Ruthie asked sounding more calm. \"I came home today and I drank a few bottles of beer and I fell asleep and then I dreamt about my mom and dad coming back and they told me how disappointed they were in me and they told me I need to let Joon grow up and that she was a human being and she deserved to have rights too like us.\" \"I agree with them,\" said Ruthie. \"And they told me that with Sam around, she has been happy ever since and I need to see him.\" \"Well he's not here right now,\" Ruthie replied. \"He left a bit ago to be at the hospital and then to work.\" \"Oh. Where does he work at?\" \"At some video store but jeas, I can't remember the name of it.\" Benny thought hard, trying to remember the name of the place Sam wanted to work at, the day he brought home the application. \"I think where he is working at is located in the down town area,\" said Benny. \"Oh god I gotta find him so he can help me get Joon back.\" \"Oh Benny, when are you going let her have a life?\" Ruthie sighed. \"That's why I have to get her out,\" Benny informed. \"I need to get her out of there so she can start her own life. You know, maybe I can find a home for her so she can live there by herself.\" \"I have an apartment here that is open,\" said Ruthie. \"The people moved out yesterday to their very own home they can afford. Jooncan live here. It won't cost her anything unless she has the money.\" \"She does,\" said Benny. \"She's on social security. That's how I could afford buying her paint and paint brushes and other stuff she needs. She's been on it for I don't know after she was diagnosed with being mentally ill. I gotta go now. I gotta shower up and get changed and then go Sam hunting and get Joon.\" \"Okay, good luck with that,\" said Ruthie. \"Bye,\" said Benny. \"Bye,\" said Ruthie and she hung up. Benny hung the phone up and went upstairs to shower. Benny walked around in the downtown area. He was dressed in different clothes. He asked around for any video stores in the area. Some were clueless because they were just tourists. \"There's a video store ten blocks away where you're standing,\" a lady told him. \"Thanks,\" said Benny and started to walk. When he got to American Classic Video store, he saw Sam's coat, cane and hat through the window. He saw Sam behind the counter talking to a lady and he was wearing different clothes than the day before. Benny went inside. \"Now who was that woman who starred in Roman-\" \"Audrey Hepburn,\" said Sam. \"Yeah,\" said the lady. \"Sam, thanks a lot.\" She picked up her videos. \"Have a nice day,\" said Sam as she left, then he noticed Benny. Benny was looking at him as he walked closer to the counter. He put his elbows on it and leaned over. \"Can I help you?\" Sam asked. \"Yeah I hope so,\" said Benny. \"I need your help to get Joon.\" \"Need my help? Hey you were the one who told me to stay away from her and you hate me, remember?\" \"But that was yesterday,\" said Benny. \"This is today and I need your help. I need to talk to her.\" \"Well, I'm sorry. I'm at work so I can't help you,\" Sam apologized. \"Look, I made a mistake okay? I'm sorry I kicked you out. I'm sorry I called you names. I'm sorry I threw your stuff out into the street and put on a scene. I'm sorry for everything.\" \"Okay okay, you're forgiven. But I'm at work right now so you're going to have to wait.\" \"Damn,\" Benny sighed. \"I'll come to your house after work okay?\" said Sam. \"Okay, sure,\" said Benny and he turned around and started to leave. After he had kicked Sam out, he had grabbed all his things anf threw them in the street yelling and kicking them. Sam saw it all as he was up in the tree. * * * Benny sat home all day. He called in sick that day so Eric took over the place. Benny remembered to feed his goldfish and they were still alive. He remembered when Joon gave them to him as a present. \"I'm so glad I decided not to kill myself,\" Benny told them. \"Then who would watch after you two? Oh yeah, Ruthie might have or Joon.\" He got up and went into her room. He looked at all her stuff. He spent time looking at her Barbie dolls on the shelf and then he noticed the picture frame on the nightstand was empty. No picture of him and Joon anymore. I wonder what happened to it, he thought. Benny looked around for it but he never found it. Oh well, it'll show up. Benny laid on Joon's bed and closed his eyes. He wondered how Joon was doing in the hospital. Was she happy there or sad? Was she doing better or worse? He picked up her monkey and looked at it. He tossed it up in the air for entertainment. He kept catching it and throwing it up in the air again. Then he got up and went downstairs for a drink of water. He got out a glass and went to the sink but when he was about to turn on the water, he saw something in the sink. There were little pieces lying around and most of it was black and very little of it was left. Benny studied it and then he realized what it was. It was a picture that got burned. Benny picked it up what was left of it. He could only see the car in the background. The rest was all gone. Then he realized it was the picture that was missing from the photo frame in Joon's bedroom. \"I can't believe she did this,\" Benny told himself. \"I'm surprised it was in the sink instead of on the floor. It would have burned the whole place down and I'd be homeless for awhile.\" Benny washed the rest of the burned pieces down the drain and filled his glass up with water. He threw the rest of the picture away as he drank. He put the glass in the sink and went into Joon's art studio. He looked at all her paintings. Then he heard a knock at the door. Benny left the studio and went to the door. It was Sam. He was wearing his coat and hat. He had his cane in one hand. Benny answered the door. \"Hey, you're back so soon?\" \"I work part time,\" Sam replied. \"Let's get Joon.\" Benny closed the door behind him and they went to the hospital. \"So Benny, what made you decide not to hate me anymore?\" Sam asked as they got in the El camino. \"I realized you kept Joon happy and she needed you,\" said Benny as he got in. \"Without you, she's miserable. After I kicked you out, she went back to her old self again. She burned a picture of her and me when we were kids and she left the house and had that breakdown on the bus. But I made a mistake.\" Benny started the ignition. \"You sure right you did,\" said Sam as Benny drove off. \"I thought you were taking advantage of her,\" said Benny. \"I didn't know she could actually love someone.\" \"Duh,\" said Sam as he leaped over a fire hydrant. \"Do you remember yesterday morning in the shower when you told me except for being mentally ill, she is pretty normal?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, you were right. She is normal and I ignored what you said. She helped you with your application, she got me two goldfish, and she helped get me a girl and I blew it.\" \"Blew it?\" Sam asked. \"When I dropped Ruthie off at her apartment after our dinner, she offered me a beer but when I told her my life was complicated, she got mad at me and I think she hates me now and so does Joon.\" \"She doesn't hate you,\" said Sam, \"she's your sister.\" \"Well she does now.\" \"Not after we see her she won't.\" \"If she doesn't forgive me, I will understand and will even understand more if she doesn't want me in her life anymore since she has you now.\" Sam conked him in the head with his cane. \"What did you do that for?\" Benny asked. \"For feeling sorry for yourself. Get over it. She is not going to hate you for the rest of your life. I hated you when you threw me out but do I hate you now? No, so I doubt she will still hate you after she sees me with you and admitting to her you were wrong and let her grow up finally.\" \"Yeah, I will tell her she can try living on her own. What else did you do with her?\" Benny asked. \"Did you have sex? Did you kiss her? What else have you done with her?\" \"N-O-Y-B,\" Sam replied. \"What does that mean?\" \"None of your business.\" \"Fine fine. I hope you don't hurt her or I will be taking you to court.\" \"Chill, Benny. I won't.\" To Joon they went.

This story takes place in the middle of the movie where they are in the park and they come home. Sam, Joon, and Benny were all in the park that day. Sam loved old movies and loved Buster Keaton so he always dressed up like him. They went to the park that day and had a picnic and as they were leaving, Sam started to kick his hat making it look like it kept moving. Then he drew a crowd when he did his silent acts and Benny learned he wasn't so bad after all and he was talented. So as they were leaving the park that evening, Benny told them to go right ahead and he will be home soon. He had some thinking to do. Sam and Joon arrived home and put the stuff in the kitchen. Joon put her peanut butter back in the fridge. Joon went up to her room and took off her dress and put on her orange pants and a white t shirt. She brushed her teeth and hair. Down in the art studio, Sam took off his clothes and got his jamese on, a long white shirt that is and brushed his teeth in the powder room. Sam went back to the art studio and Joon came in. They both sat down and looked at each other. They both leaned closer and started to kiss. Then they stopped and smiled and started again. They made love that night and Sam felt he should tell Joon his secret. A problem he has always had and his mother would yell at him about it and humiliate him about it. Called him names. After they were done making love, Sam decided he better tell Joon before their relationship got any further. \"Joon?\" \"What?\" she said. \"I uh...I'm a...I'm a bed wetter.\" Joon giggled. Sam thought maybe it was a mistake he told her because she was laughing at him. \"I thought I could trust you with all my secrets because I love you.\" \"Me too,\" she said. \"I will keep it a secret if we make love again.\" Sam smiled. Then they heard the neighbor's dog barking and Benny coming inside. \"Don't tell Benny,\" she said. \"Okay,\" said Sam. Joon kissed him and left the studio grabbing her pants. She went up to her room and crawled into bed. Sam stared at the skylights in the art studio. Everyday he had been hiding his secret from Benny and Joon. He didn't wet the bed every night but it happened off and on. Luckily he hasn't had a night time accident since he has lived with them. But he still put puppy training pads under him on the couch when he go to sleep in case he had an accident. He couldn't risk Joon seeing the wet spot on her couch. When he lived with Mike, he had wet the bed and Mike got mad at him and made him sleep under the sink ever since. When he was a kid, his mother would yell at him every morning and tell him what a baby he is for not making it to the bathroom. She would make him sleep in his urinated sheets. She said they couldn't bring up the water bill because he is too lazy to get out of bed to use the bathroom so he would have to sleep in his urine stained sheets. Sam got off the couch and went to his bag and took out another puppy training pad and placed it on the couch. He lied on top of it. Now that Joon knew, the pressure of hiding it was off of him but what about Benny? That be another story. I have heard a rumor that Sam was supposed to tell Joon he is a bed wetter. Then I read in a magazine and there was an article about Johnny Depp. I read he wanted Sam to reveal his secret to Joon because he thought it be funny but the line was cut.

My husband knocked me up this summer two weeks after our honeymoon and we were both very excited but then we lost the baby. So please any women here reading this, I want women to talk too who have also miscarried so if you have miscarried I want to talk about it. I have a baby doll now that replaces our baby we lost. Lot of people are fore square against that because they think its unhealthy. Okay I am not going to bother with any character introductions this time. We have all seen the movie so we know Joon is sick, Sam is dyslexic and is obsessed with Buster Keaton and all and Ruthie is just starting to date Benny and he suffered from Over Protective Brother syndrome (a condition I made up as a joke for my other story) and we all know what jobs they have. If Sam Knocked Joon up Chapter 1 Joon had been living in her apartment for a week with Sam. She had not been feeling well lately. About a week after she was released from the hospital, her body had been acting funny. She had been feeling sick, having menstrual cramps but no period, her breast had been sore and her bras seemed to look smaller on her busts and her sense of smell seemed to be stronger and she had to go to the bathroom more often. She was still able to paint and read. Sam had noticed something different in her. She had been craving different food than celery and peanut butter and tapioca and her breakfast smoothie. Instead she asked for pickles and ice cream and her breasts felt different and her nipples looked like a different color. She had also been moody. Sam couldn't understand what was wrong with her. He thought he should talk to Benny but he was afraid of what if Benny thought it wasn't working out between them and she should be in a group home. Dr. Garvey would still be dropping by every week to check up on her living situation. Her living on her own was just a trial to see if it works out. Sam decided to talk to Ruthie instead. He left Joon alone with her painting. He knocked on her apartment door with his cane. Ruthie answered it. \"You're up early,\" she said. \"I need to talk,\" said Sam. \"Come on in,\" said Ruthie. Sam walked in and sat down. \"Do you want anything to drink?\" Ruthie asked. \"No, I'm fine,\" said Sam. \"Okay.\" Ruthie sat down. \"So....what's up?\" \"It's Joon,\" said Sam. \"She's been acting different.\" \"Really?\" Ruthie asked. \"In what way.\" \"Well for one, she has been craving different foods and she had been having pickles and ice cream for the past week, she has been more depressed or stressed lately, and she says she has been having her period cramps, and she's been sick lately.\" \"I know,\" said Ruthie. \"No I mean she feels like throwing up so she runs to the bathroom and she doesn't always vomit.\" \"Is there any chance she could be pregnant?\" Ruthie asked. Sam eyes widened. \"Pregnant? Really?\" \"Well when did you have sex?\" \"Last night,\" Sam replied. \"When did you first have it?\" \"The day we fell in love,\" Sam replied. \"But what day was that?\" \"Uh before she went to the hospital and we had sex the night before.\" \"Okay so she could be pregnant. Have you talked to her about that?\" \"No.\" \"I think you should.\" Sam got up. \"Okay, thank you Ruthie.\" \"You're welcome Sam.\" Sam left her apartment and came back to his. They lived across the hall from each other. \"Joon?\" Sam asked after he shut the door. Joon had some music playing. \"Joon, how are you feeling?\" Sam asked. \"Better now,\" she said. \"No cramping or feeling sick?\" Sam asked. \"My boobs still hurt but my bras help.\" \"Do you think you could be pregnant?\" Sam asked. Joon froze fast. \"Are you?\" Sam asked. \"My time of the month was due five days ago and it never came, maybe it's just late.\" \"Well I talked to Ruthie and she said you might be,\" said Sam. \"You talked to her about me?\" Joon shouted. \"She isn't a doctor or even a pregnancy test. Has she ever been pregnant before so how would she know I am or not?\" \"Joon, we had sex and have been having it since we've moved in here. She said I should talk to you about it.\" \"Why?\" Joon cried. \"Uh I don't know.\" Joon left their apartment and pounded on Ruthie's door. Ruthie answered it. \"You told him I was pregnant?\" Joon yelled. \"Shhhh don't yell,\" Ruthie said. \"No I did not tell him that, I asked if there was a chance that you were.\" \"I wanted it to be a surprise and my period can be late you know.\" \"When was it due?\" \"Five days ago.\" \"Joon, I think that's long enough. Maybe you should get a pregnancy test, there is a store down the street. I didn't know you wanted it to be a surprise, I'm sorry.\" \"You knew already?\" Sam asked Joon when he overheard. \"I wasn't sure,\" said Joon. \"I know preggies throw up and get sick when they are and my period never came yet.\" \"And you have been acting different,\" said Sam. \"Your boobs feel different and your nipples have been a different color.\" \"Come on, we can all head to the store for the test,\" said Ruthie. \"We gotta know now. Besides you are on medication and we don't know if that is going to hurt the baby.\" \"I was planning to abort it anyway,\" said Joon. \"What?\" said Sam. \"I don't want this baby.\" \"Joon, you might maybe change your mind and want it,\" said Ruthie. Joon was too upset to talk so Ruthie decided to go to the store anyway for the pregnancy test. \"Sam do you think you be okay alone with Joon?\" Ruthie asked. \"I'll be fine,\" said Sam. He decided to let Joon be because the last time he tried to calm her, she freaked out and the bus driver had to call 911 to get her off the bus and that was how she went to the hospital. He took her back to their apartment and let her be. Ever since Joon had been released from the hospital, they had been using condoms ever since so she wouldn't get pregnant but it might have been too late. She had not been feeling well and her body had been acting strange. She felt tired and rested in their bedroom. Sam decided to make her breakfast smoothie. He put in the Capt N Crunch, the peanut butter super chunks and the milk. Then he blended it and poured it in a cup and gave it to Joon. But she wasn't in the mood for it. Sam just set it on the stand next to their bed. - Ruthie bought a pack with two pregnancy tests in it and drove back to the apartment and parked it in the back where the garages were. She got out of her car and closed the garage door and went in the building. She knocked on Sam and Joon's door. Sam heard the knocking and answered it. \"Here is the test,\" Ruthie said as she handed it to Sam. Sam took it and looked at it. \"Do you know how it works?\" Ruthie asked. \"No,\" said Sam. \"There are instruction on the back. You can have Joon read them and have her take the test.\" Sam tried reading the back but it was very hard to understand but Joon had been showing him how to read. \"Will you let me know if it came out positive or negative?\" Ruthie asked. \"Sure,\" said Sam. Ruthie went back to her apartment to get ready for work as Sam closed the door. He went back to their bedroom. \"Joon, Ruthie got us the test.\" \"I don't want to take it,\" said Joon. \"Joon you have to, don't you want to know if you're pregnant.\" \"No because I don't want to have a baby.\" \"But you'd still be pregnant even if you didn't know you were,\" Sam pointed out. \"I hope I miscarry, that be so wonderful,\" said Joon. \"Maybe my pills will kill it.\" \"But I want to see the results, will you do it for me?\" Sam asked. \"Okay,\" she said. She took the box and read the back. \"Okay I'll take the test when I go to the bathroom again.\" \"Thanks,\" said Sam. Sam then started to get ready for work. He drank the breakfast smoothie Joon never had and brushed his teeth and hair and made sure his clothes looked neat and fine. \"Let me know what the results were when I get back,\" said Sam as he left. Joon sighed, \"Okay.\" She lied there resting. Then she felt she had to use the bathroom again so she ripped open the box and took out one of the strips. She took it to the bathroom and read the box and peed and did the test. Then she had to wait five minutes and then she looked at the results. She was not happy. Those period cramps Joon was having were her implatation cramps she was feeling. I never experianced nausea during my pregnancy so I was very lucky. Only 1 in 3 women get it. My boobs also have seemed to gone back to their normal size after I had the procedure. I had a missed abortion so I had to have my uterus cleaned out. I already knew I had miscarried after I had my first prenetal care. Next time I won't ignore my faded pregnancy symptoms until I have the baby.

If he had left sooner, if he hadn't stayed after, if he hadnrun home, if... If he had been there,nmaybe it wouldn't have happened. Fear shot up his spine, electrifyingnhis nerves. Sam doubled his pace; skipping stairs, praying Joon wasnokay. He almost tripped, but managed to fall to just one knee. Thenmetal edge of the step bit into his leg, through his pants. Henhissed, but didn't curse. That was another thing Sam was good at,nnot cursing. He brushed his hands off, ignoring the throbbing pain,nand resumed his journey. Sam pushed through thendoor of the stairwell, hopping slightly as he rounded the corner. Henskidded to a stop, almost loosing his hat, outside their apartment.nRuthie paced a bit nervously. Her usually calm red hair was pushed upnon one side, as she had been combing through it frantically. Hernusually collected face was pale and there were splotches on herncheeks. She stopped, and turned to face him. She said the one thingnSam dreaded hearing. \"It's Joon.\" There were many thingsnSam hated hearing. But, being told something was wrong with hisnJoon topped that list, easy. Ruthie kept talking. \"Benny's in therenright now. He's trying to calm her down, but I don't know if that'snhelping any. Sam, you might want to talk to her...\" She trailednoff as Benny opened the door slightly, poking his head out. Samnshrunk back slightly, afraid of getting hit. \"Come 'ere.\"nBenny jerked him into the familiar apartment by his shirt. Sam couldnhear Joon in her bedroom, crying. \"See if you can talk to her.\"nNodding slightly, Sam padded to her room with a slight limp, peekingnin. He knew she liked her privacy. On call of habit, he knockednsoftly against the doorframe, hoping to find a reaction to somethingnfamiliar. \"Joon? Joon Bug?\"nThe distressed girl rocked back and forth on her bed, silent, as shenheld her head. She didn't react, not an eyelid flutter, to thennickname. It was something she hated but loved being called. It wasnsomething only Sam could get away with calling her, because henunderstood. He knew what it was like to be different and teased. So if one shy eccentricnboy wanted to call her, a temperamental moody girl, after a bug foundnonly in summer, Joon could deal. Kneeling on the floor, Sam crept tonher bed and watched her, ignoring the complaints coming from his sorenknee. \"Are you okay?\" Still wary, Sam climbed onto her bed,nsitting across from her. He kept his voice soft and non-threatening.nHe hoped to pull her into his lap and stroke her hair. Soothe herndemons, so to speak. Joon scooted away fromnhis voice. She glared at him from between her fingers beforenreturning back to her distressed mantra of hums and whimpers.nFrowning slightly, he reached out to touch her shoulder, hesitantly.nShe jerked away, as if burned, and hissed in a harsh whisper. \"Don't touch me.\" ","Summary":" Don't touch me ellina HOPE Dedicated to mynreaders!

(MEANS: I don't own Benny and Joon) This is set in the movie,nbetween Sam and Joon's official hook-up and Benny's officialnfinding out of said hook-up. OoO The only thing Samntruly understood when he woke up was that it was late. He realized,nas a very close second, that Joon was kneeling in front of him andnhis couch, on the floor. She held one of his hands between hernsmaller ones and she stared up at him, unblinking. After over-comingnthe shock of seeing his girlfriend, Sam went back to the first issue. It was late. Very late,nas in nearly morning late. Had someone asked him for the exact timenat that moment, he would've only smiled nervously and shrugged.nThough, that would bring another question into consideration: wherenwould that someone come from? Perhaps they would've dropped out ofnthe ceiling. Or, maybe they could've broken a window and climbednin. Had Sam been thinkingnabout someone being dedicated enough to find out the time, henmight've been more helpful in that respect. More than likely, if henwas faced with a random person asking for the time late at night, henwould've acted very confused and very shy and very unhelpful. Whatnelse could one do? Sam didn't own a watchnor clock, and he hadn't really had the courage or felt the need tonask Benny for one. Sam didn't hold much money of his own, either. So,nthat ruled out the prospect of buying a clock. Not to mention, beingnfaced with a complete stranger late at night (in your own(borrowed?)nroom) didn't leave the brain very functional. The poor boy, havingnjust been pulled out a sleepy happiness, blinked. He squinted hisneyes in an attempt to adjust more to the darkness occupying his room.nSam started when he realized Joon's stare was slightly glazed andnreflective with stars shining in from the outside. Tears, Samnrationalized. Dull fear and panic followed this mental statement.nJoon had seemed happy at the park! She had laughed and evennparticipated a little in the show. He watched her carefully, tryingnto solve the puzzle that was his ladylove. She sniffled quietly,nwiping her eyes on the back of her hand, and offered a small smile.nSam sat up on his elbows, looking at his newly found sweetheartncuriously. He wasn't used to womennor their odd behavioral habits that he seemed to be encountering asnof late. They confused him almost as much as trying to figure out whynsomeone would ask him what time it was, when any normal someone wouldnbe asleep and uncaring to such trivial matters. For sleep is far morenimportant than time! While Sam was debating with his mind (a pastimenthat often took up more time than it was worth) Joon had made hernmove. Without a word, she climbed onto the couch, and he (havingnbroken out of his day(night?)dreams) hastily moved his legs to makenroom for her. Joon, however, had nonintention of just curling up like a cat or some other animal at itsnmaster's feet. And, Joon had no master. She laid down, her headnpillowed on Sam's chest. At first, he froze, not used to this type ofnthing, but eventually relaxed as he got comfortable. Instinctively,none arm hugged her waist, his hand resting innocently on her hip.nEverything Sam did held an innocent intent.

Summary: A one-shot story. Sam knows he wants to ask Joon to marry him. The question is, how? ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~ Sam knew. He knew more than anything. This is what he wanted. This is who he wanted. Her. He had never been so sure about anything in his life. All he knew is that whenever he was with her, everything was perfect. Joon. That was the love of his life. And a powerful one at that. More powerful than his love to make people smile. More powerful than his love for old time movies. And even more powerful than his love for Buster Keaton. And that's saying something. He couldn't describe it. All he knew was that if she were gone, a piece of him, and a big piece at that, would be gone as well. Without her, his life would be like having paint, but nothing to paint. Like having a movie, but nowhere to watch it. Like having good news, but no one to share it with. Without Joon, his life would be pointless. And that's exactly the reason Sam thanked his lucky star ( which he liked to think was Buster Keaton giving him advice and helping him along in life, silly, he knew, but it never hurt to pretend eh? ) everyday for bringing Joon into his life. Or more precisely, bringing him into hers. It was these thoughts that led Sam to where he was at the current moment, pacing back and forth in the front room of the apartment he shared with Joon. If he kept at this much longer he would surely wear a hole in the ground, of this he was sure, but he couldn't think about things like that now. No, he had more important things to conquer. Said things being one extremely important thing, how to propose to Joon. He had come to the conclusion he wanted to marry her about two weeks ago and quickly got down to business about it. First, he asked for Benny's permission and blessings. Benny had had a very serious look on his face which worried Sam, but soon enough Benny broke out into a wide grin and gave Sam a hand shake, a hug, and the two things that Sam had requested. He also gave the standard brotherly words of \" You hurt her, I'll kill you.\" , you know, the usual. Next Sam went ring shopping. He took Ruthie along with him for this, figuring she would know more about this kind of stuff than himself. Man, what a wild trip that was. The jeweler would show them some of his best quality jewels, and each time was meant by a shake of the head and a \" That's not good enough.\" from Sam. After what seemed an eternity of this routine, Sam finally found something that him and Ruthie both agreed on. There it was, it was perfect. So perfect in fact Sam had to pinch himself to assure himself he wasn't dreaming. It was a small, but not too small, round white pearl. It was simple, but beautiful in every aspect, exactly like Joon was. It was better than Sam could have hoped for. So Sam had permission, he had blessings, and he had the ring. All he needed now was a way of asking. He didn't want to just come right out and ask, that would be too boring. He wanted something more......special. Still pacing, Sam took his trusty cane and started twirling it around his hand like it was a baton. 'Think think think.' he thought to himself. He could have a plane write the proposal across the sky for her......no, too overly done. Maybe he could take her out to dinner and have a band sing the proposal to her......no, that would be too loud. Well there has to be something. Something simple, but special. Something that means something. Something that shows her I put a lot of heart and effort into it.............Oh! Sam immediately stopped pacing. He had it! By Joe he finally had it. The perfect proposal. As soon as Joon seen it she would know how much time and dedication went into it. Sam was so excited he set to work right away. This would take some time after all. Later that night, Sam walked into Joon's painting room, which is where he found her every night after dinner. Okay, it was now or never. \"Umm, Joon?\" Sam asked, nervousness evident in his voice. \"Yes?\" She replied while putting down her brush. \"I, I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Okay.\" Joon said, slightly confused by his sudden change in behavior. Sam walked over to Joon, stood right in front of her, bent down on one knee, and handed her a folded piece of paper. \"Here.\" Joon hesitantly took the piece of paper, all the while wondering what he was up to. She unfolded it and gasped when she seen what was inside. In what appeared to be a five year old's writing were the three words 'Merry me, please.' Joon couldn't believe it. Not only was he asking her to marry him, but he actually written the words himself. She knew how difficult that was for him and that in itself meant the world to her. This man, kneeling in front of her, meant the world to her. Joon gently lifted Sam's head towards her and gave him the word he had been dying to hear. \"Yes.\" \"Yes?\" Sam asked unbelievingly. \"Yes.\" That was all the reassurance he needed. He jumped up, grabbed her, and spun her around. That's it, she had officially just made him the happiest man alive.

I Think That I Shall Never See Trees had to be the coolest things in the world, Sam thought as he climbed. Not just because they offered shade, but because they were so perfect. Charlie Brown's Christmas tree had obviously been drawn by somebody who hated trees, because there was no such thing as an ugly tree. He agreed totally with the poet who'd said, \"I think that I shall never see, a poem as lovely as a tree.\" Trees had personalities, just like people. There were impressive towering redwoods that must be in the Who's Who of Trees, graceful willows which swayed like a mother rocking her baby, flirtatious palm trees with their fronds like cheerleaders' pompoms. There were coarse-textured trees whose bark really was worse than their bite, and sharp, prickly trees that warned \"Stay away from me.\" Sam preferred the more welcoming trees--there was nothing like a good oak for climbing. Not that there weren't all kinds of terrific trees in the world to climb! When he was ten, in Florida, he'd climbed a banyan tree with a tremendous cluster of trunks together that was bigger than the family car. Sam's father had threatened to leave him there if he hadn't come down from the bleep-bleep tree, and that was a tough call. The thing that decided Sam was the fact that they were going to Sea World the next day, and he really wanted to see the dolphins. Dolphins were pretty cool, and it turned out that the seals sounded just like his dad bellowing, which was pretty funny. (He knew better than to say that to his dad, though.) He never forgot climbing that gigantic banyan tree. It was the best part of the whole trip. That was definitely Sam's second favorite tree, ever. The very best tree Sam ever climbed was out behind Grandma Milly's house. There was a fork, about twenty feet up, that was shaped as if it had been grown just for him. Like God had placed that acorn in the ground and grown that tree for the sole purpose of giving him shelter. (He'd fallen asleep up there once, and gotten a thorough hiding afterward.) It was a mighty oak, and Sam remembered from the age of seven or so scrambling up its branches to hide from his cousins during family gatherings. The older cousins picked on him, the little ones squealed like puppies, and the only one who was his age was his so-perfect cousin, Mary Sue. Catch her climbing a tree? He settled down onto a comfortable branch. No way. She never did anything that might make a mess of her perfect clothes or her perfect hair. Sam always had scrapes somewhere--knees and elbows, mostly--and his clothes were always patched. His mother, who had to patch them, said with exasperation that she should have called him Charlie after the Little Tramp, since he always looked like a ragged hobo. Sam finally got around to seeing one of the Little Tramp's old movies - just so he'd know what he was being accused of - and that had led him to the second coolest thing in the world, after trees. And maybe dolphins - or should he have them on a separate list, like the coolest things in the water? Or should he just say the coolest person? No question: Buster Keaton. He liked Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd was all right, too, but Buster Keaton was just It. One of the back-to-back movie channels was showing Silent Stars of the Silver Screen one Saturday afternoon, and there was a Buster Keaton comedy on after \"City Lights\". Twelve-year old Sam sat on the plaid couch with his mouth hanging open, watching this guy in a neat hat do all kinds of amazing gags. That was the day everything changed. Before that, he brought home notes that said things like: \"Sam daydreams in class too much. He won't participate.\" After he discovered Keaton, though, the notes were different, more urgent: \"Disrupts the class with his antics. Won't settle down.\" - \"Sam's clowning has to stop; it is interfering with his classwork.\" Or Sam's particular favorite, from his tenth-grade Social Studies teacher: \"Somewhere, a village is missing an idiot. I suggest you send Sam there.\" That was kind of funny. Who would've thought Miss Kincaid had a sense of humor like that? (Of course, that was just before she Went Away For A Long Rest, and Sam never got to find out if she'd meant it as a joke, since he dropped out of school a couple months later.) Since then, he'd spent a dozen years drifting from one job to another. It wasn't easy getting work when reading and writing were involved...printed words were Sam's enemy. They were sneaky. Their shapes seemed to twist as he looked at them; he could usually figure out what something meant if he had a chance to look at it without distraction, but most of the time, that wasn't good enough. So, he cleared tables or did yard work, but the great thing about it was, you could do that anywhere. Maybe he really was the hobo his mother always said he looked like, but Sam traveled, and climbed trees all over the country. This particular tree was beside his cousin Mike's house. Mike wasn't his favorite cousin - he said mean things about Sam sometimes - but at least Sam had a place to crash while he saved up a little money to take him to the next place he hadn't seen. He wasn't sure was he was looking for, and he hoped he'd know it if he saw it. It had to be something as unique as a tree, as amazing as Keaton - how could he not recognize something like that? Although Sam wasn't too crazy about Mike, his tree was pretty nice. And another cool thing was, Mike's house was right by some train tracks, so he could watch the trains rumble past, making the tree shiver and rattling the windows in the old, white house. Another train was coming soon - he could hear it, maybe a mile away. A car approached the tracks from the other side, and just made it past as the gates were coming down. The black car eased down the street as Sam watched. He didn't know a lot about cars, but it was one of those things that looked like a station wagon was fooling around with a pickup truck and this was their offspring. As it came closer, he could see the person in the passenger seat was wearing a white motorcycle helmet. (Geez, and Mike thought Sam was an oddball!) What was even more surprising, she - he was pretty sure it was a girl, unless it was a guy with long hair wearing a blue dress and a helmet - the passenger - actually noticed him. People hardly ever looked up into trees, he knew. Sam had once spent several embarrassing-but-educational hours up an elm tree while a couple picnicked below him. But Helmet Girl looked squarely at him as the car went past, and he wondered if she climbed trees, too. ","Summary":" Standard disclaimer: No, I don't own it.

You desperately need a job, so you sign up at a labor ready. You fill out some paper work. You put in your name and address, date of birth, your past employment and you list your skills and interests. Your interests are: Mental Health Computers Swimming Skiing Video Games Reading Your Skills are: Efficient Hard worker Fast learner Then you list your experience. You can clean, cook, organize, paint buildings or billboards, work at a cash register, sort the files, take care of children, and you list you volunteered in a group home. After you are done filling out the paper work, you turn it in and they say they will call you. You are still living at home with your family. You hate it because they all drive you crazy. They leave things in the wrong spot, they don't pick up after themselves, your brothers do parties from time to time, you don't like them or or their friends being in your personal space which is the whole basement, you hate the noise your family makes but luckily they leave you space and leave you to your routines and don't bug you for unexpected things unless it's an emergency or something urgent. You have never had a boyfriend and you are young. You have been working to save money for your own apartment but you are expected to help pay for school. You have gone for childcare and cooking and looking to be a teacher. You have worked through the school in the file room. Now it's summer and school is out. You have Asperger's syndrome and don't even know it. You have never been diagnosed or ever heard of it. You have been labeled with other things instead and you are no longer on medication because you didn't like being drugged. You felt they didn't help. You have always known you were different but never understood why so you figured it was the way you were treated. Now you are aware of all these labels you have had and your past problems. Your family has no idea why you are different or why some things are an issue for you that aren't to them. Your parents have done their best to understand you over the years and seeking you help and helping you get a job. You have done some volunteer work in high school and middle school to try and fit in and be normal but kids could never appreciate you. So you have given up but that didn't stop you from getting a job or going to school. You had worked very hard to get this far. * * * A whole week has passed and you have applied at a few places but still no phone call for a job interview. But your mother wakes you up one day with the phone. \"Who is it?\" you ask. \"Something from labor ready,\" she says. You take the phone from her and say \"Hello?\" Mom leaves your bedroom. \"Hi this is Cheryl from Labor Ready and we have found an opening,\" Cheryl says. \"Someone name Benny Pearl needs a housekeeper and he has a sick sister who needs to be watched. She has a mental illness and need supervision.\" \"What does she have?\" you ask. \"I have no idea,\" Cheryl says. \"This job will start today and you would need to be there by eight.I know it's short notice-\" You get excited because this is interesting and you're dying to meet her and get know her and see what kind of illness she has. \"I'll take it,\" you say interrupting. \"You will?\" Cheryl says. \"Great. His address is North 301 Cedar Street Spokane Washington and his phone number is for in case you need directions.\" You get all excited. You get out of bed and write it down. Then you hang up and call Benny and tell him you are the new housekeeper and you need to know how to get there. He gives you directions and you know where the downtown is and you know Maple Street Bridge so you get dressed, brush your hair and teeth and grab a package of two pop tarts and you gather up some of your stuff that keeps you company. You generally dislike change and unexpected things but this was different. You got a job and you were expecting you be working any day for labor ready. You tell your mom the exciting news. She is happy for you. You head on over to Benny's. * * * You arrive in a cute neighborhood that is right by downtown Spokane and is along Spokane River. The Maple Street Bridge crosses over the neighborhood and you wonder how can people stand the noise of traffic crossing over. You see the ugly green house and notice there is a sun room built onto it. You park your car and get out and notice you can hardly hear the traffic on the bridge. You get your stuff and lock your car and you go up to the door. You ring the doorbell and then you see the other front door opens, there you see a woman who looks to be in her early twenties. She isn't that much older than you. She has on a sundress and has shoulder length light brown hair and she isn't that tall. She is only three inches shorter than you and she has some paint on her hands and arms. \"You must be the new Smail,\" she says. \"What?\" you ask. \"You look young for a Smail,\" she says. \"Not much older than I am.\" \"What's a Smail?\" you ask. She doesn't answer and then the guy comes to the door and says you must be you and he asks how old you are. You tell him and then he introduces himself as Benny and introduces the woman as his little sister Joon. Benny looks to be in about his late twenties or early thirties. \"That was fast,\" Joon tells Benny. \"You alreay got a new one and you get someone who isn't even that much older than I am.\" \"Joon,\" says Benny. You ask, \"Is she the sick one?\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"I'll tell you about it.\" He invites you inside and while Joon goes in her sun room, Benny tells you about how crazy she is. \"She is mentally ill and if she runs hot and cold on you, don't worry about it. Just ignore it. Just let her go her routine, she likes them and if anything happens that interrupts her pattern, she flips out and it is not a pretty situation. Don't let her wander off, and one more thing, if she starts talking to herself, just ignore it. She sometimes hears voices in her head and that comes with the territory and make sure that nothing happens to her.\" \"Okay,\" you say understanding the thing for routine. Then you ask, \"Does she have schizophrenia?\" \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Well, I need to get to work so call me if there are any problems.\" \"What work do I do?\" you ask. \"You don't have to worry about it but if you want to clean, you can. All I need is someone to watch her. It does help when you clean because I am busy with my job. It's great to come home to relax and not have to clean as much.\" You are unaware that Benny doesn't really trust you with his sister because of your young age and he prefers older people, not someone who has only been an adult for a few years. After all, you look like a teenager. Benny leaves you his phone number and then leaves but he forgets to tell you something. You feel like a baby sitter than a housekeeper. You find it odd he would call someone a housekeeper than house sitter or baby sitter. After all, you are watching his sister. You wander in the sun room and see it's more like an art studio. Doorknobs hanging on the ceiling, art portraits everywhere lined up against the wall, some windows are painted, you see a desk in there with a chair, a couch and of course Joon painting. There is even some dried up paint on the floor and you see the art supplies, paint cans, paintbrushes, art tools, rolled up paper and then Joon sighs. She sighs again and starts to pace and keeps sighing. You are unaware why she is doing it. You figure it's her schizophrenia. You start to touch things. You feel her artwork and then she throws something at you but misses. Then you feel her painting she is working on and Joon screams as she kicks the chair, \"Get the heck out!\" You jump and run out in a flash closing the door behind you. That was what Benny forgot to tell you about, do not hang out in her room while she is painting, she hates it. You see the house is a mess so you decide to start cleaning. It's driving you crazy. You have no idea where to start. You decide to start with the dishes. Joon comes and sees you and gives you the silent treatment as she watches. It makes you nervous. \"What?\" you ask. She doesn't answer. She just keeps her arms folded and taps her foot. Then you pick up a cup and it slips out of your hand and it drops on the floor and breaks. Joon starts shrieking at you. She's found a few reasons to dislike you. One: You're her peer. Two: Your hair looks out of place even though you had brushed it this morning. Three: You talk funny according to her. Four: You don't give very good eye contact so you were unfriendly according to her. Five: You're a careless person because you broke that cup. Six: You're too loud because of the dishes. You jump and say it was just an accident and you will clean it up. She tells you to leave them alone and get out of her sight. You run out of the kitchen and up the stairs. You think she is one sick nasty person. You see Joon's room and notice she has a queen bed and lot of books and dolls on the shelf and some other toys. You see some photo frames on the stand next to her bed. You look at them and see a picture of their parents and of Benny and Joon from when they were kids. Joon's facial expression looks different like she isn't there, you could see it in her eyes. You would guess Benny looked to be about seven or eight and Joon about three or four years old in the picture. Then you go in Benny's room and see he has a goldfish and he has a phone in there. You pick it up and dial the number Benny gave you. Someone picks up. \"Hello?\" \"Hi is Benny there?\" you say. \"Benny, some lady is on the phone,\" you hear him call. You hear clanging in the background and some machine going off and then \"Hello?\" says Benny. \"Joon is yelling at me,\" you say. \"I told you to just ignore it,\" he says. \"But I didn't do anything. She yelled at me when she saw me in the sunroom.\" \"Oh don't go in there while she is painting,\" Benny says. \"She hates that.\" \"And she got mad at me when I tried to do the dishes,\" you say. \"Don't worry about the dishes,\" says Benny. \"She will run hot and cold on you.\" You finally ask what that means since idioms is something you have troubles with. \"She will be sweet and calm and then next thing she is screaming at you,\" Benny replies. \"Oh,\" you say. Then you thank him and tell him bye and Benny says he will see you soon at six. You hang up and realize this was not the job you expected. You weren't expecting to watch some mental case who gets spiteful for no reason. Okay what happens next? Do you quit or do you stay because you are no quitter? You don't get to choose, I do. Stay tuned for the next chapter.[Chapter 2] If you picked that you quit, well that would have ended the story because you get another job from labor ready and it's at the Emma Sherman Memorial hospital where Joon was at in the movie. You get beaten to death by a insane patient who escaped from the closed ward. Plenty of crazy things will happen in this story. This chapter is short this time because you know how short some chapters are or parts when you pick your own adventure? I Really Need a Job and I Am No Quitter Chapter 2 You feel like quitting but you are the kind of person who doesn't like to give up. You will try and find a way to reason with Joon. You spend the rest of your time in the living room reading and then you hear Joon go outside. You put your book down and go after her. You see Joon walking down the street. \"Joon get back here,\" you say. She keeps walking. You run after her and tell her to get back in the house. She still doesn't answer so you grab her and she starts screaming and throwing a fit trying to push you off. But you keep grabbing her telling her Benny wants her to stay home and you keep pulling her. Joon gives up eventually and you pull her back in the house like she is a little kid. \"What the heck do you think you're doing?\" she yells. \"Benny doesn't want you to leave the house,\" you say. She yells, \"I am not stupid, I can go down the block.\" \"You say, \"I didn't think you were. I am just following your brother's orders.\" \"You're not my father or mother,\" she yells. \"Okay,\" you say. \"How about we both go together?\" \"No,\" she yells and storms to her studio and slams the door. You call Benny on the phone and tell her she tried to leave the house and said you weren't her mother or father. \"Well, son of a gun, I'll be over there shortly,\" he says. \"Gosh darn it.\" He hangs up and you wait. But it takes more than ten minutes for him to get home. When he gets home, he asks where Joon is and you say she is in the sun room. \"It's art studio,\" he corrects you. \"She hates it when you call it something else.\" He knocks on the door. \"Go away,\" she yells. \"It's Benny,\" he says. \"Go away,\" Joon yells again. \"I'm coming in anyway,\" he opens the door and walks in. You see Joon had already cleaned up the mess from the broken cup. \"We need to talk,\" Benny says. Joon takes off her shoe and throws it at Benny and sits near the window. \"I hate that housekeeper, she touches everything and is too loud.\" Benny ignores the shoe that was thrown at her. \"How is she loud?\" he asks. Joon doesn't answer. \"Tell me Joon.\" \"She does the dishes but is careless. She broke a cup,\" Joon replies. \"Well accidents happen. I have broken something too you know. Remember the time I was having my coffee and I accidentally spilled it?\" Joon smiles. \"You see? You didn't hate me for that,\" he says. \"No but she seems to be deliberately noisy and she touches my things.\" \"Dishes are noisy Joon. You can't do them quietly. What things of yours did she touch?\" \"My artwork,\" she says. \"Okay. That was my fault then. I forgot to tell her to not touch your things and she knows to not come in here. I told her that on the phone when she called.\" Joon doesn't say a word. \"Okay, I will get back to work and I don't want to get another phone call from the housekeeper.\" \"I have a name,\" you shout from the kitchen. Joon doesn't respond Benny leaves the art studio and tells you she is fine now and not to touch anything in her studio and not to go in there. He also tells you to not do the dishes because Joon has a problem with you dropping the cup. \"Okay,\" you say. Benny leaves. * * * In the neighborhood park nearby, a local band sets up and there are gates around the park and people have to pay to get in. The band starts up and it is very loud. There is lot of base, and heavy metal and it is bothering Joon. She is very sneaky so she sneaks out of the house and you don't even hear her leave because you are too preoccupied with your book. Drive in theaters is your obsession so you are too busy looking at pictures of them in the book and reading about them. Okay, are you going to notice she has snuck out or not? Stay tuned.

Well now, I know I said that my Benny and Joon story was only going to be a one shot kind of deal, but after a couple of people said I should do some kind of follow up, I decided eh, why the hell not. So that's why I'm back. I'm thinking this is going to be a three chapter thing. One chapter to serve as a update kind of thing that tells what's been going on, one for the wedding, and one for the honeymoon (don't let your mind take you to the gutter now, we ARE talking about Sam and Joon.) So, without further delay, here is the first chapter. Disclaimer: I own nothing to do with the movie Benny and Joon. The actors, characters, nothing. Just my Sam inspired outfit and my dvd. -------------------------------------------------- It had finally come. An event three years in the making. An event that took two months to plan. An event that had everyone so happy and nervous they didn't know whether to laugh, cry or both. But no matter what they decided on nothing could take away the excitement that filled the air. Because for the five people involved, and of course the five guests, this was the biggest event of the year. Yes, the big day had finally come...................Sam and Joon's wedding day. The planning for said event was nothing short of.............interesting, to say the least. First was finding the location. While Sam personally wanted the wedding to be held at the spot where they first techniqually met, (at the tree) Joon fought tooth and nail to have it at the park. In the end, they came to the mutual agreement to have the wedding at Benny's house and the reception at the diner. Next on the agenda was catering and decorations.. These decisions were made much more easily. As far as food went, they would have bowls of tapioca pudding, no raisins, dear god no raisins! And for refreshments, coke. Simple as pie. And since they already had a nice location, being the back of the house down by the river, all they really needed was an arch way, which Ruthie took care of. She even got stepping stones to serve as the walkway to the arch to add a special little touch. Then came the clothing situation. Sam was no problem. In fact, even before he asked Joon to marry him, he was already set to wear his favorite suspenders, his black blazer, his oh so spiffy black top hat, and of course, the most important piece of all, his beloved Buster Keaton cane. There was just no questions about it. But Joon, on the other hand, was a wee bit more difficult. She wanted to wear her favorite white, floral print dress, which wasn't the issue. It was the fact that she wanted to wear her snorkel mask as well that had her and Ruthie bickering day and night about. Ruthie's argument was that she should not wear it so Sam would be able to see her pretty eyes and face better. And Joon's argument was it was her wedding and she wanted the snorkel mask. After much debate the final verdict went to Benny, who felt it only fair that Joon should wear whatever she wanted, since it was infact HER wedding. With that out of the way, the only thing left was the guest list. This was probably the simplest thing there was to do. There would be Sam and Joon, which Sam made sure Benny wrote down first in big bold letters so nobody forgot. Benny and Ruthie would be there to serve as best man and maid of honor. Eric and his wife, Thomas and Joon's doctor would also be in attendance. And last but certainly not least, Sam's boss from the video store would be serving as the minister. He went online to get certified and everything. So everything was set. Now all they needed was to walk down the aisle and take the plunge into itemhood. A/N: Kinda crappy, I know, but the next two chapters where we actually get into the story will be better.[Chapter 2] A/N: Hey everybody. Just real quick before you continue reading, I want to do something I've never done before, an authur's thanks! CharlieMalfoy: I agree, snorkel masks should replace veils! Fealin/Robin: Thanks! I'm always scared I don't have the characters in.........well, character. And I think you should try to make your own version, there can never be enough Benny and Joon stories. Isabela Pucini: Wow. Your favorites? Thanks :) Livvy Depp: Thanks very much sugarbutt! Thanks to all my reviewers! You guys rock! It was an absolutely gorgeous day. The sun was shining bright, but it wasn't hot thanks to the generous breeze coming in from the west. The sky was littered with white fluffy clouds, and yet the sky was still clear. The birds were chirping, cliche as that was, and the four guests, including Sam's boss who was posing as the minister bringing the grand total to five, were all seated in the backyard waiting for the ceremony to begin. All this was happening while the bride and groom were both in their respective ends of the house. They were both firm believers that it was bad luck to see eachother before the wedding and they definitely did not want to start off their marriage on the wrong foot. So, Ruthie stayed with Joon and helped her get ready while Benny kept Sam together, because he was currently close to having a nervous breakdown. \"What if she changes her mind and runs away?\" Sam asked with a hint of terror in his voice while he nervously paced back and forth around the room. Benny sighed for what must have been the hundredth time that day. They had been going through this all morning but he just couldn't get through to Sam. \"She's not going t \" Benny stopped short so he could grab Sam and sit him down before his pacing drove him mad. \"She's not going to run away, alright.\" Sam nodded then went silent. \"But...............what if she does?!\" Sam made to get up again but Benny caught his arm and held him down before he could. \"She won't.\" he stated sternly. \"Positive?\" \"Positive.\" and with the final reassurance, Sam decided to just stay put for the time being. But being still was making him restless so he decided to keep his mind occupied by swirling his cane around, barely missing Benny's head in the process. And with that, Sam moved away from Benny to avoid the stern look that was being sent his way. Meanwhile.......... \"Wha ift e uns awae?!\" Joon managed to muffle through her snorkel mask. \"Sweetie, he's not going to run away. He loves you too much to even think of doing such a thing.\" Ruthie told her in a gentle, very much welcomed tone. \"Possitived?\" \"Positive. Now,\" Ruthie got up from her position on the floor where she was fixing the hem on Joon's dress. \"Are you ready to go marry your prince charming?\" Ruthie asked with a bright smile, which was met with a vigorous nod from Joon. \"Good, lets go get you married then.\" Down By The Lake.......... Sam was standing under the archway waiting for Ruthie to arrive, and for Benny to come and give Joon away to him. He was still shaking his wobbly cane nervously. Before long Ruthie came out and took her place on the opposite side of him, and singling that everything was ready. The wedding march started, courtesy of a plastic toy flute played by Eric, which gave Benny and Joon the cue they were so anxiously waiting for. \"Ready?\" Benny asked her. \"Eady.\" came her once again, muffled reply. And so, they started their walk down the step stones. Everybody stood as the two walked down. Sam's wobbling cane instantly stopped as soon as he seen his bride to be. His mouth went agape and he knew he would never be able to describe what he was feeling at this moment. And unbeknownst to him, Joon was thinking the exact same thing as she was watching him get closer and closer until finally, they arrived under the archway. Benny unhooked his arm from hers, gave her a quick peck on the cheek, and took his place next to Sam. He gave Eric a little nod, letting him know to stop. \"You look..........pretty.\" Sam couldn't help but whisper to Joon. \"ou too.\" Joon smiled back at him. The minister cleared his throat and began. \"We are gathered here today to join these two people in marriage. If anyone has any objections, speak now or forever hold your words.\" \"I OBJECT!\" Eric suddenly stood up and yelled. \"WHAT?!?!\" everyone turned to him with looks of complete and utter shock on their faces, only to see Eric start cracking up. \"I'm just kidding!\" this earned him some very relieved looks, and of course a slap over the head from his wife. \"Oh c'mon, that was funny.\" \"Just keep going.\" Benny told the minister. \"Ohhh, ummmmm.............. right then.\" he then proceeded to tell Sam and Joon to recite the vowels. This is where everyone started to get a little choked up. Expecially Sam and Joon, who just couldn't believe how lucky they were to have found eachother. At one point, Joon even reached up to wipe a tear off of Sam's cheek, and Sam tired to wipe the fog from Joon's snorkel mask, but then realized that it was fogging up from the inside. \"Then, with the power given to me by the almighty internet, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations.\" he shut his bible and began clap for the newlyweds, but then noticed the stares everyone was giving him. \"What?\" \"Uhhh, aren't you forgetting something?\" it was Ruthie who pointed this fact out. \"Huh? Oh!\" he now remembered. Again, he cleared his throat. \"You may now kiss the bride.\" he said with a very satisfied smile on his face. Sam and Joon turned to eachother once again and smiled. Sam pulled the mouthpiece out of Joon's mouth and gave her a sweet little peck, seeing as how Benny was there and all. They embraced eachother in an intimate hug much like the way they had when Joon was released from the hospital. Everyone clapped happily as the blithesome couple walked back up to the house and to the car in the front and headed for the diner with everyone else on their tails. Afterall, it was time to party! A/N: Well, I hope you all like. I know the whole speech from the minister was waaaaay off from the traditional version, but we must remember, he's not a professional, so he was just kinda winging it. Anyways, let me know what yall think. Oh, and real quick again, the name of this chapter, for those of you who don't know, is a refference to the song \"Chapel of Love\" by Bette Midler. Awesome song.[Chapter 3] A/N: This chapter will contain some fluff. Ahhhhh fluff, can't live without the stuff. Oh, and once again real quick, author's thanks! (They're quite fun!) Isabela Pucini: Goodie! I was hoping you would :) Lykcosdracos: Oh my! Snoopy Dances, for me?! Why my dear, you shouldn't have. blushes Yes I agree, they are perfect for eachother. And yes! Drinks all around! Livvy Depp: Thanks very much. Details are very important, so I'm very pleased to hear you like mine.....sugarbutt! :) Neo-moose: First off, love that name! Wowie, a sequel eh? You really think I'm capable. You're too kind. :) Vanillafluffy: Yes, raisins are the pit of all evil. (But I do love them so.....shhhhh, don't tell them!) As always, you guys are the best sooo..........Sam and Joon cookies all around, plus those drinks that Lykcosdracos mentioned. --------------------------- Everybody had a ball at the diner. Sam and Joon had their first dance to 500 Miles by The Proclaimers , (so sorry, I couldn't help it!) Benny and Ruthie each made individual speeches for the happy couple, and Sam even put on a great show with his Chaplin routine. And by at the end of the night, there was a great send off which included rice and sparklers. It was the perfect ending to the perfect day. It was around nine p.m by the time Sam and Joon got home to their apartment in Ruthie's building. They had decided instead of having a big , fancy honeymoon in some exotic place, all they needed was to be together. And thus they settled for spending the weekend alone in their apartment. They were just about to walk through the front door when Sam suddenly put his cane in front of Joon to stop her. She game him a quizzical look, but he just took off his hat, gave a slight bow, put it back on her head, and lifted her up princess style. \"It's tradition to carry the bride over the threshold.\" he told her, which earned him a smile from her in return. After he carried her in he gently put her down and shut and lock the door. (safety first kids) \"I have a surprise for you.\" Sam said shyly. \"What is it?\" Joon asked with a childish glint in her eye. \"Ummm, you have to put this on first.\" he pulled a handkerchief from his shirt pocket and tied it around her eyes. \"Ok............um, ok.\" Joon was a little nervous to say the least, she had no idea what he was up to. Sam led her excitedly to the bedroom. He positioned her facing towards the bed, dusted himself off a little so he would look his best, and started untying the handkerchief. \"Okay, surprise.\" Joon looked at the sight before her and was stunned silent. Sam had set up a whole romantic picture for her eyes. The bed was covered with pink rose petals (her favorite) little lamps in the shape of candles (he didn't want the house to burn down now.) and there was even a bowel of tapioca pudding, minus the raisins, waiting for them. \"Oh Sam, it's..............perfect.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah.\" Joon turned around so she could face Sam. She reached up to cup his cheek and gently kissed him. After pulling away, Joon smiled up at Sam once again for what must have been the hundredth time that day. But she couldn't help it. Sam just made her so happy she was constantly finding it harder and harder to remember a time in her life without him, and she was looking forward to spending years and years with him. The song was right, first comes love, then comes marriage, and hopefully soon there would be little Sams and Joons in baby carriages. Sam took a step away from Joon and pulled her towards the bed with him. He laid down and waited as she positioned herself in the crook of his arm and rested her head on his shoulder. He could truly say that he had never been as content in life as he was right now. Right now, life was just...........right. \"This is nice.\" he whispered into her hair. \"Yes.\" she agreed. And so the happy coupled stayed that way for the remainder of the night. Wrapped in eachother's loving arms, the way they would every night for decades to come. The End. A/N: And so concludes this little story. Just a couple of little things I need to point out and then I'll let you all be. First off, I know there was a love scene in the movie, but it just seemed right to not have one on the honeymoon. They just don't seem the type of couple to do that to me. I could be wrong though, but oh well. Secondly, I just had to add the 'K-I-S-S-I-N-G' song reference! It seemed to fit. And thirdly, for those of you who don't know, the line 'this is nice' I got from the movie Punch Drunk Love . Well that's all, thanks again to all my reviewers, you guys spoil me so! But I love you all. Ta! ","Summary":" A/N: Helloooooo everybody.

Love, gratitude and lots of raisin-free tapioca! Chapters 2 & 3 will appear over the next two nights--enjoy! Bah, humbug! -- I don't own any of it![Chapter 2] Chapter Two Rex Wrecks Rex was the perfect name for Allison's little monster, Juniper Pearl had decided by nine-thirty the following morning. Although Sam had hastily assured her that they only had to keep him until the Thursday meeting, that was a whole twenty-nine hours and forty-two minutes from now, and she already understood why her friend had gambled the baby. He howled and threw things and broke things and unlike a puppy of a similar age, wasn't even house-broken yet. At least Micki's pups were almost paper-trained, and they were only three months old. Good grief, it was no wonder poor Allison had come down with post-partum depression. (On top of regular manic-depression, which was bad enough.) Joon was trying to wipe up the remains of the bowl of tapioca she'd been trying to feed Rex, while he crawled around the kitchen. Apparently, the infant didn't care for tapioca. Still, there was no reason for him to fling it all over Sam's nice clean floor. Okay, there had to be some way to keep it--him--amused. Think, Joon. Allison hadn't sent any toys--just the diaper bag with basic supplies and a couple changes of clothing. Fingerpaints, she thought, inspired. That way, we can both do something artistic and it won't matter if he makes a mess. Two chaotic hours later, Joon had changed her mind. There was fingerpaint everywhere--on her, on Rex, on the floor, the walls, the sofa--almost everywhere except the sheet of paper Rex was supposed to be painting. As soon as she first dipped one of his baby hands in paint, he'd put the hand in his mouth, and spat the bright green paint out all over himself. She'd grabbed a damp paper towel to wash his face, and as she was doing that, he'd started crawling across the floor, leaving green handprints in his wake. While she was wiping the handprints, he'd gone back to the paint and tossed the recycled frozen dinner tray across the room--now the kitchen was an abstract scene in red, yellow and green. Sam was going to have a fit when he saw the now-multi-colored dishtowels. Joon got the paint cleaned up as best she could and tried to rinse the stained towels in the sink. Concentrating on that, she turned her back on Rex just long enough for him to crawl behind her. When she took a step back, holding the towel up to see how much of the paint had come out, she tripped over him and fell flat on her back. Then she smelled it. Oh, marvelous, another odiferous diaper to deal with! In seconds, they were both sobbing. \"What in the world?\" asked a woman's voice, and Joon looked up to see Ruthie, her neighbor and best girlfriend in the whole world. \"Joon Pearl, where did you get that baby?\" She swooped down and picked up the wailing Rex and tickled him into a sunny smile. \"He likes you!\" Joon said, surprised. Her friendly landlady must have heard the commotion and used her key. \"Joon--who does he belong to?\" \"My friend Allison. We're entertaining him until Thursday, but what I really wanted was a puppy.\" She blurted out the whole story as Ruthie expertly changed Rex. \"How do you know how to do that, Ruthie? You don't have any babies.\" \"No, but I had four younger brothers and sisters.\" With Ruthie to help, the next few hours didn't go too badly. Although it was noisy, banging on an old pot with a wooden spoon kept Rex happy for quite a while. Her friend was able to offer Joon advice about what would--and wouldn't--be a good idea to feed the infant, and gave her some tips on the best ways to take care of diapers and bath time. At three o'clock, Ruthie had to go get ready for the dinner shift at the diner, but by then, Joon felt much more confident. After all, Sam would be coming home in a little over an hour, and Rex was napping, actually asleep and quiet and not moving. He'd fallen asleep on the area rug, hugging one of Joon's bunny slippers. Sam still had the infant seat strapped into his car, so she couldn't tuck Rex into that, but he seemed to be okay where he was. Finally, she had some time to herself! Joon sat down in her favorite chair and began applying white glue and purple glitter to an old coffee can she'd painted pink. When the glitter dried, she had some lovely silver sequins to add to the project...a crash and shrill shreiking interrupted her as she planned sequin placement. Rex was awake, and in her preoccupation with her work of art, she hadn't noticed him crawling toward the ironing board. Now, the iron lay on the kitchen floor, and the baby was red-faced and screaming. Joon felt a wave of panic wash over her. The tv tray toppled over as she ran into the kitchen to see if the iron had actually struck him or just scared him. \"Just scared him,\" she decided with relief a moment later, holding the squirming baby, who began to calm down as she hugged him. \"That scared me, too,\" she said to him. \"I'd be in so much trouble if anything happened to you.\" Rex had his fist in his mouth again, and was looking back at her. His soft, curly hair was the color of corn silk and his eyes were big and blue. He was rather charming, now that he wasn't emitting an appalling amount of noise, soiling himself, or otherwise making a mess. In fact, the only mess in sight at the moment was the one Joon herself had made charging to the rescue. Well, she knew better than to put him down to try to clean it up. Shifting him around experimentally, she discovered what women have known for ages--the ability to single-handedly do a task with a baby perched on one hip. When Sam came in and looked at her anxiously, Joon smiled. The apartment was almost as clean as when he'd left that morning--and he was better at domestic stuff, anyway. The important thing was, little Rex was okay, Sam was home, and there were only twenty-one hours and sixteen minutes to go before Allison again took charge of her baby.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three Buster Sam thought Mr. Griner deserved a \"Boss of the Year\" award or something. The owner of the video store had said okay when Sam asked permission for an extra-long lunch and okay when Sam hesitantly asked if it would be all right for him to bring a child into the store during the morning hours. Usually, before noon, most of the store's business was drop-offs anyway. Of course, Sam left out Rex's age and how he came to be visiting Sam and Joon. Mr. Griner thought the couple was doing a favor for friend of Joon's who had the flu--well, at least part of the story was true. With one thing and another, it took longer than usual for Sam to complete his daily routine. While Sam vacuumed the aisles farthest from the counter, Rex pulled over a life-sized cardboard cutout of a spandex-wrapped action star toting two gigantic plasma cannons. Returning to the front of the store, Sam found his charge happily gnawing the star's silver-clad ankle. \"Nice going, Rex,\" he complimented the kid. \"You just did what an alien army ten thousand strong failed to do. I'm impressed.\" The display had been looking a bit past its prime, anyway, and Sam figured when Rex was through teething on it, it could go out to the dumpster, no great loss. Rex chuckled as Sam went through his Keaton routines. The baby was an undemanding audience; he watched the show, beat on the cutout with his chubby fists and gurgled gleefully. A couple regular customers came in with their tapes, most of them wondering if Sam was that adorable little baby's Daddy. He managed a smile at that; he could safely say without hesitation that he wasn't, just a helpful friend. The hours from nine to one had never passed so slowly before; by now, the infant had chomped and slobbered his way up to the alien-fighter's knees. Usually, Sam had his lunch break at noon, but today he was going to give Rex to his mother before the support group met at two. He planned to leave at one, allowing time to get across town, but at ten minutes til, his replacement called, and claimed a dead battery. Sam called Mr. Griner's cell phone, trying not to panic. What would happen if he was late getting Rex to Allison? She might get Joon into trouble with their therapist. No, she wouldn't do something like that, would she? She'd have to tell them about the poker game, and that wouldn't look good for her, either. \"I'm supposed to have Rex home before two, and Cathy just called and said her battery is dead, what should I do?\" he asked his boss. \"Don't worry, I'm in my car, I'll be there in a few minutes. I can handle things while you do what you have to.\" It was twenty-five minutes past one before Sam finally strapped the baby into his car seat. He took a quick inventory. Diaper bag, check, stock pot and spoon, check, enough gas to get us across town, uh-oh. Getting gas took another twelve minutes. Sam was starting to see little spots in his vison and reminded himself to breathe. When he did, he realized Rex needed a fresh diaper. He couldn't hand over the kid the way he was. Phew, Sam couldn't even stand to be in the same car with him in that condition. Cleaning and changing and dressing Rex ate up more precious time. Sam was a careful driver, which was good for getting somewhere in one piece, but not so good for getting there quickly. He missed every single traffic light and arrived at a railroad crossing just as the gate came down. It was long train--a very long train. By the time he arrived at the hospital, it was well after two o'clock, and the therapy session had already started. He waited in the reception area playing peek-a-boo with Rex, and managed a quick call to the store. Cathy had gotten a ride in to work; Sam could take the rest of the afternoon off, since his shift was over at four anyway. At ten minutes before three, the door to the therapy room opened, and the group members began emerging. Nobody seemed upset; one or two of the ladies he'd met on Tuesday greeted him and cooed over Rex--but there was still no sign of Allison, or Joon. When Sam ventured to the door of the inner sanctum, he saw Allison wiping her eyes with a piece of tissue, and a woman he guessed was their therapist was patting her shoulder. Joon was standing nearby holding the box of tissues, and she was the first one to notice him. \"There they are!\" she caroled, and Allison's head whipped around. \"Oh, thank goodness!\" She hurried over and swept Rex out of Sam's arms. \"Oh, sweetheart!\" she crooned to the baby. \"I missed you so much!\" Her voice dwindled into little murmurs, and Rex laughed and pulled her hair. She accepted the diaper bag without even looking at Sam; all her attention was on her son. \"Come on, Sam,\" said Joon. \"I promised Micki we'd give her a ride.\" \"Bye, Rex,\" Sam said over his shoulder as Joon took his hand and led him out of the room \"Joon, I think you'd better just tell him,\" Micki said a little while later as they drove her homeward. \"Tell me what?\" Sam asked uneasily. \"I want a puppy,\" said Joon. \"I think canine companionship would admirably enhance our domestic situation. Can we get one of Micki's boxer puppies? Please? I was hoping you'd bring a puppy home with you on Tuesday, but you brought Rex instead.\" \"I guess so,\" Sam answered, thinking about it. \"There's nothing against it in our lease.\" \"What are we going to call him?\" Sam asked Joon an hour later as they took the newest member of their household home. \"I thought Buster would be an appropriate name,\" she said, as the puppy licked the strap of her crash helmet. \"And see, he even looks like the dog from the Buster Brown shoe ads!\" Sam knew that wasn't the only reason Joon liked the name Buster. \"Can we have a nice, quiet evening at home tonight, and maybe watch that movie I brought home two days ago?\" he asked hopefully. \"A nice quiet evening at home with our faithful canine companion!\" Joon declared, stroking the wrinkles on the puppy's velvety forehead. \"What cinematic triumph of the silver screen are we going to be viewing?\" \"An old movie with Cary Grant,\" Sam told her. \"It's called 'Bringing Up Baby'.\" The End.

In fact, the class being an uneven number, the jocks actually fought over who would be unfortunate enough to get him. It wasn't that he couldn't do sports; it was that he just didn't care about them. He stood in the middle of the field staring at the ground or staring at his phone if the teacher wasn't looking. The thing was, he never did well in teams or group projects. He hated group projects and more importantly, he hated everyone. Maybe it was because they all made fun of him and his oversized glasses and his total lack of grace in social situations, or maybe some of it was his fault. He was too shy to speak to anyone, so they all assumed he was stuck up. He only spoke up in class and was way too curious to stop asking the teacher questions. He could do so much better on his own. He begged the teachers to work alone for projects. Most said no, but a few let him do it. Either way, he did all the work and purposely made his partner look like a complete idiot. Most of the time he warned them he'd just do everything, he was too much of a control freak to work with anyone. Bill Gates said it—it's a competitive world. If he waited around for any of these idiots to do something for him, he'd end up starving. He had to steal the bread if he wanted it. That was the truth. It was the statistics that terrified him. Just by Googling, he knew that going to college might be his best shot, but it wasn't a sure shot. What if he ended up still living in his parents' house? Goodness, he'd shoot himself if that happened. Some classes were too easy for him, though. He spent them on his phone (surprise, surprise) googling the deeper answers or playing on some stupid app on his phone. He planned the whole Google thing since High School. That's why he dreaded finding out the internship would involve him having to work in teams. At first he thought he could get away with refusing to work with anyone, and somehow hope that all these desperate sharks found a group and left him alone. Surely he could win all the challenges by himself, right? Nope. He got put with the leftovers. With the two forty-something year-old guys that had no business being here. With the weird anime girl. With the dork who got breastfed until he was seven. Great. He was doomed. He could say goodbye to the job at Google. To his future. That night he prayed to God to forgive his phone vice and to please not have him still live with his parents at forty. He would do anything. Really. Anything . The other kids were on the same page as him, though. So yeah, their team leader was too pushy and everyone possibly hated each other on the team, but that was okay, right? They wouldn't have to see anymore of each other once the internship was over. Whether they got the jobs or not. Besides, they wanted to get rid of the other two, sending them on an odyssey to find a falsely named programmer. He was astounded they didn't get the reference of a bald-headed professor in a wheelchair. And of course, the lost that challenge. Just like the Quidditch one. He had to Google half of the terminology Lyle was spitting out, causing him to get hit over the head with a ball. They pulled off seventy points in the end, but lost to freaking Graham when no one got the… That thing he didn't google. Hell, he understood the eighties references better (maybe because he was a bit of a junkie at one point or because he happened to google about those movies at some point) than he did quafflepuffing. Then came the app issue. Surely they'd lose again to Graham. God, his accent was annoying. Where the hell was he from, anyway? Cambridge University? He had, though, (no understatement, sadly) the best night of his life that day. And he wondered, after looking up three inches and being introduced to the first stripper he'd seen up close, how many things he's missed in his life. And okay, maybe, ideally, drinking and partying with strippers wasn't what he thought would be his version of fun, but it really was the best night of his life. He was quiet; he always had been quiet, despite the snarkiness. Blame it on being too absorbed in his little screen, or blame it on his lack of grace, but he never had many friends. And for the first time, he felt like he had them. Because this, this was the stupid thing his roommate was doing when he stayed in the dorm studying. He was having fun. Of course he had drinks before, but he never got to this side of himself. The type to actually get in with the strippers and dance with Neha and Yoyo, or the type to get lap dances. He never saw the crazy drunk side of himself, where he stayed away from his phone, where he punched someone in the face and got into a whole fight and was somehow incredibly pumped up about it (\"You're sure having a miserable time, kid!\"). It was such an adrenaline and he loved it. And he swore if anyone just stood in front of him, he'd kiss them or some shit he'd never, ever do, because this was the best fucking night of his life . Even getting thrown out didn't break his spirits. Goodness, he could keep going all freaking night, but then they stopped at the bridge, and it was nice, the whole view. To think he had been there thousands of times with his parents, and never had he bothered to look up. And he admitted it. Out loud. This was the best day of his life. Hell, this might have even made his year, but he wouldn't admit his life was that pathetic. And hey, the hangover was totally worth it.

He got a part-time job at Google when he was in his third year. After he graduated, it would become a full-time job. Stuart's girlfriend, Rachel Cartwright, had a part-time job as a cashier at a grocery store. They had finished their third year at Stanford. Once summer vacation ended, they would be going into their fourth and final year at Stanford. Classes were over until fall. Stuart and Rachel had a week off from work. She had decided to take him to meet her mother, Amy Cartwright, who was a single parent, and her older sister, Hannah Cartwright. Rachel and Hannah never knew their father. \"Are you excited to meet my mother and sister?\" Rachel asked Stuart as she drove her car down the road towards Quakertown, Pennsylvania. It was the heart of July, and so, the area was quite beautiful and rustic. There were valleys of green everywhere Stuart looked. He could see why Rachel liked growing up here. Rachel had fair skin, long straight blonde hair that was parted in the middle, blue eyes, and a slender figure. \"Yeah. They sound awesome,\" Stuart said. \"They are,\" Rachel said. Amy had graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and was a teacher at the local high school. Hannah didn't go to college. She had no desire to. She had a career, and it paid well. She was a professional barrel racer. Stuart climbed out of the car and onto a gravel path. Past the landscape of greenery was a two-story house with bay windows and stone-veneer siding. A middle-aged woman with fair skin, straight blonde hair that reached her shoulders and was parted in the middle, and blue eyes came out to greet Rachel and Stuart. Behind her was a young woman with fair skin, long straight blonde hair that was parted in the middle and tied up in a high ponytail, blue eyes, and a slender figure. The middle-aged woman was Rachel's mother, Amy, and the young woman was Rachel's sister, Hannah. Rachel hugged Amy and Hannah while Stuart stood by the car. \"Mom, Hannah, this is my boyfriend, Stuart Twombly. He goes to Stanford with me. He has a part-time job at Google. Stuart, this is my mother, Amy, and my older sister, Hannah.\" Rachel said. Amy smiled sweetly. \"It's nice to meet you, Stuart.\" \"It's nice to meet you too,\" Stuart said. \"Would you like a tour?\" Hannah asked Stuart. \"We can go to the barn, and I can introduce you to the horses.\" Stuart nodded. \"Sounds good.\" Rachel and Stuart followed Amy and Hannah into a red barn with a black shingled roof. \"This is my horse, Trigger. He's a little shy around new people, but maybe he'll let you pet him,\" Hannah said. Trigger was a proud and regal Standardbred gelding with a reddish-brown body and a black mane, tail, ear edges, and lower legs. He was a bit intimidating, and considering Stuart had never been this close to a horse before, venturing to touch him was admittedly pretty scary. He extended a hand to him, but he swiftly reared back and huffed indignantly, as if to say that Stuart hadn't earned the right to touch him yet. \"Sorry about that.\" Hannah apologized. \"Trigger, be nice. This is Rachel's boyfriend, Stuart, and he's going to be staying with us for the next few days, so you have to get used to him, okay?\" Trigger didn't seem interested in anything Hannah had to say and decided to chew on some oats instead. Amy's horse, Bella, seemed friendlier. She was an American Paint mare with brown and white splotches on her coat, a brown mane and tail, and a narrow white stripe running down the middle of her face. She whinnied at Stuart and allowed him to pet her forehead and mane. Amy smiled in approval and patted Bella on the neck. \"Good girl.\" Three days later Rachel and Stuart climbed up the steps of the outdoor stadium where today's barrel race was being held. \"Rachel, Stuart, over here!\" Amy called from her spot next to Hannah's boyfriend, Elliot Hadley, a clean-shaven young man with fair skin, short and straight brown hair, and green eyes. Rachel and Stuart walked over to Amy and Elliot and sat down. Rachel pulled Elliot into a hug. \"Hey Elliot. It's good to see you.\" Elliot returned the hug. \"It's good to see you too, Rachel.\" Stuart held his hand out to Elliot. \"Hi. I'm Stuart Twombly, Rachel's boyfriend.\" Elliot shook Stuart's hand. \"It's nice to meet you, Stuart. I'm Elliot Hadley, Hannah's boyfriend.\" \"Elliot and Hannah have been dating since their junior year of high school.\" Rachel informed Stuart. \"He's like the brother I never had.\" Through the loudspeaker, the rather peppy female announcer thanked everyone for coming out and gave some basic safety information about how to exit the stadium in case of an emergency, and then everyone had to stand for the American national anthem before the race finally started. Stuart had never been to a barrel race before, so he had no idea what it entailed. Apparently, it involved three barrels in a cloverleaf pattern, which horse and rider had to complete in the fastest time. \"First up is Hannah Cartwright,\" the announcer boomed. Hannah and Trigger walked through the gate. Hannah was wearing a blue and white plaid shirt with white buttons and long sleeves, a brown leather belt with a silver rectangular buckle, dark blue denim jeans, and dark brown cowboy boots. Her shirt was tucked into the waistband of her jeans. Her belt went around the waistband of her jeans. Her jeans were tucked into her boots. Her hair was gathered behind her ears in a braid. A brown cowboy hat was on her head. Trigger had on a brown Western saddle, a brown bridle with a silver bit and brown reins, and a blue saddle blanket. The buzzer sounded, and Trigger was off like a bullet, rounding the first barrel with flawless ease. Stuart couldn't help but be awed by Hannah's skill as she carefully controlled that thousand-pound animal while it was moving at tens of miles per hour. The next two barrels were rounded with the same flawlessness, without so much as a moment of stalling. As quickly as it started, it was over, as Hannah and Trigger bolted right back out of the arena. Stuart's eyes couldn't help but be glued to the dust that the feat had left in its wake. \"Time on Hannah's run: 16 seconds,\" the announcer boomed. After the other participants finished their runs, the scores were displayed on the leaderboard. Hannah had gotten first place. Outside the arena, Hannah and two other young women, who had placed second and third, dismounted their horses and grabbed hold of the reins. The three riders led their horses into the arena and came to a stop in front of the judge, who slipped gold, silver, and bronze medals around their necks. The riders left the arena and headed towards the stables. Amy, Rachel, Stuart, and Elliot walked into the stables and began to look around for Hannah. As they panned the stalls and people, they spotted her stroking Trigger's nose and feeding him a handful of oats. \"Good boy, Trigger,\" Hannah said. \"Congratulations, sweetheart,\" Amy said, pulling Hannah into a hug. Hannah smiled and returned the hug. \"Thanks.\" \"Great job,\" Rachel said, pulling Hannah into a hug. Hannah smiled and returned the hug. \"Thanks, Rachel.\" \"Nice work, Hannah,\" Stuart said. Hannah smiled. \"Thanks.\" Elliot pulled Hannah into a hug and kissed the top of her head. \"You were awesome out there!\" One day later Amy and Hannah hugged Rachel as Stuart got into the passenger's seat of Rachel's car. \"See you at Thanksgiving, sweetheart,\" Amy said. Rachel pulled away from the hug, got into the driver's seat of her car, and backed out of the driveway.

They were barely even friends. Nick and Billy had brought the team together, but that didn't make them friends. Stuart could smell every scent coming off her as they worked. It didn't help that they worked incredibly close and was always within sniffing distance of her long dark hair. She smelled like curry and Tresemme Naturals. He might have bought a couple bottles of her shampoo which he opens sometimes at night to sniff. He might have stood in the shampoo aisle of the market for an hour a week ago trying to match her scent. He mentally kicked himself for it. She was the only thing that got his attention away from his phone screen. He would often catch himself staring at her in long intervals. Sometimes he would stare at her instead of doing the work for the team, and when Lyle or Nick would look his way he'd go back to work immediately. He had gotten so used to her presence that it was noticeable when she wasn't around and felt like a huge let down. He saved her a seat at lunch, but she didn't show up. He knew they would have to squeeze in and she'd practically be on his lap because Billy was basically a tree and occupied a lot of space, not that he complained about the lap situation. \"Anyone seen Neha?\" Nick asked and he looked directly at Stuart, who tried not blush as he hid behind his smart phone. \"I heard her talking to Graham earlier,\" said Yo-Yo. \"He told her he would have picked her for his team but she's too pretty and he'd get distracted.\" Stuart hated Graham, but the douche bag had a point. It was the exact problem that Stuart faced. Still that was no reason to ditch them? \"Oh, so he pays her a compliment and she stays behind to flirt with him?\" Stuart asked. \"You don't know that.\" \"Well she's obviously not here and we were waiting for her,\" Stuart said, not sure how to stop himself from sounding upset. Shut up, Stuart, before they figure it out. \"She might be having woman problems,\" said Billy. \"Oh,\" said Stuart, \"She should let us know, so we don't worry.\" \"I'm not worried,\" said Lyle. Don't you open your mouth. Quit while you're ahead. Just text her. \"How could you say that?\" Stuart asked. Stop talking. Stop talking now. \"She's a big girl. She can take care of herself. Besides she's right there,\" Lyle said pointing over Stuart's shoulder. There she was indeed. Neha was talking to Graham. Stuart stood up. What am I doing? Sit down. She was walking toward them. Stuart put his butt back on the bench and buried his face behind his smart phone. He casually peeked over to see what she was doing. Stop being obvious. \"She's talking to that asshole,\" Nick said surprised. \"She could do better, she's a bright girl,\" said Billy. For the love of God, don't comment. Stuart bit his bottom lip and occupied himself with her Facebook page. \"Hey, guys,\" said Neha, sliding onto the bench and practically on his lap. Stuart caught a whiff of her curry/Tresemme scent and felt a heavy flutter in his chest. \"Why were you talking to Graham?\" Yo-Yo asked. \"I was flirting with him to try to throw him off so maybe we'd have an advantage on the next challenge. He figured out what I doing though, because as it turns out he was doing the exact same thing to me.\" \"So you don't like him?\" Stuart asked. \"Gross, no,\" Neha said. Stuart felt a mix of hope and something else that he couldn't put his finger on. Neha wiggle a little against his knee and he felt something else then too. His breath was caught in his throat and he tried not to move too much. He hoped none of the others could see his plight, especially Neha. \"Some of us were worried about you,\" Nick said. \"Only some of you,\" Neha said. \"Some more than others, apparently,\" said Lyle. \"That's so sweet. You guys care. You act like you don't, but you do.\" She pinched Lyle's cheek. He got the smile from Neha Stuart felt he deserved. He rolled his eyes and pushed her away from him. He climbed off the bench. It was too much to be that close to her. \"Where're you going?\" Neha asked. \"I have shit to do,\" Stuart said, and he walked away from her and the rest of Team Lyle as fast as he could. Back in their designated work zone he sat down, put his hand over his fluttering chest and tried to catch his breath. I'm pathetic as shit. \"What the fuck was that?\" Nick asked. \"I have work to do,\" Stuart said. He pretended to get busy on something, he knew Nick wasn't buying it and he should come clean. But a part of him suspected that Nick already knew everything. \"Just ask her out,\" Nick said. \"I can't.\" \"Why?\" \"We're not allowed to date fellow interns.\" \"Oh, yeah, that,\" Nick said. \"So you're going to pine for her instead?\" \"I'm not pining,\" Stuart lied. Yes, I am. \"Stewie,\" said Nick. \"It's a crush, it'll pass.\" \"Do you really want it to?\" \"Yes,\" said Stuart. He had not even convinced himself that's true. He wanted her. He wanted to go home and talk to his mother about Neha. He wanted to turn down the internship. He wanted to hide behind his smart phone. He wanted to never have met Neha. It wasn't that easy. Over the next couple of challenges it got worse. His chest ached and he couldn't stop staring at her. Stuart made excuses to himself about why he was always sitting next to her, why he let her sit on his lap when there were no chairs available. A problem started to arise so he made her get off. \"I can't believe the summer is almost over,\" said Neha with her head lying on his knee during downtime. Stuart met Nick's eye and he winked at him. Stuart didn't know what to do with his hands so he put one in her hair and the other on the desk and tried to think about anything but the beautiful woman lying on his knee. \"Yeah,\" said Yo-Yo. \"We should go to the movies,\" said Neha. Stuart breathed deeply. Neha wanted to be alone with him in a dark room. His heart and brain were panicking. Stuart tapped on her to get her to sit up. He had to get out of there. The air was too tight and it was difficult to breathe. ","Summary":" Stuart's Dilemma Neha was not his girlfriend. They were barely even friends.

But to be seen at Harvard? That's when heads turned as she walked through those historic hallways in her Louboutins and a Gucci bag on her arm. Truth be told, she was born rich. She had insisted on working hard to get into Harvard, she didn't want her father paying for a way in. She wasn't a spoiled little brat. She was a good person. Even though she was destined to be a high class doctor, she saw the ad for an internship at Google. She had always loved technical stuff, even though she mostly excelled at Biology and Chemistry. She had instantly applied for the internship and within only two weeks, she was screened through and ready for a Skype interview. Two workers popped up on the camera. There was a dark-skinned woman and a light-skinned man, both looked very professional. \"Good morning, Miss Jones.\" The woman greeted. \"Morning.\" Caprice grinned, obviously a morning person. \"I'm Benjamin.\" The male introducted. \"And I'm Allison.\" The female introducted. \"Of course you know who I am.\" Caprice chuckled. \"Caprice Jones.\" \"Yes.\" Allison smiled. \"So Caprice, where do you see yourself in five years?\" Benjamin questioned. \"Well, I would like to have a well-paying job.\" Caprice folded her hands, placing her elbows on the table and resting her chin on her linked fingers. \"Maybe a manager at Google, or as a surgeon.\" \"Ah yes, we see from your test results, that you maintained a 5.0 GPA in your senior year.\" Allison's smile widened as she looked down at a piece of paper. \"Yeah, and it's what got me into Harvard.\" Caprice blushed. \"I mean, I don't want to sound conceited, but I'm kinda smart.\" \"Not conceited at all.\" Benjamin laughed. \"You are very smart.\" \"Thank you.\" Caprice's blush darkened, her neck burning hotly. \"So, why do you want to work at Google?\" Allison asked. \"I think it would just be a great learning opportunity for me and I think I could make some great changes to the website.\" Caprice shrugged. \"Very nice answer.\" Benjamin nodded. \"You'll hear from us soon, Caprice.\" \"Thank you.\" Caprice repeated, her hands running through her strawberry blonde locks. \"No, thank you.\" Allison pointed a pen at the screen before the call cut off. Caprice let out a nervous breath, her manicured nails drumming against her work desk that was placed in her Harvard dorm room. \"I hope I get this.\" Caprice sighed, pushing herself away from her desk and throwing herself onto her luxurious bed. I've been waiting for some opening sentence to pop up in my head so I could create this story because I just love The Internship, and then a lightbulb flashed above my head and I just had to write the whole first chapter. It's more of a prologue to the whole story as it's so short and it's before the actual internship starts. So, Caprice's face is Holland Roden and she will be paired with Stuart. As you can tell, I'm a huge Stydia fan so that's part of the reason why I casted her, and because she's going to be slightly similar to Lydia. Like, you don't expect the extremely beautiful rich girl to be so academic and prestigious but she really is. Stuart will probably taunt her about her father and she may hit him because he's such a jackass at the start. Okay, thank you for reading this prologue!

She was excited to share the outline of her summer and even more to know Neha's side of the story. During the first few hours of her arrival, Corgi heard her friend blabber about how exciting yet fun her summer was. She saw her beaming with victory and triumph. And although Corgi was not accustomed to imagining things, did she see an extra flush of red in her best friend's cheeks or the excited yet nervous glint in her eyes? Corgi had known Neha for a long time now and she knew that Neha might not look too splendid but guys generally fell for her due to her vivaciousness. Over the years she had seen men reject pretty girls to be with Neha- she was smart and sassy, enriched with a sunny disposition. But wasn't Neha immune to their charms? And as Corgi so often liked to tease, \"You're looking for a magical and dramatic love story, aren't you Neha?\" So, undoubtedly, it was rather alarming for Corgi to see Neha talk about a certain boy called Stuart in a way she'd never talked about a boy before. She was completely baffled to find her lost in thoughts during lectures or remain quiet during spicy girl talks. Was this love, Corgi pondered. 'Cause if this was the case, she knew Neha well enough to know that she won't be able to find the courage to confront Stuart about her feelings. Although Neha was an extrovert, say-it-all kind of person, when it came to relationships, she actually managed to conceal her feelings. Would Corgi play the matchmaker? No, she'd rather like it if Neha handled things on her own. \"This is going to be even more challenging and fun, Neha,\" she proclaimed quietly. Time is fleeting. Corgi and Neha didn't realize that in two month's time, they'd have their final exams and would go separate ways. It was the next summer and Corgi was tanning her body in the sun, playing soccer in a camp in Mexico. And when she headed back to the changing room after three consecutive hours of practice, she saw her phone whine about '7 missed calls' of Neha. So Neha was tensed up about an upcoming party at the Google Headquarters. \"You've no reason to be apprehensive about that,\" Corgi was about to say just as the words sank in. And she realized, saying softly, \"Stuart.\" She felt Neha nod reluctantly. \"Is it a casual or formal event?\" Corgi asked. \"Formal. It's an award ceremony,\" Neha answered, \"Oh and it is actually tonight…\"she trailed off. Corgi could never trust Neha enough to let her dress herself for a party, especially for a formal one. The last thing she wanted to hear was that Neha went to the event wearing a bright, flashy dress backed up with some funky accessories. Almost driven by a motive, Corgi mumbled \"Call you back in a few minutes,\" into the phone. It would take her approximately three and a half hour to reach San Jose. She Google searched to find that the next flight was leaving the next hour. 0000000000000000000000 Corgi chose a beige-coloured tiered dress for Neha which complimented that brownness of her skin. The dress offered embellishment without adding glitter or sparkle. Tiers are a bold fashion statement and need almost no jewellery. However, to bring attention to details on the top of the dress or to the face and hairstyle, Corgi selected a pair of large hoop earrings. Her hair and make-up was explicitly done and Corgi knew that there was no way Stuart could divert his attention from Neha even for a split second. Neha blinked at the stranger in the mirror. The stranger blinked at her with her mascara-fed eyes. The make-up and hair was impeccable. The lipstick was not too glossy; it picked out the boldness and softness of her scarlet lips. Her skin was wrapped in a layer of Bobbi Brown foundation cream, making her look paler. The mascara over her eyes was dark and defined and the large loops dangling from her ears accentuated the black of her eyes. Her posh dress was yet another story. The neckline showed off a little extra cleavage than Neha intended. Her curves looked more defined and she definitely looked less fat. But something was not right with her attire. Neha was confused and felt uneasy. After all, she failed to recognize the person staring back at her. She tittered and then looked too serious. \"I can't do this.\" She backtracked. \" I can't believe my hands could work such a magic, \" her friend laughed, \"Girl, just take some fashion advice from me and you'll be the star of the evening every time.\" Corgi said with a flourish, sipping her sixth cup of coffee. \"I can't do this.\" Neha repeated. \"Nervous, yeah? When I dressed up for the sophomore prom, I was so nervous. I didn't think I could handle all the atten-\" \"Corgi,\" Neha cut her off, \"I can't do this,\" she pressed. \"What do you mean by you can't do it?\" Corgi asked. \"Corgi, this is not me,\" she sighed, \"I appreciate you and thank you for transforming me into a Hollywood diva. But originally I don't look like this. This is a result of layers of make-up and an expensive dress.\" Corgi remained silent, puzzled, which encouraged Neha to continue, \"I do want Stuart to like me. But if he's attracted to me tonight, I know it's not me but the make-up.\" She took a pause. \"OK, let's say he will like me tonight. Let's say we'll get together. But, shall I wear all this make-up everyday to make him continue to like me?\" \"So you want to remove it all?\" Corgi said. She strongly needed a negative response. \"Look, I'm sorry,\" Neha ventured, \"But-\" \"What do you mean by you're sorry? Do you even realize what you're saying? Neha, I had work to do. I flew down all the way here to help you out. And now you say you want to erase my efforts?\" Corgi bellowed. \"And also you look great. You look…\" she groped for the right word. \"Bootylicious!\" \"I want to look natural, not artificial.\" \"You could have said that on the phone and saved me the trip.\" \"Will remember that the next time.\" Neha muttered and left for the bathroom. 000000000000000000 Corgi had her handbag packed but the next flight wasn't until the morning. She glanced at her wrist watch, it was ten past nine. Despite herself, Corgi decided to go to the ceremony. She kicked off her jeans and her Calvin Klein blouse to put on the least flashy/fancy dress Neha had in her wardrobe. Before leaving, she fetched the coupon Neha had offered before to her into the party. By the time Corgi reached the venue, the venue was over. Light music filled the hall. People were dancing and drinking alcohol. She spotted Neha standing with a few co-workers of hers. She was wearing the same dress which Corgi had picked but there was no trace of make-up on her face. Her hair was done in a neat pony tail. She didn't look as appealing as before but she looked very pretty. She had a natural and beholding charisma. Corgi met Neha's friends- the big, funny and friendly Billy. Equally funny and charming Nick and his girlfriend Dana. She was very beautiful and very, very sophisticated. Lyle was too cocky while Yo-Yo was quiet and very reluctant to drink champagne. Corgi wanted to know what Stuart looked like. She had indeed seen a group photo of the friends but it was too small to judge. The way Neha had described him, it was handy to have Stuart built up so much. When she'd see him he would certainly be disappointing. Since he was not standing with the group, she looked elsewhere, trying to spot the boy with glasses and a beanie. She followed Neha's eyes. So Stuart wasn't disappointing. He wore a simple tux and looked sober. But disappointing was the pretty blonde pressed against him. Such an artificial beauty, Corgi thought. She suddenly smiled to herself, realizing that her friend had actually been correct. Make-up is indeed magic. It can transform you within seconds. But it can never compete with the natural glow of your skin. Neha was so young. Desires of youth were burning inside her body. And her beauty, which was neither splendid nor plain, was blossoming to its zenith. That ecstatic energy which flowed through her nerves flushed her cheeks red. She looked refreshing. So, it was naturally disappointing to see Stuart all over some girl he'd just met. But even more disappointing was the hurt feeling in Neha's eyes. The evening continued. They had such a great time, laughing and sharing embarrassing stories about one another. And, blushingly, Corgi admitted to herself that she came to adore Yo-Yo's quietness. She'd laughed so hard when Billy told her about how Yo-Yo had plucked his eyebrow. And she promised to show him a salon where he could get it all right. It was ten past twelve and in spite of the wonderful time she was having, Corgi asked Neha if they could leave. She had a flight to catch the next morning. Corgi saw Neha see Stuart leave with the blonde chic he was with. Neha looked utterly upset. For the first time in her life, Neha doubted her actions, her ideologies. And for Corgi, it was the most disappointing. 0000000000000000 Four miles away, Stuart was lying on his bed, lost in thoughts. He didn't notice the little strip-tease act the blonde girl was performing. His heart and mind was fixed on a certain raven-haired beauty. And when the girl fell with a bang next to him, he couldn't help but wish it were Neha. 2) An year after his employment, Stuart goes to visit his parents in England. It is September and summer is in the air. Leaves are spiralling around empty branches and flowers are wearing an invigorating fragrance. The country is hot and humid, sheltered by a copper sky. Stuart makes a stop in London, before heading for his hometown Elway, embedded in the valley of Corin. Unlike the rest of the country, Elway never has summers; its coolness is supported by an array of lakes and a dense forest. It is a really small town, but it does not miss any institution of necessity. When Stuart steps out of the train, he's met by the chilly air of Corin and the embracing arms of his mother. During the first few days of his arrival, he's treated like a guest. Although later he has to receive an hour of lecture from his mother at not waking up early or walking on the carpet with muddy shoes and endure the stern gaze of his father when he mockingly asks about the sexy daughter of his parents' friends. His mother prepares his favourite meals: lemon roast chicken and treacle tart. It's almost a ritual for his father and him to go hunting in the mornings and fishing in the evenings. It is the lake Corin, after which the valley itself is named, where they like to go fishing. Sometimes his mother comes along, carrying a basket of Stuart's least favourite fruits, stuffing them into his mouth as he scorns, insisting that they're good for health. About two days before Stuart's parents leave for the much awaited trip to Salaria, an island in Pacific Ocean, which contains the best beaches of the world and is the Twomblys' favourite travel destination, Stuart received a mail from Neha. Though Stuart is the kind of person who is always neck deep inside his phone's screen, he admits to prefer the peace and calm of Elway over technology. Or that's what he told his parents, who secretly seem to know that the real reason is that they live in a low internet connectivity region. His days are remarked with indolence and nothingness. And although there's a lot to discover in the depth of lakes and density of the forest, Stuart finds his activities limited. So, out of random, he picks a day to visit the cyber café. He sardonically smiles at the keeper who tells him proudly that the speed of internet is high that day, referring to mere 5.7Mbit/s. Stuart's inbox is accosted with a hundred mails. ' I'm in London.' – The mail from Neha states. She mentions some unfinished business and he can immediately guess that she wants him to read between the lines. An even more immediate reaction of his is to invite her over his parents' place. Now that she's made the trip to London, it wouldn't take too much to visit his hometown, where all his childhood memories live. He stared back at the screen for tow full minutes, which reads: Your message has been successfully sent. He wishes that she's decline his request; he does not want to cancel he trip with his parents that he's supposed to join. Yet, somewhere in his heart, he thinks it was nit such a bad idea after all. He would have asked her to come to Salaria, but it needed a pre-booking. And he doubts that she's willing to make such a long trip with him. She accepts the proposal. He cannot go to Salaria now. Stuart makes that dreadful trip to home and he feels like a teenage boy, returning home late at night, ready to be questioned. His parents are clearly disappointed. ' A trip to Salaria is not so easy and inexpensive to make.' His mother says. But they are more disappointed by the fact that it is a girl (they've never heard of) who poses as an obstacle. Stuart thinks that maybe they'd always pictured him with the aforementioned daughter of their friends. He gives them a wave as they climb the bus to Port of England. He has finally persuaded them to go without him. It is six in the evening when Neha's train arrives in the railway station. Stuart is waiting impatiently, a half-filled can of Diet Coke and a neatly folded shawl in his arms. When she steps out of the train, she's immediately struck with Corin's air, which is even colder now. The wind sways her hair harshly and she has to fetch a band from her purse to tie it up in a pony tail. \"I thought it would be hot,\" She says, indicating the sundress she is wearing. He quietly offers the shawl in his arms and she smiles adorably, \"You knew.\" They enter the silence of the empty house in uneasiness. 'Cause although they're always at each other's apartments, it is very new for them to have such a big house to themselves. That night when Neha comes out of the bathroom, she is shivering. She accuses him for not demonstrating the tap controls. They argue and laugh it off; it is a light-hearted moment. But the next morning, Neha is about to step into the bathtub when she realizes she has yet to learn the tap controls from Stuart. She calls him and after five minutes she can hear him making his way down the stairs. She is half-naked and does not want to look lewd in front of him. She searches for a bathrobe and manages to find nothing but a towel- she wraps it over her Victoria's Secret black bra and panty. He tries to appear as unnerved as possible and silently curses the genes which make men so naturally attracted to nudity. And suddenly a thought strikes him, almost a rehabilitating thought. He has decided that no matter how aroused he feels, he would want to have her in all places but the bathroom of his parents' house. She deserves better. He doesn't want her to think that he's attracted to her naked state. There's a knocking at the door. Stuart watches Neha make her way to the heart of the room. She perches lightly on the bed. She's wearing no make-up, as usual, and has put on a baggy morning gown. But for Stuart, she is the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. \"I want to tell you something.\" He notes that she's nervous. Neha takes a deep breath before she starts again. \"I didn't have any business in London. I lied. I wanted to…I just wanted to be with you for the summer too.\" Stuart is flattered; he knows that the trip to London must have cost her a lot. And even though it is not, it seems like a confession to both Neha and Stuart. He knows it's his chance now, he can't delay anymore. He looks into her eyes and begins, \"Salaria is a very beautiful island in the middle of the Pacific ocean...\" He tells her about the island, about its lush, green shrubs and tall coconut trees, the white sands and clear blue waters. He tells her about the amber-pink glow of sun in dawn and the countless stars dancing in the night sky. His description is solely based on the stories his mother used to tell him as a boy. He tells her about how his parents saved to make the trip of their lives; their plans included him. \"They left four days ago. I was supposed to go with them.\" \"But you didn't go.\" Stuart wants to use a good pick-up line. He wants to say something which will make him look neither desperate nor indifferent. But it is of no use, she is waiting and he can't think of anything good. He decides to go for honesty and says: \"I couldn't leave an opportunity to be with you.\" They are silent now, wondering what to say or do next. Silence is peaceful and comfortable now. Neha glances at him, amazed by his good looks. He wears a boyish charm with the sensibility of a grown-up man. She is appalled by the tickling sensation running down her body in his company. Although their friends say it was inevitable, it is hard to believe they've come so close. Suddenly, she wants to touch him and be touched. Suddenly, she asks him: \"Would you mind if I…\" she doesn't complete her sentence as she removes his beanie and run a hand over his hair. It is matted, but she likes the feel of it. This is something that she'd wanted to do since the day they'd met. \"I always wanted to know how this feels like…\" she explains. They are just a few inches apart now. If Neha thinks that his gaze can melt ice, she is instantly water as he slides his arm around her waist and leans forward to kiss her, after saying: \"And I always wanted to know how this feels like.\" 3) It was the summer Corgi turned 29. She was tanning her body in the sun, in a camp in Mexico. She's a coach now. \"Four rounds of the track,\" she yelled and the young players started to run fervently. When she pulled out the phone from her bag as she sat on the grass, she saw her phone whine about ' 7 missed calls ' from Neha. Corgi's surprised and excited to hear from her friend. Neha blushed when she said, \"I'm getting married.\" \"Wait-WHAT?\" Corgi shouted on the phone. \"Do you want to be the maid of honour or shall I ask someone else?\" -Finish- Reviews are welcome.

It breaks the ice—the ice of his ever-present glare, the ice of lingering disappointment and frustration. A rush of pheromones (and alcohol) burns through them, reminding them that they're not just brains, but bodies as well (and, somewhere deep down, perhaps hearts.) They are suddenly more aware of the space between their bodies; they cling to this distance desperately, even as another shot makes it even harder, as if there were magnets sewn just under their skin. Then another shot, and they're all crowding together for a picture, but they don't separate now. Her hipbone presses against his as the bare skin on their upper arms rubs together. His hand rests absently on her thigh, but before they have a change to process this, the team is on the move. Everything is loud music, sweat, and laughter. There are beautiful ( beautiful ) women and sexual awakenings to deal with and enjoy, but they are silently nagging at each other's minds.

Anyway, this is probably set about 8 months after the movie, and a couple of months after our favourite characters started their job at Google. Title is from 'Neopolitan Dreams' by Lisa Mitchell. Neha's first half-formed thought when she wakes up is that it's freezing. She sluggishly reaches down and pulls her sheets up to her neck, her fingers tugging until she's covered. Her head is pounding - what the hell did she do last night? This is when she realises that she's cold because she's naked. She's finding it hard to concentrate because of the intense pain in her head, but even in her semi-conscious state she can realise that this is odd. Neha may be a starving tech worker but she does own pyjamas. She opens her eyes and tries to focus on her clock. She can't remember if she turned her alarm off last night. Except it's not her clock. It's not her room, either. Neha is waking up naked is someone else's room. And what's worse, she knows who's room she's in. She's been in here enough times, writing out coding or just listening to some stupid music and getting drunk off her ass. Stuart's clock blinks at her and Neha wonders if this is some bizarre dream. She's a virgin. The most sex Neha's ever had is a guy dressed as the Green Lantern palmed her chest as Comic-Con last year, so the fact that she's naked and hungover in Stuart's room is really fucking weird. And she can't remember anything after meeting up with Yo-Yo and Stuart at the dance club- an actual dance club, not the stripper kind- but if she's gone and lost her virginity and she can't even remember it then she's going to be pissed. Her head is throbbing and Neha knows Stuart's apartment well enough to know that the half-opened door she's got her eyes on leads to a bathroom. She reluctantly shrugs off the sheet and is met with icy cold air as she sits up. Her head swings as she rises but not as much as her stomach does when she turns around and finds out she's right. Stuart is asleep and more naked than Neha is comfortable with, a sheet covering choice body parts. He's sprawled all over one half of his tiny bed. She shivers, probably from the cold, and drags herself into the bathroom. Closing the door, she catches a glance of herself in the mirror and really wishes she hadn't. Her hair looks like it's matting and her make-up is smeared all over her face. To make a general statement, she looks like shit. She steps into the shower and it provides a warm comfort to a situation that's a mix between a movie and Supernatural fanfiction. And Neha's had boyfriends who she's dated for ages with no talk of bedroom activities, and she's known Stuart for what, eight months? And she's suddenly having a shower after having sex she can't remember. It's not that she doesn't like Stuart. She really likes Stuart. She would totally be down with having sex with Stuart. Except she would have preferred to lose her virginity in a romantic, world-stopping, life-changing way. Or involving chains and collars, Neha's fine with either. If she's counting the few advantages, she can't remember the pain of having her hymen stretched. Her thighs are sort of sore, but it's drowned out by the throbbing in her head. Also in advantages: she's had sex with Stuart. Neha smiles to herself. She bets it was great sex. Really fun, casual, sex. Which she can't remember. Neha's seen movies so she knows how this is going to go. A bit of awkwardness, probably followed by a couple of weeks of avoiding each other and thick sexual tension until finally they make out in front of a sunset. She turns off the stream of water and steps out of the shower. She's only realising now that she doesn't have her own towel and she has no idea where her clothes are. Hopefully somewhere in the house or that's just going to get embarrassing. She towels her hair down and then dries the rest of her body. Her head still feels fragile but she's awake now, and she can deal with whatever mess she's created. She wraps the towel around herself and opens the door again. Despite the sunlight flooding the room from the flimsy curtains, Stuart is still sound asleep. Neha spots her bra in the corner of the room and she picks it up, not really wanting to put it back on until she's got the rest of her outfit. She goes out into the hallway and finds her underwear right outside the door. It feels like a weird game of Hide and Seek, not helped when Neha finds her dress on the kitchen bench. Whoah, her drunk self is one adventurous bastard. She puts her clothes back on, and they feel crumpled and backwards, but she drapes the towel over one of the chairs and pours herself a glass of water. She's on her third glass and her hangover is lessening when she thinks she should probably do something about the one-night stand situation. Leaving without saying anything would be immature, and waking him up would be rude, so Neha makes herself coffee and is just stirring it when Stuart walks out scratching his head. He's wearing boxers, thank god, because honestly if Stuart walked out naked then Neha really doubts this conversation would go in the dignified way she wants it to. As it is, she can't stop her eyes from raking his body. He freezes when he sees her, then looks down at himself, as if wishing he'd taken more time to dress. \"Neha,\" he chokes out, \"so we really-\" \"Yeah,\" Neha finishes, saving him the trouble of saying 'had drunken sex'. \"Yeah,\" Stuart agrees, then looks at the cup of coffee she's holding. \"Oh, do you want one?\" Neha asks and Stuart nods. \"I'll just… get dressed,\" he says and disappears back into his bedroom. Neha makes another cup and by the time it's ready, Stuart is fully clothed and wincing at light. Neha passes him the coffee and he thanks her. \"So is this it?\" Neha can't help but ask. \"Um,\" Stuart says, ducking his head. He's not wearing a beanie for once, which means at the back of her mind she's thinking about running her hand through his hair. \"I don't know. Is it? I mean-\" \"Hey, no obligation here. I'm cool. I'm totally cool.\" And she is. Neha is a 21st century woman who can have casual sex with one of her closest friends. Stuart considers her for a second before saying \"Okay.\" They drink their coffee in silence for a while until Neha says \"You haven't got work today have you?\" \"It's Saturday,\" Stuart says, the cool dude façade so painful Neha considers stabbing herself with the nearest butter knife. \"Last time I checked the internet still worked on Saturday.\" Stuart rolls his eyes and it's all so familiar, except something's a little offbeat. \"Last time I checked I don't get paid barely enough for them to make me work Saturdays.\" \"There's such a thing as overtime, you know that right?\" \"Yeah, because they really want someone who's been working for a grand total of two months to be manning the desks on a weekend.\" \"Do you really think one of the largest companies in the world would give a shit who works a couple of extra hours?\" Neha asks, and Stuart groans. \"I'm too hungover to argue about our jobs.\" Neha looks at him and then says \"That's two of us.\" Stuart looks at her through his glasses and says \"Sorry, I didn't mean-\" \"Why don't I go?\" Neha bursts out and then stumbles on with \"we're both tired and probably don't want to talk right now. I should just go.\" \"Yeah,\" Stuart says, and then repeats it like it makes sense. \"Yeah, maybe that would be good.\" Neha picks up her purse (recovered from behind the toaster, what the hell is she like drunk?) and heads towards the door. As she steps into the hallway she says \"We're not going to change, right?\" Stuart shakes his head, and it's the last glimpse Neha gets of him before she closes the door. She spends the rest of the day emailing her parents and programming apps and other stupid, mindless, activities that she doesn't pay attention to. She loves not working weekends because it's so conventional, so average. She texts Lyle, talks about his latest project. It's a new app that he's been commissioned for and Neha's impressed; it's a big deal for him. She doesn't feel changed, like's she's been touched by some magical virginity fairy, but she doesn't feel let down either. She's lost her virginity. Awesome. She's not going through some external crisis because of some guy's penis. Except it's Stuart? Which is weird. Like in some ways she's glad because she likes Stuart, and she trusts him which is better than some guy off the street. But this logic falls apart when she realises she has to spend every day with someone who she's seen naked. Even if she can't remember it. He doesn't text her all weekend. So much for them not changing because if they hadn't had sex then her phone would be buzzing every few minutes with some irrelevant comment from him. They both turn up at work on Monday and make a show of being as friendly as usual. He holds open the door for her and it's so ridiculous that he must realise it and keeps a solid two feet of distance for the rest of the walk to Lyle's office. \"So guys,\" Lyle says when they're both standing in front of him, \"you know I've been working on a project.\" \"Yeah,\" Neha nods, \"the app.\" \"Which is great and all,\" Stuart says, not insincerely, \"but what does that have to do with us?\" \"Well,\" Lyle beamed, \"Andrew's given me a lot of leeway and I guess I'd like to extent it.\" Neha and Stuart glance at each other and he says \"You're asking us for help?\" Lyle is practically buzzing when he says \"No, I'm offering you an opportunity. You'll get to help me present this in front of the board when it's done and credited when it's out on the web.\" They're both hesitant. It's a big ask with a lot of pressure and Lyle knows it, which is probably why he adds \"You'll both get paid extra, of course.\" \"Okay,\" Neha agrees, just as Stuart says \"Yeah, I'll do it.\" Lyle looks like he could burst. \"I've got some plans laid out. Okay, more like a blueprint than plans, I mean, I don't have a schedule or anything yet. I was hoping that you guys would help me out without the finer details, like the marketing plan won't be us, obviously, but we're expected to make some contribution.\" Neha and Stuart both nod slowly. It seems safest. \"So,\" Neha says brightly, \"where do we start?\" It starts with coding, obviously. They throw ideas to each other and when something doesn't sound overly ridiculous they write it down, line after line worth of ideas until Lyle finally decides says enough and they try and pull it together into some sort of manageable work. It's going well, really well, and Neha's enjoying it. What's better than a genuinely motivating job with two of your closest friends? Actually, now that she thinks about it some tequila would be nice. But you can't have everything. \"I think this would be a good time to break for lunch,\" Lyle says, his eyes not leaving the screen. Stuart groans. \"We're just getting started,\" he protests. \"We can't break flow now,\" Neha agrees. \"If we don't break now we'll be here all night,\" Lyle says, still not turning to look at them. The other two know that Lyle's going to be here all night and most of the morning no matter what protests are made, so they wordlessly get up and make their way to the café. Free food is literally Neha's lifeblood, so the fact that she gets it every day she works is a major plus. She sips coffee as she takes her seat, a bagel in her other hand. Stuart hesitates for a second before he sits next to her. He takes a bite out of whatever pastry looked particularly appetising today. Neha makes an effort not to watch. \"Do you ever think about how insanely lucky we are?\" Neha finds herself asking as she chews. \"What are you talking about?\" \"You know,\" Neha says with her mouth full, \"the job. Firstly, it's awesome. Like, I don't think you get how awesome the job we work at is.\" \"That sentence is a grammatical mess,\" Stuart says, \"and I know we've got an awesome job.\" \"But it's like, even if it wasn't freaking amazing we'd still have a job. I mean I have friends who did the same degree as me and they're still living with their parents. Which isn't bad, but compared to here…\" \"Dude,\" Stuart says, and he says it in such a way that it's enough to make Neha look at him, actually look. He says \"you think we're lucky?\" \"You don't?\" Neha questions. \"We got the interview. We got through the internship with as much dignity as possible in those stupid hats, and we're the ones who landed the job. Everyone in this building is here because they're the best.\" \"Because we're some of the best,\" Neha corrects. \"What makes us better than the rest of the best?\" Stuart pauses for a moment before he says \"Charisma.\" When they go back up to where Lyle's working only to be waved off. \"Take the day,\" he says, his eyes not moving from the screen. \"Nothing personal, I just need to do this alone for a bit.\" \"Is that the best idea?\" Neha asks. \"Yeah, man. We can help you out,\" Stuart says. \"I know,\" Lyle replies, \"but right now I'll work best without distractions.\" Neha's beginning to feel like she's spending her life being told to relax by the most uptight guy she's ever met. \"C'mon,\" she says to Stuart and she shoves some notes into her bag. He follows her in a weird puppy-like way until they get to the front steps and Neha says \"Are you taking the bus?\" Stuart looks at her through those stupid glasses and Neha is suddenly overwhelmed with the urge to tear off his jacket and kiss him so hard she leaves bruises but she constricts herself with biting her bottom lip. He must notice because he looks away and grunts \"No.\" \"Okay then,\" Neha says, heat rising to her cheeks, \"I guess I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Yeah,\" Stuart says, \"see you then.\" Neha waits for her bus for a good fifteen minutes, and she spends most of that time fuming. She's mainly angry at herself- having sex with Stuart what the hell was she thinking- but at the same time it's not like it was solely her decision (at least, she's pretty sure she didn't). It was a mutual agreement between two consenting adults so why the hell should one night ruin one of the best relationships in her life? She knows that if they got half the day off before last weekend they'd go out, get food, get drunk. Now Neha's waiting alone without so much as a text. Fuck Stuart. Neha doesn't need some stupid hipster beanie wearing tech genius to re-affirm her sex appeal. If that asshole doesn't want anything to do with her, fine. Except Neha likes him. Stuart's funny and smart and understands Neha, and isn't that what matters? Of course, that doesn't really matter if they never talk again. Neha watches four episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist when she gets home. There are bills she has to pay and she hasn't called her mum in weeks but right now she really just needs to watch Ed's struggle with the seven deadly sins. Neha's done with anything that involves thinking. She'll quite her job, her job where she gets free food and there are slides in the foyer and- Okay, Neha loves her job. But she is up for something mindless. Neha just wants to relax without having to stress and worry through every second. For example- And completely without meaning to, Neha is already typing out ' Are you home right now?' And sending it to Stuart without really realising what she's done. She gets a text back in a matter of seconds reading ' Yeah, y?' The reasonable thing to do right now is to make up an excuse and browse Archive Of Our Own for the rest of the night. If Neha was a reasonable person she wouldn't have got her job. It's like a ten minute taxi ride to Stuart's house and when she gets out she's suddenly hit by nerves. She's had sex a grand total of once, a time that she can't remember. She has no idea if Stuart wants to get it on with her, or if she's even good at sex. But she rings his apartment buzzer because she really doesn't think she should over-analysis this situation. She buzzes and a moment later the door clicks open, and Neha takes a breath and then tackles the flight of steps to Stuart's apartment (the elevator broke ages ago). She knocks on the door and Stuart opens it, his jaw hanging slightly. \"Neha,\" he states. \"Can I come in?\" she asks, trying to keep her tone neutral. \"I-yeah\" Stuart stutters and swings the door open. Neha shuts it behind her and they stand in his kitchen for a second, just staring at each other. \"I think we should have sex,\" Neha blurts out, \"I mean, again. You know.\" Stuart looks like he's been hit over the head. He's trying to get words out but can't quite manage it. \"Okay,\" Neha breathes and takes off her shirt. Stuart makes a strangled noise from the back of his throat that Neha takes as a go ahead, but just in case she asks \"So do you want-\" And then he's kissing her, his lips are crashing into hers and she presses herself into him, her hands travelling over his stomach, pulling off his jacket and beanie, running her fingers through his hair. \"I'll take that as a 'yes',\" she gasps and he laughs, his lips travelling down her neck and then lower, and after that there's not much talking. With the data gathered, Neha realises that she likes sex. Maybe not all sex, but fucking Stuart is pretty great. Better than M rated fanfiction and a couple of shots, anyway, which was her alternative to tonight. She sits with her back to him as she pulls her shirt back on, the fabric suddenly feeling rough and uncomfortable against her skin. She can hear Stuart shifting behind her and thinks about how it felt to have him move beneath her, his hands clutching at her as she drew all sorts of noises out of him. \"Are you going already?\" he says, and Neha's sure it doesn't sound like a whine to him, but to her he's a puppy that's had his tail trodden on. \"Why?\" Neha teases, letting her hair fall over her shoulder. \"Do you want me to stay?\" \"Yeah,\" Stuart admits as he moves over to her, his fingers tracing the line of her shoulder. \"Please?\" Neha contemplates it, she honestly does, but she's never been a clingy person, virgin or not. \"We've got work tomorrow,\" she reminds him, standing up and pulling on her skirt. Stuart nods, accepting defeat. Neha beams as she walks into work the next morning. It's stupid and cheesy and something out of an indie movie starring Zooey Deschanel but what the hell? Neha's not even halfway through her twenties and she works in one of the best jobs in the world, and yeah, she had sex with Stuart. Again. Neha's a little bit in love with her life. She's the last one in the office to get to work and to her chagrin, everyone is on their phone. As she enters, Lyle looks up and beams at her. \"App's finished!\" he exclaims, \"Up for download this morning.\" Neha's got her phone out before he even finishes his sentence and is downloading Lyle's app, which as far as she can work out involves an airplane and a Google + connection. \"Awesome,\" Neha says with completely sincerity, and it's worth it to see the grin on Lyle's face. She's not really needed for the rest of the day, so she spends some time manning the pones. It's simple, mindless, work, but Neha likes it for that reason. Simple pleasures, she thinks, and drinks her free coffee. When she clocks off at the end of the day, she hangs around the foyer before heading home. She's not sure what she's waiting for but then Billy stumbles out of the bottom of a slide and Neha lets out a breath she didn't know she was holding. \"Neha!\" Billy exclaims, \"I haven't seen you around lately. What have you been doing?\" Neha shrugs. \"You know, work. Haven't had much time for anything else,\" she adds with a smile. Billy has this stupid look on his face like Neha making small talk is the most interesting thing he's ever heard, and he nods and it honest to god makes Neha feel better, which is ridiculous, because she obviously doesn't need the help of some almost middle-aged guy who may have got her this job. \"I've got a stack of work to do,\" he says, \"but you take care of yourself, alright?\" \"Yeah,\" Neha says and Billy walks off to do whatever Billy does in his spare time. Neha isn't alone. She knows that. She has siblings and friends and colleagues and that hobo that lives in the park across from her apartment and sometimes shouts abuse at her. Her phone buzzes. \" Hey\" is all the message from Stuart reads and Neha almost groans, because are they seriously going through this again, they're not fucking 14 years old. \" Hey\" she texts back anyway. You deprive someone of air and you kill them. This is general knowledge and common sense, and honestly it's how Neha feels right now. She doesn't know what's wrong- she's got a great job, amazing friends, supportive family, and let's be honest, Neha herself is pretty wonderful. And yet she feels like her ears are blocked, like that moment when your foot slips when you miss the last step. She doesn't work on Wednesdays, which is nice, because she has to catch up on Game of Thrones at some point. Her phone rings and her first words to Yo-Yo are \"I haven't showered in two days.\" \"You should probably work on that,\" he replies, \"maybe invest in some soap.\" \"Shut up,\" she laughs, and then \"So did you have a reason for calling?\" \"Yes, actually,\" he says, his voice now cautious. \"I'm not being rude, but what's up with you and Stuart?\" There's a slight hitch in Neha's voice when she asks \"Why do you say that?\" \"No real reason, he just keeps sending these constant texts asking if you've said anything to me, how you're doing, stupid stuff.\" \"Oh, really?\" Neha asks with a strained voice. \"Weird.\" They talk about how undeniably odd their mutual friend is and how time consuming their job is and how Lyle and his girlfriend are doing and whether it's weird to keep frogs in your flat. When she hangs up half an hour later, Neha's smiling and not feeling empty, she's brimming. She's watching anime when there's a knock on her door. It's not that late, she supposes, but it's always late when you're in your twenties with an unsteady sleep schedule. It's not really a surprise when Stuart is at the door, and she kisses him like she's been wanting to for ages and it's not a movie ending, but it's pretty close. ","Summary":" Why is this so long?

I'm just here to write a story* Finally, June could hear the much awaited sound of Ben's El Camino pull onto their street. Within seconds, she was out the door and jettisoning herself into Sam's waiting arms. He held her frame tightly, breathing in the familiar scent of her shampoo. Within a few moments, they were kissing, separating only after running out of breath to touch foreheads and entwine fingers. \"Come on, you guys! For Pete's sake, it's only been two days!\" Benny turned to Ruth. \"It's like they've been apart for two years or something.\" Ruthie smiled wistfully. \"I guess that's what love feels like.\" With that, her smile disappeared. \"Ben?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Could you stay and talk?\" Benny leaned in to kiss her. Sensing her apprehension, Benny met her eyes. \"Yeah. Yeah, sure.\" He followed her into the building.[Chapter 2] * Disclaimer: I do not own Benny and Joon, nor do I own any characters. I'm just here to write a story* One Week Earlier- \"Look, Benny, it's a good opportunity for him. I don't do this for all of my clients. If they want him in Portland...\" \"That's great! Look, I'll ask him about it.\" Benny punched the counter with excitement. \"Hey guys, Sam's getting booked in Portland!\" \"That's great, man!\" \"I'm not surprised, he's something else.\" Soon, however, the predictable questions seeped in. \"Will he want to go?\" \"Yeah, and I mean, will June let'im?\" \"Hey, hey,\" Benny said. \"It's not up to her. I'm asking Sam what he wants. If he wants to go, she can't hold him back. I won't let her.\" \"How long?\" Sam asked. The video store was dead on the Tuesday afternoon. Benny left his post at the car shop early to deliver the news. \"Well, this is just the one show, so probably two days.\" Sam frowned to himself. \"At most! Two days at most!\" \"I don't know, Benny. That's pretty far. And June...\" \"Hey, forget June for a second. This is your life. You need to start living it. You have potential! And it's only two days!\" Sam frowned again. \"Look, we'll talk to her together, okay?\" He sighed. \"Benny-\" \"No, I need to be there. I can talk to her.\"[Chapter 3] * Disclaimer: I do not own Benny and Joon, nor do I own any characters. I'm just here to write a story* \"Well, Sam wants to do it! You can't just keep him here! What do you expect of him? Huh?\" \"Then let him tell me! He doesn't need you putting words in his mouth!\" \"He does! This is huge for him! And you'd just say no!\" \"Then why don't you let me talk to Sam ? Why aren't you letting him talk? What are you, his agent?\" Sam sighed. Later that night, in bed, Sam nuzzled into June's neck. \"Sam?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Do you want to go?\" Sam stiffened a bit, before relaxing back into her. \"I want to try it. But only just this once. If it doesn't work...\" \"I want you to go. If you want to.\" \"It's two days.\" \"I will be okay.\" she said. Her voice held enough confidence for the both of them. Three days later, Sam and Ben packed up the El Camino and set off for Portland. June stood on the porch of the apartment building until the car was out of sight. Ruthie wrapped an arm around her. \"Let's go inside,\" she said, guiding June through the door to her apartment. June's eyes wouldn't leave the road.[Chapter 4] * Disclaimer: I do not own Benny and Joon, nor do I own any characters. I'm just here to write a story* Later that night, June stood in her kitchen, blankly staring at the canvas. \"Would you mind checking on her?\" Ben asked through the phone. \"I don't want Sam to worry.\" \"Right, Sam's the worried one. Okay, I'll see how she's doing.\" Ruthie knocked on June's apartment door. She heard footsteps shuffle towards the door. June answered, and Ruthie's eyes immediately left June's face to the paint splattered night shirt. \"Having trouble sleeping?\" June twitched, nodding her head to the left. \"A little.\" \"Me too. Let's go have some tea, would you like that?\" June nodded, following Ruthie to her apartment across the hall. \"It's... kind of odd. Now.\" June said, as she gingerly curled into Ruthie's couch. She crossed her arms. \"We haven't spent a night apart in...I...don't remember how to sleep without him.\" she shook her head. Ruthie tried to meet her eyes, but June's remained on a fixed spot on the floor as she attempted to wriggle herself into a more comfortable position. Ruthie smiled as she set the teas down on the coffee table. \"He'll be back tomorrow. 'Til then, let's try a sort of sleepover, okay?\" Finally, June's humored eyes met Ruthie's. \"I'm about 20 years too old for that. And, I've- I've never had one.\" \"Well, I think we can make an exception for tonight. Want to watch a movie?\" June looked away, with tinges of a smile on her lips. \"Sam had me watch \"The Apartment\" when I moved here.\" She looked up. \"Shirley MacLaine.\" Ruthie smiled. They were already rubbing off on eachother. \"I've never seen that one. Why don't we get it?\"[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I do not own Benny and Joon, or any of the characters. I just love June and Sam, and kind of have issues with Benny. He seemed to blame June for a lot of his own problems. I mean, she and Sam were the ones who could function in a healthy relationship! Benny was a mess with Ruthie on their date. And calling June crazy and insisting he knew best- was NOT okay. June may have a mental illness, but this does not make her incapable of love or decisions pertaining to her own life! I love this romantic comedy because it allowed for that growth in Benny to realize that the way he handled things with his sister was harming both of them more than helping her. But, unfortunately, I think he will also go a bit mad with that perceived freedom for awhile, make harmful decisions and hurt people before he realizes he's got his own issues. \"That was beautiful, man.\" Benny clapped Sam on the back. \" You are a born performer.\" \"Thanks, Ben.\" Sam stirred his ice water with a tiny umbrella. He sighed. The bar was loud and crowded. \"Hey, you okay?\" \"Ben,\" Sam looked up. \"When do we get to go home?\" \"Sam, we just got here! I don't want to drive back tonight! Look, I know you're worried about June, but I promise , she's fine. I asked Ruthie to check on her. Let's just have some fun tonight, okay? Great job!\" He clapped him on the back again, before leaving to order himself another drink. Sam sighed again. Ben didn't get it. He wasn't worried. He just missed her. He watched Benny flirt with women, and Ruthie immediately came to mind. Sam couldn't help but feel intense disappointment as he watched Benny chat up a woman with red lips and short, dark hair. Before seeing how Benny's impromptu date would go, he left the hotel bar for their room, brushing his teeth and changing into pajamas by 10. He sat on the bed with his hands on his knees, facing Ben's empty bed. By midnight, Benny still hadn't returned, so Sam went to bed. Benny finally stumbled in after 2, waking Sam from dreams of strange smelling pillows and unfamiliar sounds. \"Sleeping already?\" \"It's late,\" Sam said, pulling the covers off and eyeing the digital clock. \"Early.\" \"Well, I'd love to sleep,\" Benny crooned. \"But I gotta go first.\" Sam wrinkled his nose as Benny stumbled into the bathroom to relieve himself. When he came out, he dramatically fell onto the bed. Sam avoided looking towards him. Benny made things like that hard sometimes. \"Where were you?\" Sam asked. \"Out,\" said Benny. Sam nodded. \"Don't judge me, Sam. You never get tired of it? I mean, I know how June is. You can't know that she's the one you want. Not for sure. I know I'm not ready to be married to Ruthie. Not like she wants to ask me for my opinion.\" Benny pointed a finger at his chest. Both women wordlessly watched as the credits rolled over the screen. \"So you and my brother...\" \"Yes?\" \"How...is it?\" \"Oh. Fine, I guess.\" \"You don't sound fine.\" \"Well...he's just been...distracted lately. And he never wants to talk about where this is going.\" \"This?\" \"Our relationship. I mean, by now, I thought I'd be married. But it's fine. It's fun, most of the time. And Benny is handsome, funny, charming.\" June cocked her head, then looked up. \"Are you two in love?\" Ruthie laughed. June just stared. \"I guess I don't know. I don't know if anyone can tell this early on in a relationship.\" After a silence, June said \" I can.\" \"I am sure.\" Sam said. \"I always was.\" \"Bullshit. It's only been two months, how can you know?\" \"From the first time I saw her.\" \"No,\" Ben shook his head. \"No, sorry, that's just not how it works.\" Sam looked at Ben, but didn't say any more. Ben ran his fingers through his hair and stood up. He began to pace. \"I mean, I know, you like her, and I'm happy for you. I am. But you've got so much potential . Don't you ever wonder about dating someone more, I don't know, normal? Prettier? Easier?\" \"She's better than normal. She's perfect.\" \"Okay, alright, fine.\" Ben sighed, then gestured towards Sam. \"Don't you ever think about trying other girls? You seemed to have your pick tonight. Didn't it even occur to you to buy one a drink? See where it goes?\" Sam's brow furrowed. \"Like you did.\" \"No, well...yes.\" Ben sighed again. \"Look, I like Ruthie. I do , I just...don't you ever look at some other girl, and think 'hey, maybe I'd like her better?'\" \"No.\" Sam shook his head. \"No? No?! What about, I don't know, Ruthie?\" \"Ruthie is nice.\" Sam said. \"Yeah. And pretty.\" \"But there is no one like June.\" Ben stared at Sam from his bed. Ben's hands dangled lifelessly between his legs. \"I'm not a bad person.\" Sam sat silently on his bed. \"I just needed some time to think. I had to get away from her. She wanted to talk about our relationship, and I don't even know what I want.\" \"Have you told her that?\" \"Sam, women don't like hearing thing like that.\" \"But it's honest.\" Ben continued, ignoring Sam. \"I spent so long taking care of June, worrying about her problems. I couldn't have a relationship. She'd never have let me. Now, I spend two days away from Ruthie and I meet someone else. And I forget about her! I forget and I like it!\" \"Maybe it was never June.\" \"What?\" Ben's eyes snapped up, as if he forgot Sam was there. Sam's eyes met Benny's. \"Maybe June was never the problem.\" \"Benny still doesn't want us together.\" \"I don't know if it's that...\" \"I think he needs to leave us alone and focus on his own life!\" June shook with anger. \"I think he still needs to figure things out for himself.\" Ruthie agreed, hoping to soothe June. \"And I always thought you and Sam were wonderful together. I envy it. I don't see how he didn't see it.\" \"He's not as perceptive as he wants to be.\" June snorted. \"No, he's not.\" \"Is that part of the problem?\" \"What?\" \"With you two.\" \"I just don't know if I do want this, you know? Sheesh, I just got June out of the house!\" Ben sighed. \"I'm sorry, Sam. I shouldn't be talking like this to you. I've just been...\" he sighed. \"and I drank too much. Right? Don't mention any of this to them.\" Sam sighed, and nodded. As soon as Benny fell asleep, Sam snuck out of the room. He hurried down the hall to the payphone. \"June?\" \"Sam!\" \"I miss you.\" He could hear her sigh over the phone. \"You do?\" Sam nuzzled the phone. \"I miss you.\" \"Me too. How did it- how was it?\" \"Good.\" He nodded. \"Are you coming home?\" \"Benny says tomorrow.\" As they hung up, Sam rested his forehead on the wall. It would be a long night.

His social life had just expanded rapidly, as well as his career. And for the most part, these new friends of his are relatively tolerable. Now, with his new job, he was going to have to eventually train a group of new Google member (there was no way he was going to say \"Nooglers\") and he really had had his fill of that experience. Finally at the black mini van his pale fingers reached the handle, curving in preparation to pull, when he was stopped by a soft hand. \"Uhm, and maybe when we do go out sometime, could it be… a date?\" Neha questioned shyly. Oh. Well this was going to be very uncomfortable for both of them. Rubbing the back of his head, the beanie eyed boy turned to face her. \"You're a really nice girl- she smiled at him happily. \"but-\" the smiled completely dropped, \"I'm kind of really gay. It's no offense, and I would, really, but I like…\" he was struggling with finding words now, tangled in guilt. \"…dicks.\" he finished lamely, internally wincing at his own choice of words. Holding in with glistening eyes, she gave him an encouraging (really more embarrassed) smile, weak at best. \"it's okay, really. I should go.\" She rushed, now skittering off as fast as her legs would carry her. \"Why the sour mood?.\" He heard the naturally aristocratic voice muse, tone practically oozing smugness, even after failing epically. Some people never learn. Without evn turning to face the pompous boy, he displayed what is his favorite finger. \"Fuck off.\" \"Oh, why? What have I ever done to you besides letting bask in my presence?\" Graham retorted arrogantly, frustrating Stuart enough to turn. \"Oh I don't know? Maybe it's just me, but I feel that being a raging dick speaks for itself.\" He remarked dully. \"What? I thought you said you like dicks?\" He stiffened. He heard that? Shit. He had only come out to a few people. It's not as hough he was uncomfortable with being gay, he really just didn't need the whole world to know. He really didn't need his personal life out there. To anyone. And definitely not to him of all people. \"You heard that?\" He said casually, now try to seem very nonchalant about the matter. To no avail, as he saw the spark of interest in the failed googlers eye. Oh great. Just great. He was now internally berating himself for even asking that. Of course he heard that dipshit! \"Oh? A little sexuality shy? Well it's okay. You aren't the only one who is attracted to the superior gender. Attractive men or women, they can all be used to your advantage.\" he said deviously, now making eye contact- which to Stuarts utmost displeasure- made him squirm a little where he stood. \"Okay, so I'm not sure if you understood the original 'Fuck Off', but I guess that just means I'll have to take the matter into my own hands.\" He said to comprnsate for his underlying nerves. \"I'm so glad I won't have to see you ever again.\" And as he drove away, he saw the boy smirk and heard him laugh loudly all the way out. What he didn't hear was the mumble of: \"That's what you think.\" Author's Note: Ugh, I know! I can't write long chapters for crap. But hey, I used to write 200 word per chapter stories before I wrote fanfiction. Not pretty.

I will be updating this week, and can only hope you can find forgiveness. Dearest apologies, -Sinner[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I don't own The Internship. Oh great. Stuart thought, looking at the large group of kids vying for an internship at Google. It looked like Graham had thrown up all over them. Noses pointed high in the air, no definition of 'casual-wear', and a consistant look of super- OH SHIT. There standing before him, was a face he hadn't planned on seeing again. The now all-too-common-acting man of the hour. As if he knew exactly where Stuart would be, he looked up durectly at him and smirked. Arrogant asshole. After the speach (that both didn't seem to be paying attention to) was over, he kept staring, brushing off all and any offers of only a few people remained. What is he doing? And then it hit him. There obviously weren't teachers for every group, this was an attempt at a more independent group effort, but ofcourse they just had to have a guide for the kids considered 'left-over'. And that's where Stuart came in. And apparentally, that's where Graham was deciding to include himself too. But why? He was struck out of his musings as he was tapped roughly on the shoulder, and looked at expectantly. Graham was still waiting for him, smirk, lifted eyebrows, and all. After receiving a hurry-up-you-idiot glare, he cleared his throat and took as he took a step forward, only the eyes of the rag tags extras on him, the only one's to currently notice him. Without looking back he walked up the steps past the groups and called out: \"Leftovers, come with me!\" with a sense of familiarity, gesturing to them with his right hand lifted. they all followed like eager lost puppies. All except Graham, acting as though he was king of the fucking world, taking his sweet time in making his way to the group. No surprise there. Finally get to the leftovers room- the room he had come to both despise and be fond towards- and took the immediately closest seat. \"Okay newbies-\" And Graham, he internalized \"-you are assigned your first task. We want you to create something. The only requirement is it has to be running on a form of electricity.\" As they looked on with relief, he grinned. \"But-\" this had them groaning. \"It has to be made from the supplies within this room, anything here, but only here.\" he finished, gesturing to the room. \"And… Go!\" They were scattering like ants, scrambling around opening drawers, pulling out supllies and setting them on the table, finding only highlighters, protractors, and pencils. While searching for better utilities, a loud 'snap' boomed through the room. The group turned to see Graham holding a smashed open computer. \"What you idiots? He said anything in the room, and we need wires.\" The accented boy snapped. This got the group going, a mousy looking young boy ripping chunks of wood and legs of the desk with a metal chair. With a battle cry, a larger girl all but ripped the white board off the wall, using a curved metal pointer as a crowbar. And of course, there was the master mind himself, eyes crinkled with a smug victory as he pulled wires from their piles, here and there taping some together. Hmm… maybe he is learning Stuart mused, staring at the smooth expanse of the boys face. He nearly reared back thoughwhen he saw the dark amused eyes looking back at him. Fighting to keep composure, he turned his look to a glare and turned them quickly downcast, trying to act like he didn't feel the blush creeping up his neck. Out of the corner of his eye, he could almost swear the boy was staring at him now. But he wouldn't. I mean, why would he? Author's Note: I'm back! Okay so I know the chapter is short, but I have a really long plan for the next chapter, so don't you worry! Also, I am updating all of my stories today! Woo!

Those cold eyes that seemed so gentle when you first came into my life. I had always had an idea that blue meant safe, yet judging by my current situation I must admit I was wrong. You asked if I wanted anything before the bet was won. I think about this, looking at the chaos around me. Blood splattered against our pale walls, Toby was motionless beside me, slowly I reach out to him grasping his lukewarm hand. He was only eight, never would he know the touch of a girl, or go to his first dance, drive, he would never live again. You watch my every movement as I stroke his dark hair, staring into those perfect chocolate eyes that always had a certain brightness to them. I feel my eyes sting, more tears? Is that possible, I would have thought you had beaten all of them out of me. My clothes are gone, I realize it's the first time guys have ever seen me naked. My thoughts wonder, what will the police think when they see all of this. I hope it's a person without a family so they do not have to dwell on the fact that Toby could have been their brother or son, that this broken girl covered in blood and bruises everywhere may have been their lover, daughter, sister, friend. I do not want them to feel bad that it was us instead of them, I want them to know that I do not blame them one bit for it. I would not wish this even upon you, despite all of the torture you and him have cause for my family I still refuse to hate you. I cannot... I should want you both dead, I shouldn't feel any compassion, yet I do. A gasp of breath leaves my mouth and I taste a hot salty metallic liquid on my tongue gagging me. \"Hello! Do you want anything?\"you shout shaking me roughly. He lifts me into a chair, I cling to him out of reflex needing something solid to hold before I float away. I look into your face. How can someone my age be capable of such monstrosities? You said you've done this before? I'm not the only to suffer this sorrow? I suddenly realize what I want \"I-...\" My voice cracks, but you glue yours eyes to my face. You truly are beautiful, both of you. \"promise me you won't do this to anyone else, kill me however you want... Just don't put another family through this. Please.\" You actually look surprised by my comment mouth slightly ajar. He watches me with curiosity. \"So selfless... Do you know what you are even offering?\" your voice calm. Always calm. My head spins as I nod. I want this. Any and all pain if I can spare another person this agony. You rise and kneel in front of me kissing me lightly on the forehead, I expect icy lips from a person with a stone heart, but they are warm and tender against my pounding head. He comes beside you and smiles also placing a kiss on my cheek so lightly I'm not even sure if he actually touched me. \"You are like no other I have ever seen. I promise you are the last.\" You hold my hand tightly and give me a reassuring smile. The pain comes next, hot burning pain in my back. He drags a blade across my shoulder while you punch me in the stomach. I let out a scream, but refuse to say stop. I want to fill this void you have deep inside you. I look into those eyes, your eye that both fascinate and terrify. In them I find comfort. Even though I know your promise to be false, I need to believe that I'm dying for a reason. If not to save my family then another. I cannot die knowing it was for nothing. I feel the blade break my skin, draining my life, I hear the screams and moans leave my lips, taste the blood forming in my throat, but all I see are your blue eyes. Paste your document here...

That does it hurt? I scream? It confuses me. I can not think clearly. He shot my brother. Before my eyes. Just like that. I wanted to scream, wanted to run away, stop him. But I did nothing of the sort. I just stood there after it was over. His accomplice held me back. I could not move. But I felt it yet. The blood, the only thing I have left of him. But he was still a child. Why did he have to die? Because it was part of their game. They enjoy. The blood ran down my cheek. I kept staring at his body. Dead and bloodied, he lay there. Tot. His killer looked at me. His ice-blue eyes flashed. Cold and unpredictable. The gun still in hand, he came up to me. The blood of my brother stuck to his shirt and on parts of his face. \"You should wash you.\" He looked at me the whole time here. His partner, who resigned after he pressed the gun in his hand. \"I will accompany.\" I knew I just could not resist. He would do what he wanted. I slowly sat down on the move and felt about him all the time behind me. After we had climbed the wooden stairs, I wanted to stop, but his hand on my shoulder pushing me forward. We reached the bathroom and I froze as he locked the door and found himself close behind me. His breath grazed my neck and I instantly stiffened. I heard him rummaging around in the cupboards. I did not dare turn around me. He turned on the water and a short time later I felt something wet on my hand. He had taken towel and started my body to get rid of the blood. While he touched me with the towel, but prepared himself as if by a tingling sensation in my mind's made. Only one The only time he drove casually with his fingers on mine. I felt heat and cold. Which body was cold? What was burning with heat? I did not know. There was far too soon. eliminated when the blood on my arms, he turned me over. I avoided looking at him. The tingling would not stop and I did not wanted to foment further. He began to clean my face. Still, I managed not to look up. When he arrived at my lips, he stopped. I did not know what he was doing, but I wanted to find out, so I looked him in the eye. Something inside was different. I could not explain it, but it left me no peace. He dropped the towel and stared at me. And then slowly he bent down and touched his lips with mine. I was not frightened. It seemed like I had seen his intention in his eyes. I could not at first only interpret. His lips were soft. He moved so easily and slowly against my own, I felt that I was not sure if this was ever real. His hands hung at his sides, and still he tried not once to touch me with anything except his mouth. I did not know whether I should return the kiss. He had shot my brother before my eyes and now he kissed me. I should hate him, push him from me. But I could not. It was a complete mystery to me why, the only thing that mattered was that I could not. As if by moving my lips in a consistent rhythm with his. As he slowly let go of me, my eyes remained closed. My lips felt funny, as would be missing something. I carefully opened it and looked into his icy blue eyes. I did not know what was going on in this moment with me, but I took the towel from his hand and started to clean up his arms. At first I wondered if I should look at him the whole time, but I knew I would just melt under his gaze and my clumsiness would be unstoppable. When it was time to clean his face, I hesitated a moment, then leaned forward and kissed the blood stains from his skin. I did not know what drove me to do this. But in his sole presence I felt safe in a strange way that I could even explain nor understand. After some time I was finished, staring at his lips, which still were covered with blood. My mind did not react as it should, but my body knew it only too well. I bridged the final gap between us and kissed him. It was different than the kiss we had shared even a few minutes together. My arms wrapped around his neck by itself. I was afraid that I went too far, but then he touched me with his icy fingers, and I shuddered. His hands wandered in my T-shirt, but did not come close to my bra. They painted little circles on my skin. Meanwhile, I opened my lips a little and granted him entry after he had gone short with his tongue on my lip. I pressed myself closer to him, forgetting everything around me. Whoever he was, what he had done and what he would do. Everything dissolved into air. After hours, he felt separated from my now slightly swollen lips and looked at me. We were engulfed still tight and I felt as if he would see right through me. He let go of me and I knew it was over. That one moment he had spent with me and that was more than he could expect me and justify it to themselves. When we were down again, everything would be forgotten. I knew I would not be allowed to do, but I melted under his gaze and I was too weak to release myself from it. So it came to an end. Painlessly and without much blood. When he came, he said that he would kill me. I was not afraid. ","Summary":" I do not know what I expected. That does it hurt? I scream? It confuses me.

I eyed him suspiciously- I saw him and another preppy looking guy on the drive to these, expensive rental summer houses. They were with friends of my dad's, the Loreans, but no one knew who they were exactly. \" Why do you need the eggs, if I may ask?\" I questioned. I had a bad feeling about him- he was a little too polite. He smiled at me, which I shivered at- I don't need another dude giving me a creeper smile. \"Oh, right, sorry. I was sent here by Mrs. Lorean- she said that she needed them for something.\" I squint at him. Sure she did . \"Alright, \"I say, not wanting to be too rude to the guy. As long as he was here for a damn good reason- I was in the middle of emailing my girlfriend back home. I let the guy in and head to the kitchen, keeping an ear out for him moving. He followed me slowly and quietly, his footsteps barely noticeable. There wasn't much eggs in the carton so I asked him how many. He said only four. \"Wow, you lucked out. There's exactly four in here.\" \"Great.\" He smiled at me again . Eww. I gave him the eggs and showed him back to the door, though he didn't leave immediately. \"Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Peter.\" The guy reached out to shake my hand and, since I really jut wanted to get back to doing what I was previously occupied with, I shook it. \"Nice to meet you, Peter. I'm Ethan.\" As Peter shook my hand back, he dropped the egg carton on the floor, allowing several to crack and spill their contents all over the carpet. \"Aw, shit!\" I exclaimed. Mom'll freak when she sees a yoke stain on the carpet! \"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" Peter said apologetically. \"Would you like some help?\" I sighed. \"No, I'll just do it by myself. But we don't have any more eggs.\" There was a knock on the door. \"Who is it?\" I shouted, a little rude, but I couldn't just get up and leave the eggs and some stranger in the middle of the house. \"Paul,\" Peter stated happily. Must be a friend. The Paul person let himself in- it was the other guy I saw with the Loreans earlier. \"Hello,\" he says to me. \"Hi,\" I say not-too-enthusiastically. \"Oh, yeah, y'know, it's cool, just let yourself in and all,\" I mumbled to myself as he casually looked around at all our things. I hope they aren't thieves. Paul walks up to me as I put the broken shells back in the carton and stand up. He puts a hand out to shake. What's with these guys-who shakes hands any more? \"Hi, I'm Paul.\" I nod and say, \"Ethan,\" back to him, then shake after rubbing the slimy fluid on my jeans. He looked down, noticing the shattered eggs. \"Are those the eggs?\" \"Uh, yeah. I mean, they're broken now, so I guess you don't want them any more…\" \"Are there more?\" \"No. That was it, sorry. Peter dropped them by accident.\" He looked accusingly at Peter. \"Ugh. I knew I should have come over myself, now look what you did, Tom. Mrs. Lorean will never get her eggs now.\" \"I'm sorry. They just slipped,\" the other answered quietly. I looked confused at them. \"Wait…did you just call him Tom? I thought his name was Peter?\" \"That's what I called him,\" Paul lied smoothly. \"No, you didn't. You said Tom.\" He chuckled lightly. \"You don't believe me?\" \"Hell no.\" \"Well, that's not very nice to say. We just met and you already think I'm a liar. That's not very nice, now, is it, Peter?\" \"Not very nice, \"Peter repeated softly, smiling again. \"Look, I don't care if I'm not being nice or whatever, but I know what you said, alright?\" He looked extremely amused. What is their deal? \"Look, man, if you're gonna' be a weirdo, go do it some where else- waste someone else's time, okay?\" I quickly threw the eggs in the trash can and opened the door for them, gesturing with my hand for them to leave. \"Come on now. I don't have time for your crap.\" For a moment, Peter (or Tom, whoever the hell he was) and Paul looked at each other. Neither moved. That pissed me off. I stride over to Peter, who was watching me like an injured pup. I try to take him to the door as an example for Paul. As I was amidst tugging the man to the door, my parents came down with my little sister, Jamie, trotting down after them. \"Ethan, honey, what are you doing? Who are they?\" My mother asked, pushing Jamie back. \"No one, Mom. They were just leaving.\" Peter was trying to hold his ground, and since he was bigger than me, I couldn't move him very far. Paul, on the other hand, went to greet my family like they were to be good friends. \"Hello, I'm Paul. You must be Mr. Curtis.\" My dad nodded, being a man of few words. \"Do you boys need something?\" I glare at my father. \"Dad!\" He simply raised a hand to em and I stopped pulling at Peter's arm. I can't go against him. \"I just came for some eggs,\" Peter stated quietly. \"Your son gave me some, but I broke them.\" \"Since when did it take two people to run an errand?\" My dad asks. \"I just came here to find my friend Tom over there,\" Paul pointed to Peter. \"Oh my God ,\" I groan loudly. \"Will you stop it ?\" Paul looked innocently at me. \"Stop what?\" \"Dad!\" \"Ethan, calm down. What has you so riled up?\" I run my hand over my face. \"This guy,\" I point at Peter, \"his name isn't Tom- he told me it was Peter ! But this guy,\" I pointed at Paul, \"keeps calling him Tom !\" Paul and my dad exchange looks. \"He's been Tom since I can remember, sir,\" he says earnestly. This dude's really rubbing me the wrong way! My dad is now confused- I can see it in his face. He knows I don't lie to him, but he doesn't know who's right. My mom decides to step in now. \"Um, I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding boys, but maybe you should go.\" \"What misunderstanding, ma'am? I only came here for eggs,\" Peter pleaded. Mom looked as though she sympathized with him. Jamie tried to wriggle past her to see what was going on. I took action again, this time being even more forceful. \"Well, too damn bad; you broke them , remember? Now get out or I'm calling the cops!\" I threaten, pulling out my cell phone from my pocket. Next thing I know, I'm tackled to the ground and my arm is twisted up in an awkward angle, making me drop the phone. I screamed out.[Chapter 2] I screamed out. \"Are you okay?\" Peter asks over me immediately after attacking. I gasp at the pain in my shoulder as I move my arm back down- my shoulder and my back were pounding. Hell no I'm not okay! \"Tubby, you can't go throwing all your weight on other people. Someone could get seriously hurt,\" Paul mused. Peter helped me up, apologizing. \"I'm sorry, but you can't call the police on guests. That's just plain rude.\" He is oblivious to my glares. Mom, Dad and Jamie all rushed over to me. Peter and Paul stood back to watch. After confirming that I was only slightly injured, we all looked towards the extremely unwinding guest. \"What do you want? Why don't you just leave?\" Dad asks on edge; now he begins to see why my gut tells me they are bad news. \"Why won't we leave ?\" Paul repeats. \"We just got here. Come on, surely you wouldn't shove every guest through your door like this.\" We don't respond. Peter sits down on the arm chair as Paul leans against the wall closet to us. \"All we want to do is play a game,\" Paul says slowly. \"It's a fun game, I promise.\" He smiles at us expectantly. \"Yes? Will you play?\" There was a moment of silence. \"What do you want us to do?\" My father asks. \"So you will play, then?\" Paul sounded…pleased. Dad doesn't say anything. Mom sighs. \"We will do whatever you want, just… leave , okay?\" Neither answer, but they both smile those polite little smirks. \"That's awesome,\" Paul says. \"Now let's begin with a formal introduction, shall we? Good evening. My name is Paul, and this is Peter.\" Peter waves at us, smiling. He looks expectantly at us again. No one did anything. \"Come on, were you all raised in a barn? What are your names ?\" Noticing Paul's face getting more and more angered, I tried to comply by giving him our names. \"I'm Ethan. This is Jamie. That's our mother, Theresa, and our father, Philip,\" I answered with a dead edge to my voice.. I sigh and close my eyes. \"Why are you doing this?\" \"Why are we doing this, Tubby,\" he calls out to Peter. \"I don't know,\" Peter says in his quiet voice. How do you not know why you're doing this? Paul \"tsked\" him. \"Now, Tubby, what kind of an example are you setting for these people by breaking the rules? You know why.\" Peter moved his mouth to the side thoughtfully. It looked like he was thinking over whether or not to answer. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" We all watched Paul speak quietly to Peter, whose face grew red and eyes watery. \"Fine then, I'll tell them.\" Paul turned to us now. \"You see, Peter's father used to beat him- all the time, for little things. And his mother was a loose cannon. A different guy every night when his dad was at work.\" Peter was sobbing now, but Paul continued. \"When they were done with his mom, they would sneak into his room and-\" \"Shut up!\" I screamed. Jamie was gripping my leg for dear life and crying. \"You're scaring her,\" I stated, picking up my little sister. Paul put on a concerned look. \"If it's any consolation to you, everything I said wasn't true.\" \"Can you just…stop?\" Mom asked. \"But your little soldier asked a question, ma'am, and every question deserves an answer.\" \"Please,\" she begged. Paul smiled widely, clapping like Mom had a break through. \"That's great. You know, the game is much easier when manners are involved. So what would you like to hear?\" \"The truth,\" Dad hissed through gritted teeth/ \"Easy enough. Why are we really here, Tom?\" Peter had stopped crying and was wiping his face with a handkerchief. \"Because we can,\" he said with a chipper tone. \"Exactly,\" Paul praised, \" because we can .\" He signaled for us to come into the living room and take seats. I sat next to Dad on the sofa with Jamie in my lap. Peter politely gave his seat to my mother and joined Paul to lean against the wall. I wince as Jamie lets her head drop on to previously injured shoulder. \"Does it hurt badly? \" Peter questioned quietly. \"I'll be fine.\" I didn't word it to come off as rude, but the way I said it was more like, \"well, if some fat guy didn't just jump me and jack up my shoulder, I'd be a lot better.\" He goes on. \"I'm sorry I had to hurt you, but you were going to call the cops on us. That wasn't very friendly of you, you must admit.\" I don't though; if I tell you to leave my house, you leave or else . Simple as that. \"You really shouldn't go throwing yourself on others, Tom,\" Paul says casually. \"It could give others the wrong impression of us.\" Peter laughed. \"What's the problem if they'll end up dead anyway?\" \"Tubby, that is so rude! \" \"But it's true!\" \"Well, either way, it's no excuse to forget manners.\" My family and I listened to them bicker in silence. I could feel Jamie gradually relaxing on me; being relatively young, she took naps quite frequently during the day. I rubbed her back soothingly as she begins snoring softly. This interrupted their conversation and Paul looked rather surprised. \"You can't fall asleep in the game. Please wake her up.\" \"She's a little kid- she needs her sleep,\" I say on her behalf. \"She's an asset to your team. Believe me when I say I sympathize, but she must stay awake, otherwise well have to penalize her and you don't want that.\" I looked incredulous at him. \" Penalize a five year old for sleeping? What's wrong with you?\" \"Oh, nothing really. It's just, those are the rules and where would modern civilization be without rules?\" \"Anarchy,\" Peter answered. \"Exactly. Thank you, Tom.\" \"You're welcome, Jerry.\" \"We'd be in anarchy if we didn't follow the rules, Ethan. I can't bend them any more than you.\" He signaled to Jamie and I reluctantly shook her awake. \"Hey, Tubby what time is it?\" Peter frowns. \"Stop calling me Tubby.\" Paul rolled his eyes, mumbling under his breath. \"It's nine twenty-three,\" he says after checking his wrist watch. Paul questions the statement, saying how time flies when you're having fun. \"It's about time we place our bets, eh, Beavis?\" They both walked to the middle of the room like what they had to say would interest us. \"What bet,\" Dad questions, worry plastered on his face. \"Okay,\" Paul began. \"We bet that in twelve hours, so about nine thirty, that you all will be... dead .\" \"What?\" Mom breathes.

When her mother insisted that she join her family on their trip to the vacation house, Andi put up as much a fight as she could. But Amanda Sorrel's tenacity was unmatched, and Andrea was forced to succumb. To make matters worse, days before they left she came down with the flu. The drive down was spent in feverish hallucinations. What took only a few hours felt like days of staring at the ceiling of the car as she lay curled in the backseat. Alexis, her little sister, hopped around the seat in front of her, full of energy at barely 7 years old, and Amanda and Aaron sat in the front discussing some political event or other. Andi never listened anyway. She put her iPod on full blast and tried to drown out the headache. As soon as they pulled up, Amanda shooed her eldest daughter up to her room, with strict instructions not to come down until the flu had passed. After a little while, Andi was brought some soup by her father, and she fell into the deep sluggish sleep of the ill. Normally the days at their nice cabin in the mountains were spent outside hunting or sledding or skiing. But since they had arrived late, Aaron, Amanda, and Alexis were going to spend their first night watching a movie. Aaron and Alexis unpacked the rest of the luggage as Amanda stood in the kitchen making popcorn and getting drinks when there care a knock at the door. \"Who could that be?\" Amanda wondered. Standing on her porch were two young boys, not much older than Andi. They were dressed all in white, looking like they were about to go golfing. It seemed an odd way to dress this time of year, but Amanda barely thought of it. \"Can I help you?\" she asked. The taller, more confident one spoke. \"Yes, ma'am. We were wondering if you had a map we could look at. We're terribly lost, you see, and haven't the slightest clue where we are.\" He spoke in a calm pleasing tone, and was very polite. The first instinct Amanda had was to tell him no, but as she couldn't understand why she had this instinct, she simply ignored it and invited them inside. \"No, ma'am. I couldn't intrude.\" \"Please, come in. You must be cold, dressed like that in winter.\" She noted as they stepped inside. \"We barely notice it, and its difficult to find clothing we enjoy more. We are all creatures of habit, after all.\" He trailed off as Amanda went in search of the map and Alexis came skipping into the entrance way. \"Mom, where's the popcorn? Dad says we're done unpacking and I wanna watch the movie.\" Then she noticed the boys standing there looking curiously at her. \"Who's this?\" \"I'm Paul and this is Peter. We're lost. Your mom's gone to find us a map.\" He smiled. \"Well I'm sure Daddy can give you directions. Daddy!\" she called to him in the other room. \"Alexis, don't yell. You wouldn't want to wake-\" he was stopped short by the presence of the young boys. \"Um, hello.\" \"Daddy, they're lost. They say Mom went to go find a map.\" Paul extended his hand. \"Hello, sir. My name's Paul and this is Peter.\" Aaron shook it hesitantly. \"Aaron. Aaron Sorrel. This is Alexis and you've already met my wife Amanda it seems.\" At that moment, Amanda returned. \"I'm sorry, I can't seem to find one.\" Paul and Peter both smiled as Paul said \"That's quite all right. We didn't really come here for that.\" Amanda and Aaron looked at each other in concern. Aaron decided to take command as he said, \"Well if that's all then...\" and gestured towards the door. \"I'm sorry?\" Paul seemed confused. \"It that's all we can do you for, than have a nice evening.\" Aaron gestured for the door again. \"I'm sorry, I don't understand. Did we do something to offend you?\" \"Quite the contrary, you've been polite and its been a pleasure. I would like, however to watch a movie with my family so if there's nothing else we can do for you, I'd like you to leave.\" At this they both chuckled. Peter spoke for the first time. \"Leave? Thats highly unlikely.\" \"Mr. Sorrel, I don't understand why you are being so rude.\" Paul interjected. \"I'm not being rude. I'm simply ending your visit. Now please...\" and once again he gestured for the door, only this time he grabbed Peter's arm and pushed him a little way. As he did so, Paul drew back his arm and his Aaron so hard that he fell against the wall and hit his head. When he brought his head forward, there was a newly formed splatter of blood on the wall. Amanda ran to his side as Alexis yelled \"Daddy!\" and Peter stood holding the little child back as she kicked and screamed at Paul. \"Everyone needs to calm down.\" Paul's voice raised above the others, then lowered calmly. \"Now, I'm very sorry, but it was quite rude of you to grab Tubby like that, I'm sure you'd agree. Mrs. Sorrel, you'd probably want to get a towel to put against the wound and Mr. Sorrel, you and little Alexis should have a seat in the living room. And let's all stay calm shall we?\" He said this last phrase cheerfully, as though reassuring party guests after a cup has been broken, not victims to his devious games. \"Tubby, help Mrs. Sorrel.\" \"My name isn't Tubby.\" \"Fine. Go help her.\" Paul followed Aaron and Alexis into the living room and Peter watched as Amanda grabbed a towel and wet it before following her into the living room as well. The three Sorrels sat on the sofa as Paul and Peter took their place on the love seat across them. \"Now, be sure to put pressure on the wound, Amanda - can I call you Amanda?\" \"What do you want?\" she asked bitterly. \"Well Amanda, we want to play a little game.\" Paul said as Peter chuckled. \"Look, just take whatever you want and leave.\" \"Like I said before, Mrs. Sorrel, thats highly unlikely,\" Peter smirked. \"Tubby, what time is it?\" Paul asked. \"9:30\" \"Okay, so let's make a bet. Let's say at 10:00 tomorrow morning, you three will all be dead.\" \"What?\" Aaron spoke for the first time since he fell. \"Yeah, you guys bet you'll be alive, we bet you, well, won't be.\" He laughed. \"What kind of bet is that?\" Amanda asked angrily. \"My favorite kind. So the bet is on then, yes? Yes! What should we do till then?\" \"I could use something to eat.\" Peter said innocently. \"Alexis, would you like to take Tubby here to find some food?\" Paul asked the frightened little girl. \"Don't worry, Amanda, he'll take good care of her.\" As Alexis stood up, Amanda grabbed her and hugged her daughter tight as she whispered in Alexis' ear \"Don't mention Andi.\" Alexis nodded as Peter led her off. \"What did you tell her just then,\" Paul asked. \"What do you mean?\" Amanda lied. \"You know. You whispered something. What was it?\" \"I was telling her to behave, and do what you say. I don't want her to get hurt.\" \"Excellent advice. This is going quite well. It's easier when things are polite.\"[Chapter 2] \"It's easier when things are polite,\" Paul said with a wide grin. Aaron tried to say something but it came out as a gargled mumble as he was slowly losing consciousness. \"Mr. Sorrel, you should really save your energy. You're gonna need ti.\" \"What are you playing at?\" Amanda couldn't hide the disgust in her voice as she held the cloth to her husband's head. \"Playing at, Amanda? Oh, we're not playing yet. Ah,\" he said as Peter followed Alexis into the room. \"Did you find anything good?\" \"No.\" Peter replied bitterly. \"They don't have anything to eat, and the stupid kid spilled juice on my hand.\" Alexis sat next to her mother as Peter flopped down next to Paul. \"All right, now that everyone's here, let's play a game. Let's call it...\" and at this he exchanged knowing looks with Peter, \" 'Where are Daddy's toys?' I assume you're the hunting type, right?\" He nodded at Aaron. \"Don't answer. Like I said, save your energy. But I'm sure Mommy knows where he keeps his tools. So, Lexi, you're gonna stay here with Peter and Daddy. Amanda, give Lexi the cloth. You have to hold that on Daddy's head, all right. Tubby, don't lose your temper. Everybody play nice, while Mommy shows me where Daddy's toys are, okay?\" When no one replied, he smiled and exclaimed \"Great. After you Amanda.\" She stared at him in disbelief, till he pulled her off the couch and said again, \"After you.\" Amanda led him out of the living room, and into the entrance hall. \"Well? Where do we go now?\" \"If you think I'm going to willingly give you the weapons to kill my husband and my little girl, you're crazier than I thought.\" \"I never said anything about 'willing,' Mrs. Sorrel. You're forgetting who holds all the cards. If you want me to play my hand, I will. But don't forget what you're betting.\" As he said this, he looked purposefully at Alexis. \"Amanda, you three will die. Its rather inevitable. How you die is entirely up to you. Play nice, and you'll die nice. Play mean...\" he left the thought hanging for Amanda to finish. When Amanda didn't move, Paul sighed. \"Fine, I'll find it myself. Let's start upstairs.\" Ignoring the sudden look of horror on her face, he pushed her ahead of him and started up the stairs. Amanda followed behind as Paul opened various doors, starting with the master bedroom. \"So, does Aaron keep a gun in here. A lot of people do. Like under the pillow.\" He looked. Nothing. \"Perhaps in the closet.\" Again. Nothing. \"No matter. I'm looking for the hunting equipment, not the self-defense pistol. Let's try another room, shall we?\" Amanda held her breath as he opened another door. \"Ah, this must be Lexi's room.\" On the bed was a pink comforter with green and purple flowers. The room was adorned with other various items you would expect in a little girl's room. \"I like it. It's very....pink. Its also very child friendly, so I won't find anything in here. How about...across the hall. What's in here?\" \"No! I, mean, um...\" She fumbled to cover when Paul turned to look at her. \"Um, I'll take you to them. The weapons, I mean. I'll show you.\" He smiled. \"Well I'm glad you're playing nice now. But now I'm intrigued as to what's in this room. So, let's have a look!\" And he threw open the door. Along the walls were a dresser and a desk. The walls were covered in various posters of bands and movies. There was a shelf with some books, movies, cds, and games. Nothing special. But what drew the attention of both Amanda's and Paul's eyes was the bed in the middle of the room, and the unconscious body lying wrapped in the covers on it. Paul cocked his head to the side. \"Well then, who's this?\" he asked himself quietly. He moved to the bed. Amanda just cried. Paul gently brushed the girl's hair aside. Andi's eyes flittered open. She yawned. \"Who are you?\" At this he smiled. \"I'm the man that's going to kill your family.\" In her feverish state this statement barely registered. She just turned over and mumbled, \"Close the door, you're letting the light in.\" Paul quietly got up and pushed Amanda into the hall, locking the door behind him. \"So, who was that?\" Knowing she had no choice, she softly replied, \"My eldest daughter, Andrea\" \"And why was Andi not around for our games?\" \"She's sick. Had a fever.\" \"That explains why she didn't hear what I said. All right then, where are the weapons?\" Amanda didn't have the energy to resist anymore. All she wanted to do was sit down. \"Fine. They're in the basement, locked in a cabinet. The key in under the stairs.\" He smiled again, that sickening smile. \"Very good. You look tired Amanda. Why don't you go sit with Peter in the living room.\" He followed her downstairs then continued on to the basement as Amanda sat down next to her husband and took the towel from Lexi. Moments later, Paul returned with a shotgun and several bullets. \"Hey Tubby. They give you any trouble?\" \"No trouble. They're quite quiet actually.\" \"You will not believe what I found upstairs. Lexi's big sister, Andi.\" \"And what was she doing upstairs?\" \"Sleeping off a fever. I locked her door and left her there.\" He said as he loaded the shotgun. \"Shouldn't we bring her down?\" \"That wouldn't be fair. After all the bet was that these three would be dead. We never said a thing about her. I think we can decide what to do with her later. And speaking of the bet, what time is it?\" Peter looked at his watch. \"1:26.\" \"All right. Let's see about winning the bet shall we. I have an idea. Let's guess how old Andi is. I'm guessing.....16. Maybe 17. Let's say 17. Tubby, who should we start with?\" \"Why are we using Andi?\" \"Because it's more fun that way. Now I say we start with little sister. All right? Great! Start counting Tubby.\" \"I'm not Tubby.\" \"Whatever. Start counting.\" Peter started at Lexi who was sitting on the right end of the couch, then went on to Amanda, who was sitting at the left end, and then Aaron was in the middle. \"One, two, three, four...\" ","Summary":" She didn't want to go. When her mother insisted that she join her family on their trip to the vacat"},{"Movie":"Internship","Title":"Red","Author":"ChasingWolves","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9639961","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter one Checking myself over in the flip down mirror of my blue Honda Civic for the final time I readjusted the bobby pins that were keeping my hair back and reapplied my apple cinnamon flavored lip glass, my gray eyes met my reflection taking in my appearance down to the dangly brown feathered earrings I wore. I didn't need to look down to see my light blue sleeveless dress that almost reached down to my knees, with a thin brown belt around my waste and matching brown four inch heels. Slipping out of my car I reached in to grab my laptops white leather bag, before closing and locking the door. Turning my breath stalled in my lungs as I took in the site of the huge Google building, I knew it would be large and beautiful but in still seemed to take my breath away. Taking my time I walked into the building, I still had time to take a little look around after checking in and receiving my idea tag and a map of the building to go with the days schedule detailing where I should be for the majority of my summer. Walking up to the snack bar I waited behind an older guy as he ordered what was starting to sound like a very long list of different food, glancing back at me he had the biggest grin \"hey did you know that everything is free?\" \"I can help you miss,\" a woman's voice had me turning to another till \"ah ya thanks,\" I stated not sure if I was talking to the man or the woman, not that it mattered. After grabbing my mix fruit smoothie I started towards the room where all the interns would be gathering, sure enough everyone appeared to be mingling in clusters of small groups. Making my way through the groups I held on to the strap of my bag trying to keep it close to avoid damages. Not that, that had seemed to stop people from bumping into me. Lifting my gaze to the boy who had just backed in to me I was met with brown eyes, \"uh hello,\" he gave a small smile as his eyes dragged from my heels to my eyes, \"I don't believe we've met, I'm Graham Hawtrey, and you are?\" resisting the urge to roll my eyes I accepted his out stretched hand, \"Ava Barren.\" Graham gave a single nod before glancing back the way he came, \"can you believe those two old geezers are interns?\" Arching a single brow I looked around him to find the older guy that I had seen earlier that day standing beside another blonde older male, shrugging I glanced back over at Graham whose eyes were also no longer on the pair. \"well I'll see you around,\" he gave a cocky smirk before brushing past me, shaking my head I continued to find a seat which landed me a few seats over from a boy with thick black glasses whose eyes were glued to his phone. It wasn't long until an Indian man came in to start an introduction speech, \" I'm Mr. Chatty head of the intern program, welcome to Google!\" He went on to tell us that we would be doing what they did at work and of course would be supervised, he went on to explain that we'd be divided into teams and only one team would get the internship. Holding my breath I took a quick look around, there were a good 100 kids or so in here. \"Now you will be split up into several seminars to get you introduced to the program and our culture, emails with descriptions have been emailed to you. I'd wish you luck, but it's not luck that you need. Get to work!\" With that everyone was moving so of course I did what I always do, I froze holding up anyone that was behind me. \"Are you going to move, or wait for everyone to leave the room first?\" Glancing behind me I was met with glaring caramel eyes behind glasses and a scowling boy, \"uh ya, sorry.\" I nodded rushing to merge myself with everyone else, much to my displeasure, if he hadn't of been there I so would have waited for everyone to be out of my way first. It didn't take me long to find the next room, which I noticed a few familiar faces the older men, Graham and glaring glasses wearing guy. \"Hey Ava,\" Graham smiled at me as he walked through the door after the older men, I simply nodded in response as he sat behind me. \"You should definitely be in my group, I mean your credentials aren't anything to boost about, but I checked out a few of your web page designs not bad if I must say.\" \"Uh thanks? Listen not to be rude but I'm joining my friends for the whole group thing.\" I lied without looking at him in hopes he wouldn't see through it. \"Google is a work place,\" Mr. Chatty started the speech where we would raise a red paddle if it wasn't allowed to happen here or a green on if it was okay, as you can imagine everything seemed to be off limits, dating a fellow employee, getting drinks with your boss even taking home food from work. Sitting outside at one of the many bench tables, I pulled out my laptop and opened my email it turned out that there were dorm rooms for the interns at the back of the building and I'd be staying in room 23 which was a relief because I really didn't want to make this drive every day. Packing up my lap top I headed to my car where my suitcase was in the trunk, since I had planned on renting a motel I had prepared a nice amount of luggage. I had my wheelie suitcase and a carry on plus my laptops bag, so the trip to the dorm rooms were going to be long and aggravating. Locking up my car once again I turned and glared at the distance I'd have to walk, \"hey! wow where you going with all those bags?\" raising my eye brows I turned to see the older men from my intern class walking over \"to the dorm?\" I hadn't meant for it to come out as a question but it had, \"wait we have dorms?\" the taller one asked, I nodded. \"Well let us give you a hand with that, then we'll know where the dorms are.\" The blonde smiled trying to be friendly, I knew socializing with these two would make everyone here look at me like I was a big of freak as they all thought these two were, but on the upside that meant Graham would most likely leave me alone, and I didn't have to carry all these bags by myself. \"Alright,\" I nodded handing over the carryon bag to the taller man as the blonde reached for my suitcase, walking with them in silence by the time we had reached the Google building was driving me insane. \"I'm Ava, by the way.\" I stated glancing over my shoulder with a small smile, \"Oh I'm Billy, this here is Nick.\" the talker one answered seeming pleasantly surprised. \"So,\" I started falling back so I wasn't so far ahead as we walked, \"what made you guys decide to try out for the internship?\" \"uh well, you're never too old to try something new right?\" I smiled and shook my head, \"of course not, I mean you have to keep life interesting.\" \"So why'd you try out?\" Billy asked sending a small smile down my way, \"well I got into graphic design online at my collage so my mom thought it'd be a good idea to apply while the internship was going on.\" Billy and Nick nodded as we turned a corner at the back of the building, it was a long hallway filled with doors that had black numbers on them. We were at the far end of course, glancing to my right the door was 102 to my left was 101... I groaned \"everything ok?\" Billy asked with a raised eyebrow, \"yeah I'm at the other end.\" I pointed down the hall which was looking like it was endless at this point. \"That's fine, we don't mind.\" Nick stated as we continued to walk, 99...97...95...77...57...43...29... I perked up we were getting close. 23 I stopped and turned with a smile, \"this is it! So which rooms are yours?\" I asked glancing around the hall see only a few people coming and going, no one I recognized. \"uh, not sure, but we actually already rented out a motel so we won't be staying here.\" nodding I spun to use my id card which doubled as the key for my room's door, and opened it wide. Stepping inside the small space, the was a single bed in the middle of the wall on my right side, an end table beside it that had a small lamp and clock, on the opposite wall was a dresser that was bare. \"Well it's not home,\" I mused side stepping so the boys could take a look see on what they weren't missing out on. \"nah I'm sure you'll have it looking homier in no time,\" Nick stated as Billy nodded as they placed the bags beside my door. \"Hey uh, thanks for doing that,\" I nodded towards my bags \"it was really nice of yous.\" they only smiled back, \"anytime, we should get going though, Nick?\" Billy started for the door as Nick nodded fallowing behind him closing the door for me. Smiling I took another quick look, there was another door in my room I hadn't noticed walking over I opened it to find a very small bathroom but it would do. I didn't waste any time as I set out unpacking my clothes, my toiletries a few books I brought with me. I placed my laptop on my dresser then pulled out my phone, walking over I laid on my bed shifting through to see what texts that I had, turned out just to be my mom...of course. Mom: Hey hunnie, how is everything going? Make any new friends? Dad says hi, we love you and are very proud of you! XoXo Rolling my eyes I couldn't hide the smile that my mom's text brought me as I typed away my reply. Everything's good, still slow we'll be put in groups tomorrow. Not really, tell dad hi back, love you to. Tossing my phone onto the end table after I set my alarm I went to get out what I'd be wearing tomorrow, pulling out a green halter I pursed my lips and shook my head putting it back, next I pulled out a see through black spaghetti strap shirt that had white underneath with a champagne colored ribbon in the center, placing it on my dresser I moved on to pants and decided on a dark gray jeans, with black heels to go with it. After I showered I fell into a dreamless sleep without so much as blow drying my hair...something I'm sure I'd regret in the morning.[Chapter 2] Chapter two When you see my face Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell When you walk my way Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well Then he's a fool you're just as well Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell When I woke up and had obnoxiously curly hair I growled, I really didn't have time for this! After getting dressed in the outfit I had laid out the previous night I darted to the bathroom with my hair brush in hand, brushing my hair back I managed to get the top smoothed out but the rest was untamable as I pulled it up into a ponytail, it was a bit poufy with the curls but didn't look terrible. Sighing I did I rushed job on my eyeliner and lip gloss not having enough time to do much else I grabbed my laptop bag and was out the door sprinting...right in to someone. \"Oh! I am so sorry!\" I apologized as colour rose in my cheeks closing my door firmly behind me. \"oh uh, it's alright.\" a girl around my height stated looking shocked by my abrupt entrance, \"I guess you're going the same place as I am.\" I stated with a smile as I started walking and she quickly fallowed, \"yeah, I'm Neha.\" \"Oh Ava!\" I beamed. We walked most the way in silence not bothering to get to know each other since we were running out of time. \"Alright! Welcome you your second day googlers! Thus you are nooglers!\" I swear I could feel my whole face scrunched up, Nooglers really? \"Now this place is all about community and cooperation, so we're going to be in teams from here on out\" he was saying but was interrupted by Mr. Chatty \"awe he looks crushed!\" I stated quietly to Neha who had sat beside me. \"You have five minutes to split up into groups of six, go!\" Instantly everyone was off, Neha and I both stood and both froze, guess I wasn't the only one who didn't like a swarming mob. \"Does anyone want to be on a team with me? Super fun! And smart, but very fun!\" Neha's voice brought me back as her eyes met mine I smiled I gave a quick nod letting her know I'd stick with her after running her over this morning it was the least I could do. It didn't seem to matter though, because in no time at all it seemed everyone had a group...but us. Neha flopped down on the wooden seat with a heavy sigh, \"great, an amazing way to start the day, huh?\" she asked less then enthused glancing up at me. Shrugged I held on to the strap of my bag \"hey don't worry they're 102 interns so we'll have a group.\" \"yeah the last picked, we're the losers.\" she mumbled causing me to frown, \"we're not losers. we're uh...uh...okay I don't have anything right now, but I'll get back to you on that!\" Neha smiled shaking her head as I shifted on my feet hearing someone making load \"ka-bam! ka-flash! ka-zaw!\" sounds I turned with my eyebrows knitted over to the walk way, sure enough some guy around my age was talking very enthusiastically to Billy and Nick. \"Let's get a team meeting going everybody! Team meeting time!\" \"Oh god, does he mean?\" I trailed off looking at Neha as she scrambled to pick up her things \"yeah I think he means us.\" she confirmed as I let out a low groan, thinking that maybe I shouldn't have turned Graham down yesterday. Slowly as we fallowed so did a few others, Billy and Nick, an Asian guy I hadn't noticed before and sure enough so did the glasses guy. We all fallowed our team lead to another room, what looked like to be one of many computer rooms. \"Alright make yourselves comfy!\" he beamed at the six of us as we spread out, I leaned on a desk quietly watching as he clapped his hands nervously \"alright, let's get a meet and greet going on in this hizzy! I'm Lyle and its pretty much wizzy week, what you see is what you get. Been here at the gob for four years, working on seven progys at the memento.\" \"Wow seven progys?\" Nick asked straddling his stool, \"well they ask and I dos it, what can I say I'm a people pleaser, especially the ladies my Mercedes.\" He stated towards Neha as my eyebrows reached my hair line. \"It's all good in Lyle's hood ya heard?\" \"uh yea, is Lyle always going to be referring to himself in the third person? If he is I might want to punch Lyle is the face so,\" Glasses spoke up, \"ah to be fair, good note, Lyle's still a little nervous, first time manager, Lyle's a first time manager, I'm uh gunna stop doing that, gunna cut it out, keep it in the second person. SO who's next?\" He clapped his hands again as I shook my head and smiled. The Asian beside me stood up first, \"My name is Yo-yo Santos,\" \"Yo-yo how about a high five!\" Billy asked with a raised hand causing Yo-yo to instantly flinch away, \"ah easy, I come in peace!\" Billy joked taking back his hand, \"Yo-yo did you get beat up a lot in school?\" Nick asked, internally I groaned, no one wants to talk about that! \"I was home schooled by my mom,\" he stated \"did you get beat up a lot in home school?\" Billy asked \"Discipline is very important in growing up, my mother is actually a very nurturing person. For example she provided my milk from her buzzom\" and I tuned out about here, barely taking a notice in their debate about which was better breast milk or cows, instead I took that moment to check my phone. I had two new messages, one from my mother of course the other from my best friend Sadie. Mom: Morning hunnie! Hopefully you'll get in with a good group of kids and make lots of new friends! Don't forget to smile! XoXo Sadie: So how's it going?! I checked online for pictures and you haven't put any up! Get your ass on facebook now! Seriously if I don't hear from you soon I'm coming down there! ...no really I will. Smiling I shook my head at the two texts deciding I'd reply to them later, I glanced back up to see what was happening now. \"Oh ya, I'm Stuart.\" Glasses introduced himself after I can only assume he interrupted whatever conversation they were having, \"you know you can't believe whatever you read on the web,\" Nick stated realizing they were still talking about breast milk I glanced down at my phone typing a quick reply to Sadie. Its good, the people are well...strange. I'll get some up when there is something worth taking a picture of, and can't kinda in the middle of introductions with my group ATM I sent the text, \"Ok guys, I for one I'm glad to have two strapping mature gentlemen on the team.\" \"Thank you!\" Nick replied to Neha who apparently had broken something up I wasn't aware of, damn texting... \"I'm Neha Patel, oh and oh my god you two would make the best Luke and Hime.\" \"excuse me?\" Billy asked \"you know costume play, when people dress up as their favorite anime or movie character, I'd be slave girl Lia. Ya metal bikini top, metal g-string panties, high heel leather boots and of course I'm chained at the neck. Just enough to make things interesting.\" \"make things interesting?\" Billy asked \"yeah a few of us gets together and whatever happens, happens.\" Shocked I blinked a few times staring at the girl, who earlier I assumed was shy. Then my phone went off causing me to jump and quickly turn off the load music of 'Gives you hell' by the all American rejects chorus that blared from my cell, I wasn't the only one who jumped from the sudden noise. Glancing up all eyes were on me now, \"uh...sorry,\" blushing I directed it to Neha who shrugged in response \"I'm Ava Barren, and that was the all American rejects.\" I stated with a small smile seeing Stuart roll his eyes, my silence prompted Nick to tell us who he was, I didn't miss Stuart glancing back over at me with a board puzzled look as to why I hadn't gone on to tell everyone something useful about myself besides my name. That said everyone was introduced and finally our day could get productive! Sighing I opened the text from Sadie after I put my phone on vibrate, Sadie: Like bad strange or different strange? Take a picture of your team! I wanna know if you have any hott boys to flirt with! Glaring down at my phone I sent back a single worded reply. No. \"Alright team Lyle! No ok we'll work shop that, no tamata, okay doke our translate lecture is in fifteen minutes. Let's go!\" He beamed again with a clap of his hands, leaning on the table I watched as Neha then Nick and Billy, followed by Yo-yo and Stuart at the end before I fallowed behind. My phone buzzed in my hand as I glanced down about to open the text when Stuart caught my attention, \"is there a reason you waited for everyone else to go, again? Or do you really just like me?\" he was teasing, or at least I hoped he was, but his tone sounded so board it was hard to tell. \"I uh...it's nothing like that.\" I tried to assure him as my eyes widened in slight shock, \"right...\" I could basically hear his eye roll as he turned to face forward as we all continued walking. Mumbling under my breath something along the lines of immature stupid boys , I opened Sadie's text. Sadie: What do you mean no?! I need pictures Damnit! Don't make me come down there and take them myself! Groaning unintentionally out load I shook my head at my phone like she could actually see that, too bad for me Stuart had. \"Unless you're video chatting to your boyfriend, he won't get that message.\" I glanced up and glared \"Thanks for your concern.\" I stated rolling my eyes as he peered down at me through his glasses. \"What?\" I basically hissed which had his eyebrows raising if only a fraction, he shrugged \"nothing just taking in how incredibly awkward you are.\" \"what?\" this time I sounded shocked but he continued speaking as I matched my pace with his stepping alongside him, even though he didn't bother looking back at me again. \"Your obvious untamable red mess of hair, slightly skimpy clothing way over the top loud volume setting, choice of text ringtone...should I go on?\" Now his eyes glanced over my way, and I was sure my face was as red as my hair. When I fell back behind him without responding he only glanced back once more, but didn't say anything instead I noticed him turn and shrug. Apparently continuing to bother me wasn't worth the trouble. Something I was quietly grateful for. We all entered a room filled with those uncomfortable plastic chairs that I hadn't sat in since high school, we all fallowed Lyle back to about the fourth or fifth row then took our seats which meant sadly I was stuck beside Stuart the jerk. Opening up Sadie's text I responded quickly before the lecture started. God it feels like I'm in high school all over again...can't talk, text you later. Love you! Her reply of 'lol love you too!' Came instantly which had a small smile forming on my lips, \"Huh that makes sense,\" Stuart's sudden voice had me jumping in my seat bring our faces dangerously close when I turned and stared at him with my eyes wide and heart races, \"wh...what does?\" \"You're a lesbian.\" Shocked I blinked a few times as his words sunk in watching him pull back and lean in his chair, \"I am not,\" I stated quietly \"not that there would be anything wrong with it. Sadie is amazing...but no defiantly straight.\" His eyebrows raised as he watched me babbling half turned in my direction, \"so you are in to me than?\" he questioned with a slight smirk, oh he was so toying with me now I was sure. \"Listen very closely, I am not now, or every will be, in to you.\" I glared and he stilled smirked which resulting in my eye roll and him turning back to the front of the class as the lecture started.[Chapter 3] Chapter three (Authors note! Hey guys just wanted to send out a big thanks to my followers, khr216, XxCherryblossomxX33 and Sleepingbones who also pick this as a favorite! Yay! :) Anyway looking for some reviews to make sure my 30 readers so far like what I've got going on, I realize it's not a popular fan fiction topic which is greatly depressing! SO if you know of any good Internship Stuart/OC stories feel free to let me know! Yes okay I am in desperate need of some Stuart love! That is all.) / This morning I woke up to the sound of my phone beeping telling me I had an email, apparently we had our first competition today, and I had exactly 45 minutes to be in room 146 which was the computer room we all introduced ourselves in yesterday. Hurrying around my room I didn't have as much time as I'd like to get ready, so I decided on something simple and staid in my PJ shirt which happened to be a black tank top with the batman symbol on it, yes ok I did state I am a geek! I pulled on a pair of blue jeans and my black converse, pausing I debated on what I should do with my hair glancing over at the alarm clock I had 28 minutes left so I let it be down. \"Is...Is that batman?\" Yo-Yo asked when I arrived holding my fruit smoothie, \"what I'm not allowed to have a guilty pleasure?\" I brushed it off walking further in to our cubical area, \"funny I pictured you more of the 'Mary-Jane' type.\" Rolling my eyes I looked at Stuart unimpressed \"really? That's the best you've got?\" his response was to silently glare. \"Guys shhh it starting!\" Neha stated swatting at the air as all our attention was brought to the monitors that had Mr. Chatty on them with the title ' Debug the Code' floating above his head, internally I groaned. I mean I knew the basics, all the different codes that could be the problem but it wasn't something I enjoyed doing...most likely because it took up too much time, or it could just be that I sucked at it either or. As soon as he informed us of our job to find the bug, Neha, Yo-Yo and Stuart were all off to the see through board with dry erasers in hand. Sighing I pulled out a chair and my lap top, I'd like to tell you that I was standing at the board along with them writing down possible theories, but I can't. I mean I didn't just stand there and look pretty either, or surf facebook despite what Stuart might say! I was actually typing away making up a list of all the different types of bugs that way if it came down to it we could check for each one...which I secretly hoped would never happen. \"Codes...Code like a password right?\" Billy was ranting when Nick started to throw out ideas to add to the mix, glancing up I watched the two talking nonsense behind the others that were actually the most likely members to solve the problem. \"Guys! Guys!\" I yelled at the two as there rants of jipperish got louder and louder, but was ignored as Billy started to right on the board by Lyle. \"We're working!\" Nick yelled back at me before I stood up and snatched the marker out of Billy's hand, \"No, you're not! Not to be a bitch, but they are, you're just throwing around words that make no sense at all and will distract from any real progress!\" \"And that's a sharpie there, genius.\" Stuart added glancing over at Billy who I was currently standing beside, \"ah that's my fault.\" Billy moved around me, licking his hand to attempt wiping it off, scrunching up my face in mild disgust I was pulled back into a conversation by Nick. \"Hey kiddo we're just trying to help,\" \"look.\" Neha stated with a sigh turning around. \"I'm sorry, but you're not helping. You are saying a lot of words really fast, that mean nothing. To find the bug we need to scan the user logs review the code until we find the users mistake, it's the only way.\" \"Except maybe it's not the only way!\" Billy stated \"You said someone programmed it, which means someone in the building wrote that code.\" \"A human being!\" Nick added in. At this point I sighed and went back to sitting in my computer chair, \"let's give them a name and call him Tony, like say Tony like's kayaking all of a sudden-\" and I put my head phones on. I know it looked bad, but it worked. I was able to get what I needed done without distraction, until someone plopped down in the chair beside me. Glancing up to my right Stuart was opening programs up on the computer, pulling off my head phones I leaned back to see everyone doing the same thing...and the other two, I don't want to say idiots here so I'm going to call them 'enthusiastic gentleman' were missing. \"Uhh...what'd I miss?\" I asked loud enough for them to hear me, \"you really weren't paying any attention were you?\" Neha asked sounding assumed from my left \"of course not, she's all looks no brain.\" Stuart stated making me scowl at him and debate hitting him upside the head. \"They uh, went looking for the guy who made the code.\" Yo-Yo stated after a brief silence, sitting at the computer directly behind me. \"You're kidding!\" I'm not sure if it came off as amusement or disbelief but I was definitely caught in the middle, \"No he's not, and it isn't funny.\" Lyle cut in from Yo-Yo's right, I frowned, \"no...\" biting my lip I wanted to tell him it was hilarious but held it in. \"But, it does give us time to work.\" I finally stated. Stuart scoffed catching my attention \"Us? You've been playing around this whole time in your own little world, you're as useful as those other two-\" \"Enthusiastic gentlemen?\" I cut in before he could say something particularly nasty, \"if that's what you call it.\" he mumbled typing away. I shrugged it off and went back to work, yeah it sucked that he thought so lowly of me but I'd prove him wrong sooner or later whenever the ball landed in my court, so to speak. Ten minutes later they were bickering again, \"Almost done checking to see if the subscription had the wrong certificate.\" \"Almost? Its either you're done or you're not, you can't be almost pregnant.\" Neha stated clearly frustrated \"Hey yeah she'd know guys.\" Stuart taunted, honestly I was just glad to see him pestering someone other than me. \"Why don't you Google asshole? Asshole.\" \"She's right guys get it together.\" Yo-Yo stated from behind me, \"What the hell was that?\" Neha asked clearly seeing something I hadn't. \"I was punishing myself for my inferior performance.\" \"Oh ya that's great, that one's crazy. Somewhere there's a geek orgy that you're late for.\" Straightening I glanced between Stuart and Neha there was no way he said that to me, right? \"Yeah well somewhere they're a micro folios convention that you're late for.\" Neha retorted as I shrunk down in my chair, \"Did your mind just instantly go to a penis joke?\" Sighing I pushed out of my chair leaving my laptop and started to walk away as they continued to bicker, \"Ava! Hey uh Ava where you going?\" Lyle caught me about to exit. Sighing I put on a fake smile, \"bathroom break, I'll be back!\" I could tell he didn't buy it, but said nothing about it. I really did go to the bathroom though if only to splash water on my face and escape my infuriating team. By the time I came back everyone was packing up, even my laptop was put away. \"Uh guess it's over?\" I looked to Lyle who looked upset but nodded \"yeah we lost, we're all going to eat lunch together if you wanted to join.\" \"Sure,\" I shrugged \"Don't really have anywhere else to be.\" Grabbing for my bag I followed everyone out to the court yard. After grabbing our trays and finding an empty table Lyle, Yo-Yo and Neha sat on one side, leaving Stuart and I on the other. Both of us pressed ourselves to the edges not wanting anything to do with the other, which if anyone else noticed they probably thought it looked peculiar. The boys were in their own conversation when Neha struck one up with me, \"so, you're a batman fan?\" she asked pointing my shirt out with a smile, shrugging \"I guess, really I'm more into wolverine.\" I felt more then heard the table go silent, after glancing around sure enough they were all looking at me like I grew a second head, \"it's not that strange!\" I defended myself as a blush started to rise up in my cheeks, \"for someone who shows up looking how you did yesterday and then to look like that, yes, yes it is strange.\" Stuart stated tapping away at his phone, \"so what I can't look nice and read a good comic once in a while?\" \"No.\" furrowing my eyebrows I scowled at him, \"and why not?\" \"because it makes you look like a poser.\" I swear my jaw dropped, recovering I glared at him not that he'd spare me a glance to know it. \"Heyy! You guys find professor Xavier?\" Stuart asked as Nick and Billy walked up. \"Yeah we found him,\" Nick stated sounding unimpressed with their joke, cocking my eyebrow at Neha who bite her lip in response confirmed that they had sent these two out to look for the leader of the x man. \"Thanks so much for that, it's really great team spirit.\" Billy added in, I wanted to shrink in my seat, even if I hadn't been involved \"wanna slide over?\" Stuart spread his lags as far as he probably could without looking too outrageous \"I'm sorry, it really doesn't look like there is enough room for you.\" Yo-Yo piped up glancing from his food to the men. \"Have a great lunch,\" Nick stated \"yeah enjoy it.\" Billy added before they walked off making my stomach sink. \"was that necessary?\" I whispered harshly looking from Stuart to Yo-Yo, Yo-Yo stared at his food without answering me while Stuart shrugged. \"They're wasting our time, so let them eat by themselves.\" I raised my eyebrows glancing over at Lyle who shrunk back in his seat, then to Neha who looked caught between a rock and a hard place. \"Oh you've got to be kidding me!\" I snapped making them jump, glaring at Stuart more than anyone I stated very sternly \"grow the hell up.\" before storming off, I paused by the table that Billy and Nick were at \"sorry about that,\" I started quietly before the noticed I was there. \"oh hey Ava,\" Nick smiled at me \"no worries, it's not your fault.\" Billy stated as I gave a single nod, \"I'm heading out, but...if you need anything,\" I trailed off as they nodded and smiled. Turning I basically stumbled into Graham's chest, \"hey sweet thing,\" he smirked down at me as I rolled my eyes, \"so these are your friends?\" he glanced at them with a look of distaste, \"Yes, do you have a problem with that?\" I attempted to look intimidating by straightening my spine and working up my best glare, he only smiled at me. \"Nope, I was just coming to let you know we've won the first challenge.\" Internally I groaned, \"I was just wondering what you were going to do?\" the question was directed at Billy and Nick, much to my relief. \"It doesn't matter what were going to do, or not going to do. We'll be just fine.\" Billy assured him, \"ah keep telling yourself that then.\" Graham nodded with a smile before turning his eyes on me again, \"Ava I'll be seeing you around.\" Gritting my teeth I watched as he walked away, \"god I hate that guy!\" I stated throwing my hands in the air catching Nick and Billy to laugh. That night I went for a jog alone around the grounds, which was fine and long over do! Showered laid out my outfit for tomorrow, blow dried my hair did everything else that was a part of my nightly routine and climbed into bed. Tomorrow our competition was in sports, something I was good at ' muggle quittage' I couldn't wait. /REVIEW! REVIEW! REVIEW! :D plzzzzzzzzzz[Chapter 4] Alright so I wasn't actually going to post this until the movie was released on DVD but in celebration of this stories first review I changed my mind! So a quick shout out to BrittWitt16 for her review :) Anyway here we go! Reviews are appreciated and equal quicker updates! Chapter four \"Alright everyone gather round!\" Lyle waved everyone in to a circle, I found myself beside Nick and Stuart. Why was it always him? I mean I get that we're on a team together, so I'm doomed to see him every day for the rest of this summer and next summer if we win the internship, which is when it really begins but seriously I was always finding myself next to him. I knew I had to make nice, I had to push aside any and all feelings of whatever kind and find a way to work with this group. If I wanted this internship, which I'm honestly not sure I cared, I mean I was only here because my mom seen the add. If I was being honest, I'd probably end up designed the graphics for video games or even my own comic books. \"Ok rules,\" Lyle continued to say after we all formed the circle, the rules were of course harry potter related which had an unhidden smile forming on my lips as I watched Nick and Billy looked confused even Stuart looked got between shock an amusement. \"No imperious curses, no fungus charms.\" Raising my hand to my lips I tried to physically withhold the laugh that was forming. \"Lyle, Lyle, Lyle.\" Neha finally interrupted him as an unpermitted giggle left my mouth, \"these beautiful idiots, have no idea what you're talking about. Use your muggle words, come on.\" I'm fairly sure I was beaming at Neha, full on smile, ok so today would be a good day. We would win this, I would befriend this team prove to Stuart I'm not some useless girl without a brain and that I am not, I repeat not a poser. Yeah, today, today would be a new day a good day. \"Come on man, you're making me feel like I'm back in math class. You have a couple savants here with hand eye coordination, just say game on and let us play.\" Nick stated \"Fair enough,\" Lyle nodded \"version 2.0 peg them with the kick balls before they throw the volley ball's through the hoop. Broom's in people, Hufflepuff on three, one, two three! Hufflepuff!\" Lyle started shouting excitedly as I pouting turning to Stuart who raised an eyebrow at me, \"I didn't want to be a hufflepuff.\" I stated trying to hold back the smile that pulled at my lips, \"not surprising,\" Stuart stated before a small smirk formed on his lips \"you're more of a slytherin.\" Getting in to his personal space I jabbed my finger into his chest, \"You know what, that was just mean.\" I glared before continuing \"But I'm going to forgive that you said that because we're going to win this game.\" I barely stuck around long enough to see his eye roll before wandering off after the rest of our team to line up. Crouching down like I did for track back in high school we waited as the coach Sid I had learned his name earlier today made sure both teams were ready, after he called the go ahead and everyone was running to the center of the field to grab the 'volleyballs' to throw through the hoops, it seemed like no time at all before Graham's team scored the first goal. Which the guy himself spared no time to point out, \"Hey look at that Ava, first goal. Regretting not joining my team when you could've?\" He snickered as I rolled my eyes \"gloat while you can, I'll be the one gloating when this summer ends and my team has the internship.\" I stated trying my best to sound sweet as I faked a smile. Than his team scored again, \"Ava! Stop talking to the enemy and play!\" Nick yelled over bringing my mind back to the game as I ran off to the other side of the field, as far from Graham as I could get. Which resulted in me catching a ball and tossing it to Neha, who attempted a toss to Stuart hitting him square in the side of the face. \"What was that?\" He called over glaring at her as I stood open mouthed not believing what just happened, the first team our team gets the ball, I'm the one who gets it, passes it and then our team losses it. Great. \"Why don't you try looking up and actually giving a shit, man!\" Neha snapped back looking irritated I didn't catch Stuart's response as a commotion started on the field, sure enough our team was the cause. Billy was waving around his broom like a weapon trying to hit any balls that came close enough. \"Billy what the hell! Stop that!\" I called out seconds before the whistle blew, the ref telling him to knock it off. \"My bad, lesson learned!\" Billy repeated a few times as I sighed shaking my head. I started running when I noticed Graham had the ball and was running to make the shot, Nick was attempted a block but missed as the ball flew through the hoop. Jugging backwards Graham stopped when he was about to pass me, \"So seriously sweet cheeks, let me know when you're ready to admit defeat and join team Graham. The winning team, might I add.\" Rolling my eyes I watched unmoving as Graham took off and high fived a few of his cheerleaders. Maybe he was right, maybe my team was full of losers maybe it had been over for us before it even started even Neha called us losers when we failed to secure a team of our own. We were the leftovers, the rejects, losers, and I was on this team all because I caught some guy staring at my rack and didn't want to be on a team with that same said guy? Oh the irony that he was now kicking my teams ass. His team continued to score, we got the ball occasionally I even scored once, and I was the only one. It was half time before long, Graham's team 7, my team 1. \"Come on let's huddle up!\" Lyle called as we all slowly, and I mean awe-inspiringly slow, walked to huddle up. \"It's over,\" Neha stated as Yoyo and I finally made it to the rest of them. \"Yeah, our teams a joke.\" I wanted to point out that he was wrong, Billy and Nick were trying, Neha had caught and passed a few balls, I had scored. But even still with all that positive thoughts I couldn't make my mouth move to disagree with him. \"Well I ain't laughing, how about you Billy?\" Nick spoke up as I glanced up across our circle to look at him, \"Hell no.\" Billy answered to his left, \"Listen we need to get our minds right Ava nice shot out there by the way, all we need to do is start believing!\" Nick continued before Billy started to tell us a story about a girl with a dream who spun her way in to people's hearts. Yes, Billy was talking about 'flash dance' the movie from the eighties. Which led to a random topic about being called a maniac, \"my mom calls me a maniac every night when I tell her I love her.\" Yoyo stated from my right, as I raised my eyebrow looking over at him. Honestly the more I heard about his home life the more weirded out and slightly concerned I became, \"of course she does Yoyo! You are a little bit, in a good way.\" Nick encouraged, and somehow their story about the little welder girl had inspired everyone. And that is what changed everything for us in our second half, I actually really believed we were going to win as we caught, passed and scored goal after goal. Graham had noticed, which meant he hadn't bothered me with any taunts for the rest of the game so that was always a plus. Now it was time for the golden snitch, the part in every quidditch game in the harry potter series that had you on the edge of your seat while you waited for the winning team to catch it. This was it, everyone was running Nick, Billy and Graham in the lead. Nick went down, then Billy was down. Graham had the snitch and the fans erupted with screaming cheers as everyone ran out onto the field. \"Nick you ok?\" I asked running over glancing towards where Billy was still down for the count, \"yeah, yeah I'm fine.\" He slowly stood and made his way towards Billy, who was also getting up now. \"Well that's it,\" Neha stated coming up from behind me, \"we lost.\" she stated with a sigh, as if that wasn't already obvious \"yeah well they cheated!\" I growled out crossing my arms as the others approached, Lyle on my other side, Stuart next to him and Yoyo on his other side. \"He cheated!\" Yoyo yelled when Billy and Nick limped back over to us, \"now, now don't start that.\" Billy attempted to stop everyone from wallowing, but I was fairly sure it was too late for that. \"You did you're best out there, you all did. That's the first time we've all come together as a team,\" Billy stated looking at each of us. \"And Damnit, I'm really proud.\" \"Yeah,\" Nick chimed in placing his hand on first Yoyo's shoulder, than Stuarts \"let's keep in going, keep in rolling,\" Lyle's, Neha's \"come on.\" and finally mine. Before the grossest thing happened, \"Nick,\" Billy called getting his attention as his hand fell from my shoulder. \"Would it be wrong to call you my brother?\" \"No, ask me anything,\" Nick replied \"I need you to ice my balls for me.\" Billy stated causing all of us to turn and walk away silently. Nobody needed to hear that. /A little later \"So he was right,\" Neha stated as we walked to our dorms, \"umm you're going to have to give me more than that.\" I stated with a laugh, \"Billy, he was right that was the first time we came together as a team. It's just we need to do that if we want a chance at winning.\" I nodded as we walked down the hall coming to a stop at my door. \"Alright, well if I don't see you again tonight. Goodnight, and I'll see you tomorrow.\" Neha stated with a smile before I hugged her briefly, then said goodbye and ducked into my room. After showering I pulled on a lime green tank top that had a teddy bear on the front with cursive words saying 'bear hugs' underneath it, blue jean shorts and baby blue converse. Pulling my hair back I piled the red mess into a bun on the top of my head and set out to go find something for dinner. After grabbing up a tray I debated sitting alone out on the grass, but as I walked through the half emptied food court I spotted a familiar beanie wearing head. Biting my lip I paused, I could keep walking he hadn't seen me since his back was to me, but he was alone, which meant he was alone! No group to act as a buffer, which would probably mean him taunting me or worse we'd be sitting in awkward silence until one of us left. Taking a deep breath, it's for the team, I reminded myself as I walked around to the other side of the table he was sitting at. He hadn't even looked up once as he continued to stare at his phone with a half eaten sandwich sitting on his tray alone with an apple and his pop. \"Mind if I sit?\" I asked after a moment, waiting to see if he'd notice, watching him jump in surprise and press his phone into his lap with slightly widen eyes I almost said 'on second thought I think I'll go and leave you to your phone, and whatever you were doing.' He must have read the thought clear on my face as his own started to splotch, \"uh no, go ahead.\" Taking the seat as I feared an awkward silence settled in, he was sitting across from me clearly uncomfortable as he shifted back and forth looking around the food court. Probably taking in all the appealing empty seats that were scattered about. \"Are the others not joining you?\" Stuart finally asked breaking the silence as his eyes landed on me for the first time since I sat down, \"uh no.\" I stated wanting to ask if this was too weird but firmed my lips as he nodded and seemed to settle down slightly. \"You were good out there today,\" Stuart stated moments later as I picked at my fries, \"thanks,\" I smiled up at him \"you're weren't half bad either, caught a few amazing saves.\" I stated before ducking my head back down feeling a slight blush creep its way on to my face. Okay, this was stupid I was not one of those girls who flirted and formed a crush on some guy how showed no interest and actually to come to think of it he showed the opposite. \"What do you think will be our next assignment?\" I asked forcing myself to act casual, Stuart Twombly was just another guy and everyday ordinary extremely smart guy who apparently had some hidden athletic ability. \"I don't know,\" he stated with a shrug sounding bored, \"we'll find out tomorrow I guess.\" Nodding I continued to pick at my fries until a hand invaded my vision and my fries, causing me to freeze. \"What are you doing?\" I asked looking up with a raised eyebrow, watching Stuart who was leaning across the table and stealing a few of my fries. He smirked back at me before sitting back down popping the fries he had stolen into his mouth, silently I still watched him probably in shock, with my eyebrows raised. \"They looked good, so...\" he trailed off with a shrug glancing around like he was looking for someone. \"Yeah, they are good.\" I stated with a nod \"and they're mine.\" I stuck my tongue out at him pulling my tray slightly closer like a child as he watched me amusement growing on his face, before he rolled his eyes. \"Whatever you say weirdo.\" Pouting I pointed my fork at him, \"stop calling me that.\" \"Why? You're weird.\" he responded dropping his elbow onto the table and leaning in to his open palm as he watched me with a bored expression, \"am not!\" I argued back, \"are too.\" he teased \"Am not!\" I snapped a little louder causing him to smirk. \"How old are you again? Because you're acting like a five year old.\" He stated as I bit back my response, which of course was a childish one and a classic, 'you started it!' instead I laughed, which caught him off guard as he straightened slightly. \"You know what,\" I started to say catching his full attention \"go ahead call me whatever you want.\" I shrugged before finishing off the last of my fries, \"seriously?\" he asked mouth slightly open in response I shrugged again \"yeah I mean I've been called worse.\" \"Like?\" He questioned as I looked at him with an arched eyebrow, with a plastered you-really-expect-me-to-tell-you? Look. \"Right, you're not going to tell me are you?\" He chuckled leaning back in his seat, with a pondering look as a popped the word \"Nope\" \"Well what should I call you?\" He mused out loud \"how about my name?\" I japed playfully as he rolled his eyes, seemingly completely at ease for once, \"everyone calls you by your name.\" \"Well yeah, it's a sure way to get my attention.\" I stated with a humored laugh, \"Weirdo get's your attention.\" he stated as I cringed. \"Well why don't you take the night and sleep on it?\" I suggested trying to lead him to believe I didn't care. Which I totally did. \"Yeah, I should get going anyway.\" Stuart stated as he started to get up, nodding I did the same walking to throw out my garbage. \"Are you headed back to the dorms?\" I asked as we both stood by the doors to head back inside, \"uh is that where you're heading?\" He asked as I nodded, \"I've actually got to check something out first, but I'll see you tomorrow.\" With a small smile I nodded but didn't have the nerve to hug him like I had with Neha, for obvious reasons, \"well, goodnight.\" I stated before turning, barely hearing him say night before I was out of ear shot. /Stuart's prow When Ava told me to sleep on it, I somehow seriously doubt she had meant it so latterly and yet thoughts of her was exactly why I was tossing and turning in my bed finding it hard to fall asleep. I was here with a purpose, I had to prove to my dad that I wasn't wasting all my time on my phone or the computer but that I was actually good enough to do something with my life that revolved around technology. That was why I was here, not to get attached to some girl how was all over the place. My very first impression of her was that she was shy, and was even good looking but was obviously lost because girls who were smart didn't look like she did. At least not at my school. Then she had been put in my group, I hadn't given her a second thought until that happened knowing I'd be spending nearly every day with her for the rest of the summer it was like torture. It was bad enough I had two old idiots on my team, a sex crazed girl, and a dude that was straight up crazy but I had to have the let's be honest, hot girl who was proving to be just as useless as the other idiots there to distract me too? That was probably why I had started to pick on her pointing out her untamable red mess of hair, slightly skimpy clothing way over the top loud volume setting, choice of text ringtone. Anything I knew at the time that would bring her down a peg, just to make her seem a little more normal and not so modal like. It probably helped that she had shown up with less than perfect hair that day. I had even briefly hoped she was a lesbian, that way it would remove any distraction she may have had of course that didn't happen. Then she showed up wearing a batman tank top, seriously what was she trying to do? Distract every nerdy guy here or was she just out to make things harder, pun not intended but recognized, for me? I mean seriously she hadn't helped, like at all with our first assignment and that left for a \"bathroom break\" yeah right, just before we found out we had lost. Of course I took advantage of that and started to snoop on her computer to find out just what she had spent her time doing, and was surprised that she was brushing up on her coding like actually studying and doing vaguely related work. Neha had bitched that I shouldn't have been on her computer, so I lied and said I was shutting it down to pack it up and I did since I was caught. But then at lunch she made it worse, she had comic book knowledge, apparently she liked wolverine over batman and doesn't find anything wrong with all the mixed up signals she was putting out, so obviously I called her a poser bringing her down another peg making her look even more normal. Of course it hadn't worked, because my mind kept playing over the image of her in skimpy clothing wild curly red hair curled up in her bed reading comic books. Yeah that just made her seem like she was from another planet, not simply an attractive completely out of my league girl, but a rare one of a kind find that I kept taking swings at in hopes she'd be normal. Fortunately Billy and Nick showed up, unfortunately after we sent them away Ava blew up on me. Yes I mean me, not Lyle, Neha or Yoyo even if she did scowl at them she was yelling at me. I swear that the moment her face twisted into anger and disbelief I stopped breathing, and didn't start again until she walked off, well stormed off. I had watched Graham talking with her, Billy and Nick. It made sense, I tried to tell myself that they were probably involved I had seen him talk to her before, so that was a reason to brush her off. Than at the game earlier tonight when she pouted at me it was so strange, a good strange but still left an unwanted feeling behind. But then when I was watching her in the game, yes ok I was paying more attention to what she was doing then the game itself, she was talking to him again and then I heard Nick call her out on talking to the enemy it brought back the idea that they were involved somehow. And then the strangest thing happened, she sat with me for dinner just hours ago nearly catching me goggling her. Not my finest moment. For once we were alone, that in its self was dangerous and I was completely unprepared for. But I hadn't expected to find myself relaxing with her, like she was just a normal girl one that was actually paying me attention and not the 'let's be partners in this project where you do all the work' kind of attention. It was completely unbeneficial for her, she wasn't gaining anything by sitting there letting me steel her fries which I still couldn't believe I had actually done, or that she stuck her tongue out at me, which lead to the teasing of how weird she was. It just seemed to spiral out of control! And then she laughed, not at me but in actually amusement at least that's what it looked and sounded like. Which brings me back to why I was laying in bed half asleep still trapped in my thoughts about the red headed girl who had caught my attention from the very moment she sat down a little ways away from me on our first day. I was supposed to sleep on what I was going to call her from here on out, I could give up and call her by her name like she had pointed out 'Ava' but hearing her name made me uncomfortable it was so much easier to call her Weirdo and awkward or that other girl on our team, but none of those names felt like enough to keep calling her for the rest of the summer. That's when the thought hit me as I thought about her beaming smile at the quidditch game when she was listening to Lyle go on and on about all the rules in harry potter terms, her gray eyes, her pout when she told me she didn't want to be a hufflepuff, and her brilliant red hair. Red. I would start calling her Red. It didn't sound like I was picking on her, it wasn't something that made me fidget or make a sarcastic remark at her expense whenever I heard it. It was only a color, yes it happened to be the color of her hair but still it was neutral, normal. Something I was starting to see her as, normal. Normal and beautiful and athletic and nice and a comic book reading girl. Red. She was my Red. Well not MY Red... ","Summary":" Chapter one Checking myself over in the flip down mirror of my blue Honda Civic for the final time "},{"Movie":"Funny Games U.S.","Title":"Let's Play A Game","Author":"Joncal","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6066670","Passage":"[Chapter 1] KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Just stay in bed, Sarah commanded herself. She rubbed her eyes tiredly, and let out a yawn. Glancing at the clock, she discovered it was a quarter past eight. The seventeen year-old let out an angry groan and jerked the covers over her head. The knocking persisted, this time louder. Just ignore it, Sarah told herself, trying her best to drift back off to sleep. KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! \"Somebody get the door,\" Michael, her little brother, called out groggily from his room down the hall. KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! \"Sarah, please get that!\" \"Fuck you, Michael! Get it yourself. I'm sick.\" KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! \"Just get it, Sarah.\" \"Alright, fine!\" The teen slumped to her feet. She then quickly ran a brush through her messy black hair before struggling into the fuzzy pink bathrobe her mother had purchased for her almost a year ago. Sarah made her way out into the hallway, and promptly slipped on her brother's baseball glove. \"Oh!\" She lost her footing and tumbled to the carpet. Her elbow exploded in fresh pain. \"You need to pick your shit up!\" With a frustrated grunt she heaved the leather glove at Michael's door. It connected solidly with a low 'thunk'. \"Little asshole,\" she muttered under her breath. Downstairs, the knocking grew louder. \"I'm coming!\" she cried. Standing at the door, much to her surprise, was a handsome and well-bred young man. Wow. He's cute. \"Sorry to bother you so early,\" he began. He was soft-spoken. \"Um, my name is Peter, and I live across the lake. Mrs. Culver sent me. She ran out of eggs. Would you happen to have some that she could borrow?\" He wore black Vans, with matching black golf shorts, and white short-sleeved Polo shirt with white golf gloves. His dirty blond hair was long and untidy. His face was round, boyish, and cute. But his most striking feature was his eyes: dark and intense. \"Um, yeah. I think. How many does she need?\" \"Three.\" \"Okay, hold on a sec.\" \"Thank you very much,\" Peter murmured shyly. Sarah disappeared into her family's cramped kitchen, and opened the fridge. Mom really needs to go shopping, she thought, her eyes scanning the near-empty shelves. A tub of butter. A gallon of milk. Some cans of Coke. But that was it. No eggs. \"Are you out of eggs?\" Peter asked loudly. He now lingered in the kitchen doorway. \"Yeah. My mom hasn't gone shopping yet. Tell Mrs. Culver I'm sorry, okay?\" Peter looked puzzled. \"Are you sure?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"I asked if you -\" \"Yeah. I'm sure. Now can you please go?\" \"Oh,\" Peter said, blushing furiously. \"That . . . that was very rude of me. I should have taken your word. I'm sorry I had to bother you so early .\" \"It's okay. It was nice meeting you We should hang out sometime, if you want.\" Peter grinned. \"Okay. I would enjoy that.\" \"Um, shouldn't you be getting back to Mrs. Culver now?\" Peter blushed furiously. Why are you being so hard on him? He's gonna think you're a bitch. Cool it. \"Yeah, I suppose. Sorry.\" \"It's okay. I'm just a little tired.\" Peter nodded. \"I understand.\" \"Tubby, did you get the eggs?\" Sarah froze. Another one? But . . . . . wasn't Peter alone when I answered the door? Peter cocked his head in the direction of the second voice. \"No. She said she was out.\" The voice belonged to a handsome, tall young man, who looked about a year older than Peter. \"I'm Paul,\" the cute boy said, introducing himself.[Chapter 2] Bang! Michael slowly opened his eyes. His head throbbed with a dull but persistent pain. He shivered and tugged the blanket up to his chin. Michael had spent half a car ride and three vacation days stricken with the flu. He had fallen into a deep and sluggish sleep the other night, around the same time his sister Sarah began running a fever. Like most eleven year-old boys, he would rather much be outside playing baseball or cooling off in the lake, but for now he was confined to his bedroom. At least until he was over the sickness. He hacked dryly. For a moment he thought about calling out for his sister to bring him a glass of water, but decided not to get on her bad side. Plus, she would probalby still be asleep. Michael glanced at the clock. Nine-thirty. Yep. Sarah wouldn't be up for another two hours or so. Shit. Oh well. I'll just get it myself. Michael found himself wondering what that 'bang' had been. He slipped into a fresh sweater, still battling a terrible fever, and shuffled into the hallway. That's when he heard two distinct and unfamiliar voices from downstairs. He thought about calling for his sister, but stopped himself. What if someone's robbing us? What if they have guns? Holy fucking shit. What am I gonna do? Crouching low, he peeked from behind the wooden railing of the stairs, and caught a brief glimpse of two young men in preppy sportswear. \"Oh my God,\" Michael whispered to himself. He began to tremble when he heard his sister blubbering from downstairs, and nearly cried out when he saw her propped up in their father's recliner, arms and legs bound with Duct tape. Sarah! Run! Get help! Michael returned to his room, tears welling up in his eyes. What was he going to do? He glanced at his window. I . . . I could climb out and get in the boat. And . . . and then I could go find Uncle Jim. He'll have a phone, and we can call the cops. Yeah. It'll work. He slowly tiptoed over to the window, fearing the floorboards would creak and alert the intruders. His plan was easier said then done, as he soon re-discovered his long-forgotten fear of heights. It was only a thirteen foot drop, but to Michael it seemed like a hundred. His mind flashed back to the intruders, and his sister's tear-streaked face. Grow some balls, he told himself, heart thudding in his chest. Wait. What good are you if you break your ankle trying to jump out the window? Seriously, are you that stupid? Just tie a bed-sheet around your waist, and tie the other end to a bed post. It works all the time. Easy. Now he just had to scale his way down the side of the house. That shouldn't be too hard. Right? His entire body trembled as he crawled out the window. He gripped the windowsil, hanging on with all his strength, not wanting to let go. He feared the sheet would tear and he would then plumet to the earth and break his neck. Michael gulped. Grow some balls. He slowly began to lower himself. Questions raced through his mind. Who were the intruders that had broken into his home? What did they want? What had they done to his sister? And what were they going to do to him if they caught him? He shivered at the thought. Suddenly from inside his room: a familiar and dreaded rip. Michael's sheet tore and he fell seven feet, landing on his back. \"Oof!\" His body exploded in fresh pain, and his teeth rattled inside his skull. He rolled onto his stomach, and struggled to his feet, his mind spinning wildly. Got to get help. He broke into a run and headed for the dock. And he probably would have made it if Paul hadn't seen him through the window. \"Hey!\" Michael froze, cocked his head to the side, and discovered a young man jogging towards him. He recognized the man's clothes. He was one of the intruders. RUN DIPSHIT. RUN. \"Don't go Mikey. We're gonna let you and your sister play this really fun game!\" Michael lost his footing, and crashed to the ground in a heap. He was caught.[Chapter 3] It was only one in the afternoon, but the temperature was already approaching ninety-three. Paul had been fidgeting uncomfortably for quite some time, and Sarah could see small beads of perspiration gleaming on his handsome face. He scratched his expensive looking haircut, glanced at Peter, and asked him, rather politely one might add, if he would mind opening a window. Peter nodded obediently, and rose to his feet. He approached Sarah, whom the boys had tied up hours ago, and inquired: \"Um, excuse me, but would you mind if I were to open a window? It's pretty hot in here.\" \"Go fuck yourself,\" Sarah spat, her voice strained. At that moment Paul's gloved hand lashed out and connected solidly with her cheek, which was followed by a loud and almost comical SMACK. \"There's no need for that kind of language,\" Paul said disapprovingly. \"Do you want us to put the tape back on? Do you want us to hurt your brother again?\" Blinking away tears, Sarah glanced down at Michael, who lay on his side, bound and gagged with a piece of cloth. He looked back up at her, eyes wide, fearful yet expressionless at the same time. He whimpered softly from behind the ratty wash-rag. \"No . . . I'm . . . I'm sorry,\" she apologized, a lump forming in her throat. \"Apology accepted,\" Paul replied, smiling gaily. \"Um, so do you think it would be okay if I opened a window?\" Peter repeated. He wiped his forehead. \"Yes, you may.\" Michael made a pitiful grunting noise. He was crying. \"Hey, cheer up, buddy,\" Paul said soothingly. \"I know something that'll make you feel better. You wanna play a game?\" Sniffling, followed by silence. Peter had returned. \"Oh, we're going to play the game?\" he questioned. He walked over to the sofa, grabbed the boy by his shoulders, and hoisted him to his feet. Michael made little effort to get away, but it wasn't like he would be able to anyways. Peter plopped down on the loveseat, balancing Michael on his knee, as if he were a little brat about to deliver his Christmas list to the department store pillow-bellied Santa Claus. \"Hey, quit crying,\" Peter ordered, speaking in a stern yet gentle voice. \"You're gonna play the Game.\" \"What's the game?\" Peter smiled. Paul produced a crinkled, wadded-up Bi-Lo bag and covered the boy's head with it. \"You'll like this game. It's called 'Cat in the Bag'.\" Michael shrieked hoarsely. He struggled, trying his best to escape and end the Game, but Peter held him firmly. It was no use. \"Stop it!\" his sister cried, tears beginning to stream down her cheeks. \"Stop!\" If only she could move. If only she could fucking move . She thrust herself off the couch in a crazy, sideways motion. Her forehead exploded in a burst of pain. Her vision blurred. Stars danced wildly before her eyes. She felt weightless, and she was growing extremely lightheaded. The pain was still fresh and furious, and Sarah wasn't sure just what the hell happened. She suspected Paul had struck her again, but as she hit the carpet, she saw the coffee table and realized her mistake. She had bumped her head on it. Something warm and sticky was flowing from the spot where her forehead and the edge of the coffee table had shook hands. Shit … why did I move the goddamn coffee table? Mom's always telling me not … Her thoughts drifted off, and she found her self drifting off into a thick darkness. Sarah slowly gained consciousness and was met with a dull, throbbing pain. Disoriented, her mind hazy, she glanced around and wondered why she was in the living room instead of her bed. Her eyes fell on a small puddle of maroon, and everything came back to her. She whimpered. Michael … oh God … Craning her neck up, she saw not a soul. \"Michael?\" Silence … Then, whistling. From the hallway. It was Paul. The tune sounded familiar. Very familiar! She couldn't quite place it. It was a slow melody, haunting yet catchy. \"Breaking The Girl\"? No fucking way. Her stomach felt knotted and coiled. Her heart thundered in her chest. The two well-dressed young men stepped into the living room. Michael was not with them. \"Where's Michael?\" \"Ah, you're awake. Here, I'll help you up.\" \"Where the fuck is Michael? What the fuck did you do to him?\" Paul buried his sneaker in Sarah's ribs. There was sharp, fierce explosion of pain that raced all the way from her armpit down to her hip. She cried out. She began to weep. \"Now, I told you,\" Paul said, grabbing the duct tape off the table, \"there's no need for that kind of language. We're gonna have to punish you now!\" He tore a piece of tape off the roll and sealed her mouth shut. \"We really don't like doing this, but you keep forcing us to,\" Peter said, bending down to his knees. \"It hurts a lot more than it hurts you, believe me.\" They lifted her off the floor, and Sarah saw what had happened to her brother. Michael lay on his stomach, arms and legs still bound. The Bi-Lo bag was still covering his face. It didn't take a rocket scientist to know that he was dead. Dead. He's dead. Oh God. Oh God. Her body trembled. Everything seemed dream-like. The intruders, Michael's body, the duct tape covering her mouth … This isn't happening. This isn't happening. Wake up. Just wake up and you'll see that this is all a really, really bad dream. You'll wake up and walk out into the hallway and trip on Mike's baseball glove or stub your toe against something. But you'll be safe. There won't be anybody waiting downstairs to tie you up and torture you. You'll see. She commanded herself to wake up. She couldn't. She wasn't dreaming. So … there you go.

I jumped on the old light blue train as it was almost getting rolling. After that, I weakly leaned on the door of the train and all of my bones were burned and they were gradually melting. There was a flaming fire inside, and made me feel thirsty and breathless. It seems nothing in my body could hold my keep standing anymore. I slid along the door, don't mind if any sticky dirty liquid or plastic garbage was on the ground. \"Are you ok?\" I turned my face, saw an old benignant woman with the brown curly hair hung on her shoulders. She stooped down with a concerted look on her face, and asked again, \"Are you ok? Kids.\" \"Yes, thank you.\" I answers, \"I'm fine.\" I saw her eyes and suddenly got my power back. Her fruity voice liked a rain falling on my heart and put the inside fire out. She looked like sixty years old. And wore a light pink long skirt, the martial of the skirt was just some sample cloth. The simple but neat dressed gave her a different charm and made her very approachable. I held the door, slowly stood up. After I stood up, I flapped my hands to clean my hands and realized I even did not observe this carriage. I looked around, the light was set on the top and it was so bright so that I got a few black spot on my sight. I held on the wall, closed my eyes and wagged my head, the metallic cold sense of touch made my head sober. I blinked my eyes several times and gradually got used to the brightness. After that, the noisy sounds were vying to come to my ear. This carriage was crowded by a lot of bags instead of people. People were chatting and just threw those the bags on the aisle. Lots of seats were still unoccupied. I smelled the odorous air and it was not as terrible as I expected. As a orphan who lived in the slumdog, this smell even better than my pillow. I looked at that old lady, and said \"Thank you, I just ran too fast, I almost have missed this train.\" \"Sure, let's find a seat, do you mind if I am sitting with you?\" She asked. \"Not at all,\" I responded after a while thinking, I would rather sit with this easy-going lady than other people else. \"Here have two seat,\" I saw a two seats that closed the window and point that place to her. We hard crossed those packages and sat down. I looked at the outside window, the city countermarched fast behind me and I thought the streaking train would bring me out of the crime. I turned my head and looked the woman again, she smile on me. I responded with a smile and said \"I am too tired, do you mind I take a nap first.\" \"No, I saw you are tired, try to sleep.\" she answered. I bent my hand and closed my eyes, but I could not fell to sleep. How is her doing now? I was thinking. I knew I did the right thing, Mr. Ramakrishna, the apartment manager, said, in slumdog, people just have this super ability, which can ignore all the the miseries and adversities that happened around them, and did get any influence. I couldn't just stand and see Gudeya got violence by her father, I knew if I did't do it, no one else would help her, She really would commit suicide. \"Hey! The deafening voice startled me form my thoughts. I raised my hand and looked up. There was a strong middle-aged policeman with a long terrible scar in his face. He was impatiently looking at me and seemed to wait me doing something. What should I do, they must find my crime. I was shivering and automatically sat back more. The extremely nervousness took my breath away and I got blank in my mind. \"Hey, what's wrong with you? Tick, your tick!\" He shouted at me and saw me shivering in there and didn't speak any words out. Oh, oh, tick, he want my tick only. I franticly put my hand into every pocket and tried my best to find my tick. \"Oh, here it is.\" I handed it to him with the shivering hand. \"Ok, check it,\" he wonderingly stared at my eyes with a frown, tried to find anything that was suspicious of me. \"So weird, I feel that you're trying to hide something, are you?\" He said. \"Sure not,\" I am answering quickly. I felt my heart pounded, and my voice was taut like two sandpaper rubbed. \"Yes, he is just getting cold, let him alone. Nothing was wrong with he.\" That old woman announced that to the policeman. \"Ok, That's fine\" The policeman was staring at me for a while, then glanced at that woman. He shanked his head and went to the next carriage. I took a long breath and found I was sweating, I was like man that just got out form the river. My clothes were all wet and I felt I lost all my power. I slumped in my seat, turned my head, looked at that woman and said. \"Thank you,\" \"Just take a relief, you must be tired,\" She asked me \"do you need any food?\" while she was putting her hand on the bag and searched for some snacks. \"No, thank you, you are right, I am just too tired, let me take a nap, and everything will be ok.\" I answered in a faint voice. Then I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep. Where am I, but before I realized the location, two policemen appeared out of nowhere and said \"you are under arrest!\" to me. \"I was not killing him!\" I shouted out and waked up from the dream. Oh, thanks god, that was only a dream. However, everyone were shocked by me, they turned their face and glared at me. Some of them already felled sleep, and my shouting like a thunder in a sunny day waked them up. \"I am sorry,\" I apologized, \"just a nightmare.\" People turned back with confuse and anger in their eyes. \"What's going on in here!\" I saw the foregoing policeman went to me and queried, \"Were you just yelled right now? That's already ten o'clock. Come with me!\" I'm done, I thought. I held on the table to stood up and followed with him. I felt I was walking on the marsh. I could not feel the stability of the ground. I stumbled onward and the packages was almost tripped me down. I thought I was walking on the way of scaffold. \"Hey, what are you thinking, here!\" He saw me gazed in the ground and yelled at me. I life my hand and saw he went to a small room. I stood in front of that room, and the \"staff lounge\" was on middle of the ferrous door. I used all the energy to push the door. It was not because I lose the strength, it more liked the door became a considerable stone. \"Sit down\" he glanced at me and said with a stony face. I observed this room. The whole room was just 1.5 square meters and it was somber. A lamp was hung on the top and it seemed not be cleared since it was set. There were a lot of dark spots on the lamp-chimney. The not bright light was covered on the policeman's face, and made his face more dark and fearful. And the light also made the atmosphere gloomy. There were only two seats on the two sides of the room and a long thin table on the middle. the table is support by only one column. And a pail was under the table, I could not saw what was in it. I stood in front of the table, stared at my feet, two hands were behind my back, like a kid who made a mistake and waited for the punishment. \"I said, sat down! why are you still standing!\" he yelled. I looked up at him for one tenth of a second. And sat down on the sat. He held his head by his heads and stared at me. I could not figure our what he was thinking. \"I knew you are hiding something!\" He shouted out and pounded on the table. \"Are you a thief? Why your kids always did those bad things?\" \"No,\" I murmured, \"I am not a chief.\" I was almost crying with the tears in my eyes. And my hands was tightly grasped my cloth to keep the tears not falling down. I didn't know why, but the competitive character of a child expanded in my heart and I almost tell him that I did something that bigger than a chief. \"Ok, if you insist. Anyway I will send you to the local police in the next stop.\" He stopped look at me and took that pail that was under the table, and took out one bottle of beer from it. He leaned back on the seat, and place one arms behind his head and lay on it. \"Where are you going,\" He took a sip of the beer and asked me. \"I am going the Delhi,\" I answered, \" hum… to visit my uncle.\" What should I do, I was keeping ask myself, should I tell the truth and maybe he could let me go. I glimpsed him and he closed his eyes, sometimes took a drink. Maybe I can trust him. There is no way I could do, I thought. I decided to take this risk. I stared at him, and said firmly \"I have killed a person.\" He was drinking when I have said that. The beer spurted out form his mouth. He choked and started to cough. His one arm lay on the table and another arm kept pounded his chest. When he turned better, he looked up at me and asked \"What did you say?\" I saw tears on his red eyes and I guess he was really shocked by what I said. I clam my heart down and said \"Do you want to hear a story.\" He stared at me, thought for a moment, and nodded his head. I could not know what he was thinking, his serious face made me feel I nervous. I managed my thought and started to tell the story. \"I was lived in the slumdog, and one day, the Ram's family moved to this apartment and lived as my neighbor. Mr. Ram said he was a astronomer. Every night, I eavesdropped Mr. Ram talking about the universe. However, as time goes by, Mr. Ram started to drunken everyday. Every night he came back, he's breath threw out the foul smell of whisky. He stumbled and need other people's help to went upstairs. I didn't need the glass to help us eavesdrop. He used the highest decibel to swear. I heard the sound of hurling pots and pans. It always made me shrink into oneself, quaking with fear. Every time I heard the broken sound, it gave me the willies. One day, Mr. Ram beat his wife black and blue, and splashed the hot tea to his daughter. I went to hospital to see his daughter and made a friend with her. However, Mr. Ram didn't changed, and the situation even became worse. He even tried to do some bad thing to his daughter. I could not stand anymore, I pushed him down from the second floor and ran away today.\" After I told the story. Silence, only silence exists, I even could hear the sound of my heart beating. I observed that policeman, he looked at the window, I didn't know when he smoked a cigarette. When I looked at him, the cigarette was almost going to fire his finger. He glanced at the cigarette and pinched the butt into the ashtray. I noticed his frown never got stretched. He stared at the ashtray and kept on twirling the cigarette. I also stared at the ashtray, not dared to say a word. He looked at me, drunk down the glass of beer and said \" Do you know why I didn't connect with my colleague or the police office? Because I can feel something different in your eyes, something that most of our people have already lost. I can see the goodness in your kind heart.\" I still didn't give any response. The policeman looked at the bottle of beer, rolled it in his hand and kept said \"Why tonight beer is so strong, I'm drunk.\" He suddenly lay prone on the table. \"We will arrived at Delhi in five minutes, please get ready for your arrival.\" I heard the voice come from the aisle. I stood up and bowed my thanks to that policeman. Thank you for your trust, I said in my heart. Then I went to in front of the door, and looked outside through the window, saw the new city was gradually getting close to me. I knew the unknown are waiting for me, it might be good or bad, but I had no choice except keep going. ","Summary":" Fan Fiction OF Q&A; You can never be clam down after you killed people.

It had been hours ago, but Latika still found it hard to believe. It had been a day like any other – her dance master clapping the beat, the jangling of her jewellery filling her ears, the peace that came when she felt her body move fluidly with the music but always undermined by the knowledge that the better she danced, the quicker she would be given to some man. And then there was a sudden shout, a voice calling her name, and two boys tumbled into the room, eyes bright. Latika hadn't been surprised when Maman showed up before they could leave. It was too good to be true. Maman had spies everywhere; even if they had left they would have been caught, sooner or later. What nearly surprised her was Salim's gun. Then again, she ought to have expected it. Jamal was Jamal and Salim was Salim. She heard again the sound of a shot, and saw the man who had controlled her life sprawl on the ground, like a puppet whose strings had been cut, and suddenly he was not Maman, only a man who could die like other men. It was the first time she had seen death, but there was no room for shock or pity or delight. It was one of the first rules she had learnt. Out there, only money mattered, and it was lying in front of her. She picked it up. No room for sentiment. Jamal, she saw, still hadn't learnt. His eyes were wide and he stood there, staring at the crumpled body. She felt a twinge of pity – he was a sweet boy, he shouldn't be exposed to all this. Only later did she realise the oddness. Jamal had once taken care of her, but she had grown up, seen things that he had not, and their roles were reversed, almost. Things were different now. Salim understood, though. He was backing out, never taking his eyes off the other men, calling for his brother. Then they were out, running in fear mingled with exhilaration. It was only when she stood in the hotel room as the door swung shut that Latika understood what it meant. She was free, free from the life she had always known was waiting for her, a life filled with greedy men with greedy eyes and greedy hands who saw her only as a possession to be used. And Jamal had come back for her. The thought warmed her. She tilted her head back, hot water trickling down her body, and she smiled. Latika stepped out of the shower cautiously, but Jamal had his eyes firmly squeezed shut, even turning his head away. She looked at him and saw his earnest, honest face, and she smiled and said what she had thought earlier. \"You're a sweet boy, Jamal.\" Later, they lay on the mattress, talking. She weaved her hands through the air, the habit hard to break. Jamal propped himself up on his elbow and watched her hands move, a dance by itself. She didn't mind him watching – she felt safe with him. She could trust him. She didn't remember when they fell asleep. Latika smelt the alcohol before she opened her eyes, and Salim was there, standing over them, his eyes only on her. She knew that look, and knew what Salim would demand of her. Jamal didn't understand at first. He still thought he could reason with Salim. \"I am the elder,\" Salim said harshly. \"I am the boss. For once, you do as I say. Now get out!\" He bent towards her and held out his hand in an almost friendly gesture. \"Come on. I saved your life, didn't I?\" She said it anyway, knowing it was useless. \"Salim, please.\" And then Jamal understood, and he sprang up and threw himself at Salim. Even though Salim was drunk, he was still stronger than Jamal, and once he recovered from his shock, he grabbed Jamal and threw him out of the room, slamming the door shut, and then she was alone with Salim. Jamal was pounding on the door. \"Salim! Salim, open!\" Salim turned to her, that look still in his eyes. He moved towards her, but Jamal's yells seemed to penetrate the alcoholic haze. Pulling the gun out of his pocket, he flung open the door and held the gun to his brother's head. \"I'm giving you five seconds. One...two...\" Jamal was defiant. He didn't believe Salim would pull the trigger, but Latika had seen things like these for years. Salim would do anything right now, anything at all. Latika knew what she was going to do, as though she had planned it for years. She couldn't let Jamal die. Not Jamal. She reached the door in a few steps, and gently pushed the gun down. She felt Salim's eyes on her, but she only looked at Jamal. \"Go, Jamal,\" she said. Shock and disbelief warred in Jamal's face. He still hadn't grown up, but she knew he would. After tonight. She stepped back into the room and Salim closed it behind her, a vaguely satisfied smirk on his face. As he came towards her, she thought, was it so very bad after all? She had been brought up, she had been trained for this. Still, it wasn't easy to know that she had returned to the life she had thought she had escaped forever in the nick of time, and so when Salim's body crushed her into the mattress and his snoring sounded in her ears, she cried.

Gracias!! :D \"¿Andónde me llevas?\" La nota de miedo en mi voz era forzada y falsa.nPodía sentir el calor de su mano en la mía, y eso era suficientenpara desvanecer todas mis dudas. \"Nonvoy a arruinar la sorpresa,\" dijo él, su voz enviaba toques denemoción por mi espalda. Era difícil creer que, aun después de unnaño, siguiéramos juntos. Gruñí, siguiendo con la charada denirritación. \"Jamal,n¡Esta no es la forma de tratar a una mujer!\" lo reprendí,nabriendo mis ojos para tratar de ver a través de la bufanda amarillanque estaba atada sobre mis ojos, sin permitirme ver. \"Nonte importará en unos minutos,\" dijo, y de pronto sentí sus brazosnalrededor de mi cintura, jalándome hacia él. Sentí sus labiosnrozar mi frente, inhaló profundamente, y a través de eso sentí sunpánico. Era increíble que nada nos hubiera molestado después de unnaño de la muerte de Salim. Jamal temía que los hombres de Javed nosnbuscaran por venganza, pero hasta ahora se había equivocado. Nadienhabía venido a buscarnos, más que reporteros, aun impresionados pornel chico chaiwallah y lo que había logrado. \"Nonvoy a ninguna parte,\" le dije, sentí que se relajó por misnpalabras. \"¿Esneso una promesa?\" me preguntó. Asentí, moviendo la cabezanciegamente. Su mano capturó la mía, y sus labios rozaron mis dedosnantes de que hablara de nuevo, esta vez su sonrisa se hizo evidentenen su tono. \"Vamos,\"nme guió hacia adelante, y seguimos caminando. \"Muy bien, detentenahora.\" Me congelé y escuché sus silenciosas pisadas mientras senmovía tras de mí, girándome un poco a la derecha. Me posicionó, yndespués me soltó. \"Muy bien, ahora mira.\" Menestiré y deshice el nudo, el sol me deslumbró un poco. \"Jamal,n¿qué…?\" la pregunta murió en mis labios cuando miré hacia lancasa. Lonque me impresionó primero fue el tamaño. Había dos plazas, y senveían claramente tres habitaciones desde donde estaba. El blanconllamó mi atención después, y luego noté las líneas amarillasnsutiles a los lados. Había una terraza al lado, y una enorme ventananque brillaba con el sol. \"Jamal…esnuna casa,\" dije, mis ojos aun escaneando la construcción. Estabansorprendida. Era justo lo que había soñado, exactamente la casa quenhabía imaginando doce años atrás, lanprimera vez que Jamal me habló de crecer juntos. Misnojos se abrieron más cuando recordé, la voz joven de Jamal llenónmis oídos. \" Vamosna vivir en una enorme casa en la calle Harbour. Tú, yo y Salim: Losntres moqueteros.\" Mirénal final de la calle cuando terminé de juntar las piezas, nadansorprendida de que el anuncio de la casa declarara que estábamos ennla calle Harbour. El enorme cartel de \"VENDIDO\" me gritaba denpronto mientras veía de nuevo la casa, y cuando me giré para mirarna Jamal, tenía lágrimas en los ojos. \"Lonrecordaste,\" dije. Estuvo a mi lado al instante, con preocupaciónnen sus facciones. Negué con la cabeza, tratando de decirle que lasnlágrimas no eran malas. Estaba feliz. \"Aun cuando yo lo olvidé,ntú lo recordaste.\" Senencogió de hombros, su cara se relajó un poco. \"Es lo que hago,\"nme explicó simplemente. De pronto su mano tomó la mía, pero mensorprendió el golpe de metal. Bajé la vista, y entre nuestras manosnentrelazadas había un juego de llaves. \"¿Quieres ver elninterior?\" \"¿Elninterior?\" me había olvidado siquiera que había un interior.

Latika persuaded her. \"Nita, you've been fired and chased from your place that you stayed for,\" said Latika. \"I'm sorry for that,\" \"That's okay, Latika,\" Nita walked away from them to the kitchen. \"Maybe this is my destiny,\" Nita walked to the kitchen and crying of her fate. As she looked over the window of kitchen, she thought of Hunter as she boiled one kettle of water.. He must be get drunk again..... At the shelf, no tea, sugar or milk there. Nita only sat down on the chair as she looked over one cup of hot water. As she stared of that water vapour evaporated through the air, she remembered of her past time..... Nita..... She was being loved by her parents. She was a beautiful and smart girl in her school in one Convent school in Mumbai, India. She was so pretty until there was a guy named Gordu always keep after her to makesure she never been teased by any naughty guys out there. \"What was happen to me?\" sighed Nita, placed her head on her hand. When she was 13, she was getting married with Gordu, that time, he was 21. Even he was not educated, he lived on one big house which inherited from his family. Gordu was a nice guy, he promised to take care after Nita as well as keep after one worthful pearl. They had 3 children. Unfortunately, Gordu's income as a labour not enough to afford them, luckily Nita whom she can speak English as well. She worked as cleaner at one Convent school at Mumbai. Even her income was not too much, they lived comfortablely, Until...... Nita came to work with one of her finger broken, she complained to Farna, the principal from that school, she came from Britain that Gordu hitted her. Nita complained that Gordu always abused her as he insulted Nita for having a scandal with Hunter, the new actor whom he was so handsome and popular in the entertainment industry in India. He was getting married and lived at the end of the city of Mumbai. Nita cried again. \"Why did this thing could happen to me?\" Jamal and Latika came to her. \"Nita,\" said Latika. Nita looked over them. \"Latika, can you help me? I can't take this anymore! I lost of my job and everything that I had before,\" begged Nita. \"Don't worry, Nita. We'll help you to fix your problem.\" said Latika. \"For now, take a rest as well,\" said Jamal. 'Thanks, I'm always remembering you,\" said Nita. She walked into Latika's room and slept there. Jamal and Latika were discussing of something. \"I think we need to help her. We promised to her,\" said Jamal. \"But how are we want to help her? I haven't know much about Nita since I was young,\" said Latika. \"But she said of one name,\" \"What?\" \"Farna. If I'm not mistaken, she is a principal at St. Richard Convent School,\" \"So, do you have her school phone number?\" \"Sure I have,\" At the next day..... Jamal and Latika arrived at St. Richard Convent School by taxi. After they paid of the fare, they arrived at the gate of that school. \"Good morning, sir and madam. May I help you?\" asked the security guard. \"Sir, is this St. Richard Convent School?\" asked Jamal. \"Yes, it is. What's your purpose here?\" \"We want to meet the principal of this school, Mrs. Farna,\" said Latika. \"You're welcomed to enter to this school,\" That security guard opened the door, Jamal and Latika entered into the school and walked to the office of that school. As they arrived there, there was one 45- year- old woman came toward them. \"Does anything that you need my help?\" asked her. \"Are you.... Mrs. Farna, the principal of this school?\" asked Latika. \"Yes, I am,\" said Farna. \"Anything that you need my help?\" \"We're talking about Nita, the ex-worker of this school,\" \"Nita? Yes, she was worked here but she had been fired,\" \"But do you know what's the reason why did she been fired?\" asked Jamal. That time, Jamal, Latika and Farna discussed one another at principal's room. \"Actually, Nita had been fired due to people's says,\" said Farna. \"What do you mean?\" asked Latika. \"Since she worked here, everyone included her husband, Gordu insulted her for having a scandal with Hunter,\" \"Hunter is a movie star whom he was so famous actor in India, right?\" asked Jamal. \"True,\" said Farna. \"But I was confused. Why did she having a scandal with him?\" \"It could be right,\" said Jamal. Suddenly, Nita rushed over the scene, hiding behind the chair that Farna sat. \"Mrs. Farna, help me!\" screamed Nita. Jamal and Latika came over her, calmed her down. \"What's wrong?\" asked Latika. \"He's coming!\" screamed Nita. Actually, Gordu came over that room. That make Farna and Jamal walked forward to him to calm him down. \"Where's Nita? If I find her, I'll kill her!\" screamed Gordu. \"Mr Gordu, be calm,\" said Farna. \"Tell us why are you want to kill her,\" Latika and Nita walked away from that chair to them. Gordu looked want to kill Nita but Jamal stopped him. \"That woman that came here never love me anymore!\" screamed Gordu. \"She's so sucks! You must not let her get away! She don't have any honour anymore!\" That make Nita cried. Latika tried to stop her crying. \"Nita, stop crying,\" persuaded Latika. \"All the thing that he said was a lie! He insulted me for having scandal with Hunter and any guy out there because he was so jealous of my income which it higher than his income,\" screamed Nita. Latika believed of her words. She told Gordu. \"If Nita doesn't love you anymore, why did she crying when you insulted her for having scandal with any guy?\" \"Yeah, I believe, she is true,\" said Jamal. \"Probabaly right,\" said Farna. \"Listen here, Mr Gordu. Since Nita worked here, she was so hardworking worker that I have. She also played her role as a good mother as well,\" Unfortunately, Gordu leave that room quickly. He refused of that words. That night, it was rainy night. Nita looked over something through the window, thought of something, Why did he not accepted me back? I don't know what's my fault but..... oh, Gordu! I need your help! But I doesn't mean that Jamal and Latika not help me as well, but they're just know a little about me, but you know it more! Latika came toward her, brought of one cup of warm water. \"Hmm?\" murmured Nita, \"Nita, do you have any problem else?\" asked Latika. Nita looked over the window. Latika persuaded her. \"I know that you want him back, right?\" asked Latika. \"Yes, I'm really love him,\" said Nita. \"But why did he tell me that I had a scandal with Hunter?\" \"I don't know much about it, Nita.\" said Jamal. \"I'm sorry,\" \"Jamal, you cannot tell her like that,\" said Latika. \"Latika's right, Jamal. Gordu seemes hate me since that news of I had a scandal with Hunter spreaded around the city. He always abused me and everyday, I always came to work with new bruising, and sometimes it's get bleeding. I told Farna that I was fell in my house.\" \"But have you told her the truth?\" asked Jamal. \"I told her a few times, but everything was a same,\" said Nita, And then, there was one knocking sound from the door. Latika opened the door and...... There were 4 men rushed into the house. One guy had make Latika fainted as he covered her mouth with cotton of sleeping liquid. The rest of these guys hitted Jamal when that millionaire want to defent Nita from being teased. Unfortunately, Jamal had been hitted and he fainted. All the guy there grabbed Nita. She screamed for help but she can't do anything. One guy covered her mouth with that cotton of sleeping liquid that make her asleep. They took Nita away from that house....... A few hours later, Nita woke up. She was on the bed. She looked over surounding as she realised where was she. She was in Hunter's house! Her hand and legs had been tied. She tried to find ahything to release her out from that house. There, she saw one knife beside the bed. She tried to grab it with her hand and tried to cut the rope that tied her hand........ And finally she did it! She cut the rope that tied her legs and she was ready to get out from that house and...... The door was open! Hunter was coming there. \"How about you, Nita? Are you ready?\" Nita screamed for help but no one there. She opened the window and she jumped out from that house to the one another roof beside Hunter's house. That time, all human there saw Nita was there. Meanwhile, Jamal and Latika woke up after they fainted for 5 hours. When they heard of loud noise outside, they walked out from that house to know what was happen. As they arrived there..... \"Nita!\" Latika gasped. \"Nita, get down! We need to meet Farna for this!\" screamed Jamal. \"See? What did Gordu mentioned was true!\" said one people. \"Yeah, his ex-wife was sucks!\" said the other people. At the short story, Latika and Jamal helped her moving down from that roof and ran to St. Richard Convent School. There, they meet Farna once again to discuss of that matter. Actually, that rumour (as I mentioned) had spreaded around Mumbai city! All citizen talked much about that thing. At the principal room, \"Nita,\" said Farna. Nita walked into that room. Jamal and Latika was standing beside her, trying to get her spirit up, \"Is that true that you're in Hunter's house that time?\" asked Farna. \"Yes,\" said Nita. \"But that was happen because I always told Gordu, that I haven't all of this! But he didn't believe me otherwise he always abused me,\" \"Nita, we're pity of you,\" said Latika. \"Latika, I think we don't need to inteferent this discussment,\" said Jamal. \"Then, one day, Hunter told me. 'As Gordu still insulted you for having scandal with me, we better keep doing it' ,\" said Nita. \"How dare he told you like that,\" said Latika, \"Maybe he want something from you, Nita,\" said Jamal. \"But I agreed of his words. Furthermore,...\" Nita cried. \"Gordu didn't believe me anymore,\" Since that, Farna asked the school administriation for give a job for Nita once again as she can change her life with one condition, Nita must beware of her behaviour. Maybe one small behaviour that she done make a big shame for that school. And the school accepted her to work there again. That night....... Nita sat looking over the window, she disn't know what else that she want to say to Farna for giving her second chance to work with her. Latika came over her. \"Nita, what are you thinking for? You have your own job, right?\" asked Latika. \"I don't know what else that I want to say, Latika,\" said Nita. \"But I remembered of something..... it's more hurting me,\" \"What's that?\" That make Nita muted for a while, she shown of her neck which it rounded with scars. \"Nita, what's wrong with you? Why did this thing happen to you?\" asked Latika. \"Actually...\" said Nita, she cried. \"As Gordu heard of people's word of my scandal with Hunter (even I didn't that), he was so angry until he snatched my wedding necklace in front of my children. Then, he chased me out from the house. He said, \"Get out! You're such a damn bitch! You never see your children again!\" ,\" \"I'm sorry of that,\" \"What happen, Latika?\" asked Jamal. \"Nita told me, she had been divorced by Gordu, maybe before we meet her,\" said Latika. \"And.... that scene also happened to Hunter's family. His wife asked him for divorce and she ran away from him. He stayed alone. Moreover, I've been dumped by my own family, then I moved into Hunter's house, even I knew that I was wrong,\" said Nita. \"But you tried to get your protection,\" said Jamal. \"But it didn't finish yet,\" \"What happen next to you, Nita?\" asked Latika. \"After that, Hunter and I were getting married but the Catholic Church didn't bless our marriage. After we getting married, Hunter always spend my money for buying beer and if I didn't obey of him, he'll abused me....\" Nita cried. Latika and Jamal persuaded her. \"And thyen, Farna advised me for lefting him, but I can't,\" said her again. \"She's right, Nita,\" said Latika. \"She doesn't want you being tortured by beast-hearted human like him,\" \"I think so,\" said Jamal. \"We'll tell Farna about this,\" Nita dried her tears. \"Thanks, Latika, Jamal. Godd always bless both of you,\" At the next day, Jamal, Latika and Nita came to St. Richard Convent School to meet Farna. At Principal's room, \"May I help you?\" asked Farna. \"Madam Farna, can we talk for a while?\" asked Jamal. At the same time, Nita whom standing beside Latika, fainted. Latika and Jamal woke her up, but she didn't wake up. There, Latika shocked of some injured on Nita as she saw some scars and broken bones on Nita's hand and legs. There, Nita had been sent into the hospital but she only given a light treatment as she need taken to police station. There, Farna persuaded Nita for being taken there to investigated by police for her injury. \"Hunter had abused you! This is not a light case,\" said Latika. \"Okay, I'll following you,\" said Nita. But.... When they arrived there, Nita changed her mind. \"Hunter is my husband. He can do anything to me,\" said Nita. Jamal and Latika shocked. \"Are you serious?\" asked Farna. \"Yes,\" \"Nita, I don't know what do you said but you need to leave Hunter before it's too late,\" said Jamal. \"Yeah, he's right,\" said Farna, then she muted for a while. \"Farna, why are you...\" said Latika. \"Actually, I need to leave Mumbai for a month. But I want to advise you one, leave Hunter as you'll safe as I know,\" said Farna. \"No,\" said Nita. All of them shocked. \"Hunter not doing bad to me. He's a nice guy. I love him. When he not drunk, he can make me happy. I can't live without him,\" That make Farna almost give up as he heard Nita said to her. Jamal and Latika confused. Why did thing happen to her? Is she mad? A month later..... Nita prepeared herself for going to work, but the door opened suddenly, and a few polices rushed there, caught her. She screamed. Jamal and Latika arirved there. \"What's wrong?\" asked Jamal. Farna arrived there. She came after a month in overseas. \"Farna, what's wrong with Nita?\" asked Latika. \"Listen here. Nita is arrested for stealing.\" said the police. \"STEALING?\" Latika shocked. \"Nita stole all my things in principal house of St. Richard Convent School, her workplace,.... It was suspected by the inner person and Nita is the suspect that wanted for,\" \"So, where's your proof of my offence?\" asked Nita. \"You're the one whom had the second key of that house. Do you have it?\" Nita admitted it as she took out that key from her pocket. \"Furthermore, Hunter always seen by the security guard as he walked around the school area,\" said the police. \"Yes, he did,\" said Nita. \"Hunter is my husband. But he came for take me home,\" \"But you don't have enough proof that you're not a suspect. Follow us into the police station,\" Nita taken into the police station. When she was investigated by the police, she defent herself that Hunter is not guilty. \"We didn't do anything even stealing any thing! Please, police. I don't know anything about this!\" Farna tried to get a proof that Nita was not a suspect. Jamal and Latika were also finsing it but.... they arrived at the dead road. Finally, Nita sentenced into prison for 3 months. She also fired from her job for second time. 3 months later..... Nita sat against the wall of the lock-up. She cried and grieved of her misfortune...... What was happen to me? Why am I here? I'm such a disgusting human! There, one warden opened the door. Nita walked out as she had been released. As she walked out from the police station, Jamal and Latika waited for her. \"Thanks for bailing me,\" said Nita. \"I can't take it anymore,\" \"Actually, I'm not bailed you,\" said Jamal. \"But whom?\" Hunter arrived there. He bailed Nita from the prison. Nita shocked. \"I heard that you're fired for second time three months ago. And....\" said Hunter. \"You've stole something from your workplace, right?\" Nita muted for a while. \"Just ignore it! What the damn useless job,\" said Hunter, his mouth breathe smell of beer. Nita and Latika covered their nose with their clothes. \"Hunter, I know that you want to take her back and...\" said Jamal. \"I don't want anyone inteferent this scene!\" screamed Hunter. Jamal and Latika leave them there. Then, Hunter stared to Nita and he whispered of something. \"I have something that better to you,\" Then, he whispered of his evil plan, started from Nita's scandal with him, people's story of her bad behaviour to her ex-husband and she stole something at her workplace. All of that were his evil plan! Nita was really angry. She screamed as she threw one brick to his head. She slapped across his face, scolded him for descending her. She felt as she standing on his body. Meanwhile, Jamal and Latika meet Gordu suddenly when they're going home. \"Hey! I've meet you before,\" said Gordu. \"Are you.... Nita's husband?\" asked Jamal. \"That's a history,\" \"She's in police station,\" said Latika. \"Ignore her!\" said Gordu. \"But....\" said Jamal. They walked home. A few hours later..... They saw Nita walked toward them. She dragged fainted Hunter toward them. \"What the?\" Gordu shocked.

She didn't know what else she want to do as Hunter almost dead. \"Nita,\" said Gordu. \"Can you come back to me?\" Gordu hugged Nita. They stared each other as their relationship as husband and wife.... tied up once again. That house was so silent when Nita nodded her head as she agreed of Gordu asked of being his wife once again.

How dare someone trying to ruin her down. She need to face all of this herself,\" said Latika. \"So we were,\" said Jamal. The End Moral Value: Keep holding on..... for having your hard life. Okay, what once again a bad story. Whatever, Enjoy! ","Summary":" Scars and Tears by VeekaIzhanez The story of my first Slumdog Millionaire OC, her name is Nita. She"},{"Movie":"Slumdog Millionaire","Title":"Snapshot","Author":"Devin Trinidad","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10712060","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Foreground: the part of a scene or picture that is nearest to and in front of the viewer. A woman, pushing through her middle age pulls out a picture from an envelope and opens it. Sighing, she traces the faces of two young children. They were both young and old, frail yet sturdy, innocent and yet so very tainted with the corruption with life. The young youths were standing in the foreground of the picture, their forms outlined by the weak sun and the heaping mounds of endless trash. It was both a beautiful sight and yet so very sad. The smiles were engraved on their faces for an eternity, but the poverty and loneliness were still located deeper into their souls. \"Jamal! Salim!\" A young girl, less then ten years of age frantically shook awake her two traveling companions. Her eyes, usually timid and passive, were now pulsing with sudden life and determination. Her calloused hands—from work at picking apart the trash dump they were staying at—pulled at the boys' t-shirts and their pants. When nothing else seemed to stir those two awake, the young girl decided to slap them into the living. \"Ah,\" Salim moaned harshly. His deep brown eyes, once innocent and carefree, hardened as he took in the gleeful looking girl. While most would have regarded this as a welcoming sight, he just threw some plastic at her to make her quiet. \"Shut up! I told you that I didn't want to wake up until later!\" Abruptly, Latika pulled away from waking up her friend, a submissive stance taking over her. This was normal behavior, especially since she was still settling into the brothers' different dynamics. However, it still stung to know that Salim was still biting at her harshly because of her abrupt intrusion into his life. Settling back on her haunches, she stared hard at the dirt floor, obviously not wanting to anger the young man further. Meanwhile, the youngest boy in the group furiously rubbed at the crust in his eyes, his sleepy gaze just barely leaving him. \"Latika,\" the young boy mumbled. Unlike his elder brother, the younger one didn't hold ill will towards the girl. It was him that invited her to come along with him after they had lost their only family members. Besides, who else could fill in the vacant spot for the third musketeer? \"Is something wrong?\" The young girl looked up and cautiously smiled at the younger boy. \"Yes, I thought that we could get our pictures taken today!\" She clapped her hands excitedly, obviously smitten with the idea. It was also quite obvious that she tried her hardest not to give Salim too much reason to start snapping at her—it was enough that she was chosen to tag along with them. Unfortunately, the cynical side of the leader of this ragtag crew of orphans had to interject with his pessimism. \"Get that stupid idea out of your head. No one in this wretched place has enough to buy a camera and who would want to take a picture of you!\" With one final huff, the young boy decided that enough was enough. He collapsed on his makeshift bed in the tent and pretended to go back to sleep. Frowning, the younger of the two males decided to humor the third musketeer. Signaling her to be quiet, he motioned for her to go outside while he reorganized his pallet on the dirt. Finding nothing amiss, the Indian lad hauled himself out of the tent and into the abhorrent stench of the landfill they were currently residing in. Once he was outside and fully awake, the boy was pulled by his arms and into a westerly direction. \"Where are we going?\" Jamal asked curiously. Were they truly getting their pictures taken? And if so, how were they doing that? Questions of the sort flitted into Jamal's mind, but he was effectively silenced when Latika placed a finger on his lips. Jamal noticed that her fiendish grin made her look lively and far more colorful than the grungy landscape that they were usually toiling in. He quite liked the way her lips curved upwards and how her dark, dark eyes seemed to glow and brighten in this state. It almost seemed that none of the bad things had ever happened to him. That maybe, just maybe, he could forget all the negative and enjoy in the positives. For example, he could focus on the dazzling sunlight that Latika seemed to personify. \"We're not leaving Salim are we?\" Latika laughed like she was one of those dazzling heroines in the movies; the picture perfect damsels in distress who waited for their prince. \"Silly boy, of course not! A blonde lady has a camera and she's taking pictures of the trash! When she saw me, she asked if she could take a picture of me,\" the girl's eyes glimmered even more happily when she recalled even more of the event. \"She said that I was very pretty and that she was honored to take my picture…But!\" She wagged her dirty fingers in front of Jamal's face—there was a cute smile on his face too, \"I told her that if she wanted to take my picture, she had to take my friend's too!\" Beaming, Jamal held her hand even tighter than before. It wasn't necessarily very tight, only enough so that Latika knew that he was grateful to join her on this little crusade of theirs. For some odd reason, the warmth that was brought about between their contact seemed to be very warm, almost unbearable. And yet, Jamal liked her warmth. Suddenly, a thought occurred to him. \"What about Salim? I bet he would like his picture taken too!\" A sad smile was on Latika's face as she answered. She was still grateful for the both of them, for taking her in and letting her share with their meager food. However, she was still a bit wary of his older brother. \"Jamal, I already asked him, but he said no.\" Both fell silent. The only sound that could be heard from that point on was the shuffling of children's feet as they picked their way through the endless mounds of refuse. For most it would have been challenging, for them it was only a mundane chore. Time was slow for them and in this place it was pretty close to standing pretty still. It was no surprise that they found the tourist just casually taking pictures of some trash and looking very bored. \"Well lookie here! Your boyfriend's pretty cute,\" the blonde woman laughed merrily. She ran over to the two children, eyeing them carefully. The first thing that Jamal noticed was the fact that her hair was like the rays of the sun when it was midday. Strands coiled around her head in a fashionable hairdo, haloing her face in ways that neither of the two Indian natives could have ever hoped to understand. Her eyes, blue and distant like glass, pierced through Jamal's soul. For some odd reason, he was flung to the past when he saw Allah Rama… \"—and here's my friend Jamal! Say hello!\" If it weren't for Latika pinching the underside of his arm, Jamal wouldn't have left the nightmare of what happened many moons ago. \"H-hello,\" Jamal mumbled. Normally an outgoing and courageous soul, he only stuttered because this was his first time meeting someone so un-Indian like—and his memories were still there at the back of his mind. The woman grinned, although a bit absently. \"What about your other friend? Doesn't he want to get his picture taken?\" Latika shook her head. \"No, madam, he felt too tired.\" The woman shrugged, two was more than enough for her little excursion in the outskirts of the town. Toying with her camera for a few seconds, she pointed at a random spot of the junkyard. At first, Jamal was confused as to why she chose this spot. Was there something interesting there that caught her eye? Or was this foreigner only fickle with her photo-taking expertise? Seeing the look of dumb surprise, the woman decided to treat her subjects to an explanation. \"I like how this area seems to be nearly empty of the trash, allowing you two to stand…however, while there appears to be nothing where you stand, when I focus my camera, in the background there are large mounds of trash. It's almost picturesque if it weren't for the poverty,\" the woman pursed, thinking silently before adding, \"The grey clouds that are rolling in provide some nice atmosphere too.\" Both of the two children remained silent, awaiting her orders. Once she was done mumbling to herself, she pointed at her lips, a sure sign that she wanted them to smile. Click. There was a slight shutter sound that rang out through the nearly empty expanse. The woman paused for a moment to snag a look at her camera before nodding to herself. Raising her camera, she pressed the button a few more times to capture the look innocence in the duo's young but haggard faces. Sneaking a look at the pictures she had had taken at the menu screen, a look of achievement filled her face. Two children, bathed in the glow of the dying sun, had their picture taken at a landfill...but they looked so pleased about it that the lady couldn't help but smile. Truly, this was one picture that she would never forget. Once she was done with that, the blonde woman smiled to herself. \"Alright,\" she chirped happily. \"I believe that is all.\" Her bright blue eyes twinkled in mischief. There was something in her orbs that wanted Jamal to run away and take Latika away with him. Was she going to do something to them? Fortunately his suspicions were unfounded when the lady fished a few bills from her purse and handed them to Latika. \"B-but, miss!\" The young girl nearly choked in surprise. While not exactly knowledgeable when it came to money, the bills looked like they were bogged down with a weighty responsibility. Just how much was the currency worth? Tempted to keep the bills to herself, Latika found herself handing the money over to the kind lady, but she was met with an unyielding kindness. \"This is…I can't…\" The kind lady gave her a smile before shooing her away. \"Don't worry about it! Besides, I got to go.\" The two young children watched in silence as the tourist picked her way silently through the trash. There were some muttered curses, but she made her way towards the main road where a man waited for her in a truck. Without looking back, the foreigner had seated herself in the front and the man had closed the door. Soon after, the sound of wheels squealing through the muck of the landfill filled the stagnant air. \"She seemed nice.\" Jamal noted. \"A little bit of a loony, but nice.\" Latika laughed in an amused manner, ruffling Jamal's short hair as she did so. \"You're too kind, Jamal. You're too kind!\" The two children walked slowly back to where they had set up camp, cautious as to not awaken Salim. However, their efforts were for nothing, seeing that the oldest of the group was glaring at some garbage. Salim was staring a few meters away from the tent and from the way he was standing—shoudlers hunched and his arms over his chest—he was clearly in one of his angered moods. Annoyance and dangerous vibes fell off his form in fumes. Because of this, Jamal tightened his group on Latika's hand, slightly dreading and slightly curious as to what was going to happen. \"You got your stupid pictures,\" Salim muttered. He didn't turn his head to look at his travelling companions, only choosing to kick at the dirt in their direction. Latika hummed. \"Yes, Salim.\" An angered look crossed her soft features when she realized that he wasn't going to talk again. \"Look! We even got paid.\" Insisting that Jamal's brother look at the wad of bills that were in her tight fists, she marched over to Salim and threw the paper money at his glowering visage. \"What?\" The boy bowed down to look at the money that was barely getting dirt on its face. There was a man printed on the green bill; he was an old, pasty looking fellow with a clean-shaven face. The look of surprise—greed, selfishness, the eyes of a poverty stricken orphan—that was Salim's dirty face contrasted quite nicely with the man's tranquil expression. One by one, the boy grabbed the bills, counting to himself silently. There were five six bills, presumably three for each who were photographed. Even though they didn't know the true worth of the foreign money, this was far more than what they actually got in a month. \"Latika…Jamal…\" Salim began slyly. \"Tonight we feast!\" Without preamble, he stuffed the bills into one of the pockets of his shorts and crept back into the tent. Within seconds, the Indian boy was back out, a plastic bag in hand so that they could bag future purchases and the like. \"You did well,\" Salim congratulated. With a slap on both of their backs, he led the way towards the city. Neither of the two saw how well he masked his hurt at being left out. His younger playmates also didn't realize that the reason that he was able to hide it so well was because of his greed for something better. Money made everything better.

Said something that he wouldn't come because he would think that it was stupid or the like.\" Once done with her album, she fished out a worn bill from her purse, as if it was a reminder of what happened on that one day. \" She told me that he might come if there was something that would benefit all of them…\" Her eyes—blue like the skin of the Allah Rama, the one present at the massacre—twinkled and she dropped the bill back into her purse. \"So of course, I had to give them money, but the other lad didn't show.

I slowly opened my eyes, and screamed; looking at two pairs of large eyeballs staring right at me. I rolled off the bed and cowered into a corner of my room. The sun was so bright I could barely see. I squinted and looked back, where a teenage looking girl was sitting. \"Sorry, Aisha Akka. I didn't mean to scare you.\" I grunted and went into the bathroom. The walls were white, with fungus in the corners. It was gross, but not unusual in India. The sink was a yellow color, matching with the tub and toilet. They had once been white, but judging by how many people came into this bathroom eating paan, it was bound to turn yellow anyway. \"Mummy said to get ready soon, Aisha Akka! We need to go out!\" What's with Indian people and getting up early? I thought. \"Why? Can't you give me a break? I reach here just last night, freaking out because I was told Taiku was very sick. Then I came home to see Taiku looking perfectly fine!\" I croaked, while at the same time ranting. Coming home was overwhelming for me. I hadn't been back in India since I graduated college. Home is one of those places I wanted to be only once in a while. \"Yes, Akka. I know. But, you know Mummy….\" She trailed off, remembering the important rule of the household. Do not disrespect elders, anytime. I sighed, and stepped into the bathtub, and turned the water on. \"Why am I here?\" I shouted over the roar of water. \"There was a knock at the door. \"What, Mimi?\" I asked. \"You could have just yelled, stupid!\" \"I will not yell. I will not tolerate being called stupid. If I had known they would teach this language ...\" I could not see who it was, but by the voice I could tell the person, who was not agreeing with America. \"I would not of agreed to send you. Now hurry up. We are leaving soon.\" \"Sorry Mummy. Of course Mummy.\" Sorry my ass. I thought. Yep, you just met my mother. Great good old mum, whose goal in life was to make MY life miserable.

I was shocked it was there. It wasn't the last time I came. \"Aisha!\" Mummy yelled. \"Coming Mummy!\" I sighed. There goes my freedom I walked into my living room where my very large and extended family were sitting. I was suspicious. \"What's going on?\" I asked. \"Well, Aisha… we have to talk to you\" An middle aged man sitting on the swinging bench. I ran to him and hugged him, the smell of Medimix soap wafted off of him. \"Papa, its so good to see you.\" Papa was the only thing I missed in India. His smile was the greatest so far I had ever seen. But today he was not smilling. \"Aisha. We brought you here so you can get married.\" I looked at him waiting for the 'just kidding!' part of the sentence. But it never came.

Don't own it, no copyright infringement intended, I make no profits off this. Slumdog Millionaire was a stunningly beautiful movie. I wrote this as a possible insight into Latika's feelings, as we see a lot of what Jamal feels for Latika, but what are the depth and extent of her feelings for him? xxx Her only memory as a very young child is of warm hands combing through her dark hair, whispering words that she didn't understand but was comforted nonetheless. They were words of love, and of admiration for the beauty of her hair. Beauty was to her both a blessing and a curse. As an older child, the loss of her mother left her orphaned in the slums. She later learned that he, too, lost his mother in the same killing. Jamal was the first to be kind to her. The other children outcast her because she did not know who her father was. The kinder adults saw her beauty and pitied her. Most just ignored her. A curse because the king of the beggars knew she would be a beauty, that's why he tried so hard to get her back, spent so much money on her, teaching her to dance. She knew Jamal was pulled along by his brother. He wanted money he could get by selling her for her beauty. A blessing, perhaps, because she was well fed and sheltered in those years, not blinded and singing like the others. His brother, Salim. She knew, just like he killed the beggar king, he would kill Jamal if he could not have her. Oh, the look in his eyes. His brother had brought him a prize. It was not shelter in the same place like all those years ago in the rain. She knew his cruelty even then. Sending Jamal away, the only thing she could do to save him. The hardest thing she's ever had to do, knowing what was going to happen now, but Jamal would not see, that was enough. Jamal, who looked her straight in the eyes and not at her figure. The physical pain dulled, tears ran down her face silently not for herself but for him, Jamal. She didn't know that not only was Salim plain cruel, he was utterly heartless. She was his ticket to the inner circle of the gangster surrounding the hateful, hateful man who ruled the slums of her childhood. She knew it was her beautiful face next to his that he wanted, her body in the night. The Jamal came and again, her beauty was both a blessing and a curse. Did it bring him to her for the sake of a beautiful possession, like the others? She looked into his eyes, after he refused to be pushed away, even if for his own safety. She realised she mustn't meet people's eyes often, not liking what she say day after day. His were the only ones. The pure intensity made her heart break over again, and from then she never doubted. It was ironic, when Salim cut her when she was trying to escape to his brother. Marring her face. A punishment? It was almost a mark of pride, of defiance. They mutilate what mattered to them most, not to her. It was a curse that she was chosen for safety, for a full stomach, or the horror of this beautiful prison, all for her face. She ran because it didn't matter anymore, she could be happy with Jamal. To be looked at with love, and tenderness, it would be worth the struggle. But she was too big a prize. Did he feel he redeemed himself, letting her go? Maybe the pain he inflicted on herself and his own brother finally caught up to him. That separating them was cruelty itself. She knew he would be killed. He knew it too- perhaps, that final look he gave her, his low spoken apology, he expected forgiveness, for her to brush the back of her hand along his cheek and smile the tiny smile that was all she could manage since she was brought here in his wake. She didn't. There was simply understanding, and with that, there was acknowledgement. He could not begin to forgive himself. She would not feel guilt. Then she was running, already running, Jamal had not won, and he may lose everything but she ran still. The phone was in her car. He would know she is alive would know she wants to see him again... \"I don't know. I don't know!\" It doesn't even matter, what the answer is. She would be waiting at the train station forever. The thought of him kept her sane- his innocence and purity remained through all the suffering and hardships he endured, surviving even the betrayal of his brother. She would come to him. Salim- who gave her his phone, who would lead her back to Jamal at last. But he was in the past. Now, there was only ever the future to look to. xxx ","Summary":" Holding your Heart- a Slumdog Millionaire Companion Disclaimer: FAN fiction.

So the white men will want you.\" Latika turns the razor in her hands and wets her lips. Jamal is just out the door, two hours back, and he will not return for her this time. He will not. \"I don't know how,\" she says, quite honestly. Salim frowns at her impatiently. \"Learn how,\" he tells her, and folds his arms. She waits for him to leave the room. He doesn't. And in the end, she admits, it doesn't really make a difference. She braces one foot against the bathtub, bends over and sweeps the blade up her leg slowly, like she has seen on television. It catches at her ankle, drawing blood so dark and red, it is almost as though she can peer up her vein. She keeps at it. When she looks up, Salim has his arms crossed, leaning heavily against the wall. He keeps taking his gun out and looking at it. \"I'm done,\" she says, and adds with due consideration, \"Maybe—in a couple hours. So the scabs can form.\" His gaze dips down her legs, pooling with her blood around her ankles. The corners of his mouth tighten. He looks away. \"A few days,\" he says harshly, \"You'll practice. Get better. I can't hand you over like this. No one wants a girl with scabs.\" She doesn't know if he's being selfish, or kind. Salim pushes off the wall with the backs of his hands, stalking towards her, his jaw line tense. She glances at his gun, cradled loosely in his left hand, and then looks back up. She swallows. \"You see this?\" he gestures out the window with his gun, one hand on her upper arm, turning her to the view, his head dropping down to speak low and fast in her ear, \"This is what you would have been left with. I won't let that happen, yeah?\" She looks at the streets below them, the girls and women hanging out of window, their hands brown and shining with the sweaty heat, grabbing at clothes. Men, young or old, thin or fat, disgusting, using, recycling, and she says nothing, moves docile and silent when he turns her back to face him. \"You and me,\" he points the gun, at himself, at her, \"We're getting out of here. My boss has a wife, you know. I'll kill her. And you? This is your job. You're going to learn how to make him happy. You're going to marry him.

You're right. But I don't need to be happy. No one's happy. People don't want to be happy, people want to be miserable and starving because if they aren't, they learn to be fat and complacent, and the money they eat tastes like paper and filth.\" \"Salim,\" she says finally, \"You don't need me for this.\" \"I don't need anyone,\" he tells her harshly, fingertips sharp. Carefully, she picks the gun from his grip and sets in on the counter behind her with a soft click. He watches her with burning, dark eyes. \"We're better than this,\" he says finally, coldly, jerking his chin at the window again, \"I don't want to leave you here, Latika.

Bagaimana dia melakukannya? A. Dia Curang C. Dia Jenius B. Dia Beruntung D. Hal ini telah \"ditulis\" Dan ini berawal di salah satu ruang bawah tanah tempat Akbar diperiksa, lebih tepatnya disiksa mengenai \"keberuntungannya\" Jakarta, 2006 (Akbar duduk dengan tangan terikat di sebuah kursi, dilecuti oleh seorang Polisi) P : Siapa namamu. A : (melamun, tubuh penuh keringat) P : (menampar Akbar) Aku bertanya padamu : Siapa namamu?! A : (tersadar, menatap nanar) Akbar…Akbar Abdul Jafar… P : Bagus, kau punya nama. Dan berhentilah menangis. Si Polisi mengajukan beberapa pertanyaan bertemakan bagaimana ia berbuat curang, yang hanya dibalas dengan tatapan kosong dari Akbar yang pikirannya berkelebat tentang seorang wanita, lalu sebuah acara tv yang ia ikuti, lalu kembali ke wanita itu, berulang kali. Si polisi melecuti Akbar sebagai balasannya, sampai seorang Inspektur berpakaian rapi masuk ke ruangan. Y : (marah) Apa yang kau lakukan padanya?! Kita hanya butuh jawaban, tapi kau melanggar HAM. (berkeliling ruangan dengan frustasi) Apa kau menemukan chip atau barang lainnya? P : (tertunduk, menghentikan aksinya) Tidak ada apa – apa selain dompet berisi beberapa koin dan dia tidak memberi jawaban selain namanya. Aku sudah mencoba berkali – kali… Y : Itu karena caramu yang salah! Lihat, sekarang ia pingsan! Aku masih banyak pekerjaan dan harus tersendat untuk memeriksa dia. Beri dia pakaian baru dan bawa ke kantor. P : (mengangguk dan melepaskan ikatan tangan Akbar) A : (tiba – tiba tersadar, terengah - engah) Jawaban…Aku sudah tahu jawabannya dari awal… Y dan P : (terkejut) Di kantor polisi Y : (menghampiri Akbar yang telah terduduk di depannya, siap diperiksa) Jadi…Akbar, orang yang tahu segala jawaban. Bicaralah. A : (diam) P : (dari belakang menempeleng kepalanya) Dia bilang \"Bicara\"! (Akbar tetap diam, Johan memutar rekaman acara \" Who Wants To Be A Millionaire Indonesia \" tadi malam.) Suara dari tv (bold letters) Fr: Jadi, Akbar…Duduk di kursi panas, bersiap untuk mendapatkan uang, tidakkah lebih baik dibanding menjadi Office Boy ? A : (ragu – ragu) Ya…tidak…ya. (penonton tertawa) Fr: Sepertinya ada yang gugup disini. Baiklah, ingat, kau punya tiga garis pengaman : 50:50, Telepon Teman, dan Survei Penonton. (berhenti sejenak) Untuk pertanyaan pertama, senilai 1 juta rupiah : Siapakah actor ternama pada film \"Macho\" tahun 1994? (kembali ke kantor polisi) A : Sedari kecil aku mengidolakannya, aku bahkan berhasil mendapat tanda tangannya saat dia melintas di Cengkareng. Kau tidak perlu menjadi pintar untuk itu. F : Dan jawabanmu benar! Kau baru saja memenangkan 1 juta rupiah! P : Aku tahu jawabannya Barry Prima. A : (nada meremehkan) Seperti yang kubilang, kau tidak perlu jadi jenius.

Y : Anak perempuanku yang berumur lima tahun bisa menjawabnya. Seorang jutawan sepertimu tidak bisa. Aneh…Apa kau lansung kehabisan contekan? A : (menantang Yohana) Berapa harga Bakpau Srilanka di Kompleks 3? Y : (terkejut) Apa? P : (menyeletuk) Tiga ribu rupiah. A : Salah, selalu lima ribu rupiah sejak pertama kali buka. (menatap Yohana lagi) Siapa yang mencuri sepeda Pak Rujo dua hari yang lalu? Y : Kau tahu? A : (nada mengejek) Semua orang di Jakarta Pusat tahu itu. Bahkan anak umur lima tahun. Y : (tersenyum) Fr: 3 juta rupiah! (penonton bertepuk tangan riuh) Fr: Untuk 5 juta rupiah…tentang keamanan negara…menarik sekali. Pada saat itu, pikiran Akbar kembali ke masa lalunya, ketika ia, Farhan kakaknya dan Ibunya hidup tenang di perumahan kumuh Cengkareng. Saat itu, ibunya sedang mencuci pakaian, mereka sibuk bermain air. Menatap ke jalanan, ia berfirasat buruk. Dari kejauhan, terdengar bunyi sirine. Cengkareng, 1993 (Ibu Akbar lansung kembali ke rumah, membereskan pakaian ke dalam koper lusuh milik almarhum suaminya. Beliau memanggil Farhan) I : (berlutut, menahan tangis) Farhan, bawa koper ini. Ini perlengkapan yang kalian butuhkan, kalian mungkin tidak akan bersekolah lagi di SDTergaman, tapi kalian tetap anak yang pintar. Ibu masih punya kerabat di Bandung, Bibi Riska akan mengurus kalian sekarang.(menarik napas)Farhan…kamu sudah besar, bisa janji sama ibu, Nak? F : (takut) Ada apa,bu? Ibu biasanya tidak begini… I : (menangis, menepuk bahu Farhan) Farhan, jaga adikmu demi Ibu, ya? F : (terdiam, lalu mengangguk pelan) I : (mengusap air matanya) Sekarang, pergilah! Pergilah sejauh mungkin! Farhan berlari secepat kilat menghampiri Akbar, menariknya dari got kumuh belakang rumah mereka dan terus berlari menggandeng adiknya yang protes kenapa mereka kabur dari rumah. Suaran sirine, bangunan roboh dan teriakan warga Cengkareng yang familiar di telinga Farhan membuat dia mempercepat larinya. A : (terengah – engah) Kenapa kita berlari seperti ini? Kita mau kemana? F : (masih terus berlari) Kita akan ke tempat Bibi Riska di Bandung! A : Untuk apa?! Ibu bagaimana?! Memang ada apa di tempat kita, Kak? F : (menoleh sejenak) Diam sajalah! Terus lari! (Akbar berhasil melepaskan genggaman kakaknya, membuat Farhan berhenti sejenak dengan napas terengah – engah.) A : Jujurlah, kak! Emang ada apa?! F : (bingung, dan akhirnya bicara dengan berat hati) Ibu sudah tiada… A : (membelalakkan mata) Tidak mungkin… F : (menunjuk ke arah perumahan yang berasap) Kau lihat itu? Itu pemakamannya. A : (menoleh, lalu mengelengkan kepalanya)Tidak…TIDAK! Kau bohong (menangis) F : (menghela napas) Selalu seperti ini tiap tahun, Akbar. Tahun kemarin Ciliwung, sekarang rumah kita. Kata mereka demi keamanan dan kebersihan negara, tapi mereka menghancurkan rumah kita dan membunuh penduduk. (berteriak tak jelas) MELINDUNGI DAN MELAYANI MASYARAKAT KATAMU?! Pergi ke Neraka sana! A : (terisak) siapa yang kamu bicarakan? F : (seringai mengejek) Huh, itu slogannya P-O-L-I-S-I. Polisi. Jadi, kamu jangan pernah Bekerja sebagai polisi,ya? Ayo, perjalanan kita masih panjang (membantu Akbar bangun) Dua bersaudara ini melanjutkan perjalanan mereka ke arah Timur, hendak mencapai Bandung hanya dengan jalan kaki, berhubung ibu mereka tidak meletakkan banyak uang di koper layaknya para pejabat pemerintahan. Sementara itu, seorang gadis kecil mengikuti mereka sepanjang jalan. (hujan lebat disertai petir menggelegar, Akbar dan Farhan berteduh di sebuah gudang beras. Sang gadis berdiri termenung di tengah jalan beberapa meter dari gudang, basah kuyup.) F : (berteriak ke arah sang gadis) Pergilah! Kau hanya akan membawa penjaga gudang kesini! A : Tidak bisakah kita membawanya masuk? F : (menunjuk diri sendiri) Aku yang tertua disini, aku yang memutuskan. Dia hanya akan jadi beban. A : Dia bisa jadi Musketeer ketiga. F : Kita saja tidak hapal nama the Three Musketeers. (menguap) Sudahlah, aku mau tidur. (berbaring membelakangi Akbar) A : (memastikan Farhan tertidur, lalu memanggil si gadis) Hey, masuklah! Tak apa! (memberi handuk kepada si gadis) S : (mengelap badannya) Terima kasih. A : Aku Akbar, dan yang berbaring itu kakakku Farhan. Dimana orang tuamu? S : Aku Sasi. Orang tuaku sudah lama meninggal. Kami dari Ciliwung. A : (menunduk sedih) Maaf…Mmm…Kau boleh tidur disini jika kau mau. Hari – hari berikutnya harus mereka jalani dengan mengais sampah, mencari beberapa peser rupiah untuk makan. Pada suatu siang yang sangat panas, dua pria bertandang ke rumah kotak mereka, memberi mereka minuman dingin. Kemudian, mengajak mereka ke sebuah rumah terpencil di dekat stasiun kereta Kalideres, dimana anak – anak jalanan lainnya tinggal. Mereka diberi makan dengan cukup, mungkin berlebih, dan diberi tempat tinggal, itulah yang terpenting. Wanita setengah baya bernama Bridal itu bagai titisan malaikat bagi mereka. Namun, itu hanyalah sementara. Mereka harus mengamen dan mengemis di perempatan jalan raya untuk tetap bisa tinggal disana. Dan pada suatu malam, setelah \"kontes\" menyanyi di rumah tua itu, Farhan yang sekarang menjabat sebagai assistant anak buah Bridal diperintahkan membawa Alfi, musisi muda mereka. B : (duduk di depan Alfi) Nyanyikan lagu \"Malam Yang Biru\" Al : (menyanyi dengan merdu) B : Baiklah, baiklah. Penampilan yang sangat memukau. Sekarang, berbaliklah. Al : (berbalik dan pingsan karena dibius anak buah Bridal) AnB: (membaringkan Alfi, menyiapkan sendok panas, dan mencongkel matanya) F : (melihat hal diatas, berlari dan muntah) B : Sekarang, bawa Akbar. F : (tertegun, menelan air ludah) B : (menepuk pundak Farhan) Buatlah keputusan. Bawa Akbar kemari, atau kau berakhir seperti dia (menengok ke arah Alfi). F : (mengangguk pelan dan pergi untuk memanggil Akbar) (selama perjalanan, Farhan membisikkan sesuatu ke Akbar. Sasi menguntit dari belakang) B : Ini dia penyanyi cilik kita…Bernyanyilah untukku. E…\"Kisah Yang Biru\" favoritku. A : (membuka mulut untuk menyanyi, tapi menyodorkan tangan ) 20 ribu. B : (terkejut) A : Aku sudah professional kan? Berarti aku harus dibayar dulu. B : (tertawa) Perampok kecil (memberikan uang) Baiklah, lanjutkan nyanyianmu. (sementara Akbar menyanyi, Farhan yang ditugaskan untuk membiusnya malah menyiramkan alcohol ke wajah anak buah Bridal, kemudian lari diikuti Sasi.) Mereka berlari, lari untuk kedua kalinya. Tempat yang awalnya disebut rumah menjadi tempat eksekusi bagi mereka. Farhan, Akbar dan Sasi berlari menuju gerbong kereta yang masih berjalan lambat, Bridal terus mengejar mereka dan menangkap Sasi yang hampir mencapai gerbong kereta, meninggalkan Farhan dan Akbar yang akan dibawa entah kemana oleh kereta malam itu. 6 tahun berlalu, dibimbing dari satu gerbong ke gerbong kereta lainnya, mereka berhasil mencapai Bandung. Kecewa karena Bibi Riska telah meninggal 2 tahun sebelumnya tanpa mewariskan apa – apa, mereka pun bekerja \"sampingan\" sebagai pemandu pariwisata, selain menjadi penjual sepatu merek Internasional, pengutil turis dan \"pemain drama\" seperti biasanya. A : Welcome to Tangkuban Perahu, Madame. I'm Akbar, your tour guide. Please, Follow me! A : (sambil memandu turis) Tangkuban Perahu exactly was a real huge ship built by Sangkuriang for his mother as a birthday gift. Then, she disappointed with some architecture of the ship and decided to fix it, but she was sucked into it. Mad Sangkurian then left to no where, and the God cursed him and his ship into Tangkuban Perahu because just left his mother without any efforts. Tour : It says nothing about that in guide book. A : Guide book was written by a bunch of lazy good-for-nothing Indonesian beggars (sepasang turis asal Amerika itu pun terbodohi oleh Akbar dan Farhan yang telah \"berlatih\" beberapa bulan ini) Walaupun terpisah jarak dan rentang waktu, Akbar masih mengingat gadis kecil yang pernah mengikuti mereka, Muskeeter ketiga. Dimana dia? Bagaimana perlakuan Bridal terhadapnya? Apakah dia baik – baik saja? Pertanyaan yang terus mengiang di pikirannya membuat tubuh dan hatinya bergerak mencari tahu tentang Gadis dengan senyum terindah itu. Dalam pencariannya, tanpa sengaja ia bertemu dengan seorang teman lama di tepi jalan. Al : (menyanyi, lalu terhenti mendengar langkah kaki di depannya) Kebaikan diberkahi bagi orang – orang yang suka berbagi. A : (mengeluarkan uang 100 dollar) Al : (mencium uang) Ah…dollar. Berapa banyak? A : Seratus. Al : 100 dollar?! Kau mau menipuku, bung. A : Tidak, aku bersumpah atas nama ibuku. Al : Apa yang tergambar disana? Gambar siapa di uang ini? A : (menggaruk – garuk kepala) Seorang pria tua. Bagian atas kepalanya gundul, tapi rambut di sisi kepalanya panjang… Al : (mengangguk lalu menyeletuk) Benjamin Franklin.

Kau sudah menyelamatkan teman – teman yang lain. Aku hanya kurang beruntung. A : Apa Sasi selamat? Al : Dia lebih dari selamat. Sekarang dia di kompleks Herlingga, orang- orang memanggilnya \"Lily\" A : Terima kasih Al : Aku akan menyanyi di pemakamanmu, Akbar! Akbar dan Farhan pun menerobos ke kompleks Herlingga yang terkenal akan warung remang – remangnya, mencari Sasi. Mereka menemukannya sedang berlatih Jaipong di sebuah kamar. A dan F : (menerobos masuk) Sasi! S : (terkejut, menghentikan tariannya) Bagaimana kalian… A : Cepat bereskan pakaianmu! S : (lansung memasukkan pakaiannya ke dalam koper) F : Cepat, jangan lupa ambil uangnya! (menoleh ke pintu) Sialan! B : (menyeringai) Hello, teman lama. Masih ingat aku? (menarik Sasi) Perawan kecil ini sangat bernilai untuk dijual. Berharap bisa mengambilnya? Lebih baik kalian keluar. F : (mengeluarkan pistol) Jangan ada yang bergerak! (semua terkejut) B : Hei, tenanglah, Farhan! F : (menodongkan pistol) Kau diam! Berikan uangmu! B : (senyum licik) Kau bisa mendapatkannya dengan bekerja padaku.

Akbar belum bertemu mereka lagi setelah peristiwa kelam itu. Sekarang, Ia bekerja sebagai Office Boy di salah satu PT. TELKOM Cabang Bandung. Ia belum menyerah untuk mencari gadis yang merebut hatinya. Saat Dephni, teman dekatnya sibuk mengurusi \"tugasnya\" untuk masuk \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\", Akbar mendapat kesempatan untuk mencari Sasi. 26.283 hasil pencarian ia dapat. 15 pencarian untuk Farhan Abdul Jafar. Farhan memintanya untuk bertemu kembali di Jakarta. (Farhan menyambutnya dengan ramah-wajah tanpa dosa- di sebuah calon bangunan) F : Apa kabar, saudaraku? A : (kesal dan memukul Farhan hingga jatuh) Kau masih memanggilku saudara setelah tujuh tahun lalu?! F : Aku tidak meninggalkanmu begitu saja. Aku sudah mengirim pesan… A : Bohong, tidak ada pesan apapun. F : Aku bersumpah aku sudah… A : Tidak ada pesan, TIDAK ADA PESAN! F : (tertegun) (Akbar melampiaskan kemarahannya. Farhan menunggunya tenang untuk bicara. Mereka duduk di tepi bangunan.) F : Kau lihat disana? (menunjuk sebuah daerah kumuh) Itu dulu rumah kita. Dan sekarang kau lihat tempat ini, Akbar? Ini yang dibangun Bridal. Ini Revolusi A : (menatap daerah dibawahnya, sedih) F : Aku berhasil ke Los Angeles. Jakarta sekarang tidak beda jauh dengan disana. A : Apa pekerjaanmu untuknya? F : (mengangkat bahu) Apapun yang ia minta. (beranjak,mengeluarkan kartu nama) Pergilah ke apartemenku. Masih ada beberapa hal yang harus kuurusi disini. A : (menyeletuk sebelum Farhan pergi) Bagaimana dengan Sasi? F : (berbalik, mengangkat sebelah alis) Masih? Sampai sekarang? (menghela napas) Dia sudah lama tiada, dia telah tiada. A : (merenung, tidak mempercayai perkataan Farhan) Farhan bangun lebih pagi, shalat subuh, lalu pergi entah kemana. Akbar tahu pekerjaan kotor apa yang Farhan geluti, berharap dia akan berubah. Keberuntungan berada di pihaknya, dia menemukan alamat rumah Bridal. Rumah Bridal. Akbar berhasil masuk menyamar sebagai tukang cuci piring baru yang disewa Bridal. Sasi terkejut bertemu dengannya saat Akbar diam – diam masuk ke rumah Bridal. S : (mematung) …Akbar… A : (mendekat) Aku menemukanmu. S : (menggelengkan kepalanya) Bagaimana…Bagaimana kau menemukanku? A : (mendekat) Aku tidak menyerah. Ini takdir kita. S : (tersenyum) Terima kasih (jarak mereka semakin dekat, hingga suara klakson mobil terdengar dari luar.) S : (tersadar) Oh, Tuhan. Seharusnya kau tidak disini. A : Akan aku lakukan apapun untuk membebaskanmu. B : (berteriak dari ruang tamu) Lily, bawakan aku sandwich S : Ya, Bridal! (menyiapkan sandwich) Kau akan melakukan apapun untukku? Sekarang, lupakan aku. A : Tidak mungkin, aku menyukaimu. S : (terdiam sejenak) Orang tidak mungkin bertahan hanya dengan cinta, Akbar. (mengantar makanan ke Bridal) (setelah beberapa saat…) S : Sebaiknya kau segera pergi. Bridal tidak mungkin melupakan wajahmu. (mendorong Akbar ke pintu belakang) A : Aku akan menunggumu jam 5 sore di Stasiun Kalideres, setiap hari sampai kau datang. S : (menahan tangis) Selamat tinggal, Akbar (menutup pintu) Begitulah, Akbar setia menunggu di stasiun tua itu, sampai hari ketiga setelah reuni mereka, Sasi akhirnya datang dan mereka bisa melarikan diri bersama. Tapi, Farhan terlebih dulu menahannya, menghancurkan kembali hati Akbar. Kantor Polisi. A : Aku memberi jawaban dari apa yang mereka tanyakan. Dan jawaban itu selalu dari kenangan – kenangan di sekitarku. Y : (mematikan tv) Ini masalah yang rumit dan… A:(menyela) Karena aku rakyat jelata, seorang Office Boy, aku seorang pembohong, kan? Y : Kebanyakan dari kalian seperti itu. Tapi, kau tidak, Tuan Akbar. Kau terlalu jujur. A : (tertegun) Y : Kita selesai.(berjalan pergi) A : (spontan, menghentikan langkah Yohana) Aku tidak tahu mereka membawanya kemana. Sasi…aku pergi ke acara itu berharap dia akan menontonnya.

F : (celingak – celinguk) Akan kuurus si tua itu. Kau harus pergi, tak ada kesempatan lain. S: (berjalan perlahan ke pintu, lalu berbalik) F : Apapun yang sudah kulakukan, maafkan aku. S : (berlari keluar) Sasi tancap gas ke studio RCTI yang jaraknya hanya beberapa kilometer darinya, tersendat oleh kemacetan jalan raya yang disebabkan membludaknya masyarakat menonton Akbar. Sementara itu, Farhan menyiapkan \"bak mandinya\" Di dalam Studio RCTI TV. Fr: Selamat datang di Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. Malam sebelumnya, Akbar Abdul Jafar, seorang OB PT. TELKOM Bandung, berhasil merenggut 500 juta rupiah. Akankah satu pertanyaan tersisa membawanya menjadi milyader…atau mempermalukannya sebagai OB? Apakah kau siap, Akbar? A : Ya. (diiringi teriakan penonton mendukungnya) Tanpa membuang waktu, Sasi berlari menuju studio tempat Akbar berada, menggenggam erat telepon Farhan. Fr: Pertanyaan terakhir. Pertanyaan untuk para kutu buku… A : Aku tidak bisa membaca. Fr: Hm…tidak bagus untukmu. Di buku Alexander Dumas, The ThreeMusketeers, dua Musketeers bernama Athos dan Porthos.

Pertanyaan ini membawanya kembali ketika ia dan kakaknya bersekolah di Tergaman, diajari oleh guru terkasar di dunia dan buku terakhir yang ia diperintahkan untuk membacanya adalah The Three Musketeers. Dia tersenyum. Fr: Aku tebak kau tahu jawabannya. A : Bisa kau percaya? Aku tidak tahu. (sorakan kecewa penonton) Fr: Aku ingatkan Anda, Tuan Hampir Milyader, jika kau melewatkan pertanyaan ini, kau tamat. A : Aku memilih Telepon Teman. Fr: Baik…sambungkan ke jaringan… Sasi hampir mencapainya, hampir mencapainya…ketika telepon digenggamannya terjatuh, baterainya lepas. Ia cepat – cepat memasang dan mengaktifkan kembali telepon itu, firasatnya mengatakan akan ada sesuatu yang terjadi. Sebuah telepon masuk. Fr: Nomor siapa yang kau hubungi? A : Ini nomor kakak laki - lakiku, andai dia… -S- : Halo? Fr: Sepertinya bukan ia yang menjawab.(suara tawa penonton) Kami bicara dengan siapa di sini? -S- : Sasi,Namaku Sasi Kirana Fr: Baiklah, Sasi.

Epilog : Seluruh Indonesia malam itu merayakan kemenangan Akbar, seorang OB rakyat kelas bawah berhasil menciptakan sejarah di sebuah acara tv nan megah.

With every pair of eyes trained on him, every ear perked up, every breathe held in, each person listened in languid anticipation as the ringing went on and on. The tension could be felt in the air - electric, as if a single murmur or word could spark fire in the air; and so every voice was hushed, willing silently for the phone to answer. Finally, the ringing stopped, and a female voice was heard. The audience collectively exhaled, and each of them wished - an inevitable action in situations like this - that the chai wallah sitting there in front of them has just landed himself the answer to the question that could bring him 20 million rupees, the answer to who the third musketeer was. Every soul that peered at Jamal - from the very seats around him, from dusty television sets in dingy rooms, or from simply hearing from a radio - wanted him to win; yearned for it. That a simple chai wallah raised in poverty could win such an amount, that a seemingly insignificant man could rise above known barriers and snag what always seemed an impossibility to acquire, it awakened unrealized ambitions in the hearts of many of his onlookers, people much like him - it filled them with joy, hope, an inspiration to be more than mediocre. If he won, a statement would be made. And each grazed and wounded heart in India wanted it to be so, it was almost something that needed to be; these hearts raised in hardship and in resilience needed another hero - a hero that touched hearts so subtly that his onlookers were almost unaware. It would simply break their hearts if ever they were to see the look of pure loss on their almost-to-be-hero, if ever Jamal were to get the last answer wrong. But the audience didn't know that that look of pure loss was now a lifetime away - it was an impossibility now as Jamal felt all his burdens fly away from his shoulders. She's alive. It's her voice he hears, the voice he's longed to hear for such a long time. Everything was alright again, his chest was again filling with the warmest of feelings he's ever felt. He feels a grin growing on his face; he could hear the happiness in his voice as he recites to her the question, not really expecting an answer. He could hear her, too, her voice laced with a smile as she answers with a simple \"I don't know,\" And the line is cut, Latika never gets to finish her words. And she doesn't have to. Almost - Jamal almost hears the promise in her tone; that this wasn't the last time he'll get to hear her voice, that they were to meet again. Jamal didn't know how he knew, he just did - just as he knew he loved her that first time he saw her: he didn't know why, he just did. Jamal threw all caution to the wind, and answered whichever answer he fancied; he gave a nonchalant shrug as he uttered the foreign name. All he knew was that the real name of the third musketeer was Latika, and that he'd already won the prize he'd been longing for all his life. Anything else that came along with that was an added benefit, a welcome respite - but so long as he had her, he knew that he could breeze through any toil and trial life put in his way. With her, Jamal could do the impossible - and, he just did. Author's notes: Hope you liked it! ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Slumdog Millionaire.

With my eyes closed. That scared girl once again. But remembering the sweetness of his kiss, I drew myself up on my toes, pulled his ear to my lips and breathed the words like they were the air I needed to survive – saying what I should have told him back in that doorway at Javed's house – I love you. I've always loved you. Then back to gravity I buried my face in his chest. I breathed again. ************* I remember everything about that night: The hot sticky air of the train station; watching him cross the tracks, his eyes never leaving mine; the chill that ran through my body feeling his touch on my skin. How easily his hand fit mine. How safe, how whole I felt with his arm around my shoulders. He was scared. Afraid Javed's men would come looking for us. So he took me to the police station, where I wouldn't find out until much later he had spent so many torturous hours. He only wanted to protect me. But they wanted to take me away. Send me to a safe house outside the city. I shook my head and clutched his arm tighter. He was high profile now they said, a target, the slum kid with all the money. It wasn't safe for me to be with him. I stood my ground. Jamal looked at me, no doubt remembering the stubborn girl I had always been, and gave in. We left the same we had come, together. We walked towards the airport. I didn't care where he took me. I rested my head on his shoulder and sighed with contentment. He could have led me straight into a burning building and I wouldn't have flinched much less lifted my head. I knew he didn't want to take me to Juhu, to his slum, to his home of corrugated tin that lay beneath the noisy runaway and I sensed a change come over him as we got closer. Despite my attempts to reassure him, gently squeezing his hand, nuzzling even closer, I felt him tense beneath me. As if he thought any moment I could bolt, run away, flee at the first sight of trash littered streets or needy children loitering by the side of the road. But run to what? Back to a man who beat me? Back to a life cowering fear, wondering where the next blow would come from. Would it be a black eye or a bloody lip today? Back to a life as someone else's possession. Back to a life filled with all the comforts a girl could want – a pampered life – but no one to share it with, no one to talk to, no to unburden my secrets to, no one to hold, no one to look at me, the way he was looking at me now – full of love. We entered the house. He dropped my hand and walked away from me. I stood in the doorway watching his back. His shame hidden from view. \"Jamal,\" I whispered. He froze and turned to face me. Panic in his eyes. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, his eyes darting to the floor. \"I don't have… I mean I don't have much…\" I walked to him. It was my turn to become the rescuer. Slowly, deliberately, I wrapped my arms around his waist and drew his body flush against mine, wanting him to feel it, the full meaning behind each touch, absorb each contact a sign of my devotion. I gently placed my head on his chest, resting it there as if it were a pillow, meant just for me. His heartbeat the soundtrack for the rest of my life. He hesitated, but then embraced me. His lanky arms enfolding me like a soft blanket, sweeping me up into a place I could curl up inside of, into a home I never had. We stood in silence. I held him tighter letting the moment stretch out into minutes. I needed him to know what I didn't have the words to say. He was enough. He was more than enough. I didn't need a big house. I didn't need a five-star bed or designer clothes and a walk-in closet to put them in. I needed him. And had he guessed wrong, had he never made it to the twenty million rupee question, had living the rest of our lives in Juhu, been our destiny that would have been enough too. My final answer: kiss me. I was the girl in the dirty yellow dress. I was the rebel, the fighter, the girl who grew up right here in this slum, beneath these same tin roofs. I broke our embrace and looked up into his eyes, forcing him to see that girl standing in front of him. He shifted uncomfortably. \"I don't have anything for you to wear,\" he said. I saw one of his t-shirt's lying in the corner. \"This will do,\" and picked it up. \"Turn around now. No looking.\" Even with his back to me I could feel him smile at the memory: Pure-hearted Jamal, the perfect gentleman even then, refusing to peak when he handed me a towel. I smiled to. \"You're a good man Jamal,\" I said. And it was true; the sweet boy had become a man, a man I feared too good for me. I stripped off my jeans and shirt and slipped his t-shirt on. It smelled like him as I pulled it over my head. I breathed in deeply. He turned around. I blushed suddenly aware of his eyes studying me, although I knew even then it would be something I'd never tire of: watching him, watch me. I sat down on his bed and patted the spot next to me. He smiled and came, knowing to protest was futile. I needed him next to me: Tonight. Incessantly. Always. Eternally. He stripped down to his undershirt and boxers and climbed in. We laid on our backs, side by side in the darkness, air rising from our chests in unison. Then suddenly, without warning, the flood came. All it took was his arm brushing up against mine. Like the strike of a match its friction ignited my violent rush of tears, coming up from some reservoir, some deep well buried inside. One touch in the dark and I lost control, all my strength escaped. He sat up and pulled me to him, supporting my weight against his body, cradling me in his arms as if I were a helpless child. I was. I clung to him, soaking us both. All my life I had been indifferent towards love. It wasn't necessary. It wasn't food or shelter or clothing. I could survive without. And I had. For the longest time, but now… now love was holding me. Now love had gone and tracked me down, scaled every obstacle between us and brought me here, into this bed, skin on skin, the scar on my cheek pressed safely against the soft fabric of his shirt. My tears were for the bitter misfortune of every moment we had been separated. My tears were for knowing because he dared to love me this much, because he went and made me the luckiest damn girl in the world, we never would have to be again. It's hard to explain the words we spoke in our silence that night. How the minutes turned into hours and still the tears refused to yield. How his arms began to mold to the shape of my body, as if they were meant to be a part of me, another appendage, something I could never shed. He knew it was pain I needed to release, years of hurt finally departing my body in waves of grief; a wall of tears he had no hope to stop, or even slow, rather shelter he could provide. His kissed the top of my head. He rocked me gently. I stayed head down, tucked in the refuge of his arms. He was my life raft, the only thing that could pull me to dry land. I held on tighter. It was the first night of the rest of our lives. It ended in exhaustion: emotional, physical, tears run dry, asleep in each other's arms. In the morning, I awoke to my dreams, staring into his eyes.

Rating: PG. Genre: TEH MOOSH. Might be the sappiest thing I've ever written. But come on, y'all know you love it... Pairings: Jamal/Latika. Disclaimer: I don't own Slumdog Millionaire , a bunch of folks who are a lot cooler and have a lot more money than I do own it... Warnings: Spoilers all over for the movie, especially the ending. Summary: She often tells him it's a good thing that he went on Millionaire when he did, because God-- whichever God there is-- made him good at one game, and one game only, and he'd found just the one. . . She often tells him it's a good thing that he went on Millionaire when he did, because God-- whichever God there is-- made him good at one game, and one game only , and he'd found just the one. Of course, her tone is teasing, as she says this when she's absolutely creaming him in a match of Scrabble. And how unfair it is, he thinks, that she's so good at this particular board game; considering they're both uneducated non-native speakers, her English should be just as bad as his, if not worse (he may not have passed as Sean Connery's neighbour, but he likes to think his admittedly limited international experience, aka the Call Center days, give him an edge). In fact, he half suspects her to be cheating, but he doesn't care; the glow in her eyes when she puts down some word he's never even heard before draws him in, and the curve of her lips as they draw a teasing smirk makes him want to kiss her. He'll let her have this victory, so long as it makes her happy. After all, she does have a point (he is absolutely horrible at almost every other game either of them can think of) and while he does consider himself the luckiest man alive, it's got nothing to do with the 20 million rupees he won on the show. She bites her lower lip as she thinks of her next word. He loves her... so much. He never gave a thought to whether his feelings for her would change when they were finally together. He'd spent what felt like a lifetime with no other goal in his life but to find her; one would think things would be completely different once that goal was achieved... And things are different, in a sense. They are now living in a quiet little city near the east coast of Britain. It isn't a small town, nor is it a big metropolis. It is small enough that some people still stare as they walk by, wondering why this pretty indian girl likes wearing yellow so much; but at the same time it is big enough that these people eventually learn to ignore their particularities. They live in an inexpensive flat near the center of the city. It isn't all that big-- he wouldn't know what to do with a big house anymore than he knows what to do with all the money he now has. But it is comfortable, and it is home. Their home. She is taking acting classes. It is an uphill climb, but she has nothing but drive. At times she doubts herself, it is inevitable. But he believes in her; her scar, her accent, the fact that she is a minority, or whatever it is she is fretting about at the moment... those are all things that can be overcome, he tells her. And if her audience loves her even a fraction of how he loves her, she will be the brightest star in the marquesine. His determined words never fail to make her smile. As for him, he is working at a quaint little caf just a few blocks away from their flat. He's not serving tea anymore (although he does offer to wait tables every once in a while, to help any of his coworkers that can't make it to their shift). Instead, he's the assistant to the general manager. It's not the most amazing job, but it's more than he ever thought he would have. Other than for plane tickets and those first few days of having to stay in hotel rooms, he has not touched his prize money. They don't need it, and she hasn't asked him to use it. Perhaps they will some day (he wants to take her to so many places), but for now, what they have is enough. Love is enough. So yes, things had changed in his life. But not when it comes to his feelings. She is his destiny, forever-- he is as sure of that now as he had been so many years ago, on a dark train wagon after she had been left behind. She is still the center of his life, perhaps even more than she was before. Because now he can be with her, and hold her, and hear her laugh wholeheartedly during their improvised \"board game Sundays.\" And when it feels like he can't love her any more than he already does, the next day comes and he wakes up to see her beautiful face beside his, her arms wrapped around his waist as she unconsciously snuggles closer to him, and there it is... he loves her. So much that it amazes him, because the feeling never fades away; it just grows. And he is so happy, just there, right there, that he wouldn't trade this for all the millions in the world. After she is done putting down the letters on the board, she notices he's staring at her, apparently lost in thought. She amusedly chucks one of her remaining tiles at his head, which effectively draws him out of his reverie. Then she smiles brightly at him, leans in and gives him a kiss, because she knows him, and she knows where his mind has wandered, and she loves him for it. So he's awful at all sorts of games. It doesn't matter. He's got her now, and he doesn't have to do it alone. Together they'll win the world. ","Summary":" Board Game Sundays Author: Carla, aka cali-chan. Rating: PG. Genre: TEH MOOSH.

These characters are so intense on their own, it's hard to manage them!!! But anyway, this takes place a year after the end of the movie, and is based on one of my favorite scenes from the movie where little Jamal and Latika are talking about their future. I hope you all like it!! Also, it was posted really quick, and hasn't been edited yet, so please forgive any spelling/grammar mistakes. If you show me where they are, I will fix them. thanks! \"Where are you taking me?\" The note of fear in my voice was forced and false. I felt the heat from his hand in mine, and that was enough to banish any doubts. \"I won't ruin the surprise.\" He said, and still, his voice sent thrills of excitement down my spine. It was hard to believe, even after a year, that we were together. I groaned, keeping up the charade of irritation. \"Jamal, this is no way to treat a woman!\" I berated him, opening my eyes to try and squint through my yellow scarf now tied as a blindfold. \"You won't care in a few moments.\" He said, and suddenly his arms were around my waist, guiding me to him. I felt his lips brush the top of my head, felt him inhale deeply, and I felt his slight panic. It was too good to believe that we hadn't been bothered by anything in over year since Salim's death. Jamal had been afraid that Javed's men would look to us for revenge, but he had been wrong so far. No one came looking for us but the reporters, still impressed by the boy chaiwallah and what he had achieved. \"I'm not going anywhere.\" I told him, at I felt him relax at my words. \"That's a promise?\" He asked. I nodded, reaching up blindly. His hand captured mine, and his soft lips brushed my fingertips before he spoke again, this time his smile evident in his tone. \"Come on.\" He pulled me forward, and we were walking again. \"Okay, stop now.\" I froze, and I heard his quiet footfalls as he moved behind me, turning me a little to the right. He positioned me, and then let go. \"Okay, now look.\" I reached back and untied the clumsy knot, blinding myself with the bright sun. \"Jamal, what…?\" The question died on my lips as I looked up at a house. What struck me first was the sheer size. There were two stories, and I could clearly see at least three front rooms from where I stood. The white trim commanded my attention next, and then I noticed the subtle yellow tinge of the sides. There was a terrace to the side, and large windows that glinted in the bright sun. \"Jamal…it's a house.\" I said, my eyes still scanning the building. I was in awe. It was straight from my dream, exactly the house I had pictured nearly twelve years ago, when Jamal had first talked about us growing up together. My eyes widened as the memory hit me, Jamal's young sweet voice filling my ears. \" We'll live in a big house on Harbour Road. You, me and Salim: the three musketeers.\" I looked to the end of the street as I finished putting the pieces together, not at all surprised that the street sign declared that we were on Harbour Road. The bright red \"SOLD\" sign screamed at me suddenly as I looked back to the house, and by the time I turned around to face Jamal, I had tears in my eyes. \"You remembered.\" I said. He was by my side in an instant, worry creasing his features. I shook my head, trying to convey that the tears weren't bad. I was happy. \"Even when I forgot, you remembered.\" He shrugged, his face relaxing only slightly. \"It's what I do.\" He explained simply. Suddenly his hand was in mine, but I was surprised by the sharp bite of metal. I looked down, and trapped between our cupped hands was a set of keys. \"Do you want to see the inside?\" \"The inside?\" I had forgotten that there even was an inside. I was still stuck on this being the house of our dreams. \"Of course.\" He smiled, leading me up the short walkway and to the front door. He slid the key into the lock, and with the slightest turn of his hand, the door swung open. He led me from room to room, explaining what he thought we would do with it. As the shock wore off, I began adding my ideas, and before we were even done with the first floor I was already considering it my home. \"It's beautiful.\" I sighed, leaning against the railing to the staircase. \"You're sure you love it?\" He asked, pulling me back into his arms. I kept my face to his chest for a moment, then looked up at his expectant eyes. \"Yes.\" ","Summary":" Okay, so this is my first attempt ever at Slumdog fanfiction, and probably my last.

It takes place a couple months before Jamal reunites with Latika and goes on the game show. I tried to make it as accurate as possible. Overall, it's a JamalOC story but it's got JamalLatika as well. I own nothing but my OC, Tanvi (I got the name from the girl who played teenage Latika). I wish I owned Dev Patel. :stares off into space dreamily: Anyways, enjoy and please review. It was nearly three in the morning when Tanvi woke to the sound of a tea kettle whistling. Normally, she wouldn't think anything of it. She kept the bedroom window open at night because of the heat and usually would assume it was one of her neighbors. But that night was different. She noticed, through heavy eyes, that the spot next to her was unusually empty. She sat up, knowing that wasn't how things had been when she'd fallen asleep. Her boyfriend had been stretched out next to her when she'd drifted off that night. She listened more carefully to the sound of the whistling tea kettle, realizing that the noise was in her home. Climbing off the bed, she slipped into her robe and made her way to the kitchen. She found him sitting at the small table in the kitchen with a fresh cup of tea in front of him. He seemed to be staring into the light brown liquid, lost in thought. The newspaper on the table rustled from the small breeze blowing through the room. Pushing her hair back, she walked up behind him and gently placed her hands on his bare shoulders. \"Usually a man gets up in the middle of the night for something much stronger than tea.\" Jamal turned in his seat, surprised by the sudden voice in his ear. He looked up at Tanvi with some concern in his eyes. \"Did I wake you?\" \"You did,\" she replied, brushing her lips briefly against his with a smile. He smiled back at her, squeezing the hand on his shoulder. \"But it's alright. This is better than sleeping alone.\" Going over to the counter, she poured herself a cup of tea before sitting down across from him. She sipped at the hot liquid, tentatively, as she pulled her legs up onto the chair. \"I still don't understand how you can work with this all day and then want to drink when you come home.\" Jamal smiled lightly but said nothing, still staring into his tea. Tanvi watched him with interest as he sipped his own drink. Feeling her gaze on him, he finally met her eyes with question. \"What is it?\" \"Nothing. It's nothing.\" If he was curious, he didn't press any further. The room was quiet for a moment except for the cars passing outside. Breaking the silence, she said, \"I spoke with my mother today. She was hoping that we would come for dinner this weekend. I told her I would talk to you about it first.\" He nodded and made a noncommittal sound but didn't react much other than that. She waited for him to give more of a response to the idea but he didn't say anything. He simply continued staring into his tea. \"My parents would really like to meet you. I've told them all about you. Their curious about the man I've been living with for the past five months.\" \"When do they want us to come?\" he asked after a moment's deliberation. \"This Saturday. My brothers are going to be home from the university so they want it to be a family dinner.\" \"Are you sure they want me to come if it's family meal?\" \"Of course. It's my mother's way of welcoming you into the family. When Viraj brought his girlfriend, Priya, home for the first time, our mother acted like it was the Queen of England coming to dinner. I swear the woman tends to overreact.\" \"If you're sure, then we'll go.\" Tanvi smiled brightly when he said this and leaned across the table, kissing him swiftly. \"Mum will be so happy. She's been dying to meet you.\" Jamal didn't say anything as he finished his tea. Standing up from the table, he took his cup to the sink before coming back to her. Taking her hand, he said, \"Come on. Let's go back to bed.\" She allowed him to lead her back to their room, leaving the dishes to be dealt with later. Slipping off her robe, she slid back into the bed and curled up next to Jamal. He slid an arm around her and held her close as he stared up at the ceiling. He seemed to have gone back to thinking about whatever it was that had been on his mind when he first got up. Tanvi looked at him in curiosity. \"Who are you thinking about?\" He looked at her in confusion. \"What do you mean?\" \"You seem to be thinking about something important so I just assumed it was about someone.\" Jamal didn't answer, just looked back at the ceiling. \"Is it about Salim?\" \"No,\" he said unemotionally. \"I try not to think about Salim.\" \"Then who is it?\" Jamal was silent again as Tanvi looked at him in a different way. \"Is it a woman?\" He looked at anything other than her but that was enough for her. She pulled out of his arms, sitting up on the bed. She looked at him with cold eyes. Softly, she asked, \"Who is she?\" \"No one,\" he told her, staring at the ceiling again. \"Jamal, who is she?\" Her expression was blank but her voice wavered a bit as she tried to keep her composure. \"Someone I knew a long time ago,\" he said as he sat up as well and looked at her. \"What's her name?\" she asked, her eyes fixed on his. \"Latika,\" he told her, the name coming to him as easy as his own. Tanvi didn't say anything, simply pushing her hair back. Deciding to continue, he said, \"I've known her since I was a child. She was one of the children who worked for Maman. I haven't seen her since I was thirteen. She stayed with Salim when I left.\" She stared at her hands, not saying anything at first. Then with some difficulty, she asked, \"Do you love her?\" \"Tanvi…\" \"Do you love her? Or, did you?\" At first, he wasn't sure how to respond to the question. The last thing he wanted was to upset her. He could see the tears fighting to break free and he felt terrible that he was causing this but he knew that she would be more upset if he lied to her. \"I did love her. I made Salim come back to Mumbai so we could find her. She was my best friend.\" \"Do you still love her?\" \"Tanvi, I haven't seen her in years. I don't even know if she's alive.\" \"That's not an answer.\" \"A piece of me does. She was the first girl I ever loved. I'll always remember that.\" Jamal took her by the arm and pulled her closer to him. He cupped her face and looked into her eyes. \"But now I love you. I still think of Latika sometimes. I wonder what has happened to her the same way that I wonder about Salim.\" Tanvi took his hands and held them in her own. \"Jamal, you love her more than you admit. I'm not naïve. I can see it in your eyes. If you knew where she was, you'd be with her not with me. She's your first love and those don't always fade with time. If you ever do find Latika, I don't think you'll want me more than you want her.\" \"Don't say that,\" Jamal told her. \"It's been years since I've seen her. I've been with you for half a year. I would never leave you like that. I don't want to lose you.\" \"And I don't want to lose you either. But I don't want to have to fight for your affection with a girl who is not even around.\" \"You don't have to. Latika is my past. You are my future. You are the one that I am with.\" He pulled her into his arms, brushing his lips to hers sweetly. He brushed the few tears that had slid down her cheeks away and kissed her forehead. Finally, he said, \"We should get some sleep. Both of us do have to go to work soon.\" Jamal lay back on the bed, pulling Tanvi down with him. He wrapped both his arms around her and held her tight. Soon, his breathing evened out and she could hear him snoring lightly next to her. She was beginning to drift back off to sleep, having more trouble as she thought about everything. She knew that he loved her and she knew he was being honest with her. But she knew that he would never love her as much as he loved Latika. She would always be the other woman.

Great, I thought to myself, more people to compete with. There were already so many interns that I was beginning to get nervous about my chances of getting a job here. Google was such an amazing place to work, from what little I'd seen of the place I could already tell that this was somewhere I could see myself work here, this was somewhere I could really grow as a programmer. I looked down in annoyance at the stupid multicoloured hat I'd been given, shoving it into my bag and making my way through the unrelenting crowd. My stomach rumbled, reminding me that I hadn't eaten breakfast this morning due to nerves. I stretched onto my tiptoes to see where I could find food and wasn't disappointed when I saw a cafe. I started off in that direction and quickly got into line behind some old guy. He was nervously bouncing from foot to foot as he glanced around, he caught my eye and attempted to give me a smile. I decided to be nice for once and smiled back. Unfortunately he took this as an invitation to start talking to me. \"There's a lot of people here, huh?\" I tutted and looked behind me, feeling irritated as I decided there was no way I could get out of this without leaving the line, and there was no way I could do that without my stomach ache rumbling throughout the rest of the day. I sucked in a breath through my teeth before turning back to him. \"Yeah, well it is Google.\" I drawled, nodding my head slowly and awkwardly, feeling more and more irritated the longer this guy looked at me. He chuckled and nodded, rubbing the back of his head. \"It sure is, listen do you-\" Thankfully whatever he was about to ask me was interrupted by the cashier calling for the next in line, which happened to be him. He smiled apologetically before going up to the counter. From this point I decided to ignore him and reached for my phone that was in my back pocket, a bad habit I had but couldn't break. Trust me, I'd tried but my phone always seemed to make its way back there. It's like I had a magnet on my ass. Unlocking the screen I decided to snap a picture and post it on Facebook and twitter to make my limited number of friends and followers jealous. First day at Google, not too shabby. I would have come up with something better but the old guy had finished clearing out the cafe and was walking away with his arms full of food and drink, I shook my head in amusement and walked forward to order a bagel and tea. I fumbled with my bag in an attempt to find my purse. \"Don't worry love, I've got it.\" A British voice came out of nowhere, making me look up from my bag. A boy was standing in front of me, smirking. It had clearly been him speaking but from one look I knew he wasn't someone I wanted to be friends with. Something about the way he was looking at me made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. I was about to deny him when he cashier called over to to in an exasperated voice. \"It's free!\" I raised an eyebrow in surprise, clearly someone had been saying those words all day but I wasn't complaining, I reached past the British boy to grab sugars, a small pot of milk and a stirrer stick. As I pulled back I noticed that the boy had closed his eyes, I pursed my lips in slight disgust as I noticed he was taking deep breaths through his nose. \"Did you just-\" I began incredulously. His eyes slammed open. \"No! No! I wasn't doing anything.\" He raised his hands, maybe to touch me but I didnt stick around to find out. \"Come back!\" I rolled my eyes and hurried through the door, trying to get as far away from the creep as possible. I found myself walking back into the foyer not entirely sure of where I was supposed to be going. Finally however I figured out the way to a room where a lot of interns were, checking my phone for the timetable and making sure I was actually in the right place. I stood on my tiptoes once again to try and find a seat there weren't very many places left. I had a choice of the old guy from earlier, some really fat kid, a guy who was compulsively texting and a small blonde girl who was biting her nails. I had stood there for too long and someone had sat next to the blonde so I made my way over to the guy who was texting. He didn't even look up as I sat down and that suited me just fine. Since I was sat at the edge of the row I had a better opportunity to see the rest of the interns, twisting to see those behind me I quickly regretted it as I saw the creepy guy from earlier was making his way down to where I sat. I sighed and buried my head in my hands. \"Oh crap.\" Phone bow glanced over at me with a frown, twisting in his seat to see what was happening before snorting under his breath. I sneered at him. \"Shut up.\" I hissed at him, feeling an immediate rush of hatred towards him and the creep who was steadily moving towards me. I thought about making a run for it but it was too late at this point. I was resigned to my fate. \"Hi again.\" I rolled my eyes at the British voice and pretended I couldn't hear him. \"Excuse me. Hello?\" I jumped when I felt a tap on my shoulder and reluctantly took my eyes off of phone boy's smirk before turning to the creep. He smiled innocently at me and leant his hand on the back of my chair, which brought him into closer contact then I would have liked. I suddenly regretted wearing this dress as I could have sworn I saw him trying to get a look down it, I shifted uncomfortably under the weight of his stare. Finally I cracked. \"Can I help you with something?\" I asked irritably. He grinned wider, the glare from his teeth practically hitting me in the eye. \"I'm sure you could.\" He murmured, l scoffed and pushed him away. \"Whatever you're thinking its not happening.\" I smiled sweetly at him before turning my attention to the guy next to me. \"Would you mind switching places with me?\" He took his attention from his phone and sighed, obviously as irritated by me as I was by this creep. Before he could reply the creep caught my attention again, making me miss the way phone boy was glancing appreciatively at my legs and chest before heading back to his phone and typing a bit more frantically than before. \"Listen I'm sorry, can we start over? I think we got off on the wrong foot.\" He smiled again but I was done listening to him. \"No thanks. Can you go back to your seat please and dont talk to me again.\" It may have seemed a bit harsh but I wasn't one to give second chances, his creepiness wasn't going to fade and I wasn't here to make friends or anything else. Plus my instincts were usually right and they were screaming at me o get away from this guy. Phone guy snorted again, this time loud enough for both me and the creep to hear. Creep turned to him and sneered. \"I would have thought a loser like you had other things to do than eavesdrop on private conversations.\" I blinked in extreme irritation.\"This isn't a private conversation, this is a rejection. Now go back to your seat.\" I hissed. This guy just wasn't taking a hint. He narrowed his eyes at me and leant closer, making me hit the back of my head on the chair and groan in annoyance and slight pain as I tried to move my face away from his. \"The names Graham sweetheart. Make sure you remember it.\" And with that the creep finally decided to leave me in peace. I rubbed the back of my head with a frown and slumped down in my chair, pulling the bottom of my dress down a bit more as I did so. \"I'll remember it when I file for a restraining order.\" I muttered. Phone boy glanced over at me again and seemed about to say something when everyone's attention was drawn to the front of the room. An Indian man stood in front of us, scanning our faces and seemingly looking for something inspiring. I don't think he found it from his unimpressed facial expression. \"I am Roger Chetty.\" He introduced himself, hands behind his back as he paced up and down. \"I am head of the Google Intern Program. Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship, oh no. You will do what we do, and we will watch how well you do it. Now, you represent the finest schools, your intelligence and achievement is well noted.\" Mr Chetty's eyes scanned over us again and when his eyes met mine I gulped. \"But to excel as this internship you're going to need far more than brain power. What you're going to need Googilness.\" Everyone chuckled at this except it seems, me and phone boy who was still periodically checking his phone, I smiled when I saw he got a text from his mother. I looked back to the front before he saw me looking. Chetty's face was unamused at the chuckles. \"Nothing funny. Googilness. The intangible stuff that made a search engine into an engine for change. Now you'll be divided into teams and by the end of the summer only one team will be guaranteed a full-time position. The other 95% of you... Will not.\" He smiled grimly. \"Now you've been split into several seminars to acquaint you with our campus and culture. Seminar descriptions have been emailed to each of you. I would wish you luck, but it's not luck that you need. Get to work.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter Two There was an immediate rush as everyone decided it was a good idea to get up and try to leave the room at the same time. Obviously there ended up being a massive queue for the door so I, being quite close to the front of the room, was near the back of the queue, instead of getting annoyed at this fact I counted my blessings when I saw that Graham was stuck in the middle of an obese guy and what appeared to be a non-stop talker in the form of a small brunette female. I laughed under my breath even though I was in a similar situation, although I didn't mind being pressed right up against phone boy's chest. He smirked down at me, quickly getting distracted as his phone buzzed. I rolled my eyes as I caught sight of the text he was replying to. To: Stuart From: Austin Hey man, any fit girls at Google? Cause you know you owe me for that thing with Steve... To: Austin From: Stuart You would die if you were in my situation right now, this one is definitely too hot for you man. Gonna try for myself. I hoped to God he was talking about the girl behind me who was compulsively biting her fingernails. Still, I thought with a sigh and a glance towards Graham, it was better than the alternatives. Slowly, oh so slowly, we inched forwards as the people in front managed to squeeze their way through the door, however due to the amount of people that were behind me meant that I was still in a close proximity to phone boy, whose name, according to his texts was Stuart. Not the name I would have thought for him. I frowned as one of his elbows dug into my back as he got another text, after a few more painful minutes later where his elbow continued to give me the most painful massage ever I'd had enough. Twisting around was difficult but I managed it, giving Stuart an annoyed look as I pushed his arm away from my back. \"Do you mind?\" I hissed over the rabble of voices as we still inched forwards. He didn't seem to notice that I was talking to him and I looked over to see what he was texting, pursing my lips in anger as I saw he had taken a picture of my bottom and was sending it to his friend. I snatched the phone away from him, scowling furiously as I tapped out my own message on his phone. To: Mom From: Stuart Hello Stuart's mother, your son was just caught sending this picture of me to one of his friends, I hope you understand why he comes home without the ability to reproduce. [Image sent ] And with that I pressed send, shoving the phone back at him and ignored his shocked blinking, his mouth opening and closing without saying a word. \"Do you have anything to say for yourself? Because right now you're on the same level of creepiness as Graham.\" I spoke in a furious whisper, my knee was itching to connect with a certain body part. \"I heard my name.\" I scoffed in annoyance as of course this would happen, Graham smirked at Stuart before trying to wrap an arm around my waist. \"I knew you couldn't resist me.\" I sneered before realised I was at the front of the queue and hurriedly tried to put as much distance between me and those two creeps as possible. Graham was nothing if not persistent however. \"Yes, because I said your name that must mean I'm madly in love with you.\" I pushed his face away and scowled again. \"Get away from me weirdo.\" Luckily for the other guy, Graham took my mind of my plan to kick him in the balls, and actually made me forget what he'd done in the first place. I had to duck into a random building and into an empty room to get him off my tail. I let out a sigh, finding myself growing increasingly annoyed at the situation I was finding myself in. Why did I have to meet Graham? I must have done something in a former life to get this sort of punishment. I just didn't know what it was. I opened my eyes, unsure of when I'd closed them and looked at the room I'd managed to stumble into. At first glance it seemed like a normal office but if you looked a little closer you could see the small touches that showed it's occupant was slightly if not completely crazy. There was a rubix cube tower in the corner, suspended above it was a model helicopter that's blades spun lazily, threatening to fall with every turn. I grimaced at the state of the desk, taking my eyes away from the mess quickly before I had the urge to go over and clean it. What caught my attention the most however, was a pair of seemingly innocent glasses that were perched on a separate desk. I frowned as I peered at them, noticing that there was something different about them but not sure what. \"Google glasses.\" I heard from behind me, sending me into a state of panic at being caught somewhere I shouldn't be. The man who had spoken was scruffy looking, with a beard and headphones around his neck, he was not smiling which made me feel more uncomfortable than I was. \"What?\" I asked, avoiding eye contact with him. He sighed before walking past me and over to the glasses picking them up and holding them to his face to peer through one of the lenses. \"These are Google glasses. The first prototype that I was entrusted with.\" I nodded pretending that I knew what he was talking about. \"And what do Google glasses do?\" He tilted his head, looking at me with an expression of interest. \"What do any glasses do?\" I let out an uncomfortable laugh. \"Fair enough. I'll just get out of your office.\" I motioned with my thumb the doorway behind me and smiled again at the strange man before taking my leave. \"It isn't my office.\" I heard from behind me. I turned around again when I reached the doorway. \"Oh. Well I'm probably late for something anyway.\" I blinked when I realised this was probably true and reached into my jean pocket to fish out my phone and quickly looked for the email that held my schedule. \"Oh man! Can you tell me where this room is?\" I held the phone up for him to take, waiting for him to do something. He took the phone from me and pursed his lips, nodding gently at me before giving the phone back and walking past me through the door. \"Hurry, we have five minutes.\" I winced and scampered after him. He led the way through the building, thankfully I'd managed to choose one that was quite close to where I needed to be, Headphones stopped in front of one of the other rooms and nodded at the door. \"Thank you, I owe you one.\" He waved off my gratitude and walked away. I stared incredulously at his back before shaking my head and opening the door. Thankfully I actually had managed to be on time so there were still seats for me to choose from. Even better was the fact that Graham wasn't in here. I smiled and sat in one of the seats in the middle, not paying attention to anyone I was near or I would have noticed the guy who had been in front of me at the cafe wave to me. I sat just in front of them, taking my phone out of my back pocket just before I did so. I heard whispering behind me and because I had a few minutes before the class was going to start I eavesdropped. \"Dude who were you waving to? I didn't know you'd made any friends?\" The voice had a distinct southern drawl that I was sure to remember. \"Well we aren't friends per say, acquaintances at best, I mean, I don't know her name but I'm sure we could be really good friends and that's something I'm looking forward to.\" I recognised the voice and kept myself from sighing, I really hope he wasn't talking about me. I stretched my feet in front of me before folding them in an attempt to be somewhat ladylike. A voice sounded from the seat next to me, making me jump in surprise as I hadn't noticed someone else sit down. \"Hey, about earlier,\" I turned to see phone boy had decided to sit next to me, his phone sat on his lap and his stupid beanie on his head. \"I'm not, you know, a creep or anything.\" I raised an eyebrow and leant closer to him, noticing him gulp as I did so. \"You know,\" I drawled. \"People who have to say they arent creeps, are usually creeps.\" I backed away from him as Mr Chetty walked into the room. \"Did you see that?\" I heard the southern guy whisper behind me. \"That was some serious sexual tension, I can feel it from here.\" I cast an annoyed scowl behind me as Mr Chetty clapped his hands to get our attention, causing me to cast my eyes back to the front. Stuart seemed to have heard what they said as well as instead of listening to Mr Chetty he turned his attention to his phone, his ears burning under his beanie.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three \"Hello and welcome to your first seminar, you should find on the floor under your seat two paddles.\" Mr Chetty held up his own as everyone reached under their seats. I shifted forwards until I was able to bend over to reach under my own seat, making awkward eye contact with Stuart as I did so. I rolled my eyes and sat back up, the two paddles safely in my hands. \"You should find one is red and the other is green, please raise your hand if you do not have the two colours.\" No one raised their hands so Mr Chetty nodded in satisfaction before pressing a button on the remote he held in his hand which started the presentation, the words WORKPLACE SEMINAR emblazoned on the first page. \"Now I recognise that Google is not the most convention workplace.\" I withheld a snort. \"Having said that, we have rules. I am going to ask you a series of questions, you're going to raise the green paddle to indicate yes and the red paddle to indicate no. So let's begin.\" He moved from the centre to the side as he clicked the button again and the next page came up. \"Having a beer with your boss?\" He read, immediately my hand with the red paddle shot up. I straightened my back as he looked over at me but apparently it wasn't me he was looking at. It was the two older men behind me. I didn't have to look around to know they were the only two who had gotten the question wrong. I cast a side glance at Stuart to find he was looking as bored as I felt, his phone was on his lap which meant that even he wasn't stupid enough to incur the wrath of Mr Chetty, something I was sure was something to be feared. \"Some of you are under 21.\" Mr Chetty continued, seemingly not going to tell the two men they were wrong or at least he was trying to ignore them. I rolled my eyes when I heard the voice behind me speak up. He didn't know when to stay quiet did he? \"Some of us aren't under 21, so if you want to grab a cold one with me, I'm happy to do that with you.\" I sucked in my bottom lip, both irritated and trying not to laugh at this man's idiocy. Mr Chetty had narrowed his eyes and even though I knew he wasn't looking at me it still made me look down at my hands to avoid his gaze. \"I will not be grabbing a cold one with you.\" \"You get high?\" I took in a deep breath slowly, unsure if I'd heard what I'd actually heard. If it was possible Mr Chetty's eyes narrowed even more, I couldn't actually tell if he was pissed off or amused, I believe it was a little of both. \"I don't get high.\" \"Okay. I'm not judging. Just saying. People do it.\" I jumped when he then moved forwards to stick his face next to mine, both Stuart and I were extremely creeped out when he started talking. \"That being said if you want something cold to drink we'll hook you up okay?\" I shook my head in disbelief. \"What even?\" I said slowly and quietly. \"I'm okay.\" Stuart spoke, trying not to make eye contact although we did exchange an incredulous look. \"Thank you, just stop talking to me.\" He tilted his head away from the older man. \"What about you?\" I opened and closed my mouth without answered, unsure if this was actually happening. \"She's fine too.\" Stuart nodded at me. \"I'm your Bill Holden in Stalag 17.\" Stuart looked completely bemused, eyes narrowed and mouth open. \"I don't even. I really don't get that reference.\" He crosses his arms and pursed his lips. \"Google it.\" \"Go it.\" Stuart rolled his eyes and when he saw that I was looking at him, he nodded his head to the two men behind us and I smiled uncomfortably, gently turning my head to peer at them. They didn't seem to think they didn't belong here. I shook my head and turned back to Mr Chetty as he turned to the next slide. \"Dating a fellow intern?\" Again I raised the red paddle, not noticing the look I got from the boy next to me as he slowly and lazily lifted his own red paddle up. When Mr Chetty looked over in my direction again I knew the two men behind me had chosen the wrong answer once more. Didn't they understand the concept of lying? I sighed to myself and peered over at Stuart as Mr Chetty started talking to the older men once more. \"This is Google, not \" It was strange that he was probably the closest thing to a friend that I had in this place. \"Taking food home from the office?\" I raised the red paddle again, snorting softly when the same thing happened again. \"Are you having trouble with this Mr McManus?\" I wondered which one of them that was. Thankfully my phone buzzed at this point which allowed me to tune out the rest of their painful conversation, I occasionally heard random foods listed but shoved that out of my mind as I started texting. To: Me From: Sasha So, what's it like at Google? x To: Sasha From: Me Boring. Two old guys made it into the program somehow and one of them is getting owned by the Head of the program lol x I put my phone down in time to put up my red paddle again, luckily for me I was able to keep an ear out on the conversation so didn't make a huge fool out of myself although I doubt anyone would be as far on the bad side of Mr Chetty than this Mr McManus guy. To: Me From: Sasha Aha, have you made any friends yet? I rolled my eyes at the inevitable question and shoved my phone back into my pocket when Mr Chetty dismissed us, I pushed my hair out of my face and before I could get into a conversation with anyone I hurried out of the door. Since that was the only thing other than orientation on my list of things to do today I decided to go get some dinner before heading to the accommodation that Google had been generous enough to give us. \"I'm telling you man, we just have to surround ourselves with the right group of these little weirdo's-\" I rolled my eyes at the old guys and pulled a jacket out of my bag, cursing when it pulled out the stupid noogler hat and a bunch of pens and papers. I stooped down to grab everything when another hand appeared out of nowhere to pick up my papers. I gathered the errant pens and stood, picking up the stupid noogler hat as well and looked up with a smile to thank the person for helping me. \"Really?\" I groaned, smile forgotten as Graham stood in front of me, grinning with my papers trapped between his grubby hands. \"I seriously feel like you're stalking me now.\" I reached a hand out for him to give me my notebook but he tilted his head and smiled instead. \"Is that how you treat someone who's being nice to you?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Yes. I'm a horrible person, now give that back and leave me alone.\" I reached forwards to try and grab it but narrowed my eyes when he jerked backwards out of my reach, that stupid grin still firmly in place. \"You know what, keep it.\" With a smile of my own I turned around and walked away. I wasn't going to spend more time than necessary trying to get back a stupid note book that I probably wouldn't even need. I decided to order some take out to my accommodation, with that thought in mind I made my way over there. I pushed the door open and threw my keys on the bed, grabbing my phone and dialling the number of a pizza place that I had the leaflet to. Something I'd been handed by a random passer-by earlier. Quickly placing my order I threw my phone gently on my bed and followed it, flopping onto my back and sighing loudly. Finally, I was alone and there were no creeps around to annoy me, this was the life. My heaven was interrupted by a knock on the door, I sat up and narrowed my eyes knowing that it was far too quick for the pizza to be here. I doubt they would even be allowed in the building, I'd most likely have to go down and pay. Another knock sounded and I got up to peer through the peephole, not being able to recognise the person on the other side so I cautiously answered it. \"Hello?\" I asked with a frown. The person looked up and I let out a slight sigh of relief when I recognised the person as Stuart, he'd angled his face so that his beanie blocked out his features and that's why I hadn't known who he was. \"What do you want?\" He sighed and shoved his hands in his pockets. \"Listen about earlier, I promise I'm not a creep. You caught me at a bad time.\" \"A bad time?\" I snorted. \"Listen, I know I'm stunning and all but seriously? You have no game.\" He reared back a bit with a frown, offended. \"I have no game? I have game.\" He corrected strongly, leaning forwards to peer down at me. \"Yeah? Then how come you're not getting anywhere with me?\" I smirked. \"Wow someone has a big ego.\" He commented, smirking back at me. \"Who said I wanted to get anywhere with you?\" I raised an eyebrow. \"You did. To your friend.\" He blinked. \"Oh yeah.\" He shuffled his feet in embarrassment. \"Well I take it back.\" I smirked again and stepped forwards, intruding on his personal space and peered up at him under my eyelashes. \"Really?\" I bit my lip and leant closer, he gulped, eyes flickering down to stare at my lips. He bent his head to meet my lips with his own but I stepped back before he could, causing him to stumble. He blinked rapidly, his face becoming red as he saw that he'd been played. \"I somehow doubt that.\" My phone started ringing on my bed and I gave him one last smirk before bounding over to it, my pizza was here. I'd left the door open so Stuart was still there when I hung up. \"Where are you going?\" He asked curiously, leaning on the door frame. I looked up at him before locking my door, making sure I had money with me. \"I'm going to get my pizza.\" I said slowly, leaving him there watching me as I walked away. I suppose I could get used to having him around.[Chapter 4] AN: Thank you IrisstoneHPfan for telling me about the little editing problem that I had going on. You're awesome. Chapter Four I woke up with a feeling of dread. Today was the day where we were supposed to pick our teams and that meant I had to find four or five other people to work with. It was not going to be fun for me. At all. I was always picked last. With a sigh I shoved the warm comforter off my body and rolled out of bed, yawning loudly as I stretched and walked into the bathroom. Time to put my battle dress on. My battle dress turned out to be a dark purple sundress that I decided was good enough. My worn converse were the only accessories I needed and with that and a bag to put my keys and phone in I was off. I made my way over to the bigger hall we were told to meet in, positioning myself on the edge of the row as I was quickly surrounded by those who'd made friends with one another and promptly ignored my existence. I scowled at the nearest person to me who quickly became silent to the worry of their friend. Oops. I didn't have long to be in a mood however as one of the men stood up quickly introducing himself as Sid. I could tell he was going to say something heartwarming about us picking out teams or something along those lines and so apparently could Mr Chetty as he stole the microphone from Sid. \"You have 5 minutes, pick your team.\" This was the moment I was dreading. I stood up and looked at all the people that were running to the people they knew so that they could have a friendly and familiar face to go through this experience with. My eyes widened in shock at how everyone jumped up and scurried around trying to find other people to join their team, I suppose I would have been the same had it not been for Graham heading towards me. As I hurried to hide from him, I missed how Stuart had turned to me and his eyes followed me as I ran away. Those same eyes narrowed in anger as they watched Graham chase after me. \"Excuse me, out of my way.\" My eyes widened in horror as I heard the voice of Graham swiftly making its way over to me. \"Crap.\" I hissed, taking this moment to shove some people away from me and hide from the Brit who was still pushing his way through people to find me. I knew this for a fact as he was actually calling my name, but he was stopped by some unfortunately large boy who Graham scowled at. I felt sorry for that kid. In those five minutes I was running away from Graham I'd spent the majority of that hiding behind the two older men, whom I knew Graham wouldn't go near. The only problem with this tactic was that I had to hide from them as well. No one else would go with them and this was obviously making them desperate. I had that same desperation not to be a part of Graham's team. He would drive me insane. I ducked and weaved around the two old guys whose names escaped me at this moment as one tried to pull me into a hug. \"Sorry got to dash.\" I apologised, risking a look behind me to see that Graham had acquired some team members and he was directing them towards me. \"Crap.\" For the rest of the five minutes I could be found dodging around the groups and occasionally being called out to by Graham, the group of Googlers who were going to be mentoring us had their eyes fixed on me and I could swear that the majority of them found my plight amusing. It seemed as though I'd left it too long to actually find myself part of a group however as Graham finally gave up and instead chose some blonde chick \"on account of her physical appearance\" and that was his team full. But now I was stuck with the rejects, which unfortunately mean that I was a self-inflicted reject. An upside to this was that my good friend Stuart was also in my group. I bounded down the remaining stairs to where he was sat, still on the godforsaken phone and sat next to him. \"Hey buddy.\" I grinned at him, turning to look at the front of the room to make sure that Chetty wasn't about to start talking before turning back to him. He narrowed his eyes at me in suspicion before returning his gaze back to his phone. \"Are you being nice to me right now? Is that what's happening?\" I snorted. \"Well I could be mean to you if you want.\" I leaned a little closer, enjoying the way his breath hitched. \"I didn't know you liked that sort of thing.\" He gulped and looked across at me, about to reply but our attention was called elsewhere. The only more senior member left to mentor us was a geeky nervous looking guy who first approached the two older guys and then called out to the rest of us. \"Look let's get a team meet going everybody. Come on team meet time.\" He fist pumped the air as we slowly moved towards him and followed him into a different room. I decided to take the sofa, falling onto it softly, feeling my skirt rise as I did so which made me rearrange as I sat up properly. Stuart sat down next to me, pausing to give me an unidentifiable look that made me slightly uneasy. The others followed my lead and arranged themselves around the room. \"All right, let's get some meet and greet going up in this heezy. I'm Lyle, and it's pretty much WYSIWYG... \"what you see is what you get. \" I've been here at the Goog for four years, working on seven projies en este momento.\" I stared at Lyle in astonishment, was he really like this all the time? I looked at his earnest face and figured he must be. This was going to be interesting. \"Wow, seven projects?\" Billy, I believe his name was asked, impressed. \"Hey, they ask, and I do's it.\" He made wild hand gestures as he spoke, something that made me amused, he just seemed really nervous. \"What can I say, I'm a people pleaser, especially the ladies.\" He turned to Neha and smiled at her, leaning in a bit. \"My Mercedes. So it's all good in Lyle's hood, you heard?\" Stuart seemed to have reached the end of his patience with poor Lyle. \"Uh, yeah, is Lyle always gonna be referring to himself in the third person? 'Cause if he is, I might want to punch Lyle in the face.\" I turned to him and punched him on the shoulder. \"Don't listen to him Lyle he's just jealous your face isn't surgically attached to your phone.\" Stuart sneered at me and did in fact go back to his phone, making me roll my eyes. \"Okay, tough but fair. Good note. Lyle's still a little nervous. Shh... Uh, first-time manager; Lyle's a first-time... I'm gonna stop doing that. I'm gonna cut it out. Keep it to first and second person. Who's next?\" I was then introduced to Yo-yo, Billy, Nick and Neha. None of these people were really who I wanted on my team and I found myself more and more annoyed at Graham and how he ruined my chances to find a good team, one that didn't have the two oldies in. I didn't listen to anything anyone else was saying, just staring at the two old men in annoyance. I stopped only when Stuart starting waving his hand in front of my face. \"You okay?\" He asked. I blinked and nodded, standing up and following the rest of them to wherever we were going. Stuart continued looking at me until we were sat down until his phone beeped and he went back to it. The lecture that we were attending turned out to be about code, something I was already very familiar with, I payed attention to it just in case there was something I didn't know. I knew all of it. I turned my attention back to Stuart, studying his features, my eyes drawn to the little mole on his cheek. The more I stared at it, the more I found it adorable. Holy shit.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five After the seminar we were free to leave, I left quickly deciding not to stop and chat to my new team because I wanted to get to terms with my new discovery. I headed down to the nearest café and sat down, putting my head onto my folded arms and letting out a sigh. This was going to complicate things. But it didn't have to. I felt as though a light went off in my brain, I could just pretend like nothing changed. It was only a little attraction. I could have smacked myself in the face for acting so childish about something so simple but that was the only way I was able to deal with it. I was awkward that way. That was my new course of action, to pretend like I felt nothing. Perfect. The waitress wandered over with a pencil behind her ear and smiled at me. \"Hello, what can I get you?\" I hadn't even looked at the menu. I grasped it in front of me and ordered the first thing I saw which was tomato soup. Luckily I quite liked tomato soup. I leaned against the headrest behind me, the leathery seat was starting to stick to my legs because it was quite warm in here and when I moved slightly I could feel my skin peel off it. Lovely. While I was preoccupied with this I didn't notice someone sit in front of me until his stupid mouth started talking. \"Nice to see you again.\" I looked up, startled before I groaned in annoyance. \"Go away.\" Graham smirked at me and reached over to grab a menu. \"I don't think so sweetheart.\" His eyes skimmed over the text before he placed it back down and reached over in an attempt to grab my hand. I swatted him away and crossed my arms over my chest before glaring at him. \"Get lost Graham. I don't want to talk to you.\" \"And why is that?\" I snorted and quickly pretended I didn't when the waitress came back over with my soup and smiled at Graham before asking what he wanted. \"He's not staying.\" I told her before he could open his mouth. She looked a bit startled as I interrupted but I think woman's intuition kicked in and she realized that he was irritating me. \"Okay, if you need anything sweetie just shout.\" She winked at me and walked back behind the counter to serve some of the other customers. I turned back to Graham to see him with his elbows on the table with his fingers pressed together, smirking at me from behind them. \"I wanted to let you know that you're not going to win with the team you're on.\" \"I can win no matter what team I'm on.\" I snapped back, completely ignoring the soup in front of me in favour of glaring at him again. He grinned, teeth showing. \"No you can't but I think we can come to some sort of arrangement.\" I leant backwards again, completely confused. \"What are you talking about? You're not exactly high up, you can't do anything.\" \"No.\" He agreed. \"But I can make sure that you still come out of it unscathed. You can still join my team, I'll talk to Chetty, get him to agree.\" I started laughing. \"Do you even hear yourself? You're delusional.\" I stood up before he could reply. \"And my team will beat yours.\" The next morning was a complete disaster. I had trouble remembering my other team member's names and that wasn't even the worst part. It started with Chetty giving us our first assignment. I was sat in the office with my team when the computer next to us turned on and Chetty's face appeared. \"Good morning, interns.\" He greeted. \"Today marks the first of several challenges through which your team will show their merits. While internally dogfooding a new products, a number of Googlers reported a bug that disabled their audio. All two million lines of that code are in the source files. Your job: find the bug.\" That sounded simple enough. I stood up from my seat to follow the others towards some computers next to a big see through board that we were able to write on. We all started throwing out strategies about how we were going to find the bug but what I was most interested in was how the two older men were going about solving the problem. \"Code, right? Codes.\" \"So at the end of the day, we're looking to kind of break the password here right?\" \"Maybe the answer's in the question. Maybe it's something with bug.\" Billy snapped his fingers. \"Eureka.\" \"Bug like fly.\" \"The Fly.\" \"Jesus Christ.\" I moaned, trying my best to ignore their rambling and focused on the line of code that I was writing that would be correct for audio. I was trying my best to continue but Nick tapped me on the shoulder one too many times and I turned around ready to shout at him. Billy got in there before I could. \"It boggles my mind that no one has a notebook out. You guys are focused on writing this gibberish. Maybe that's helpful, maybe it's not, but I guarantee you that what we're saying is helpful.\" \"It's really not.\" I snapped, having enough of Billy speaking and Nick nodding frantically behind him. \"Guy's we're looking for a bug, not a password. They're different things.\" I turned back around to continue writing my contribution feeling as though I was getting somewhere, the problem was that I could still hear the two idiots behind me talking about a fly as though that was the answer we were looking for. Neha had had enough as well it seems. \"Would you please stop?\" \"No, we're working.\" \"No we're working.\" She snapped back, turning around with her hands on hips and mouth set in a determined frown. Stuart noticed the pen Billy was holding and snorted. \"Yeah, and that's a Sharpie by the way, genius.\" Billy looked down and frowned. \"That's my fault.\" He licked his finger and tried to wipe off what he'd written. \"Go ahead and wash that.\" \"Look, guys, I'm sorry.\" Neha began. \"You're not helping. You're just saying a lot of words really fast that mean nothing. To find the bug, we need to scan the user logs and review the code until we find the programmer's mistake. It's the only way.\" She was a lot more patient than I would have been, had to give the girls props for that. \"Except what if it's not the only way?\" Billy questioned. \"It is.\" I snorted. \"Okay, you said that someone programmed it. That means some person in this building wrote that code.\" \"A human being.\" Nick added unhelpfully. \"Let's just give him a name and call him Tony.\" \"Tony.\" Nick repeated. I was close to banging my head on this board just so that I would have something better to listen to. \"Let's say Tony likes kayaking. All of a sudden me and Nick become friends with Tony; we're throwing a few beers back. We're doing a little kayaking-\" Billy continued to drone on but at this point I'd stopped listening and I'd also dropped the illusion that I was. I went over to a computer and pulled up Ajax, a coding program that would help me solve the problem. It wasn't until I heard Stuart agree that I tuned back in. \"Dark and stormy, feeling us.\" \"Yeah, no, feeling you big-time, buddy.\" Stuart nodded his head and did a half smile. I may not have known him long but I knew enough about people to know that he was not being sincere. \"You know what, in fact, why don't the two of you guys right now go and find the programmer.\" I gaped at him, that was not cool. There was no way that they would ever be able to find the guy and even if they could it still wasn't going to help us because this isn't what Chetty wants us to do. I almost opened my mouth to say something, but I didn't. I watched as the rest of the team joined in with coming up with outrageous things that the programmer looked like until they came up with a knock of Professor X from X-men and with that the two idiots ran off to find him. \"I can't believe they fell for that.\" I groaned and leant my head on the counter, feeling another body sit down on the chair next to me. \"At least we can work in peace now.\" Neha said, sitting down on a different bench. Yo-yo started typing immediately whilst simultaneously saying what he was doing which was annoying but actually quite helpful so that we could all do different things at once. Stuart was the one who had decided to sit next to me and he looked at what I was doing. \"Whoa you work fast.\" \"That's because I left those two to it and decided to get to work instead of making up shit to get rid of them.\" Stuart scoffed at me. \"It's notlike you wanted them here either.\" I glared at him in annoyance. \"They're still part of the team.\" He rolled his eyes. \"No they're not.\" \"You're such a dick.\" Neha looked over at the two of us and sneered. \"Can you two please not do this right now, we need to stay focused. We're already at a disadvantage.\" She spun around on her chair to look at Yo-yo. \"Where are we at on ensuring it wasn't a networking issue?\" He continued to type as he replied to her. \"Confirmed there was no packet lost. Almost done checking on whether the encryption had the wrong certificate.\" She snorted. \"I'm sorry almost?\" She raised an eyebrow and frowned. \"Uh you're either done or you're not. You can't be almost pregnant.\" \"Yeah, hey, she would know guys.\" Stuart smirked at her before sending me a small glance when he thought I wasn't looking. I turned away from him as he was still being a dick and looked through the code in front of me. This was going to take forever. Neha and Stuart started bickering and I just could not deal with this at the moment, already feeling my eyes start to strain from reading the text. You would think they would be used to it by now but nope. I blinked sharply and opened them again quickly when I heard \"What the fuck was that?\" \"I was punishing myself for my inferior performance.\" Yo-yo was turning about to be no-no. \"That's great.\" Stuart mocked. \"We got crazy over here and crazy horny over there.\" He turned to look at me but before he could say anything Neha snapped back at him which made them have another argument. Just. Fucking. Great. \"Can you both shut up!\" I snapped. \"I cannot be dealing with this right now, can we just get our shit together and start doing this for real otherwise Graham the fucking Brit is gonna win this and I do not want to deal with his smug ass any more than I have to.\" By the end of this rant I was breathing heavily and the other three were staring at me. \"Great, and she's PMS'ing.\" \"Ugh.\" At least he made this pretending I didn't find him attractive thing quite easy.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six Graham won. His team found the bug and it put me in such a foul mood that when Stuart started up again, I swung my bag and hit him in the stomach, storming away from the rest of the team as soon as Chetty had finished his announcement. What an absolute joke. It was lunch time and I had managed to storm my way all the way into the cafeteria. I got a sandwich, fruit and some water before making my way outside to sit under one of the nearby umbrellas at a picnic beach. I picked at the bread in my hands and sighed sadly. I really wanted to win a place at Google, it was something that would look so good on my CV and be such good life experience that it was really getting me down that it might not happen for me. I tapped one foot impatiently on the floor, seeing the rest of my team, minus the two older guys, with trays of their own walk cautiously over to me. I welcomed them by moving my bag onto the floor. My phone pinged in front of me and I slid it open to unlock. How's it going hunny? Mum asked. I text her back quickly, lying about how we were doing really well and that we were all getting along. She would love that, didn't need to make her worry. Stuart had made the decision to sit next to me, I eyed him as he dug into his lunch. All of a sudden he perked up as Billy and Nick walked over, looking as though they were in pain. \"Hey, did you find Professor Xavier?\" He asked mockingly, taking a big bite. \"Yeah we found him.\" Nick said. \"Yeah thanks for that, really great team spirit.\" Billy continued, looking over our table and not seeing anywhere for him and Nick to sit. I felt a pang of guilt as I realised what was going to happen. \"Mind sliding over?\" \"I'm sorry.\" Neha said, pretending to be apologetic. \"There doesn't seem to be enough room for you.\" I watched them walk away, feeling as though I should have said something before realising that they were old enough to not let some petty insults get to them. At least I hoped so. \"Guys I know that they aren't much help to us but we could at least let them sit with us. They don't really have anywhere else to go.\" I said, mustering the energy for the confrontation that was sure to follow. Stuart scoffed. \"How is that our problem?\" \"Yeah.\" Neha interjected. \"They're already getting on our nerves by trying to derail us on the last task. We can't let them get in the way of the next one. I, for one, do not have time to teach them basic computer skills.\" I sighed and rolled my eyes before putting my head on my hands, returning to picking the bread of my sandwich. \"Manners don't cost anything.\" I reminded her lightly, not pausing to look at her but I could feel the new contempt she has for me. \"Well as long as they actually contribute to the next task maybe I will think about being nice to them.\" She said. \"What exactly is the next task?\" I asked, feeling as though Chetty may have mentioned it on the presentation but I was too angry at losing to have listened. Stuart caught my attention with his smirk. He reached out a hand and gently picked a bit of fluff from my shoulder. \"We're going to play Quidditch.\" Quidditch. As a massive Harry Potter nerd you can only imagine how amazing I was feeling right now to finally be able to play a game that I had read, and watched in movies, for years. I had always pictured it to be with a team I actually liked and actually stood a chance but this would have to make do. The game consisted of seven players. A seeker, two beaters, a keeper and three chasers. In an actual quidditch game we would have three balls, a quaffle, two bludgers and a golden snitch but in this game we appeared to have a dodgeball. We even had broomsticks that we were going to have to run around with. I wasn't sure how good I would be with this stick getting in the way but I was going to try. If I got to play against Graham I would aim the dodgeball at his head. I didn't hate him, I promise. I scrunched up my face in thought. Actually, yeah I did hate him. I stood with my team, in our yellow bibs, unhappy we were going to be Hufflepuff but not having much of a say in our house choice, watching Chetty as he held a microphone on the side of the field. \"Alright teams, welcome to the Quidditch pitch. Let's have a good, clean match Nooglers.\" Lyle gathered us in front of him in a huddle. \"Rules.\" He began. \"The Beaters toos the Bludgers at the Chasers, then get the Quaffle through the ring. No blagging, blatching, bumping, haversacking or Quaffle-pocking. No Imperius Curses or Confundus Charms. In the unlikely event of a Dementor attack use the Patronus Charm, I recommend the stag personally.\" Billy and Nick stood there like they had no idea what Lyle had just said and to me that was an injustice to the Harry Potter books. I shook my head in disappointment at them. Niha seemed to have caught on to them as well. \"Lyle, they have no idea what you're talking about. Use your muggle words.\" \"You're making me feel like I'm back in math class.\" Billy complained. \"You got a couple savants here with good hand eye co-ordination, say \"Game on\" and let us play!\" I could see the gears working in Lyle's head. \"Version 2.0. Peg them with kickballs before they throw the volleyball through the hoop. Brooms in, people. Hufflepuff on three.\" We all quickly put our brooms in the middle of the circle. \"One, two three...\" \"Hufflepuff!\" We shouted. \"Brooms up!\" Chetty shouted. \"Ball!\" The Quaffle was thrown into the air in the middle of the two teams. I could see Graham start sprinting towards it and I hurried to match his pace, desperate to reach it before him. He grabbed it before me, throwing me a cocky wink as he threw it to another member of his team. I growled, feeling frustration rise inside me. I turned in my spot, running after the new person with the ball, dodging one that someone threw at me. I saw one hit Stuart in the head as he was too busy being on his phone and would rather do that than play this amazing game. \"What the hell was that?!\" He shouted, his glasses askew as he looked up. \"Why don't you try looking up and giving a shit.\" Neha shouted at him as she ran past. I could tell that it was me and her that gave the most effort at the moment. Nick and Billy were running around in the wrong direction getting hit with balls and running into other players. Billy took his broom and started trying to hit other people with it. \"Billy stop!\" I shouted, running over to him. \"That's a foul, stop hitting people, you idiot!\" \"I want to hit people!\" He shouted back. I made it over to him as Graham came back over and started laughing. \"Oh for goodness sake, calm down and help us. We're losing! Go away Graham!\" I snarled, watching him as he caught the ball and ran towards the goal again. I vaguely heard Chetty shouting at Billy and then came \"Time out!\" which gave me a huge amount of relief. We got back into our huddle, everyone looking downcast and Yo-Yo looked as though he was about to rip out some more of his eyebrows, I caught his hand and glared at him, daring him to hurt himself. \"It's over.\" Neha said, running a hand through her hair angrily. \"Our team is a joke.\" Nick looked at our downcast faces and shook his own head. \"Well I ain't laughing. Are you Billy?\" \"Hell no!\" Billy shouted, trying to lift our spirits. I admired them for what they were trying to do, considering that we hadn't been too nice to them in the past. \"We need to get our minds right and start believing. This reminds me of a girl who had to start believing. A girl from a steel town who had the dream...\" I held in a smile at his passion behind the words. \"...to dance. No one believed in the welder girl, but she believed in herself.\" Wait a minute. \"Are you talking about Flashdance?\" Neha asked, head cocked to one side in confusion. I snapped my fingers. \"That's the name of the film.\" \"You're damn right I am! The deck was stacked against Alex. You know how she overcame it? By believing in herself and trying. She literally had to become a maniac! Have any of you been called a maniac because you were different?\" Yo-Yo raised his hand. \"My morn calls me a maniac when I tell her I love her.\" Stuart and I exchanged glances as Billy floundered for a second. \"Of course she does, you're a little bit-\" He paused and raised a hand, tilting it from side to side. \"in a good way.\" He looked at us all once more. \"Well, guess what? They called Bill Gates a maniac, too. No question.\" \"Pretty sure that's wrong.\" I said. \"Yeah, definitely no one said that.\" Stuart snarked, texting someone on his phone still. It's no surprise he has glasses he's probably burned his retinas with them being glued to that thing. \"I just did!\" He huffed slightly and moved into the huddle more. \"You guys are getting off the point! She had to strip down to nothing! She had to sit in a chair, pull that chain to nowhere back and douse herself with water!\" \"Where did that water come from?\" Nick asked, joining in on Billy's passionate pep-talk. \"Who knows?!\" Billy exclaimed. \"It came from her belief it was there! She believed so hard, she got an audition at the dance school and she spun. Oh, she spun. And she spun and she spun and she spun herself into that dance school! And into our hearts. Now, in the second half of whatever the hell you call this game.\" He paused for breath and I felt the excitement start to bubble up inside of me, Billy was really good at this pep talk thing. \"Can't we all be that welder girl who wants to be something more? I know you're not excited we're on your team. But we're here. We're in this thing together. So I'm asking you, believe in yourselves. Believe in each other. Let's put on our leg warmers and dance our asses off.\" I smiled around at the rest of the team, Billy had really made an impact with his speech, everyone was looking happier and Stuart had even put his phone down which I considered a modern day miracle. Nick grinned in excitement, gesturing for us all to come in for a hug. \"Come here, you little lovable maniacs.\" We did a group hug and I felt considerable less angry and a hell of a lot more into this game than I was at the start, considering I was extremely excited at the start I was practically buzzing at this point. \"I have an idea that I think would make Bear Bryant smile.\" Billy said, rubbing his hands together and getting ready to tell us his idea. \"We have no idea who that is.\" Stuart interjected. \"But we're listening.\" I nodded, smiling at everyone. \"Yeah, what's the plan? We're ready.\" AN: Hi guys! Sorry it took me so long to update this fic, I want to say thank you for everyone who stuck with me this far and to everyone who reviewed, favourited and followed!

Great, I "},{"Movie":"Internship","Title":"I'm Feeling Lucky","Author":"CrayCrayTay2","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11941045","Passage":"[Chapter 1] OUTFITS ARE ON POLYVORE I ONLY OWN VANESSA REYES The day was finally here. The day that I go up to San Fransisco to get an internship at Google. When I turned 19, that was when I hit rock bottom because that was when I graduated from Brown University. After that, I didn't know what to do until my Aunt Dana from Australia emailed me an ad about getting an internship at Google. In my interview with Ben and Allison, I explained how I skipped from 5th grade to 9th grade, how I speak not only English, but also German, Spanish, French, Russian, Italian, Japanese and Swedish and how I majored in Computer Science, Neuroscience and Physics. When I walked into Google, this place is like geek paradise… In other words, perfect! I have gotten up to the receptionist's desk. \"Name?\" the receptionist asked. \"Vanessa Reyes.\" I said. The receptionist typed my name into the computer. \"Ah, yes.\" she said as she got out a hat that was colorful and that said Noogler. \"Have a good day.\" she said. I just ended up carrying the hat and not wearing it. I was gonna have coffee then someone came up to me. \"The coffee's free, you know?\" I heard someone said. Whoever it was, their British accent is obviously fake. I turned around and saw a guy who has dark hair and dark eyes and is dressed up, nicely. \"Oh, thanks for the notification.\" I said with a small smile. \"Graham Hawtrey.\" the guy, now who introduced himself as Graham, said as he stuck out his hand for a handshake. For some reason, I didn't want to be rude, so I just shook it. \"Vanessa Reyes.\" I said. \"Beautiful name for a very beautiful girl.\" Graham said, emphasizing on 'very'. Really? Is that the best he could come up with? \"So, I was thinking, I saw a beautiful and smart girl, so I was wondering if you want to go out for dinner sometime?\" Graham asked. He went from nice to dickish. \"Okay 1) try a pick up line that is worth swooning over and b) I don't date assholes.\" I snarled as I stormed away from him. I was sitting in the stands and this girl comes sits next to me. \"Can I be the first to say that I absolutely love your outfit.\" the girl said. I was only wearing a black tank top, black skinny jeans, a Harley Quinn hoodie, a black beanie that says ' WHY SO SERIOUS?' in blood red text and black Chuck Taylors. \"Thanks. I totally ship Harley Quinn and Joker together and I went to this cosplay convention and I dressed up like the classic Harley Quinn.\" I said, geeking out a bit. My fangirl face dropped, drastically. \"Sorry for fangirling too much.\" I said. \"No, it's fine. It's just...you're into cosplay too?\" the girl asked. \"Fuck yeah.\" I said. \"I feel like we would get along just fine.\" she said. \"I'm Neha Patel, by the way.\" the girl, Neha, said as she stuck out her hand for a handshake. \"Vanessa Reyes.\" I said, shaking her hand as well. From the corner of my eye, I could see two guys that kind of remind me of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. \"Is it me or does those guys remind you of Luke and Han?\" I asked. \"I was thinking the same thing.\" Neha said. Everyone quieted down when a man spoke up. \"My name is Roger Chetty and I am Head of the Google Intern Program. Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship, oh no. You will do what we do. We will watch how well you do. Now, you represent the finest schools, your intelligence and your achievement is well noted. To excel at this internship, you're gonna need far more than brain power. What you'll need is Googliness.\" the man, Chetty, was explaining. I was laughing along with everyone else on how ridiculous googliness sounds, but Chetty looked really serious. \"Nothing funny. Googliness, the intangible stuff that made a search engine into an engine for change. Now, you'll be divided into teams and by the end of the summer, only one team will be considered a full-time position and the other 90% of you will not. You will be split up and a several hours to acquaint you to our campus and culture. Now, descriptions have been emailed to each of you. I will wish you good luck and it's not luck that you'll need. Get to work.\" Chetty said. I have arrived to the seminar and I sat down next to a guy who is wearing a beanie and thick rimmed glasses, who seems way to interested in his phone. And behind us...are the two old guys that I saw along with Neha. \"Now I recognize that Google is not a conventional workplace. Having said that, we have rules. I'm gonna ask you a series of questions, you're gonna raise the green paddle to indicate yes and the red paddle to indicate no. So, let's begin.\" Chetty said as he pressed a button on his remote. \" Having a beer with your boss?\" Chetty said. Because Chetty doesn't seem to be a guy who would drink beer with his employees, I put up a red paddle. \"Some of you are under 21.\" Chetty said. I know who the idiot, or idiots, put up the green paddle. \"Some of us aren't under 21, sir. If you want to grab a cold one with me, I would do that.\" I heard someone say. When I turned around to see who said it, it was Han Solo. \"I will not be grabbing a cold one with you.\" Chetty said. \"You get high?\" Han asked again. \"I don't get high.\" Chetty said. \"Okay, I'm not judging, I'm just saying. People do it.\" Han said then he leaned into Beanie Guy and I. \"If you guys want something cold to drink, we'll hook you up.\" Han said, gesturing to himself and Luke. \"Okay, thank you. Can you stop talking to us.\" Beanie Guy said. I'm glad that Beanie Guy said us. \"I'm your Bill Holden in Stalag 17.\" Han said. \"What the fuck does that even mean?\" I asked, muttering. \"Google it.\" Han said as he leaned away. I just simply rolled my eyes. \" Dating a fellow intern?\" Chetty said. Last time I checked, Google is not a dating site, so that's a definite no. \"This is Google, not .\" Chetty said. I'm pretty sure that Luke and Han raised up their green paddles again. \"Chetty, excuse me, what about a full-time employee, say management level, but not a direct supervisor, great eyes...and a...severity to her look that is surprisingly sexy. What's the policy on that?\" Luke said. I tried my hardest not to gag because I think he was talking about Aunt Dana. When Luke didn't get an answer, he spoke up again. \"No? That's also frowned upon?\" Luke asked. \"You say no to love?\" Han asked. \"We say no to love.\" Chetty retorted. \" Taking food home from the office?\" Chetty said. Even though the food and coffee are free, that doesn't mean you could take it home, so I put up the red paddle. \"Are you having difficulty with this, Mr McMahon?\" Chetty asked. Those two put up the green paddles again? \"Just to drill down on this, what if it's a perishable? Like pudding that was left out?\" Han asked. \"You'd like to take home pudding?\" Chetty asked. \"I wouldn't mind it.\" Han said as Luke chirped in with, \"Oh, yeah.\" and Han spoke up again. \"If anything is to go bad, is it okay to take it home?\" Han asked. \"Mmmhmm, anything else you'd like to take home?\" Chetty asked. \"Well, salsa or chips, something that's not wrapped.\" Han said. I knew that a war of words would start between Han and Chetty. \"Salsa, chips and pudding.\" \"Or sushi.\" \"Salsa, chips, pudding and sushi. Anything else?\" \"Ice cream?\" \"Salsa, chips, pudding, sushi and ice cream.\" \"Pizza.\" \"Salsa, chips, pudding, sushi, ice cream and pizza.\" \"Not a frozen pizza, but if there's like a nice pie out…?\" Han said. \"I am truly impressed, Mr McMahon.\" Chetty said, coming closer. \"Thank you.\" Han said. \"At the both of you. At how quickly you confirmed my doubts for you. Now, let's try this one more time. Taking food home from the office? \" Chetty said. We all raised the red paddles, even Luke and Han were raising the red paddles. \"Very good.\" Chetty muttered as he dropped the paddle that he was holding. \"Ladies and gentlemen, that is all.\" Chetty said. Day 1 was down, now I wonder how Day 2 is gonna go.[Chapter 2] REVIEW TIMEE!1 No Reviews :( Day 2 at Google is picking teams. And yes, we don't have to wear the ridiculous propeller hats. \"Welcome to Day 2. I'm Sid, eighth-year googler. You guys are new, thus are Nooglers! Now, this place is all about community and collaboration, so you'll be working in teams from here on out…\" a guy with crazy hair, named Sid started before Chetty snatched the mic from Sid's hands. \"You have five minutes. Pick your teams.\" Chetty said, grumpily. The asshole who's not even British came up to me. \"Hello, Brown. You're coming with me.\" Graham said, but when he grabbed a hold of my arm, I didn't even budge. When he turned around to give me a confused expression, I backhanded him. \"I'm not your bitch.\" I snarled. I continued to find some people to be on a team with and I ran into Neha. \"Hey, Vanessa.\" she said, relieved. \"Thank God, I ran into you. You wanna be on a team with me?\" I asked. \"Hell yeah.\" Neha said as we high fived. I just sat down while Neha was standing. Neha was asking if anyone wants to be on a team. She was saying that we were super fun and smart. I just didn't bother to speak up and I continued to be on my phone. When I looked up and noticed that barely anyone was here, I went down the stairs and I went up to Dana. \"Hey, Dana. My friend and I don't have a group.\" I said to her. \"Look's like you'll be with the leftovers.\" Dana said and when I looked behind me, it was Luke, Han, Beanie Guy, a shy boy who seems to be my age, Neha and I on one team. I was about to leave, but Dana speaks up. \"Before you go, be careful of the blonde one.\" Dana started, pointing at Luke. \"I think he's stalking me.\" Dana said. \"Thanks for notifying me, Dana.\" I said as I went back upstairs to go back to Neha. \"According to my aunt, we're left with the leftovers.\" I told Neha. Neha sighed. \"Great. We're stuck with Luke and Han as well.\" Neha said. \"Alright, let's get some meet and greets going up in this heezy. I'm Lyle and it's pretty much WYSIWYG, what you see is what you get. I've been at the Goog for four years. I made, um, 7 projects esto momento.\" our team manager, who's name is Lyle, said. \"Wow, 7 projects.\" Luke said in astonishment. \"If they ask, I dos it. What can you say, I'm a people's pleaser, especially the ladies, my mercedes.\" Lyle said, directing the last statement at us. \"Do you get anything he's saying?\" I asked, whispering to Neha. Neha just shook her head. \"It's all good in Lyle's herd, you heard?\" Lyle added, chuckling awkwardly. \"Yeah, is Lyle gonna be always referring to himself in the third person. Because if he is, I might wanna punch Lyle in the face.\" Beanie Guy said. \"Good note. Lyle's just a little nervous. Lyle's a first time manager...I'll stop.\" Lyle said, noticing that he is still talking in third person. The shy guy who is around my age stood up. \"My name is Yo-Yo Santos.\" the guy, Yo-Yo said. \"Yo-Yo, how about a high five…\" Han started but Yo-Yo flinched away. \"Yo-Yo, eazy buddy. I come in peace.\" Han said again. \"Did you get beat up a lot at school?\" Luke asked. \"I was homeschooled by my mom.\" Yo-Yo said. \"Did you...get beat up a lot at homeschool?\" Han asked. Are these two fucking kidding me? \"Discipline is a very important part of growth. But my mother is a very nurturing person. For example, she provided me selflessly with the milk of her bosom...until I was seven years old.\" Yo-Yo said. I could understand him. My mom breastfed me up until I was five because breastmilk leads to a higher IQ. \"So, tying your shoes, climbing trees, blowing up fireworks, then you got mouth on mom. \"Breastfeeding leads to higher IQ.\" Yo-Yo said. Han nods in understanding. \"Actually, science isn't definitive on that. I was bottle fed and that never slowed me down. Vitamins are vitamins, whether it's from a teat or baba.\" Luke said. \"Wrong.\" Beanie Guy and I said in unison. \"What?\" Luke asked. I decided to let Beanie Guy explain. \"Wrong. The teat or baba thing. It's wrong. I just googled it, so you're wrong.\" Beanie Guy started. \"Oh, yeah. I'm Stuart.\" Beanie Guy says. \"Pleasure to meet you, Stew. You know, you can't trust everything what you read on…\" Luke started. \"The Journal of the American Medical Association? Pretty trustworthy. It says that breast milk has more nutrients, which are more easily digested and absorbed.\" Stuart read from his phone as we all nodded in unison. \"Your confusion is understandable...you were bottle fed.\" Stuart added. \"He's right.\" Yo-Yo said. \"Woah, guys, where's all this hostility coming from?\" Han asked. \"Where do you think it's coming from? ⅖ of our team are two old guys who don't know shit.\" Stuart snapped. \"Okay, guys. I, for one, am very happy to have two...strapping, mature gentlemen on the team.\" Neha said, standing up. \"Thank you.\" Luke said. \"Oh, I'm Neha Patel and oh my God, you guys would be the best Luke and Han.\" Neha said, dreamily. \"Excuse me?\" Han asked. \"Oh, Star Wars cosplay.\" Neha said. \"Cosplay?\" Luke asked in confusion. \"Costume play. You know, when people dress up as their favorite anime or movie character. I'd be Slave Girl Leia. Yeah, metal bikini top, metal g-string panty, leather boots, of course chained to the neck. Not too constricted but just enough to make things interesting.\" Neha said. \"The neck constriction interesting.\" Han said to Neha. \"A few of us get together and whatever happens happens. Oh, but workwise, your skills aren't relevant here...or in this millennium, so stay out of our way...we'll do this shit on our own.\" Neha said as she sat down. \"Well, I'm loving this friction, you know why? That's how you get the fire started. I'm Nick, this is my pal, Billy, and despite what you think, we're just like you, running down a dream.\" Luke, or Nick, said. \"All right, Team Lyle!\" Lyle exclaimed. \"Wait, what about her?\" Stuart asked, pointing at me. \"Well, I'm Vanessa Reyes and I don't know what else to say.\" I said. \"What about the fact that you graduated Brown University at 19 years old? Or the fact that you skipped 4 grades when you were only 11? Or the fact that you speak fluently in 7 languages? Or the fact that you majored in Computer Science, Neuroscience and Physics? Or…\" Lyle was rambling but I cut him off. \"Please stop with the showcasing.\" I said. \"Wow…\" I heard someone mutter in fascination. I looked at Stuart and he was staring at me in awe. I just blushed, embarrassingly as I sat down. \"All right, Team Lyle!\" Lyle exclaimed again and we all gave him a look. \"We'll workshop on that. That's in beta. Our translate lecture is in 15 minutes.\" Lyle said. We are now at the translate lecture. I was just tuning everything out and Lyle was checking out some dancer named Marielena. Honestly, I find his crush on this Marielena girl cute. I was just tuning out the translate lecture as I was thinking about Stuart. Wait, why am I thinking about Stuart? No, Vanessa. This is Google, like Chetty says. But why can't stop thinking about him?[Chapter 3] REVIEW TIMEE!1 lynnenikko666: I know. It's kind of that moment when you wish that fictional characters are real. You will find out about the whole 'Charles Xavier' thing in the chapter and I don't know what Nick will do when he finds out that Vanessa is Dana's niece MiaR: Thanks :) kitsuneblackwater: I will. Sorry about the long hiatus netty511994: I will try to keep it up. Sorry about the hiatus EllieDragon: Graham deserved it karen: I'll try to update. Sorry about the hiatus The next day is when the actual challenges start. \"Good morning, interns. Today marks the first of several challenges through which your team shows its merits. While dogfooding a new product, a number of Googlers reported a bug that has disabled their audio. All two million lines of code are in the source files. Your job? Find the bug.\" Chetty instructed. \"Let's check the user reports.\" Neha said as they all went to the dry erase board and I got out my notebook and I was figuring out how to debug it. \"Make sure to check the logs to make sure there's any red flags and see what exceptions are thrown.\" I added as I was writing how to debug on my notebook. \"I start by drawing up strategies to see through the code.\" Lyle said. \"So, we're kind of looking to break the password.\" I heard Nick said. Oh, they are so far from it. \"Maybe the answer is in the question? Bug.\" \"Eureka!\" \"Bug like fly. \"The Fly\". Is Chetty a cinephile?\" \"Goldblum!\" \"Goldblum!\" \"Boggles my mind how Vanessa's the only one with a notebook out. You guys are focused on writing this gibberish. Maybe it's helpful, maybe it's not. I guarantee what we're saying is helpful.\" That's when I spoke up. \"Guys, we are looking for a bug, not a password. That is two different things.\" I said, not looking up from my notebook. \"Keep going with that human connection.\" They continued to keep talking and I saw Billy with a sharpie and writing on the whiteboard. I finished debugging and now I was clutching my head because whatever the hell Billy and Nick are doing is giving me a major headache. Then they are saying something about excavation and California and Billy was yelling at Nick to get something to write it down. Then Yo-Yo snapped. \"Will you please stop?\" Yo-Yo said. \"No, we're working!\" Nick replied. \"No, we're working. I don't even know what Vanessa's doing, but it's not helping!\" Yo-Yo snapped. Kick in the anxiety. \"Yeah, and that's a sharpie, by the way, genius.\" Stuart said in monotone. Billy tried to erase it away, but it was futile. \"Look, guys, I'm sorry, but you're not helping. You're saying a lot of words really fast that mean nothing.\" Neha said. \"To find the bug, we need to scan the user logs and review the code and until we find the programmer's mistake, it's the only way.\" she continued. \"But what if it's not the only way? You said that someone programmed it. Some person in this building wrote that code.\" Billy said. \"A human being!\" Nick gasped out. \"Let's give him a name - Tony. Let's say Tony likes kayaking. All of the sudden, me and Nick become friends with Tony. We're throwing some beers back, do some kayaking. Tony's bombed on the open water. Next thing you know, we're gabbing about audio bugs.\" Billy said. \"Yeah, actually, I think that's a great idea.\" Stuart said. I raised my eyebrow in suspicion. \"Great! Finally!\" Nick said. \"Dark and Stormy feeling us.\" Billy said. \"Feeling you big time, buddy. In fact, why don't the two of you go and find the programmer.\" Stuart said. \"Great. Great idea. Yo-Yo, who's our man?\" Nick asked. \"His name is Charles Xavier.\" Yo-Yo said as everyone started to describe Professor X in X-Men. \"Back to work, guys.\" Neha said once Billy and Nick left. I was now shaking my head, glaring down at my notebook. I can't believe that they would do that. Even though they might be older than us, those two are still a part of our team. \"Vanessa, you okay?\" I heard Neha asked. I glared at my team, still shaking my head. Everyone was still confused and then, I threw my notebook off of my lap, grabbed my Supernatural hobo bag and stormed off, leaving everyone here confused. Stuart's POV: Like everyone else, I was confused. What the hell was that all about with Vanessa? While I was still arguing with Crazy Horny, I noticed that Lyle went over somewhere and now I noticed that Vanessa had left her notebook here from when she stormed off. Lyle opened the notebook and his eyes went wide. \"Uh, guys. Vanessa already found the bug.\" Lyle said. Before any of us could react, Chetty appears on the screen. \"A group has already found the bug. You all can go to lunch.\" Chetty said. Isn't that great? We lost the challenge, we have two old guys on the team and the girl that is most likely smarter than our team combined is now pissed at us.[Chapter 4] REVIEW TIMEE!1 Princess171: Thanks. I'm trying hard to not make her a Mary Sue character Xxrancooniesx: I will update At lunch, I was sitting near a guy with long hair and he had headphones on and he seemed a little preoccupied on his laptop. I was eating my lunch while reading fanfiction on my phone and when I looked up, Billy and Nick were coming towards the table. \"Hi, Headphones, Vanessa. Mind if we sit here?\" I heard Billy asked. I gave them a small smile and the guy didn't look up from his laptop. \"We'll take that as a yes.\" Nick said as they both sat down next to us. As Billy was commenting on how the guy was a superhero on his laptop, Nick turned to me. \"I noticed you weren't…\" Nick started but I cut him off. \"Sitting with the others?\" I asked, finishing up his statement. \"Well, yeah.\" Nick added. \"It's kind of obvious. They were treating you two like shit. No offense, but you guys are old, yes, but you two are a part of our team and that doesn't give them right to treat you two like shit. I know I kind of came off as kind of a bitch, but I'm also brutally honest.\" I said. \"She speaks the truth.\" Billy muttered to Nick. \"Look at this! William. Nicholas. Person I don't know. Love.\" I heard Graham say as him and his team came over by us. \"Well, I'm gonna go get myself a latte as Graham's presence wants to make me puke all over his face.\" I said as I stood up, grab my bag, and walk away from the table. I was waiting in line for my latte then someone was standing next to me. I groaned as I saw the sight of Graham standing next to me. \"What do you want?\" I asked. \"Hello to you too, love. I wanted to apologize of how forward I was yesterday.\" Graham said. \"I don't buy it. Bitch, you are not Damon Salvatore or Dean Winchester, so you can bottle all of your fake charm and fake British accent up your ass.\" I growled. \"Your team is pretty lucky to have you. You have fire in your eyes and I like it. It's a shame that they don't know what kind of teammate you are. Come and join my team and ditch your team of outcasts.\" Graham said and that set me off. \"Here's the thing you're too arrogant to know about. I have been an outcast all of my life and I rather be that than join your team.\" I growled as I finally got my latte. I was about to walk away, but Graham grabs me by the arm. \"We are not finished talking.\" he said. \"Well, I am, so let go of me.\" I said, struggling to get out of his grasp. Then, Stuart came up to him. \"Just let go of her, okay.\" Stuart said. Graham glared at Stuart before letting go of me. \"I'll see you on the intramural field, love.\" Graham said before sauntering away. We were now at a field and we are playing….Quidditch! My inner Harry Potter nerd is coming out. I had my hair up in a ponytail. Because I am a Slytherclaw, I am wearing a Slytherin shirt with blue athletic shorts, Slytherin and Ravenclaw bracelets, and converse. My team and I run out to the field and so did Graham's team. \"Welcome to the Quidditch Pitch. Let's have a good, clean match, Nooglers.\" Sid said before blowing into the whistle and we went on our sides of the field. \"Rules: The Beaters toss the Bludgers at the Chasers then get the Quaffle through the three rings. No blagging, blatching, bumphing, haversacking, or Quaffle-pocking. No Imperious Curses or Confundus Charms. In the unlikely event of a Dementor attack, use a Patronus charm. I recommend the stag personally.\" Lyle was going on. It seemed like only me and Neha got what Lyle was saying. \"Lyle, these beautiful idiots have no idea what you're talking about. Use your muggle words.\" Neha said. \"And my patronus is a Phoenix.\" I added in. \"You're making me feel like we're back in Math class. You got a couple of savants here with eye-hand coordination. Say \"game on\" and let us play.\" Nick complained. \"Fair enough. Version 2.0: Peg them with kickballs before they throw the volleyball in the hoop. Brooms in people. Hufflepuff on three. One, two, three.\" Lyle said. \"Hufflepuff!\" we exclaimed. I would say that I am in either Slytherin or Ravenclaw, but that's a whole other discussion that Lyle, Neha, and I would talk about later. We got to the edge of our field and I heard Graham yell, \"No mercy!\". \"Tips down! Blue team, ready?\" Sid asked. Graham kind of roared in response. \"Red team, ready?\" Sid asked. \"Bangarang!\" Lyle exclaimed. \"Brooms up.\" Sid exclaimed and that's when the game starts. Game on, bitches.[Chapter 5] REVIEW TIMEE!1 RHatch89: Thanks CrimsonEarth: Thanks MiaR: Thanks and a happy late birthday to you If you want to know how our progress is….it's not going good as planned. We were having our asses handed to us. Graham's team already got twenty points and it seems like Lyle, Yo-Yo, Neha, and I were the only ones on our team playing the game. Billy and Nick were confused on what's going on and Stuart wasn't looking up. \"Lyle!\" I called out and he threw the quaffle over to me. I threw the quaffle over to Stuart, but he didn't look up from his phone and it hit his head. I took in an intake of air, trying to control my anger. \"What the hell was that?\" Stuart asked. \"Try looking up and giving a shit!\" Neha hissed and Stuart just mocked her. The ref called Billy out when he was using his broom as a bat and Graham's team continues to get points. Once Graham scored yet again, Billy called for a time-out. \"Forget about it.\" I muttered. \"It's over.\" Neha agreed. \"Our team's a joke.\" Stuart added. But, Billy and Nick think otherwise. \"Well, I ain't laughing. What about you, Billy?\" Nick asked. \"Hell, no.\" Billy replied. \"We need to get our minds right and start believing.\" Nick said. \"This reminds me of a little girl who gotta get her head right and start believing. A little girl from a steel town who had the dream to dance. No one believed in that little welder girl, but she believed in herself.\" Billy said. He's talking about Flashdance. \"Are you talking about \"Flashdance\"? That movie from the '80s?\" Stuart asked. \"You're damn right, I am! That's exactly what I'm talking about. The deck was stacked against Alex. You know who she overcame it. By believing in herself and trying. She literally had to become a maniac!\" Billy said. \"Have any of you been called a maniac because you were different?\" Nick asked. \"My mom calls me a maniac when I tell her I love her.\" Yo-Yo said. \"Of course she does, Yo-Yo. You are a little bit….in a good way. Well, guess what, they called Bill Gates a maniac, too.\" Nick said. \"No question.\" Billy added in. \"I don't think that they called him a maniac, though.\" Neha said. Nick was about to speak up, but Billy intervened. \"You guys are not getting the point here! She had to strip down to nothing. She had to sit in that chair, pull that chain to nowhere back and douse herself with water.\" Billy said. \"Where did that water come from?\" Nick asked. \"Who knows.\" Billy replied. \"It came from her belief it was there.\" Nick said. \"She believed so hard, she got an audition at the dance school and she spun. Oh, she spun. And she spun, and she spun, and she spun herself into that dance school. And into our hearts. Now, in the second half in whatever the hell you guys call this game, can't we all be that little welder girl who wants to be something more? I know you guys aren't excited we're on your team, but we're here. We're in this thing together. So I'm asking you, believe in yourself, believe in each other. Let's put on our leg warmers and let's dance our asses off.\" Billy said. \"Come here, you lovable maniacs. Get in here.\" Nick said. \"Now, I have an idea that would make Bear Bryant smile.\" Billy said. \"No idea who that is, but continue on.\" I muttered. We are ready for the second half and Sid blew the whistle. We ran towards the ball and when Graham was about to send the ball to one of his teammates, Billy intervened and passed the ball to Stuart. \"Vanessa.\" Stuart said as he passed the ball to me. \"Neha.\" I said as I passed the ball to her. Neha passes the ball to Lyle, who passes it to Nick, who passes it to Billy and we finally scored. Stuart used the screen of his phone to reflect the sun into another one of Graham's teammate's way as Nick scored. Graham was about to score, but I blocked it. I smirked as I ran off. Lyle kicked the ball away from Graham's team, and Yo-Yo hits it with his broom and I caught it and threw it into the hoop. An opposing teammate was about to throw it in, but Stuart blocks it and it was sent to Nick and an opposing teammate was about to throw the ball towards Nick and when the ball was in midair, I kicked it out of the way, tripping her up and Nick scored. \"Let's go guys.\" I muttered as we were going towards Graham's side of the field. The blonde guy was coming after me, so I threw my broom, underneath the legs and I put my hands on his shoulders, and flipped myself over him, landing on my feet perfectly and grabbing my broom. Neha throws the ball into the hoop, tying up the game. Then, \"Jump Around\" starts playing as a guy in a golden suit came out on the field. \"It's the Golden Snitch!\" Lyle yelled. I started running towards the tennis ball, and so did Graham, Billy, and Nick. Graham pulled my broom from behind and I would of fell on my face, but I did a front handspring to break my fall and my broom was in my hands as I did that, so I was back on my feet and running. Graham has a bewildered expression as he saw my comeback. \"Eat shit, bitch!\" I exclaimed as I ran passed him. He then pushed Nick and I out of the way and jerked Billy's broom upwards and he eventually got the snitch. \"Watashi wa anata no Dikku o rippingu suru tsumoridesu, anata wa chīsana meinu!\" I screamed out in Japanese. I was ranting in the languages I know how to fluently speak as I was about to storm over to Graham, but that failed as Stuart was holding me back. \"Are you okay there, Golden Boy?\" Nick asked the guy. \"Yeah, the Snitch is fine.\" he replied. I eventually calmed down but I was too lazy to move out of Stuart's arms. \"G.D it!\" Yo-Yo exclaimed as he threw his broom down. \"Don't start that, Yo-Yo. You did your best out there. You did your best out there today. That's the first time we all came together as a team.\" Billy said. \"Billy's right. Let's keep it rolling. Keep it rolling.\" Nick said. Neha saw the position I was in and she smirked. We eventually left the field and Neha came up to me. \"What is going on between you and Stuart?\" she asked with a smirk. \"N-Nothing. Nothing at all.\" I said as warmth flushed my cheeks. \"You're blushing! That is so cute!\" she teased and because of that, it caused me to blush harder. TRANSLATIONS (IF THEY ARE WRONG, SORRY.

Sorry it took so long. I was having writer's block within the story I was walking back to Lyle's office with my usual latte in my hand and I heard someone call me out. \"Vanessa!\" I heard. I turned around and I saw Stuart walking towards me. \"Are you sure you're okay? I mean, after what happened on the field, I just wanted to…\" Stuart was going on and I cut him off. \"Stuart, I'm fine. A little fall is not going to break me.\" I said, putting a hand on his shoulder and his cheeks are turning red. \"Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\" Stuart said. I just gave him a smile as I turned away. \"Alright, guys, let's take this new team spirit and apply it to this new app challenge. We got this.\" Billy said, as I was coming up with some shitty ideas for some apps. \"It'd help if we had an idea for one.\" Stuart said. \"Mine are plain bullshit anyways.\" I said as I threw my notebook across the room. \"You bet your sweet ass it would, Stewie, Nessa.\" Nick said. \"No. Never Stewie.\" Stuart said. \"Okay, you don't like Stewie. Perimeter breach acknowledged, Stuart.\" Nick said before he turned to Billy. \"It'd feel good when he warms up to me.\" he said to him. \"It's going to happen. I'll break you down like a two-by-four, bronco. Watch me.\" Nick said. \"Okay, let's brainstorm this puppy.\" Billy said. \"Put the coffee in the pot and let it percolate!\" Nick added in. \"I think it would be helpful to explore what apps have been most popular.\" Yo-yo said. \"Go backwards to go forwards.\" Billy said. \"Oh, and we can bin it. Categorize needle-movers by user.\" Neha said. \"There you go, Neha. Hit it by function and user. Taking out the shield generator of Endor and fighting with Admiral Ackbar. It's not a trap!\" Lyle said. \"Okay, guys, I don't wanna kill the momentum or the mojo you have cooking, but needles and categories, they don't use apps. People use apps. So, I have an idea. People take pictures, right? They have their phones out, they see something, take it, but then the photo is just sitting there. What if they take that photo and instantaneously put it out on the line and share it with friends?\" Billy said. Isn't that just Instagram? \"That's Instagram. It already exists. It's one of the most popular apps in the world.\" Stuart said. \"Yeah, Facebook bought it for a billion dollars.\" I added in. \"Billion with a B.\" Stuart adds in. \"No, no, no, mine is very different.\" Billy said. \"Okay, how is it very different?\" I asked. \"In mine, you're taking the photo out on the line.\" Billy said. \"Online.\" Lyle interjected. \"Yeah, a photo exchange on the line.\" Billy said. \"That's Instagram.\" Neha said. \"Mine has a social sharing on the line.\" Billy said. \"Online.\" \"Quick interjection, when you keep saying \"on the line\", do you mean \"online\"?\" Stuart asked. \"Yeah, it's simple if you say \"online\".\" I said. \"Stuart, Vanessa, don't do that! He's got a million dollar idea there!\" Nick said. \"Billion dollar idea.\" Stuart interjected. \"Even better. Let him flow.\" Nick added in. \"You can't bring me down, I'm too positive. Let me share something with you.\" Billy said to Stuart. \"Nah.\" Stuart said. \"Please, come, the both of you. I'll explain in a way it's visual.\" Billy said and we stood up. \"Be careful, he's bigger than you two, especially you, Vanessa.\" Yo-yo said. \"I already know I'm short.\" I retorted to Yo-yo and turned back to Billy. \"So, you're out there, you take a photo.\" Billy started as he was doing a camera motion. \"Pretend. Go ahead.\" Billy said. Stuart and I looked at each other before we were doing the camera motion as Billy was doing the sound effects. I looked over at Neha and I just shook my head. \"So you take that photo and you put it on the line…\" Billy continued. \"Online.\" \"Put it on Twitter, whatever you want. That is Instagram.\" Billy said. \"That's Instagram.\" Lyle said. \"100%.\" Neha said. \"Or that's just the Camera app in general if you share it out to any type of social media app.\" I said. \"I get it.\" Billy said. \"We're not dummies. And stop with your blunt logic, Vanessa. You're ruining the vibe.\" Nick said. \"Point taken. Now, let's go with my concept. Now, you've taken a photo instantaneously, or not instantaneously, and then you take those and send those on the line.\" \"Online.\" \"You don't have to say shit! You just have to say \"I like that photo\" and share that photo, instantaneously, on the line….\" \"Online.\" \"...with your friends. Now, everyone's exchanging photos. And that's why photos being shared on the line….\" \"Online.\" \"...will be known as Exchangeagram.\" Billy continued. \"Holy shitballs, Billy, we don't have time for this.\" Neha snapped as Lyle opened up his laptop and immediately, a video of Graham and his team was playing out. \"Hello, fellow interns! Graham Hawtrey, here. I've taken the liberty attaching a link to our app, which has already been downloaded 230 times. Booyah!\" Graham said. Again, we're going to lose another challenge, and it is going to be another win for that dickhead. \"Yeah, are you still going to be using that?\" I asked Lyle, gesturing to his laptop. \"No, no, no, no, no.\" Stuart said, leading me away from the laptop. \"We're going to be losing yet another challenge. We're not gonna get these jobs. Our lives are basically ruined.\" Neha said, speaking my mind. \"Preach!\" I exclaimed, agreeing with Neha. \"Hold on. Your life isn't ruined. You guys are 21. You have your whole life in front of you.\" Billy said. \"Do you know what it's like to be 21 right now? A quarter of kids coming out of college can't get jobs.\" Stuart said. \"That's true. That's coming from me who graduated at 19 years old and I'm still working a crappy job at a local grocery store where my boss is a total perv and asshole.\" I said, agreeing with Stuart. \"That's a correct statistic. Mother says you can work hard and go to the right school, but nothing is guaranteed anymore. That's life.\" Yo-yo says, agreeing with Stuart as well. \"These guys are right. The whole American Dream thing you guys grew up on, that's all it is now….a dream.\" Neha said, agreeing with the three of us. \"You're too young to be this cynical.\" Nick said. \"I've always been this cynical.\" I muttered. \"You really see the world this way?\" Nick asked, continuing on with his statement and didn't hear my add-in. \"That's not how we see it, it's just the way things are.\" Stuart said and I nod in agreement. \"That's it. Everybody up. Let's do it. Breath-of-fresh-air time.\" Billy said. \"We have work to do.\" Yo-yo says. \"No, no, no, no, no. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.\" Billy refused. \"Time to hit the reset button. We're taking it to the street. We'll get our heads right, so we can come together as a team.\" Nick says. \"What about the app?\" I asked. \"This is bigger than an app.\" Nick says. \"And by the way, we do have something terrific in our back pocket with Exchangeagram. Just let it marinate.\" Billy said. \"Time to light it up forever and never go to sleep.\" Billy added in as we all stood up and followed him. \"Can we talk about this online/on-the-line thing?\" Lyle asked. \"We're following the morons.\" Stuart said to me. I wasn't lying when I am saying that I might be having a good time right now. We were at a Chinese restaurant. Billy made some joke in Chinese and everyone was laughing. \"Did you know what he said?\" Neha asked me. \"I speak in Japanese, not Cantonese.\" I replied back to her. \"My friend here says there's a dance club down the street that's supposed to be great.\" Billy said. \"You're shitting me. Come on, let's hit it!\" Nick said. We walked down the street and towards the dance club, and as we entered the club, it turned out to be a strip club. I immediately became self-conscious about myself with all of the half-naked women around. I have always been tormented by the whores in high school, so is this where they turn up to be? All I know is that shit is going to be going down once I had entered. ","Summary":" OUTFITS ARE ON POLYVORE I ONLY OWN VANESSA REYES The day was finally here.

The stick came down on her neck, snapping her head back, sending her flying backwards into the brown water. \"Come Jamal!\" Salim called. I turned, tears threatening to fall. With one deep breath I pulled myself out of the pool and ran after my brother. 'She's gone.' In my head I wept, in my heart I wept. 'You must be strong, Jamal.' I told myself. 'Don't let Salim see you cry.' My bare feet slapped against the dirt as we sped through the streets. 'Be strong.' Salim and I found Latika soon after our mother's death. That very night, she became the third musketeer, at least in my mind she did, not in Salim's. \"Latika! Come, come play!\" I called to her, a smile upon my face. \"No, Jamal. I think what would be best now is to wait for Salim to give orders.\" She came and sat beside me though, giving me at least some company. So we waited. We did not have to sit long, for soon Salim came out of the car, arms raised and already shouting. \"Get to work! Do you think this is some type of picnic?!\" He called. \"Give me the child.\" He demanded to a boy as he came closer to us. \"Salim.\" I smiled at him. He turned to me as if surprised I would be here. \"Hey brother, got a problem?\" he walked right past me to Latika who was sitting directly behind me. \"Here, you can have her today. Keep her crying and that's triple the profit.\" Latika glared at him. \"I don't want her.\" She murmured. \"Huh?\" He asked leaning closer, still clutching the screaming child. \"She said she doesn't want her.\" I cut in, also glaring at my elder brother. He smirked and raised an eyebrow. \"Take her or I'll drop her.\" He threatened. He waited for a few moments and then almost did drop the baby. Latika took her reluctantly and set out for the day. … I was eight. Salim was eleven. Latika was nine. That was then, this is now. Now, sitting on a train, just barely surviving with Salim, I still haven't forgotten her. Not once. I haven't forgotten the last time I saw her either. … \"Run Jamal! Run!\" I heard Salim's cries, and looked over my shoulder to spot Latika. There she was, a stupid smile plastered on her face. Sometimes I just think she's happy just to be with us. Like a family. I sped up. The rocks were hurting my bare feet once more yet; I had no care, except just to escape. Why did Salim have to throw that stuff in his face? Why couldn't I just continue singing? I don't think my voice was that bad… I was breathing hard through my nose as I almost reached the train. \"Run Latika! Faster!\" I hollered. I quickly scrambled onto the train and turned to find Salim with an outstretched hand. I took a hold of it and pulled with all my might. We fell backwards, breathing heavy. Salim then went toward the entrance of the train once more and reached for Latika's hand next. \"Run Latika!\" I screamed. Salim had a hold of her hand. It was tight, she was running. He looked up at her face and smiled then let go. He let go. My heart seemed to stop, if only for a moment as I watched her face fall. She turned toward her fate and then back at us. Sadness and confusion written all over her small face. \"LATIKA!\" Maman and his henchmen were creeping closer and closer. They lifted her up and watched as the train sped away. … Not once did I forget. Not once. Author's Note: Um, yeah… well, I tried to get this to sound at least ok but I don't know how well that's working out for me… Um, Happy Easter! So here's a fanfic for Slumdog Millionaire. I wasn't second but I was fourth and four is my favorite number. :) Please review. I need some confidence boosters with this one! Even if all you have are negative comments, all I want are reviews.[Chapter 2] A/N: Hello, sorry it took so long for me to update. I've been working on my other stories, Brighter Than Sunshine and Why Do I Love You? Anyways, hope you enjoy! Life is hard. It always has been and it always will be. When will we discover its secrets? Its beauty? When? \"You have to open your heart, Jamal.\" Latika had once told me. \"Once you open your heart you can then open your eyes and find light, find beauty.\" \"Jamal! C'mon! We have more supplies!\" Salim called to me from the other side of the train, his curly hair was whipping his face. I slowly got to my feet and made my way toward him. We had grown quite a bit since I last saw Latika. I was eight, now I'm twelve. Salim was eleven, now he's fifteen. Once I had caught up to him I glanced at his 'supplies'. It was a box of peanuts, some balloons, and a stuffed animal. From the looks of the animal, it was not new. \"You have resorted to stealing from cribs I see.\" I stated looking up at him. He snarled at me. \"Shut up and grab yourself a box. You want to eat tonight right?\" He stated nasty as ever. Since Maman had favored Salim he had grown bitter. I reluctantly picked up a box and headed toward a window with Salim. We had a routine, because I was lanky and thin, I would crawl through the window and then Salim would lower the boxes with a rope. I would take the box and send the rope back up. Salim would then scramble through the window and we would take out our 'uniforms' and dress in them. Every day this happened. Salim would steal our goods at night, I preferred not to and to sleep instead. \"Ready, brother?\" He called and lowered the box. I quickly got both boxes in and told him to come down. He did and then we both changed into our 'uniforms' and took off into the train, selling the junk we stole. … Surprisingly, the person Salim stole the stuffed animal from paid extra for it because her toddler wouldn't stop crying. That night we ate like kings. Well as close to kings as it comes on a train. Nobody ever questioned our money. That was good too. Salim told me the story to say if they ever did once. But that was long ago and I had forgotten. There was one thing, person really, that I could never forget. She clouded my mine each and every day, during work, dinner, sleep. I even dreamt about the girl. Latika. I wondered where she was, how she was doing, and I shuddered as I thought this, if she was even still alive. What had Maman and his henchmen done to her? Blind her, like that other little boy? I closed my eyes and inhaled. I tried to rip at the seams of my heart, prying it open. Where was the beauty? I wanted to see it dammit! Where is it? \"Jamal.\" I snapped my eyes open to look at Salim. Standing next to him was a girl, a very pretty girl of about seventeen. \"I've got us some bitches for the night with our extra money. Their fathers were practically throwing them on me.\" He chuckled as if this was funny. \"Yours is over there.\" He motioned his head to the back of the train. I peered around him and spotted a girl of about thirteen with long dark hair and bright brown eyes. Latika? Couldn't be. Might be. It's not. I sighed and walked over to her. \"Look,\" she looked up at me, terrified. \"I'm not going to sleep with you. Do not worry. What is your name?\" I asked as I sat beside her. \"Neelima.\" \"That's a nice name. Neelima, where are you from?\" \"No where important, just a small village…\" she trailed off looking down at her hands. \"Listen, did you know a girl named, Latika?\" I asked hopeful. There was no way she possibly could. She shook her head, looking sad. \"I am sorry. Was she your lover?\" She asked, interested. \"No, just a friend. Are you hungry?\" I asked. She nodded fervently. I pulled a roll out of my pocket and handed it to her. \"Here.\" She took it and then threw her skinny arms around my neck. \"Thank you… Um…?\" \"Jamal.\" I supplied \"Thank you Jamal.\" She ate and we talked aimlessly. After knowing that she indeed did not know Latika, I had grown bored. I listened to her hardships and about her family. She had an older brother and a younger sister. Her father regularly sold them off for money and her mother was dead. Her sister was only eight and was no longer a virgin. It was terrible. \"I should go Neelima. I'll see you again?\" I said, standing. \"Where are you getting off?\" She asked eager. \"I'm not. I live on the train with my brother, Salim.\" I stated, shoving my hands in my pockets. \"Oh.\" She then stood up beside me and wrapped her arms around my neck and then kissed me. I was taken back. I closed my eyes and imagined seeing Latika again. Just seeing her would be wonderful. … That night I lost my virginity to Neelima. I cannot say it wasn't worth it. She could kiss amazingly. The only thing was every time I closed my eyes I saw Latika. I couldn't toss her from my head. Even picturing Neelima wouldn't do it. Little Latika. … Not once did I forget. Not once. A/N: Ug. I hope the timing was accurate... Sorry for all the virginity talk. Won't happen much after the time Salim rapes Latika. Thanks for reading! Please review! -Katie ","Summary":" Disclaimer: No, I do not own Slumdog Millionaire, or the book, Q & A's by: Vikas Swarup I looked ar"},{"Movie":"Funny Games U.S.","Title":"Until Someone Gets Hurt","Author":"fingernailcoloredwalls","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7571845","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Until Someone Gets Hurt \"This next game should be really easy.\" Paul sat at the head of a polished, dark wood table. A man and a woman sat on either side of him, a young couple in their mid-twenties, tied to their chairs. They stared silently into each other's tear-stained faces. \"It's like a quiz show. About each other. Since you two know each other so well and all—I mean you seemed to be pretty intimate earlier—this should be a breeze.\" He looked at Peter, who was sitting on the other end of the table with a tennis racket in his hands. \"They should have no problem, right Tom?\" Peter shrugged, nodding. \"We caught them fucking, they should be well-acquainted, don't you agree?\" Peter gave his small, eerie smile and nodded again. \"Fantastic. Now.\" Paul held up his hands, each one with a plastic drivers' license between a thumb and forefinger. \"We'll start off easy. The first one to miss a question loses. And the loser—well, you don't want to be the loser,\" he said, chuckling in an ironically cheesy way. \"Ladies first. Lisa, what is this young man's first name?\" \"John,\" she said quickly. \"Well, all right! Point for you. Now John, don't look, but what color are Lisa's eyes?\" Instinctively the young man looked up from the table, for a split second. Paul clenched his jaw. \"Come on,\" he said gently. \"What did I just say? You're not allowed to break the rules. Peter, penalty for Johnny.\" Peter scooted out his chair and stood. Paul hid a dark smile behind his glove. He'd always liked Peter's unflinching willingness to commit violence, the way he never wavered in his careless attitude towards killing. But the best thing about Peter was that no matter what, he'd never leave. No matter how offended and whiny he got, there was definitely a robotic quality to him, an unparalleled obedience. And he was still, always, learning. \"I didn't see,\" John begged, eyes shut tight. \"I didn't, I'm sorry.\" The frame of the tennis racket slamming into his shoulder ripped a shout from the man. \"Answer the question now.\" \"Blue, they're—they're blue, I remember,\" he stammered, a laugh shuddering out of him in desperate relief. \"That's correct, but watch it. One more rule broken means one more penalty, and that means you lose. \"Lisa, it's your turn again. What is this young man's middle name?\" The woman sniffed, shaking her head. \"I'm—\" She looked up from the table to Peter, who stood with the racket resting on his shoulder. \"Um—Michael?\" \"Oh, Lisa, you're just guessing,\" Paul said. \"John, tell Lisa your middle name.\" \"It's Robert,\" he choked. Lisa barked out a sob. \"Like the Kennedys,\" Peter said quietly. \"What?\" the bound man asked. \"John and Robert, the Kennedys.\" \"Jesus, Tubby, now is not the time—\" \"I was named after them,\" John said, tone tinged with desperation. Sometimes their victims used crap they'd heard on TV. Like that if the killers feel connected to you, get to see you as a person, they won't kill you. But Paul never saw anything less than a person. A disgusting, lying fake of a person. They were all acting their way through life, caged by rules imposed on them by society. If he ever became like that he'd kill himself. \"My mom wrote a book about the Kennedys,\" the hostage said, words spilling out frantically. \"She-she got it published a week before I was born, and she—\" \"As riveting as that is,\" Paul interrupted, \"I think we're getting off the point. Lisa just lost.\" John set his jaw, breathing hard. Lisa began to sob. \"Oh, don't cry. For god's sake. What fun is a game so cut and dry? There is a chance at redemption. If Johnny here doesn't get this next question correct, then you, Lisa, will have another chance. If you blow it, you lose for sure.\" Peter dropped into the chair next to John, sniffing. He set the racket on the table in front of him. Paul glanced over one of the driver's licenses, then folded his hands and looked at John. \"What year was Lisa born?\" \"Oh fuck, I—\" John sighed shakily, hanging his head. \"This is fucking ridiculous,\" he hissed. Paul leaned forward with his elbows on the table. \"What is?\" \"You—you're fucked up, you're both fucking crazy.\" \"Is that your final answer?\" Their victim shuddered against his seat. \"Nineteen…\" He squeezed his eyes shut. \"Eighty eight.\" Paul sat back in his seat, tapping the licenses against the table. He looked at Peter and lifted his eyebrows. \"What do you think? Twenty-three, twenty-four?\" Peter turned his gaze to Lisa, his lips turned up slightly at the corners. \"Yeah,\" he said softly. \"What year would you say, Tubby?\" Paul slid his tongue across his teeth as irritation crossed Peter's face. \"Don't call me that,\" Peter snapped, with all the empty force of a puppy. Paul kept a straight face while Peter blew out a breath and said, \"I don't know, eighty-seven?\" \"You're both wrong.\" Paul beamed, looking from Peter to John. \"The correct year is nineteen-eighty-nine! Which means that Lisa is back in the running. Lisa, your redemption question has two parts.\" He held his breath for a beat. \"What is John's mother's name, and what is the title of the book she wrote?\" \"Ha!\" Peter bit his lip, snorted. Lisa let out a growling scream, rocking violently against the duct tape that held her against the chair. \"Get me out of this goddamn chair!\" Tears slid down her red cheeks. \"I'm not playing!\" \"Just guess,\" Paul said, throwing up his hands. \"It can't—\" He flinched, mouth snapping shut as the woman next to him spat in his face. Peter's smile fell and he looked at Paul, who wiped his face with gloved fingers. \"Jesus, Lisa,\" Paul muttered. \"We were having so much fun.\" \"Just kill me,\" she sobbed. Paul stood, his chair scraping against the wood floor. \"Wouldn't that be nice?\" He gripped the frame of the chair she sat in, tipping it back. Her legs flailed out, shins slamming against the table before the chair crashed to the floor. The loud smack of her head on the ground made John scream. Peter stood slowly, tennis racquet in hand, eyes on Paul. \"I'm sorry,\" Paul said, smoothing his hair out of his face. \"I thought we were having a nice time, but evidently we're not wanted. We'll give you some time to cool down. Tom?\" Peter set the racquet down on the table and followed Paul out the front door.[Chapter 2] ((Author's note: I'm a little tentative to get into Peter and Paul's backstory, and what they do/did before their killing spree, because part of the appeal is that no one knows, and there are so many different ways it can go. But this is such a fun movie to write fanfic for, I wanted to branch out a little. I tried to keep it a little cryptic. Did it work? Yeah, no? Let me know, please!)) \"It's July,\" Peter said quietly. Paul glanced at him. \"Yeah?\" \"Uh. Yeah. I mean, school starts in a month or… or so.\" Sharp and quick as lighting, something in Paul's chest tightened, squeezed. A feeling he couldn't name. Something like anger, but not. It took him several moments just to say, \" What? \" \"People are going to start going home soon, anyway,\" Peter said. \"There won't be anyone here to…\" He looked up, squinting into the sun, then down at the lake that was licking his shoes. He swallowed. Anger was the closest thing Paul could come up with. Anger that was almost paralyzing. \"You fucking,\" he spluttered stupidly. Peter flinched, but his hands stayed clasped in front of him. The perfect little gentleman. \"Are you an idiot? You think you can just go back to school after—you think you can even function —\" \"Don't be mad, Jerry,\" Peter murmured. This pathetic, mopey little shit was making him more furious than he'd ever been, making him lose his flawless composure. He turned on Peter, shoved one shoulder so that the other boy faced him. \"You think you can do anything without me? You think your classmates won't see what a sick fuck you are, Tubby? You're nothing! You won't exist without me!\" He drew little pleasure in the shudder Tom gave, the way his shoulders jerked. \"Before I met you—\" Peter started. Paul stepped closer. \"There was no before me.\" Peter's eyes searched his, for some kind of bluff. It took everything in Paul not to crush that stupid, innocent face on the rocks. A hundred feet away, the back door to the house crashed open, and both boys looked back. \"Shit,\" Paul said. John ran across the lawn, around the side of the side of the house. \"Check on Lisa.\" He took off after John. He didn't need to look back to know Peter was heading back into the house. Paul's anger pumped his legs, his blood. He arced around the side of the house and slammed into John, sending them both tumbling over the front lawn. John had a size advantage on him, but he was fatigued, injured. It was Paul who came out on top, literally, straddling his victim. He grabbed the man's shirt, yanked him up and pushed him into the ground. Hissing in quick breaths, he smashed his fist into John's face. \"There are rules!\" he shouted hoarsely. John gurgled weakly. \"You can't just break the rules, can you? Johnny?\" John gave a small gagging sound. \"Can you?\" Paul yelled, his face inches from John's bloody nose \"N-no,\" John choked. \"Get up.\" He stood, pulling John up by the shirt. He twisted the man's arms behind his back and began marching him towards the front door. \"Peter,\" Paul barked, ripping open the front door. Lisa was lying on the couch, unattended. Paul tightened his grip on John's wrists. \"Peter!\" Peter came into the room with an icepack. \"Her head isn't cracked,\" he said. \"There's just a big bump in the back.\" Her ankles were taped together. Peter sat on the arm of the couch, easing the icepack under Lisa's head. She flinched away from him. \"Let him help you,\" Paul said. \"He's a medical student.\" Peter eyed him uncertainly. \"He's going to help people when this is over. He's going to save lives. He's going to be a normal guy. After this.\" He stuck his foot between John's legs and thrust him forward to fall onto the hardwood floor. It was Peter's fault he had lost his cool, behaved this way in front of their hosts. It was embarrassing, uncivilized. With one foot ground into John's back, he promised himself it wouldn't happen again. \"Peter, will you please hand me the duct tape?\" Peter approached him cautiously, placed the tape in his open hand. \"Thank you. We're going to play another game.\" Paul wound the tape around John's forearms. \"I think Tom will agree with me that these are unusual circumstances. You and Lisa aren't a family, and I sincerely doubt that you love each other. These aren't our usual players, are they, Tom?\" He stood up straight. \"No,\" Peter said. \"And if our last game proved anything, it's that you two don't know each other well. Yet we caught you. Fornicating. In front of God and everything.\" He hoisted John up and guided him to the couch next to Lisa. She sat up slowly, eyes on the ground. \"That's a sin. In a way, it's your punishment, me and Peter finding you.\" Peter stood at Paul's side silently. \"But maybe,\" Paul went on, \"maybe if you pray for forgiveness, God will grant you a painless death. What do you think?\" Neither player looked at him or said anything. Blood was still running down John's chin. \"Do either of you know how to pray? Are you so immoral that you haven't learned one bedtime prayer? Lisa, you never went to church?\" She nodded vaguely. \"Yes? Yes what? You're not being very clear.\" \"Yes, I went to church,\" she whispered. \"So? For your sake, and for Johnny's, I hope you learned a little something about forgiveness.\" She looked him in the eye, her lips trembling. \"If I say it, you won't kill us?\" \"Now, I never said that. It isn't up to me, it's up to God. I will, however, award you a prize to be determined. So go ahead.\" Lisa's hand slid over John's shoulder. \"Our Father who art in Heaven—\" \"Is that how you prayed in church?\" Paul interrupted. \"Touching the guy you were fucking earlier?\" Lisa sobbed, rubbing her hands over her face. She put her hands together in front of her, eyes squeezed shut against her tears. \"Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.\" She hiccupped. \"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.\" Shuddering, she continued. \"Give us this day, our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not—\" She rocked forward, touching her forehead to her knees for a brief moment. \"—not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever, Amen.\" Paul clapped his gloves together. \"That was very beautiful, Lisa! I think He heard that one. You've earned your prize.\" He turned his head to look at Peter. \"See how easy it is,\" Paul said, eyes boring into Peter's, \"to ask for forgiveness?\"[Chapter 3] [urr i just wanted to get this out there. the last half was kinda rushed but whatev] Peter's eye twitched, and to Paul's bemusement, there was real anger in that glare. But he remained silent. \"Now, your prize,\" Paul announced, clapping his hands, \"is the chance to get ahead in the bet. A new game. Tubby, watch our friends. Make sure they don't cheat.\" He grinned, shaking his head at the couple and wagging his finger. \"But you wouldn't do that, would you?\" Chuckling, he turned and strode out of the room. \"What's he doing?\" Lisa sniffed, mouth turned down in fear. Peter grit his teeth and followed Paul out, catching up with him in the kitchen. \"You want me to pray for your forgiveness? \" he hissed, fists clenched. Paul cocked an eyebrow and walked away to the kitchen island. \"You left Lisa and John alone, Tubby. \" He pulled a knife from the block on the counter. \"We're playing Hide the Knife next. You need to make sure they don't cheat.\" \"I didn't do anything wrong-we're partners, you're not God-\" Anger-no-rage clenched Paul's chest, forced a breath up that caught in his throat. He slammed the knife down on the granite island, forcing his fingers to loosen and let it go before he-fuck, before he did something regretful- \"I didn't do anything wrong,\" Peter repeated meekly. Paul's lips curled into a cruel smile. \"You really think you can leave. You think you're a real person, don't you, Peter?\" \"Stop.\" \"Do you remember what it was like before?\" He stepped closer to his partner, who sucked in a breath and held it. \"Peter? Do you?\" \"I-I'm not playing this with you.\" \"Oh, you're gonna play.\" Another step closer. Peter's eyes were wide, wet. \"Think about it. Not all those funny stories I tell, but the truth. What made you this way?\" Peter took a step back and Paul snatched his wrist, shoved him into the counter. \"What is it they always ask?\" Paul's voice was gentle. \"'Why are you doing this?'\" Tears streamed down Peter's face. \"Well? Peter!\" Paul shook him by the shoulders. \"Because you tell me to!\" Peter blurted. He gasped in a breath like he'd just broken through the surface of the lake. \"And did I tell you to go back to school?\" \"No,\" Peter hiccuped. \"Then why did you think you would?\" \"Please, stop.\" \"You didn't know it,\" Paul began softly, pityingly, cupping his partner's cheek, \"and I didn't want to ever tell you…\" His lips moved to Peter's ear, his teeth grazed the flesh. \"...but you don't exist away from me, Peter. Why do you think you have that faggy crush on me? It boosts my ego.\" Reaching around the other boy, his fingers felt for the knife and he brought it forth, pressed it flat to Peter's chest. \"You hide it. The bedroom's behind me. Pull yourself together, for Christ's sake.\" Peter took the knife in one hand, wiping his eyes with the other before clutching at Paul's collar. \"Please,\" he murmured, and he really was goddamn pathetic. But Paul acquiesced, gripped Peter's hair and kissed him as sweetly as he knew how. He pulled away when he tasted blood. Peter licked his split bottom lip, eyes toward the floor. \"Time-out's over, Peter.\" There was no sign of distress on Peter's face when he returned to the Game Room. He even wore that weird, small smile, hands behind his back. \"Ready,\" he said cheerfully. \"Ah, good to have you back, Tom!\" Paul grinned from his spot on the couch between John and Lisa. \"We were getting bored,\" he said, patting each captive on the shoulder. \"But now,\" he stood, \"we can give our hosts their prize. Like I said, this game we're about to play can really help you guys get ahead in the bet. Peter has hidden a knife in the guest bedroom. We're going to give one of you thirty seconds to find it-and, you,\" he waved a hand in their direction, \"will decide amongst yourselves who is searching-before Peter reveals its location to me. Got it?\" Neither half of the couple said anything, but Lisa nodded vaguely. \"Awesome. Now, which of you is going to search?\" The captives looked at each other. John's eyes glassy, face smeared with blood, Lisa's lip and hands trembling. \"I'll do it,\" she whispered, and John ducked his head in a dazed nod. In the doorway to the bedroom, Peter stared at his watch and Paul stared at Peter until Peter nodded and said, \"Go.\" Lisa was understandably frantic, darted around the room. Ripping the pillows and sheets off the bed, shoving the mattress to the floor, then yanking drawers out of their places and upending them. She wrenched the closet open and found it empty right as Peter said, \"And time!\" \"Oh!\" Paul winced. \"Tough luck, Lis.\" The frenzied search continued, eyes flitting, head jerking in all directions. \"Oh, you're cheating. Peter said time was up. Where's the knife, Peter?\" Peter's eyes flicked up to the ceiling fan and Paul retrieved the knife from on top of one of the fan blades, stretching up onto his toes to reach. \"Unfortunately, Lisa, your failure has cost your teammate dearly.\" Paul handed the knife to Peter. Lisa began to rush the doorway and Paul caught her easily, jerking her up against his body. He put a hand on her chin and forced her face in John's direction as Peter stabbed him to death.[Chapter 4] Lisa went limp in Paul's arms as John bled out. He ran a hand through her hair, shushing her sobs and pleas. \"Don't do this, please, I don't want to die,\" Lisa whimpered. \"No, no one does,\" Paul cooed. He stroked her cheek and she jerked forward, unable to break out of his grasp. Panting, Peter pulled out the handkerchief from his pocket, wiped his forehead. He eyed Lisa up and down, resting his gaze on Paul's hand at her throat. Paul smirked. Peter really was too easy. \"You all right there, Tubby?\" he asked softly, tracing the flesh of Lisa's neck with a finger. \"It's four-fifty,\" Peter said, stuffing the handkerchief away. \"Plenty of time to have some fun.\" Paul grinned, skimming his hand down Lisa's collarbone, neck, arm. She shuddered against him, threw her head back. \"You evil motherfuckers,\" she choked. \"You're sick, you're fucking sick.\" \"I know,\" Paul murmured into her ear. \"We're a couple of real sickos. I mean, killing people? Not very well-adjusted of us.\" Peter was decidedly not in a playful mood, which was both incredibly irritating and unfortunate for him, as Paul was always in the mood for games. \"But tell me, Lis,\" he continued, \"you think there's any hope for us to be normal?\" Peter kept his gaze down at John's corpse. \"Cause, you know, between you and me, Peter's been thinking of packing it in. I know.\" He released her and shoved her to the ground, where she stayed. \"He wants to go back to school; can you believe it?\" He stepped over John's body, shoe squishing into the blood, eyes on Peter. \"College, for goodness sake! I mean, isn't that—\" He grabbed Peter's chin and wrenched his face up, but the coward closed his eyes. \"Isn't that an absolute riot? Whatcha gonna study, Beavis? Psychology?\" \"Get off,\" Peter gritted out, smacking away Paul's hand. \"Why are you telling her, she doesn't care.\" \"I want Lisa's opinion. I want to know if she thinks you can do it. Cause, I mean I'm your best friend. We need an objective opinion. What do you say, Lis?\" He crouched down next to the shaking woman. Unexpectedly, she raised her head, looking him in the eyes furiously. \"If he got rid of you, I think he could do anything,\" she spat. Paul smiled, patted her on the cheek \"That's real cute.\" Peter kept his face neutral when Paul looked up at him. \"You hear that, Tom?\" Peter nodded, tapping the bloody knife against his shorts. \"If you think you're the first one to try that,\" Peter said, looking back at Lisa, \"you're mistaken. They're always someone misinterpreting Peter's politeness as weakness. What, you think I make him do this? Please. He loves it. \"I will say, most people don't try to turn him right in front of me. That's pretty rude, actually. Besides,\" Paul pushed up off his thighs and stood up, facing Peter, \"you would never really leave, would you, Peter?\" \"I-I'm tired,\" Peter whispered. \"Tired?\" Paul sneered. \"You think Lisa's not tired? You think I don't get tired? You're so selfish.\" \"I just… want to sleep. I can't do it anymore.\" \"Yeah, why don't you go lay down? I'm real interested in if ghosts can dream.\" \"Stop it.\" \"Or maybe you'll drift off and quit existing. Are you sure you're really done?\" \"Stop it!\" Peter shouted, raising the knife. Paul paused, cocked his head to the side and stepped closer. \"You gonna cut me, Peter?\" \"Just stop.\" Peter's breath shook. \"Kill him!\" Lisa shrieked, and Peter jumped. \"Stab him!\" \"Yeah,\" Paul laughed. \"Kill me.\" He took another step, the tip of the knife pressed into his shirt. Peter inhaled deep through his nose, staring hard into his partner's eyes. \"C'mon. Don't you want to see the blood? I know it's your favorite part.\" He leaned close to Peter's ear and the knife penetrated his shirt. Peter winced but remained still. \"Maybe I should finally get a taste of my own medicine.\" Lisa shifted in his peripheral vision, crawling then stumbling on all fours to door. \"Let her go,\" Paul said. \"Fuck it. We're done, right?\" The back door in the kitchen clicked open then slammed against the outside of the house. \"Please,\" Peter whispered. \"You could kill me. You could tell the police I made you do it. You and I are the only ones who know that's bullshit.\" \"I don't want to kill you,\" Peter hissed angrily. \"You fucking asshole. You know I don't.\" \"No, I know. You want to fuck me.\" Peter's hand jerked forward, the knife breaking Paul's skin, tip sticking into his gut. Paul grunted, breathed out a long \" haaaa.\" His lips spread into a huge grin. \"Well am I wrong?\" Outside Lisa was screaming. Peter swallowed, a choked noise bursting from his throat. \"Should we go get that?\" Paul asked. \"You're the boss, Beavis.\" Peter scoffed. \"Since when?\" \"Since you got a knife stuck in me.\" Peter blinked slowly, looked down at the knife. He pulled it out and Paul hissed. A red spot bloomed on his white shirt. Peter brushed it with the fingertips of his free hand. \"Does it hurt?\" \"No shit, it hurts.\" The implied but unspoken \"Good\" hung in the air between them. Peter cleared his throat after a moment and said, \"I just want to finish this.\" Paul pried the knife from his partner's stiff fingers and walked out the door to fetch Lisa.

Everyone knew Sam had always been different. He had obsessions and spent his time with them, he had to clean a certain way, took things a little literal, and he was a bit eccentric. As a kid he couldn't even read so it was a struggle. He only learned to read a little and could only read up to the first grade level. He spent his time in special ed getting extra help with his school work and kids making fun of him calling him a \"retard.\" He would spend his time with objects and only focus on one and spend his time with it. He even stared at the ceiling, fans, shiny objects, and he would get fixated on something. No one knew what was wrong with him except that he was classically dyslexic and had problems with social skills. He didn't have any friends. His mother always yelled at him and called him names saying he was stupid. She also thought he was lazy. She thought dyslexia was just a made up diagnoses for lazy kids who didn't want to read or do their school work so doctors just made up a name for it to make money. No matter how hard Sam tried, he could never please his mother. Then high school came, Sam found a way to fit in. He started to do his antics in school and kids loved it and they cheered him on. Instead of calling him names and making fun of him, they all thought he was very smart and funny so he kept doing them. But the teachers didn't like it because he stopped doing his school work because he was too preoccupied with his silent acts. It distracted the other students from doing their school work and Sam's mother was given notes about her son's behavior and meetings were held in school with her regarding her son. She was not happy about it and would yell at him about it when they get home. She even tried to take away his obsessions but Sam just kept day dreaming about them and still acted them out, he found ways. She may have tossed out his items but Sam always got more. He worked odd jobs in the neighborhood raking leaves, cutting their grass, pulling weeds, cleaning their garage and earning money avoiding his school work. No matter how hard his mother tried, she could never get him to do his school work. Sam was uninterested in his education. He ignored her yelling and kept doing what he liked doing with his life. Then finally he was kicked out of school for good after being suspended a few times for his antics and clowning around. His mother was furious. Sam never bothered going back to school, nor bothered to get his GED. Because he was sixteen, his mother couldn't force him to be in school because the law was kids could quit at that age. She could have kicked him out but she didn't. Instead she just ignored him acting like he was a room mate in his house. He still worked odd jobs and bought some clothes that were vintage that looked like something Buster Keaton wore. He even bought a cane and a hat and bought some old movie posters. People looked at him funny and he was unaware of the looks he got from strangers. He looked like he came out of an old movie from the 1920's. Then at age twenty six, his mother finally kicked him out. She said he needed to be a man, get a job, get an education. So Sam packed up and headed out east. He had a cousin in Spokane and maybe he would let him stay with him. No one in Seattle wanted him, not even his relatives. They didn't like his antics and how weird he is. No one accepted him but the kids did when he was in high school. But he still did his silent acts just because he liked to and they kept him happy. Some people in the city watched when they see him but Sam never paid any attention because he was too far into his world to even take notice. The city was just too big to notice a strange guy doing his silent acts. When he got to Spokane, Mike picked him up at the station but right away thought he was weird. he was not happy with him. He watched old movies and spent his time polishing his plastic forks, played with his food, spun things on his finger, played with his hat, everything Sam did was weird. Why didn't he just tell Sam to go to bed because he is trying to sleep? Now Mike's work was starting to suffer even though he worked installing cable TV. They lived in a studio so it was just a room and a kitchen and bathroom. Mike was able to get rid of him through a poker game. He told Joon he takes his cousin off his hands. She lost and she had to take him home but her over protective brother wasn't happy. Mike told him \"If you're going to be a baby about it.\" Then Benny agreed to take him home. they had to stop at Mike's apartment for his stuff and they brought him to their house. Sam found himself accepted by Joon, Benny and Ruthie. Three new friends he made but Benny didn't really like his antics. He looked at him funny and always told him to knock it off but Sam never gave up. Benny didn't truly accept him till he drew a crowd in the park and they all liked him. Benny realized he wasn't weird after all and he was funny, smart, not some dumb ass. Now that Sam was living with Joon in her apartment, Ruthie and Benny knew there was something else about him, not just some reading disability he had. While Joon liked her routines and didn't like them being interrupted, Sam didn't like to be interrupted with his routines in cleaning and only liked doing it a certain way. He didn't allow anyone to touch his hat or cane or his puppet, only Joon was allowed to touch them. He preferred the same foods just like Joon did. While she liked to paint, Sam liked to watch old movies. Neither of them liked to be interrupted during their obsession and interests. Joon sometimes worked on his reading and Sam liked how she didn't call him names, put him down and get mad at him. She was very patient. Neither of them liked their peers. Joon had quit every center in Spokane to prove she hated them and Sam was never into people. He had Joon, Ruthie and Benny. Then one day Benny was reading an article in the paper and he came across something. He read it and it seemed to have fit Sam. He called Ruthie and told her about it. This had been a year after Joon and Sam had met. \"Ruthie, I gotta tell you something,\" he said. \"What?\" she said. \"It's about an article I read in the paper. You've got to see it.\" \"Okay. What is it about?\" \"It's about this condition and it's Greek for 'self' but it's a form of it, a type and boy it sure explains everything. I knew there was something different about Sam. It was discovered in the forties but it didn't get recognized till a few years ago.\" \"What is the condition?\" \"I'll tell you, can I come over?\"[Chapter 2] I'd like to thank someone for adding this story to her favorites. Benny was heading over to Ruthie's apartment. She and him were no longer dating. They went out for a few months and things didn't work out between them. Their interests were just different and they both wanted different things in their life so it made them both incompatible, but that didn't mean they couldn't be friends. Now Benny was seeing someone else. But Sam and Joon never had anyone either before they met so it was as if they were sole mates but they had beat losing their virginity before him. One time when he stopped by to give Ruthie and them flowers, they were busy with making grilled cheese sandwiches, he just left the flowers in their doorway. He knew they wouldn't like to be disturbed. When he got to the apartment, he parked his car and ran inside. He knocked on Ruthie's door. The door opened and Benny went right inside. He pulled out the article cut from the paper and thrust it in her hands. \"Read it.\" Ruthie sat down and read the article. \"Well?\" Benny asked. \"Hold on, still reading,\" she said. Benny paced around waiting anxiously \"Sit down son, you're making me nervous,\" she said. Benny sat down in a chair. Ruthie has said that to him before when they first met. After Ruthie was finished reading she set the article on the coffee table. \"I don't know Benny,\" she said. \"Don't you think it sounded a bit like Sam?\" \"Well there is more to it than being unable to fit in and unable to make friends, having narrow interests and fixations. You can't diagnose someone over a few symptoms. Look at the list of symptoms it shows here,\" Ruthie picked up the article and pointed to the symptoms checklist. \"It's about rather your child could have it or not. I don't even know what Sam was like in his childhood. This whole article is about children than adults who have it. We don't even know if Sam had the rest of these in his childhood,\" Ruthie said as she scanned her finger down the list. \"So what do you think he has then?\" \"Does it matter what he has? It's just another new label. It doesn't define anyone. Does schizophrenia define Joon? Does dyslexia define Sam?\" \"Well some of it sounded like Joon too,\" Benny said. \"The restricted routines, her patterns, her preoccupation and fixation on her paintings, she hates loud noise and she hates her peers and prefers her own company but I read that about her mental illness. Is Aspergers another mental illness? Does that mean Sam mentally ill too?\" Benny wasn't sure how to pronounce the name so he pronounced it Ass-bur-jers. \"I don't know.\" \"I gotta show this to Sam then, he would be the only one to know,\" said Benny. He took the article from her. \"You think it's important to tell him about another label and have him think there is something else wrong with him?\" Ruthie asked. \"I'm dying to know,\" said Benny. \"Only he knows about his childhood and he would know rather or not he has the rest of these symptoms.\" He left her apartment and went across the hall and knocked on Sam and Joon's door. No one answered. \"Where did they go?\" Benny asked. \"I don't know,\" Ruthie said who was standing in her doorway. \"They didn't even say?\" \"I don't tell you where I go whenever I go out, so why should they?\" Ruthie said. Benny slid the article under their door. Sam would see it and read it but Joon would probably read it to him. \"Oh Benny,\" Ruthie sighed. \"I think he should know about this,\" he said and headed out the door. He needed to spread the word. Shall I assume he has it too? Ruthie thought sarcastically. He forgot to say \"goodbye.\"[Chapter 3] Benny rushed to Eric's house. He had grabbed another newspaper on the way there. When he got there, he parked his car in the back and got out. He knocked on the back door. Claudia answered it. \"Is Eric here,\" Benny asked slowly. Claudia was deaf so she could hardly hear. She read sign language or lips. She nodded and let Benny in. Eric was in the living room watching a game on TV and having a beer. \"Eric,\" Benny said. \"I have something to show you,\" he thrust the paper on Eric's lap as he came in in the room. \"What's this?\" he asked. \"Something I want you to read. Turn to page A two.\" \"Okay,\" he opened the newspaper and went to the page. \"Okay what am I supposed to read here?\" Benny pointed to the article. Eric started to read it. \"You plan on getting Joon another diagnoses?\" \"What? No. This isn't about her, it's about Sam. Don't you think he might have it?\" Eric kept on reading. \"Sounds a bit like him but he has great eye contact for an autistic. He has you, Joon, Ruthie. He he has all of us. Pretty good, he sure has come a long ways then, You've shown this to Mike yet?\" \"I'm going to. Maybe at the next poker game. Hey let's play tonight and shove the article to him.\" \"I can't,\" Eric said. \"Maybe tomorrow.\" Benny waited for him to finish reading it. After he was done, Eric said \"I don't know Benny. I'm not a doctor, maybe you should tell Sam about this. Only he knows about his childhood. I think he does okay with reading people though.\" \"I already slid the article under his door,\" Benny said. \"You what?\" Eric said. \"I think you should tell him directly. Maybe share it with Joon first but she already understands him without the label.\" \"I'll stop by tomorrow and see. No I'll do it now. I wonder if Ruthie will let me in their apartment so I can get the article back. I hope they didn't come back yet.\" Benny started to rush out but Eric stopped him. \"Maybe you have it too,\" Eric teased. \"What?\" Benny said. \"It's a joke, you forgot to tell me \"bye.\" You always say 'bye' before you leave.\" \"Oh right,\" said Benny. \"Bye.\" Benny was in such a hurry he forgot his social skills. Benny rushed back to Ruthie's building. When he got there, Sam and Joon still hadn't come back yet. He knocked on Ruthie's door. She was still home. \"I need to get the article back, do you have a key to their apartment?\" \"I got it Benny,\" she said. \"You did? Where is it?\" \"I threw it away.\" \"Oh good. That's why I came back. I told my friend Eric about it and he insisted I should tell him directly, tell Joon about it first.\" \"Benny, why do you want Sam to know about this? Do you think it will change anything?\" \"We'll maybe he will understand why he is different, wouldn't you want to know what was wrong with you too if you were different?\" Ruthie shrugged. She had never been there before so she couldn't relate. Oh no, does that mean I have it, she thought. Neah. \"Well, when Joon found out she was mentally ill, she felt happy because it explained why she heard voices in her head and why she heard them a lot less when she got medicated. Even her visual hallucinations went away. So why would Sam not be happy about Aspergers?\" \"Maybe he would think he is crazy too,\" Ruthie suggested. \"I'll just tell Joon first,\" Benny said. \"I don't see why she be upset by it. She wasn't upset with her mental illness but it took her awhile to accept it.\" \"And why did she have troubles accepting it?\" \"She didn't think she was sick. She thought her hallucinations were real and we wanted to keep her in the hospital.\" \"So she didn't accept the label at first,\" Ruthie said. \"It took her a while and when she did accept it, she felt happy because she finally understood it. She didn't take it well when you showed her the group home brochure so how is she going to take it when you show her the article?\" \"Oh,\" Benny realized. \"She is going to get upset with me and think I am calling him crazy but she seems to accept his reading problems, so why wouldn't she be able to accept another condition he may have?\" \"You answered your own question Benny. A reading disability isn't an illness.\" \"But is Aspergers?\" \"I don't know. It said it was a form of autism.\" \"Is that a mental illness too?\" \"I don't know. I only heard it in Rain Man.\" \"Okay.\" Benny went out the door and Ruthie followed after him. \"Are you having Aspergers today? This is the second time you've done it today.\" \"Done what?\" Benny asked. \"You forgot to say \"bye.\" \"Bye,\" he waved. Ruthie sighed. \"Not literally.\" Benny went back to his car and headed home. He would tell Mike about Sam another time but he needed to cook dinner for himself. What has been going on with him all day? It seemed like everyone was saying he had AS that day even though only two people said it. For those who don't know what AS is. It stands for Asperger's syndrome. It can also stand for Angleman syndrome but in this case, it means Aspergers because this is what this story is about. It is not an illness or a disease. It's a neurological condition.[Chapter 4] I think I'll add Humor to the genre since I am putting in humor. Joon and Sam had came home from the movies. They saw an old Charles Chaplin movie because the old theater had decided to show silent films for a week. The admission was free. Sam unlocked their apartment and went inside. \"I really liked how he made a cradle for the baby and used the flower watering can as a bottle,\" Joon said. \"Are you going to do that too if we ever have a child? We wouldn't have to get up at night to feed it.\" \"You want to have children?\" Sam asked. \"Yes,\" she said. \"When?\" \"How about we try tonight?\" \"Okay.\" They both headed to their room to try and get knocked up. * * * Benny rushed over to Mike's apartment the next day after work hoping he'd be home, he could not wait till the poker game. He wanted to make Mike feel like an ass for how he treated Sam. Mike pounded on the door. The door open and there stood Mike. \"Oh hiya Benny,\" he said. \"I wasn't expecting you tonight.\" Benny held out the article. \"Did you know Sam might have this?\" he pointed to the article. \"Have what?\" he said. \"Read it and tell me.\" \"I don't want to read it right now.\" \"Read it,\" Benny ordered. \"Why do you want me to read it right now? Is it that important?\" \"Yes it's important. This might explain your cousin.\" Mike's eyes brightened thinking something happened that made him end up in the newspaper. He grabbed the article from him and started to read. \"Hey this isn't about Sam,\" he said. \"No, but does it sound like him?\" Benny said. Mike skimmed the article and said, \"Looks like the doctors found a new word for stupidity.\" \"He is not stupid,\" Benny said firmly. \"You didn't even read the whole thing.\" \"Well it sounds like another made up condition,\" Mike said. \"What's next? Are they going to find a new word for ignorance and turn that into a condition? They already gave another stupidity a name for those who can't read.\" \"You're a real jerk Mike, you know that?\" Benny said. \"You think every condition is made up. What about Joon's? Do you think she's faking her illness?\" \"No because it's real.\" \"And so is Aspergers,\" Benny said. Mike smirked at the name. \"Ass-bur-jers? I thought it was Ass-burgers,\" he said. \"Sure. I'll have some fries with that.\" \"Very funny Mike. It's a form of autism and you think that is made up too?\" \"Autistic kids are a bunch of spoiled screaming brats who need a good spanking and told to \"shut up\" and sit in a corner. I saw one the other week while installing cable TV. She was a real pain in the ass and the parents did nothing to shut her up. She kept screaming and peeling paper off the walls and the parents did nothing about it. They just said-\" Benny turned around and then he shot back around giving him a punch in the face. Mike fell back. Benny grabbed the article and stormed out to his car. He hated Mike, always had since he bet his cousin. But before, Benny didn't even care how mean Mike was being when he was talking about about him a week after he pounded into town. Then Joon made fun of him and he told her to glue her sequins. Now he wishes he just let her make fun of him. His plan had failed. Didn't Mike have any empathy? Hey maybe he has AS. At least Sam has empathy. *** Benny called his girlfriend when he got home. They had only been going out for two months. Jeanne answered the phone. \"Hey, are you doing anything tonight?\" Benny asked. \"Uh no, why?\" she said. Jeanne was a woman in her early thirties, a few years older than Benny. She had dark brown hair and was attractive and lean. She was a little tallar than Ruthie. \"I have something to show you and maybe we can go out maybe go for a walk in the park?\" \"Okay, I will come over but only because I am curious what you want to show me.\" \"Okay.\" \"I'll see you then, it might be a few minutes.\" Benny hung up and started dinner. He was thinking about how to tell Joon about Aspergers. \"Joon, I have something I want to show you. Would you be interested?\" \"Joon, would you and Sam like to come over for dinner. I have something to say?\" \"Joon, I have something important to tell you but will you promise me you won't blow up?\" Benny was thinking of the best way to tell her. Last time, he had been thinking of the best way to tell her about the group home but instead he had lost it and shoved the brochure in her face telling her \"You see what we've come too, you see?\" She looked at it and started to hit him saying she hated him and she ran away and had a breakdown on the bus and got put in the psychiatric unit. She wouldn't come out or even see him. So Benny knew what he had to do, he owed Sam an apology and asked him to get her back. Once she saw Sam again swinging outside her window, she stopped being mad at Benny and decided she wanted to try living in her own apartment. Benny didn't want to face that situation again. Shall I tell her I found an article and ask her to read it and tell me what she thinks of it. Maybe it will dawn on her Sam might have it, Benny thought. Then Jeanne came over. She walked right in Benny's house. Benny just looked at her not believing did she just walk in his house without knocking. \"Oh I guess I have been playing too much of Legend of Zelda so I forgot about reality,\" she said. \"It's fine, I was expecting you anyway. I found this article and I thought I'd share it with you.\" Benny got the newspaper and showed her the article. Jeanne sat down and read it. \"Mmm interesting. I didn't know there was a milder Rain Man except they are closer to normal but they are slow in social skills and share some characteristics of autism.\" \"I really need to see that movie,\" Benny said. \"Lets go rent it.\" \"Why did you want to show me this article Benjamin?\" \"Because I thought maybe Sam might have it.\" \"I don't know him well enough to know but he is different. The way he dresses, so I can't give you my opinion. Has he seen this yet?\" \"No,\" said Benny. \"I am trying to figure out the best way to tell my sister.\" \"Well you can ask her to read the article and tell her what she thinks.\" \"But it doesn't work that way, I have to figure out a best way to tell her. She is not like other people. She might even think I am trying to place another label on her.\" \"Does Joon have it?\" \"I don't know. I read that her symptoms are part of her mental illness. She was fine in her childhood. It was when she was twelve when she started having problems after our parents died.\" \"From what I have read about autism, it starts before age three.\" \"I wonder when Aspergers starts?\" \"Under age ten I assume since they have no development delays.\" \"So Joon can't possibly have it then since she was normal.\" The food was done cooking and Benny started to serve himself and Jeanne. He sat down and they both started to eat. They discussed about how to tell Joon. \"Why do you need to find the best way to tell her?\" Benny told her about the group home situation. \"You wanted to put her in one of those places?\" she asked incredulously. \"Dr. Garvey told me I should and I didn't want to and my friend Eric said I should too.\" \"So what made you decide to have her live on her own?\" Benny told her the whole story from scratch starting with the brochure. \"I think that was harsh to tell it to her that way,\" Jeanne said. \"I lost it, I was mad at Sam so I lost it.\" \"Why were you mad at him?\" \"Don't ask.\" After they were done eating, they headed to the super market to rent Rain Man. Luckily they did have the it on shelf so they rented it and headed home with some popcorn. I just had to have Benny punch Mike in the face because that is how much I hate him, don't we all? He made Sam sleep under the sink and called him a \"stupid jerk.\" At least Sam got rid of his hubcaps and Benny refused to give him a jump. That's the last we ever saw him in the film.[Chapter 5] Sam was at work the next day when he found a stack of newspapers the manager was going to toss out. He asked if he can take them home. \"It's for Joon,\" he said. Fred knew she loved to paint so he gave him a ride home after his shift. After he dropped him off, he helped him carry in the newspapers. Joon was delighted to see the extra papers. \"More paper for you to paint over,\" Sam said. What he meant was, it was for her to spread them on the floor so she wouldn't get paint on it. Sam didn't like his clean floor getting all messed up. In their apartment, one side was the living room and then in the middle was the kitchen and dining room and the other side was the studio, followed by the bedroom and bathroom. They put the newspapers in the studio stacking them up against the wall. Sam waved bye to Fred and told him to have a nice day as he left. At least he had the social skills for it but he was excessive in it. He said that to every customer at work who left and greeted every customer who came in. Sam didn't know the on and off button. He was just too friendly but Fred liked it. Sam had great movie knowledge and knew every year for each old movie and every star and co stars in them so he was useful. Plus he looked like he came out of an old movie from the 1920's because he dressed up like Buster Keaton. It was a good theme for the American Classic Video. Plus his eye contact was too excessive. He looked right at you and wouldn't look away until you were done talking to him or until you were done talking to him. He didn't know he freaked people out with it. He just figured they didn't want him. The first person who ever wanted him was Joon, followed by Benny and Ruthie, then Eric and Thomas but Mike still didn't accept him. Joon started to lie papers out below her easel. She didn't even notice the article on one of the pages. As she painted the paint went splat on it. Sam emptied out the garbage and brought it outside. But he noticed something in the dumpster when he dumped the trash in there. A newspaper clipping Ruthie had thrown out. Sam grabbed it and looked at it. The mild version of \"Rain Man\" the headline read. Thinking it was an article about an old movie, \"Singin' in the Rain,\" Sam tried to read it but the words were way too hard. It was telling a story about a little seven year old boy with Aspergers. He had problems with comprehending the words and sounding them out so he tossed the article in recycling. Paper does not go in the trash. It was not about an old movie. When the words \"rain\" caught his eyes, it reminded him of \"Singin' in the Rain\" so he picked it up and tried to read it thinking it was about the movie. Gene Kelly sang in the rain so rain man. He went back inside and put in a new trash bag. Then their phone rang. Luckily they had an answering machine. Joon always ignored it but not Sam, he only ignored it when he was in the middle of something and he wasn't doing anything at the moment, he answered it. \"Hello?\" \"Hi Sam,\" Benny said. \"Hi Benny,\" Sam said. \"Hey, can you two come over if you aren't doing anything tonight?\" \"Uhhh,\" Sam was thinking. \"Joon,\" Sam called. \"Benny's on the phone.\" Joon was happy her brother was calling so she put her paintbrush down. Maybe he was calling to check up on her. Benny did that every now and then, it used to be every day, then every other day, then every few days, then a week, then few times a month and then it became seldom. Benny was such a worry wart. Dr. Garvey checked up on her too every week as part of her job to see how her living situation is doing. Sam handed the phone to Joon. \"Joon, are you doing anything tonight?\" \"Painting,\" she said. \"What about after?\" \"Work on Sam's reading?\" \"Well how about I come over there and you can set the teaching aside if that is okay with you.\" Joon started to tug on her necklace, a change, she hated change. \"I'll tell you what, why don't you come over here anytime you want but call me first Okay? I have something interesting to show you.\" \"Something interesting? It's not about the group home is it,\" she teased. Benny chuckled. \"No, it's not. I can't tell you over the phone. I prefer in person.\" \"Then why don't you bring it over here and show me?\" \"Okay but do you want me there, when do you want to see it?\" \"Is it going to be quick?\" \"I can leave it there when I get there so that you can read it anytime you want to.\" \"Read it?\" Oops, he had let the cat out of the bag somewhat. Now he had no choice but to tell her. \"It's just an article and I thought it was interesting.\" \"Why do you want me to read an article?\" \"Can I just come over there and you will see?\" \"Why can't you tell me now?\" \"Because it's complicated. I need to be with you in person.\" \"Okay, come over but make it snappy, my painting in waiting.\"[Chapter 6] Benny headed over to Joon's apartment. He locked his car and headed inside. He knocked on their door. Sam answered it. \"I need to see Joon alone.\" \"O-kay,\" he said. Joon was at her easel painting. \"This better not take long Benjamin.\" \"Sam, would you mind leaving or going in the bedroom?\" Benny asked. Sam turned around and went to their room. Joon knew something was up because Benny had never shooed Sam out of the room. \"Close the door,\" Benny told him. \"Can we sit down?\" he asked Joon. Joon put down her paintbrush and they both took a seat at the table. Benny unfolded the newspaper and tried to speak. \"I saw this article and I-and. Will promise me you won't get upset?\" \"Sam got an audition somewhere?\" Joon said. \"No he didn't. This isn't about him, well sort of.\" \"Why?\" \"Just promise me you won't get mad. Sam isn't going anywhere. I just want to hear your opinion.\" \"Okay.\" Benny set the article in front of Joon and pointed to it. \"It's too long,\" she said. \"Only half a page,\" said Benny. \"You did say you would leave it here so I can read it later.\" Benny had forgotten about that. \"Oh right, I'll leave then. When you do read it, will you call me and tell me what you thought?\" \"Yes,\" she nodded. \"Okay, I will see you soon then. Call later.\" Benny left. Joon told Sam he could come out. \"What was that about?\" he asked when he came out. \"Benny wanted to show me some article so he left it on the table for me to read later,\" Joon replied Sam went to the table and picked up the paper. He realized it was the same article he had found in the dumpster but the article wasn't cut out of the paper and it wasn't all wrinkled. Sam looked up but saw Joon was back to her painting so he placed the paper down. Joon didn't like to be disturbed during her painting. When Sam's reading lesson came, Joon put her brush down and got out some work books. \"Okay Sam it's time.\" Sam was sitting on the couch watching The Birds. He was waving his arms in the air as the birds flew around attacking the villagers. \"Sam, I'm waiting,\" He went to the VCR and turned it off and the TV set. Benny had gotten them one for last Christmas. Sam loved it when Joon acted like the mother. She made it sound like he was the child watching his favorite TV show and his mother calls for him to do his homework. Back when he was a kid, his mother would call him and when he wouldn't come, she would come in the room and turn off the TV and yanked Sam out of the chair and pull him into a room to do his homework. She would even get mad at him for not spelling well and reading well. She hated how she had to help her son with his homework everyday after school and on weekends. Why couldn't he do his homework like all the normal kids? Joon was the mother he never had. She bought all these fun work books and preschool story books from the local supermarket she find in the magazine section. She never yelled at him or called him names or made him feel bad. His reading and writing had improved in the past year so he was now reading at the third grade level than at the first grade level. Sam sat down at the table with Joon. She picked up the paper. \"Do you want to try reading this article?\" What could he say? He wanted to impress her so he took the paper and tried to read it once again. After all it was about Singin in the Rain, he thought. He started to sound out the letters. Joon helped him sound them out. After reading a paragraph, he gave up. He hated reading things that were too hard. They were just too hard to sound out. \"We'll move on to these,\" Joon said as she opened a work book that was for the second grade level. They worked for the next hour and then Joon called it quits. \"Will you read this article to me?\" Sam asked. \"After my shower,\" she said. Sam went back to watching his movie as Joon showered. She always showered every other day while Sam did it everyday. Cleanness was important. When he get a spot on his clothes, he would wash it. After the shower, Joon dried her hair off and brushed it and put on a pair of underwear and a t shirt and loose pants. They both lied in bed and Joon read the headline. \"The mild version of Rain Man.\" She had heard of the title. It was at one of her groups she quit a long time ago and they played the movie there. Joon vaguely remembered it. She knew it was about an autistic guy and she hated Charlie because he was using his brother for money. She remembered everyone made Rain Man jokes and acted like him and teased each other calling each other Rain Man. \"That is so Rain Man\" they kept saying. One of them who had a fear of flying due to an incident on an airplane when he was a kid so he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder, everyone called him Rain Man for it. Joon started to read the article. \"What does this have to do with Singing' in the rain?\" Sam asked when Joon was one forth way through the article. \"This isn't about the movie.\" \"It's not? But it said rain man. He sings in the rain.\" \"Rain Man is the name of the movie Sam,\" Joon said. \"Really? I never heard of it.\" \"That's because it's not an old movie. It's only a few years.\" \"Oh.\" Joon kept on reading. \"I'm not interested anymore,\" he said despite the story being about the boy who couldn't fit in with his peers and every time he tried to make friends, he kept being pushed away and made fun of and he has knowledge about trains. After she was done reading, she put the article on the floor. She would call Benny in the morning. Sam and Joon got close together and started to do the mattress mambo.[Chapter 7] Yey I got over my writer's block so I was able to write the chapter. Labels labels labels, why do we need them? This chapter will explain it. Joon called Benny the next day after she got up and had her breakfast smoothie. Benny was in the shower when his phone rang so he couldn't answer it. He wondered if it was Joon calling. She would call back later. Joon hung up. Then Sam got up. He took a shower and got ready for work. Joon was reading a book at the table. ----- Benny got out of the shower and dried off. He brushed his teeth and combed his hair and got dressed. He had a bowl of cereal and headed out the door. he got in his El Camino and drove to work. He had walked to work before except he took the bus but driving would be faster and plus he needed to see Thomas. His shop was already open when he headed there. His friend Eric who worked there got there before he did and opened it. Benny looked at an old Honda Accord from 1977. It was brought in two days before. \"Ah I see it,\" he said. \"The belt came loose.\" Then the phone rang. It kept ringing. 'Will someone get that phone please?\" Benny shouted. The phone was very loud, it was one of those old noisy phones. \"I really need to get a newer phone\" Benny told himself. Waldo, the janitor, answered it. \"Hello?\" Then he shouted for Benny. \"Benny, Joon's on the phone.\" \"Tell her I'll call her back.\" \"She says it's about the article.\" \"Tell her I'll call her back, I am in the middle of something.\" Waldo put the receiver up to his ear again. \"He is in the middle of something but he says he'll call you back.\" \"Benny told me to call him when I've read the article,\" Joon said on the other end. Waldo covered the mouth piece again. \"Benny, Joon says you told her to call when she has read it.\" Benny sighed. He knew she would get mad if he didn't get to her. \"Tell her hold on.\" He stopped what he was doing and washed his hands and went to the phone. He took it from Waldo. \"Hello?\" Benny's heart was beating. He wasn't sure how Joon was going to react to the article. \"Okay I've read it, why did you want me to? Are you trying to place another label on me?\" Joon asked firmly. \"Joon, you promised you won't get mad and no I am not placing another label on you,\" said Benny. \"I told you this is about Sam so what did you think of the article?\" \"Uh, I don't know.\" \"Did anything in the article sound like him?\" \"Yes,\" said Joon, \"and me.\" \"So what do think of that?\" \"I don't know. Is Sam sick too?\" \"I don't know. I never thought of him as sick,\" said Benny. \"Why don't you read it to Sam and see what he thinks.\" \"I tried but he isn't interested. He thought it was about \"Singin' in the Rain\" because he saw the word.\" \"Well why don't tell him the article might explain everything about him so read it to him and tell him what he thinks?\" \"Why?\" said Joon. \"Because then that would explain why he is the way he is,\" Benny said. \"So?\" \"Don't you want to know?\" \"Know what? That he might have Aspergers? Face it Benjamin, you don't need a word to understand someone. Shall there be a word for normal people so we can understand normality? That would explain your behavior and why you are the way you are and Ruthie and all your friends and Dr. Garvey. \" Benny sighed. \"Okay, fine. If you change your mind about it, just let me know. I need to get back to work so see you soon okay?\" Joon hung up. Benny put the phone back on the hook and went back to work. At least she didn't explode. But was she mad at him now? \"How did that go?\" Eric asked. \"She isn't interested,\" Benny said. \"You know what she told me? She told me I don't need a word to understand someone?\" \"You know, she's right,\" Eric said. \"Why do you need a label to understand someone? In fact why so do we have them? Why not just help them with their problems or accept the way they are, why do we need a label to go further with treatment? How did you view Joon before she was diagnosed?\" \"I knew she was having problems,\" Benny said. \"She had problems with her peers, she was teased, her grades were slipping, and she wanted to quit school. I figured it was just depression. Then she started to have these weird thoughts, and she started to do weird things, and started yelling for no reason acting like there was another person in the room, she got suicidal, and managed to cut herself on her face and left a scar right here,\" Benny pointed above his lip. \"She said it wouldn't shut up so I took her to a doctor to try and get her help.\" \"Were you looking for a label then?\" Eric asked. \"No, and she thought there were people after her and were spying on her so she was in the hospital and then I was surprised at the diagnoses. Well that explained everything because I couldn't understand what was going on. So she was medicated and it took her a while to accept she was mentally ill and as long as she keeps taking the pills, the voices will not happen as often, there won't be any people after her or spying on her, and she will do just fine.\" \"So you do need labels to understand someone. Without them, you are clueless why they are acting this way. But you accepted Sam before that article came along and now you are obsessing about it. Just let it go man.\" \"I can't. It's killing me. I really need to know,\" said Benny. \"Why is it so important? Just take it as a possibility he may have it and take it as that.\" \"It just is. What am I going to say now when someone asked me \"What is wrong with that guy?\" How am I going to respond? \"Oh he might be autistic?\" C'mon.\" \"Well, how would you respond if you never came across that article.\" \"Before, I just thought he was just weird and I had to deal with another Joon but he wasn't as crazy as her. But then I thought he is something, he's special, he has this gift.\" \"Bingo, tell them that then if anyone asks,\" said Eric. \"You see, you didn't need a label to understand him.\"[Chapter 8] Okay I think I have one last chapter to go after this. This story probably seemed repetitive to you guys because Benny is obsessed about the article and the label and he can't stop thinking about it until he gets the answer. I am a repetitive person :giggles:. I also started a new B&J; story and it will be Choose Your Own Adventure. I dunno when I post that. Whenever I am done I guess. Benny went and saw Thomas after work. He called him first to make sure he was home. He wasn't so Benny went to the Emma Sherman Memorial Hospital where he worked as an orderly. He waited in the Men's locker room where employees kept their personal belongings and where they got changed before and after work. Benny waited for a half hour before Thomas and some other orderlies came in. \"Benny, what are you doing here?\" he said. \"I came to talk to you,\" he said. \"It would have to wait. I need to change.\" Thomas went to his locker and took off his uniform and got dressed. He threw his uniform in the laundry. He grabbed his keys and Benny followed him out of the locker room. \"Did you see the article in the paper about a form of autism?\" Benny asked. \"No. Why?\" \"You didn't? But it was in The Spokesman Review. You read those,\" Benny said. \"Well I didn't read the article.\" Now Benny wishes he kept it but no Joon had it. \"Was it important?\" Thomas asked. \"Well, yeah. I wanted you to read it and tell me what you thought of it.\" \"We'll I'm sorry. I didn't know you want me to read it. Which paper was it in?\" \"Few days ago,\" Benny replied. \"Then I don't have that paper anymore, the truck came and got all my trash and recycling.\" \"Oh no.\" \"I'm very sorry,\" Thomas apologized again. \"What did it say?\" \"It was about autism except they were talking about a different kind and some of it sounded like Sam but I don't know about the rest because I didn't know him as a kid but I have seen the other symptoms he has.\" \"Like what?\" \"He has these fixations. He loves Buster Keaton, and Chaplin, he likes old movies and knows every year they came out and who stars in them,\" Benny said. \"He has to do things a certain way and he prefers the same foods just like Joon, he has difficulty engaging with other people unless something interests him, his obsessions, at least has us as his friends, remember when Mike said he spent his time polishing his plastic forks?\" \"I wouldn't assume over a few signs, he is probably just eccentric,\" Thomas said. Then they were outside, Thomas was heading to his car. Benny was heading to his. I'll see you then.\" Thomas waved to him. Benny got in his car and went to Ruthie's building. ------- Benny ran right inside Ruthie's building. He knocked on Sam and Joon's door. Joon was painting when she heard a knock and Sam was in the middle of making dinner. Joon put the brush down and answered the door. \"Hey,\" Benny said. \"I need to talk to Sam.\" \"Forget it Benny, you don't need a label,\" said Joon. \"But I just want to talk to him, I really need to know.\" \"Talk to me about what?\" Sam said. \"Nothing,\" said Joon. \"Just get back to work.\" Sam went back to cooking. \"Do you still have the paper?\" Benny asked. \"Yes,\" Joon said. \"You want it back, you can have it.\" \"Good, you didn't light it on fire,\" he said. That was a sign she wasn't mad. \"Why the heck would I light it on fire and risk burning down the place?\" Joon yelled. \"Because that is what you do when you're mad. Where's the paper?\" Joon went to her room and came back with the paper and thrust it in his hand and pushed him out the door and slammed it. Benny knocked on the door. \"Joon?\" he yelled. \"Joon? Please, just let me talk to him.\" Sam headed over to the door but Joon told him to leave the door. \"What does he want to talk to me about?\" Sam asked again. \"Nothing,\" Joon said again. \"But he wants to talk to be or else he wouldn't be here.\" \"Nothing means not important,\" Joon said. Then Ruthie opened her apartment door. \"Benny,\" she said. \"Are you still going on about that article?\" \"It's killing me, I really need to know,\" Benny said. \"Come in,\" she said. Benny went in her apartment. \"It's obvious they aren't interested,\" Ruthie said after she closed the door. \"Can you see that?\" \"Yes I can see it, I'm not socially blind.\" \"Just let it go, Benny. Just let it go.\" \"I can't,\" he said. \"Why?\" \"I don't know. I want to get it out of my head and the only way I can is if Sam reads it and tells me what he thinks.\" \"Is it going to change anything if he did or not?\" Ruthie said. \"I don't know,\" Benny said. \"I always knew he was different and I couldn't understand why. I thought he was weird because of the way he was dressed, how he acted, and him and his old movies and what Mike said about him.\" \"What do you think of him now?\" \"He's funny, unique, has this gift.\" \"And will the label change that?\" Ruthie asked. \"No, not at all,\" Benny said. \"So why do you need to know if he has it or not. You like him for who he is so do you need a word to understand it?\" \"I guess not but I was just curious.\" \"How do you see me?\" \"You're Ruthie,\" he said. \"And?\" \"You're a waitress at the diner, you're the manager here, you don't have a TV, you're nice.\" \"And would you need a word to understand me?\" Ruthie asked. \"No,\" said Benny. \"Because you don't have anything wrong with you.\" \"What if there was a word for normality? Would you be going through all the trouble in having your friend read that article and see if it fits us?\" \"No because normal is the norm. I better get going and do some thinking. Bye.\" \"Bye\" Ruthie said as Benny walked out to his car.[Chapter 9] Okay this is the last chapter for this story. I had fun writing it but had to end it somehow. This was actually meant to be a very short story but it turned into a long one so I made it into chapters. Benny drove to American Classic Video the next day. He could have walked since he lived so close to downtown but it was wet outside and drizzling so he drove. He parked his car on the side and put some coins in the meter and went to the video store. Sam was there putting movie cases back on the shelf. He had some balanced on his head and he was carrying a tray in his hand and had movie cases stacked on it. Benny watched him put the movies cases back. He take one movie case off the tray and put it back on the shelf. Then Sam saw him. \"Hey Benny,\" he said. \"What can I do for you?\" \"Do you have a few minutes?\" Benny asked. \"I'm working right now,\" he said. \"My lunch break is about to start soon so can you wait?\" \"Okay, how long?\" \"I don't know, when both hands are on the twelve and six.\" Benny looked at the clock. It was only a few minutes till eleven. It wouldn't be for another hour and a half. \"I guess I will see you at twelve thirty then,\" said Benny. \"Okay. Meet me here.\" \"Sam?\" \"Yeah?\" \"How was Joon last night and this morning?\" \"She had a few outbursts last night when I tried to get her to tell me what you wanted to talk to me about and she was fine this morning.\" \"What did she do?\" \"Just threw stuff and locked herself in the bedroom so I left her alone.\" \"I hope it wasn't too bad,\" said Benny. \"She only kicked over a few chairs and threw her shoes at me before she locked herself in our room. She said it was for my own good.\" \"I guess she didn't want to hurt you.\" Benny left and went back home. He didn't care about wasting a few coins. Eric was holding down the fort. Benny had decided he would come into work later after talking to Sam. He only worked weekdays as did Benny. When the time came, Benny went back to American Classic Video and paid to park again. He went in the store. Sam was waiting in the front with his sacked lunch. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I needed to talk to you about something.\" \"That Joon wouldn't tell me about?\" Sam asked. \"Yeah,\" Benny unfolded the paper. \"Shall I read this to you?\" \"Yeah.\" \"To my car where we can have some privacy.\" They went to Benny's car and he unlocked it and they both got in. Benny started to read. It was that same article again Joon tried to read to him. \"That's the same article Joon tried to read to me,\" Sam said. \"Yeah but this is important and I want you to tell me if you can relate to any of what's going on in the article, this might explain everything,\" said Benny. \"Okay.\" Benny started reading. Sam listened intently without trying to be bored as he ate his sandwich. After Benny was done reading a paragraph, he read each symptom to Sam and explained some of the meanings because Sam couldn't understand what those words meant like \"literal in speech\" so Benny had to use an example about the time Joon told him \"You're out of your tree\" and him saying \"It's not my tree.\" \"It's also taking phrases literal and not knowing when someone is being sarcastic, problems understanding it, and jokes.\" \"Yeah,\" Sam said. After he was done going through the list of symptoms and having Sam answering \"yes or no\" to each and one of them, Benny read the rest of the article After he was done he asked him what did he think. \"It's interesting. Thanks Benny.\" \"But do you think you have it?\" Sam shrugged. \"Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. I wonder what my own mother would say if I called her and told her? \"Oh another made up condition to be lazy, stupid and weird,\" Sam said imitating his mother's voice. \"Your cousin Mike said the same too,\" said Benny. \"Those two are lot alike.\" \"Maybe we both got switched at birth,\" Sam joked even though Mike was a lot older than him. \"Now why do you suppose Joon was bothered by the article and didn't want to tell you?\" \"I guess I'll ask but I'm afraid she'll flip again.\" \"Most likely be mad at me,\" said Benny. In truth, Sam didn't understand all the words in the article like motor mannerisms, ritualistic behavior, repetitive behavior, stereotypy, nonverbal communication. Maybe Joon would know. \"But did it sound a lot like you.\" \"Yes and no,\" said Sam. \"So why did you say \"maybe, maybe not?\" Benny asked. \"Because I'm no doctor.\" \"Would you like to see one then about it?\" \"I don't know and I really don't care.\" \"Why?\" \"I remember the label that got placed on me in school and it made me feel like I was stupid because I couldn't read or write and my mother got mad at me about it all the time and she hated my behavior and always said \"Why can't you be like the other kids?\" \"Why can't you be normal?\" \"I wish my son wasn't broken.\" \"You're not broken,\" said Benny. \"Your mother was wrong how she treated you.\" \"I still love her,\" he says. \"I sometimes send her letters but she never writes back despite my good handwriting and use of words Joon does.\" \"How could you love a witch like her? She abused you,\" Benny said. \"She made you feel bad and hate yourself, and she kicked you out.\" \"She's my mother,\" Sam said. \"Well if my own mother abused me, I would never be talking to her again or have any contact with her.\" Sam finished his sandwich. \"We'll I better get back to work.\" \"Wait,\" said Benny. \"If you had this label placed on you, do you think your mother is going to know anything about it?\" \"No. I just don't want another label and then learn there is something else wrong with me.\" \"So you don't want to know if you have it or not?\" \"No.\" Sam closed the car door and went back to work. Benny sighed. ------- A whole week had gone by and Benny had still been thinking rather Sam had Aspergers or not. His girlfriend pretty much told him the same thing Joon, Eric, and Ruthie had told him. He still had the paper but he kept it in his room. His house was a little bigger because all of Joon's stuff was gone. All her toys, books, clothes, art supplies, her paintings and drawings and her furniture. They were all in her apartment. Joon hadn't spoken to him in a week. Benny never called her to see how she was doing and he had never heard from Sam either. Every time Joon ran low on her paint supplies, she would sometimes call him but she usually had Sam do it. If he couldn't because he didn't have the time, she called him. Had Sam confronted her about the article? No she was probably alright or else he would have gotten phone call saying Joon is having an episode. Benny would never know if Sam has Aspergers or not. No one cared if he did or not, even Sam wasn't even interested in finding out if he had it or not. Who wouldn't want to know if they have a condition or not? Now he was going to have to try and get over it. Maybe he needed to get some counseling so he can get it out of his head since he couldn't do it on his own. ------ Benny saw someone the following week. That doctor knew nothing much about autism but he needed someone who worked with people to get over things like failed relationships, divorce, or death of a parent or friend. He was that kind of doctor. Dr. Marshell thought it was something that a patient was obsessing over an article, it was so unusual and uncommon. He needed his question answered before he could move on and now that Sam wasn't interested in getting assessed in it, he was screwed. They talked about the article and the label. The doctor told him it was just a label and it doesn't define Sam. He used cancer as an example. \"Let say someone can lungue cancer, they are them, not cancer. It doesn't define them. Someone has diabetes, that disease doesn't define them. They are them, not diabetes. You are you. What do you like to do?\" \"I like to play poker with my friends and we all bet on items we don't want,\" he said. \"Oh that's a neat idea. You guys don't play for money, you play for keeps,\" Dr. Marshell said. \"Just something we have been doing for the past few years when my friend started working for me. That's how we met. Then one day he invited me over to his house for a game of poker and that was how I met my other two friends. but one of them I don't know if I shall consider my friend. I hate him. He isn't very nice and he puts Sam down, and thinks labels are made up.\" \"Well they are,\" Dr. Marshell said. \"Conditions need to have names.\" \"No I mean he thinks they are made up for an excuse to be lazy and stupid. He doesn't think the problems are real. He even thinks autism is made up too.\" They both talked more until the session ended. Benny felt a little better but he still needed to keep seeing him. He saw him four more times before he was completely over it. It was just a label and it didn't define anyone. Did autism define Rain Man? Did Joon's mental illness define her? Did Sam's reading disability define him? Who was Sam? Sam was someone who loves Joon very much and works at the American Classic Video. He loves old movies and knows every year to them they were released and every star in them and co star. He memorizes lines and silent acts. He loves Buster Keaton and Charles Chaplin and he cleans and cooks the unique way. He didn't care about fashion, he wore what he liked and what felt comfortable on him. So does he have Asperger's syndrome or just have traits of it but not enough to be on the spectrum? Or could his traits be part of dyslexia? Or was he just eccentric? Left you guys hanging huh? Honestly I am not sure myself if he has it or not. I know he was meant to be eccentric in the movie but he seemed aspielike, sometimes people happen to give characters aspie traits rather it's their intention or not. Some people say he does and some say he is was nuts, eccentric, weird. ","Summary":" Another one of my Benny & Joon fanfiction. Everyone knew Sam had always been different. He had obse"},{"Movie":"Benny and Joon","Title":"Troubles With the Bathroom","Author":"NatalieEvans1985","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4955252","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Okay I just felt I had to post this here. I wrote it when I was 18 making fun of Joon's illness. I confess, I have a dirty mind because I keep thinking up of kinky stuff. Sorry Johnny Depp fans, no Sam in this due to this story taking place before he walks into their lives. Introduction. This story is based on the MGM movie Benny & Joon starring, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Aiden Quinn. Benny spends his life taking care of his Schizophrenic sister, Joon and fixing cars. The condition will not be mentioned in this story just like it was never mentioned in the movie. In this story, Joon is too sick to remember to use the bathroom so she is always going in her pants and Benny has to keep cleaning her up and the mess and wash her clothes. He has to come up with a solution to fix the problem so his life will become a little less complicated. The story takes place in Washington in a city called Spokane that is near the border of Idaho. Here is the cast that played the characters in the movie that will be in my story: Benny: Aiden Quinn Joon: Mary Stuart Masterson Eric: Oliver Platt Thomas: Dan Hedaya Mike: Joe Grifasi Waldo: Waldo Larson Dr. Garvey (Joon's psychiatrist): CCH Pounder Claudia: Liane Alexandra Curtis Note: No one played Mrs. Larkspur or Mrs. Piltz. Their names were only mentioned in the movie. I'm not sure who Claudia was in the movie but either she was one of Benny's customers at his shop or Eric's wife so I assumed wife. (Edit: She is indeed Eric's wife. Seen a picture of her at IMDB and read the movie script and she had lines in it. I wonder why they would even cut her lines and cut out their child?) Chapter 1 Joon's Accident Joon was in her studio painting. She was home alone with a housekeeper, Mrs. Larkspur. Joon could not be left alone because she lit things on fire and she did disturbing things to the public. Joon expressed herself by painting. It was one of her favorite hobbies. Mrs. Larkspur came in the studio to take her to use the bathroom but Joon didn't like it because when she is painting, she does not like people to hang around in there while she is doing it. \"Time to use the bathroom,\" said Mrs. Larkspur. Joon did not like the housekeeper because she was hygienically disturbing because her hair smelled. \"Get out!\" Joon yelled. \"Not until you use the bathroom,\" Mrs. Larkspur replied. \"I did already,\" she yelled. Joon always thought she went to the bathroom but the truth was; she never did. It was all in her head. She had delusions. But Mrs. Larkspur grabbed her and Joon got scared. She started to scream and she spat in her face and started to scratch her arm. Mrs. Larkspur got scared and ran out of the room. Joon went back to her painting. Joon was in her early twenties and was mentally ill. Since her parents have died in a car wreck twelve years ago, she started to have problems. First she started to get depressed and then she went onto being violent and then one day, she started to have delusions. She started to hear voices that weren't real and then she started to do crazy stuff and her problem got so worse, Benny took her to a doctor and she was diagnosed as mentally ill a few months later so she was put on medication for it and she has done better since then, but she still couldn't be left alone. Soon, she began to wet herself. Joon didn't care if she wet or messed herself because she was too sick to care. Benny came home from work at six P.M. Mrs. Larkspur told him about Joon's outburst in the art studio when she tried to get her to use the bathroom. Benny apologized for the incident as she left. Benny went back in the kitchen and made some dinner and then he called Joon to come. Joon put down her paintbrush and came out. Benny saw she had wet her pants. \"You wet again?\" he said. Joon looked down at herself. \"Again,\" she said. \"You have to let Mrs. Larkspur make sure you use the bathroom,\" Benny replied. \"You are a grown woman and grownups don't wet themselves.\" Joon didn't care. She went to the fridge and took out the carrots. She got a peeler out of the drawer and sat down at the table. She began to peel them. \"Oh no you don't,\" said Benny. \"You're not eating till you get changed and use the bathroom.\" Joon got up and Benny followed her up the stairs. He ushered her to the bathroom. Joon pulled her pants and underwear down and sat on the toilet. Only a little bit of pee came out and then she was done. Benny told her to wipe herself down there with the toilet paper. Joon obeyed and after she was done, Benny led her to her bedroom to get changed into a clean pair of underwear and pants. Benny took the wet ones downstairs to the laundry room. Everyday, he always had Joon use the toilet and he had to wash her sheets everyday because Joon wet the bed every night and he had to deal with her clothes most of the time. He was so stressed about it because his life was complicated. He wished Joon would stop having accidents.[Chapter 2] Benny was at work the next day. He worked at a place called Benny's Car Clinic. He owned that place and he worked there as a mechanic man. He had other people working there too. One of his close friends, Eric, worked there too. Eric was a chubby guy in his early thirties. Benny told him about his life being complicated because of his sister. \"I can't get her to use the bathroom,\" he was saying. \"She just wets and messes in her pants and she doesn't even mind it.\" \"Perhaps put her in pull-ups,\" Eric suggested. \"That would make it easier.\" \"Yeah right I doubt she would wear them,\" Benny said. \"Well, at least there would be less laundry to do,\" said Eric. Back at their house, Joon was sitting at the kitchen table drawing something in her sketchbook. Mrs. Larkspur was there again watching her. Joon had twelve potty breaks a day but she always won because Mrs. Larkspur would give up on her. Mrs. Larkspur came in the kitchen. Right away, Joon could smell her because of her hair. \"Time for the bathroom,\" said Mrs. Larkspur. After she got near her, Joon told her to go away. \"It is time to use the bathroom,\" said her housekeeper. \"You're not my boss,\" said Joon. \"I am when your brother is away,\" yelled Mrs. Larkspur. \"Get away from me,\" Joon yelled. \"Not until you use the bathroom,\" Mrs. Larkspur yelled back. \"I said go away. Leave,\" and Joon pushed her away. Mrs. Larkspur has had it with her. She had violent behavior and she didn't listen what she told her to do and she had outbursts. Ms. Larkspur called Benny on the phone and told her she has had it so she was quitting her job. Benny hung up with a sad look on his face. \"Oh no,\" he groaned. \"What?\" Eric asked. \"We lost our housekeeper,\" Benny replied. He felt he had to leave early because Joon could do something dangerous such as leaving the house and causing disturbing things to other people or she could light something on fire and leave it and it could burn their house down. Benny told his assistant Eric, that he was in charge of the place now. Eric always took care of the place and was the vice boss of it while Benny was away. Benny took off his work gear and ran home to check on his sister. When he got there, he called her name but there was no answer. Benny started to get a little worried. He looked all over the house and the last room he looked in was her art studio. Then, there he saw her, outside throwing rocks in the river. She was trying to get them to skid across the water. Benny and Joon lived along Spokane River. Benny came outside to check on her. \"Hey, what happened between you and Mrs. Larkspur?\" he asked. \"She was being annoying,\" Joon replied, \"and she stinks too.\" \"She was not being annoying. It was her job to watch you while I'm at work,\" said Benny. Joon didn't care. At least the smelly housekeeper was gone for good.[Chapter 3] Benny and Joon were at the doctor's appointment the next day. Benny was in Dr. Garvey's office telling her about him losing a housekeeper because of Joon's behavior and anger and outbursts. Dr. Garvey was a black woman in her forties. \"We need to find another housekeeper,\" said Benny. \"Okay, I'll notify the hospital and other people in the city telling them you're looking for a housekeeper to watch Joon.\" \"Thank you Dr. Garvey,\" said Benny. Then it was Joon's turn to talk to her. Benny left the office and Joon went in. Joon had her sketchbook with her and her lunch pail she used as a carry case to store her art supplies in. Joon told her psychiatrist about Ms. Larkspur and how bad she smelled and how annoying she was. \"Joon, you have to do what your housekeeper tells you to do,\" said Dr. Garvey. \"That is part of your special needs.\" Joon knew that but she wanted to be her own boss. She wanted to do stuff on her own and make her own decisions like everybody else did. She wanted to grow up and she wanted to be a lady, not some helpless mentally ill woman who can't take care of herself. She could dress herself and brush her hair and brush her teeth but Benny did it all for her because he was too protective of her. He wouldn't let her do it on her own so only time she had the chance to do it by herself is when he is at work. She knew how to feed herself and make her own breakfast drink she had every morning and she could make herself a sandwich. She could do a lot of things. She was very smart even though she is sick. After Joon was done with her session, Dr. Garvey told Benny about what Joon told her. \"Just let her try to take care of herself and let her try to use good judgment and the housekeeper will be there to watch her to make sure she doesn't do anything dangerous or other stuff she does.\" \"Okay, I'll try that,\" said Benny. Soon he was at work. Joon was home alone again and Benny called her every fifteen minutes to make sure she was okay. \"Benny, try not to worry so much about her,\" said Eric. \"I can't, she might do something she is not supposed to do,\" said Benny. \"She lights things on fire, she wets and messes her pants, she wanders away from our home and causes disturbing things in public like I can remember the time last summer. Joon left the house and wandered off to Riverfront Park and it was hot out around ninety-degrees so she took of her clothes leaving on her bra and underwear and she waded her feet in the river and people stared at her and before I knew it, I got a call from the Spokane police officer telling me she was in the park naked wading in the river so I had to leave work and get her and bring her back home and I stayed home for the rest of the day.\" \"Maybe it's time you put her in a group home,\" Eric suggested. \"Yeah right,\" Benny said sarcastically. He couldn't bear to put his sister in a group home. What would their parents think if he did? He was her brother and it was his job to take care of her because he is her only family. No one else.[Chapter 4] Five days later, Benny had found another housekeeper thanks to his other friend, Thomas. Thomas worked at the hospital as an orderly. He washed clothes and floors and he cleaned bathrooms and hospital rooms. Mrs. Piltz arrived at their house on Monday. Benny told her about Joon and how crazy she is. \"Make sure she uses the bathroom twelve time a day because she tends to have accidents,\" he said. After he left, Joon was in the studio painting. She was painting a person being in a park and having a great time. Then she decided it was time for her breakfast drink. She put the paintbrush down and went in the kitchen. Joon took the milk and peanut butter out of the fridge. She set them on the counter and took the Capt N' Crunch that was sitting on top of the refrigerator. She put it with the milk and peanut butter and took out a big spoon out of the drawer and took the blender off the counter top. She brought them over to the spot where she always made her drink. She poured the non-fat milk into the blender and then she took out a spoonful of peanut butter and put it in too and then the Capt N' Crunch. Joon always had that drink every morning. She always used nonfat milk and the peanut butter super chunks and the Capt N' Crunch. Joon never used other kind of milk or peanut butter or cereal. She put the lid on the blender and turned it on. The ingredients blended together and then she turned it off and took the lid off. She poured it in a glass and drank it. Mrs. Piltz was standing in the doorway of the kitchen watching her. She came in the kitchen when she first heard the blender go off. Mrs. Piltz was grossed out by the drink Joon made, and she was even more grossed out when she drank it. After Joon had her drink, she went back in the studio to paint. Mrs. Piltz didn't bother to tell Joon to put the stuff away because Benny told her to let her do her routine and not bother her about it. Thirty minutes later, Mrs. Piltz came in the studio to take Joon to the bathroom. \"Time to use the bathroom,\" she said. Joon ignored her. She just stared at her painting. \"Juniper,\" said Mrs. Piltz. Joon was bothered by her being in the studio because she couldn't concentrate on her painting. Mrs. Piltz walked up to Joon and grabbed the paintbrush from her. Joon gripped onto it. \"You can finish your painting after you use the bathroom,\" said Mrs. Piltz but Joon didn't listen. She didn't need to use the bathroom. She went after she got up. \"Let go,\" she said. \"Put the paintbrush down,\" said Mrs. Piltz, \"and I will let go.\" Joon put it down. \"Now, come with me,\" said her housekeeper. Joon followed her and up the stairs to the bathroom. Mrs. Piltz was about to grab Joon's Pants but she slapped her arm away and did it herself. She pulled down her underwear and sat on the toilet. After one second, she got up. \"No, you stay on it,\" said Mrs. Piltz as she grabbed Joon by the shoulders. \"That wasn't long enough.\" After five seconds, Joon tried to get up again but Mrs. Piltz stopped her. \"Not until you use the potty,\" but Joon started to get a little violent. \"You're hurting me,\" she yelled. \"Let go.\" \"Promise you will stay on the toilet bowl?\" said Mrs. Piltz. Joon stopped her attack but after she let go, Joon shot up in the air and ran out of the bathroom. \"Juniper Pearl, you get back here right now young lady!\" Mrs. Piltz yelled. Joon ran back to her studio and closed the door and kept on painting.[Chapter 5] Three days had gone by and Joon had gotten worse. She stopped going to the bathroom when she was told to by Mrs. Piltz, and she started to get very angry easily and she would have delusions in her mind. She would talk to her herself and yell because she would hear voices that weren't real and she knew it but she couldn't help herself. Mrs. Piltz was sitting in the living room hearing her yell. \"Shut up!\" Joon was yelling. \"I can't hear you.\" Mrs. Piltz didn't do anything about it because she was informed by Benny that when she talks to herself, ignore it. It's part of her illness. Soon, it was time for her to get Joon to use the bathroom again. Mrs. Piltz got out of the chair and went into the art studio. \"Time, to use the bathroom,\" she said. Joon ignored her but she was annoyed. \"Joon, please, c'mon, you need to go.\" Joon picked up a jar of paint and threw it at her. The lid flew open and the paint fell on Mrs. Piltz dress and she gasped. Benny was at a friend's house playing poker with his friends. Instead of betting on money, they betted on stuff. Each of them brought some stuff over with them they didn't want and they would bet on them. Whoever won, got to take the item. \"Weird Al Yankovic album,\" Mike told Benny. Mike was another friend of Benny's in his thirties. \"Who is that person?\" Thomas asked. \"He's a parody singer,\" Mike replied. \"He changes the words to songs to make it funny.\" \"Fishing pole,\" said Eric. \"Billie Holiday album,\" said Benny. \"Wooden baseball bat,\" said Thomas. Then the phone rang. Eric got up to answer it. \"Hello,\" he said. \"Yes it is. What--oh you want Benny, okay.\" Eric got off the phone. \"Benny, it's for you.\" \"Oh no,\" Benny sighed as he got out of his chair. He knew it was Mrs. Piltz because he had given her the phone number of his friend's place just in case there were any problems with Joon. Benny took the phone from Eric. \"Yes?\" \"Mr. Pearl I'm sorry, I can't watch your sister anymore,\" Mrs. Piltz was sobbing. \"She threw paint on me when I was trying to get her to use the bathroom and now my dress is covered with it.\" Benny knew she was quitting her job. There goes another housekeeper. After he hung up, he told all his friends he had to go. Benny turned his cards over to end the game. \"Full house,\" he said as he put his cards down. Mike had lost. Benny took the Weird Al Yankovic album off the table and left.[Chapter 6] In the past two weeks, Benny's has had two more housekeepers and they had already quit. Joon was still wetting herself. One day she messed her panties and she spread it around by sitting in it. Benny came into the room and smelled the mess. He picked up the phone to call Thomas. He answered it and Benny asked him if he's found another person who wants to be a housekeeper. \"I've found a few and they're willing to watch your sister,\" Thomas said. \"Okay. Good. I can't wait to meet them. My life has been really complicated.\" \"What happened?\" \"Joon soiled her pants,\" Benny replied. \"Benny, I think it's time she wears diapers now since she can't seem to stop having accidents.\" \"Diapers?\" said Benny. \"Yes diapers. They are for people who can't go to the bathroom and Joon seems like she is unable to, so she'll need protection.\" \"How am I going to get her to wear diapers?\" \"I don't know but it's worth a try.\" \"Is there a better idea I can do?\" Benny asked. \"Diapers is all I can think of but at least you wouldn't be doing much laundry like you do now.\" \"Okay, I'll try that, thanks.\" After he hung up, Benny went back in the laundry room to check on the clothes. They were still washing. Tomorrow he would have to wash Joon's sheets and blanket. He still wasn't sure if he should put her in diapers. Benny kept thinking about the diapers for the past three days. He had a new housekeeper again and Joon still didn't use the bathroom. She still went in her underwear and she soiled in one of them again. Benny decided it was time to take Thomas's advice. Maybe he should have her wear diapers. He went to Rosauer'sas he came home from work. The first thing he did was he went looking for diapers. He found them next to the pads. He picked one up and looked at it. He read the back of the package and they sounded like good diapers. He looked at the size and it said L. Benny put it back and went for a size medium. He picked up two packages of them and put them in the cart. Next thing he needed was more shaving cream and razor blades. He got them from the beauty aisle and he got some more things he needed and went to the checkout counter. He unloaded the cart and the counter clerk began to scan the merchandise across the beeping thing and putting them in a paper bag. After she was done, she told Benny the total. Benny opened his wallet and took out his cash and gaveit to her. The lady put it in the cash register and gave change back to him. Benny ended up with two paper bags because the diapers took up a lot of space so there was no more room so the lady had to put the stuff in another paper sack. Benny picked them up and left the store. He came rushing home. He went in his yard and went in through the side door. Benny had to put one of the sacks down to open the door. He and Joon never used the front door. The side door and the front door were on the same porch. The housekeeper, Mrs. Luddkee came up to Benny as he set one of the paper sacks on the island in the kitchen. \"Thank god you came home,\" she said. \"I have a problem, I couldn't get Joon to use the bathroom, she would get mad when I try to make her. It seems like she wets and messes herself on purpose. She never wants to use the bathroom and I think she likes doing it in her pants.\" Benny didn't believeher. It was just her perspectiveve. Joon wasn't doing it intentionally, was she? \"Don't worry, I think this might be your last time to deal with potty training,\" Benny told her. Mrs. Luddkee shot a look on her face. \"I'm not firing you,\" said Benny, \"You'll see when you come back tomorrow.\" After the housekeeper left, Benny went upstairs to Joon's room with the diapers and baby wipes. He set the wipes down and took the diapers out of the paper bag. \"Joon I have to tell you something.\" Joon looked up from her book. Benny showed her the diapers. \"Why do you have those?\" she asked. \"That's what I'm going to tell you about. Look, I know you have been wetting your pants and making messes in them and I'm tired of cleaning it up and I'm tired of washing your sheets so you're going to wear these.\" Joon shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"No I won't.\" \"Joon, this is not to punish you, this is too make it easier for you and me.\" \"I am not going to wear those,\" she said. \"Yes you are.\" \"No I am not. I'm twenty-four-years old. What do I look like, an old person?\" \"No, you're not but you have been having accidents,\" Benny pointed out. \"But those are for old people and I am not an old person. I am a young lady.\" \"Diapers are not necessarily for old people,\" Benny explained. \"When people say that, they're wrong. They are also for people who keep wetting themselves just like you do.\" \"But I don't mean to do it,\" said Joon. \"Those are accidents.\" \"I know but people who can't control their bowels or bladder wear them so they don't keep on having accidents in their pants.\" Then an idea came to Benny's head. \"I'll tell you what, what if I put one on too, would you wear one with me?\" \"Benny?\" \"It might be fun, you never know.\" Benny opened the package and took out a diaper. \"Just think Joon, if you wear diapers, you won't have wet pants again or messy ones and you won't have to clean it up.\" \"You still do when you're wearing them.\" Benny sighed. He didn't want to push her into wearing them because he didn't want to make her mad. Benny left with the diaper in his hand. He set it down in his room and went downstairs. Benny unpacked the grocery bag. He took out his shaving cream and razor blades and put them upstairs in the bathroom. He went back downstairs and made some dinner. After he was done, he called Joon to come down. Joon put her book down and came downstairs. Benny put food on the table with the mustard and ketchup. Joon sat down. For dinner they were having hamburgers and fries. Joon only liked plain hamburgers. She took out a hamburger bun and put one of the hamburger meats on it and then she put some fries on her plate. After Joon was done eating, she left the kitchen. Joon didn't even clear her spot. She never did and Benny never bothered her about it because he lets he go her routine. Routine was very important to her and if he didn't let her go her way, she would get mad and have outbursts. Benny cleaned up the kitchen after he was done eating. He headed upstairs after he was through. He went in his room and took off his pants. He picked up the diaper and put it on over his underwear and then he went into Joon's room. Joon was lying on her bed. She was wearing a white dress that had some blue on it. Joon sometimes wore her clothes to bed, sometimes her shoes too. Joon started to laugh when she saw Benny wearing only his t-shirt and diaper. She thought her brother looked funny wearing it. \"Are you going to wear one too?\" he asked. \"Not in a million years,\" Joon replied. \"C'mon, I'm already enjoying the diaper already.\" The diaper felt really soft and secured. Benny didn't even want to take it off. He was just trying to get Joon to wear them. Benny walked around the room. The diaper crinkled as he walked. \"Those things make a lot of noise,\" said Joon. \"I don't think I can ever go out with one on.\" \"If you stop wetting your pants and messing them, you won't have to wear them anymore,\" said Benny, \"and by the way, I'm done washing your sheets everyday, now I'm going to do it once a week now. End of story.\" Benny left her bedroom and went in his room. He hoped he got Joon to finally wear one of what he said to her but he doubt it would work. He had done that stuff many times before and Joon was not that dumb not to figure out he was lying to her. Benny lied on his bed and said 'goodnight' to his goldfish, Steve, and turned off his lamp. Back in Joon's bedroom, Joon was wondering what was like to wear a diaper and how babies and elderly feel about wearing them. Then she decided she was going to pretend she is just an old woman who can't take care of herself and she can't go to the bathroom. Joon crawled out of bed and took off her dress and her underwear. She took one of the diapers out of the open package. She unfolded it and put it on. It felt soft and comfy. The diaper crinkled as she moved around. She put her dress back on and crawled back under the covers.[Chapter 7] Joon woke up the next morning in a wet diaper but she didn't remember using it. She woke up and used the bathroom and then she realized, wait a minute. She woke up and went to the bathroom and lifted her dress and pulled down her panties and sat on the toilet and went but she was wearing a diaper so how can she possibly use the bathroom in the middle of the night without wearing the diaper? She has no underwear on. Joon liked the feeling of wearing a diaper. She liked how it felt and how warm it is from the pee but it stunk. Joon got out of bed and took off her dress and her wet diaper. Her bottom stunk like pee. Joon tore the plastic off the wipes container. She lifted up the lid and took out a wipe and wiped herself down there. She put on another diaper and went to her closet and took out one of her other dresses. She put it on and went downstairs with the diaper. She threw it away and went in the studio to paint. In Benny's bedroom, he woke up in a wet diaper too. He got up in the middle of the night and used it just to see what it was like and he liked it. Benny didn't want to take the diaper off. He wanted to leave it on but what if someone at work noticed it and what would they think if they did? Benny got out of bed and took out a clean pair of underwear and a clean shirt and pants and went to the bathroom to shower. He set his clothes on the toilet and took off his wet diaper and underwear. He set them on the floor and showered. After he was done, he shaved and got dressed. He combed his hair and fed his fish. Benny went downstairs with his dirty diaper and underwear. He put the underwear in the laundry and the diaper in the trash in the kitchen but he noticed there was another diaper in there and it was wet. Benny wondered if Joon wore the diaper? \"Joon?\" he called. He went in the studio and saw her painting. She was wearing a long purple dress that came down to her legs below her knees. \"Did you wear a diaper?\" Benny asked. \"Yes,\" she said, \"and it felt great. I was sleeping and the diaper was dry and I woke up and it was wet. It was really wet. I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom but I was wearing my underwear and it's really confusing.\" \"What's confusing?\" Benny asked. \"I was wearing underwear when I got up in the middle of the night to go but I put the diaper on last night before I went to sleep so I don't know why I had underwear on.\" \"Joon, you going to the bathroom; but the truth is, you really aren't going,\" Benny explained. \"It's all in your head so that is why you have accidents and that is why I have you use the bathroom twelve times a day. I'll get you your meds.\" Benny left the studio and got out Joon's pills. He poured a glass of water and went back in the studio. Everyday, Joon took her medicine for her illness. Benny opened up the pill container and poured a couple pills in his hand and gave them to Joon. Joon put them in her mouth and Benny gave her the glass of water. After Joon took her meds, Benny took the glass from her. \"Are you wearing a diaper now?\" he asked. He felt her bottom and he could feel the diaper. Benny left the studio and had some breakfast. Soon Mrs. Luddkee arrived again. Benny told her she doesn't have to worry about taking Joon to the bathroom anymore because she is now in diapers so she would have to diaper check her to make sure she is wet or dry. \"When she is wet or messy, she would need a change,\" Benny told Mrs. Luddkee. Mrs. Luddkee was grossed out by that situation. She couldn't believe she would be changing a grown up. Would Joon let her change her? After Benny left, Joon went in the kitchen and made her breakfast drink. Joon poured the Capt N' Crunch in the blender with her non-fat milk and peanut butter super chunks. Joon put the lid on and turned it on. The ingredients blended together and Joon turned it off and took the lid off. She poured it in a glass and drank it as she walked back to the studio. A few days had gone by and Benny had been wearing diapers too. He liked the way they felt on him. One day he decided to solve the problem for potty breaks during poker. He decided he and his friends all should wear diapers while they play so there wouldn't be any potty breaks but they all protested. \"C'mon Joon wears them and she doesn't mind it,\" said Benny. \"Of course she doesn't,\" said Mike. \"She's sick so she doesn't know the difference.\" \"Well at least my life is a little less complicated now,\" and then he made a bet to all his friends to wear diapers from now on when they're playing poker. All his friends tried real hard not to lose or they would end up in diapers from now on. They all tried to bluff so they can win but Mike lost first. \"This is just wonderful Benny,\" he said sarcastically. He knew he was going to have to wear diapers from now on while they play but where were the diapers. Benny didn't even bring any. Was he bluffing about it? \"Where are the diapers, Benny?\" Mike asked. \"Mike, just stop,\" said Thomas. \"Don't bring you bad attitude here. Lets just enjoy playing, okay?\" Eric got up from his chair. \"I need to use the bathroom so I'll be right back.\" \"That's why I suggested we all shall wear diapers while we're playing,\" said Benny. \"That doesn't matter right now,\" said Thomas. \"The game is over. You have won Benny,\" and then he looked at Mike, \"What could be bad about wearing diapers. Its not like you have to go to the bathroom in them anyway. It's just a harmless bet. What could possibly go wrong?\" Eric came back to the table and sat down in his lawn chair. Benny and all his friends played poker on the screen porch. Benny shuffled the cards and passed them out again as Mike wrote something in his notepad and tore it off. He decided he wanted to go first, \"No wearing diapers while playing poker,\" he told everyone while he put the notepaper in the middle of the table. \"I say yes to wearing diapers,\" said Benny as he placed his bet in the middle of the table. They all played poker for about fifteen minutes then the game ended. Eric had won the game and Benny had to be Eric's slave for a week at Benny's Car Clinic.[Chapter 8] Benny brought a package of unopened diapers to Eric's house the next time they played poker. He opened the package and pulled out a diaper. Everyone stared at it, even Claudia but she didn't say a thing. Claudia was Eric's wife but she never spoke because she was deaf. \"I have to wear those?\" Mike complained. \"I'm grossed out by this.\" \"I'm used to seeing them,\" said Thomas, \"Because I deal with them at work.\" No kidding. There had came times when he had to rinse them out because they were cloth ones, not disposables. Benny did a demo by taking off his pants in front of all his friends. Claudia left the room just as Benny pulled down his underwear. He put on the diaper and pulled his pants and underwear back up. His diaper crinkled as he took a few steps. \"Those things are noisy,\" said Mike. \"At least we're not in public,\" said Eric. \"Hand me a diaper.\" \"Ew I'm not touching them,\" said Mike. \"Those things gross me out.\" \"They're in the package, help yourself,\" said Benny. Eric took a diaper out of the package and then Thomas. \"You guys are crazy,\" Mike whined. \"Put one on too, Mike,\" said Eric. \"No way, those are for old people.\" \"Fine, no diaper, you're not playing with us.\" Mike sat out while the others played. Benny took a little leak in his diaper and then he announced it to Eric and Thomas. Mike was real disgusted when he heard it. \"You guys are pathetic,\" he said. \"I'm out of here.\" Mike left Eric's house in his car and he didn't come back till the next poker game. This time, Eric, Thomas, Benny, Joon were standing on the screen porch. Benny told Joon to come with him to Eric's house because he and his friends' might need her help. They were all standing waiting for Mike to show up. Benny held a clean diaper in his hand. A few minutes later, Mike pulled into Eric's driveway and parked his car. He got out and locked it and went inside. When he arrived in the room, he saw all his friends and Joon standing next to them. Claudia was sitting at the bar working on a word search. \"Okay Mike, are you ready?\" Benny asked. \"What's going on?\" Mike asked. \"You are going to wear the diaper,\" Benny replied. Eric walked behind Mike to block the door. \"I'm not wearing that thing,\" said Mike. \"Joon, you know what to do right?\" Benny asked her. \"Yes,\" she replied. Benny, Eric, and Thomas had already explained to her what they were going to do to him. \"This is weird, I'm out of here,\" said Mike but when he turned around, he couldn't get out because Eric was blocking the door. Mike turned his body to walk the other way but Benny blocked that way too and then Thomas and Joon grabbed him. Mike slammed his elbow in Joon's hip. \"Hey, don't you hit my sister,\" Benny yelled. \"Let go of me,\" Mike yelled. Joon climbed on him and then Benny, Eric, and Thomas forced him on the floor. Joon sat on top of Mike. Mike could smell her diaper because she peed in it a couple times. Eric had a hold of Mike's hands and Thomas had a hold of his legs. Benny pulled down his pants and underwear. \"I can charge all four of you with sexual abuse,\" Mike yelled. Eric lifted up his legs and Benny unfolded the diaper and slid it under his bum. Mike kept yelling. \"Joon, will you cover his mouth,\" said Benny, \"He's giving me a headache.\" Joon put her hand on Mike's mouth. He couldn't yell anymore, now he made muffling sounds. Benny pulled the diaper up between Mike's legs and taped it shut. Mike stopped muffling when he felt how nice the diaper felt. It was soft around his skin. Then he started to have an erection. Benny noticed it happening and so did Thomas. \"Well it looks like you're enjoying the diaper already, Mike,\" said Benny. Mike felt embarrassed. \"Joon, you can uncover his mouth now,\" said Benny. Joon uncovered his mouth and got off him. She went in the corner of the room and put a load in her diaper and sighed with relief after getting rid of those cramps. Mike started to cry. Thomas asked him what's wrong and Mike told him he was real embarrassed of the whole scene. All of his friends comforted him and told him everything was okay. When Joon walked towards them, Benny noticed Joon had crapped herself. \"Okay Joon, time for a diaper change,\" he said. Benny took her out of the room by her hand and brought her to the family room. He had her lay on the couch while he went out to his car to get her a fresh diaper and of course wipes. He went back inside and set them on the couch. \"Lift up your dress,\" he told her. Joon lifted up her dress but Benny made sure all of it was out of the way. He pulled it all the way up to her tummy. He pulled the tabs on her diaper and opened it and saw how soaked it was because it was all yellow. As Benny was wiping her, Thomas came in and said they were about to began poker and then he stayed in the room. Joon pulled her dress over her bottom. \"Thomas, would mind giving us some privacy here?\" Benny said firmly. \"Okay, jeas sorry,\" he said left. Joon lifted her dress back up again. After Benny finished wiping her, he put a clean diaper under her bottom and pulled it up between her legs and taped it shut. \"There you go,\" he said. \"All nice and clean.\" Joon got up and her dress fell down to her knees and she left the room. Benny folded up the dirty diaper with the used wipes in it and threw it away. He went back to the screen porch but his friends had already started without him. Joon was wandering around the room because she had nothing to do. After they were done playing poker, Benny said he had to take Joon home because she was restless. He took the wipes out of the family room as he left the house. Joon got in the car with him and left. I almost forgot I also did some Mike bashing in this. Wow I hated him that much back then too.[Chapter 9] Benny and his friends wore diapers every time they played poker. They all enjoyed it very much but none of them knew Benny wore them most of the time when he's not playing poker. He changed Joon's diapers when he was home with her but one day Joon wanted to change his diaper but Benny told her 'no' and Joon told him \"Benjamin, you change my diapers, why can't I change yours?\" and he said \"Because I'm not sick like you,\" and Joon got mad. She was offended by that remark her brother made. Just because she was sick didn't mean she can't change diapers but Benny told her she can't change him or he might get in trouble by the law because they're siblings. \"You've been changing mine and you didn't even get in trouble at all,\" she yelled. \"That's because you're sick,\" Benny replied. Joon yelled at him telling him he is never ever changing her diapers ever again and that was the end of it. One day Benny was shocked that Joon knew how to change her own diapers because he found the dirty ones in the trash so he stopped worrying about her not knowing how to change her own. Joon even told him when she was running low on them too. Benny even started to wear them to work and one day, Eric noticed it and Benny was real embarrassed when he found out about his secret. Eric took him into the office and told him everything was okay. If he liked wearing diapers, its not hurting anyone and he promised him he wouldn't tell anyone, not even his wife and their friends so his secret was safe with him. \"So does Joon know you wear them?\" Eric asked. \"Yes she knows,\" Benny replied. \"At least you showed her a good example about diaper wearing and now she doesn't feel ashamed about them at all.\" \"Yeah and my life is a little less complicated too. She even changes her own.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah.\" \"That's great. At least the housekeepers wouldn't have to worry about changing her.\" After they were done having a private chitchat, they went back out in the garage to continue working on someone's car. One day Benny came home with a new diaper brand, Attends but he had the other brand too they usually wore just in case Joon did not like the idea of trying a new brand. Benny decided the diapers he wore weren't good enough so he went to a medical supply store and got a package of Attends because the lady who worked there told him they hold more than Depends and the store brands. Benny came home with the diapers. He showed them to Joon. He told her they held more than the ones she wore and if she doesn't like them, she can go back to the other brand. When Joon needed to change her diaper, she tried the new brand and she noticed they were thicker and they felt nicer. She noticed they held more too after she peed in them a few times. She liked them better than the other kinds she wore, whenever she ran low on diapers, she would tell Benny to get more Attends and Benny also stuck with them too because they were better than the other ones they wore and Benny and his friends wore the new brand too while they played poker and it never changed.

I'm that kind of guy who makes friends online, keeps them online and when forced to meet them face to face spends the whole time regretting the beautiful connection he had when he wasn't obliged to actually join the conversation. I'm that kind of guy who isn't shy, isn't emotionless: just existentially bored by human bullshit. \" Wrong. \" My voice declared. \"During the Crash of '29 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%. Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited.\" \"And who the hell are you, kid?\" \"When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, which could not be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and yada yada yada. It's called Wikipedia, sir.\" The room fell in a quiet and most appreciated stage of peace. A little bit of silence, thank God. After all, my ears were literally pounding. I got to the point I couldn't even focus on the my own thoughts running across my brain. Yes, because I'm also the kind of guy who zones out so many times he's created his own autopilot technique. But for once my autopilot had failed me. That bastard. \"First of all, sir.\" I started clarifying without even taking a break from pressing the fingertips on my phone keyboard. \"I am not a kid '. Thank you.\" \"That's…\" \"Second: if my son was doing an internship at Google, I may – but I say may- consider being slightly more likely to look up the bullshit I wanna use to threat him right on the search engine my kid's probably gonna work with for the rest of his life. And third, to answer your question, sir: who am I? I'm that kind of guy who has a very low breaking point for dolled up douche bags and, thanks to you, he has just reached it.\" Silence again. I had been laying on one of the highest bench, on the left corner of the bleachers, for more than a couple of hours now. Haven't even moved a muscle. Just been exploring the virtual globe through the small display of my iphone, shoes off and head on a comfy pillow. That had been until someone had broken into my bubble of isolation and shattered it into millions of pieces. No headphones could have possibility protected me from the storm of angry words suddenly bursting into the room. I had peeped the source of the anger and found myself amused. Then time passed, more words came out. And amusement was followed by confusion. Much more time, many more words: confusion was followed by discomfort, discomfort was followed by embarrassment, by bitterness, offence, exasperation...What the…? \"Why don't you make yourself a favour and finish your masturbation session somewhere else, kid. We're in the middle of a discussion here.\" His Hitler-styleD voice was really getting to my nerves. \"Why don't you give the forty districts of San Francisco a rest and finish your 'discussion' after two litres of camomile and a cold shower, pal.\" I shot back, not even bothering looking at him. \"There're people loosing their hearing here.\" \"I didn't know raising a little bit a voice was a crime.\" \"No shit.\" \"I'm gonna tell you something, kid.\" The man began, passing from threatening to patronizing in the blink of an eye. \"Try spending a little less time on Twitter and more time learning valid lessons of respect for the elders. Am I understood.\" \"What a great piece of advice from someone who's been yelling like a monkey in the middle of a meeting room at almost midnight.\" \"Who are you, the Google volume police service?\" No idea if I was more annoyed or entertained by then: \"You can call me that, yeah. \" I giggled. \"And I'm thinking to call you the man who made Graham Hewtrey the motherfucker he is today.\" \"Glad you've met my son.\"he laughed. \"And now what about moving to another room so that Graham and I can finish our little meeting, thank you and have a nice evening.\" Sure, I could have simply wriggled out of there leaving the two of them at their family reunion. It was actually fairly unusual for me to get involved in something that was clearly outside of my jurisdiction. Was it empathy for Graham, for all the energy his dad was putting into a speech that hadn't any other goal but humiliate his own son? Naah: no way. Maybe I was just fed up with the fact that my moment of peace and quiet had been destroyed by two generations of dickheads. That being said, one thing was certain: the bastard wasn't going to quit. And neither was I. So after switching my phone off and brutally fired my autopilot – which, by the way, was definitely in need of a serious inspection- I finally sat up. And finally gave a long, big look at them. Midnight. The darkness was almost full - not to my surprise, since that was the exact reason I chose that room in the first place. The only colourful light that cleared the outlines of the objects was coming from a wave of small light bulbs chaotically spread on the pavement above us. But I didn't need a lighthouse to realize that who was standing in the centre of the room was one taught of a daddy. Graham and he had a lot in common: same black curly hair, same stubborn jaw, fake aristocratic attitude and that sugary Harry Potter accent that literally drove me crazy- in the very bad way. Mister Hawtrey was a tall, muscular oak, elegantly wrapped up in a beige dust coat from some cheap movie from the eighties. His expensive pair of shoes matched his branded pair of trousers and piercing pair of eyes icily pointed at my direction. Face of a surgeon, possibly. Or of a body-building trainer. Graham was, instead, a little less polished than usual. He was wearing jeans and a gray sloppy t-shirt; his entire figure was tired and messy as he had been caught in the middle of a nightmare. He hadn't spoken once since his dad started the vicious pep talk. \"No honestly: do you believe your son is deaf or something?\" I snorted looking at him. \"Which would be quite understandable, seen you ability to go ultrasound, but…You know, I personally think after the tenth time you've kindly highlighted how much of a loser he is, we all have quite got the point- he and I and the forty districts of San Francisco.\" He was trying to murder me with his snotty stare, it was sure: \"This is really none of your business.\" \"Very true.\" I agreed, finally standing up. \"In fact my only business consists in working my ass off to pass an internship that's gonna lead me eventually to a job in one of the richest company in the United States of America. And so does you son's.\" I was peacefully strolling down the stairs, now, hands in the pockets of my jeans and a big, fat smile printed on my lips. \"So here's my advice to you, mister Hawtrey: back off and let us focus on what we do best. We're here to work.\" He laughed: \"You know what? You are most definitely right, my friend. This is what I've been trying to tell my son…\"and he turned towards Graham smiling. \"Who apparently lacks the ability to catch the meaning of one tiny word.\" \"Asshole? He got that, trust me.\" \"… Success .\" My step fell on the floor. The man seamed even taller and bulgier from there, but it was too late for me to surrender anyway. So I kept on walking in their direction, while mister Hewtrey pepped his son on the back, joyfully exclaiming: \"I want him to be the best he can be. I want him to strive, to make his family proud, I want him to be…\" And my heartbeat stopped. Just stopped. I'm serious, it must have been the most bizarre feeling I'd ever felt in my life. The man kept on talking bullshit and I couldn't understand a word as too busy grasping air into my lungs and pumping blood into my veins. Don't get me wrong, it was nothing like a was hit by missile attack or an alien invasion, it's just that I usually…I don't. I'm that kind of guy who does not connect with people, right? Never. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I care about someone, it always seem I don't care enough . Yes, your honour, I am incapable of experiencing a true real bond with somebody else but the voice control on my phone. …So how the hell was possible that just one stupid eye contact could have made me feel what Graham was really feeling? Tell me. It happened fast and creepy, just the time to get overwhelmed with a sense of such frustration I got the sudden urge to scream out as loud as I possibly could. It may sound absurd but trust me: no alien invasion could ever measure up to that. I looked away, rapidly cleared my throat: \"Yeah very exciting, sir, but what about what the guy wants?\" Meanwhile I was getting closer and closer to them. \"Graham clearly wants all this.\" he stated, rounding Graham's shoulders with his arm. \"Everyone likes being the best, don't they?\" \"What if Graham's not 'everyone'.\" \"I don't even know what you're trying to imply, my friend. But can we speak frankly?\" \"Were we not already?\" \"I don't give a damn.\" \"Right.\" I nodded. \"Then sir you can begin packing your shit, turning around and running back to wherever infernal hole you come from before I decide to move my hand off my dick and call someone who will be most enthusiastic to kick you out of here.\" \"Oh my.\" The man's voice sarcastically sighed, watching me getting closer. \"The kid really thinks I can feel intimidated by a sixteen years old geek who spends his days watching porn in his dorm.\" \"This is not your playground, mister Hawtrey.\" \"Look at that: he's good, he's really good.\" \"And you haven't seen the best part yet.\" \"I'm starting to fear you got a gun in the back of your belt.\" \"Almost.\" I smirked. \"I got something better.\" My fingers pulled out the phone like a rifle. I was tempted to charge it but I forgot it didn't have a trigger. Nevertheless, I handled it like it was ready to shoot and lifted it in air until I got the phone keyboard two millimetres from my thumb: \"One call, Mister Hawtrey.\" \"Uuuh the call threat.\" \"The call threat, exactly.\" I repeated. \"You want me to count to three, just to step some pressure up?\" \"You've clearly watched too much television, son.\" \"One.\"I started. A laugh. \"Two.\" He was shaking his head. The next words came in a whisper: \"You little, sad, nerdy punk.\" \"Well now we know where Graham took his charming attitude, don't we.\" I was right in front of him by then. It felt like standing in the middle of the combat radius of a fire-breathing dragon, but who cared. At that point nothing mattered more than pissing him off till the moment he realized I wasn't worthy all the fuss. And that moment came sooner than expected. To my surprise, all of a sudden he turned towards his son with a finger pointed at him: \"Call me. Tomorrow.\" Graham didn't answer. Last murdering shot at my innocent smile, last nasty comment I didn't even cared to register and he was gone. Puff. Vanished in a cloud of condescendence. Mission accomplished. I felt ecstatic. Now I could finally enjoy the rest of the night, now I could 000 , that was it, that was the end, everything would have come back to normal, everything was boring and stupid as always, right?, everything was...! Wrong. Because what followed was the real tricky part. Now that the former enemy was gone, the whole thing came out as a even-not-that-funny joke: me protecting the bad guy of the story from his evil father? Drawing my enchanted sword to save the poor damsel in distress, what the f…? Suddenly looking at Graham seemed a little too hard for me. So I decided to bring my peace and quite to my room, coldly mumble something like \"you're welcome\" and take off. I was already ten feet away from him when his voice reached me.[Chapter 2] A/N Again: every time you spot a language mistake, please don't hesitate to tell me! For the rest, thank you so much for reading and I can't wait to know what you guys think about this chapter ;) CHAPTER 2 \"Googliness\" \"What now, you want a medal?\" I slowed down, then stopped. Licked my lips. Carefully weighting the next move. Not that I was actually expecting a Mexican wave, but his tone stung a bit too much and I wasn't in the best mood to get over my pride without giving him a ration of my favourite fuck-you-all look. After all, I had just spared him another two hours of acoustic harassment. He owed me big time, no matter how he wanted to put it. So I turned to face him. Fuck-you-all look on. \"You gotta be kidding me.\" Graham had a fist on his hip and the other hand tensely scrubbing the back of his neck. His face was pale enough to look like he had been fighting an entire army. Which was pretty close to reality, from his perspective. Whereas from my perspective it was like watching a girlfriend without make up on: vaguely familiar. A bit pathetic. And kind of sweet, goddamn it, that type of sweetness that manages to make you feel guilty just for perceiving it. \"Let's be clear on this okay, uhm…Tom? Sean?\" \"Stuart.\" \"Brilliant. Stuart?\" he hissed, waving his hand in the air. \"I am not a charity case.\" \"Good, 'cause I don't usually save charity cases' butt.\" I replied ironically. \"I prefer the one whose been picking on my team since the very first moment we stepped in this goddamn place.\" \"My my, you really are a kid.\" he scoffed. \"I bet you're the mommy little angel.\" \"Jealous much?\" The corner of his lips twitched. Bang: I hurt him. \"Hey, little angel, you wanna play tag with your friends? Go back to kindergarten.\" He snarled. \"This is a com-pe-ti-tion . If you wanna win there's only two things you can do: win. And win. So sorry to bring that to you, but the candy store is out of business.\" Sarcasm, yuhoo. My oldest friend. I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty odd to find ourselves duelling on a common ground of bitter, icy, uptight contempt. Half of my life essentially consists in restraining myself from hitting too low, but this? This was my gateway for low blows. \"Is this what you tell yourself to go to sleep at night?\" I snorted, amused and imperceptibly getting closer to him. \"Or maybe it's the reason you're too fucking embarrassed to say one little thank you.\" \"You getting into my private business is a lot of things, Sean, but definitely not something I will ever be thankful for.\" \"It's Stuart . \" \"I don't need another pretentious nosy parker snooping around my life, thank you. That position has already been filled.\" \"Well now don't cry.\" \"No risk.\" \"You sure?\" He shot me a glance literally in flames- I thought my fingerprints were starting to self-combust. Pretty convincing, yet I knew he was crumbling. That was probably the reason why I couldn't just punch him in the nose or leave without much of a goodbye- thought both options were significantly tempting. I knew he was crumbling and I knew I had the power to help him out… on the way to self-destruction. I was just cautiously considering whereas giving him the final straw or let myself enjoy the view of his slow bleeding to death. \"Not my fault your dad's a jerk, jerk.\" I noted, stopping right in front of him and facing his egotistical expression like I'd done with his father's just a few minutes before. \"Next time keep him on leash.\" Silence. Sweet, triumphant silence. And the staring contest began. There he was: the jackass, the villain, now frantically holding on the pieces of his impenetrable mask while visibly crushing under the strength of my contemptuous smile. And there I was, the good guy, the man who saved the day by sacrificing precious time spendable in much more productive activities like the Angry Birds championship I had to suspend in order to pull his rival out of – Alright, fine, my mind is a bit of a drama queen when it comes to depicting scenes. I guess it's the price you pay for dabbling in massively multiplayer online role-playing games all set in violent époques in which nobody seems to catch the meaning of negotiation. Not that my virtual military experience mattered much, at one point. And you know why? Because he quit. He quit. Just like that. In a matter of seconds, while my mind was still busy keeping the theatrical soliloquy echoing across my head, Graham wearily slipped away from the tight grip of my eyes and turned his back at me, merely waving two fingers in a tired salute of defeat. The victory tasted funny on my tongue, but hey. I WON. All of a sudden my chest got literally overwhelmed with satisfaction, like a roman emperor returning victorious after one of the most arduous campaigns of his life. God that felt so good. It was huge, I may have even earned myself the opportunity to start blackmailing him from that moment on, I could have contacted his daddy right the next morning, inflamed him a little – how hard could have that been?- and placidly let him torturing his son until Graham's mental health was so messed up he couldn't even get up from bed. Look at him, he was already on the road to complete self-disintegration. The way he took careful distant from me, without even the courage to peek at where I was standing…He. Was. Pathetic. I gave him one week. In seven days maximum the villain of the story was out of the game, for good. … and there he was: our all time favourite good guy… Thank you, thank you: you're too kind …both prey and mighty master of his unmerited destiny …Well that's me, what can I say …now sneakily setting up the perfect plan to eliminate his rival in the most vicious and merciless… Wait, what?... to crush his enemy to his very core… No, listen… regardless of any …This is not… cruel, ruthless, devious … Okay now stop it, seriously… just to get himself the final prize …Hey shut up! And so it hit me. The funny taste thingy: it didn't feel like I won. It felt like his douche bag of a father won. It wasn't me who was enjoying the way he let himself fall on the first raw of the bleachers, temples in the palms of his hands, so vulnerable it was embarrassing; it wasn't me who was exulting inside because yes, I made it, I crushed his big ego and shattered his self-worth into small pieces; it wasn't me smirking delightedly because I needed that big ego crushed in order to increase my own sense of worthiness in life. And he definitely wasn't the one who was pathetic. I was. For the first time that evening, when silence fell it didn't bring peace with it. It brought a monumental stone of disappointment. And disgust. These two unexpected guests robbed me of my idiotic crown as man of the day and left me wondering just one tiny question: what he hell was I doing. \"You know he has no right to speak to you like that, man.\" At first he didn't moved. Which certainly didn't make my job of soothing the atmosphere any easier, but I restrain myself from underlining it. Then I saw that he was actually nodding, rather imperceptibly, until his temples brusquely jumped out from his hands: \"Funny, I don't remember your name on the door of my weekly psychotherapist office.\" \"'Cause I don't need to be a fucking shrink to figure out you must have some hell of family dinners with that thing under your roof.\" He might not have had the courage to look me in the eyes, but the way his shoulders had shrivelled up was evident clue of how much I was crossing the line. And he was nodding again, this time quite vigorously: \"You know nothing ,\" he stated, plain and simple, though tensely chewing a bit of his lower lip like they weren't pleasant words to give birth to. \"About my dad, Stuart. Absolutely. Nothing.\" He managed to make my name – the right one, eventually- sound like some kind of horrendous insult. Which brought a snort to my nose. \"And let me say: God blesses ignorance.\" Attempt of humour? Tragically failed. Past midnight in the meeting area of the Google base, and his face was still the darkest place of the room. I tried to match the image of the Graham I knew – his posh look and you're-a-teeny-tiny-insect-I'm-gonna-wipe-off-the- face-of-the-hearth attitude- with this guy, this depressing kid whose most scary feature was how longer he could stare at the floor without falling asleep. For a brief moment I convinced myself I had been dreaming it all: father, son, the amiable chitchat. Otherwise it would have been hard holding back the need to dig deeper. After all, I may not be fond of any empathic connection with people's drama, but I'm definitely a overly curious detailed-oriented geek who was currently feeling like he had found himself in front of an exceptionally complex code debugging he just could not bring himself to solve. \"Sure you don't wanna cry? Come on, this has already become one of those cheesy scenes you see only in MTV shows. In for a penny, in for a pound.\" \"You shouldn't even been here from the start.\" Graham growled all of a sudden, ignoring me. \"Yeah.\" I sighed in response. \"Tell me about it.\" And there was nothing either he and I could add to that, because it was bloody true: I should've not been there. A seriously weird, fucked up trick of destiny had put his bad temper with my bad temper and then waited for us to knock each other out. Or to bond, who knows. At that moment I was really about lo leave. The Angry Birds championship was practically screaming out for me from the left pocket of my jeans: \"You want me to call someone? Friend, girlfriend, teammates. The Childline.\" \"What did I say about the charity case thing.\" \"Right. Sorry. Must be the googliness talking. \" He chortled. Mmh, second attempt of humour? Not so bad after all. \"Oh please, there's no such thing as 'googliness'.\" \"Well that's interesting.\" \"What.\" I smacked my lips, sincerely surprised: \"We actually do agree on something.\" He slowly, tiredly, suspiciously lifted his eyes to meet mine. I can't describe how uncomfortable it made me feel to jump once again into the depths of his intricate universe. Had he always been so crystal or I was getting surprisingly – and annoyingly- good at reading him? \"Listen.\" he said with a condescending smile that looked a lot less condescending due to the list of words that got stuck between eyes and throat. A list I could magically see. \"Why don't you go slumber partying with your team and leave me alone for just one goddamn second, okay? We forget all about this crazy… midnight… encounter , and tomorrow we start a bright new day rivalling as we are always been meant to. How does that sound.\" \"It sounds like you really need to stop acting like your father,\" I burst with half an exasperated laugh. \"And maybe start getting you ass out of all this depressing fucked up shit that has nothing but…\" Okay that was probably not my best line. Here it went my lack of diplomacy again. To my defence, I was desperately fighting against his huge radioactive aura which was piece by piece dragging me down into an atrocious abyss of resentment and anxiety and oh God, is this what you people call 'empathy'? That's just nasty. Maybe I was lucky to be hit by his fist even before I'd finished my stupid life lesson. Maybe it stopped the contagion. Well, whatever. One thing was sure. That final punch? It put a definite end to the ridiculous yet sacrosanct Googliness, even to its smallest traces that had managed to pop out during that night. Although I couldn't come out with the reason why that didn't thrilled me like it should have.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 3 Wrong REM stage (1.0) A/N Thanks so much for the kind reviews, I jumped up and down my room for at least 15 minutesXD Please be patient with me, I'm an incredibly slow writer, and once again I apologize for all the grammar mistakes: I'll try to get back to them as soon as I …well, learn English :P Last thing: I support realism. In case nobody told you, I have a total of four bigger brothers. Four. And that was all my mind could think of while my team and I were epically (let's say ridiculously) running (uhm limping?) under a cheering (mocking) choir of applauding witches and wizards (creepy dudes and chicks all dressed up like different versions of Ralph in the movie 'Up') through the entrance of the Quidditch pitch. Broom in one hand, cell phone in the other and just one little bastard sunray poking at my left eye and making impossible not to look as much stupid as I was already feeling inside. That was it. I officially hated that bloody internship. It was draining just to get to the centre of the playfield. Unlike Billy and Nick, who were quite impressively hyped up making them seem even more psychotic than usual, my physical batteries were dead. Dead. My mind was more than disconnected, it was flat, deflated, unbelievably crumbled in many tiny pieces of concentration that were floating all around me with zero intention to get back into human form. Nothing could persuade my neuronal system to slip out of that REM stage. Nothing. The explanation for the sudden reluctance of my eyelid to stay open was pretty simple: I hadn't had a good night sleep for ten days straight. My dorm had been drowned in two feet of cold water by some drunk weirdo who happened to have a real fetish for Titanic. My roommates, other twenty fellow partners in misfortune and I woke up in the middle of the night asking ourselves if we should call the police before or after searching for life jackets. We all got temporarily spread into different buildings, waiting for the final arrangement. Luckily enough, I was assigned to a single room. Ergo, for precisely nine nights I had been 'sleeping' – notice the inverted commas – completely and painfully alone. What's the big deil, you ask? The big deil is that, in case nobody told you, I have a total of four bigger brothers. F.O.U.R. I've never, ever, ever been an entire night all alone in a room without some bossy pest aiming at noiselessly murder me with a pillow. This is essentially the reason why I got a master degree in self-isolation: at home, building a fortress is a matter of survival. Personal space is cut down to the bone, the words 'alone time' make everyone giggle, privacy is pure blasphemy. Kick me non-stop under the sheets, and I'll sleep like a log; leave me in a room empty enough to perceive the whisper of the wind echoing inside the plumbing, and I won't close one eye from ten p.m. to ten a.m. Pathetic, uh? So you guys may understand why after something like eighty hours of sleep deprivation I could not burst on the scene as the perfect archetype of sport enthusiasm. My head felt heavy, my muscle hurt. I could barely walk. \"Alright teams, welcome to the Quidditch pitch!\" The 'fun' – other inverted commas here please – thing about life is that it generally chooses the moment you're most out of breath to make you run. I noticed this not only when Neha gently nudged me in the ribs to make sure I was still alive, or when Lyle asked me whether I was muttering or snoring, no, it was pretty clear the moment I realized I was only three meters away from someone I had pushed back in some recondite meander of my mind for almost two weeks now. That night. That night had been removed, minute by minute, word by word, until there were hardly any traces of it left in my memories. The fact that I hadn't shared my bizarre adventure with the rest of the team was a clear demonstration of that. First, we weren't a team. We barely passed as a casual reunion of after-the-cure cases. Second, I had a deep and rather inexplicable need not to talk, think or even envision that night. No comment. And…Well, there was a third reason, but you don't really expect me to keep all three points in mind while I'm in this state, do you? I had clearly no idea of what had happened later with his father. Nor had I paid particular attention to him during class time. As a matter of fact, that, right there, was in all probability the first time after fourteen days that my face found itself virtually in the same line as Graham Hawtrey. Too sleepy to laugh at how much he reminded me of a cross between a tennis trainer and a Smurf, but not sleepy enough to ignore that fiery spark in his eyes. Was it just a figment of my imagination… or Graham appeared to be even more aggressive than usual? The guy had always been on the sociopathic side, but the way he led his team towards the centre of the pitch was the one of a catholic avenger. The whistle caused me a heart attack. \"Let's have a good clean match, nooglers!\" Squatting over the white line in the outer margin of the field, I heard Graham's scratching voice shouting from the other side: \"No mercy! NO MERCY!\" before the match began. The first half turned out to be an absolute disaster . Our couple of gramps was at a complete loss, Yo-Yo was possibly the slowest runner in San Francisco, Neha invested all her energy into yelling orders, Lyle vanished after ten minutes of indolent jogging around the field and I received a disrespectful - and totally uncalled for- ball to the head when caught up looking at my phone. Apparently, 'I wasn't giving a shit'. How ungrateful of my several efforts not to collapse on the grass. As the first timeout was called, I wasn't the only deadbeat player on the team anymore. We gathered around a murky sense of discouragement, under the pressure of an irreparable score. Seventy to zero. It was over. \"It's over.\" Stated Neha in a sigh. \"Yes, this team's a joke.\" I emphasized. \"Listen, we need to get our minds right and start believing...\" It only took a Flash Dance reference and a maniac-group-calling to clumsily inspire our reluctant team spirit. At least that's what happened with everyone else. In a matter of seconds, I saw the faces of my teammates light up one after the other, whereas my scepticism persisted. Call me unromantic, but I'm not exceptionally touched by idea of being compared to a wilder girl who spins into people hearths. But don't you worry. My good dose of inspiration found me a couple of minutes later. Unlike theirs, it wasn't much of a cinephile lecture. No words. No movie references. No affectionate or pseudo-paternalistic smiles. Nothing community-wise, it was all very private, I'd even say exclusive if this word didn't mean I drew any pleasure from it. A type of exclusivity that rang a bell. My inspiration came and, more importantly, faded away all in form of one glance. Graham's glance. Why don't you quit already , his eyes were silently teasing me from the opposite side of the pitch. He had got himself already in position. How serious he looked. You wouldn't have a chance if I really started to care, mine answered as I was dragging my ridiculous broom towards the starting blocks. But you won't , I could hear him asserting before putting his glasses on. Sean never cares. The second time I dropped my knees on the white light I was astoundingly awake. \"It's Stuart, asshole.\" I surprised myself mattering. \"Hey buddy, snoring again?\" \"Not this time, Lyle.\" Not this time. Now, if you expect me to give that brief eye-to-eye collision all the merit of getting my head in the game, you're simply delusional. Though I would be the delusional one if I didn't admit that it served me well. We rocked the second half of the match. The second half of the match baptised our team. We got our seventy points back with no intention to stop there, amazing each other with how good we were able to hit it off. Especially Neha and I. Who would have thought it. So I really couldn't devote any special attention to the responsible of my sudden interest in the game, since I was way too busy zipping through the field, parrying balls with a broom stroke and honouring the Harry Potter universe with the only actual magic of the day: the reflection of my phone. Graham was once again gone, sucked into the back of my mind one more time. I ignored him and he –presumably- ignored me. Or so I thought until my mind started showing some real paranormal activity, indistinguishable at the beginning, then more and more evident. The Quidditch pitch was a chaotic tangle of non-flying flyers, nevertheless even in that pandemonium I could notice I had started to feel like the unwilling pole of an invisible magnet. Regardless of how little I cared –in fact I didn't, at all - I knew where he was standing, I knew when he was moving, I knew where and when and what he was barking at each of his damned teammates. Even the smallest of his steps got somehow recorded. It could have easily been my five senses sharpening as the match got harsher and harsher, of course, but how come it applied to one person only? And precisely the person I had kindly forbade from visiting my mind again? That freaked me out a bit. Alright, a lot. And I'll tell you why: I don't give people unnecessary space, either in my mind or in my life. I wondered if the other pole of the magnet felt that too. In any case, I did what I do best: I shut him out and I used that unexpected super power at my advantage. The problem is that even that advantage wasn't enough. As soon as they detected our renewed team spirit, our enemies opened the gates to an updated level of brutality. And when Graham's fingers wrapped around the golden snitch, we knew the die had already been cast. The defeat smashed us. The light in our eyes burned out, along with all my last burst of energy. Crushed, exhausted, back in the REM stage and convinced that nothing could have ever comforted me after the disturbing image of Graham lifted above his team heads, I felt my pocket buzzing. Mindlessly, I sneaked a quick look at the message that had popped up on the screen. I was already on my way to the locker rooms, when I stopped. \"Hey buddy,\" It was Billy's sweaty hand on my shoulder. \"Don't let them put you off, man, you did such a great…\" \"I'm gonna…\" \"No, no, see, you have to…\" \"Sleep.\" I paused. I smiled. I stared intensely at the phone screen. And I repeated: \"I'm going to sleep.\" In that moment it would have been legitimate to call me a maniac. Billy's sweaty and questioning look called me a maniac. I called myself a maniac. But who cared. My sleep deprivation days were over. I had a new room.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER 4 Five out of five (1.1) A/N Ages later she finally published. And a lousy chapter too. Listen guys: what about I pay you to read, sounds fair? :D Important note: Graham's team, if you have never cared to count, has got 5 people + 1 (him) Some prestigious, football-obsessed smarty pants once said: 'individual commitment to a group effort: that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work'. Today, I am proof that Vince Lombardi was indeed completely right. You ask why? Because my personal asshole's team had individually committed to the group effort of pissing me off. \"Am I invited too or am I too sexy for the audience.\" I brusquely stepped in. \"See, I wouldn't want to scare the competition.\" It was less then twenty minutes after the Quiddich game and I can honestly say that the only thing worth noticeable in that unexpected picture was me and my inability to figure out why Neha had been standing all that time outside a male locker room I was the only one left in. I'm not even going to apologize for how much of a dummy I turn into when it comes to women psychology. It had taken me half a second to recognize the tall, pale, German-looking guy spread against the wall ridiculously close to Neha, with a bottle of beer in one hand and at least other three or four inside his veins. No clue of his name, though. Well, not that I moved mountains to solve the big mystery. When I interrupted his pathetic flirting session, Neha had mere disgust painted on her face. \"I don't get it.\" he bubbled in state of confusion. How could he already be drunk, seriously, the game was like five seconds before, was he trying to beat a record or something? \"Right, you must be the brain of the team.\" I sighed. Still tired, still sleepy. Still outrageously intolerant to anything and anyone that even slightly reminded me of Graham Hawtrey's existence. \"Does you boss use you as a pouching ball or he just picked you because you were the only one who could reach the jar of cookies on the shelf.\" The state of confusion deepened in front of my eyes. My impatience emerged in form of compassion: \"Listen, I don't have a spelling-book close at hand, but I'll try to make it clear anyway: back. Off. Let the lady breathe .\" \"The lady can do whatever she wants, I'm just inviting her to a party.\" \"Before or after trying to jump into her panties? \"Hey, pal…\" \"Don't 'hey-pal' me, don't even try.\" \"Can someone tell me who the hell is this guy?\" \"Haven't you got it already? \"What?\" I sighed again, deliberately too melodramatically: \"I'm the boyfriend , you cookie-reacher idiot.\" If my eyes were alive enough to move without making me feel dizzy I would have probably noticed the sudden change of light on Neha's face. Instead I noticed the blonde's change, or better non-change, before the harsh arrival of a tall brunette ruined my plan to increase his confusion until he wasn't sure what kind of exotic ectoplasm he was. \"Team meeting.\" she hissed after less than a quick, condescending look at Neha and me. \"You got two minutes.\" \"Now?\" \"He just messaged me: if we don't get there now he's going to do it on his own.\" \"Shit.\" \"My God are you drunk ?\" While the punching ball was busy convincing his teammate that the surprising inarticulacy of his brain was just due to the thrill of the victory on field, Neha softly waved at me and stepped closer. \"Hey.\" \"You're okay?\" \"Yeah, but I think we gotta go too.\" I laughed. She didn't. I stopped, and instantly knew there was no answer she could give me that made me restrain myself from bolting towards the Google reception and demanding my lovely brand new accommodation. But I asked anyway: \"Gotta go… where?\" She was curling up a finger into her hair. She seemed weird. Somewhat sickly. Looking back, she was probably just uncomfortably blushing but, as I said: male flirtation was an open book, female…ehm. \"Bill and Nick sent me a picture, possibly a motivational one. I spent ten minutes just to remove it from the spam box but, whatever, there was a message with that: they said we could discuss a bit the app idea. If we feel like it. Just to…uh, 'ride the wave of our renewed team spirit'.\" Notice the consistent difference of orders. On one hand, there was the military asset of a S.W.A.T team: two minutes, no complains, either you're in or out, fuck you. On the other hand…us: vague unconvincing requests seasoned with affectionate encouragement and ineffective sense of motherly guilt. For a second I couldn't decide which team I felt more pity for. \"Oh and…\" Sickly face's back. \"Thanks, Stuart.\" \"Wait!\" We were already some metres away from the S.W.A.T team, when we heard the guy blurt out, forcing us to accelerate the escape. \"Wait, you're not Stuart Twombly, are…?\" \"Nope.\" I bluntly lied, ignoring each and every of the following attempts to catch my attention. Last thing I wanted was to wait long enough for their boss to come and pick his babies up. \"Well, fine!\" I heard him shouting at one point. The point I believed I had finally managed to knock him off. For Pete' sake, what did he want now? \"…just thought you wanted to know I'm your new roommate…\" Three out of five. The signs were against me. \"Alright, my friend, we have just one other double room available…\" \"You're not my friend.\" I corrected him immediately. \"If you were my friend you wouldn't have put me in a room with that nazi drunkard of your friend.\" \"He's not that bad, you know.\" \"I clearly don't.\" \"Ah I'm Zach, by the way.\" \" Lovely .\" I exulted in a pant of exasperation. \"Can I have my keys now, Zach?\" I was clinging to the reception desk like I wanted to climb upon it. Or smash it. Or kick it and start howling like Tarzan, what different does it make. My jaw couldn't tighten any more without my teeth popping out, yet, with all the bucolic nonchalance that institutionalized services teach to all their employers in order to make the easiest of processes have the more torturing resolution, the chubby smiley guy in striped shirt and bermuda on the other side of the desk couldn't get the hint and kept on vomiting the story of his unoriginal life: \"…then I had to take this job, you know, because my parents work a lot but don't have that much money, so my sister went to collage, in New York you know, and I found this thing here and I didn't know, you know…\" Oh God. That gay had the attention spam of a squirrel. \"Zach? Zach? My keys.\" \"Right, right.\" More typing and more attentive scanning the computer screen. \"Uhm yeah if you wait here a couple of minutes I'll check the name of…\" \"It's half past eleven in the night, Zach.\" For once, the melodrama in my voice was as genuine as my puffed-up eye sockets. \"You've wasted ten days and fifteen hours just to get me the room wrong: I'm afraid if I give you two more minutes I will need to ask you to hire me.\" \"Well we're actually a little short of…\" \"Jesus I was kidding !\" \"But you're sure…?\" \"Yeah.\" I icily confirmed. \"Don't care.\" \"But I must warn you that in the possibility…\" \"Reeeally don't care.\" \"…there are no other rooms available near the…\" \"Okay let's try a brief exercise of lips reading: I. Don't. Fucking. Care.\" And I really didn't. Whoever was my new roommate, it certainly couldn't be worse than that hormonal alcoholic moron. No doubts about it. \"I haven't been sleeping for more than a week, Zach, I'm basically a walking corpse with glasses, now can I have my keys or do I have to prepare a twenty-six slides power point presentation for the concept to dig in.\" As it usually did, my complete lack of empathy with bureaucratic bullshit made some eyebrow fly higher but eventually accomplished the goal. In a matter of precious seconds my hands were finally holding the solution to my insomnia. I was ecstatic. Dangerously over the moon. I even managed to feel unaffected by the glimpse of another familiar brunette rushing towards his teammate on the other side of the desk, with tears poorly masked in her kajal (whoa how do I know the term \"kajal\"? I'm beginning to scare myself). Four out of five, then. Yuhoo. Next time a want a score table just for keeping track of how much time Hawtrey's team spends haunting this place. But, as I said: nothing could bring me down of my enthusiasm. Almost nothing. \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" I said, jumping back. There were two option my mind could think of: fate. Or stalking. \"Again.\" \"Right.\" I cleared my throat, trying to codify the reason of the little tiny smile carved on the corner of Neha's eyes. Voilà, enthusiasm gone. \"Listen, I really need to…\" \"Yes, I know.\" she said. Giggling. With no apparent reason. \"I heard you had a midnight encounter with a titanic re-enactment.\" I nodded with a plastic smile: \"Troubles love me.\" \"I was just…You know, passing by, do you need me to…?\" She unexpectedly paused to take a deep, anxious breath. \"Listen, can I tell you something?\" \"Can you talk and walk?\" She laughed, after finally- and I can't highlight this adverb enough- finally noticing the two gigantic bags laying at my feet. She decided to accompany me to my new room, insisting she gave me a hand that I was too exhausted to chivalrously refuse. \"I guess we started a bit harsh, didn't we?\" affirmed Neha at one point, while we were walking through the infinite labyrinth of hallways of the interns dorm. Outside of the windows there stood an opaque night and a drowsy moon. I swear, her voice was serving better than a sedative. \"You know, I really appreciated your rescue today. Very heroic. If I knew you were such a gentleman I wouldn't have played this hard on you.\" \"You wouldn't have? Really?\" \"Of course not.\" she smirked. \"I'd have played much harder.\" Looking back at that moment and, above all, at the ravishing look she was furtively giving me, it was bloody evident how it was going to go. Looking back at that moment, I had no formal right to be surprised of what happened just a couple of days later. Uhm. Alright spare me the critics: I certainly wasn't an intern for my social skills. \"Okay, I wanna be honest with you.\" she started. Other deep breath. \"I've never been with a guy.\" \"I've never been with a guy either, do I have to call the press or…?\" \"You know what I mean.\" \"You're gay?\" And that was how much I knew what she meant. \"No! Shit, no. I mean, not that there's anything wrong with it.\" Why are people so politically correct these days. \"It's just that I'm not very good at…you know…relationships stuff. Dates. Confidence. Are you getting what I'm saying, right?\" Couldn't be more wrong. Really: how on hearth could I possibly get was she was saying? \"Uhm…\" I muttered. \"I… guess?\" \"Good.\" Apparently she didn't really caught the question mark at the end of my not-so-much-of-a-statement. \"God, this was so hard.\" Don't tell me: my bags weighted a tonne. Lucky for me, the happy trip around dusty corridors and baffling admissions was over and the lousy look of a brown door cut our elbow-to-elbow walk once for all. \"Well, there you are.\" she exclaimed. \"I actually gotta go too, it was…You know. Nice.\" I yawned. \"Nice.\" I repeated. Very nice. \"Chatting with you without planning a way to strangle you, I mean.\" she clarified, chuckling. \"Don't save any other damsel in distress while I'm gone, okay?\" I did join the laughing, but I was too close to falling asleep to get the reason behind it. \"On my honour.\" I assured. She left me with one of the biggest smiles I'd ever seen on her face. I opened the room door with one the confused look I'd ever had on my face. Finally. It seamed like a dream. The transit to a different dimension. I felt the disconcerted relief of Frodo Bagging returning to the Shire from all of the three interminable movies. Bed. Holy. Lovely. Bed. The room was small. Long, rectangular-sized, with two huge windows above the two immaculate beds symmetrically placed one head against the other. To part them there stoop an insanely neat and organized desk - computer, tablet, the third Alexandrine library worth in books – which had an empty twin desk on the other side of the wall. No posters. No homey touches. No pair of socks distractively rolled up at the end of the bed. Nothing. I was the roommate of a nun. I suddenly heard the squeak of a door on my left, likely the bathroom. I turned, still glued to my spot. The surprise caught me slightly unprepared: \"Finally.\" I mumbled, in a state of bewitched nirvana. \"Five out of five.\" \"Excuse me?\" Nervous throat clearing. \"I think I might be your new roommate.\" I declared. That said, she burst into a big, fat, hypnotizing laugh I stayed there silent just to let myself be lulled by it. It lasted twenty minutes. The twenty-first one I started realizing I had no idea was she laughing about (160 points of IQ and I spend most of my days asking myself what's so damn funny). \"This is gonna be fun.\" she ended up sniggering. \"Apparently.\" I agreed. Still not having a clue of what she was talking about. My eyes had kind of an hard time leaving her. Partly because she had unpredictably popped out of nowhere, and partially because she was one metre away from me, adorably smiling, and roughly wrapped up in a white and rather small towel that didn't cover nor legs or shoulders. The amusement on her porcelain cheeks was framed by the waterfall of blonde, straight hair. She seamed humid. And cosy. That's what I call an interesting turn of events. I cleared my throat for the second embarrassing time and pointed at the bed right in front of me: \"Can I take this one or… Do you have any particular…?\" \"Oh, don't ask me.\" And who the hell should I ask? Unsure whether to laugh again at her unusual and totally incomprehensible sense of humour, I was back scrutinizing the blue of her glittery eyes. This until completely out of the blue- or better out of the shower - once I was already fantasizing about late nights and romantic massage session after long days of pretended work, a face showed up right behind her. And I suddenly, and quite dramatically, regretted to have partaken in the twenty-minute laughing. Because yes, indeed: it was hilarious. Freakishly so. From any other point of view but mine. …and, ladies and gentlemen: there comes the sixth. A/N Necessary chapter. So sorry for all Stuart-Neha fan out there: as you may have guessed, I'm not a huge supporter of their \"spark\". Just to be clear: I haven't given up on this story and I don't plan on doing it, but I'm writing something else so don't EVER hold your breath for a next chapter ;) That side: I LOVE YOU PEOPLE. Honestly.[Chapter 5] CHAPTER 5 (1.0) Darkness speaks louder A/N I'm gonna start blabbering about Google, from this chapter on, so don't trust a word I say. And yes, there is a \"plot\" (big word). Thank you so much for reading, commenting, following, favouring 3 As always: I hate English. So no sleeping for tonight? I fisted the tap of the sink and the stream of water stopped. After drying my hands with the towel and inspecting what looked like the terrifying reflection of a corpse, I collected my phone from the toilet seat and started hammering it with the avidity of my fingertips: Isn't the most ironic thing ever when you get insomnia because of sleep deprivation? , I typed. The three dots in the yellow box triggered the five hundred sixty-third yawn. I had time to complete a full examination of my nasal septum before those three dots eventually gave birth to a virtual sentence: Well nothing compared to the typical unexpected rain on you wedding day. The glutinous and fairly satanic contour of my red corneas giggled behind the glasses: What about a free ride that you have already paid. I really can't stand that good advice that you just didn't take. Isn't it ironic, I typed back. Don't you think? Last glimpse at my decadent appearance in the mirror above the sink and then I rotated, yawned again and switching off the light of the bathroom. And then back to the room. The clock on the wall said quarter past three. In the freaking morning. It was insanely hot and I was crazily alert for that hour of the night, considering that that was supposed to be my first good night of sleep in far too many days. I shuffled my way up to the bed, hoping for a club to fall from the sky and ultimately knock me out. Man, I was desperate. While heading towards my most beloved pallet, a ridiculous thought jumped right into my brain along with the intolerable song by Alanis Morissette: what was I complaining about? I was in fact pretty lucky. Less than two meters from me stood someone who, I bet my woozy ass, would have been much glad to take a club and bash it to my head. That thought made me chuckle a bit- the 'lucky' thing, not the 'bash-in-the-head' thing, that actually scared the hell out of me and made me mentally book a trip to the local gun store. I let myself fall on the bed. Every. Single. Muscle. Of my body. Hurt. Two yawns in a raw: \"Do you ever, uh, sleep?\" I mumbled. \"Do you ever, uh, mind your fucking business?\" he instantly shot back, without ungluing even for one second his eyes from the intimidating pile of papers he had been incessantly scribbling upon for the past four hours. My bare feet climbed on the bed as I laid down, shoulders against the headboard and back sank into the pillow. The sheets were clean and warm. Candidly unaware of the level of hatred I was starting to feel towards them. I looked and looked again in search of the magical key that would have finally taken me to dreamland. Nothing. The phone buzzed. I typed and sweated, sweated and typed. Even in shorts and undershirt I was close to spontaneous combustion. \"Just wanna be sure you're not gonna evaporate when I open the curtain tomorrow morning.\" I said, absent-mindedly. \"Is this a vampires reference?\" he asked. \"Have you lost your sense of humour?\" I replied. \"Have I ever had sense of humour?\" \"Are you asking me?\" \"Do you see somebody else?\" \"Are you rubbing salt into my wounds?\" \"Is this supposed to be an insult?\" \"Was I being too subtle?\" \"Is either of us ever gonna answer a question?\" \"Do you honestly believe I care?\" I tossed a tinge of my satanic corneas in his direction, never pausing the typing as he never stopped the scribbling. From my spot on the bed I had full view of the line of his jaw tightened by the concentration. The right hand was writing, the left was holding an Ipad he happened to slide a finger on from time to time. All that zeal was pretty much creeping me out. Very serial killer-y. So that was it. The cruel game of fate had got me again. Apparently I, Stuart Twombly- fanatical advocate of technological predominance over human interaction and since the dawn of time invested with the holy gift of avoiding any interpersonal frill - would have been, for the rest of that cursed internship, the roommate of nobody other then Graham Hawtrey. The dice was rolled. There was no way back from there. The door had sealed our brand new battlefield. We were alone, imprisoned in the daunting space of twenty cubic metres of tidiness and silence, torn between the danger of finding a bomb under the mattress and the potential thrill of being the one putting it there. I must admit it: when I had affirmed, just a bunch of hours before, that there was no worst eventuality I could imagine rather than the one of sharing a room with the blond dude that was crushing on Neha, I was profoundly and quite naively convinced of that. I could have never foreseen that any merciful god would have had the gut to lock me up in the cage with…well, him. Zach's words from the reception had had started assaulting my brain as soon as the blonde girl with the tiny towel and the hypnotic laugh had left: 'last change', 'no other rooms available'…Great. Come on, he can't be that bad, said the yellow box with a slight buzz. I stared at that box. Stared at my roommate. Only the screen on my phone could appreciate how drenched in sarcasm my face ended up getting. Yawn number five hundred sixty-four. Bury me with my phone and a pair of flip-flops, I typed. What do you need a pair of flip-flops for. How am I supposed to haunt my future murdered if I'm barefoot? The desk rang. Graham grabbed his phone with little to none change in the speed of his mechanical work. He was fairly comical, sat there at his desk, all dressed up in the usual fashionable daytime uniform. If I hadn't had witnessed his skin surfacing from behind Blondie's shoulders before, I had no valid reason not to believe his epidermis was made of cotton. \"Hawtrey's speaking.\" he said, atonal. The moonlight was filtering smoothly and peacefully through the curtains embroideries. I closed my eyes, hands enlaced above the chest. I kept my glasses on: I had no hope for my limbic system to do its job, no matter how many times I could embark on the exasperating journey of counting pixels inside my head. I took a deep breath. More of a desolated sigh. The room smelled of disinfectant and summers wasted on computer manuals. This dorm felt to be much quieter than the past one, if you let me appreciate the only piece of good news of the day. Could it be the position? My neurons started envisioning the Google campus in the semi-darkness of my eyelids. Four dorms, interns only. One for every end of the wind rose: north, south, east, west. I wondered if the architect was an old sea dog or just at a loss for original shapes. \"…yes, of course. Is that all? Not a choice I would call 'intentional'. Exaclty. Perfect, now: what kind of app, you said?...\" I unlocked one eye. \"…uh-uh. So it's free. Great, I'm gonna call them now. Alright. Brilliant. See you tomorrow.\" It was funny to see how much effort that guy actually put into the things that he did. It was slightly less funny to think about what was actually going on. The phone didn't have the time to flip from one shoulder to the other. \"Meeting, now, usual place.\" He was simultaneously writing, speaking, checking the computer screen and flying over the Ipad with the index. I was not impressed. Not at all. \"I don't give a shit: call Zach and the others and tell them we have the topic. Yes, you heard me.\" I was back with both eyes shut. Only God knew how much self-controlled it required resisting the impulse to go there and scatter all of his papers over the desk. \"…yeah make it five or you're out. See? Now you're talking.\" It hadn't passed enough time. Not enough for me to burden myself of the excruciating responsibility of calling the door 'ours', so when a solid knock was threw up by the silence, I barely unclenched my eyes. Instead I remained mummified on the bed. Mummified but vigil. A clot of suspicion had packed a pile of wrinkles on the line of Graham's eyebrows, as he dropped the phone on the desk and shoot me a glance. \"Were you expecting someone?\" he asked, with his typical disdainful tone. It wasn't a question, it was practically an insult. Yeah , my body-language answered. Because I'm such a sociable individual I even stuff my schedule with early gathering at three in the morning just to satisfy my gigantic thirst for human interaction. Graham left papers and Ipad on the desk and sat up from the chair. He was impatient. There was clearly something more important he had to do than finding out who else on campus was awake aside from us. Or, from his point of view, who was brave enough to piss Graham Hawtrey off in the heart of the night. I followed him approaching the door from the narrow crack between my eyelashes. While I started calculating the probability of effectively stabbing him in the back with one of his pens, some weird hemisphere of my brain seamed to be much more interested in recording how serious his expression looked, almost dramatic, plastically severe. A bit of a surprise, comparing it to the strong shades of condescending amusement his cheeks were used to venting in daylight. The show was over, I supposed. Curtains down. Theatre closed. No more need to pretend an enjoyment it only served for political purposes, right? For a second I felt a slight wave of egotism: behind the scenes of my cool-guy performance, I like to think I'm a much more fun son of a bitch. \"Do you need me to illustrate you the complex mechanism of opening a door?\" I offered. Other three seconds of keeping that hand on the handle without pushing it down, and I would have had automatically considered it the starting signal for my pen-stabbing operation. \"Who is it?\" \"I don't think thieves are used to knocking.\" I made him notice in a snotty whisper. He tried to ignore me. I clearly saw him try. I spied him bouncing between door and sense of pride, between waste of breath and waste of munitions. Maybe it was the insomnia speaking, but there was a moderate amount of satisfaction I gained from provoking him. Nobody seamed to catch up to my wittiness as fast as him and nobody would ever been more suitable to endure it than a guy who was willing to sacrifice an entire night of sleep just to study. \"Do me this favour, Sean, will you.\" he asked from the door, granting me barely less than quick look. \"Alright, just keep in mind I'm open to suggestions.\" I said. \"I mean, I'd personally go for that fountain pen, but I'm sure any pen will do.\" \"…for the sake of our mutual cohabitation.\" \"And stay still, don't forget it: I wouldn't want to explain the janitor why there's blood all over the floor.\" \"Just shut the fuck up for the rest of your life.\" I giggled. I couldn't help it. \"Do me this favour, Graham, will you.\" I demanded, while the fingertips were back frisking over the phone keyboard and the yellow box played as a distant participant in that game of duelling sarcasm. Tell me something, stranger. If you tell me why you call 'stranger' someone you've been chatting with for more than two years , I typed back. How come you two love birds always end up having adorable chitchats in the middle of the night. \"Alright, just keep in mind I'm not open to suggestions.\" was replying Graham with an annoyed sigh. Maybe because when in darkness it's harder to take clear aim. \"Just hang yourself with a towel and spare me the janitor talk.\" I suggested. In that precise moment the door decided to have a fourth say on the matter. It stepped-in quite noisily, as a matter of fact, overwhelming our peaceful swordfight with a laud and aggressive wave of screams: \"Police inspection! Everybody out of their rooms immediately!\" \"What the…?\" \"Repeat: everybody out or we'll have to enter and dragged you out by force!\" I insisted on keeping my mummified arrangement on the bed, but I have to thank one thing only, for that kind of courage. The shouts had puzzled me, yes, but not nearly as much as Graham's reaction. He had rolled his eyes. \"We are going to count to five!\" continued the voice outside the door. \"If at five you haven't done what we say, we will not respond for any…\" \"Yeah I'd like to see you try.\" Graham was returning to his desk. \"We're gonna start counting, now, people, and it is of vital importance that you…\" \"…cover your balls because I'm gonna get out in two seconds and kick them until you can't walk.\" he barked back. \"…come out nice and smoothly...\" \"Nice and smoothly?\" \"We start with five, four…\" \"Didn't know you could count backwards.\" \"…three, two…\" \"Fuck off, Jason.\" roared Graham at the end, sticking his ear to the phone while polishing off the desk just to methodically stuff half the pens inside the desk drawers and everything else into a small, black, very professional computer bag. \"I don't have time for this bullshit… Yes, it's me, two minutes late. Don't start preaching: it's obviously not my fault.\" Obviously. \"Is everybody there? I've emailed you the description of the app, don't wait for me and start brainstorming… Ah, Sean? Sean.\" He caught me right in the middle of a yawn. \"Just so you know,\" he was saying while switching off computer and Ipad. \"Some kid came over around midnight and left his number on a sticker on the other side of the door. He claimed this is the room he was assigned to. Apparently, your change of mind have messed up with other arrangements.\" \"Wait a second, are you telling me I have a chance not to stay with you? He snorted: \"Well don't look so sad.\" \"I wouldn't,\" I replied, finally sitting up with a genuine spark of hope behind the glasses. \"If only I understood why it was so hard for you to get his number and spare me the time looking for a sticker that must have flied who knows where in this bloody dorm.\" \"I'm not your mailman, Sean.\" \"Right, well, that's a surprise.\" I hissed, emerging from my cocoon of sweat and sliding on two feet. \"Seen you're basically dressed like one.\" \"Come on, Graham, you know the rules.\" started whining the powerful and unexpectedly joyful voice from the hallway. \"New roommate means initiation time! A little bit of Southern hospitality never hurt anybody…\" \"We're a friendly dorm.\" explained Graham to my disgusted expression. \"Yeah, I deduced you were the welcoming committee.\" How the hell did I missed it?, I began to wonder, dragging myself to the door. The only time I had brushed the eventuality of falling asleep was at the beginning of the night and that sweet moment lasted something less than fifteen minutes. Damn. Why do the best things always happens when some part of your being is lost somewhere else. \"Seriously.\" I asked Graham, once I spread my shoulder against the door and started envisioning the absolute exquisiteness of things coming back exactly as they were before moving into that room. An event that dated back ages before. At least in my mind. \"What the hell does this maniac want.\" \"Set you a surprise party and cover you in warm hugs.\" I burst in a fat genuine laugh. Then I realized he wasn't kidding, and the laugh lost half a galleon pounds. \"At three o'clock in the morning.\" My face had gone white. People, people everywhere … \"Does this dorm have the power to transform people in howls or you just all have fucked up circadian cycles.\" \"Well, if it was like this you'd be half our way.\" he affirmed while zipping up his bag with a rapid movement of wrist and then sizing me up with the same rapid movement of eyes. He was back at looking serial killer-y. \"Insomnia, right?\" he diagnosed. \"Scared of sleeping alone, I presume. Tell me if you need me to tuck you with your teddy bear, before I leave.\" How come every single time our glances got somehow enchained I could literally feel the fire alarm preparing to set off. Those were not sparkles: it was a legitimate danger of a tornado of flames tearing down the whole building. I could never be more eager to change room, after that glance: \"I'm not gonna stay here, asshole!\" I yelled to the mystical presence on the other side of the door. \"Now, if you find a sticker somewhere around, just slide it under the…\" \"You're not gonna do it.\" I heard Graham stating. \"Aw, I'll miss you too.\" I carelessly, spitefully, sarcastically replied. Then back shouting at the mystical presence. \"Hey man, you still alive? Have you found it or not?\" \"Let me rephrase it.\" he stepped-in again. \"You're not gonna manage to do it.\" \"Always loved the good old optimistic spirit.\" \"How much do you know about The Helix, Sean?\" \"For what I sincerely hope it's the last time.\" I hissed, investing all my energies into a clear, neat spelling. \"The name is Stuart .\" \"Answer the question.\" The presence had decided to retrace its own steps. Apparently his previous flop hadn't discourage him from having full faith in the effectiveness of the 'beware-I'm-the-cops' act: \"We're smashing the door, now, we're not…\" \"I'll come out within two second, Jason.\" growled Graham exasperated. \"Use your brain and don't let me find you there.\" \"The Southern dorm will never turn his back at its new novices!…\" \"Have you heard what I said?\" \"Why don't you answer my question, Graham.\" I suddenly proposed, monitoring him behind the most disinterested facial expression, as I typed the yellow box the good news. I was leaving that bastard. Oh yes I was. \"Like how are you going to convince me not to tell Chetty you have moles who give you the subject of the challenges two days ahead of time.\" \"I didn't realize I was so important to you that you'd rather turn me in instead of appreciating the fortuity of the situation and use this miraculous piece of information to scoop your pathetic team out of the hole your incompetence have thrown you into.\" \"Sorry, I fell asleep on the fourth word.\" I yawned. \"Do you always feel the need to give this kind of sermons or they're part of the welcoming strategy to make me wish I was anywhere else but here?\" Graham gradually stepped closer, black immaculate computer-bag on his shoulder, impenetrable mask of professionalism from forehead to chin, while carefully inspecting his spotless desk to check if he wasn't leaving anything essential behind – I guessed he feared I could steal one of his Moleskine and sail to Mexico to open up a market with his notes. I struggled not to jump back, when I raised the eyes from the phone and found him there, three spans from my face, same position spread against the door. Synopsis: two people trapped inside a room by an overly-hospitable maniac. Someone please make a movie out of this. \"It's called cheating, you know.\" I helped him noticing, adjusting my glasses on the nose. \"It's called winning, but hey: don't feel compelled to know the term.\" \"Still digging the whole ' com-pe-ti-tion' bullshit, uh.\" My grin served well. He wasn't expecting a direct reference to our little midnight encounter as much as I couldn't wait to see the shame on his face once I remind him I still saved his condescending butt. Blackmailing looked such a fun perspective, in that instant. Graham tilted his head on one side and slowly slid his hands into his pockets. The only two words I know that can describe the spiky intensity of his expression are 'mafia stare'. And we were slightly too close for me not to feel a tinge of uneasiness picking at my intestines because of that stare. God, how much I couldn't wait to get that number, call the guy and leave that fucking room forever. \"You were one of the twenty people who were evacuated due to an hydraulic accident, am I right?\" \"Well look who's important for whom, now.\" \"The funny thing that you probably don't know, Sean.\" he affirmed, sharpening his stare until the pupil was half a pin. \"Is that it wasn't an accident at all.\" It took me a while to scrutinize the metallic confidence of his face. And even after that while, I still could not decide weather he was bluntly shitting me or that dorm was indeed the dépendance of a psychiatric hospital. I sneered. Unconvincingly so. \"What the hell are you talking about.\" The door was still pounding with words, but at that point paying attention was not an option. And even when the yellow box trilled, I was stack into the mafia stare. \"How much do you know about The Helix?\" asked Graham for the second time in that night. And this time he showed half as interest as for the first one, which is actually pretty amazing, seeing that for the first one he had practically spit that name right against my bending eyebrow. \"The Helix.\" I repeated. I shrugged. \"I know everything that's needed to know.\" \"So you've never heard of it.\" concluded Graham with a quick peek at his watch and an unexpected sigh that accompanied his detaching from the door and quickly heading towards the exact opposite direction. I followed him with my eyes. But only because that opposite direction was promising of another fat laugh and I had to regain those twenty galleons I had lost from the first one. Furthermore, I liked him being two metres far from me. It seamed to make the room suddenly breathe. A lot more air in the air. Like our proximity was a leech for vital survival ingredients. \"You're not gonna manage to swap room, Sean.\" Graham's voice and body jumped on his own bed and started unlocking the large window overhanging there. \"But in case you do…\" He spread open the window, shoulder bag secured against the hip and a solemn smirk I was starting to recognize a little bit too well. \"Please don't forget to lock the door behind you. And, oh yeah: you can leave the teddy bear on the bed.\" \"Hey.\" I protested. \"How do you get this guy unstitched from here?\" \"Haven't I told you?\" Were his last words before disappearing in a theatrical cloud of moonlight shadows. \"I'm not your butt-saviour either. Have a good night, Sean.\" The next thirty-five minutes of the night are better to be left untold. Let's just say I familiarized with the synthetic wood of the door to the point I started rehearsing telesales of it in my head. And meanwhile the maniac party-planner on the other side of that unique and astonishingly resistant door (insert plastic smile and unnerving voice here) kept on insisting I should reveal him my favourite animal so that he could make it out of a balloon, my mind had fixed itself on something. There is a reason why I spend an obsessive amount of time sailing the treasures of international archives. And the reason is simple: I don't like not knowing things. Meg , I typed in the familiar green box, shoulder still stuck to the wood because the bed had betrayed me long enough and the insomnia was beginning to assume the role of my bestest enemy. Give me everything you know about The Helix. A/N Grammar grammar grammar *repeatedly hits the wall with her head*[Chapter 6] CHAPTER 6 (1.0) Plato was drunk A/N I'm not sure what the hell am I doing, but I hope anybody reading this fic understands that: 1) I hate English 2) I'm the slowest and most unreliable writer on the planet 3) I choose development over rushing things 4) very little of what I'm blabbering about Google is actually true. Cheers ;) Let me tell you a little story. There was a guy, once. A coy, lanky, slightly insecure, funny-looking fella with past experiences of Lego cubes squeezed into his nose and a ponytail proudly paraded all around the middle school backyard for the duration of a hippie phase that began and ended entirely in his mind. It was a guy like many, a guy like you, sharp by choice and intolerant by design, nerdy genes in his DNA and some emo left-overs from too much MTV nurturing. He was the kind of individual destined to collect labels over labels and discard them one by one on the way to full independence, already gaining by a young age a fair level of edginess and a reasonable range of techniques to obviate the inconvenience of having a vocation for feeling way to much. And maybe this was his first problem. Feeling. Everything was always so intense for him, so unbearably real, and close, and personal, gluing him by force to a world that had never really disconfirmed his suspicions, with no sympathy whatsoever to the way he had to crawl out of every broken bond and resurrect from the inflicted disappointment while having very few people to truly confide in. And just because the MMC (Macho Man Code), that was already towering over him by the age of ten, had spoken clear: boys don't need to trust. They are trained to convert their curses to valuable Lancôme-commercials poses and dismember any piece of humanity survived by all the Dragon Ball marathons to something tough, firm, indestructible, something much more appealing to society. And to women. Especially to women. Which brings us to problem number two. Girls. There was always something deeply unforgiving about women, or so he thought. He didn't know much about them - aside from their extraordinary ability in sucking the coolness out of a ponytail - but, after a few honest attempts and a genealogical predisposition to statistics, he figured out that it wasn't actually a matter of 'not forgiving': they didn't fail to absolve guys faults, they just needed the guys to have faults they could implement. Yes, I'm talking about the 'girls love bad boys' well-known fact, and for the girls out there who claim to have valid arguments to confute it, I'd die to see you try. Because the truth is that girls thrives under the pressure of having to craft the empty heart of their men. They just melt in front of a Pinocchio they can pretend to treat as a real boy while secretly waiting for their chance to bidibidodibidoo him (I don't think it was the same cartoon) into the Prince Charming of their choice. In other words, there was something irresistible but also unimaginatively pretentious – or so our guy felt, anyway – in the gentle sex's addiction to men who show so little that there must be space in there for a complete renovation. Basically women approach relationships as trips to IKEA. A negative affect surely originated by the too many hours spent brushing synthetics corpses (aka the Barbies) that had conditioned generations of girls to look at the right guy as the perfect accessory. Now. I know what you're thinking. It was the middle of the freaking night. In just a couple of hours I had to activate my best smiles to convince Chetty that our app was nothing less than the sophisticated outcome of intense brainstorming, rather than the quick piss taken by a horny drunk by the bushes. I was covered in sweat and glitter, neither of them mine. My sense of orientation had been limited to the circumference of a beer bottle, which was a despicable GPS when it came to the Googleplex labyrinth. So, Stuart: did it really seem the best time to write mental psycho-sociological essays about the opposite sex while you're likely to end up in Mexico before getting to your dorm? …Yes. And the reason, if you must know, lay on my skin. More precisely, on the glossy, strawberry-flavoured kisses Neha had printed on my neck during a night that I won't store in memory but for jumbled flashes. I remembered so little, regretted so much. Those horrific flashes kept on hunting me, as I strolled somewhere between the beach volley courts and the swimming pool, trying to regain lucidity through a chat with Siri that was boosting my sense of helplessness. \"… The address requested isn't listed among the available destinations …\" \"Home, lady, I wanna go home , you motherfu…!\" Flashes. The first thing I remembered was sitting on a chair. Leg folded on one knee and the soul-soothing picture of a Canadian lake pumping positive karma from behind my shoulders, I was busy explaining in bitter words to our naïve veterans what is really like to be twenty-one in this miraculous world of catastrophic optimism. To be honest, my bitterness wasn't completely to be blame on the American capitalistic race. It was the combination of the fifth message in two days that gently informed me that the room swap wasn't an option anymore and the sudden showing up of someone's face. A face that circumstances were fighting hard to make me acquainted to, but hell no, I wasn't giving in: 'Hello fellow interns! Graham Hawtrey here, I've taken the liberty to attaching the link to our app, which is already being downloaded two hundred and thirty times…' Another scene that kept on playing over and over in my head was set in a totally foreign environment, miles away from where the evening had begun. It must have been hours later and I was grabbing Neha's hip with a hand while holding in the other half a bottle of vodka. The scene was blue, messy and burning hot. Neha's face was a constellation of bright dots wrestling across her cheeks. She was moving her lips, probably talking, hopefully not to me as I could barely focus on the way the neon lights were boogie-dancing on her extremely-too-clothed cleavage. I guessed at one point the talking was over, because I found her tongue in my mouth and the lights had been turned off, evaporated into darkness. I remembered tasting shyness, alcohol and enthusiasm along with a weird ammonia– flavour that I wasn't sure if it was aiming to resemble strawberry. The lights went back on, although the kiss wasn't over: I had opened my eyes. An uncomfortable feeling at the back of my throat was intensifying as I started to feel dizzy. I was too high to refuse her body, too horny to rebel to the game of grasping and stroking and moaning in the other ear, too right to say that something was wrong because 'wrong' is the wrong word to describe something right that just doesn't fit your mood. And in that situation my mood was definitely right. It had to be. So I pushed her against the wall, seized her most eager and inexperienced moans, the zip of my jeans gathering more tension by the second, my fingers impatiently lowering on her right thigh… \"…a hand? Hello?\" …hand tangled in her hair as my head kept ringing at the speed of the techno music howled by the… \"…hear me? Hey, I said: do you need a hand?\" What? Who is this? \"Com' on, let me help you stand up...\" Wait, what, this wasn't part of the flashback. I was doing a marvellous flashback, who dared interrupt me while I was wait a second someone's touching me who is touching me who dares touch me oh my god what is happening where am I. \"Hey hey chill, buddy, I'm not gonna hurt you.\" Someone's laugher is demolishing my eardrum. Make this someone stop. Now. \"Here, let me help you. Crazy night, uh?\" …great big world, my friend… …just three inches… …I beg you… …boobs, boobs everywhere… Reality had never been my favourite friend. I was already one internet account away from returning my atoms to God and replace them with pixels, but with more alcohol than my blood could take and a headache surgically removing my ability to think straight, it was impossible for me to determine whether the man standing in front of me was real or just a very well programmed avatar. I felt it was rude to ask. I glimpsed at him out of the corner of my eye while I was walking, unsteady and unfocused, thinking of the smell of the grass and Siri's goddamn list of destinations. An arm was fasten around my waist, another along my shoulder. They were the avatar's arms. I studied him to detect his coding style. He looked collected and somewhat soft-spoken, slightly shorter than me, around his thirties, black mass of curls, big quirky eyebrows, a scent of professionalism pouring out of his pores. Basically between a street dancer and a chemistry teacher. \"You're Stuart, aren't you. Twombly? The one looking for a new room?\" \"I can't change it.\" I whined. My voiced reverberated inside my nose. \"It's a curse. Five messages, five , you understand?...\" \"I think I can help you.\" \"It's a curse!\" I yelled at him. \" He made the curse, I know it! I'm a prisoner, it's him! He kidnapped me, I'm gonna call the police, I swear, that's some voodoo shit going on…\" \"Alright, alright, someone's had a little too much fun tonight.\" \"She's a great girl.\" I murmured all of a sudden. Confused and pathetic. \"You know? I know she is. Great girl. Why is it so hard? If people knew I would like 'me? Who?', no no no, but I tried…\" \"I've got a room for you, Stuart, do you hear me?\" \"You're such a cool avatar. So cool. Great resolution, you must be in HD.\" \"Stuart, take a deep breath and listen to me.\" \"Maybe I'm crazy, I know people say I am. You understand? It's just so wrong. It shouldn't be like that, she's a great girl, and I tried…\" There was something on my tongue. It had a slimy consistency, like an eel bathing on my taste buds. I bended over and threw up. Slimy tongue. Slimy, pitted tongue. I felt my tonsils were on fire. I threw up again. \"Okay, let's try with this.\" The man was staring at me with something similar to a smile. A lot of smiles I had received, that night. He even waited for me to rub my mouth and sit back on the bench. Yes, because I was on a bench. Nope, no idea how or when I got there. \"I'm gonna help you get to your room, now, okay? But before I do I'm gonna leave this little card here, right here in your pocket, there's everything you need to know: room number, indications to the dorm, my cellphone.We're gonna keep in touch so I can tell you when the room is ready, alright? But you have to promise me one thing: you're not gonna tell anyone. Can you promise me that, Stuart? That you're not gonna talk with people about this?\" \"You can't take me, you don't know where's my room.\" \"Sure I do, you just told me.\" \"I just threw up.\" \"Then you told me, remember? Let's go now.\" I spent a fair minute reflecting on it. My slimy tongue was drying up. Like my whole body was undergoing some creepy ripening process I had no control over. \"You don't know where it is.\" I insisted. And that suddenly brought to mind another flash of the past night. I realized I knew how it all started: it started with the worst idea at the worst possible time. Billy and Nick - masters of digressions and geniuses at time wasting – had seduced the entire team out of an already teetering working zone to 'hit the reset button'. Before I could even try to remember when was the last time I had shared my free time with the rest of human kind, I found myself sat around a sumptuously decked table in a Chinese-Mandarin restaurant packed with loud drinkers and exotic languages. \"So it doesn't exist?\" I repeated, leaning over the piles of fuming dishes to gain some space for my voice inside that clutter of noises. \"It's just a legend.\" screamed Lyle in return, his forehead already getting sweaty after just two glasses of beer. \"There're people saying that this group bets on the winner of the internship, you know? Like a poker game or something. It decides who're the most promising interns and… roots for them, I guess.\" \"You mean helping them out?\" \"I don't know, I mean, it's just a rumour.\" \"So nobody found anything, no proof, nothing.\" Lyle shrugged, passionately chewing on a dumpling: \"I don't know. I don't even think people researched it, it's not like a serious thing at the Plex. The first time I heard of it, my team manager was making jokes about how there was a 'big brother watching us messing up'. We won three challenges in a raw. It was a scary thought.\" The entire table had exploded into laughers. Again. My tolerance for Bill's disturbing sense of humour was decreasing by the day, but somehow his movie references had passed from indecipherable to logically deducible. Those two's coaxing methods were like the contraindication for haemorrhoid medication: ruthless and utterly unpredictable. I looked around, absent-mindedly, my head ticking: \"So what should 'Helix' stand for?\" \"I always thought it referred to the hat.\" Lyle said, swallowing words and beef without distinction. \"Like, the little helix on the Google hats? I think it comes from there. I don't know, it's just a legend, hey, are you eating those shrimps there or…?\" Then there was the big fight. I specifically remembered getting dragged into a battle of colossal magnitude in which my improvised kefiah and I shone for bravery and sexiness above all the others. Our target was uncertain, our enemies' identity irrelevant. It was enough to see they looked like villains (some people do, extraordinarily so, they've got that 'rapist resting face', you know? Take David Morse for instance) and they were threatening Lyle's God forsaken right to hold ridiculously high standards when it comes to women. After a windmill of punches and some fair Jacky Chan tribute, we celebrated our victory with the bouncer's hands by the scruff of our necks, but not before the villains' leader turned his attention on me. Yes: me. Right before I was knocked into the warm summer night, the blonde guy shot me a glance I was ready to make him digest through his colon and hissed, half-annoyed and half-amused: \"Enjoy the North, loser.\" I was too hyped up not to consider it an insult…Whatever that meant. The adrenaline rush had left us drained. After the battle, we found ourselves locked to a suddenly very quiet night. We stayed there for years, just staring at the Golden Gate, waiting for a dawn that was a lot more personal to us than anything else could have ever been. San Francisco had turned into a magical land. The harsh edges of hysterical business hunger had been smoothed out, quieted down. It was just a piece of world but it seemed gigantic, both unconquerable and undefeated. Like us, in a way. Looking back, that was probably the first moment the word 'team' felt slightly incorrect to describe us. A different term, a more intrepid one perhaps, started to creep in. Family. I saw my comrades-in-arms slowly loosen up under the moonlight. Little by little, worries fading on the background of our bizarre nest filled with birds with broken wings. They were happy. I, on the other end, felt immensely tired. Tired of feeling invincible, tired of the same doubts, tired of pretending to be tired. I stood there with my arms crossed before the intimidating frown of a city I had been dared to overthrow, evaluating the absolute beauty of emptiness. \"Buddy, you were an animal out there tonight.\" I snorted at Nick's clumsy attempt to instil me with some passion. Passion I conveniently didn't show me. \"No, you were.\" he claimed. \"Did you have a good time?\" \"Yes, it was alright.\" \"It was alright…\"he sighed. \"Why do you do that.\" \"What do you mean, do what?\" \"Low ball me like that, come on.\" He always had a little bit of a smile in the corner of his mouth. His cheerfulness was of the shy kind. My kind. \"I'm not gonna take away your cool guy card if you admit you give a shit about something or, God forbid, you had a great time.\" I found myself hesitating. I don't like hesitation. It's vulnerability with a deadline. \"Uh…yeah, it was fun.\" \"Stewe.\" He looked disappointed. They always looked disappointed. I am such a disobedient disciple when it comes to appreciating things. \"What?\" I asked. I knew exactly what. \"Come on…\" \"What, what do you want me to say, it was the best night of my life?\" Because that was what everyone expected from me, right? To renegade my locked up heart and spread it wide open for everybody to see. \"Only if it's true.\" he replied. I was back staring at the dawn. I looked hard and chased the answer I didn't want to make myself ear. When did truth started to have a say on anything, anyway? Wasn't truth just a strategic candy we all give each other (and ourselves) to avoid dealing with the absurdity of what's really true, intensively, infuriatingly authentic? I had just two choices. I chose to lie. \"It was the best night of my life.\" I declared. And maybe it really was. That was the problem. The problem was me, it would always be me. I was a guy, once, who believed that kissing a girl was a life-changing accomplishment. A guy who sought and resisted, a guy we all deep inside are: hopeless. Hopeful. Relentlessly hoping. But that guy was now counting the days spent trying to avoid the guilt of having to prove something and never understanding what, exasperated for not being able to figure out what wall was standing between him and the rest of the world and who built it. And when. Why. That night- the one officially labelled as 'best night of my life' - I came back to my dorm on wobbly ankles and bizarre thoughts spinning inside my head. Love was a big topic. Falling in love. I clearly remember reflecting on those evil letters with intense sense of disappointment while carried on the shoulders of a stranger who'd got all the cards to become my new best friend. No philosophical meditation on Plato's concept of soul mate, no more eloquent mental essays about the biological source of human attraction, no: it was just me. Me and my disappointment. Me and a 'this is how things will always be, uh?'. For a long moment, for a century of peace, I listened to myself mumbling. Sunk in the sweet, indulgent fluffiness of my own pillow, the first morning rays piercing through the blinds and peacefully roaming above me, I simply talked with the ceiling. For the tenth time that night, I had no idea how I got where I was. But I recognized the creases of the sheets beneath me and I could assert with a fair degree of certainty that I was finally back in my room. Quiet, deserted room. \"You know what?\" stated my voice, loud and clear this time. \"Maybe they're right.\" A mild chuckle grew in my throat. \"Maybe they're right.\" I repeated, lauder and clearer, the chuckle swelling and climbing on my lips until I was pretty sure I was laughing my head's off, because my eyes had slimmed down and the ceiling had become invisible. \"Maybe I'm just fucking gay!\" It may have been then, that I gave in to sleep. On the last crumbles of consciousness, I heard the clack of a door opening and closing. I heard steps too. But I was too busy relaxing my muscles one by one and melting inside the pillow. I started having one of those mocking dreams, you know? Those that feel real as hell but catch you still under the sheets making you doubt your entire existence in the first place. I dreamt of standing up from the bed, looking up. And starting to talk. I don't even know about what, I just talked and talked until the skein of feelings inside had untied enough for me to pass on more exciting dreams, like the one of being a plug-in declaring war to Internet Explorer. Or Spiderman. A couple of hours later the alarm shouted in my ears and I had to shove my remains out of bed. The flashes of the night before had overlapped the dreams and the only reliable clues I had were the tangible ones. Like the intense need to bang my head on the wall, for example. Or to pack my sense of smell and hide it forever. Then there was a card in my jeans pocket, but it had lots of letters and numbers so it was hopefully going to solve itself, as soon as the idea of holding a phone to my ear stopped making me shriek like a vampire going sunbathing. What I could not, for the life of me, explained was the little paper file on my desk. And that tiny piece of clue became a huge problem very quickly. Very, very, very quickly. When I opened it. A/N I just pray this chap is understandable.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER 7 (1.0) Sharks do it better A/N I have to actively stop myself from converting Stuart into Stiles and it's becoming a problem. Firstly, I died. I flew up in heaven, had a nice kickboxing match against San Peter, gained the right to restore to material shape (because I won that bastard), resuscitated, lived long enough to remember the reason of my death, passed out, regained consciousness, remembered again and then died one more time. Secondly, I shut the booklet, threw it back onto my desk and started planning for my deportation. I could finally go to Mexico. Improve those five Spanish words I knew (four of them insults and one an anatomically correct term not learnt for medical reasons). I could dye my hair blond, buy rings for all my fingers and change my name into Gonzales (or is Gonzales a surname?). I could even open a food truck selling enchiladas and marry a girl name Constanza. I guess I look good with moustaches. And nobody can say I'm not a great maracas-shaker. While my panic was getting increasingly racist and a quarter of my brain started picturing my old Mexican self lying under a sombrero sipping sangria, I coerced myself into remembering that I had precisely fifteen minutes before my team meeting (yes: we schedule team meetings now, it's all very professional). I dawdled on the edge of the bed, letting the urgency sink in. My body was clambering up the worst hangover from the time my brothers had me convinced that butterbeer was a cocktail made of butternoodles and scotch. My head was spinning, I was sweating in places I desperately needed dry, I smelt like vomit and couldn't help death glaring at my desk every three and a half seconds. For something that was causing such palpitations, it sure looked creepily immaculate. It was just a thin, white, innocent stock of pages. Less than a nail in thickness of printed words. Nothing frightening about that, right? What worried me were two things: one, its content. That alone could have been a legitimate motive behind my suicide. Two: the red, elegant, Egyptian-styled handwriting topping off the cover that I had to decrypt against my headache's will. The writing recited, cold and concise: 'Bibliography on the last page, don't mess it up.' I said, desperate and aloud: \"Someone really need to tell me what the hell happened last night.\" Alright, calm down, I've got enough brain power to remember Bayes formula, I certainly haven't erased important recent events without my conscious consent. That does not happen, not on my watch. I'm usually the only source of lucidity in miles and miles of illogical people. I stood up, teetered a bit, strengthened my spine along a perpendicular axis and then rotated on the spot a couple of times, so as to carefully analyse the crime scene. I was in my room, which was already great news. It was empty, another wonderful piece of information. Nothing particularly stood up: no signs of riot, no bras or Hello Kitty panties tossed on the floor, no bloody axes or chopped-up corpses waving at me from the bathroom and no dogs rescued on impulse from the side of the street drooling all over the carpet. Good. Very good. So the only thing off was… That . I approached the little booklet again, this time more cautiously, in the false hope that the terrifying words I had read before had somehow migrated from the pages. I had realized at that point that the dream I remembered having once I had gotten into bed may have possibly surely definitely been not a dream at all. And as all obsessively reserved people do when confronted with the possibility of having revealed personal information to unwanted guests, I instantly began to bash whomever was listening. But who was it? For a split second I soothed my Mexican panicking self and believed it was Zach. The dynamics of the events weren't important: the essential was not to think logically and avoid reasonable deductions. Unfortunately, no narcissistic pompous pride–sucking serial careerist would have ceded the glory of announcing his new power over his prey. He had signed himself, right on the cover, below the bibliography nonsense. G. Hawtrey. I kept virtually giving mouth-to-mouth respiration to each and every of my neurons while showering and getting dressed. My curiosity was rapidly growing thirsty of details: how did I get to my room? Was Graham in there when I did? What time was it? Did I talk to him? For how long? What did I say? By the time I was at the door, cultivating visions of litres and litres of black coffee sweetening my throat, I was…well, this close to be ready to taken on the asshole. I had thrust the booklet into my bag, squeezed it tight against two others to prevent the unacceptable falling out (nobody was going to know anything about it, that was sure), but I still hadn't read nothing more that the first two lines. Enough to assess the level of vulnerability I was in, not enough to actually work out how exactly Graham meant to use his advantage against me. For the time being, I was at his utter mercy. And I stepped out of the room with one goal in mind: reestablish the godforsaken balance of power. And go to my team meeting and win the internship and get a job, of course, that was important too. I mean: this was the only goal, you understand? This. Not whatever my reluctant roommate was planning to do to ruin my bubble of a life. I'm a focused, distant person. Focused and distant. I shut the door behind me feeling dangerously dizzy. The world is a goofy festival of unpredictable shifting objects when you're not one hundred percent in posses of your physical faculties. Out of the dorm, I dove into a stream of cheering people wondering why couldn't everybody just stop moving that much. I started noticing the downside of working in a place that let colours and shapes scamper wildly: there was too much unnecessary creativity playing around with no supervision and I was back feeling like my two-year-old self having trouble placing the blue cube into the green triangle-shaped hole. The morning light was carving into my eyes like a scalpel, I lacked both balance and patience and my reflexes almost had me killed by making me accidently join some dude's Tai Chi routine. I crossed the campus, threw myself into the main building and finally reached the group of dishevelled heads sat in circle around a small table and a big dose of shame. I'm not gonna lie, I was pleased to see my teammates. I was especially pleased to see them in as much of an indecent state as I was. \"See who's back from the fun train.\" greeted me Bill with a thumb up and a colossal yawn. \"Our sexy man.\" \"Yeah, yeah.\" I let myself fall on the first empty surface available. I landed on a pouf. Nick barely lifted his head from the couch to worry about me: \"We lost you there, buddy, where did you end up after we left?\" \"Hell.\" I said. \"Amen.\" mumbled Lyle, huddled in the corner of the other couch. I clipped my cap on my forehead and ironed myself out enjoying the almost fluid texture supporting my spine. Nobody can appreciate the unnatural design of a pouf more than an hangover survivor. The group was destroyed. Four nerds with more hours of coding in their résumé than minutes in the sun and two grown men on their way to retirement? We were lucky to be alive. \"The whole world looks like a giant pinwheel of death right now.\" I heard myself moaning. \"Price of making memories, Stewie.\" \"I think my liver hurts.\" I couldn't pinpoint where the voices came from or who they really belonged to. But I was okay with that. Aside from that one, I recognized that one: \"Astonishingly, you app…\" I jumped on my comfy pouf just in time to see Chetty materialize behind Nick and welcome us with his familiar unimpressed scold of indifference. \"…received ten thousand more downloads that any other team's.\" Wait, what? \"It appears that you have won your first challenge.\" I heard nothing after those words. Clapping hands and bumping fists bloomed inside our circle of shocked expressions, all searching for each other's eyes as to check that nobody was actually sleepwalking. A wave of pride suddenly got injected into my body to suck the last drops of alcohol out of my blood stream and breath confidence into my lunges. We had a shot. We really did have a shot. Playing a gayer form of Quidditch was not going to be the only disturbing achievement I could vent in front of my brothers for the next ten years of Thanksgivings. Yoyo's stomach aside, we were all ecstatic. \"We're back on, ladies and gents.\" Bill drew us to him in a spiritual moment after shoving Yoyo's face out of the bucket. \"Like Simba on our stone trampoline, we're gonna drop our mouse-eater tattooed uncle off the cliff, get our place back among the cute lionesses and finally go second base with our bestie, alright? Yeah? Hands in, guys, on the count of three. Neha, get in, girl.\" \"Hell yeah, boys!\" \"Lyle, Yoyo?\" \"We're gonna bang her to the Pride Lands!\" \"Stewie? Stuart, buddy. Bonding moment, get in. \" I wanted to. Get in, I mean. But my bonding spirit was momentarily out of order, as my hands tightened around the pouf's love handles, rage filling my nostrils. Just half a second after Bill decided to leave the 80ies movies to his pub pals and blessed us kids with an easier reference, I saw him. He was there, diabolically walking with that evil nonchalance of his, just to vanish out of the room. Graham. \"Yes.\" I finally said. \"Yes, akuna matata.\" \"Akuna matata indeed, bitches!\" The team celebrated its victory with a savage howl and a wheel of raising hands like the true cheerleaders we all deep inside had always been. At that point, yanking ourselves out of the arms of the couch was, if not an easy dream, at least a realizable one. I was the first one realizing it. As the others started picking up their things, still lighting each others up with big fuzzy smiles, I lifted my bag on my shoulders, gave up my smile for a focused and distant front and headed where Graham had just disappeared. \"Where're you going?\" called me out Neha. \"On a mission.\" \"But we got class now.\" I looked into her eyes, feeling the weight of a soldier leaving for war, and replied, focused and distant: \"Asante sana Squash banana.\" I had no idea what I was going to say to him, of course. I marched into his wake fully charged, but at a dangerous loss for words. The booklet was still there in my bag, I could feel it, calling for its master. It didn't took me long to find him. He hadn't tried that hard to conceal himself, for that mattered, and looked seemingly unaware of the danger he was in, standing there at the end of the line, talking on the phone in that miffed tone he used when he wasn't attempting to impress anybody. Usually I avoided the bar, the guy working there reminded too much of Cindy Lou Who and I bore her a decennial grudge for the way she had plagued the Grinch with compassionate feelings. But, as I said, I was on a mission. So I slowly moved in his direction, hoping he could feel his fate looming over him. The bar looked crowded, people still moved too much, so I had to resort to a couple of mean tricks to conquer my place right behind him. I figured my lawyer wouldn't have been interested in the story of how I disarmed a girl in a wheelchair with a pencil, after I told him I had feasted over my roommate body and drunk his pancreas secretions. Once I finally managed to position myself where I could stab him in the back with no chance of missing, the phone call was over. Graham was now busy typing. He had one hand in his pocket, a relaxed pair of shoulders, the most bewildering designer shirt I had ever seen on him and didn't show signs of noticing me. No worries: I would have made myself noticed. I looked around with slight apprehension, sure of meeting the curious eyes of one of my teammates. Nobody on sight. I leaned in and hissed, in the best Batman voice I could master: \"You're a dead man.\" \"I thought we were clear about not causing any more drama.\" he said, serious, without even turning to face me. \"You had three hours yesterday and two this morning: I don't really think there are any more excuses you can bring that are gonna make me change my mind. It's clear you have done absolutely everything in your power to be out of this team, so I'm here to grant your wish: you're out, Zach.\" It took me a while to figure out he had just started talking back into his phone. Damn, you microscopic earphones. Deep breath, Stuart, remember your tax code. You'll need it when you're thrown into a cold cell charged with your first murder. Apparently I had no choice. I grasped those earphones, violently and uncompromisingly pulled them out of his ears, sucking his phone along with them all the way into my hand, so that he was left with no way of overlooking my presence. \"And on the sixth day God created silence and blessed the Man with the inability to shut the fuck up.\" Graham turned just to bumped into my angry Batman face. There was a millisecond of awkwardness I didn't expect from him, just a tiny bit of hesitation on his lips like he had jumped into a sentence and regretted before even seeing it coming out, soon all swept away by the usual overconfidence: \"Brilliant: the children are back.\" \"Sorry to bother, but the time has come for you to justify your existence in this big beautiful universe.\" \"My phone, Sean.\" \"I'm not gonna hurt it, you'll get in back on good behaviour.\" \"Are you threatening me?\" \"If I was threatening you I would have a pool filled with sharks with your phone hanging over it by one of your hair.\" I said. \"I'm barely informing you that I really really really wish I had a pool filled with sharks right now.\" The line was moving on. There were only two people in front of him, now. \"My phone, I said.\" He was visibly resisting the impulse to throw himself at me. In a lethal, non sexual way, of course. \"Now.\" \"Listen. Let's get this clear already: what happened last night was…\" \"Oh god, don't thank me.\" he stopped me. \"It just makes it harder to forget how much time I wasted because of you.\" I couldn't have heard right. I certainly hadn't heard right. \" Thank you .\" I slowly repeated, now more bemused than angry. \"You're welcome.\" \"You are the definition of the criminally insane if you think even for one second that what you wrote in that… thing applied to me in any way and, for the record, even the thought of thanking you makes me crawl out of my skin in disgust.\" \"That is such an interesting thing to say.\" \"And why is that.\" \"Because you're the one who begged me to write it.\" \"I…\" What? \"Of course I didn't. Your bat habits have seriously damaged your brain, 'cause there is no way in hell that I asked you to prove if I was…\" I couldn't finish the sentence. I just chocked on that last word and gulped it down. Which wasn't a great strategy, because what followed was a pause. But not a generic, innocent pause: a meaningful pause. The kind of pause you see on TV shows after a juicy revelation and before the beginning of one cheesy, completely forgettable pop track. Now Graham looked precisely as I didn't want him to look. Proud, aware and not-so-subtlety overjoyed. \"Oh.\" He went, arching his eyebrows and curling up his lips into an effective Joker expression. I tried to look elsewhere but his evilness was hypnotizing. \"Polly can't remember.\" My face went white, my throat dried up and the line move on. We were down at one customer before him. I was still on my mission, still focused, still distant. I had just lost those two grams of confidence I had gleaned from my hangover. \"You're a dead man.\" I hissed again. \"Yes, but even dead men can take their five-o'clock tea in peace, so vanish.\" \"It's eight in the morning and you drink coffee.\" \"I thought you Americans needed stereotypes to relate to the rest of the world.\" \"Don't waste your sense of humour.\" I snarled. \"You can't afford it.\" I was facing his back again. Graham had turned to scan the wide offers of beverages in front of him, pretending he wasn't like all those arrogant douches who enjoy saying 'I'll have the usual please' to sound like they're perfectly at ease in surfing the overwhelming options of our consumerist society while the rest of us perish in a constant state of self-doubt. But I knew I had his full attention, I was holding it, right in my left hand, now crossed behind my back with the right one, to cut the odds of him retrieving his phone. Which was, by the way, still talking. Let's all take a minute of silence for the poor guy amiably chatting with the air. \"You'd better start talking, Hawtrey.\" I growled between my teeth. \"I think you covered the talking part last night.\" \"I told you: what happened last night was…\" \"You have no clue what happened.\" \"Well how lucky you are: you can be useful for once in your life.\" \"Really? And you think between helping you nurture your fragile self-esteem and selling you out to your little friends to watch your team implode I would…?\" He chuckles. \"Come on, if you need hugs, call your mommy: don't impose your over sensitivity on us.\" \"This is the part of the evil laughter, right? Don't worry: I got the Cruella De Vil's downloaded on my phone.\" \"The truth is that you are a painfully emotional over-sharer when you're drunk, Sean.\" \"Stuart.\" \"No difference.\" \"I'll kill you.\" I stated, simply. \"I just know it. Don't know when or how, but I will.\" \"The usual, please.\" I inhaled and exhaled a few times while Cindy brought him his damn coffee and I cursed the heat because my glasses where ice skating towards the end of my nose. Suddenly, caffeine felt irrelevant. Not only I was fully awake and embracing the excitement of that horrible day, but I was also in a hunting mode. Too bad the clock was ticking and I had to remember that getting blackmailed wasn't as productive as attending class. \"My phone.\" That mellifluous British accent was really fuelling the waves of hatred I was keeping under the body temperature to avoid blowing up. Graham's open hand silently suggested it was time to cut it out. We both had a seminar to go to and opposite life values to comply with. But it wasn't over, that was sure. He knew that, not matter how well he pretended not to. I slipped out of the line into a sigh of temporary defeat while the guy at the bar started seeking attention: \"Sir? What can I give you, sir? Sir it's your turn, sir?\" I ignored him. I handed the phone back to his legitimate owner and looked that owner straight into his eyes: \"It wasn't your smartest movie, Graham.\" I warned him. \"Making things personal pushes people to unlucky places.\" \"Everything you need is in those pages, Sean.\" He replied, ending the call at last without much of a 'bye bye' to the poor man still hanging there. \"How much of a threat do you really think you are when you can't even find the courage to read them. Have a nice hangover.\" \"We're not done.\" \"We shouldn't even have started.\" \"Just so you know: only my parrot can call me Polly, alright?\" I managed to say, before we split our ways, regardless of the fact that we were heading in the exact same direction. He barely sniggered at me, walking away: \"You're embarrassing yourself.\" A/N We're getting there. Somewhere.

They didn't seem like your usual choice of Nooglers.\" The brunette spoke up as the room was cleared from the members of the Internship Program Committee. \"You weren't my usual choice either.\" The dark haired man turned, the left corner of his lips tilted upwards as he turned to face his colleague, before continuing with a slight shrug. \"It would be a test. We shall see where Lyle's sense of judgement would lead them.\" Turning back on his heels, the older male briskly left the meeting room with his head held high. The silence of the room was broken by a soft chuckle that resonated from the 21 year old brunette; her hands grabbed the documents before following suit. \"Lyle's sense of judgement when you were the deciding vote? Oh, Mr Chetty. As stubborn to admit taking a leap of faith as always, huh?\" Stuart's POV 1 Text Message Received. [Open] [Close] *Open* Good luck on your internship, my Stewy!

Another day, another text that would have killed my social life if anyone were to find it. Well, to clarify, it wasn't like I had much of one to begin with – unless we were bringing Facebook into the matter. Ever since I had broken the news to the folks on not returning home for the summer, texts like these had been coming in on a daily basis. It started out as calls, filled with tears of supposed joy and cheesy lines you could expect from a 80s film. Mum calmed down, albeit in the slightest way possible, but she had turned to texting. She had been my countdown clock for me, though I could've done that on my phone anyway. My fingers fiddled with the sleek interface of the gadget in my hands as the bus pulled over, revealing the magnificent structure that was Google Headquarters. My hand tugged on the luggage, taking in every inch of the environment as I could before my arrival to the registration counter. I was a geek. There was a reason why I was doing here in the first place, besides my intellectual abilities, obviously. But was I going to serve it on a silver platter for the fellow students to label me as they wished? No. The process at the counter was swift despite the overflowing number of interns in the building. See, this is the beauty of technology. Depositing my bag in the room assigned, my fingers intuitively checked in on FourSquare, checking updates on Instagram between the ten minutes that was spent in the process of registration. My feet brought itself to the direction of the assembly point before halting abruptly to the sound of squeaking from a female specie, and the contact of my chest to her shoulders. Documents which were undoubtedly in neat stacks were now spread around us in a sea of mess. My hands reached down to grab the pieces that were within my diameter before frantically checking the time on my phone. Only two minutes to get to the assembly point now. Mikaela's POV Today was just not my day. Actually, you know what? Every Noogler's program for the past four years had not been my day. Those computer geeks (yes, I know I'm one too) that spent way too long to get out of my way; busy ogling at the building, at their phones, at girls. My eyes rolled in annoyance as I stepped past a pair of older males, deep in discussion on the free cafeteria food that they were able to snagged before they were due to gather at the assembly point. Stacks of program information were in my arms, with not one gentleman in sight to provide the slightest assistance. Honestly, I'm no supermodel, but I am a lady still. Rushing through the impossible crowd were tough enough as it is without the load, imagine me with it. And I only have three minutes to get there now. Oh scratch that. Two minutes. \"Oof!\" The contact on my right shoulder resulted in flailing arms and flying papers. Papers flying in all directions. Papers that were supposed to be gathered and sent to the exact same assembly point in two minutes. Papers that… Surprisingly, were getting picked up by the culprit of the matter. My eyes glanced up at the boy as my hands busied itself in gathering the documents. An intern. For sure. Letting out a soft sigh, I took the papers from his hands before waving him off. \"Go on. I can do this by myself.\" His eyes darted, from the papers to me, then to the direction of the assembly point. His mouth opening to speak, before closing again when the words wouldn't spill. \"You only have a minute left. First impressions are important, you know? Now go, before I change my mind.\" Stuart's POV I didn't have to be told twice. At her confirmation, a soft mutter of apology escaped me as I sprinted to the hall. Slowing down as I approached the venue, taking a seat near the middle. \"Welcome to Google!\" The booming voice brought my attention away from my phone (totally not trying to stalk the previous girl on Facebook), a small smile crept up on my face in excitement before covering it up with my hands in an attempt to look inconspicuous. My hands were checking the email Mr. Chetty had mentioned when I caught a familiar figure scurrying in from the corner of my eyes. \"And this is a prime example of what NOT to do at Google. Disrupting an important announcement. Isn't that right, Ms. Marshall?\" The girl from before flashed a sarcastic smile before distributing the documents down the rows. \"What Ms Marshall is sending down now, are documents that you should read prior to the grouping. They are hints to the challenges that you may, or may not, be facing during your stay here.\" By now, my voice had blocked out most of the information that was just conveyed, as Ms Marshall stood beside me. \"Hey, I'm really sorry about before.\" I quickly started, taking a glance at the Head of Program before passing the documents down the line. \"Oh? Oh, it's you! Don't worry about it, always proud to be a prime example of something… Stuart.\" Her hand took hold of my pass, tilting her head as she gave a small smile before proceeding on. This day sure had started out interesting. Author's Note: Hi! It's me… AGAIN! This is a rather filler chapter just to introduce the character. Mikaela and Stuart will be far off from being so civil towards each other… Probably. Let me know what you think so far? :)[Chapter 2] Author's Note: ** STORY MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** I do not own any of the characters apart from my OC, Mikaela Kaitlyn Marshall. Information provided (about Google, etc.) may not be accurate, please do not regard them more than just a detail in the story. :) Thank you! Mikaela's POV Watching the chaos that was the grouping of interns could be ever so entertaining. Being involved as a Noogler and now overlooking the process after years in the job, had been refreshing. It was truly the first step to seeing a person's true colours. That was why Mr. Chetty had been keeping a keen eye on the process while I was lazing on the couch that faced the frenzied Nooglers. The motive for my presence in this year's Noogler's program had still been a mystery to everyone but the decision maker. The projects I'm involved in were coincidentally rearranged perfectly to fit this in my schedule. \" , I don't have… a team.\" Lyle's voice was enough to break through my train of thoughts as I made my way to the pair. My eyes widened at the words from the older male. \"Wait, what? Lyle is managing the leftovers? That's not fair.\" The terror in Lyle's eyes didn't help with my protest as his owl-like stare urged me to stop and run while I could. Lyle and I had started our career in Google at the same time… almost. I was a Noogler, he was… Speaking of which, how did he get into Google? I've got to remember to ask him later. Anyway, main point was that we were close friends. \"Well. Lyle's a first time manager; he's already at a disadvantage, grouping him with th-\" Oh. Uh oh. No good. Mr Chetty's amused expression told me he had anticipated the exact situation. He knew this was going to happen the moment he accepted the two sirs into the program. I mean. University of Phoenix? Who were they kidding? \"Since you have so kindly offered, you would be providing assistance to the group.\" My mouth was left hanging as I blinked once. Then twice. \"W-what? Hold it. You planned this! I can't manage a group!\" He was unfazed by my accusation, simply holding up his right hand, silencing my objections before continuing in a cool tone. Man, did I hate it when he does that. \"You said it yourself, they were at a disadvantage. They have two charity cases that most probably know nothing about… Well, anything. Do you really want to see Lyle struggle and fail ?\" \"…That's emotional blackmail.\" My eyes narrowed as Lyle desperately pulled me away from the scene, setting me in front of Billy and Nick. It wasn't long before I pulled away from Lyle's nervous ramble. It was awkward, and I want no part of it. \"Ms Mikaela Kaitlyn Marshall?\" The thick British accent sounded from beside, a tad too much if you asked me, but benefit of doubt, right? \"That's me. And you are…?\" With my hand outstretched in an instinctive corporate procedure, my eyes searched his for answers. \"I'm Graham Hawtrey. Such a pleasure to meet you! You were employed into Google at the age of 17?! That's incredible. And was offered a scholarship?\" By now my hands had retracted back to my sides, my eyes darted to Lyle for an escape at the commotion this guy had created on my behalf. It was even harder to miss the look of disgust plastered on Billy's face, which thankfully, was directed to the other party in question. \"Well, I…\" I started, though not knowing what to respond first. The information on my journey with Google wasn't something that I had wanted to be announced to an entire fleet of Nooglers. Heck, I barely mentioned them at all to my colleagues. These things cause friction in relationships, comparisons would be made and the next thing you know, everything gets complicated. \"Kaela's assisting my group in the process, because she's cool like a cucumber you know?\" A terrible phrase like that would usually make me cringe visibly, but now relief was apparent as I cringed inwardly instead. Graham hadn't bothered covering his displeasure as he took a step towards me, a smirk decorating his face. \"Assist them? Really? You know you can do better than that! Come on, join us instead! I would make us the top group at the end of the internship.\" Confidence was something that he had enough to share across the cohort. Better yet, give them to his fellow group mate who was now munching on his fifth croissant. My eyes quirked as I took a step closer, tugging up his pass as I did. \"Graham Hawtrey, huh. Well, if you have the ability to bring your group to the top, surely you are too good to be in need of my assistance.\" Letting go of his tag, my hand reached to give him a pat on the shoulder before walking off. \"Good luck balancing that head on those shoulders, Graham. Let's go, guys.\" There were times when I wished Lyle would stop talking, and there were times I wished he wouldn't. Today was one of the latter days. Eyes were on me as I fidgeted in the arm chair, uncomfortable with being the centre of attention after the previous display. \"No one touches Lyle on my watch.\" Breaking my silence, a glare was sent in Stuart's way as he merely scoffed at the comeback. \"Oh, really? That's the first thing you say after muting yourself?\" If looks could kill, and Stuart was a cat with nine lives, he would've died all nine times. \"Yes, and I will say it again. No one touches Lyle, or I will hit you where it hurts.\" … \"… WELL OKAY. My name is Neha…\" The introductions continued and so did the tension in the room. Neha didn't help with her… cosplay talk, which had only managed to turn my face crimson red at the explanation and her… uh. Fantasies. Billy and Nick didn't help with their questions towards Yoyo, and Stuart didn't (pfft surprising? Think not.) with his constant need to argue with… females. Silence ensued once again as the attention returned to me. \"What? I was sure that Graham dude said everything you needed to know about me already.\" … \"Okay. Fine. I'm Mikaela Kaitlyn Marshall. Been in Google the same time as Lyle, when I was 17, I-\" \"She was headhunted by Mr Chetty. Youngest intern he had ever employed.\" That proud smile of a father's had somehow found its way to Lyle as the curly haired boy interrupted my introduction. \"Yea, well, didn't want to divulge that information.\" A stern stare at the older male had him muttering a soft apology before I sighed in defeat. \"Anyway, you guys can call me by my name or Micky, Kaela, KK, the nicknames are pretty endless and I'm generally fine with most of them. That's all.\" \"Well great. Translation lecture is up in 15, let's go Team Lyle!\" Up until now, the greatest team spirit we have had was the united silence we hold towards Lyle. Author's Note: Reviews, pretty please? Oh, and suttonsay, thank you for being my first reviewer!

Seating: | Yoyo | Lyle | Nick | Billy | Neha | Stuart | Mikaela | Stuart's POV Someone translate this lecture into something more interesting. That, or at least silence the people two seats down. The furious typing from my left was almost calming while my hands toyed with my phone, feeling it vibrate as a message notification flickered on my screen. 1 Text Message Received.

My fingers reached to the familiar delete icon – something that was instinctive when it comes to messages from my parents, before I even type out my reply. Only, this time, before my thumb could give a soft tap on the screen, my phone was tugged out of my hands, earning a Chromebook on my lap in exchange. \"Hey, give that back!\" In harsh whisper, my hand reached out to Mikaela who had leaned back in retaliation, stretching the hand with my phone in it further away from my reach. \"Not until the lecture is over. Seriously, you guys are the interns, why am I doing your work while your team manager is stalking the girl of his dreams. Now type.\" Her finger pointed to the laptop as my phone was brought to her lap. Her fingers visibly reaching for the lock button, before the unfortunate happened. \"Oh my go- Is this you? You were so cute!\" She gushed, as quietly as her excitement could let her, while my face went into a dark shade of red. But wait, did she just… \"Cute? You think I'm cute?\" My fingers tapped furiously on the keyboard, taking note of the lecture while sparing glances to the girl beside. Her eyes rolled good-naturedly before hitting reply on my screen and started her own typing. What is she doing?! \"Don't get ahead of yourself. I said 'were'. And… Yes, this is a great picture.\" My eyes darted up in time to see her lowering my phone, undoubtedly catching me on camera while my attention wasn't on her. \"Didn't anyone tell you it's rude to snap someone's photo without permission? And using their phones?\" My hand swiftly reached up to the phone, passing the Chromebook to Neha as my eyes widened with the deed that was done. \"Oops, too late.\" Mikaela, with her hair that smelled amazingly like flowers, leaned towards me as she peered over to look at the screen of the phone.

Do NOT tell anyone about this or I will lock you in a room with Graham.\" My glare complement with the threat as I typed a quick response before any wild imaginations get the chance to develop further in the older woman's mind.

Her eyebrows quirked and arms rested lazily on her lap, leaning back in her seat. In that moment, I could only blink. Saying it was awkward getting caught staring was an understatement, and it usually result to a foolish action. \"I would. But I'm afraid my phone might break down from the mere image of a virus.\" Her laughter to my comment was surprising, and even more surprising as she stood from her seat, her head jerked towards the entrance. \"Lecture ended. Let's go, big guy\" Walking past me, the girl slipped a soft whisper of \"little Stewy\" before turning back to face me, walking backwards as she did. The same cheeky grin decorated her face, against my annoyed one, a playful wink to show she had something to use against me before turning forward again. I watched as her right arm enveloped Lyle into a side hug and my mind was imprinted with the last image of her. Damn, that wink. [1 Message Unread] She? Her? OH MY, STEWY BABY. YOU MET A GIRL?

Information provided (about Google, etc.) may not be accurate, please do not regard them more than just a detail in the story. :) Thank you! Mikaela's POV Being on the internship program was tougher than I had expected, especially with the amount of projects I have already been put in. Although I must admit, this had been easier to juggle in comparison to when school term starts. Being in Stanford didn't qualify for me to slack off either, and with work on hand to complete, it could get crazy. Right after the lecture (still pretty amused at the Stuart saga), one of my project team leaders had called for an emergency meeting in half an hour. Gathering my documents as soon as I could, I had only managed to locate Lyle with the three young interns before rushing off to the room. My phone that was tightly held in my hands vibrated just as I reached the building. 1 New Friend Request. Stuart Twombly [Confirm] [Not Now] *Confirm* Mikaela Marshall Trying to stalk me, huh? Stuart Twombly I'm sure that would be what you would like this to be. Mikaela Marshall But of course, who wouldn't be ecstatic about cute little Stewy stalking them? Stuart Twombly …I am this close to giving Graham your number. Mikaela Marshall First of all, you don't have my number. Secondly… Who said he didn't have it already? Stuart Twombly Wait, he doesn't, does he? Stuart Twombly Kaela? Mikaela Marshall Meeting started. Stuart Twombly Damn it. THE NEXT DAY (still Mikaela's POV) It was a curse. That was my first thought when the challenge was issued, and everyone was doing their part to contribute for the task. Well, not everyone. \"God, I feel like murdering someone right now.\" I muttered under my breath, trying with every inch of me to block the gibberish nonsense that the two idiots were rambling on about. \"If you have decided on that, can pick one of the two as your target?\" My eyes widened at Yoyo, who spoke in response to my annoyance, his face twisting in irritation, almost mirroring my very expression. It wasn't till Yoyo's outburst that the two had stopped, and… \"Don't! My gosh. Use a rubbing alcohol to get rid of permanent ink. That's common knowledge.\" My hands reached out in futile efforts at Billy, who had used his saliva to wipe the glass, and if it wasn't obvious, I have that panel of glass committed to memory and am never stepping anywhere near it again. Having been beside Lyle the whole time to work on the strategizing, I sat on the nearest armrest while Stuart plopped down on the same seat, with my back facing him. Enthusiasm in their little story was only apparent in the pair as the rest of us tried (and failed) to digest their illogical little fairytale. \"Guys…\" My arm flew up to stop Lyle from continuing when the Nooglers came up with their own version of story to distract the pair from us, that being said, they were sent to Stanford in search for a fictional character. That should give us enough time. \"Okay time to work. Stuart? Feel free to get your hands off my thigh now.\" Somehow, during the course of distraction, the brown haired boy had rest his arms around the chair which he and I were both seated on. His hands landing on my thigh at the action. \"W-wha..\" His hand withdrew as quickly as his eyes made contact with the situation, face reddening slightly while he diverted his fluster to the code in hand. \"Lyle? What's wrong?\" My hands continued the scribbling on the glass (with whiteboard marker, for goodness sake), my eyes flickered to my partner. His face scrunched before his mouth opened, words that rolled off his tongue held a tinge of disappointment. \"You weren't supposed to do that. To… To push them away like the other interns. You're a team manager too, you are supposed to help them. We were supposed to help them. Just because they know nuts about these things, doesn't mean we should just… just…\" Upon his speech, I could only watch. He was right, like always. Lyle had always played the part of conscience in our friendship. While I had no trouble doing what I just did, or hadn't done, he would be the voice of justice. The pang of guilt hit me harder than I would have expected before closing the cap of my marker, and grabbing my bag from the table. \"Wait, where are you going?\" Stuart's voice called out just when I reached the exit of the room. \"I'm going to find and bring the two idiots back.\" HALF AN HOUR LATER You know, despite it being my school, it was still a pain to locate two person out of the students that were there for Summer Programs. I had tried asking around, specifically for two old guys who obviously did not attend school here nor looked like they were capable of teaching the syllables, and no one had the answer. By now, my feet had went from casual strolling to brisk walking and somehow a feeling tugged inside me that told me I may be sprinting soon. \"Professor Xavier?\" That voice. That loud voice that one could probably (unfortunately) hear from blocks down the street. My head spun in the direction, my eyes squinted in the afternoon sun to locate the pair. While they approached the professor in a wheelchair, my feet took off into the sprint that was apparently anticipated. \"No, don't. Guys he's no- Oh my god.\" The sprinting came to a slow jog giving my mind the time to process the situation. Wheelchair professor had just punched the both of them… One of whom got punched in a place no guys should be punched. My lips pursed, cringing at the inevitable pain before resuming my run to the old men. \"Oh God. Are you guys okay? I mean. I guess not, but. Oh God. W.. What do you guys need? Ice? Do you guys need ice? Because I can go get them.\" The words came out in the form of a nervous ramble with my hands hanging in the air in front of me, absolutely clueless on what I ought to be doing to help. Their struggled nod gave me the sign I need to get ice from the cafeteria, before rushing back by the two. After what seemed like eternity for the males beside me, we managed to get back into the car that I had borrowed from Sid, with Billy volunteering to drive us back. I took the back seat while Nick sat in the passenger seat, still icing his… uh. Injury . Silence filled the car as we drove on, the awkward tension increasing by the second. \"You guys can… You know. Switch on the radio with that button.\" My voice started soft, immense guilt still coursing through me. Nick reached for the button, stopping mid-way when Billy spoke up. \"No it's fine. We can talk instead.\" I fidgeted uncomfortably in my seat at his words before giving a soft hum to signify my agreement to the suggestion. After what had happened, I owe them this much, right? \"What do you think of us? Be honest.\" His question was genuine, and the sincerity of it all left me dumbstruck. As much as I wondered what had earned their spot in the program out the thousands of others out there, I wasn't near that heartless to give them the honest review of their performance. \"I…\" I trailed off, catching my lower lip in between my teeth while I thought of what to say. \"It's okay. We understand.\" Nick replied, donning a kind smile. I blinked once, then twice, before submitting to staring at my fiddling fingers that rested on my lap. Like a kid caught red-handed. \"Don't look like that. Don't feel bad about it, we understand, really.\" Billy started, looking at me via the rear view mirror before continuing. \"You know. We used to be good at something. Nick and I.\" The comment gained a chuckle from Nick, and a small smile escaped my lips at their interaction. \"Oh yeah? Tell me about it.\" Speaking up with a little more confident than before, my eyes flickered between the two curiously. No one had actually asked about how they ended up auditioning for the internship, now that I think about it. \"You see. We were full time salesmen for watches… and part time cavemen as you've already witnessed. Our company closed down just when we were closing a deal, one that we thought would be the deal, you know?\" A mere nod of my head in acknowledgement was all that was required in our conversation. The slightest sign of understanding allowed the man to continue. \"When it did… Honestly, we lost everything. I lost my girlfriend and house, he… He had to work under a guy who had the most stupid tattoo on his face.\" \"Neck, actually.\" \"Well, same thing Nick. They are both places where a tattoo shouldn't be placed.\" Laughter erupted in the car, the tension dissipating. My eyes held empathy and concern before enquiring further. \"So you guys applied for this internship? Even if you didn't know anything about it? Why?\" It took longer than a few seconds before Nick had composed his thoughts and responded, a tone softer than when the conversation started. \"It was our last chance, you know? To do something different? To be someone different? We aren't young like you guys. You guys are smart, you are young. You have a bright future ahead of you. And I believe I speak for both Billy and I when I say that we are proud to have you all as our team members. Regardless what Graham thinks.\" Now, I wasn't always emotional. In fact, I was hardly, ever emotional or have tears pooling in my eyes. But I did. In that moment, I did. I flashed a wry smile before wiping them off with the back my hands, laughing at my own actions. \"You know. I was an outcast when I joined the Noogle program too.\" I looked up at the pair, a bashful grin on my face as I started telling my own story. \"When I was 17, I was a typical, bored teenager who finds rules to break in their free time. My dad was a software engineer, so I did grow up in such an environment. Well, long story short, I got caught for hacking into Google, and at that time, Mr Chetty had just been put in charge for the internship program. When he heard my case, he suggested for them to put me into it to see my potential rather than legal actions. It was a good thing I merely hacked into it and didn't do anything too destructive.\" I observed their reaction for a split second before continuing. \"I was like you guys during group pairing day. No one wanted a teenager with no official certificate for their supposed skills. I was in the team of outcast. Come to think of it, Lyle might have been on my team…\" I trailed off at the thought before snapping back to the story. \"Oh, we won by the way. That was why I'm here today and had been for the past four years. I got offered a fully paid scholarship to study at Stanford, which I am doing now, like Stuart, Yoyo, and Neha. It would be my senior year when I go back as well. But… it's tough. Impressive as it may sound, it was… depressing at the beginning. Being in the industry at such a young age, people just don't treat you with as much importance, you know? I had to earn that harder than the rest.\" Gazing out the window to see the Google headquarters, with Sid at the entrance, my hand did a little wave before hopping out the car just when it stopped. \"Thanks Sid.\" My arms reached out for a firm hug before facing my team mates. \"Well, let's go have lunch! I've heard your conversation on the first day about the free food. So we shall stuff ourselves with them.\" Hooking my arms with theirs, we made our way back into the building. The trip from the cafeteria to the benches was actually fun. Nick had tried to subtlety enquire about Dana, while I reciprocated by pretending I didn't know his true intentions. The laughter came to an abrupt stop when Stuart's voice sounded, evidently proud of the prank that we had pulled together. \"Guys…\" When Yoyo and Stuart had pretty much rejected them off the table, my voice reflected those of Lyle's when we had first started the prank. \"I'll go with you guys.\" My feet followed the two men only to be stopped by Nick. \"No, nono, it's okay Kaela. I'm sure the seat was reserved for you.\" His head jerked to the empty space between Neha and Stuart, flashing a strained smile. \"W-wait. Go sit with that guy with the headphones. He wouldn't mind.\" Their eyes searched the crowd for the character in question, frowning in confusion before deciding it was safe to heed my advice. \"Didn't know you are all goody with them now.\" Stuart teased as I settled for the space in between. My fork poked around my food, before popping a meatball in my mouth. \"They're not that bad…\" Stuart jerked back at the sentence, the contorted expression reflected in all three interns, and a smile from Lyle. \"You guys... Even though they didn't know anything, they did still try to help. Yea, they said a whole bunch of gibberish at the start, but they went to an unfamiliar place, to look for a total stranger because they trusted our words. And they really wanted to do something for the team. Lyle and I should've provided them the lessons to make up for their lacking knowledge.\" My shoulders slumped at my own incompetence, suddenly losing all appetite for a proper meal. \"Kaela…\" Neha started, before letting out a groan. \"What does Graham want now?\" She continued. My vision followed hers to Nick and Billy's table, eyes narrowing. Stuart's hand rested on my shoulder, pushing me back down on my seat while observing the situation. \"It's okay. He's probably just bragging about the win. They can handle themselves, don't worry.\" The words that escaped his lips were an almost whisper, loud enough probably only for myself. …. Wait. \"Wait, his team won the challenge?! Ugh. I mean, I didn't expect us to win with such a handicap. But them winning just infuriates me.\" By now, my arm was resting on the table, the palm of my hands supported the weight of my head with my eyes keeping constant contact to the other table. \"Oh right, Kaela. Tomorrow's challenge is sports. Muggle Quidditch to be exact. Get ready your sports attire. Becaues we have an extra member, you will substitute one of the two.\" Lyle spoke up as his attention went back to the Chromebook. \"Tomorrow? I can't, I have a sales meeting. And you know how these things are, I don't know what time I'll be done. I'm sure they will do fine. Billy has that height advantage over the rest.\" I replied, apologetically, as Stuart's head lolled back in a familiar gesture. All the rest seemingly submitting to a defeat before the match had even begun. Well, guess we'll see how they do. Author's Note: As usual, reviews and let me know what you think! :) suttonsays: You said it, I heard it! Although, I still am working on it because writing long chapters still needs a little getting used to. Hope this chapter is okay though! Guest: Hahaha, ain't she lovely? :)[Chapter 5] Author's Note: ** STORY MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** I do not own any of the characters apart from my OC, Mikaela Kaitlyn Marshall. Information provided (about Google, etc.) may not be accurate, please do not regard them more than just a detail in the story. :) Thank you! Stuart's POV You know how sometimes, you get that feeling of absolute despair at the things that were going on in your current state of life, to the point of which you sincerely believed nothing could be worse anymore? Well, it can. It's always the case, no matter how rock bottom you were feeling in that moment. Trust me; I'm experiencing that first hand, right now. Saying the match was horrendous, was an understatement. We were being completely smashed and the game had only just started. As the Facebook message from Mikaela came in, with words of encouragement and enthusiasm for the team, my fingers instinctively reached out to respond with a snarky comment only for my head to be smacked during the game. It wasn't my fault the ball got taken away anyway, looking at the rate the game had been progressing, losing that one ball probably did no worse than it could. The half time whistle rang out just as we were down by 7 goals… It might have been better if we had scored at least once. But we didn't. My hands reached to the top of my head, pulling off the beanie that had not been helping with the sweltering heat, before throwing it down beside. Defeat, I've accepted it. There was no way we were going to win, I mean, just look at my team! And of course, the life lessons of Billy and Nick would come in a form of a 80s movie. It had always been an old-school reference when it came to the two of them. My eyes rolled back before glancing straight ahead, trying to block out as much nonsensical attempt of boosting team morale as I could. My breath hitched in my throat, and I was pretty sure my heart skipped a beat as an arm slung across my shoulders; the other had its fingers twirling my beanie. The familiar floral scent filled me as I looked to my left at the brunette, in her skinny jeans and loose graphic tank top, who had the biggest grin on her face. The only grin in our team actually. I honestly do not have the slightest clue as to how she was doing this. Maybe she was the only pretty (gorgeous, really, but let's not tell her that) girl who would understand anything that comes out my mouth. Because she was as dorky as I am, maybe? Because… Maybe I have a chance? … Wait, that came out of nowhere. Of course I didn't like her that way. She's infuriating. I mean, yea, I preferred to hang out with her compared to anyone in the group, and we were comfortable around each other although all we did were fun bickers. But I didn't mind since she had a nice voice… and face… and hair… and… Oh God, what's happening to me? \"I saw the score. Man, you guys are really bad at this, aren't you?\" Mikaela's teasing voice cut short the giant's story, as her head tilted towards my shoulders. She wasn't that tall, or short. Average, really. If she had tilted a little further, her head would probably have nicely reached my shoulder. Her fingers continued twirling the beanie as my eyes watched her new toy swirling in the sunlight. \"Kaela! Join the game!\" Neha's voice almost sounded like a miracle had just appeared in our eyes. I observed as the girl beside me shifted her weight uncomfortably, before giving a shy smile. \"I… I can't. I'm horrible at sports. I…\" Her bottom lip was caught between her teeth and she flushed at her confession. Surely I'm not going to let this chance slip me by? \"Oh, Ms Perfect has something she's weak at? That can't be!\" Mikaela's eyes glared dangerously towards me upon those words, her harsh exterior contrasting my grinning one. \"Looking at the score board, you don't seem like you're any better at it.\" Her sharp retort turned my victorious expression into a frown almost instantaneously, my previous grin made its appearance on the girl's face instead. \"Well, right. Kaela? Uh, Billy and I had somehow forgotten a tiiiiinnnnyyy detail that involves you.\" Nick's expression had exposed his lie; everyone could sense that the detail was probably not as tiny as he had hoped. Mikaela's arm removed its presence on my shoulder as she stood up straighter. Her inquiry of the supposed tiny detail came out in a whisper. \"You see, that day during lunch…\" Billy started, giving a cautious glance at the brunette before shifting her attention to Nick to continue. \"Graham had a bet with us… But! You must know that we had utmost confidence in our team so we made it.\" With her brows creasing at the roundabout way of confessing their doing, she urged them to continue. \"We may have… Kinda… Maybe…\" \"OH MY GOD, JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU GUYS DID.\" It was almost amusing to watch Mikaela's outburst, resulting in the grin I had at the scene in front of me. \"… You have a date with Graham if we lose this match.\" The silence that came after was ironically deafening. My smile disappeared at the words, eyes taking a side glance to see Graham smirking towards us. No doubt he had figured out what was being said on this side of the field. \"BUT we have something that we think would work against them.\" Breaking the ice and a new found motivation for winning crept in as we huddled together for the new strategies. When the whistle sounded again signalling the end of half time break, I turned towards the field only to have a hand tugging my arm. \"Look Stuart, you are the most athletic and best hope I have on this team, as much as I hate to admit it.\" Mikaela started, her eyes almost pleading. \"Win this, okay? I don't want to go out with him.\" My arms now folded across my chest while I donned my own smirk, satisfied at the fact that she was asking me for help. It wasn't like I would let her go on that date anyway, but… \"Huh? And what would I gain from that? Besides, didn't he already have your number? A date is just a step forward, no?\" Her hands toyed with my beanie, before lifting it above her head and pulling it down. She was wearing my beanie. I'm pretty sure I would have been gawking if she wasn't right in front of me, scrutinizing me with her narrowed eyes. \"He doesn't have my number. I was just kidding the other day. But…\" Her voice trailed off as her hand swiftly reached up to the back of my neck, pulling me down till I was at the same level as she was. \"I will give you mine if you win this?\" I could only curl my hands into fists when that soft whisper echoed in my ears. … I'm sure she knew what she was doing to me. \"Is that flirting I sense?\" Trying to remain as calm as I could, although the rapid heartbeats were proving otherwise, I managed one last response before she pulled away, walking backwards like she had after our translation lecture. \"Who knows?\" The same wink, the same cheeky grin, the same girl. I shook my head in an attempt to rid the image of her in my mind, now with my beanie on her to boot while I got in line with the rest. I need to concentrate on winning the game… and getting her number. Wait no. Just winning the game, because… Because I want to win. Yup, that's it. Lyle leaned towards me in my ready stance, new found determination reflecting in my very expression. \"Someone's got a crush on Kaela~\" Speaking softly in a singsong voice, his eyes flicked from mine to the girl on the side lines who had now borrowed (or stolen, judging by the angry looks) pompoms to aid her cheering. That simple action put an involuntary smile on my face, only to bolster Lyle's statement. Mikaela's POV Did I just… flirt… with Stuart? I think I did. I wasn't sure. It kinda just came out the way it did and… Well, let's just say I don't have a lot of experience in the flirting department. I think he wasn't appalled by it? Was he? I mean, he didn't look like he was… but Lyle spoke something to him and now both of them are looking in my direction. Oh God, were they talking about that little chat? My panicked mode was getting worse by the second; I needed something to distract them and myself with. So really, you couldn't blame me when I snatched those pompoms from the cheerleaders of the other team. My voice was loud, and overly excited, I'm guessing. Looking at the scoreboard, Mr Chetty's questioning look towards me, his unconvinced look when I tried to flash my best smile and well, just all the exaggerated motions in hopes that I could cover up for the embarrassment I feel. The bet about Graham had shook me up quite a bit back there, and really, I would rather have it been a bet with Stuart instead. And that would have been an insulting comparison for Stuart, really. Graham was filled with motives; I could see it in his eyes. How he scrutinizes the people around before he approached them, trying to balance out if they were worth his time, if they had any use for him. Unluckily for me, I had caught his eyes while observing the match. His wink was returned with the roll of my eyes, and an absolutely mature tongue that stuck out towards him. I couldn't say the same about his smug attitude once the second half of the game started though. My feet were bouncing up and down at each goal, voice screaming like a little girl at her first concert before flailing the pompoms around frantically at my team who was turning the game around by the head. At Stuart's blocking of the incoming shot though, you could imagine the adrenaline that was coursing through me at the point in time. Hence, I refuse to admit to the following statement that I had shouted out during then. \"YES! STUART, YOU AWESOME, SNARKY, CUTIE PATOOTIE YOU.\" My wish for the last part to go unheard was hopeless considering what loud voice I unfortunately had when I wanted to. Graham had looked over at me the same time Stuart had. One with the dirty looks, and the other with a smirk and wink. I think it's fairly obvious which belonged to whom. During the tie, golden boy who came dancing out had most likely been the most obscene thing I've witnessed this year. I cringed at the sight before leaning towards Sid as he sniggered at my reaction. \"Sid, don't we have enough funds to get Snitch boy a new costume? A less disturbing looking one, perhaps?\" His snigger now erupted as laughter before halting abruptly by the sound of an injury case. Weird, they weren't even playing; they were all as distracted by their new company to continue the game. Of course, soon the mystery was unravelled by the result of the Snitch competition. My pompoms were left on the ground, and I found myself beside Sid in record time. Eyes widened and finger pointing at the Graham before frantically trying to get Sid to change the winner. \"But Sid! He blagged1 Billy! That's against the rules; you have to call off that Snitch!\" I was pleading, begging, even. Stuart had to grab me by the shoulders towards the group due to my persistence towards Sid's helplessness in the matter. \"Kaela, we're sorry. We shouldn't have made that bet.\" Nick apologetic voice reached me first before I lifted my chin. The team must have felt worse than me; they were the ones who had fought so hard in the game, while I just cheered. \"No, it's not your fault. You had faith that we would win after all and… Yoyo, stop it. What are you doing?!\" My hand gripped Yoyo's wrist when he… I really don't know what he was doing, but it didn't look fun. \"Oh you weren't here. He plucks his eyebrows to… in his words, punish himself for his inferiority.\" Stuart replied with his arms casually slung over my shoulders while his hand made me release my grip on Yoyo. Speaking of, when did Stuart get his new found confidence, enough to sling his arms over my shoulders without permission? Lyle seemed to have noticed this too… and Neha… and really, everyone besides Yoyo who had stopped \"punishing\" himself at Billy's words. Steered by the shoulders to escape the sight of Graham, and his sight of us, Stuart urged me to brisk walk through the mass of interns before we could be stopped. We weren't stopped, but we were spotted. \"Hey! 7pm, tonight.\" My shoulders slumped in defeat and my left hand reached up to give a nonchalant wave. There was no way I was going to turn back to witness the arrogant look that was undoubtedly plastered on his face. \"… So you're going?\" The voice was quiet, brown orbs looking down on me. \"I guess? We both know he'll never give it up. Might as well get it over with.\" The only response I got was a soft 'oh', before my hands reached his, removing its presence over my shoulders. His expression went from shock, to confusion, and to embarrassment in the span of seconds. \"I- I'm sorry, it's just that… Mr Chetty wouldn't be happy if he saw it… You're still under the Noogler program after all.\" Truth be told, I had missed the warmth as soon as I removed it, it felt… pretty comfortable. … Wow, it's scarier when I hear myself think out loud at that idea. He merely nodded as we sat down with our food at the cafeteria, his hands toying with his phone again before setting it down on the table. My eyes kept in contact with his phone, while poking around my food. Glancing up at an absentminded Stuart, the phone was in my hands after a swift grab from across the table. \"Kaela. Give it back. I told you it is rude t-\" Before he could finish his sentence though, I had shoved the phone back in the palm of his hands, my mission was done. \"Did you… Is this…? But why? We didn't win the game.\" His eyes were glued to the digits that were now on the screen of his phone, lips twitching at the corners before looking up at me with a tilt of his head. \"Oh you're right. Maybe I should just delet-\" My hands reached towards the opposite side of the table, and he scooted his chair back immediately, phone pulling away from my reach before making a quick save of the number on his phone. \"So… I heard someone calling me a cutie patootie just now.\" I could feel the heat of my face as my eyes snapped up to meet his, my mouth opened before curling back into a tight purse. \"Well… you must've heard wrong. Or the person who said that had to get her eyes checked. Or it was the girl behind me. Or beside. Or… OH, look at the time. Time to go! Cheerio!\" Words rolled off my mouth on cue with whatever that came to my mind first, feet lifting myself off the seat before rushing out the cafeteria only to have footsteps and chuckling sounding right behind me. \"Cheerio? Really?\" At that comment, came the urge to dig a hole to crawl in it. I would never come out from there again. \"But if it helps, I think you're a cutie patootie too, as you like to call it.\" The statement was almost inaudible, against my ears. I could feel his breathing as the words came, my head spun back in reaction only to catch him walking away. As if sensing my gaze, Stuart turned back towards me, never stopped moving off in the opposite direction while he did, before shooting me a playful wink. … Dude, that was my move. LATER THAT NIGHT (still Mikaela's POV) \"Nope, never Stewy.\" This was probably the first time I had ever been glad to receive a project, or in this case, a Noogler challenge at night. The 'date' with Graham was rescheduled, and I was at least free for one more night. Paired with my new found freedom and the older males' utter hopelessness in apps and technology, I had to hide myself behind the computer screen due to the immense amusement I was trying to keep down. Until the topic of employment was brought up, of course. Lyle settled for the seat beside mine as we looked awkwardly at each other. It was never a comfortable topic for the both of us. While the others fret about the 'American Dream', we were living it. Almost. Google wise, at least. We were young too; I am even the same age as the younger interns in our group. I couldn't stop fidgeting in my seat as the conversation continued; it was as if by doing so I can get my emotional discomfort out. Lyle reached his hand out to mine and gave it a reassuring squeeze. All I could do was squeeze back, knowing that he was feeling the same unease as I was at the pessimism in the room. We knew that whatever we try to say, it would backfire. After all, it was harder for our words of encouragement to be taken in better light by others. We had both learned that the hard way. Our hands remained that way, and Stuart's death stare on it remained fixated as well. It had taken me minutes before I realised his eyes on them, his eyes flickered up to meet my confused ones. The intense staring was getting awkward, and I wiggled my hands out of Lyle's before turning back to the screen. If they had taken the liberty to send us their app without us having to dig for it, surely we could do something more with the information than moan about their efficiency? \"What are you doing?\" Billy's voice called out from behind me, head bending down to stare at my screen. \"I'm on the backend system of Google, getting the downloaders' demographics for the other team's apps. Since they had so kindly linked us, I figured we could use the information to decide whom we want ours to target.\" Without a look spared to the man behind, my fingers danced on the keyboard before an arm snaked around my waist and my body was lifted off the chair. \"H-hey! I was in the middle of that!\" My arms flailed frantically at the sudden loss of ground. \"Damn it, stop moving.\" Stuart's voice rang out before my feet landed back on the ground, his eyes narrowing down at me. \"Billy and Nick insisted on going out and made me get you.\" It was all he said before walking off without me, eyes resuming focus on his phone. Guys do have serious mood swing problems too, don't they? \"Psst… Lyle, what is he saying?\" My head leaned towards the curly haired boy as Billy interacted with the staff and customers at the Chinese restaurant. Stuart had so far, managed to avoid all eye contact and conversations with me, and managed to sit on the opposite end of the table. Eyes narrowing at his habit and close relationship with his phone, I could only accomplish an annoyed eye roll before picking my own and sending a text to him. 1 Message Sent Hey, update me on something. Why are you ignoring me again? [Reply] [Close] [Delete] Putting the phone back in the pocket of my jeans, my eyes observed the boy opposite. His eyes widened slightly at his phone, before chewing the inside of his mouth and… not reply me. I groaned inwardly before adjusting his beanie that was on my head. I've got it; surely he would want it back? He would have to be near me to do that, at least I could use that chance to make him talk… If he did actually want it back, that was. Reaching out for the bottle of beer, I took it in gulps before Lyle stopped me with a push of my hand. \"Kae, you're drinking it too fast! You will get drunk easier like that. It's your first time drinking, so chill out on it.\" A groan left my lips before nodding at Lyle, shifting his hand away so I could resume. I wanted to say I could've sworn Stuart had finally spared me a glimpse in that moment but really, it might just have been something that was at the top of his screen. One way or another, we ended up in a club. A supposed dance club. But I don't think dance clubs looked like these. I haven't been in one before but… I think… We were in a strip club instead. \"Lyle…\" Uncertainty resonated in my voice, only to go unheard, his attention landed on the hostess and… Oh. My eyebrows rose at Stuart and their interesting interaction, feeling a sudden need for more alcohol during the walk to the table. The discomfort of being in such an environment escaped me while I took the seat furthest from Stuart, beside Nick at the edge of the half round couch. Yoyo's concerns had barely reached me as I grabbed a hold of the shot, downing it while Nick and Billy were in the middle of convincing. Their eyes widened at me cringing while the burn of the alcohol trailed down my throat, feeling the effects of it before breaking out into laughter at my first experience of shots. \"THAT. WAS. AWESOME.\" Yoyo had seemed to have taken my first step as a motivation when he downed his, the table erupting in full blown hysteria. I wasn't sure how much I had drank; only Lyle's constant failed attempts at making me stop. The lap dances didn't do well for my alcohol intake either. I stumbled out of the booth without the group's notice, all too focused on the activity that was going on there. Even Stuart. Actually, especially Stuart since he was the 'lucky' one, apparently. But not that it was any of my business. It wasn't like I liked him, or that I was jealous. Or that I was going to the bar to down more alcohol without Lyle's nagging because I was overwhelmed with jealousy at the scene. … Ugh, Stuart's an idiot. Everything reached a point of fuzziness after some time at the bar. And the dance floor, and back at the bar. I was giggling, I felt light, although my feet didn't seem to work with myself as well as it did before we reached the club. \"Hey gorgeous, can I buy you a drink?\" My head turned lazily to the source of a voice, head tilting as I smiled at the man. He had ginger hair, and green orbs that never left my brown ones while he put on a sweet smile of his own. We were both on our sides, leaning against the bar counter, his hand extended while his introduction came. \"I'm Alexander, or just Alex would do.\" Raising my brows at his outstretched hand, my hand reached out to shake it. \"Mikaela.\" His grin stretched wider at my response, before bringing my hands to his lips. As if on cue, a familiar voice cut the interaction between us, hand pulling mine back from Alex's lips. \"Actually I think she's had enough to drink.\" My brows furrowed once again at the body that stood between the stranger and I, the broad shoulders clothed in a plain colored shirt. \"Hey… We were talking.\" My words were slurred and my attempt at pushing the figure away was feeble. Alex poked his head around the obstruction. \"No, it's alright, Mikaela. He's right. Here, I'm going to give you my number, maybe we can hang sometime?\" I waved Alex goodbye, leaning my back on the counter while I stared blankly at the number on the paper. I wasn't registering the details at all, but I just got a number. Somehow. The paper was snatched out of my sight almost immediately and thrown in my leftover drink. My head spun (a bad decision with the alcohol) and dizziness hit me like a bullet. My body swayed as I lifted my arms to keep my balance, giggling at my own silliness. \"I need to find Alex. His number's all drenched now…\" Fingers curling around the glass, my eyes carefully observed the contents, my mind wasn't in the right state and somehow the drenched paper looked really interesting. \"Damn it. How much have you drank? You just go around letting guys offer you drinks? How many numbers have you received? Or gave? Do you know how dangerous it is for you to wander around on your own in a strip club?!\" The booming voice of the intruder caused a series of pain to my head, my hands reached out to hold it, trying to subside it while backing away from the source. My backing away, and my feet's new found incapability to listen, turned into stumbling. Hands gripped onto my shoulders to stabilize me while my eyes took more than a moment to digest the brown eyes that were now staring at me in concern. \"Oh heyyyyy Stuart. Did you enjoy your lap dance? Sorry I couldn't stay to watch.\" Even in a drunken state, the comment was still laced full of sarcasm. \"Oh, I did dance around though. Maybe I should go dance now too…\" My feet were beginning to step towards the dance floor before being tugged back forcefully by Stuart. \"No, you shouldn't. Did anyone touch you?! Because I swear if they did, I wou–\" \"You would what? Get more lap dances? Ignore me further with no explanation? Intrude another of my conversation with someone who actually bothered talking to me?\" My glare met his shocked gaze, searching my eyes for something, a hint that I was just playing, teasing, joking. My hands went over his to loosen his grip only for it to be tightened some more. \"…Well, maybe if you hadn't been all touchy feely with Lyle, I wouldn't have ignored you! Or get that lap dance!\" There goes the booming voice again. My head throbbed and my eyes squeezed shut at the pain in my head before reaching my hand up again to cup it. \" I… I'm sorry. I just… You and Lyle… The hand holding. So I…\" That, I've heard. My reaction? Scoffing at Stuart's comment, pushing his hands harshly off me before stumbling in the other direction of the club, towards the alternative bar. \"Yea, because hand holding and lap dancing are totally in the same league.\" \"Kaela… Kaela! Stop wandering off on your own! I've searched for you for the past hour, do you know how worried I was?!\" I didn't plan to stop, not until I saw Lyle with Marie… or Marielena to be exact. My feet were glued to the spot and I could only stare blankly at the pair, still taking some time to digest the situation. \"Kae? Don't scare me, are you alright? Do you feel dizzy? I can bring you out for some fresh air if it would make you feel better?\" Stuart's voice brought me back as I pointed at Lyle, a silly smile decorating my face. \"Lyle finally talked to his crush!\" Gushing like how I did at Stuart's younger photo, the boy while holding me close by my shoulders looked towards the direction before dipping his head down to catch me eye. \"Wait, Lyle's crush? So you two… you two aren't? But the hand holding…\" \"Shut up Stewy, I'm watching them talk.\" \"No, Kaela, I need to know. Talk to me first… Please?\" Ugh, who could resist those puppy eyes? Not when I'm sober, even more when I'm drunk. \"Lyle was just giving me some reassurance, like a good friend he was. We weren't comfortable with the topic. Now shut up and let me watch.\" Stuart's POV Now. That felt stupid. For the whole night I had been drowning myself in my own sorrows, entirely convinced by the tight grip of Lyle and Mikaela's hands and their close friendship to boot, that they had decided to be a couple. From the lap dance, to the frantic search for a missing Mikaela (whom no one had thought was a bad idea for her to wander alone). Who knew what that fancy Alex would have done if I hadn't found her in time. Mikaela didn't managed to watch for long before all hell broke loose, my hands instinctively held hers as I dragged her with me to the exit of the club, behind the rest of our friends. It probably wasn't a good idea having Mikaela move so fast in her state, her face paled and she could hardly stand up after. \"Kae? You okay?\" My hand lifted my beanie from her head, putting it on myself before brushing off the loose strands of hair away from her face, watching her tiny hands held her head, the other reached over to one of hers and removed it from her face. \"I'm going to carry you, alright? Just go to sleep.\" With that, I managed to get her on a piggy back position, her eyes closed, head resting on my shoulder, her breaths in slow, steady rhythm. \"So… What about you and Mikaela?\" Nick's voice broke my gaze at the Golden Gate Bridge, after our small chat earlier. Mikaela was now resting on the ground, her head against the bench that Yoyo had refused to give up. \"Us? What about us?\" I didn't make eye contact with the older male; he would see the excitement in my eyes at the thought of an 'us'. \"Come on now, I thought we have just established a friendship here?\" His voice held an amused tone, making me chuckle along with him. \"I… I don't know. Really.\" I looked back to the sleeping girl, a small smile directed at her innocent profile. \"Let's see. You could only communicate with her without your eyes on the phone before today, you two instinctively get near each other for every meeting and you both got jealous at each other tonight. And you don't know ? You are smarter than that, man.\" At Nick words, I could only watch, hoping he would continue. Because he seemed to know what he was saying for once, and I have no clue… For once. \"Look, just ask her out. You like her, and I can tell she does too. Who did you think was the cause of her current state?\" Ducking my head down to hide the smile, a soft punch on my arm by Nick before he returned to Billy's side, while I returned to Mikaela. \"Kae? You awake?\" A soft humming acknowledged my question before I scooted nearer to her, laying her head on my shoulder while I stroked her hair. \"Can I ask you something?\" Another hum. \"Can I ask yo- No, I mean, may I… Wait, no, that's not right either. Sorry Give me a second.\" My eyes closed momentarily, before taking a deep breath. My head dipped down further into her hair before softly whispering. \"Would you like to go out on a date with me sometime?\" There wasn't a reaction this time. No humming sound, nothing. I briefly wondered if she had fallen back asleep, before she shifted in my arms, her head tilting up to look at me. \"Your heart was racing when you asked that.\" That was the first thing she said, great. Now my face is heating up while she chuckled at my reaction. \"Graham got a date with me by winning a challenge, although cheating.\" She started, her eyes searching mine for any signs of backing out before continuing. \"I would love to… if we win the app challenge. And if you would continue being my human pillow. Remind me to torture Yoyo when he sobers.\" At the outburst of discussion of an app idea though, the brunette stirred in my arms, forehead creasing at the disturbance. My hand reached out to her ear, pressing her closer to me so I could block her other ear from the noise. It all came naturally as my head dipped down once again, my lips kissing the top of her head before soothing her back to rest. Right now, this truly feels like the best day of my life.

Let me know what you think? 1 Blagging: Grabbing another player's broom tail to hinder them.[Chapter 6] Author's Note: ** STORY MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** I do not own any of the characters apart from my OC, Mikaela Kaitlyn Marshall. Information provided (about Google, etc.) may not be accurate, please do not regard them more than just a detail in the story. :) Thank you! Stuart's POV She had no recollection. Nothing. Nada. No memory of what happened before she concussed on my shoulders. SHE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME ASKING HER OUT. SERIOUSLY, OF ALL THINGS. \"Nothing?! At all?! What was your last memory?!\" \"My God, will you shut up, Twombly?\" And now we are on last name basis. Someone hold me. \"Answer. The. Question.\" \"You getting a lap dance.\" ... Great. In this case, she had missed out on pretty much EVERYTHING. I let out a groan as my head hung off the couch, laying on my back as Mikaela sat on the floor with hers on the same couch. It would have been cute and I would have smiled at how it resembled her innocent profile back at Golden Gate Bridge, if not for her lack of memory at our 'moment'. Ugh, I think my head is hurting more than my hangover now. \"Seriously, woman. Of all things, you chose not to bring your brain out last night.\" The blurt had inevitably hit a nerve in the brunette, and bundled with her hungover state, let's just say her temper got even shorter than it normally was. \"Well, excuse me for drinking out of je-\" As she snapped her head towards mine, our head aligning in an almost horizontal version of the infamous Spider-Man kiss, she bit her tongue in time. \"Out of jealousy?\" I teased as her face flushed, before turning into anger. \"You wished I was jealous, Twombly.\" Her words came almost in a hiss, and as my eyes met hers, the look in her eyes had brought me back to the club... Before all was cleared and while she was still in a furious rage. This isn't going well for me at the moment. My mouth opened to retort that she had, in fact, pretty much admitted to the jealousy, when Mr. Chetty strolled in. Instead of responding, I sat straight up from my position, my hand adjusting Mikaela's head so she didn't give away with the look on her face that we broke the Noogler rule. Although, Yoyo wasn't doing much to keep it under wraps too. \"... Wait, what? We won? We won!\" My feet sprung up from the spot. We won, which means I won a date! ... Oh wait . \"Kaela. You really, really don't remember anything? At all? Even the slightest?\" My index finger made contact with her forehead as I prodded some more, sliding down to the ground beside her after Mr Chetty was gone. That man had given me dirty looks once when Kaela and I got close; I was still figuring out if it was because of the programme rules, or his overprotective nature over the girl in question. \"I swear I don't.\" Her eyes were closed but I could tell from the tone of her voice that she had meant it. She didn't remember. My hand reached for my beanie before pulling it out, fingers running through my hair before letting out a defeated sigh. \"Oh no. Dark and stormy Stuart is NOT coming back.\" The voice of Nick had me raising my brows, his head lightly jerking towards Mikaela before looking at me again. \"It's something we call drunk teleportation. Yes, everything was forgotten and most probably permanently. But... You just have to try again. You got your answer yesterday, right?\" I knew what he meant by answer. It wasn't just the fact that Mikaela had agreed to go out with me, it was the fact that she was jealous. That she had even had that emotion, towards me in the first place. \"Ms Marshall? Your appointment with Mr Fischer is c-\" \"OH MY GOD. My appointment with Mr Fischer, I had completely forgotten about it. Oh God oh God.\" The sudden outburst from the brown eyed girl had everyone snapping up at her, her frantic movements around the room trying to gather what she supposedly needed and failing. My feet instinctively stood up to help her, but the receptionist who had walked into the room spoke before I could take a step. Her expression had turned from calm, to shock at Mikaela's actions, back to being collected again. \"Ms Marshall, MS MARSHALL!\" Mikaela dropped her files at the voice, her head spinning around with widened eyes like a girl caught red handed. \"It's eerily coincidental, but Mr Fischer had called in to say he thought you wouldn't be able to attend it today. He asked for you to rearrange and give him a call. Here's his name card and some... Gifts that he had me help to get.\" By now, confusion had overwritten Mikaela's previous emotion, so had it for mine. Her hands stretched out to receive the items before muttering a soft gratitude while the receptionist nodded in acknowledgement before returning to her post. Mikaela returned to the couch we shared, hands now holding onto a hot cup of black coffee, a name card, and... Wait, is that aspirin? Out of curiosity, my head peeked over her shoulder for a better look at the card while she downed the aspirin and took a sip of the coffee. Alexander L. Fischer ... Alexander? And that number looks oddly familiar... Alexander... \"Omg Alex?!\" My eyes darted to Mikaela's, trying to see if it had sparked any signs of recognition. Nothing. \"You know him? I haven't even met him.\" Uh, Earth to Mikaela, yes you had. But it was eerily coincidental. How they met in a club, how he happened to know it was her though the two have never met? My hand reached to take the card, the others had taken Yoyo to rest and clearing the room for my sake. \"This guy, hit on you last night while you were dead drunk.\" My hand flicked the card around, and there it was. A message written, taken by the receptionist if I had to take a guess. 'I didn't get a text, so I'm guessing your friend got a hold of my number instead.' \"My... Friend?\" I merely nodded at her question, eyes burning holes in the card. \"That's me if you were wondering. Also, you had pretty much admitted to being jealous last night.\" \"... Oh.\" It was her only reply, her hands snatched the name card off mine and her feet had taken a quick escape from the room. ... What just happened? Mikaela's POV I am swearing off alcohol. The lack of memory from the night before had done more than its part in bugging the world out of me, and the new information provided by Stuart had almost equated to my confession of love to him or something along the lines. My head. Ugh. The sense of betrayal, the image of him in the club was still fresh in my mind, but what had happened right after, I don't remember. Sure I remember getting drinks at the counter alone, dancing with strangers, but they were all in snippets; never in full details. And then there was Mr Fischer. I could see from Stuart's expression that he felt it weird too. How did that guy knew who I was and my face in the first place? Not unless he did some research of his own, I'm guessing. But most of my thoughts channeled back to another person. Stuart Twombly. It wasn't possible that I liked him. Infatuation, maybe? Wait no, that's pretty much admitting to liking him too. He had seemed so desperate for me to remember last night too. Oh my goodness, nothing happened right? Like... No. I woke up fully clothed in my room. Nothing could have happened. Lyle wouldn't allow it, I'm sure. So then, what- \"Keep your eyes on where you're going, or you are going to hit the pillar.\" A sudden hand covered my forehead from behind just as a pillar appeared in millimetre's distance from my face. The English laced accent though, I knew very well. Though, I don't think we shared the same amusement he apparently held at my current state. Especially not with my head pounding like that. \"Thanks.\" The terse reply of mine was followed by the plucking of his hand off my head, sidestepping, and proceeding back on my original route. But the guy was relentless. \"I do believe you owe me something. Something like a number on a calendar? Like, I don't know, a date?\" The last word had him blocking my path, his back arching down a little and his face donned a playful grin rather than his usual smirk. \"Ugh, leave it, Graham. I'm not in the mood for games now.\" And I wasn't. My hand reached to the sides of my head before rubbing them in circles. My other brought the coffee to my lips, desperately hoping the effects of aspirin would kick in soon. \"Hey... Hey, are you alright? You look a little paler than usual.\" The tone was surprisingly gentle, his hand plucked mine out of my face before both of his hands combed my hair back from each side, tilting my head so my eyes would meet his. The look of concern in his eyes as it darted between mine, weighing out how bad the state of my health was, was almost... convincing. To be honest, I was stunned by the gesture, it was sweet and unlike the usual arrogant genius reputation he held. \"Have you been resting? You should drink plain water instead of coffee to sooth the headache. You might be dehydrated.\" Yup, this was definitely not the Graham I was used to seeing around. Once snapped out of my state of trance though, I have a small smile, mouth preparing to spill a nicer conversation than before before his eyes caught something behind me. His expression hardening and back to its usual look. With my head turning back, his hands slowly released me, standing back to his tallest again. \"I guess I will see you around then.\" The sentence was said in a soft whisper, before footsteps going away from the other pair sounded. My eyes locked with Stuart in a stare off of who was more confused about what had just happened. \"Before you ask, or come up with a snarky comment, I have no idea what just happened either.\" Somehow, I had a feeling that he was jealous and another strange feeling of dejavu. Like, he had been jealous before, of me in close contact with another, and if I don't find a way to somehow explain myself, he would be winding up in another lap dance, or me in another case of being ignored. All I got though, was nervousness as Stuart approached me, his face still reflecting the same as it did seconds ago. His hand grabbed mine before dragging me to the nearest unoccupied meeting room with a swift 'We need to talk.' Those four words were as nerve-wrecking as it could get, topped with the enclosed area and closed off curtains. My eyes kept its contact and fingers playing with the coffee cup as I sat on one of the couches, legs lifted up with knees to my chest. Somehow it had felt like that day, years ago, in another meeting room at Google when I was caught for hacking. \"What did he want?\" It was the first question since the space beside me sunk with the weight of Stuart. His voice held a tinge of protectiveness and... Possessiveness? At least, it sounded like that. \"Uh. He was checking if I was alright. Told me to drink water than this coffee... For my headache.\" A voice in me told me it wasn't a good time for witty remarks. My eyes looked up timidly at Stuart before poking him on his side to get his attention, while his eyes were fixated on the floor. His reaction? \"Ah! D-don't do that. It, uh, it hurts.\" He had leapt out of his seat, before settling down again. My eyes now lit in amusement, the effects if aspirin had finally kicked in and my cup of coffee found its place on a nearby coffee table. \"Is little Stewy ticklish?\" My fingers now taunted as it swirled around, drawing imaginary circles inches away from his sides again and watched as he wiggled in discomfort, trying his best to stay on his spot. \"At least try not to look like you're having fun with this?\" He hissed, but not for long. I had launched attack on him as his involuntary laughter echoed through the room, hands trying to get a hold of mine. He never managed to do the latter but seeing as he was probably going to faint from lack of oxygen, I stopped. My face flushed red from laughter of my own, chuckles sounding with pauses in between. In a swift motion, my head was suddenly caught under Stuart's arms, stuck in a headlock. My arms flailed and I tried to wrestle... Or wiggle, my way out of it. \"Awww is little Kaela stuck?\" With my head under his horizontally, resting against his chest, I stared daggers to the side. \"Let go of me or I will tickle you!\" \"Ooohhh. Scary. I'm going to have to prevent that now.\" And with that his other hand grabbed both of mine and I had to resort to kicking around furiously with Stuart laughing at my misery. For a while I just laid there, exhausted all my energy during the struggle. My eyelids felt heavy despite the coffee, and the arms around me slowly retracted its presence. A kiss to the top of my head, an arm around my shoulders and fingers stroking my hair, playing with strands of it while it did. My head snapped up to meet Stuart's astonished gaze. \"I thought you were asleep!\" \"I was falling asleep. But not the point. That felt familiar.\" \"Of course it did, I did that just last night and asked you out but you forgot all about it along with Alex .\" His eyes rolled at the name of Alex before meeting mine. \"You asked me out?\" \"... Yea. You agreed too, if we won the app challenge.\" And suddenly everything pieced together, his exasperation for me to recall what happened, him sneaking a kiss to the side of my head this morning, and then another just now as I was falling asleep. \"I... I'm sorry. I really didn't remember any of it. But... A promise is a promise.\" I spoke almost hesitantly, my head tilting down to catch Stuart's who had resumed his relationship with the floor. Not his phone, surprisingly. The grin on his face though, was... too adorable for words. \"You know what? Actually, you promised me a kiss too. But seeing as you can't remember, I will let you get away with one on the cheek instead.\" His head tilted to his left, a childish smile on his face as his body turned to face me. I could only blink, several times, swearing to myself over and over in my head that I was never going to go near alcohol again. Words refused to form, and I cursed myself for saying 'a promise is a promise'. Everything happened a tad too fast. One moment, I was leaning in, tilting my head towards his cheek, and mind you I wasn't doing that in slow-mo either. But the next, he had turned his head towards me mere milliseconds before my lips were due to make contact with the cheek. ... And that was how we kissed, for the first time. Although really, it was more like a peck. But... Still... \"STUART TWOMBLY, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.\" The look of horror must had been obvious, because the element of surprise was still locked on Stuart's features. He seemed to have a hard time processing what just happened. My fingers flicked his forehead playfully, then wiggling back and forth at him. \"Chetty is going to murder you if he finds out. He behaves more like a father than my actual father. You're dead.\" \"... I regret nothing.\" His lips twitched up to a full grin seconds later, regaining from his shock. \"But before I die, let's go out tomorrow. We have three days break from challenges. Let's go out... On a date?\" THE NEXT DAY (still Mikaela's POV) Okay, firstly, I forgot how I ended up agreeing on the date which was happening... In about 10 minutes. But I did, and was strangely excited about it. Through the meetings that day, I was in a better mood than normal. Although lunch with Mr Chetty was like walking on a field of land mines. I could've swore he knew about our plans with the questions he had been directing at me. His fatherly nature never fails to make its presence whenever I was in question. I haven't been on a date since... A long time. I had called Marie for advice on what to wear, what to do, while keeping Stuart's identity a secret. While Lyle had trouble speaking to Marie, I was great friends with her after the continual dance sessions I attended. I couldn't ask Dana for advice because knowing her, she would question to the letter about my activities for the night. \"You sure this isn't too casual?\" \"Yes, Kaela, it's perfect. He did tell you to dress casual right?\" A soft hum escaped me, while I checked myself again in the mirror. My natural waves were brushed through and neater than normal. A long sleeved, navy knitted top paired with a simple black skater skirt, topping off with my favourite flat leather ankle boots. ... Gosh I'm such a girl. The soft thumping at the door had me frantically hanging up the call with Marie, my hand reaching for my satchel before pulling the door open. \"Graham? What are you doing here?\" \"I... I... Sorry, I just... Why are you all dressed up?\" Graham being caught off guard and all nervous must had been a first. \"Uh, I'm heading out for the night. With the intern programme having a short break and all.\" Avoid the number of people, avoid leaking the identity. His eyes darted to my outfit before smiling at me again. \"You look amazing.\" A soft blush crept up to my face before darting down to check my outfit over again. \"I was going to ask you out, but I guess that would have to wait. Let me walk you out.\" I was on the brink of rejecting his idea, but my mind reminded that it would be suspicious when I was obviously all ready to set off. Graham being nice to me shouldn't be surprising at all, seeing as how I was apparently a worthy ally in his eyes. But it did. Somehow it felt different from when we first met. The conversation from my room to the entrance of the Headquarters was surprisingly enjoyable. We talked about all things random, from the amazing playground that was Google, to the food we liked. When my eyes spotted Sid and Stuart, beside Sid's car though, I was stumped. What do I do now? Do I walk over and play it off as a friendly outing? Or pretend that I wasn't going out with Stuart? With the wave of Sid's hand, I knew it was too late. Graham's analytic mind had already geared into action when I turned to him. \"That's my call. I will see you around?\" He stayed silent for a few moments, observing, before giving a small nod of acknowledgement. He went into the building while I slightly ran towards the pair, into the embrace of Sid. \"Have fun, don't smash my car. Keep your hands to yourself, Twombly. Kaela's like my little sister, so don't you dare.\" The Afro haired dude spilled warnings like it was part of a joke, laughing as he gave me another hug before sending us on our way. \"I can't believe you borrowed Sid's car.\" I muttered, though with full confidence the guy would never tell on us. \"He owed us one for the Quidditch match. And he said going on dates is good for you.\" I scoffed at the comment before nudging him on the shoulders, watching as the sun began to set. \"Don't push the driver, according to Sid, I'm not supposed to kill you. But anyway. Why was Graham with you?\" \"He, uh. He came to my room, wanting to ask me out. But I already had plans so he walked me out instead.\" I could feel Stuart took a sharp glance at me before returning his attention back onto the road. \"Hmmm interesting. Sid said you were popular, I never knew it could be true.\" My hand flew to my heart, feigning hurt, taking in a great amount of air while I did, before replying. \"With the amount of interns for every intake, and me being closest to their age, and them not being able to date each other, they really don't have a choice.\" I mused at the fact before looking over to Stuart. \"Where are we going anyway?\" A burger joint. I'm at, a burger joint, and they are serving me burgers made from Heaven. I had bounced a few on my seat while getting munching on them. Stuart chuckling while I did. Despite feeling bad about it, he had paid for the meal, insisting that if he didn't, this wouldn't constitute as a date. As our hands linked, walking across the parking lot, we had our usual bickers. Laughter resonated as I tried to pull myself away, only to be tugged back with a firm pull from him. My stumbling was stopped by his arms over my shoulders and mine around his waist. It was fun, to understate things. \"Oh drive thru movie? I have never been to one of these!\" \"I heard.\" \"Someone had been doing their research huh.\" The front seats of Sid's car had no obstruction, meaning, we could fit a third person if we wanted. Or in this case, Stuart's sliding and his arms pulling me to him were made even easier. We both laid lazily against each other, car parked near the middle of the drive thru theatre as The Avengers started rolling. Naturally, for the two geeks, it called for geek talk. Things like who was in the original Avengers, who we were hoping to see, favourite superhero, and the list goes on. \"Are you sure you liking Loki had nothing to do with the actor?\" Pulling me away slightly to catch my eye, earning one of my playful shrugs in return. \"Well... He is Tom Hiddleston.\" As the movie went on, light chuckles were silenced by the sudden presence of his lips on mine, my hands, with minds of its own, linked themselves around the back of his neck as lips interlocked. It went like a broken record on repeat, kissing, to chuckles when we separated, into light pecks, and back to kissing again. The road back was almost sad, even though we would still be in the premise. \"That was... Fun.\" My lips curled into a smile as I spoke while the car was parked back to its original spot. My fingers played with those that were intertwined with mine at the moment. \"It was. And so would it the next time.\" My eyebrows quirked at his words, amused at his new found confidence before pulling away my hand and out the door, leaving him with a simple \"We'll see\" He had walked me back to my Google dorm room, admitting to his paranoia of Graham appearing again. His body leaned against the wall while I fiddled with my keys, finding the right one before opening the door and turning to him. \"Alright, I'm back to my room! Go rest now, I will see you tomorrow?\" Instead of an answer, the brown haired boy pushed himself off the wall and leaned nearer for a kiss, only for our moment to be interrupted by a familiar Australian accent. My hand tugged him into the room and behind the door before hiding behind the half open door myself. \"H-hey Dana. What are you doing up this late?\" With Stuart hidden, he took a hold of my right hand, playing with my fingers before planting a soft kiss to the back of my hand. Clearly entertained by my fluster. \"I heard you. Why are you back so late? And your face is flushed red... Did you go out for a drink?\" \"Uh, yea. Don't tell Mr Chetty?\" \"... Of course not, that man will give me a lecture on not keeping a keen eye on you. Oh well, better rest early, goodnight!\" \"Goodnight, Dana.\" The door closed instantaneously with my back against it and my hand pulled out of his grasp. \"Okay, you got to go.\" \"Or I can just stay here for the night.\" \"In your dreams, Twombly. Now goooo, before anyone else comes by.\" My hand reached his before pulling him out the room, the other landed on his shoulder while we were at the door way, tip toeing to give a peck on his lips. \"Thanks for tonight.\" Author's Note: I wrote this on my phone because my laptop is not due to be back until a while later. :( I will edit any mistakes when it's back and reply to all your reviews then!

I lost the entire story due to a crash and frankly, that dampens all motivation to rewrite it. I have been sick for the past week and just thought, oh well why not try. It's not what I first wrote it, and I've only come up with a chapter so far (nor is it long) but I hope it at least last you guys a while longer. I can't express how much love I feel from your reviews and thank you for waiting. I am trying to draft the next chapter, and I didn't want it to be sloppy, because GRAHAM HAS A HEART, GUYS. I do not own any of the characters apart from my OC, Mikaela Kaitlyn Marshall. Information provided (about Google, etc.) may not be accurate, please do not regard them more than just a detail in the story. :) Thank you! Stuart's POV 1 Text Message Received. [Open] [Close] Something exciting just happened! I found your girlfriend on this Face thing, and I added her! [Reply] [Close] [Delete] *Delete* Message deleted. … … … Wait. WHAT?! The drowsiness that had just mere seconds ago resided in me, flowing along with the blood that ran in my body, vanished as my brain began to work its gears. \"My mother had just added Mikaela on Facebook.\" … See, it sounds crazy – if not crazier – when I've put it into words, spilling the syllables out of my mouth and off my tongue. Although technically, she still wasn't my girlfriend. \"MIKAELA!\" My voice travelled across the lawn, my hair undoubtedly poking at all places as I busied my hands with tucking in my shirt – my legs carrying me towards the brunette who had been fully clad in her business attire, left hand balancing her Chrombook and a cup of coffee while her right cradled a bouquet of roses. … Hold it. \"H-hey.\" My eyes were focused on the roses as I managed to stutter out a greeting (really, it's pretty amazing considering I was stuck between the possibility of a rival, or the fact that I had just forgotten a really important date). \"Nice…\" Talk, Twombly, compliment her hair, her attire, her face, anythi– \"roses\" anything but THAT! I could almost feel the mental slap to myself before my eyes darted up to Mikaela's – she was either really amused or disgruntled – it was hard to tell when you've slept in till the afternoon, really. \"I mean, hair. Nice hair.\" \"Nice roses?\" She echoed, she eyebrows quirking up as she shift her weight from one leg to another. \"You're just the charmer, aren't you, Stuart?\" As she broke into a grin, an accidental sigh escaped my lips before my hands instinctively reached out to carry her Chromebook for her. \"Well, you can't blame me. I mean, I know how much you liked me and all, but roses? You really didn't have to go through that trouble getting for me.\" The smirk that tugged at the corner of my lip was quickly replaced with a pout as the said flowers made contact with the back of my head. I'm telling you – a bouquet of what looked like a hundred of roses doesn't feel good. Did they even remove the thorns? My eyes narrowed at the girl beside me – the girl who had focused her sight on the path ahead of us with a victorious smile, her head held high, the breeze ruffling her fringe as her long hair was tied back into a ponytail – the girl who was maddening and forgettable. Without a thought, or the fact that there were actual people walking around us, my head dipped down, lips brushing hers before pulling ever so slightly away. I could still feel her breath on my lips as I looked into her surprised gaze. \"That should wipe that smug smile off your face.\" The words that left me was in a soft whisper, and it took me all I could to not lean in for another. Not that I could, as the voice of Graham rung out behind us. \"I don't believe Chetty would be too glad about that.\" Was punching a fellow intern against the rule too? Mikaela's POV Everything was just a messed up, salad of weirdness for the past 2 weeks. The past week after Stuart and I had went on a date. Our only date, actually. I had been busy reviewing projects worthy in investing for Google, dealing with the intern program, and time was just not on my side. Though that hadn't stop the weirdness from happening – even if it did stop me from mentioning them to Stuart. The things on my plate had piled up to an extent whereby I had started avoiding having to address foreseeable problems with whatever I was or eventually would have said – which was weird, because well… it wasn't like we were together. The ghost of his lips that lingered on me took along my witty comments along with it, a slight smile was just appearing when the voice rung out. The voice I had so desperately avoided for the past week. The days since the incident. \"I…\" Brown orbs of mine avoided Graham's, and while my mouth moved slightly in attempts to find the words to fill them, I couldn't. \"I got to go.\" The words left in a murmur as I pushed my coffee cup into Stuart's hand, exchanging them for my Chromebook, before briskly walking (or really, a jog) past the pair and towards my room. I do not have time to deal with this right now. Graham's POV She was avoiding me. In complete honestly, it hadn't been like I wasn't expecting it – and it wasn't like I shouldn't already be prepared for it in that case – but it still stung. A deep intake of breath and a slight chew at the inside of my mouth later, my attention resumed to Stuart's glare. \"Your team leader was running like a headless chicken finding his team.\" I mustered the arrogance of my tone before turning my back towards him; take a few steps away before tilting back my head again. \"I would keep an eye out on the giver of the roses if I were you.\" With that, my feet continued its way to Mikaela's room, taking a detour to avoid Twombly's suspicions before my knuckles made contact with the wooden door. \"Mikaela?\" My voice was surprisingly and uncharacteristically soft, as my knuckles continued light knocks on the door. \"Please just… Just open up.\" The seconds of hesitation seemed like forever – especially when I know that if the voice that sounded had been Twombly's she wouldn't have contemplated in the first place. \"Mikaela.\" It was all I could say when her eyes finally met mine, before my memory decided to jog back to the night after her date with Twombly . [[ Flashback in Graham's POV ]] Thumbs danced around each other as my brows furrowed in confusion. It wasn't supposed to be like that; I wasn't supposed to feel this way. It was supposed to be a plan to get on her good side – whatever it would take; lust, love, crush – everything required to secure me a job at Google. But as Mikaela's face that morning, pale and vulnerable, flashing past my mind, I couldn't help feeling a feeling of… hurt? Anger? I'm not even sure. But it hadn't felt good – I wanted to be there for her, to just… Make her feel alright again. My sudden realization was enough for me to leap up from my bed, feet now pacing around my room. I can't, it's not possible. She was infuriating, never backing down from any threats. She hadn't even bothered masking her downright disgust with our bet on the date and me winning it – albeit through means. Sure, they were hardly the conventional justified way to win a match, but it got the result – that was all it mattered to me. Although, apparently the mere thought of her was enough for my feet to start acting on its own, heading towards the room of Mikaela before spotting Twombly and her peck. My body darted to hide in the shadows as the boy plastered with a stupid smile headed off. My hand curled into a fist before light knocks were heard on the door. \"Stuart, I told yo– oh.\" I hadn't know what was worse – the fact that she had been giggling as she opened the door, or the look of disappointment that momentarily flashed in her eyes before she masked it. Probably both. And without the ability to stop myself, I heard a soft voice – holding a tinge of hurt and helplessness – I heard my voice speak out to her. \"Am I too late?\" The simple words held double meaning – something Mikaela obviously understood with the widening of her eyes. [[ End Flashback ]] What was I going to do, seeing her again? I don't remember. All I remember was that I had walked away after the seconds of silence engulfing both of us that night, and rolling in the bed through the night. The sense of anguish at both myself and Twombly, and… Mikaela. \"You still owe me a date.\" I tried to pull it off as my usual self, even attempting my usual smirk, though even I could feel that it must had looked pathetic and desperate. \"A bet is a bet, Mikaela.\" And there was my voice again, filled with uncertainty and wrapped with a coat of anticipation. \"… Okay.\" Her word – two simple syllables – was enough to leave me breathless. My eyes widening like hers had, before slowly nodding my head, waiting for any continuation of her words before confirming that there were none. She agreed. ","Summary":" Author's Note: ** STORY MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** Now that that's out of the way… Hi! This is syllabl"},{"Movie":"Slumdog Millionaire","Title":"With Just One Blink of an Eye","Author":"LittleKenner","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4982027","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Slumdog Millionaire does not belong to me. It was such an amazing movie, I wondered what all Latika went through, so I made my own story of her trials and tribulations, and of course her love for Jamal. Hope you guys enjoy it! I ran through the narrow passages of our slum, crying hysterically. Why were these people doing this to us? What did we ever do to them? I couldn't wrap my mind around the fact that these men were doing these terrible things. I found a little corner, and stood there, watching in terror. \"Latika! Latika,\" I heard my mother cry. I looked down the alleyway and saw my mother, holding out her hand. I began walking towards her, and then stopped. \"Latika, come on! We don't have time for your games!\" I pointed behind her, trying to tell her about the man approaching with a mallet. Nothing came out, though. Not even the tiniest whimper. \"Mama,\" I cried out, pointing to the man behind her. I shut my eyes, and covered my ears, but I could still hear the whack of the mallet hitting her head. I screamed and opened my eyes, and I watched her body fall to the ground, blood pouring from her head. The man walked slowly towards me, with an evil look in his dark, cold brown eyes. I took off, looking for a safe place to hide. Screams filled the air of our normally peaceful slum. Houses were being set on fire, smoke began filling the air, and men chased after whomever they saw. Men, women, children. It didn't matter to these men. I found a tiny spot of my own, scared out of my wits. Two little boys passed by me, terror radiating from their bodies. The second one paused, and did a double take. I looked into his eyes, and felt something pull me towards him. Like, some imaginary string kept tugging at me to go his way. I took a step forward, and saw something light up in his warm brown eyes. \"Come with us,\" the younger yelled, waving his hand. I looked around nervously, scared to move. \"It's okay,\" he said, taking a step towards me. \"We'll make it out of here. I promise.\" I nodded and ran behind them, leaving the chaotic slum behind. I stopped when we reached the street, and looked back. Screams could still be heard, the sound of fire crackling filled the air. I looked down, tears in my eyes. How could this have happened? What had we done to deserve this? Why weren't the police doing anything? I felt a hand on my shoulder. \"It'll be ok. Don't worry,\" I heard the little boy whisper into my ear. \"Jamal-leave her! Come, let's go,\" what I assumed was his brother yelled. The little boy squeezed my shoulder gently, sending chills up my spine. \"Good-bye,\" he whispered into my ear before he turned, and joined his brother. I turned, and stared at the two figures, watching them walk away from me, just like everybody else. Silently, I trailed behind them, wanting to be accepted. My mother was all I had had left in this world and now that she was gone, I was all alone. My mind went crazy, thinking of how the three of us could be the three musketeers, and travel across India. We could have the most amazing adventures, and never loose anybody else. Maybe, even possibly, we could be a little family. BOOM! I looked up, cursing the rainy season. Oh great, I thought. A storm. Water poured down from the sky, drenching the two little boys and myself. The water stung my skin, as the wind made it colder. I watched in envy as the little boys found a covered place. \"Eh-go away!\" The older one cried over the storm. \"We don't want you here!\" I stood, hurt by his words. I kicked some pebbles, waiting to be allowed in. The rain pounded down harder, feeling like little bees stinging me over all over my body. \"Hey, come here!\" I heard a few minutes later. I looked up, surprised. \"Come on! Come here,\" the little boy called from the dry area. I ran over, appreciating his kindness. I sunk down against the wall, sleepiness finally washing over my body. My eyelids felt like they weighed a hundred pounds, and it drained the rest of my energy to keep them open. \"I'm Jamal,\" he whispered. \"What's your name?\" I looked at him, feeling something stir deep within my body. Something I had never felt before. It wasn't a bad feeling. Rather pleasant, actually. I shook my head, dismissing it. Feelings meant nothing to a slumdog. Your life depended on your cleverness and tricks. \"I'm Latika,\" I whispered back. I looked at the ground, feeling the same thing swirl within my stomach for the third time. \"Thank you,\" I said, a bit louder. \"No problem,\" I heard him whisper. I slowly lowered my upper body to the ground, and closed my eyes. \"Sweet dreams, Latika,\" I heard his faint whisper. \"Mama!\" I yelled. \"Mama! Mama! Mama! Come back, Mama,\" I yelled, watching the man hit her over and over again in my mind. Each time was worse than the last. More blood spilled out. The mallet became bigger. The man was scarier. I felt the man's eyes scan my body. I watched his black hair blow in the wind; watched him step over my mother's body, creeping towards me. \"Latika! Latika, wake up!\" I felt somebody shaking me. I opened my eyes to find Jamal standing over me, with a hand on my shoulder. \"It was just a dream. It was only a dream.\" I nodded, not wanting to argue. He moved his arm, about to move back. \"No,\" I whispered. \"Please stay.\" He nodded, sending some water flying from his jet-black hair. I smiled and moved over, making room for him. Jamal scooted behind me, and put his hand on my hand. \"I promise everything will be alright. I promise,' he whispered. He squeezed my hand, sending electric shocks through my hand, up my arm, through my chest, and finally into my stomach, fueling that feeling again. I smiled, liking this sensation. I could get used to this, I thought. I like how my hand fit into his. Like they were puzzle pieces, and they were meant to fit together like that. \"Does this promise last for forever,\" I questioned him, just wanting to talk to him. \"Of course it does. My promises last a lifetime.\" With that, I fell asleep, no dreams of my mother, or that man. No, my dreams were of Jamal. My dreams showed us together, forever, living in a house, with a family. Two little boys and a little girl. Most importantly, though, we were happy.[Chapter 2] \"Jamal. Jamal,\" I whispered the next morning, shaking the little one gently. \"It's time to wake up,\" I said a bit louder. \"Here, let me do it,\" his brother said, pushing me aside. \"JAMAL! WAKE UP!\" The elder shoved his brother, pushing him on his back. \"It's time to go,\" he said when he saw Jamal open his eyes. The littlest one sat up, and rubbed his eyes. \"Where are we going?\" \"Somewhere we can find food, hopefully. I'm starving,\" I said, rubbing my belly. Jamal's brother looked at me. \"What are you doing here,\" he asked with distaste. He guided his eyes over my body, examining to see if I was a threat, or if I would slow them down. \"I thought I told you not to come with us.\" I nodded. \"I promise I won't be a snail, and I won't attract trouble. I could be your watch guard, if need be,\" I begged, wanting t be part of a family. Even if it was a family of scattered people, who were thrust together through hardship. It was better than nothing. The boy nodded. \"Fine. You can stay. Come on, Jamal.\" He grabbed his brother's hand and pulled out into the sunlight. You would never have guessed that it rained just last night. Jamal let go of his brother's hand, and walked with me. \"That's Salim. He thinks he's the king of the world,\" he whispered, bumping his arm into mine. I giggled loudly, and covered my mouth. \"Eh-what are you laughing about?\" Salim yelled over his shoulder, never detouring from his mission. \"Where are we going,\" Jamal asked again. \"We're going to the market. Maybe we can get some food.\" He turned and faced us. We walked for a long time, wandering into the market. Women took pity on us, and gave us an orange, or a small banana. The farmers pushed us away from their carts, yelling about how we would infect their food, and make people sick if they ate it. Little children talked to us, and treated us like family. Eventually we left, seeking shelter for the night. We left, stomachs half empty, hearts half full. Salim walked ahead, searching for a place to sleep. Jamal and I followed him, not really caring where we went. It was already late afternoon, and night was quickly approching. \"Come on, slow pokes! We still have to find a place to sleep!\" Jamal and I looked at each other, shook our heads, and took off running. My white camisole flew in the wind as I raced Jamal. \"Hey-wait up!\" Salim screamed as we passed him. We giggled and ran faster. None of us knew where we were going, we just ran, Running kind of made it easier. It made me forget that I didn't have a mother, or a home. I was just racing a friend, just like in the slum. Panting, I stopped, unable to run anymore. \"Hey! Jamal! Salim! Where are we?\" The brothers stopped running and turned to look at me. I pointed to the unfamiliar houses. \"Where are we?\" My question hung in the air, like a bad fart that nobody wanted to address. We stood motionless, trying to catch our breath. I looked around. The houses were high, built of brick and concrete. There were tall fences, built of wood, and they had lines across the lawn, draped with clothes. \"Hey!\" We turned and saw a cop. \"What are you doing here?\" I turned and ran to the brothers. \"Let's go!\" I ran as fast as my legs could take me. I couldn't get captured. Not when I finally belonged to a family. My feet pounded into the ground, sending dirt flying. Breathing hard, I looked around for Jamal. \"JAMAL!\" I screamed, fear pulsing through me. I stopped, not wanting to continue without him. Suddenly, he was right there beside me, breathing hard. \"I found something for you,\" He giggled, holding up something yellow. He smiled warmly at me. \"I hope you like it.\" He took my hand and began running. Tingles shot up my arm, giving me that warm sensation again. I smiled, loving this feeling. \"Jamal! This way!\" His brother yelled from our left, who was hiding in an alcove, covered by a rug hanging on a wire. We turned, joining Salim into the tiny space. Jamal pushed me inside, shoving me up against Salim. Salim looked down at me, a wicked grin on his face. I felt my face get hot, and I looked down. I grabbed Jamal's hand, seeking comfort. \"Shh,\" he whispered, brushing his lips against my ear. \"Don't make a sound.\" I nodded, and moved closer to Salim, trying to give Jamal more room from the edge of the little indention. Salim rested his head on mine. I felt uneasy being so close to Salim. He didn't seem as innocent or kind as Jamal. My stomach churned as the seconds passed like hours. We stood motionless, waiting for the cop to pass us. My heart pounded as we heard him stop, just outside our little alcove. \"Damn kids,\" he said, slightly out of breath. We heard him turn around, and walk over to the entrance of the lawn. I stood motionless for several more minutes, making sure he was gone. Jamal took my hand in his, \"It's alright. He's gone.\" I pushed off of Salim, and followed Jamal out of the little fort. I looked around; making sure the guard was gone. Sighing, I turned to Jamal. \"So what is it you have for me?\" I twirled around, adoring the yellow dress Jamal had grabbed. \"I love it,\" I gushed, giving him the biggest hug I could muster. \"It's so pretty. Thank you so much!\" Jamal shrugged like it was nothing. \"It was just hanging there, and I thought you would like it, so…\" He trailed off, staring at me. I giggled and looked down. Looking into his eyes made me shiver. Not in a bad way, but it made me feel something that couldn't be described in a way that made sense. I moved my foot, making odd shapes in the dirt. I glanced up, and caught Jamal's warm brown eyes. He flashed his smile at me, making my heart pound. I smiled back, lost in my little fantasy world of us being a family. \"Hey-come on! The sun's almost down,\" Salim said rather roughly. \"Where are we going to sleep?\" The three of us looked around. We were still behind the tall brick houses, munching on thrown away food. \"What about the hiding place?\" I offered. The brothers looked at me. \"It's so small, though,\" Salim commented, obviously not enjoying my idea. \"We could fit, though,\" Jamal stated. \"We're small enough that only a bit of the last person would be showing.\" I looked at him and smiled. Thank you, I mouthed. Jamal nodded. Salim sighed, giving up on his argument. \"Fine. Whatever.\" Salim turned and entered the nook. \"I'm going to bed,\" He called from behind the rug. \"You were right. He does think of himself as a king,\" I told Jamal with a smile. Jamal laughed and put an arm around me. \"You what I think?\" \"Hm,\" I questioned, unable to say more due to our intimate distance. \"I think Salim believes that he decides our fate.\" I giggled. \"Our destiny was written by the gods, not by a silly little boy,\" I told Jamal, and leaned into him. Silence took over as we watched the light depart. The cricket's chirps filled the air around us, almost drawing us closer to each other. I yawned, and patted Jamal's leg. \"I'm going to bed,\" I whispered, sleepiness draining my voice. \"I'll go with you,\" Jamal said just as softly. He took my hand and led me to the tiny space. \"Ladies first,\" he said, allowing me entrance. I smiled at him and lay beside Salim. I patted the space beside me, and smiled up at Jamal. The youngest of the bunch smiled back and lowered himself to the ground. He nudged his head against mine. \"Goodnight, Latika,\" He whispered, looking me in the eye. I smiled at him, feeling that rush again. \"Goodnight.\"[Chapter 3] I awoke the next morning to find Salim gone, and Jamal watching me. \"Salim's gone to find breakfast,\" Jamal said, petting my hair. \"You're really peaceful when you sleep, did you know that?\" I shook my head, trying to rid myself of the last drops of sleep away from me. Sunlight filtered through between the walls of the houses and the rug, giving our little fort an eerie feel. I sat up suddenly, remembering my dream. It was really rather peaceful. \"What?\" Jamal questioned, looking at me with his curious brown eyes. I shook my head. \"Just remembering my dream.\" The little boy nodded. \"What was it about?\" I felt heat rush to my face again, embarrassed to tell him. \"You can tell me,\" he whispered, placing his hand on mine. I nodded, feeling the comfort his touch always gave me. \"Well, we were all older. You, Salim, and me; we all were much older. We traveled around the world, getting famous, and getting lots and lots of money. We all lived in a big, fancy house, and lived well. It was so normal, and we loved it. It was a lovely dream, really,\" I lied. My dream had really been about the two of us, living together, having a family. I shivered, a nasty habit I had whenever I lied. \"That does sound like the good life,\" Jamal commented. \"The three of us, going off together on adventures. You and me, always together. I could buy you new dresses everyday. I could spoil you, and buy you anything you wanted. Would you like that?\" Jamal's eyes lit up at his own fantasy. He wiggled his eyebrows at me, \"Wouldn't you love it if I spoiled you?\" I giggled. \"Yes I would. You would lose all your money, since you would spend it on me, though. Wouldn't you save some for yourself?\" I looked at him out of the corner of my eye. \"Wouldn't you want to spend some on yourself?\" Jamal stood. \"If it was for you, my princess, I would spend all the money of the world on you! I would buy you every sari you loved, every dress you adored, every piece of jewelry you wanted! I would buy you everything you desired.\" He stuck out his hand for me to take. \"Then we would get dressed up, and I would show you off to the world and say, 'this is Latika! She is the most beautiful girl in the world! Look at her beauty!' And all the men would be jealous, and envy us,\" he concluded his own story of us. \"Would you like for that to happen, Latika?\" Jamal placed his hand on mine, and pulled me closer. \"We could make it happen,\" he breathed into my ear. I held his hand tightly. \"I would love for that to happen,\" I whispered into his tiny ear. Then, ever so gently, Jamal kissed my cheek. My cheeks burned, worse than ever before. I pulled away and looked into his deep brown eyes. Quickly, I kissed his cheek in return. \"Here. Eat some food,\" Salim ordered from the doorway. I turned, startled. How long had he been standing there? The three of us ate in silence, not wanting to discuss the morning's events. I took tiny bites of my apples, attempting to savor it. I glanced over at Jamal, who had his eyes locked on me. He smiled a bit, almost unnoticeable. His brown eyes shimmered, even in the pale morning light. I smiled back at him, feeling the warmth spread all over my body. Salim coughed, breaking the spell between Jamal and me. I looked over at the eldest. Salim stood, finished with his breakfast. \"Come on, let's go find a real place to live.\" I looked up at Salim, not ready to go. \"Stand up, Latika,\" He ordered, and grabbed my arm. \"I said we are leaving,\" he pulled me up roughly, squeezing my arm tightly. I pulled my arm from his grasp. We stood there, glaring at each other, waiting for the other to break. \"Come on, let's go, Salim.\" Jamal said, tugging his brother's arm. \"Let it go,\" he whispered. Salim blinked, and nodded. \"Come on, Latika. We are going to find a place to live and sleep and eat.\" I nodded and followed behind the brothers. They talked fast, in low voices. Salim looked over his shoulder, and looked at me. I cocked my head to the side, trying to figure out what they were talking about. Suddenly, Salim raised his voice, \"Jamal-don't. It's not worth it.\" Quickly, Salim lowered his voice again. We wandered through Bombay, searching for a new home. Then we found it. A dumpsite. It was perfect for us. We could recycle almost everything there, and it was a short distance from the dumpsite to the market, so we could go and beg for food and money. This place was perfect for us. Quickly, I ran and grabbed Jamal's hand. \"Come on, let's go,\" I giggled, and pulled him along. Jamal laughed and ran with me. \"Come on, Salim! Don't be a sour puss,\" He laughed over his shoulder. Jamal squeezed my hand and helped me up the large pile of debris. I looked down and groaned. \"What,\" Jamal asked, panicked. I shook me head and pointed to my dress. \"I got something on it,\" I complained. Jamal laughed and swung an arm around me. \"Oh, this is why we keep you, just for laughs.\" I glared playfully at him and pushed him slightly. \"Thanks, that means a lot to me,\" I said sarcastically. \"Hey, some help would be nice,\" Salim called from the side of the pile. I looked down and giggled. I nudged Jamal and pointed to Salim. \"He looks like monkey, no?\" Jamal looked down and laughed. He grabbed my arm, trying not to fall from his laughter. I held his arm, laughing just as hard. Salim glared up at us, not finding it the least bit funny. \"Come on, help me get up!\" He yelled. Jamal laughed even harder. \"All right, all right. I'll help you up,\" he said between fits of giggles. Jamal reached down, and grabbed his brother's hand. Grunting, he pulled Salim up. They sat there for a second, looking at the slum a few kilometers off. \"All right, Let's go find our house,\" Salim said, hoisting himself up from the piled debris. \"Come on.\" Salim stood, his hand outstretched. I took it, and pulled myself up. Salim smiled at me, attempting to look innocent. I smiled back, sensing something beneath his child eyes. The three of us walked around, searching for something to build a makeshift house with. Together, we found two sticks, a piece of string, tattered cloth, and a tire wheel. Salim built a little tent for us, while Jamal and I went to the market to get food. Jamal and I walked the narrow alleyways of the farmer's market, hand in hand. \"What should we get,\" I asked, leading him to a small booth. \"Mmmm, can we get some mangos, or apples, or bananas,\" he replied softly, not wanting to be heard. I nodded, only enough for him to see. The stall had piles of apples, mangos, papayas, and oranges. Jamal talked to the farmer, distracting him. Quickly, I grabbed two apples and a mango, and began walking off. I headed over to the entrance of the market, not wanting to get stopped. Jamal ran up, a smile on his face. \"Can I have the mango?\" I laughed at him. I shook my head, but handed him the mango. He smiled and hugged me tightly. \"Thank you!\" I laughed and continued walking towards the dumpsite. Jamal munched on the mango happily, not saying anything. \"I have a question,\" I said softly, glancing at Jamal. \"Ask away, my dear,\" he giggled, placing his arm around my neck. \"Why is Salim like that? Why is he mean to me?\" Jamal was silent for a few minutes, thinking of how to answer me. Finally, he spoke softly, \"Well, I think when we saw our mother die, something died within him. The kindness left the moment we saw her fall down.\" I gave him a one-armed hug. \"I'm sorry,\" I whispered. I hugged him a bit tighter. \"But, he's not that bad, right?\" Jamal looked at me and kissed my cheek once more. \"This is why I keep you around, to be the sun in my world, and make everything seem brighter, even in the darkest days.\" He kissed my cheek once more, and took an apple from me. \"Let me help you up,\" He whispered, and took the other apple as well. That night we slept well, our stomachs almost full for the first time in days. I slept peacefully, dreaming of a world where Jamal and I lived together, spending our money on each other, and showing our love off to the world. Dreamland was so much better than reality.[Chapter 4] A/N: Thanks for all the feedback! Thank you for all the comments, constructive criticism, and everything else! I hope you guys enjoy! And yes, I know the name for Maman's place is really stupid but it needed a name, so that's what we got! We lived there for a few weeks, recycling whatever we found. Many other children lived there, too, surviving the same way we did. Salim led us through the city, guiding the kids to the different farmer's markets in the area. None of us dared to go to the same market two days in a row. The days slowly grew longer, hotter, harder. Farmers began remembering our faces, limiting our food sources. The sun pounded down, burning our skin. Arguments arose of stupid things, like whose turn it was to stay up and watch for police. The three of us stayed together, though. Something bound us together, keeping any of us from leaving the other two. I sat up in our little tent, unable to fall asleep. Jamal slept to my right, totally out. Quietly, I crawled out of the opening. I squinted against the harsh sunlight, searching for Salim. The sun beat down, warming my already burned skin. \"Salim,\" I called, looking around. Finally, I spotted him a few meters away, picking through some papers and bags. The boy looked up, startled. He shook his head with a faint smile, and continued his search. I walked over to him, and sat to his left. \"Want some help,\" I asked, digging through the papers. \"Thanks,\" He said, shuffling through the mess in front of us. We worked silently, just wanting to make it through the day. \"Does today feel different to you,\" I questioned, looking at him through the corner of my eye. Ever since I had woken up that morning, something seemed different. The air was filled with a different energy; something was going to happen. Salim shook his head. \"Not really,\" He yawned, stretching his arms up. \"Do you want me to take over? You can go get some sleep,\" I said to him, not feeling the least bit tired. Salim shook his head and suppressed a second yawn. \"Come, go to sleep,\" I said whilst tugging his arm. \"You're sleepy. I can go through this. Whenever you wake up, you can come back.\" \"But, it's your turn to sleep,\" Salim argued. I shook my head quickly. \"I can't, though. So, just go. I don't mind.\" I smiled at him and waved over to the tent. \"Go. It's fine.\" Salim stood and looked back at me. \"Are you sure?\" I gave him a slight push towards the tent. \"Just go,\" I smiled, and returned to my work. The sun beat down on my back, making me feel like I was on fire. I worked silently, letting my mind wander from topic to topic. I thought of my mother, how her hair would look on a day like this. It would have been a lovely, glossy black. Her bangs would have fallen from the bun she always wore. A smile would have been on her full pink lips. She would have worn a bubbly blue sari, perhaps, or a bright green one. I smiled slightly, remembering how she always seemed so beautiful, and striking when she had her hair up, and her favorite sari on. My smile broadened as I remembered how my mother always held a smile on her pink lips, no matter how difficult the day had been. I stood, done with the all the papers around me. Grunting, I grabbed the massive white bag, full of papers and various bags we had found. I snapped my head to the right, hearing the low rumble of an engine. A yellow van pulled up to the dumpsite. Faded red letters adorned the sides, saying 'Maman's Home for Displaced Children'. A smile broke out on my lips. Maybe they were here to help; maybe they were here to take us to a family that could take care of us! I let go of the bag and yelled at the top of my lungs, \"Jamal!\" As quickly as I could, I ran over to the tent. I watched the van, making sure it wasn't a trick. Two men emerged from the van. One of them carried a white sack, which looked to be like it was holding something heavy. The two men walked over to our tent. The one with the bag bent down, and put one hand inside our small, little house. I ran faster, wanting to see what the man was up to. Breathing hard, I finally stopped behind the tent. I bent down, and peeked into the small hut. Jamal and Salim turned, smiles on their faces, and bottles in their hands. \"Latika,\" Jamal smiled, and handed me the bottle. \"Try this. It's good.\" I looked at the bottle, then Jamal, and finally rested my eyes on the man. His smile was warm and comforting. \"Hello, little girl. Take a sip. It will cool you off.\" The man's voice sent chills running through me. I looked at both Jamal and Salim, anxious about this man. Salim nodded, \"It's really good.\" Slowly, I stretched my arm forward and took the glass bottle. It felt amazingly cold against my sun burnt hands. I looked once more at my other musketeers, still not trusting the man. The brothers nodded, smiling at me. Slowly, I put the glass bottle to my lips and tilted it upward. The brown liquid was sweet, and so cold! Instantly, I took another, long, deep swallow of the brown drink. I stopped and handed the bottle back to Jamal. \"Thank you,\" I smiled to him. Jamal shook his head. \"Thank him. He is the one who brought them to us.\" Jamal nodded his head to the man from the van. He smiled from behind his sunglasses. \"Hello.\" The man waved, then pointed to the van. \"Do you want to live in a place where you can have those drinks all the time?\" The three of us nodded all at once, desiring more. He laughed, and whispered something to the man behind him. \"If you would follow Punnoose, he will show you to the van, where we will take you to the home.\" I stared at Punnoose, who had squatted to reach our level. He smiled, trying to look trustworthy. The man with sunglasses turned to face Punnoose, and stood. I nudged Jamal; liking the fact the men's eyes weren't studying our every move. \"Do you trust him,\" I whispered into his ear. Jamal nodded,but didn't turn around. He kept his eyes locked on the big yellow van between the men's legs. \"Salim, do you trust them?\" The elder turned and nodded his head, flopping his dark hair around. \"Come on, Latika, imagine what else he will give us if he gave us these drinks before he even took us to the home!\" I sighed and nodded my head. \"All right. If the two of you trust him, I'll go.\" The man with the sunglasses bent down again. \"Are you ready to go?\" Salim nodded. \"We're ready.\" He stood up and grabbed Jamal's arm, helping him up. I stood behind them, watching the man silently. The brothers left the tent, and began walking over to the van. \"Are you coming too, little girl?\" I stared at the mysterious man hidden behind his sunglasses. I nodded my head. \"Yes.\"[Chapter 5] The man held out his large, brown hand. \"I'll walk with you,\" he smiled, still hiding behind his dark sunglasses. I looked at his hand, not wanting to take it. \"I can walk by myself, thanks,\" I said, and stormed through the tiny hut. He followed behind, watching me closely. His steps came closer, louder. I stopped walking, waiting for him to reach me. \"Yes, princess?\" he asked, squatting beside me. I cringed; hating the little name he gave me. \"Do you have any more of those drinks,\" I asked softly, refusing to look at him. I stared at my bare feet. Dust covered them, making them look white. I felt his hand on my shoulder. It wasn't comforting like Jamal's. His was heavy, forced. Like he was pretending to care. The man forced a laugh. \"Of course I do, princess. Come with me.\" He stood and held out his hand once more. \"I'll bring you to them.\" I stood there for a minute before taking his hand cautiously. We walked towards the van in silence. I smiled when I saw Jamal waving from the large, semi-tinted windows. He held up a bottle, full of the yummy brown liquid, and the thumbs up sign with his free hand. I laughed, unable to stop it. The man let me in the van first, and told me to wait at the front. He pulled out a bottle, and opened it for me. \"Here you go, princess,\" He smiled, handing me the bottle. \"Can you not call me that,\" I questioned, looking at the bottle. \"Of course. What's your name, then, little girl?\" He stared at me, and slowly took off his sunglasses. His eyes were a dark, dark brown. I gasped, startled. \"I'm Latika,\" I told him. I took a small sip from the bottle, trying not to look into his dark eyes. He smiled at me, and held out his hand. \"It's nice to meet you, Latika. I'm Maman.\" I gave him my free hand, and nodded. \"Now, go join your friends. I think they want to talk to you.\" Maman pointed to Jamal and Salim. I smiled faintly at him, turned, and then hurriedly walked through the aisle of the van. Jamal patted the seat beside him, and smiled. \"Can you believe our luck? Imagine, if he gives us all of this before we even get to the home, what would he give us once we're there!\" I forced a smile on my face. I wasn't going to be a downer on his mood. \"Yeah! Can you imagine all the food he must have?\" I laughed and took a drink from the bottle. Salim and Jamal blabbered on about food and games and clothes and more food. I canceled them out, trying to get the creepiness from Maman's eyes out of my mind. Closing my eyes, I tried to remember my mother. I tried to think of her smile, her sari, and her hair, even her smell. I tried to think of anything of hers that would wash this eeriness from my mind.I looked at her, and stared into her big, chocolate brown eyes. Her eyes were just as soft as the last time I saw them. She smiled her lovely smile, the one I saw everyday. Her hair hung down, framing her face, unusual, but it looked lovely on her. Her sari was a bright yellow, making her skin glow. I knew it was my mother, but it didn't seem like it was. The details were too perfect, almost like it was a doll of my mother, that acted like my mother. She opened her mouth, and began talking to me. Her soft voice flowed through my head, telling me not to worry, that everything would work out in the end. I told her about how Maman's eyes scared me, and how much I missed her and how I felt that things wouldn't work out without her with was on my side, she told me. I sighed, and crawled onto her lap once more. I leaned into her, and felt same with her arms around me, telling me stories of princesses and love and fate. A smile found it's way to my lips again, as I remembered a time when everything was all right. A time when my mother was there with me. \"Is everybody ready,\" Punnoose yelled, snapping me back to reality. The bus was full of kids, all laughing and talking. The sun was beginning to set, giving the bus a campfire glow. Kids screamed back telling him to hurry up. Salim was bouncing around, talking to anyone who would listen. Jamal had fallen asleep, and was snoring softly. I rubbed my eyes, finding most of the kids from the dumpsite were here. \"Latika!\" I turned, trying to find who had called for me. Arvind stood in the aisle, swaying with the motion of the van. I smiled and gave him a hug. \"How are you?\" He shrugged his shoulders, and sat behind me. I turned to face my friend. \"Are you excited?\" He asked, bouncing on his seat. \"I am. I mean, when he was talking to me, he said that he had mounds of rice, mangos, and apples waiting for us! He said that he has enough food to feed all of us until we're 60! Can you believe that?\" Arvind slowed his bouncing, trying to catch his breath. \"I mean, we will never go hungry,\" He continued, smiling at me. I smiled brightly. \"That much food? Seriously? Goodness, we will eat so much that our tummies will hurt for days!\" I giggled and ruffled his hair. \"What kind of food do you hope he has waiting for us?\" The little boy stood and leaned over the seat, trying to be heard over all the screams and fits of laughter. \"I hope he has everything! I want Kima Mutter, or Dalchini Palau.\" I licked my lips, thinking of my mother's Dalchini Palau. She had the best Dalchini Palau in the slum. \"Mmmm,\" I said into his ear, trying to be heard over all the noise. \"That sounds so good. I hope he gives us naan and Baigan bhurta. Anything they have though should be good. I mean, if what you said he said was true, then they must have everything! Anything they cook must be good!\" Arvind giggled, and patted my hair. \"He says he has warm water, and soap and beds for all of us! We won't have to sleep on the ground anymore! I wonder how good it will be to not sleep on the ground.\" He sighed, and sat back down, weariness setting in. Arvind rested his head against the back of my seat, and closed his eyes. \"So what were you dreaming about?\" His voice floated from behind the seat. I peeked over the back of the chair. \"What do you mean?\" Arvind looked at me, and shook his head. \"When you were asleep, you looked so peaceful and happy. It was like the world was going for you. From the smile you had on your face, it looked like fate was finally going to go good for one of us,\" he said, waving his hand around at the kids. I smiled and looked down. \"I was just thinking of my mother,\" I confided in him. \"She was telling me that everything was going to be all right and that destiny was on my side. I really don't know what to think. It sounded like her, it looked like her, but I'm not sure if it was her.\" Arvind smiled. \"Do you think one of the gods came and told you a piece of your future? That would be amazing. I wish that would happen to me. Sometimes I think that all of the gods are against me, and trying to make my life terrible.\" He sighed and rubbed my head once more. \"But if the gods are smiling on you, I will be happy.\" I smiled back at the small boy. \"I think that the gods will smile on you. I want to be happy with somebody that's happy, too. Maybe once we get there, the gods will see how wonderful you really are, and tell you of your future.\" I rubbed his thick, black hair. \"Besides, I don't really think the gods are smiling down at me. I think they are laughing, enjoying this misfortune.\" Arvind smiled and rubbed my hand. \"When you realize how much the gods are smiling down at you, you will tilt your head back and say, 'Arvind was right this whole time!' \" I laughed and playfully hit his shoulder. \"Shut up.\" ","Summary":" A/N: Slumdog Millionaire does not belong to me.

Enjoy! Chapter One: From: Stuart At 9:30am Are you here yet? I'm bored out of my freaking mind. Maya smiled at her phone before grabbing her bag and sliding out of her car. She typed her reply as she walked towards the building, locking the car behind her with the click of a button. To: Stuart At 9:30am Just got here. Did you save me a seat? From: Stuart At 9:31am Obviously. Now hurry up. To: Stuart At 9:32am Kiss my ass, Twombly. From: Stuart At 9:33am I'd rather kiss something else... ;) Maya giggled when she read that text, looking up at the building as she got closer to the front doors. The walls were made of glass, and the word Google was in large font across the side of it. She glanced around and noticed some fancy fountains, cars designed to drive themselves, high tech bikes, picnic tables and a volleyball court in the giant courtyard. She lifted up her phone and took a picture of herself in front of the building. She was wearing a black tank top tucked into maroon high waisted skater skirt, a nude cardigan that went down to the middle of her thighs, and a pair nude ankle boots with a small heel. Her dirty blonde hair was down to the middle of her back in loose curls which were blown back slightly from the wind. She had on a lightning bolt necklace that stopped just above the waistline of her pants, and a bunch of bracelets on her right wrist. She quickly sent the picture to Stuart then posted it on Instagram and Facebook before going inside. To: Stuart At 9:34am In your dreams. From: Stuart At 9:34am Every. Single. Night. To: Stuart At 9:35am You're horrible. Maya immediately noticed the temperature inside was refreshingly cool after being in the California heat. They must have really powerful air conditioners to keep such a large place cool. She slid her cell phone into her pocket and adjusted her cardigan, looking around. The place looked even bigger on the inside. There was a freaking slide in the middle of the room, which Maya set a mental reminder to go on at some point over the summer. Even the chairs looked like fun. They were half spheres that you could practically crawl inside of. Maya let out an amazed noise before heading towards the check in station and getting her badge which she clipped onto the waistline of her skirt. They gave her a snapback hat with the google colors on it that said 'Noogler' across the front, and had a mini propeller on the top. She shrugged before pulling it over her head It didn't match her outfit at all, but oh well. It was mandatory so people could tell the difference between the workers and interns. She thanked the woman at the desk and made her way to the food court she had noticed. She ended up in line behind a really tall man. While she waited Maya pulled out her phone and checked her notifications. Her mother commented how proud she was on Facebook, along with a bunch of her friends from school and gym. Her instagram received a ton of likes, and a few comments about how pretty she looked. She replied with a blushing emoji, and was about to read Stuart's reply, but looked up in surprise when the man in front of her ordered a whole bunch of crap. She stared at him in shock. He had two coffees, two bananas, a bag of bagels, four bags of chips, and three pudding cups. Maya gave him a polite smile before stepping up to the counter. \"Can I get a bottle of Gatorade, a orange juice, and two bags of chips?\" She requested. The man smiled and said 'sure' before grabbing her things. From: Stuart At 9:35am You know you love it. To: Stuart At 9:42am I absolutely do. ;D She thanked the man. \"How much?\" \"It's all free.\" He told her. Maya raised her eyebrows in surprise before grabbing a green apple and grinning at him. The man smiled at her and told her it was fine. She thanked him again before dropping the apple and bottle into her bag and heading towards the hall where the seminar would take place. It took her a minute to spot Stuart in the crowd of interns, but she finally spotted a familiar guy with glasses staring down at his phone and wearing a Noogler hat. She made her way though the people on the bleachers and slid into the open space next to him. \"Hey, this seat taken?\" Maya asked teasingly, making Stuart look up from his phone. \"Finally. What, did you you stop to get you nails done first?\" Stuart joked as he pulled her in for a sideways hug. \"To grab snacks, actually. And guess who's not getting his?\" Maya said haughtily. She pulled her chips out and opened the bag. She had only eaten one chip when Stuart snatched the bag from her. \"That's fine. I'll just eat yours.\" Stuart said, popping a few chips in his mouth. Maya rolled her eyes and tossed him his gatorade before she started eating her own chips. Before she could reply, an Indian man started speaking through a microphone at the center of the room. \"My name is Roger Chetty, and I am head of the Google intern program. Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship, oh no. You will do what we do, and we will watch how well you do it. Now you represent the finest schools, your intelligence, your achievement is well noted. But to excel at this internship you're going to need far more than brain power. What you're going to need is Googliness.\" Everyone laughed. \"Nothing funny. Googliness. The intangible stuff that made a search engine into an engine for change. Now, you'll be divided into teams. By the end of the summer, only one team will be guaranteed a full time position. The other 95% of you will not. Now you have been split up into seminars to acquaint you with our campus and seminar descriptions have been emailed to each of you.\" Maya pulled out her smartphone to check her emails and noticed Stuart doing the same. \"I would wish you luck, but it's not luck that you need. Get to work.\" Chetty finished speaking and people began leaving the hall. Maya finished her bag of chips and crumpled up the bag so she could throw it out in the next trash can she saw. Her and Stuart walked together to their first seminar which was in a different building on the campus. When they went in the were greeted by a woman at the door who handed them each two plastic paddles, a red and green one. They shared a look and found some seats next to each other. \"Are we playing some stupid game or something?\"Maya took off her hat and shook out her hair while Stuart traded his hat for his usual beanie. \"Who the hell knows?\"They both took out their phones while they waited for the seminar to start. Ten minutes later Chetty showed up. \"Now I recognize Google is not a conventional workplace.\" Chetty began. \"Having said that, we have rules. I'm going to ask you a series of questions. You're going to raise the green paddle to indicate yes and the red paddle to indicate no.\" To: Stuart At 12:05 pm What are we, five? Maya heard him snicker a few seconds later, then her phone vibrated. From: Stuart At 12:06pm When are they gonna have us sing our ABC's? After nap time, or story time? \"So, let's begin.\" Chetty clicked a button on the remote in his hand, and the computer screen at the front of the room changed to show a question. \"Having a beer with your boss.\" Everyone held up their red paddle. Or at least, almost everyone. \"Some of you are under 21.\" Chetty pointed out. Stuart nudged Maya with his elbow and smirked at her. She stuck her tongue out. Everyone lowered their paddles. \"Some of us aren't under 21 so if you want to grab a cold one with me, I'd be happy to do that with you.\" Someone responded. Maya glanced behind her to see the man with short, curly dark hair, from the food court earlier, along with a blonde man. They were both much older than all of the other interns. Her and Stuart shared an annoyed look. \"I will not be grabbing a cold one with you.\" Chetty shut him down. \"You get high?\" The man asked. Maya looked over at Stuart and he had the same incredulous look on his face before they both shook their heads and faced forwards, not wanting to get in trouble. \"I do not get high,\" Chetty replied. \"I'm not judging. I'm just saying, some people do it.\" The man must have leaned forward because Maya suddenly heard his voice whispering from right between her and Stuart. \"That being said, if you want something cold to drink we'll hook you up.\" \"Okay, thank you. Just stop talking to us.\" Stuart replied, not bothering to look at him. \"I'm your Bill Holden in Stalag 17.\" The man said anyway. \"I really don't get that reference.\" Stuart said, still facing the front. \"Google it.\" The man replied. \"Got it.\" Stuart said, done with the conversation. Maya bit her lip to keep from laughing before reading a new text. From: Stuart At 12:08pm I'm about to hit this guy with these paddles. What the hell was he talking about? To: Stuart At 12:08pm Stalag 17 is a thriller/drama that came out in 1953. The main character was William Holden. From: Stuart At 12:09pm How do you even know that? To: Stuart At 12:10pm I googled it. ;D \"Dating a fellow intern.\" Chetty read out loud. Maya peeked over at Stuart through her curls, quickly looking forward and holding up a red paddle. She didn't notice him looking over at her before doing the same. \"This is Google, not .\" Chetty clicked another button and an animated red paddle with the word 'NO' on it popped up on the screen. Maya supposed people got that wrong sometimes for them to have that at the ready. \"Chetty, excuse me. What about a full time employee? Say management level, but not a direct supervisor, great eyes, and a severity to her that is surprisingly sexy. What's the policy on that?\" The other man, the blonde one, disrupted the seminar this time. Maya bit her lip and looked down, trying not to laugh. She let her hair cover her face so Chetty wouldn't notice. From: Stuart At 12:11pm You think these idiots are funny? \"No? That's frowned upon also?\" The blonde continued when he saw Chetty just staring at him. \"So we'll say no to love?\" The first guy asked. \"We say no to love. Yes.\" Chetty affirmed with a sarcastic smile. The blonde held up the red paddle instead, mumbling something under his breath. To: Stuart At 12:12pm They're like overgrown children who won't stop bugging the teacher. Chetty looks all kinds of fed up with them. Lol XD From: Stuart At 12:12pm So easily amused. :P \"Now,\" Chetty said, making the screen change again. Maya looked back up.\"Taking food home from the office.\" She held up a red paddle but heard the guy behind her say 'boom'. She shook her head. \"Are you having difficulty with this, Mr. McMahon?\" Chetty asked, smiling though he was clearly annoyed. \"Just to drill down on this, what if there's like, a perishable? Say there was, like, a pudding or something that was left out.\" The man said. From: Stuart At 12:13pm How did these morons even get in? \"You'd like to take home pudding, would you?\" Chetty asked politely, though he was no longer smiling. \"I wouldn't mind taking home a pudding. I- I don't know what- But, that being said,\" Stuart let his head drop to his chest in annoyance. \"If it's gonna go bad, is it okay to take it home?\" \"Mhm. Anything else you'd like to take home?\" Chetty asked. \"Well, I- let's say salsa and chips. something that's not wrapped.\" The man replied. \"Salsa, chips, and pudding.\" Chetty listed off. \"Or sushi.\" The man supplied. \"Salsa, chips, pudding, and sushi.\" Chetty reiterated. \"Anything else?\" \"Ice cream?\" The man said. \"Salsa, chips, pudding, sushi, and ice cream.\" Chetty said. \"Pizza.\" The man said. \"Salsa, chips, pudding, sushi, ice cream, and pizza.\" Chetty listed. \"I wouldn't take home a frozen pizza. But if there was a nice pie that was out...\" The man said, his friend chuckling at him. Maya rolled her eyes. To: Stuart At 12:15pm He just doesn't know when to shut his mouth. \"Oh boy.\" His friend whispered with a smile. \"I am truly impressed, Mr. McMahon.\" Chetty said, walking forward and resting one knee on the seat on a chair and his hands on the back of it so he could talk directly to him. Maya slid over to the side so she was out of the way. \"Well, thank you.\" The man replied. Maya shot a look at Stuart. Did this guy actually think that was a compliment? , she thought. \"At both of you. At how quickly you have confirmed my doubts about you. Now, let's try this one more time. Taking food home from the office.\" Chetty said, raising his voice slightly on the last few words. Everyone held up a red paddle again, this time Chetty joining in. \"Very good.\" He let the paddle fall out of his hand an onto the chair while giving the men a sarcastic glare. To: Stuart At 12:17pm BURNED! Go Chetty! Go Chetty! From: Stuart At 12:18pm Lol, you're ridiculous. Chetty went back to the front of the room. \"Ladies and gentlemen, that is all.\" Everyone began collecting their things and leaving the room. Maya pulled her bag over her shoulder and slipped her phone into her pocket before taking out her orange juice and taking a sip. She smiled at Stuart and the two of them walked out of the room together towards their next seminar. \"I love that guy's accent.\" She told him. Stuart raised his eyebrows at her. \"Chetty's?\" \"Yeah, it's adorable the way he rolls his 'r's.\" She explained. \"To be completely honest, I just really want him to say something like, 'This is Tech Support.\" Stuart said with a bad indian accent. Maya laughed at him. \"That was horrible. Were you trying to sound Indian or Jamaican?\" She teased him. Stuart rolled his eyes at her playfully. \"Let's see you do better.\" He goaded her. Maya just shook her head. \"Nah, I know my strengths. Fake accents is not one of them. It would probably sound Scottish, or British if I attempted it.\" \"Yet you're making fun of me. At least I tried.\" Stuart exclaimed. \"And failed.\" Maya filled in, chuckling when Stuart sent a mock glare her way.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: The next day started the same as the first. Maya drove to Google, grabbed something to eat, and went to sit in the hall where they would listen for their next instructions. When she got there she found Stuart sitting by the aisle with one leg lying across the seat next to him. Maya walked up to him. \"Hey.\" Stuart looked up from his phone at her and smiled before letting pulling his leg down and sliding over so she could sit. \"All yours. You look great, by the way.\" Stuart complimented her. Maya looked away for a second so she wouldn't blush. She wasn't sure why she got so easily flustered whenever he complimented her. She always took it in stride when her past boyfriends called her pretty, even before they were dating. And Stuart was just her friend. Maya looked down at her outfit. She was wearing a white dress with floral print that ended mid-thigh, a green army jacket that looked almost like a blazer with the sleeves rolled up, and a pair of open toed, peach color wedges that matched the color of some of the flowers on her dress. She only wore two bagless on her left wrist, and a simply tear drop diamond necklace that her father bought her. Her hair was down in loose curls again. \"Thanks. You're looking pretty good yourself.\" She told him, making Stuart roll his eyes. \"I'm serious.\" \"Yeah, sure. Anyways, I'm pretty sure they're separating us into teams today.\" Stuart changed the subject. Maya decided to just go along with it. \"Yeah, I figured. I overheard Chetty saying something about the first challenge being today, and those are group things, so…\" Maya shrugged before taking a sip of her orange juice. \"I just hope we don't get stuck with those two idiots from yesterday.\" Stuart said. \"Eh, they'd probably be entertaining.\" Maya said. \"That's just because you're easily entertained.\" Stuart said, chuckling when Maya shoved his arm. \"I am not!\" She protested. \"Maya you spent a good twenty minutes playing with the propeller on your Noogler hat yesterday, and you wouldn't stop giggling every time I made helicopter sounds. That's something that usually only appeals to infants.\" Stuart said bluntly. Maya rolled her eyes, but a guy started speaking over the microphone before she could reply. \"Welcome to day two!\" The guy called out and the crowd cheered a bit. \"My name's Sid, eight year Googler. You guys are new Googlers, thus you're Nooglers!\" \"Now it makes sense!\" Maya exclaimed while everyone else laughed at the man. \"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.\" Stuart commented on the title. Maya shrugged before pulling out her phone, Stuart copying her. \"Okay. Now, this place is all about community and collaboration. So you'll be working in teams from here on out.\" Chetty came up to the guy and yanked the microphone out of his hands. \"You have five minutes. Pick your teams.\" Maya simply moved to the side and sat on Stuart's lap without looking up from her phone. From: Stuart At 9:03am Are you claiming me right now? To: Stuart At 9:04am Obviously. I was just gonna put my feet in your lap, but I'm wearing a dress. \"CalTech. Nice. You're with me.\" Maya looked up from her phone to see a dark skinned guy with a british accent staring at her. \"Excuse me?\" She said. \"I said you're with me. Let's go.\" He demanded. Maya let out a mocking laugh. \"How about you go fuck yourself, curly.\" Maya snapped before going back to her phone. \"My name is Graham.\" He told her angrily. \"I really don't care.\" Maya said bluntly without looking up. To: Stuart At 9:05am What a dick. From: Stuart At 9:05am On the bright side I think you really wounded his ego by brushing him off in front of the little posse he's creating. To: Stuart At 9:06am Good. He would do well with taking it down a notch. Or ten. \"I was voted most likely to succeed out of my chess club.\" An asian guy was telling Stuart. Stuart looked at him for a second before going back to his phone. From: Stuart At 9:09am These people are ridiculous. To: Stuart At 9:10am Let's not be so quick to judge. Maybe they're just not good with first impressions. Some guy ran up the steps of the bleachers and began talking loudly to the two old guys from the other day. From what she heard, he was a team manager and he would be in charge of the leftovers, which included her and Stuart. From: Stuart At 9:13am If that guy keeps talking like that I'm gonna hit him. To: Stuart At 9:14am He sounds like such a white boy tryna be gangsta. Mauya jumped a bit and looked up when the guy yelled, \"Let's get a team meeting go everybody! Come on, team meet time! Wonder twin powers activate!\" \"You have got to be kidding me.\" Maya said, staring at the guy in shock as he walked off. Her and Stuart shared a look before she moved off of him and grabbed her bag before they followed the wannabe gangster to his office. Maya sat on the end so she was resting the side of her body on the cushiony back of the couch and her legs were stretched across the seats, crossed at her ankles. Stuart plopped down by her feet while another girl sat by the computers across the room, the two old guys sat on stools, and the asian guy from before was seated in a normal chair. \"Alright,\" Their team manager said. \"Let's get some Meet and Greet goin' up in this hizzy. I'm Lyle, and it's pretty much WYSIWYG- What you see is what you get. Been here at the Goog for four years. Working on seven prgies in esto momento.\" \"Wow, seven projects.\" The blonde man said, sounding impressed. \"Hey, they ask I do's it. What can I say, I'm a people pleaser. Especially the ladies, my mercedes!\" He said towards the other girl. From: Stuart At 9:34am Is he trying to flirt? To: Stuart At 9:34am God, I hope not. That was pathetic. \"So it's all good in Lyle's hood, ya heard?\" Lyle continued. \"Uh, yeah. Is Lyle always gonna be referring to himself in the third person? Because if he is I might wanna punch Lyle in the face.\" Stuart said, making Maya snort before kicking his thigh. \"Play nice.\" She reprimanded him. Stuart sighed before going back to his phone, sending her a meme. \"Okay, tough but fair. Good note. Lyle's still a little nervous. Uh, first time manager. Lyle's a first time ma- I'm gonna stop doing it. I'll cut it out. Keep it to first and second person. Who's next?\" He called out, taking a seat. The Asian guy stood up. \"My name is Yo-Yo Santos.\" \"Yo-Yo, how about a high five?\" The dark haired man said, raising his hand. Yo-Yo flinched away, making everyone look at him. \"Whoa! Easy, buddy. I come in peace.\" \"Jeez, Yo-Yo, did you get beat up a lot in school?\" The blonde one asked. \"I was home-schooled by my mom.\" Yo-Yo answered. \"Did you get beat up a lot at home-school?\" The dark haired guy asked. Maya resisted the urge to throw her heel at him for asking such a personal question. \"Discipline is a very important part of growth. But my mother was actually very nurturing. For example she selflessly provided me the milk of her bosom until I was seven years old.\" Yo-Yo said. Maya slowly looked up from her game of Temple Run to stare at him. \"So it's like, uh, you're tying your shoes, you're climbing trees, you're blowing up fireworks, and you're right on mom. You got mouth on mom.\" The guy said, making a hand gesture as if her was holding a breast. \"Breast feeding leads to a higher IQ.\" Yo-Yo confirmed, not bothered by our reactions. \"Okay.\" The guy said, looking ready to change the subject. But his friend decided to comment. \"Actually the science isn't quite definitive on that.\" Maya quickly searched on Google and didn't even have to look at Stuart to notice he was doing the same thing. \"I was bottle fed and it never slowed me down. Vitamins are vitamins whether they come from a teat or a baba.\" \"Wrong.\" Maya and Stuart said. \"Sorry, what was that?\" The blonde asked as they all turned to look at them. \"Wrong. The teat or baba thing, it's wrong.\" Maya answered. \"We just googled it, so you're wrong.\" Stuart finished for her. Everyone continued to stare at them. \"Oh, yeah. I'm Stuart.\" \"Maya.\" She told them, not bothering to look up from her phone as she looked at the website. Lyle waved at them. \"Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Stewie, M-Dogg. but you can't trust everything you read on the-\" The blonde started. \"The Journal of the American Medical Association?\" Stuart cut him off. \"Sounds pretty trustworthy.\" \"It says that breast milk more nutrients and that those nutrients are more easily digested and absorbed.\" Maya read out loud. \"Your confusion's understandable, though. You were bottle fed.\" From: Stuart At 9:48am And you told me to play nice. ;P \"They're right. That's right.\" Yo-Yo agreed. \"Oh, guys, where;s all of this hostility coming from?\" The dark haired guy asked. \"Where do you think it's coming from, you big tree?\" Stuart snapped. This time Maya didn't say anything. As entertaining as she found those guys, she was severely annoyed that these two were on her team. Her chances of getting a job were slim to none with those two there. \"Two fifths of our team are made up two old guys who don't know shit.\" \"Wow.\" The blonde one whispered. \"Okay, guys. I, for one, am very happy to have two strapping, mature gentleman on our team.\" The girl said, standing up. Maya raised an eyebrow, sharing a look with Stuart. \"Thank you.\" The blonde said. \"Oh, uh, I'm Neha Patel, and oh my god you guys would make the best Luke and Han.\" Maya searched google images for those characters and compared them. Yeah, she could sort of see it. A little bit. If she squinted. \"Excuse me?\" The blonde said, confused. \"Oh, Star Wars cosplay.\" Neha explained. \"Cosplay?\" He repeated, still lost. \"Cosplay.\" Neha repeated. \"Costume play. You know, where people dress up as their favorite anime or movie character. I'd be slave girl Leia. Yeah. Metal bikini top, metal G-string panty, high heeled leather boots. Of course I'm chained at the neck. Not too constricted, but just enough to make things interesting.\" Neha spoke in a low voice. Everyone stared at her. \"The neck constriction is interesting?\" The dark haired guy repeated in shock. \"Yeah, a few of us get together and whatever happens, happens.\" She said. Blondie's eyes widened and his eyebrows shot up, his mouth forming a small 'o'. Maya stared at her. \"You need Jesus.\" Neha turned and glared at her while Stuart snorted and Lyle laughed before covering his mouth. \"Anyway,\" She said, turning back to the guys. \"Work-wise your 'skills' aren't really relevant here, or really in this millennium, so stay ou of our way. We're gonna do this shit on our own.\" From: Stuart At 9:56am Her 'skills' aren't relevant anywhere other than a street corner. Horny bitch. To: Stuart At 9:57am LMAO! Metal G-string? Seriously? She was trying way too hard. \"Well I'm loving this friction, you know why? 'Cause that's how you get a fire started.\" The blonde said. \"I'm Nick, this is my pal Billy, And despite what you may think of us, we're here just like the rest of you just running down the dream.\" \"Alright.\" Lyle said, clapping his hands together as he stood up. \"Team Lyle!\" They all stared at him. \"No, okay. We'll workshop that. It's in Beta. Okie Dokie. Let's go, out Translate Lecture is in fifteen minutes.\" Lyle announced. To: Stuart At 10:01am We are so screwed. From: Stuart At 10:02am Tell me about it.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three: \"Good morning, interns.\" Chetty's voice came from the speakers as all the computer monitors in their office went black before a small image of him speaking popped up on them. \"Today marks the first of several challenges through which your team will show their merits. While internally dog-fooding a new product a number of Googlers reported a bug that disabled their audio. All two million lines of that code have been included in the source files. Your job? Find the bug.\" The screens went back to normal and the team immediately got to work. \"Okay we should check the user reports.\" Neha suggested. \"Scan the logs for any red flags.\" Yo-Yo added. \"See what exceptions were thrown.\" Stuart said. \"I always start by drawing up strategies to sift through the code.\" Maya said, grabbing a marker and writing on the glass. They all got to work while Nick and Billy watched. Code, right? Cods, right? Codes. So at the end of the day we're kind of looking to break the password here, right?\" Billy said. Everyone started getting distracted but continued writing. \"Maybe the answer's in the question. Maybe it's something with bug.\" \"Ureka.\" Nick called softly. Maya's hand paused as she lost track of what she was doing. She shook her head before writing again. \"Bug like fly. The fly. Is Chetty a cinephile?\" Billy said. \"Goldblum.\" Nick said. \"Goldblum!\" Billy yelled. \"Boggles my mind that no one has a notebook out.\" Nick said towards all of them. \"You guys are focused on writing this gibberish. Maybe that's helpful, maybe it's not, but I guarantee what we're saying is helpful!\" \"For the love of god, shut up!\" Maya snapped. \"We're looking for a bug, not a password. They are two completely different things.\" \"Keep going with that human connection. You had it.\" Nick said to Billy, ignoring Maya completely. She growled under her breath before trying to get back to work. \"Oh, you know what?\" Billy groaned. \"Stay positive. Stay positive. Go, go!\" Nick encouraged him. \"We're gonna go on fly, 'cause that's where we're at. Fly. We're flying it. Fly, fly. I like that. Buzzz… L Y F.\" Billy said, writing on the glass. \"We scramble the letters it's life! For some reason I can't get fly out of my mind. And now I'm going Loped. Jennifer Lopez. Is it a fly girl?\" \"Super fly!\" Nick called. Pop fly! Uh, excavation. Earthquake! California!\" \"That's it! Write that down! Do it, Do it, Do it down!\" Billy yelled. \"Will you please stop!\" Yo-Yo finally yelled. \"No, we're working!\" Nick said. \"No, we're working.\" Y-Yo corrected him. \"Yeah and that's a sharpie by the way, genius.\" Stuart pointed out, making Billy pause to look at the marker in his hand. \"That's my fault.\" Billy said, licking his fingers and trying to wipe it off. May shook her head in disbelief. \"Look, guys. I'm sorry, but you're not helping. You're saying a lot of words really fast that mean absolutely nothing.\" Neha told them. \"To find the bug we need to scan the user logs, review the code until we find the programmer's mistake. It's the only way.\" Maya explained, the others nodding in agreement. \"Except, what if it's not the only way?\" Billy objected. Maya groaned. \"Go.\" Nick whispered as he pointed at his friend. \"Okay, you said someone programmed it. That means some person in this building wrote that code.\" Billy said. \"A human being.\" Nick agreed. \"Let's give him a name and call him Tony.\" \"Tony.\" \"Let's say Tony like kayaking.\" Billy continued. Stuart gave them the most annoyed, disbelieving look he could manage. \"Kayaking.\" Nick repeated. \"All of the sudden, me and Nick become friends with Tony.\" Billy spoke, Yo-Yo giving him a look as if asking if he was serious. \"Me and Tony we're throwing a few beers back. Doing a little kayaking with my main man Tony. Tony's bombed on the open water, next thing you know we start gabbing about audio bugs!\" \"Yeah, I actually think that's a great idea.\" Stuart finally spoke making the team, sans Nick and Billy, stare at him in shock. \"Good, great.\" Billy exclaimed. \"Finally.\" Nick said. \"Dark and stormy, feeling us.\" Bill said. \"Yeah, no. Feeling you big time, buddy.\" Stuart agreed. \"Terrific.\" Billy said. \"You know what, in fact, why don't the two of you guys right now go and find the programmer.\" Stuart told them. Lyle shook his head when he realized what was going on, but the rest of the team had already gotten on board. \"Great. Great idea.\" Billy said. \"Yo-Yo, who's our man?\" Nick asked. \"His name is Charles Xavier.\" Yo-Yo said. Maya followed his line of sight to see the figurine of the character from the X-Men. Nick repeated the name while pointing at Yo-Yo. \"Perfect. Nick, write this down.\" Billy ordered. \"Steel trap!\" Nick waved him off, gesturing to his head. Neha quickly jumped in. \"Uh, he's a professor… at Stanford. Yeah, just a few minutes away, really.\" \"Guys.\" Lyle objected. \"And he's in a wheelchair.\" Stuart added. \"Got it. Stanford, wheelchair. What else.\" Billy said. \"Uh, he's bald.\" Maya offered. \"Might be with his best friend who wears a metal helmet.\" Stuart said. Maya bit back a laugh at that one. \"He's in a suit.\" Neha said. \"He has a British accent!\" Maya told them. \"British!\" Nick yelled, pointing at Maya. \"With my ear? We're done here.\" \"Okay, keep searching. Think fly, think bug. I promise you this somehow intercepts with Goldblum.\" Billy told them before following Nick out. \"Alright, back to work.\" Maya said as she turned around and started writing on the glass again. Ten minutes later they had moved from the writing boards to the computers. \"Yo to the Yo, where are we at with ensuring it wasn't a networking issue?\" Lyle asked Yo-Yo. \"Confirmed there was no packet loss. Almost done checking whether the encryption had the wrong certificate.\" Yo-Yo replied as he typed into the computer. \"I'm sorry, 'almost'?\" Neha cut in from across the room at a desktop computer. \"You're either done or you're not. You can't be almost pregnant.\" \"Yeah, hey she would know, guys.\" Stuart said, working on a laptop. Maya was sitting on the floor next to his computer chair working on another laptop. Today she was wearing a dark blue corset with pink floral designs on it, with a white cardigan thrown over it that had some light flower patterns on it. She had on high waisted jeans that were a midnight blue color, and a pair of pink heels. Her hair was clipped back half up half down. \"You know why don't you google 'asshole', Asshole.\" Neha snapped. \"She's right. it's not good enough. Get it together Yo-Yo.\" Yo-Yo berated himself, plucking out his left eyebrow hairs. \"What the fuck are you doing?\" Maya demanded. \"Punishing myself for my inferior performance.\" Yo-Yo answered as he plucked more hairs. \"Okay, how about you don't do that? If you want to be punished you can go on a time out later. Right now you need to focus.\" Maya told him. \"Well, that's good. We got crazy over here, and crazy horny over here.\" Stuart stated, gesturing at Yo-Yo then Neha. \"Oh, let me guess. Big dick 'cause little dick?\" Neha asked. \"Did your mind just immediately go to a penis joke? Is that like all you ever-\" \"Oh, I'm sorry. Was that not witty enough for you because I'm too busy working.\" Neha snapped. \"Actually you're too busy yapping your fucking mouth. You're not even facing your computer.\" Maya cut in without looking up from her screen. \"Mind you own business, tramp.\" Neha barked at her. \"Sorry, what was that, little miss slave girl in a metal G-string?\" Maya asked, still not looking up. \"If you're gonna be an obnoxious bitch, at least attempt to multitask so we can get this done.\" Another ten minutes filled with pointless arguing later, they finally called for a break and went to lunch. Neha was talking to Yo-Yo and Lyle on their side of the table while Stuart and Maya sat on the other side. To: Stuart At 12:37am The deadline's at the end of the week but we're not even going to finish by the end of the summer if she doesn't stop picking fights over stupid shit. \"Hey!\" Stuart said, drawing their attention to Nick and Billy as the men approached the table. \"Did you find professor Xavier?\" \"Yeah, we found him.\" Nick answered sullenly. \"Yeah, thanks so much for that. Really great team spirit.\" Billy told them. \"Mind sliding over here?\" Stuart, instead of making room for them, slid closer to the edge and spread his legs to take up as much room as he could. \"I'm sorry, it really doesn't look like there's enough room for you.\" Yo-Yo said. Maya rolled her eyes and leaned over to talk to Stuart. \"Knock it off.\" She whispered. Stuart ignored her and sent a wink at the two men. \"Have a great lunch.\" Nick said dejectedly. \"Yeah, enjoy it.\" Billy added before the two of them walked away. Maya felt guilt rising in her stomach and let out an annoyed sigh before kicking Stuart's leg under the table, making sure to get him with her heel. \"Gah, son of a bitch!\" Stuart hissed, glaring at her. Maya just glowered right back. He grabbed his phone and angrily typed out a text. He clearly didn't want to have this conversation in front of the rest of their 'team'. From: Stuart At 12:42pm What is your issue? To: Stuart At 12:43pm You're being a dick. You didn't need to do that to them. From: Stuart At 12:44 pm Since when are you on their side? To: Stuart At 12:44pm I'm not taking sides. I'm telling you that you're taking this too far. They may be complete idiots, but that doesn't mean you should treat them like shit. From: Stuart At 12:45pm And what do you call that little trip we sent them on to find a fictional character, hmm? A friendly joke? To: Stuart At 12:46pm No, I call it being a bunch of assholes. We were frustrated and they were being difficult. I know how important this is to us, but maybe it's important for them, too! Ignore them if you want, but please stop going out of your way to make them feel unwanted. From: Stuart At 12:46pm Why is this so important to you? You don't even know them. To: Stuart At 12:47 Because I know what it's like to be treated like dirt because you're different from everyone around you. Remember high school when we were picked on for being smarter than everyone else? I would never wish that on someone else. Please, just do this for me. His reply took a minute, but this time his typing was a lot calmer and he was more relaxed. From: Stuart At 12:49pm Fine, but I'm only doing this for you. And I'm not apologizing to them. Rather than replying Maya dropped her phone on the table and grabbed Stuart's face, planting a big kiss on his cheek. She didn't even notice the blush on his cheeks or the surprised looks the team was giving them, because she was distracted by an alert on her phone. She heard the others phones go off and groaned when she read it. \"That asshole Graham and his team won.\" She said when she read the email. \"On the bright side the next challenge is a Quidditch match. That can't be too bad, right?\" Neha said. \"Yes! I love Quidditch!\" Lyle cheered. The others just gave him funny look before going back to what they were doing. From: Stuart At 12:53pm At least we have you on our team. You're still into running, right? To: Stuart At 12:54pm Absolutely. And I've got good hand-eye coordination, I just don't really play team sports. BTW What the hell is a kwiditch? From: Stuart At 12:54pm Lol, It's Quidditch. A sport from the Harry Potter Series. To: Stuart At 12:55pm I've never read those books! D: From: Stuart At 12:56pm Come over tonight. We have the whole week to prepare. We'll watch movies and I'll explain it to you. We can catch up. Last week was the first time I've seen you in person in three years :( To: Stuart At 12:58pm I know, I know. I've missed you, too. Want me to give you a ride home? I'll need to stop by my place first, though. From: Stuart At 12:59pm Yeah that sounds good. Can't wait! To: Stuart At 12:59pm Me neither. ;) Stuart and Maya were steadily growing even closer ever since the internship began. They were used to being pen pals, sharing phone calls, and video chats on Skype ever since they went away to college. They were still close, but not like they were back in high school. But ever since they saw each other in person there has been this tension between them that they refuse to acknowledge. Not to mention the fact that Maya thought Stuart had gotten extremely hot in the past few years. And sometimes, by the way he looked at her, Maya thought he felt the same way about her. Not that either of them had said anything, but they had been flirting a lot the last few weeks. Maya was a highly intelligent girl who graduated high school her junior year with a 5.0 GPA. So on a subconscious level she was aware that she was developing romantic feelings for her best friend, and she thought he was in the same boat. But she refused to really admit it to herself. The last thing she wanted was to ruin her friendship with Stuart over a silly crush.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four: On Monday of the next week Maya was dressed in short black gym shorts with purple lining, a black sports bra, and a matching purple racing tank. Her wavy blonde hair was up in a tight high ponytail and she was wearing some black and white Nike sneakers. She caught Stuart staring at her toned tan legs for a good minute before he said hello to her, and she had to hide her grin. Her morning runs had done her body good, especially since she'd been doing it since her sophomore year of high school. Right now her and her team were all dressed for exercise, and were running onto Google's game field. There were spectators there to watch the game, many of them lined up on either side of the path they had to take onto the field, so that the team was running through them to get there while they cheered them on. Nick, Billy, and Lyle all tried to look cool while the rest of them just jogged over. \"Are you really wearing a beanie?\" Maya asked Stuart in disbelief. \"It's not a preference. It's a lifestyle.\" He told her jokingly, making her roll her eyes while fighting a grin. \"Why the hell do we have to run with brooms between our legs, though?\" \"The tech department hasn't figured out how to make them fly yet.\" Lyle cut in. She gave him a look asking if he was joking or not, but he had already turned away. They all ran to the middle of the field on their side of the line with Graham's team on the other side. The guy from last week, Sid, was playing referee. \"Alright, welcome to the Quidditch Pitch. Let's have good clean match, Nooglers!\" He blew the whistle and everyone moved further back on their side to get into position. \"Am I the only one who can't stop staring at Chetty in that cloak?\" She asked Stuart. \"At least he's getting into the spirit.\" He shrugged before looking at his phone. \"Maybe you should, too.\" Maya reprimanded him, gesturing to the device when he looked at her. He rolled his eyes before making a show of locking the screen and paying attention as the group huddled together. \"Okay, rules. The beaters toss the bludgers at the chasers before they can get the quaffle through the three rings. No blagging, no blatching, no blumping, no habersacking. I don't wanna see any quaffle hogging. No imperious curses, no confundus charms. In the unlikely event of a dementor attack use a patronous charm. I recommend the stag but that's a personal decision.\" Lyle told them. Maya stared at him with wide eyes before looking at Stuart who looked just as confused. He glanced at her mouthing 'habersacking?'. \"Lyle, Lyle, Lyle!\" Neha interrupted. \"These beautiful idiots have no clue what you're talking about. Come on, use your muggle words.\" \"Oh, I know that one!\" She whispered the Stuart excitedly. \"Come on, Lyle, you're making me feel like I'm back in math 've got a couple savants here with eye-hand coordination. Just say game on and let us play.\" Nick said. \"Fair enough. Version 2.0: Peg them with the kickballs before they throw the volleyball through the hoop. Brooms in, people.\" Stuart gave her an exasperated look but they both stuck their brooms in the small huddle. \"Hufflepuff on three. One, two, three!\" \"Hufflepuff!\" Everyone yelled. Stuart just mumbled it when Maya smacked his shoulder. \"Yeah son!Yeah, let's get it!\" Lyle yelled. \"Is he on drugs?\" Stuart asked her, staring after Lyle with an annoyed look. \"Honestly? It's a possibility.\" She answered. They all ran to the white line in front of the hoops on their side nd kneeled down on it, waiting for referee to blow the whistle. Maya felt like a complete idiot with a room sitting between her legs. \"No mercy! no mercy!\" Graham yelled at his team from across the field. Maya mocked his words. \"Tips down! Blue team ready?\" Sid yelled. \"Ready!\" Graham roared. \"Red team ready?\" \"Bangarang!\" Lyle yelled. What the hell? , Maya thought. \"Brooms up!\" Sid called. Everyone jumped into action, running for the balls. Maya tried not to look to awkward with a broom between her legs as she sprinted forward. The blue team reached the line first and grabbed the three balls. almost immediately earning a point when Graham threw the ball through a hoop. Nick and Billy began yelled questions while Neha and Yo-Yo tried to block the blue team from scoring a point, and failing. \"Billy, I'm lost!\" Nick yelled. \"Head up! Head up!\" Billy called back. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's happening?\" Nick continued to yell. Maya stole the volleyball when the other team threw it and ran it to the other side of the field. The blue team immediately surrounded her. \"Maya!\" Neha called. Maya, seeing she was open, threw the ball to her. Neha immediately turned and threw it to Stuart, who was looking down at his phone. The ball hit his head and he looked up. \"What the hell was that?\" He snapped. \"Why don't you try looking up and giving a shit, man?\" Neha told him. Stuart mimicked her words childishly. \"Come on!\" She yelled before running off to get ready for the next play. \"What am I supposed to- Come get me!\" Billy started yelling, taking his broom from between his legs and swinging it around at people who got too close to him. \"Come get it! That's right!\" Sid blew the whistle. \"Get the broom between your legs, folks.\" My bad. Let's go, let's go!\" Billy yelled, putting the broom back between his legs. \"Lesson learned, lesson learned.\" \"What the fuck does this have to do with computers?\" Nick cried. \"Hell if I know.\" Maya called back. Graham made another goal despite Nick's valiant attempt to throw himself between the ball and the hoop. Then they scored another point. Maya stole the ball again, but she didn't have a shot. \"Ball!\" Billy called when he was open. She quickly tossed him the volleyball, but Graham whipped a kickball at his head and stole the ball. \"Thank you.\" He called as he ran off. Maya groaned before chasing after him, but he got a point before she got there \"Time out!\" Billy yelled. \"Time!\" The referee called, blowing the whistle. The teams ran back to their sides and huddled. \"Bring it in, guys. Come on. Let's huddle up!\" Lyle waved them pulled the broom from between her legs and jogged over. \"It's over.\" Neha shrugged helplessly. \"Yeah, out teams a joke.\" Stuart agreed, taking his beanie off and tossing it on the ground. Maya groaned and threw her stupid broom onto the grass. Stuart reached over to absentmindedly rub her shoulder. She sighed and leaned closer. Graham's team had 70 points. There was no way they could catch up in the second half. \"Well I ain't laughing, How about you, Billy?\" Nick asked. \"Hell no.\" He replied. \"Listen, we need to get our minds right and start believing.\" Nick told them. \"This reminds me of a little girl who had to get her head right and start believing, a little girl from a steel town who had the dream to dance. No one believed in that little welder girl, but thank God she believed in herself.\" Billy said. \"Are you talking about Flashdance?\" Stuart asked him incredulously. \"That movie from the 80's?\" She asked Stuart, tilting her head to the side. \"Yeah, you're damn right I am.\" Billy confirmed seriously. \"That's exactly what I'm talking about.\" \"Got it.\" Stuart said, shooting Maya a look. She just shrugged. \"The deck was stacked against Alex, and you know how she overcame those odds? By believing in herself and trying. She literally had to become a maniac.\" Billy said. \"Have any of you ever been called a maniac? Maybe because you were a little bit different?\" Nick asked them. Neha made a surprised face. \"My mom calls me a maniac every night when I tell her I love her.\" Yo-Yo admitted. \"Of course she does, Yo-Yo. You are a little bit, in a good way!\" Nick told him. Yo-Yo nodded his head. Maya leaned over to whisper in Stuart's ear. \"Well, guess what? That old Bill Gates, they called him a maniac, too.\" Nick said. \"No question.\" Billy backed him up. \"Yeah, I don't think anyone ever called him a maniac.\" Maya corrected them. \"I just called him a maniac.\" Nick objected. \"Well, you know-\" Neha started only to be cut off by Billy. \"God damn it, guys, you're getting off the point here.\" Billy said. \"You're right.\" Nick agreed. \"She had to strip down to nothing. She had to sit in that chair and arch her back, and she pulled a chain to nowhere, and doused herself with water.\" Billy told them, miming those actions. \"Yeah, where did that water come from?\" Nick asked. \"Who knows?\" Billy said. \"It came from her belief that it was there.\" Nick answered his own question, reaching his hand up dramatically. \"Actually, it probably came from some type of bucket or latch, or something.\" Maya corrected them, but they ignored her. \"She believed so hard she found herself with an audition in front of those stuffed shirts at the dance school, and she spun… Oh, and she spun and she spun and she spun and she spun and she spun herself into that dance school. And she spun herself into our hearts.\" Billy said. \"Is it weird that this stupid speech is surprisingly inspirational?\" She asked him. He just nodded his head in agreement, both of them looking at Billy. Neha gave him a reluctant smile while Yo-Yo and Lyle nodded along as he spoke. \"Now for the second half of whatever the hell you guys call this game can't we all be that little welder girl who wants to be something more?\" The kids shared some looks, nodding their head. Despite the really dumb analogy, the speech was getting their heads in the game. \"Now, I know you guys aren't excited that we're on your team, but we're here. Guys, we're in this thing together. So I'm asking you, believe in yourselves, believe in each other. Let's put on our leg warmers and let's dance our asses off.\" Maya chuckled at his words before sharing a look with Stuart who nodded. They both turned to Billy and waited for his command. \"Alright, coach, what do we do?\" \"Come in here, you little loveable maniacs. Get in here.\" Nick said, moving closer. They all huddled tightly. \"Now I've got an idea that would make Bear Bryant smile.\" Billy told them. \"No idea who that is, but we're listening.\" Neha informed them. Five minutes later everyone was back in position, and their team was alert and ready when Sid blew the whistle this time. They all ran forward as fast as they could.\" \"Let's go!\" Nick yelled to them. Graham tossed the ball back to his team but Billy jumped between them and hit it, tossing it to Stuart. \"Maya!\" He called, throwing her the ball. The blonde caught it before throwing it to Lyle who ran the ball forward. \"Lyle! Throw it to me!\" Nick yelled. Lyle threw him the ball and Nick tossed it up in the air, and Billy hit it into the hoop. \"Yes!\" Maya yelled, bumping fists with Neha as they ran back to their side. Their team cheered while Graham's team groaned. As Stuart ran he playfully pointed at himself and at Maya, then at himself and back at her as he jogged forward. She rolled her eyes but smile at his excitement. On the next play Stuart used his phone to his advantage and aimed the glare from the sun off of it into the goal keeper's eyes, blinding her. \"Blind her! I'm going in!\" Nick screamed. He ran the ball forward, throwing it to Maya who made the shot. \"Yeah!\" Stuart threw his fist in the air and yanked it back down to his side in a silent cheer. Then he blew on his phone and fist bumped again. \"Yeah Maya!\" Maya laughed and sent him a grin and raised her hand for a high five as she ran by, him slapping his hand against hers. Nick ran back to their side with his finger pressed against his mouth in a shushing gesture, considering it was technically cheating to blind them. Oh well. On the next play Graham's team member almost made a shot, but Billy smacked the ball away from the hoop at the last minute. He started waving his pointer finger at them and shaking his head from side to side. The ball ended up on the ground and everyone ran for it, Lyle sliding on the ground and kicking into the air just before Graham could grab it. Yo-Yo hit it with the end of his broom and it flew over to Neha, who tossed it into the hoop. \"Eat it, Malfoy!\" Lyle yelled at Graham. Billy started mocking a member of the blue team by waving his hand in front of his face like John Cena. On the next one a member of Graham's team almost made a shot but Stuart jumped sideways in the air and smacked the ball away from the hoop, into Nick's waiting hands. He ran the volleyball, using it to block a kickball that was thrown at him, before he threw it into the hoop. \"Yeah!\" He yelled. \"Woohoo!\" Maya screamed. The next play Maya had the ball and the other members of the team surrounded her, running her forward and blocking her from attacks. \"Alright guys, let's do this!\" Neha yelled. The first ones to be taken out by kickballs were Nick and Lyle, but they kept running. Billy, Yo-Yo, Stuart, and Neha all slammed into the players that tried to stop them, Maya running forward. She quickly whipped the ball forward and it sailed through the hoop. \"She shoots she scores, baby!\" Billy yelled. \"Whoo! Way to go Maya!\" Stuart yelled. \"Yeah, baby! What's up!\"Neha praised, high fiving her as the ran passed each other. \"That's my girl!\" Stuart yelled, not even realizing he had made it sound like they were dating. Maya, who was already flushed, blushed deeply and patted his shoulder when she passed him. \"Tie game!\" Sid yelled. Suddenly a guy in a golden onesie and gold spray paint ran onto the field and started dancing. \"It's the golden snitch!\" Lyle screamed. \"Who the fuck is this now?\" Nick asked. \"Get the tennis ball and we win!\" Lyle told the team. The golden guy had a sock hanging from the back of his pants that clearly had a tennis ball inside it. He grabbed the sock and started spinning it around to tease them. Nick and Billy and Graham all shared a look before charging forward. \"Run you big tree!\" Maya yelled after them. Out of nowhere Graham slammed into Nick's back and made him fall forward. \"Come on, ref! You gotta call that!\" Nick yelled at Sid, who was busy helping a large guy who had been hurt. Graham grabbed the back of Billy's broom and yanked it up making Billy fly forward and clutch his genitals. Graham ran forward and tackled the golden guy to the ground, taking the snitch. Sid blew the whistle and the crowd and the players on the blue team all surrounded Graham, lifting him in the air. Graham thrusted his hips and spun the sock around like a lasso, making Maya roll her eyes. \"You can't be serious! That bitch just staked me. That's gotta be illegal.\" Billy complained to Sid. \"Sorry, if I didn't see it I can't call it.\" Sid said apologetically. \"You okay there, golden boy?\" Nick asked the 'snitch'. \"Yeah the snitch is fine.\" The guy answered with a fake smile. \"G D it!\" Yo-Yo cried, slamming his broom to the ground as the team crowded together. \"Don't start that did your best out there today.\" Billy told him. Yo-Yo reached up for his eyebrow but Maya slapped his hand away. \"That's the first time we all came together as a team\" \"God damn it, illy's right.\" Nick agreed. \"Let's keep it rollin'. You know what, let's go get a frosty.\" Nick suggested. \"I'm down.\" Maya said. \"I've got no plans.\" Lyle agreed. \"Yeah, let's do it.\" Neha said, smiling. They all walked together towards the building so they could change and go out for frosties. Twenty minutes later they were sitting in their office lounging around as they ate their frozen treat. Maya was sitting sideways on the couch next to Stuart like they were their first day, but this time her legs were over her lap and she was pressed close to his side. Nick and Billy were sitting in the arm chairs, Neha was in a bean bag chair while Lyle and Yo-Yo were sitting in computer chairs. \"I loved that thing Lyle did. Where he kicked the ball to Yo-Yo.\" Nick said. \"Yeah, where did that move with the broom come from, Yo-Yo? It was genius!\" Maya praised. \"Yeah, what about you? You were so quick we could barely see, Flash.\" Lyle told her. Maya rolled her eyes and Stuart shook her slightly which made her grin. \"And that save, Stuart? It was epic.\" Billy said. \"Dark and Stormy over here kicking ass!\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shut up.\" Stuart mumbled, laughing. \"Come on. Admit you had fun.\" Maya teased. \"Your obsession with your phone came in handy!\" \"Oh, like you're not obsessed with your phone?\" Stuart shot back rather than answering. \"That was smart, blinding her like that.\" Yo-Yo told him. \"Okay, so we all kicked ass today.\" Stuart admitted. \"Yeah!\" They all cheered. They spent the rest of the day hanging around their office, and by the end of it they were a lot closer than the day of the first challenge. From: Stuart At 5:38pm Okay, so maybe they aren't that bad. To: Stuart At 5:40pm They sort of grow on you. Like a fungus :)[Chapter 5] Chapter Five: The next day they didn't get the third challenge until the sun was going down. They needed to create an app and whichever one was more popular by the end of the deadline, wins. \"Alright guys, let's take this new team spirit and let's apply to this app challenge.\" Billy announced. \"We've got this.\" \"Yeah, it's help if we had an idea for an app.\" Stuart pointed out. \"You bet your sweet ass it would, Stewie.\" Nick told him from his seat at a desk. \"No.\" Stuart said without looking up from his phone. \"Never Stewie.\" \"Okay, no Stewie. Perimeter breach acknowledged, Stuart.\" He turned over to Billy who was sitting on the couch playing with a hacky sack. \"It'll feel good when this one warms up to me. You know it's gonna happen, right?\" He turned back to Stuart who gave him a weird look.\"I'm gonna break you down like a two-by-four, bronco. Watch me do it.\" \"Can I call you Stewie?\" Maya asked curiously from her place next to Neha. After their mini party the girls had forgotten all about their dispute on their first day and were becoming fast friends. Stuart looked over at her with wide eyes. \"Uh, w-well, I- Do you- Do you want to?\" He stammered. Nick and Billy shared a sly look that nobody noticed. Maya stared at Stuart for a few seconds before shaking her head. \"Nah, doesn't feel right. You look like a Stuart.\" Maya informed him, making him sag with relief. \"Thank god.\" He whispered so low she didn't hear him. \"Okay guys, let's brainstorm this puppy.\" Billy called. \"We're gonna put the coffee in the pot and let it percolate.\" Nick said, snapping his fingers a few times. \"Let's go.\" \"I think it'll be to explore what apps have been most popular in the past.\" Yo-Yo offered as he went over to his computer. \"Go.\" Nick urged. \"Go backwards or go forwards.\" Billy added. \"Nice.\" Lyle praised Yo-Yo's idea. \"Oh and we could bin it, you know?\" Neha offered before moving to do so. \"Fall out.\" Nick told her. \"Uh, categorizing needle-movers by the type of user.\" Maya told Neha who nodded excitedly and they quickly got to work. \"You're gonna do what?\" Billy asked in confusion. \"There you go, girls.\" Lyle told them. \"Hit it both by function and by old two-prong. You're on the forest moon of Endor, taking out the shield generator, and you're launching an offensive with Admiral Ackbar. It's not a trap.\" \"Alright guys, I don't wanna kill the momentum or the mojo that you have cooking, but to be fair with you labels and categories don't use apps. People use apps. So I have an idea…\" Billy said. \"Nowadays, people are taking pictures, right? They have their phones now; they're out. Something catches their eye, they want to take it. But then the photo's just sitting there... what if they take that photo and instantaneously put it out there on the line and they share it with their friends?\" \"That's Instagram.\" Stuart told him, taking a seat at a computer chair and resting his ankle on his other thigh, using his phone. \"It already exists.\" \"It's one of the most popular apps in the world. Facebook bought them for like a billion dollars.\" Maya explained. \"That's billion, with a 'b'.\" Stuart tacked on. \"Oh no, mine is very different from that.\" Billy waved him off. \"How if your's something very different from that?\" Yo-Yo asked him. \"Because in mine you're taking the photo instantaneously and putting it out there on the line.\" Billy said, tossing the hacky sack in the air and catching it. \"Online.\" Lyle corrected. \"I'm putting my photos out on the line and I'm creating an exchange.\" He said, ignoring Lyle. \"Yeah, that's Instagram.\" Neha said. \"But mine is more of a social sharing on the line that's happening.\" Billy told them. \"Online.\" Lyle corrected again. \"Quick interjection. When you keep saying 'on the line', you do actually mean 'online', don't you?\" Stuart cut in. \"Stuart, don't do that. You don't do that to a man!\" Stuart gave Nick a 'bitch, please' look. \"He's got a million dollar idea right here.\" \"Billion dollar idea.\" Stuart corrected. \"Even better! Let him flow.\" \"Nick, I appreciate it but you can't bring me down. I'm too positive. Come here, let me share something with you.\" Billy said. Stuart just scoffed. \"No. No.\" \"Please- Come. The both of you.\" He gestured to Maya and Stuart. She sighed before standing up and grabbing Stuart's arm to pull him with her. \"I'm gonna explain this to you in a way that's visual.\" \"He's bigger than you two. Be careful.\" Yo-Yo warned. Billy grabbed Maya's shoulders and moved her to stand in front of them, then stood next to Stuart. \"So now you're out there, take a photo of her.\" Billy ordered, making a clicking sound with his tongue. Stuart gave him an unamused look. \"Go ahead.\" Stuart sighed and pulled out his phone, pointing it at her. Maya was wearing really short black high waisted shorts, a back tank top, a loose maroon colored sweater that hung off her right shoulder and had the sleeves pushed up. It was very loosely tucked into her shorts, and she was wearing dark tights with thigh high stockings and her heeled black lace-up ankle boots. Her dirty blonde hair was down in their usual loose beach curls and she was wearing a locket and a bunch of tied cord bracelets and some rubber and charm bracelets. She shrugged before cocking her hip out, tangling one hand in her hair and striking a pose at the camera with a giant smile and a wink. The others laughed at her and Stuart took the picture. \"Now you take that photo, you put it on the line-\" \"Online.\" Lyle corrected again. \"-you put it on Twitter, you put it wherever you want, that is Instagram .\" \"That's Instagram.\" Yo-Yo agreed. \"One hundred percent.\" Neha added. \"I get it.\" Billy told them. \"We're not dummies.\" Nick informed them. Maya just snorted at him earning her a scolding look from the older men. \"Point taken. Now let's go with my concept. Now you've taken a photo instantaneously or not instantaneously, then you take those and send those out on the line.\" \"Online.\" Lyle repeated himself, though he seemed to have given up hope at this point. \"You don't have to say shit. You don't. You just say I like that photo and you share that photo instantaneously on the line-\" \"Online.\" Lyle cut in sounding exasperated. \"-with your friends. Now everyone's exchanging ideas, everyone's exchanging photos. And that's why the photos that are being shared on the line-\" \"Online.\" \"-will be known as Exchange-agram!\" \"Nice!\" Nick called. \"Oh my god.\" Stuart mumbled as he sat back down. \"Holy shitballs, Billy. We don't have time for this!\" Neha yelled. The laptop next to Lyle turned on and Graham's face popped up. \"Greetings fellow interns! Graham Hawtrey here. I've taken the liberty of attaching a link to our app which has already been downloaded two-hundred and thirty times. Oh yeah!\" A picture popped up him and his team in a victory photo with a little trumpet tune playing. Lyle slammed the laptop shut. \"Great, we're gonna lose yet another challenge, we're not gonna get these jobs, and our lives are basically ruined.\" Neha said disappointingly, sitting down. Maya hopped up onto the desk next to Stuart and rested her feet on the side of the computer chair. \"Okay, hold on a second. Your life isn't ruined, you guys are twenty-one years old, you have your whole life in front of you.\" Billy reminded them. \"Do you even know what it's like to be twenty-one right now? I mean, a quarter of the kids coming out of college can't even get jobs.\" Stuart pointed out angrily. \"That's a correct statistic. Mother says you can work hard and go to the right school but nothing is guaranteed anymore. That's life, sorry.\" Yo-Yo added. \"These guys are right. The whole american dream thing you guys grew up on.. That's all it is nowadays. A dream.\" Maya told them. Stuart reached over and placed a comforting hand on her knee. \"You're too young to be this cynical. You really see the world this way?\" Nick exclaimed. \"It's not how we see it, it's just the way things are now.\" Stuart said. \"Alright, that's it. Everybody up. Here we go. Let's go, breath of fresh hair time.\" Billy said, standing up. \"Why?\" Yo-Yo asked. \"We have work to do.\" Maya reminded Billy. \"No no no no no.\" Nick told them. \"Uh-uh.\" Billy said. \"Time to hit the reset button. We're taking it to the street. We need to get our heads right because we need to come together as a team.\" Nick explained. Neha stood up hesitantly. \"What about the app?\" Lyle asked them. \"This is bigger than an app.\" Nick waved him off. \"Okay, by the way we do have something pretty terrific in our back pocket with that Exchange-agram. Just let it marinate, stop saying no before you give it a chance.\" Billy winked at them. \"Oh, that's a winner.\" Neha said sarcastically. \"Let's go. time to light it up forever and never go to sleep.\" Nick said as he and Billy walked out of the room with the others grabbing their things and following after them. \"Can we talk about this 'on the line' online thing again, please?\" Lyle called after the men. \"We're gonna follow the morons?\" Stuart asked Maya. \"Maybe we could use a break.\" She offered before grabbing her bag and hooking her arm with his as they walked. They ended up taking one of the Google buses out into the town, and left their things inside while they ate at a chinese restaurant. When they got there they learned that Billy knew Mandarin. \"Just let me have a bite!\" Maya demanded, giggling as she tried to steal some of Stuart's rice. He moved his plate away from her, blocking her attempts. \"You should've gotten your own.\" Stuart said, laughing as she tried to lean around him and failed. \"I didn't want any then.\" \"You only want it now because I have it!\" \"Exactly!\" \"No. \"Please?\" \"No. \"Pretty please?\" \"Uh-uh.\" \"Don't you love me?\" \"Not enough.\" \"Stuart.\" Maya whined, dragging his name out. \"Maya.\" He mocked. She just pouted at him until he sighed and laid his plate in front of her. \"Yay!\" She cheered making him laugh as they both finished off the rice. They barely noticed the entire restaurant laugh as Billy said something in Chinese. Stuart just glanced up before drinking some of his beer. When he went to put it back on the table Maya grabbed it and took a long drag. \"Get your own!\" Stuart cried, taking it back. \"Why would I do that when I can just take yours?\" Maya asked him with a sly grin. Before Stuart could reply Billy started speaking. \"My friend here says there's a dance club down the street. It's supposed to be great.\" \"You're shitting me!\" Nick exclaimed. They quickly finished their food and paid before walking down the street to where the man said the club was. However, when they entered, they realized it wasn't a dance club. It was a stip club. There were half naked woman in skimpy underwear all over the place, there was music blasting, the lights were dim, and woman were grinding on both poles, men, and each other. Most of them had their breasts hanging out. To: Stuart At 9:57pm What the hell? From: Stuart At 9:58pm This is stupid. Do we have to stay here? To: Stuart At 9:58pm Nah, let's just go back to the bus. Are you sure you want to miss out on all of this? \"Are you sure he said dance club?\" Nick asked. \"You know, I was rockin' Mandarin, he was rockin' Cantonese, something clearly got confused in the middle but I say boom goes the dynamite! Happy accident, right?\" Billy replied. A woman who had her breasts on display walked up to Billy and began walking down the line the group had formed. From: Stuart At 9:59pm Hmm.. Stay here with a bunch of perverted old men and horny sluts with no self respect, or go back to the bus to hang with my best friend. That's a real toughy. To: Stuart At 10:00pm Oh, stop. You're making me blush ;D From: Stuart At 10:01pm Only because you look so adorable when you do ;P \"Show you to your table?\" She offered, stopping in front of Maya who was reading a message from Stuart on her phone. \"Great big world out there my friend. Just three inches up, I beg you.\" Nick called out over the music, nudging Maya's chin up with his fingers. Maya let him and looked in front of her to see a brunette woman with dark make-up and large breasts standing in front of her, staring at her like she wanted to devour her. The woman reached up to stroke her cheek. \"Any questions?\" \"You have such gorgeous bright gray eyes. They almost glow in the dark.\" The woman whispered lowly as she stepped closer and pressed herself against Maya, whose eyes were wide as saucers. The team was staring at the two women. \"Uh, thank you. Got them from my mom's side of the fa-\" The woman cut her off by pressing her lips against hers. Maya froze in surprise before deciding 'what the hell?' and kissing back. The woman slipped her tongue in Maya's mouth and the two made out for a full minute. The woman finally pulled away and grabbed Maya's hand, holding it over her head and leading her off into the club while gesturing for the rest of them team to follow. Maya was lightly pushed down into a cushioned semi-circle chair at a table, and the woman ran her fingers over her cheek again. \"I'll be back for you in a bit, gorgeous.\" Maya stared after the retreating figure of the woman in shock before turning over to Stuart, Lyle, and Yo-Yo who had followed and taken seat. \"What just happened?\" \"You just made out with a stripper.\" Stuart told her, staring at her. \"It was hot.\" Maya blurted out in surprise. \"Holy shit.\" Stuart said to himself with wide eyes. \"I'm not gay! I just… She knows what she's doing.\" Maya explained sheepishly. A blonde stripper led Neha over by the hand with Nick and Billy following after. \"Look at you, M!\" Nick exclaimed, ruffling Maya's hair. \"You're an animal!\" Once they were all seated a woman brought over a tray of full shot glasses. \"Whoo! It's about time this group had a night.\" Billy cheered. \"Let the good times roll!\" Nick yelled before grabbing a glass. \"Here we go! Bottoms up, Yo-Yo!\" Everyone grabbed a glass but Yo-Yo who refused when Nick tried to hand him one. \"I can't. I-I can't.\" \"Why? You're twenty-one, right?\" Nick asked, still holding out the glass. \"Yeah, but my mom says alchohol numbs the brain.\" \"Look, I'm not saying a shot of tequilla is the first step on the journey to self respect, but god damn, maybe it's a step in the right direction. Maybe?\" He held the glass out again and the others raised their own glasses in encouragement. \"Your call.\" \"One shot.\" Yo-Yo relented. They cheered. \"Whoo!\" Maya called. \"Alright!\" Neha cried. \"Atta boy.\" Stuart said, all of them raising their shots in a toast. \"Yeah!\" \"That's it baby!\" \"Whoo!\" \"To a night we'll never remember!\" Nick yelled. Yo-Yo took his whole shot along with them, but didn't swallow it at first. His face contorted as he finally swallowed it, all of them waiting eagerly for his reaction. He opened his mouth and roared. \"Yeah!\" They all cheered him on, clapping. Stuart patted him on the shoulder as they all jumped around. \"You got it!\" They ordered more shots. Half an hour later they were wasted and going insane, dancing around at their table. The woman from earlier, whom she learned had the stage name is Glimmer, finally returned and pulled Maya out of her seat, pushing her onto a small couch before climbing into her lap. Maya reached up, grabbing Glimmer's face and yanking her down for a rough kiss. After minute Glimmer pulled her mouth away and leaned over to whisper in Maya's ear. \"You want me to teach you how to give your boyfriend a lap dance?\" She offered. Maya blinked blearily up at her in confusion before turning her head to see Stuart sitting on the other end of the couch. He had taken off his sweater and was just in a black t-shirt, downing a shot. \"He's not my boyfriend!\" She slurred, the last word turning into a cry as the other woman ground down at just the right angle. The stripper chuckled. \"Maybe, but you want him to be. And trust me, baby girl. He wants you, too.\" Glimmer whispered. \"What do you say?\" Maya was feeling particularly confident with the alcohol in her system and a stripper in her lap, so she nodded her head in agreement. Glimmer slid off of her and Maya turned over to Stuart who was sitting at the edge of the couch, drunk and watching them. Maya gave him a sly grin before crawling across the couch and sliding into his lap. Stuart looked up at her wide wide, dazed eyes. \"What're you-?\" Stuart tried to ask her, but Maya just shushed him, lightly kissing his jaw. She heard and felt him release a shuddering breath beneath her, making her smile before planting and open-mouthed kiss on the space behind his ear. \"Oh my god.\" Maya grinned wickedly before taking his earlobe between her teeth and sucking on it. She heard him hiss and she slowly pulled away, sending Glimmer a nod. The stripper stepped up behind her and placed her hands on Maya's hips while whispering in her ear, guiding her movements. Maya let Glimmer show and tell her how to roll her hips just the right way for a minute before she decided she was ready to do it on her own. \"Holy shit.\" Stuart whispered, staring up at her. His glasses had been knocked askew on his face, his mouth was hanging wide open, and his head was bobbing around as he followed Maya's movements with his eyes, mostly focused on her lace covered breast that was showing since Glimmer pulled her loose sweater and tank top down a bit too much. \"Look at what we've got cooking over here!\" Billy yelled. Maya heard a shutter click and saw a flash, so they both looked over to see Billy had taken a picture of them with Stuart's phone. \"Exchange-agram moment, bitches!\" Stuart raised his hand and the two high fived each other before Stuart and Maya became lost in each other again. Maya ran her hands up and down his firm chest as she ground down on him. Stuart leaned up off the back of the couch so he could press a wet, open-mouthed kiss against her collarbone. Maya's mouth dropped open and she dropped her head back to give him better access as he trailed kisses along her throat. Stuart had to take a trip to the men's room to clean up the mess he had made when Maya had pushed him over the edge. Billy went to accompany him while Maya fixed her shirt to cover her bra and went over to Neha and Lyle, who were watching a stripper in a room with a glass wall. There was water raining down from the ceiling as she danced with the pole. Stuart came back and wrapped an arm over Maya's shoulders while Billy went with Nick to get Yo-Yo his first lap dance. \"I wanna dance!\" Maya called over the music, taking a shot before grabbing Stuart's hand and pulling him after her onto the dancefloor. Stuart put his hands on her hips and pulled her flush against him, the two of them moving in time with the wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed a kiss against his throat. Stuart made a small noise in back of his throat before leaning down to kiss her bare shoulder that her off the shoulder sweater wasn't covering. He trailed kisses up the side of her neck and she sucked on his earlobe while they danced. \"I wanna go in there!\" Maya told Stuart after a while of dancing, raising her voice so he could hear her over the loud music. He followed were her finger was pointing to see the room the stripper was still dancing with water falling from above. He shrugged before pulling her over there. Maya spotted Glimmer and got excited. \"Glim!\" Maya squealed, throwing herself at the woman and planting a big kiss on her lips. She had her arm resting on Glimmer's shoulder while Stuart was standing behind Maya. \"We wanna go in there. Can we? Can we, pretty please?\" \"Sure, baby girl.\" Glimmer agreed tugging Maya after her by the hand. Glimmer unlocked a door that led to the 'Rain room', and she told the other stripper something before gesturing for them to go in. \"Diamond will take good care of you, gorgeous.\" \"Thank you!\" Maya called as she climbed into the room and started dancing with Diamond on the pole, the water immediately soaking her. Stuart, Neha, and Yo-Yo all climbed in after her, dancing on the other poles. \"Whoo!\" \"Yeah baby!\" Maya cheered as she ground against the stripper before switching over and dancing with Stuart, who was dancing like a total idiot. He had taken his t-shirt off and tied it on top of his head like a bandana. Maya laughed loudly as he whipped it around. After a while they decided to get out and dry off. Maya and Stuart went back to the dancefloor and began jumping around with the music. \"This is awesome!\" Stuart yelled to her. Maya threw her head back as she laughed. \"Whoo!\" She cried out before whipping her head around. She looked up at Stuart to find him watching her with a big grin. Her hair was a wet tangled mess, and she still looked beautiful to him. Stuart reached over to wipe some of the hair out of her face, and Maya smile shyly up at him. They started moving their faces closer together, but just before their lips could connect they heard a commotion from over at the bar. They looked over to see Lyle talking to a woman with some dick picking a fight. They ran over along with the rest of the team and stood behind Lyle. \"Looks like somebody need their two way older brothers to fight for him, huh?\" The asshole said, pointing at Billy and Nick who had gotten there first. The others quickly moved in. \"oh, it's the United Colors of Nerd. Do all of you guys work together?I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's a tech company. Free cereal and ugly people?\" \"Yeah, we do work for a tech company, dickface. Now why don't you back the fuck away from our team manager and his girl?\" Maya snapped. \"Shut up, bitch.\" The man told her, making Stuart step forward agrily only to have Billy push him back. \"Oh, whoa! Hey! Come on, take it easy.\" Nick protested as a group of buff guys showed up behind the asshole. \"Is this the Jets and the Sharks? So why don't you guys head that way, we'll head this way, and never the twain shall meet. Have a great night.\" \"Yeah, that's a good idea.\" He said, starting to turn around before swinging back and punching Lyle. Maya caught their team manager as he fell back and Billy swung a punch at the asshole. Nick punched the other guy that tried to jump in on his buddy. Lyle joined Nick while Yo-Yo jumped on the bar and let out a roar before jumping down on one of the guy's back. The guy ended up slamming him down and hitting him. \"My mother hits harder than you!\" Yo-Yo yelled. Neha came over and slammed her foot into the guy's crotch from behind, making him groan and fall to the ground. \"Whoo! Down goes Frazier!\" She yelled. One of the asshole's friends slapped maya across her face and grabbed a beer bottle from the bar and slammed it over his head. It shattered on impact and the guy groaned in pain. Stuart came up behind her and quickly punched the guy in the face making him fall to the ground. \"Take that, you little bitch!\" Maya screamed just before security showed up and threw her over their shoulder, escorting her and the rest of the team out of the club. She heard her friends yelling some stuff as they left the club. \"See you again!\" Neha was yelling at the man she had taken down. \"I'll kill you! Hide your kids! Hide your wife!\" \"That's how you party!\" Stuart yelled. \"Whoo! Yeah, baby!\" Maya cried, high fiving Stuart as the man carried her past him. \"We're too hot to party, that's why they gotta kick us out,'cause they're gonna call the fire department!\" Yo-Yo yelled. They ended up taking the bus to a nice look out area to stare at the Golden Gate Bridge as the sky started to get lighter. Maya was sitting on one of the benches with Billy and Neha, drinking some water while Billy talked to her about her lack of dating experience. Stuart was few yards away with Nick watching the cars driving on the bridge, with his phone in his pocket rather than his hands. Yo-Yo was too wasted to do much more than lay face down on the other bench, and Lyle went off to find somewhere to pee. \"What about you?\" Billy said, making Maya turn her eyes from Stuart to the older male. \"What about me?\" She asked him, confused. \"I mean, you and Stuart. What's going on there?\" Billy reiterated. Neha stared at her eagerly having obviously wondered the same thing. \"N-Nothing. We're just friends.\" Maya said. Billy raised his eyebrows at her. \"You two didn't look like just friends in that club. Or even at Google.\" He pointed out. Maya blushed and looked away. \"What the story there, M?\" \"Well…\" Maya said, looking out at the view of the bridge and the water. \"We grew up in the same small town. We were always friends, but we got a lot closer when we went into high school. People picked on us for being nerds. And we had to lean on each other. He became my best friend.\" Maya glanced over at Stuart and smiled at him when he glanced at her. He grinned back before they both turned back to the view. \"I graduated a year early with a 5.0 GPA, and went to CalTech. It was absolute hell at first since I was younger than everyone there, and twice as smart. I went back to my dorm and locked myself in our bathroom every night and cried.\" Billy put a hand on her shoulder in comfort, and she took a deep breath before continuing with a small smile. \"But one day I texted Stuart, and when he replied I smiled for the first time in months. And talking to him became the highlight of my day, it helped me push through. We called each other, skyped, texted, and emailed, but it wasn't the same. We only got to see each other in person twice in four years. I graduated a few months ago with perfect grades and I was looking for a job… Stuart heard about the Google internship and it just seemed like the perfect chance to see each other again. To work in the same place and see each other everyday. \"We applied and we both got in. We met up in person just a few weeks before the internship started, and there was just this… spark. Like all of the sudden he was more than just my best friend. Like I wanted to kiss him, and hold hands with him, and…\" Maya shook her head. \"I don't know. It just felt like there was something different. He was still the same sarcastic, phone obsessed, dork that I grew up with, but my feelings for him changed. And we started flirting all the time, and whenever we would touch it just felt like it meant more… But we're still just friends.\" \"Maybe it's time to change that.\" Neha suggested, reaching over and grabbing Maya's hand. Maya smile at the two of them. \"Maybe.\" She agreed. She turned her head to Stuart, only to find him already staring at her while he spoke to Nick. She blushed and sent him a shy smile which he returned. They all looked over at Lyle as he stumbled towards them with his phone in hand, singing one of the songs that had been playing at the club. \"Lyle!\" Billy greeted. \"Looks like you hit it off with Saffron tonight.\" Nick called as him and Stuart walked over. Stuart stood at the end of the bench where Maya was sitting and they exchanged small smiles before focusing on their team manager. \"I'm texting her that I love her and I'm sending her this picture I just took of little Lyle when he made pee in the bushes. Look, he's winking.\" Lyle told them, holding his phone out for them to see. Stuart quickly covered Maya's eyes with his hand. \"Lyle, Lyle, Lyle, that's a horrible idea. Please don't do that, you're drunk off your ass.\" Nick tried to object. \"I appreciate your concern but I'm flyin' baby!\" Lyle sang. Stuart pulled his hand away from Maya's face when Lyle turned his phone back towards himself. \"Okay, Lyle you are not flying. What's seventeen squared.\" Billy tried to throw him off. \"Two-eighty-nine, why?\" Lyle said, looking really confused. Maya giggled. \"Give me a harder question than that. you know where I'm driving with this.\" Billy said to the others. \"Try, uh, maybe square-root of seventeen.\" Stuart suggested. \"Four point three two, maybe?\" Lyle guessed. Maya chuckled before handing Lyle her bottle f water. \"Drink this. It'll help you sober up.\" Lyle made a face at her but did as she told him. \"That's the app. That's the app we should do right there.\" Nick said, making them all look at him. \"Some quiz question you gotta answer before you can send a drunk text or a drunk email or a phone call- something to protect you from yourself.\" \"That's good. Can we do that?\" Billy said, turning to Neha. \"Hells yeah we could do that.\" She confirmed excitedly. \"Are you shitting me? I could program the shit outta that bitch on the bus ride home.\" Yo-Yo slurred out to them from his place on his bench. \"We could set it up so they turn it on when they know they're gonna drink, and it'll lock them out of their messages and social sites…\" Maya said excitedly. \"They would set it up with a question they could only answer if they thought really hard.\" \"I'll take that as an overwhelming yes!\" Billy cheered.\"Come on!\" \"Come on, let's get back to HQ!\" Nick called out as everyone started getting up to go back to the bus. \"Hey, w-wait.\" Stuart said. \"Let's- let's stay, like five more minutes, you know. Just, enjoy the view a little more.\" They all shot him surprised looks and Maya smiled before grabbing his hand and pulling him over to Yo-Yo's bench so they could sit down. \"Wow. Yeah.\" Nick agreed as the others sat down at the other bench. Stuart patted Yo-Yo's leg before wrapping his arm around Maya and the two snuggled close to each other. \"You haven't worn your beanie since the Quidditch game.\" Maya pointed out, staring at him thoughtfully. Stuart nervously ran his fingers through his hair. \"Oh, um, yeah. I-I just figured I'd try something new.\" He replied. Maya smiled at him before laying her head on his shoulder. \"I like it.\" They watched the cars driving over the bridge as the sun started to come up, not noticing the others were watching them rather than the bridge. They thought it was a much nicer view.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six: The next day the entire team was nursing hangovers at google. They rearranged the office so the two couches were on the big green rug, facing each other with a small coffee table in between. Nick was sitting on the end of one couch with Yo-Yo laying down on the other end. Lyle was curled up on the other couch across from Yo-Yo with billy sitting next to him and Neha resting against the armchair. Stuart made a bed of bean bag chairs and was laying on it with his beanie pulled over his eyes, and Maya was curled up against the side of the bean bag with her face on Stuart's stomach. Stuart was running his fingers threw her wavy hair. \"The whole world looks like a pinwheel of death right now.\" Stuart groaned. \"Price of making memories, Stewie.\" Nick replied. He was still hungover but him and Billy had enough experience to have thought of getting coffees when they came in so they weren't as bad as the others. \"I'm thirsty.\" Maya whined. Billy, bless his heart, dragged himself off the couch and went out to grab her a gatorade. When he game back he tossed her the drink before plopping back down on the couch. \"I think I love you.\" Maya told him as she sipped at her drink. Stuart reached up and stole a sip while Billy just laughed at her. \"My liver hurts.\" Yo-Yo moaned quietly. \"Can't fix that one.\" Billy shrugged. \"Astonishingly,\" Chetty began loudly as he entered the office. Stuart yanked the beanie off his eyes and put his glasses back on, jumping into a sitting position while they all turned to look at the man. \"You app received ten times more downloads than any of the other teams. It appears that you have won your first challenge.\" \"How 'bout it!\" Billy cheered, fist bumping Neha. Lyle grinned and started to sit up. \"Whoo!\" Maya cheered, hugging Stuart. \"Yeah!\" Nick applauded. \"Come on, baby.\" \"Congratulations.\" Chetty told them. Yo-Yo suddenly shot into a sitting position and puked into a trash can. \"Oh, easy there big guy.\" Billy said. Neha covered her mouth while Maya hid her face in the back of Stuart's shirt. Nick reached over and started rubbing Yo-Yo's back. \"Gets over excited.\" Nick told Chetty before turning back to Yo-Yo. \"Lovely.\" Chetty said, clearly disgusted as he left the room. \"Let it out. Let it out little feller.\" Nick whispered soothingly. After that challenge, everything seemed to fall into place for Team Lyle. That night had brought them closer, and they were finally acting like a team. They used their free time to sit down in some comfortable chairs somewhere at google and explain the basics to Nick and Billy. It was slow moving, but as the weeks went by they learned more and more. The next challenge was about cracking codes which Neha had an affinity for. The team was cheering her on as she wrote on the glass while the other teams were heckling their champion. \"Come on, Neha!\" \"you got it, you got it, you got it.\" \"That's it, baby!\" Chetty slowly walked by, checking the writing before giving them a thumbs up. They all cheered loudly as they won another challenge. \"Yes!\" Maya screamed, jumping at Stuart and wrapping her arms around him. He grabbed her waist and spun her around before hugging her normally. They pulled apart and Maya gave Neha a double high-five, before the whole team started randomly high-fiving each other. \"Whoo!\" Neha squealed, staring at her work in satisfaction. To celebrate their victory the team had an X-Men marathon at Maya's apartment to show Nick and Billy who charles Xavier was. Billy and Nick sat on the couch, Lyle took the armchair, Neha and Yo-Yo were sitting on couch cushions on the ground, and Maya and Stuart were cuddled up next to each other on the floor with Stuart resting his back against the couch and Maya resting against him. everyone had a paper plate with some pizza on it and cans of soda. \"Our Professor X was way meaner than this guy.\" Billy told them. They all shot him amused looks, Neha laughing. \"Wasn't funny at the time.\" Billy said. Nick chuckled at his friend. They found themselves joking around with each other, walking through Google as a group every day. They became closer and closer as the summer went on. One day they were at another lecture between challenges, which was being run by Nick's crush Dana Simmons. \"Guys, when it comes to writing code, you've got your choice of a number of editors. Editors such as Emacs, Nano and VI have features like syntax highlighting and syntax specific autocomplete. Any questions?\" Nick and Graham both raised their hands. Dana pointed to Nick, and Graham shot her an incredulous look that no one even bothered to notice. \"It occurred to me, why not use Emacs rather than VI as the default editor for Ubuntu?\" Nick said. Dana sent him a surprised look. \"That's actually… a very good thought, Nick.\" \"Thank you.\" He whispered. \"VI vs Emacs is a constant debate.\" Billy leaned forward in his seat to shoot Nick a look, and received a sly wink in return. \"Moving on…\" Stuart and Maya had grown closer after their night out, but had yet to actually become a couple. they both knew the other had feelings for them, but neither of them wanted to start something if they didn't get the job. It would hurt too much to start something, only to find out they wouldn't be able to see each other anymore. One day they were both eating lunch in the small food court and Stuart got curious about who she was texting all week. \"Who are you talking to?\" Stuart asked, nudging his chin towards the phone in her hands. Maya glanced up in surprise. \"Oh, um, Tiffany.\" She answered, taking a bite of her sandwich. \"Who is Tiffany?\" Stuart asked. He knew about all of Maya's friends back at CalTech,and she had never mentioned a Tiffany. \"I met her at the club.\" Maya shrugged. Stuart continued to look lost for a minute while he chewed his burger, before his eyes widened and he stared at her. \"The stripper? I thought you kept calling her Glimmer!\" He hissed. \"That's her stage name. Her real name is Tiffany.\" Maya explained. Stuart continued to stare at her with his jaw hanging open. \"She slipped her number in my pocket when we were dancing. After the Rain room.\" \"Are you… Are you serious?\" Stuart asked. \"Yeah. She's actually studying to become a doctor.\" Maya informed him with a proud smile. He stared at her before finally shrugging. \"Tell her I said 'Hi'.\" A couple of days after their most recent challenge, which they won again, Chetty called all of the interns to another large hall, this one with a large screen behind him that said 'Challenge'. \"Only two challenges remain, after which a mere handful of you will be offered full-time employment. Now, the next challenge is manning the Google helpline.\" Chetty announced, the screen changing to say 'Google helpline'. \"This is one of the most difficult jobs we have. Combining both customer relations and product fluency. You will be judged on both. \"Little bules with lines connecting them to the original words started popping up with words inside them, like Earth, Gmail, Chrome, and Wallet. \"This is a very tight race, right now. I suggest you study up.\" Chetty walked off stage and all of the teams rushed back to their offices to study. On the way there Lyle explained that he would be able to help them study but since he wasn't an intern, he wouldn't actually man the phones. \"Alright, let's drill it and kill it.\" Lyle told the group . They had all taken out their complementary Google laptops and found a seat in the room, all of them but Lyle and Maya sitting at a desk. Maya was sitting in a bean bag chair while Lyle was walking around the room. When they manned the helpline they would have a computer in front of them with the details they would give the person they were talking to, but they needed to know exactly where to find which fale they needed, and to do it quickly. \"Authorization failure with Google Drive, Neha.\" Lyle fired off, walking over to the girl in question. she clicked on the file she needed. \"Permissions probably changed. Request document access.\" She read off. \"Bam!\" He cheered before walking towards Nick. \"Chrome connectivity issue, Nick.\" Nick selected the correct file containing the information he needed. \"Unselect proxy server for your LAN.\" \"Nice! Billy, I'm locked out of my Google Wallet account. \" \"Is that under Email, or Wallet Help?\" Billy asked. \"I don't know, sir. That's kinda what I called you for.\" Lyle said, pretending to be on the phone. \"Right. Here's the deal. I'm pretty terrific on the phones. I could sell prosciutto to a rabbi, and I have.\" Billy said, turning away from his computer. \"Except you're not here to sell anything.\" Yo-Yo cut him off. \"Yeah, billy. You're not gonna be able to bullshit your way through this one. \" Stuart told him. \"The only way to nail this challenge is to study.\" Maya explained, shooting Stuart a reprimanding look. . \"You just gotta do it, man.\" Stuart said, trying to sound nicer. \"Well, great. then study up is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna study up/\" Billy agreed, turning back to his computer. Lyle patted his shoulder but Billy turned to ask him a question before he could walk away. \"Let me ask you, is there, like, as a general rule, like, a blanket statement I could say that could apply to literally anything? And then I'm either going to shove product down their face, right, or I'm going to give them another hotline?\" \"What you are exactly is tech support. So if you referred them to another phone number, what would happen is that your phone would ring again, 'cause you'd be the number that they are referring to.\" Lyle explained patiently. \"What I'm suggesting is give me the blanket thing where I'm not necessarily wrong, I'm not necessarily right, and then I'll either hit them with another helpline, a real helpline, or I'll push some product on them. You want me to shove some product down their throat? 'Cause I'll do it.\" Billy said seriously. \"Full disclosure, I think you're working harder than you have to. All you have to do is click the button and read.\" Lyle told him honestly. \"I got it.\" Billy said dejectedly, turning back to his computer. \"Bam, done! Read it.\" Lyle encouraged. \"I got it. I'll do it.\" Billy nodded his head, clicking on something. \"That's my man, Bill. Alright, it's going fine. How's everyone doing?\" Lyle asked the team. \"Yeah, I'm good.\" Stuart told Lyle. Nick turned towards Billy. \"You'll get it.\" He said encouragingly. Maya watched the pair for a minute before closing her laptop and getting up to talk to Billy, making sure she was quiet so the others wouldn't hear her. She slid onto the desk and sat indian style. Today she was wearing her hair down in big curls, and she had dark skinny jeans with a white see through stop with a solid white tank top tucked into her pants under it. She had an oversized dark gray knit cardigan, and knee high brown boots. wasn't wearing any jewelry today. \"Look, I know it's hard admitting you need help. But you're a part of this team, and you can come to us.\" Maya told him softly. Billy glanced over at her before going back to his screen. \"Look, how about I stay later tonight and help you study? We don't have to tell everyone else if you don't want to.\" \"Not even Stuart?\" He asked her quietly. Maya grinned at him. \"Not even him.\" She agreed. They quickly made plans before Maya opened her laptop and went back to studying. Later, when the sun had gone down and Google had mostly emptied out, Maya and Billy met up in the hall where their orientation was held. They brought over a bunch of pillows and made themselves comfortable on the bleachers. With their laptops in front of them, the pair began studying. \"Alright, what if you get a bad request message in Gmail?\" Maya quizzed. \"In Gmail, a bad request message shows if… shows if your internet is down.\" Billy said slowly, selecting the option on his computer and entering. The computer beeped as the word 'incorrect' popped up. \"Son of a bitch\" \"Hey,\" Maya said, putting a hand on his shoulder. \"You'll get it. Some people have a harder time than others. But you're smart, Billy. You'll get this.\" \"Thanks.\" He sighed tiredly, rubbing his face. \"It shows-\" They both jumped when they heard a man's voice from the seat above them. \"Oh my god!\" Maya cried. \"Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me.\" Billy exclaimed. \"if your browser has a bad or outdated cookie.\" The guy continued, closing his own laptop and setting it aside. Maya noticed that he had headphones on, which he was pulling off. \"Wait, you could-?\" Billy asked, noticing the same thing. \"Hmm? Yes.\" The man said as he moved to sit down next to them. \"I can hear everything. I-I'm not actually listening to anything. This allows me to be with myself. I'm not very good with other humans.\" He said slowly. \"Well, I'm not very good with Gmail support.\" Billy said. \"No, actually you're quite horrible.\" The man corrected. Maya giggled and the man seemed a bit startled. Billy chuckled. \"You can do this. This can be learned. But those kids… Like this one right here.\" The man said, glancing at Maya. \"The way they look at you, you have a way with people.\" He covered his mouth and made a weird noise like a cross between sucking a straw and blowing his nose. He wiped his hand on Billy's arm, and Maya stared at it in shock. \"That's a lost art.\" Billy just stared at him, stunned, and Maya burst out laughing. The man jumped this time at the noise. \"Sorry.\" Maya told him, still giggling quietly. She shook her head and turned to Billy. \"Look, Billy. He's right. you have this effect on people, and you don't even realize it. You and Nick, you were given a group of misfits who couldn't get along for five minutes without bickering. We treated you like dirt, but you were still nice, and tried to be helpful even when you had no clue what you were doing. You two brought us together and made us a team.\" She told him softly. \"Have you looked at the others teams? None of them support each other like we do, and we wouldn't have all become friends if it weren't for you two. you're like the crazy uncles we never had.\" \"Thanks, M.\" Billy whispered with a smile. \"Go again.\" The man urged., pointing at the computer. Billy shot him a confused look. \"Go again.\" Billy took a deep breath before looking at his screen and clicking the next question. \"In Chrome…\" He looked up at the guy. \"For you this is like teaching a little kid the alphabet, right?\" \"No, actually it's like teaching a kid a letter. Just one letter.\" He held up one finger to make a point. \"Yeah, you're not- you're not- your strong point would not be communicating to humans.\" Billy told him. \"I know.\" The man agreed. Maya and Billy stared at him for a few seconds before laughing slightly. The man grinned at them, this time not jumping. He even joined in with an awkward wheezy laugh. \"Alright, that was my guy. Alright. Give it to me straight. I like it, no chaser.\" Billy said. \"We're having fun.\" The man said proudly. \"I am.\" Maya confirmed. \"Me, too. I hope you are.\" Billy agreed. they all laughed again before getting back to work.[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven: The next day all of the interns were in little cubicle desk areas with computers and phones. Today Maya was wearing a floral patterned skirt that flared out a bit, tight white t-shirt, a cropped denim long-sleeved jacket, and a pair of wedged heels. Her hair was half-up half-down with loose curls. She was chugging down a bottle of Gatorade to keep herself awake after spending most of the night helping Billy study. And she was texting the guy from last night who she had found out was named Andrew. He was a lot more comfortable talking to her through texts, and after he helped them out last night she really wanted to be his friend. She felt like he could use some. To: Andrew At 8:56am About to start! Billy's super excited. Wish us luck! From: Andrew At 8:57am You two don't need luck. You know this stuff. To: Andrew At 8:58am Thanks, buddy. I'll text ya later and let you know how we do. From: Andrew At 8:58am You are welcome. I'll talk to you later as well. \"Welcome to the Google helpline,\" Chetty called. \"You will man the phones for exactly one hour. Now, before you begin…\" \"I'm so ready for this thing. I was up all last night studying. This is where team Lyle takes the lead.\" Billy whispered to Lyle. They fist bumped. \"...icon accessing your account so that we can review your work later. The helpline… is open now.\" Phones suddenly began ringing. Maya quickly answered hers. \"Hello, welcome to Google helpline. My name is Maya, and I will be helping you out today. What going on?.. Alright why don't you deleting all of your cookies? That might be what's causing it. You did it? Did it work?... Wonderful, I'm glad I could help… No problem. Call back if you have any more issues.\" \"Hi! welcome to the Google helpline, this is Maya. How can I be of service? … Alright that mgith just be because your device isn't compatible with Google Play. Have you ever done it before with this device? … No? Then that's probably why. Why don't you try using a different device and if it still doesn't work, call me back and we'll figure it out.\" \"Time's up!\" Chetty called an hour later. \"So soon? Man, I was just getting warmed up here.\" Billy called. \"Good going here.\" Nick joined in. \"Is smoke coming off this thing?\" Lyle came over and the team began high-fiving each other. \"Come on, ladybug.\" Billy said to Neha, high-fiving her. \"Please submit your log files so that I may review your work later.\" chetty announced. \"Happily.\" Nick said, submitting his files. \"Hit the blue button.\" \"Where's that?\" Billy asked Nick. \"Click the blue button, upper left hand corner.\" Maya told him, submitting her file. \"Mine's not blue, mine's gray.\" Billy told her. Maya froze. \"It's not.. I can't click it.\" \"What?\" She asked him, slowly turning her chair to face him. \"No, the blue one. not gray.\" Nick cut in. \"Mine wasn't clicking. Mine's gray. Is anyone else's gray?\" Billy called. \"Did you not hear my opening remarks?\" Chetty came over. \"Yeah, no, I heard most of your opening remarks. It's just, I was- I was getting in the zone. I was pre-gaming it.\" Billy said nervously. \"I was very clear that you had to log into your account so that I could review your work later.\" Chetty told him. By now the rest of the team was watching, along with everyone else. \"Well, the good news is that you reviewed my work now. You-you don't need the instant replay because you saw the touchdown live, in person.\" Billy said. \"I don't really understand that analogy, but I do know that attention to detail is of paramount importance here and my instructions were explicit. Now, if there's no recording, then it's as if you didn't even show up today.\" Chetty replied. \"Except I did show up.I'm- I'm sitting right here, Chetty.\" Billy said anxiously. \"Well according to your log, you're not.\" Chetty said, looking at Billy's computer then back at him. Maya squeezed her eyes shut. \"And since every intern must complete the challenge in order for your team to be scored… your team will unfortunately receive a score of zero.\" \"Zero?\" Billy repeated. Maya bit her lip to keep from making any noice. \"Well done, Mr McMahon. Perhaps, next time more studying, less pudding.\" Chetty twisted the knife and patted Billy on the back before walking away. \"Chetty, come on.\" Nick protested. \"You're not going to rip us with a technicality. He's right here.\" \"Oh Billy, Billy, Billy. What have you done?\" Graham asked with a smile. \"It's you lot I feel bad for. It's really hard to get here. Some of you are probably pretty intelligent. You deserve better. Sorry.\" \"Why don't you take your fake sympathy and shove it up your freaking-!\" Lyle clapped his hand over her mouth and held her shoulder down when Maya tried to get up. Graham sent her a smug grin before walking away. \"It's alright, el mino. We'll get him.\" Nick patted Billy's shoulder. \"I studied for the test. I studied for the-\" Billy said dejectedly. \"I know, Billy.\" Maya whispered, patting his arm as she walked by. The team grabbed their things and made their way back to their office. The whole walk Maya tried not to cry. \"Well, that's great. That's another win for team Graham.\" Stuart said from his seat in a computer chair. Maya was standing behind him, rubbing his shoulders. \"There's only one challenge left.\" Maya said sadly. \"Even if we're perfect it won't be enough.\" Yo-Yo pointed out. \"We had 'em, too.\" Neha said. Maya looked around but didn't see Billy. She frowned. \"We did, but you know, it's just a little hiccup. A little adversity, alright.\" Nick tried to placate them. \"No, Nick. Come on, face it.\" Stuart said. \"Look, Billy's a great guy and everything, but he kind of blew it for us today.\" \"Yeah, I know-\" \"The kids are right, Nick.\" Billy said, walking in. \" I just wanted to come by and let you guys know that I- I did study last night. I tried my best.\" \"We know, Billy. I was with you last night. You did great. It was just a mistake.\" Maya tried to reassure him, but she couldn't make herself smile. this was her only shot at being with Stuart, and getting a good job at the same time. And it was pretty much down the toilet now. \"It's just, uh, you know today on the phones I just…\" He shrugged. \"It's my fault. And, uh, he was right when he said that you guys deserve better. I'm really sorry that I cost you.\" Billy looked at the ground and left the room. \"Billy.\" Maya tried to call him back but he kept going She went after him. Stuart cleared his throat, knowing what he said probably made things worse. Nick got up and followed after them. \"Damn.\" Stuart whispered. \"Billy!\" Maya yelled, running after him. He just kept going. \"Billy, come back. Please!\" \"I'm just dragging you guys down, M. I'll be doing you a favor if I just leave.\" Billy told her as he grabbed one of the google bikes. \"That's not true! You did amazing today, you just got over excited and made a mistake! That's not a bad thing!\" Maya cried, running after him. \"Billy, please just come back. You're a part of the team!\" \"I let the team down.\" Billy ignored her pleas and kept riding his bike away. Nick ran put a reassuring hand on her shoulder before hopping on a bike and chasing after billy. Maya sighed before deciding to just go she walked to her car she got two texts. One from Tiffany and another from Andrew. From: Tiffany At 10:03am How did you do, baby girl? From: Andrew At 10:18am Did you win? To: Tiffany At 10:22am We did great, but my buddy forgot to log in before we started so he couldn't send his files to our boss after. We got a zero because technically it was like he wasn't even there and everyone had to participate. To: Andrew At 10:24am We got a zero. Billy accidentally forgot to log in. F rom: Tiffany At 10:25am What a rip! I'm sorry, baby. From: Andrew At 10:26am He tried his best. You still have the next challenge. To: Tiffany At 10:27am I know To: Andrew At 10:28am But can we still catch up? From: Andrew At 10:30am The final challenge is the most difficult, and worth the most. It could put you in the lead. Maya read Andrew's text before a wide grin broke out on her face. She quickly texted the team to let them know.[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight: The next day the team, except Billy, were attending the meeting for all of the interns. \"Ladies and gentlemen, it has been an impressive summer. And one final challenge remains. Sales.\" Chetty announced. The team all turned towards Nick who looked down at the table. \"Over a million companies advertise with Google. Find one that doesn't. Convince them. The bigger the sale, the more chance you have of taking this competition. The winner will be announced at our final meeting this afternoon. Good luck. Happy hunting!\" Chetty finished. They all made their way to the office. \"Sales, son!\" Neha said excitedly. \"Man, those other bitches are going down.\" Yo-Yo high-fived her. \"Wait, where's Billy?\" \"He left.\" Nick answered sadly, walking past them into the office. \"What?\" Lyle asked in surprise, \"You heard him. He thought he was holding us back. And he didn't want to talk about it, that's for sure.\" Nick explained, taking a seat. The team gathered around him. \"We gotta get him back.\" Neha said. \"She's right, we're all a team. That's what you guys taught us.\" Yo-Yo added. \"I mean it might of been buried under, like, a mountain of obscure 80's references and just, you know, a ton of other super inappropriate bullshit that I guess was intended as life lessons,\" Maya smacked Stuart's arm when he said that. \"But, I mean, you did teach us how to come together, Nick. You taught us that.\" \"Problem is when he makes his mind up about something, old Billy has a tendency to really dig in. We might have to get ready to do this one without him.\" Nick informed them. \"Yeah. but Nick, we wouldn't want to.\" Lyle said. \"Right guys?\" They all turned to Nick and gave him a serious look. \"We don't want to win unless we do it as a team.\" Maya answered for them. They quickly made plan. Nick and Maya would go find Billy and convince him to come back while the rest of them looked for a business. Maya and Nick were just getting out of the cab at an old folks when Stuart texted her. From: Stuart At 10:53am Neha found one. Sal's Rocky Mountain Pizza Company, a small family business with amazing food and service. You guys got Billy? To: Stuart At 10:54am Not yet. This asshole chose to go far away, so we only just got here. We're about to get him though. Head there and get started. We'll meet you guys soon. From:Stuart At 10:55am Fine. But hurry. \"They found a place. I told them to head over and get started while we get Billy.\" Maya informed Nick. \"Perfect. Let's go get our boy.\" NIck said. They quickly made their into the small courtyard filled with old people, and found Billy standing there. \"Billy!\" Maya called. Said man spun around. \"What the hell are you guys doing here?\" He demanded. Maya raised an eyebrow at him. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" Nick shot back as they walked towards the taller man. \"Billy!\" Some guy with an old woman on each arm yelled. \"Ethel and, uh, Dorris here say they're up for a little group play. Can I count you in?\" He started nodding his head making a weird face, and Maya and Nick both turned to stare at Billy incredulously. \"What the shit?\" Nick whispered. \"What the hell did you get yourself into, Billy?\" Maya demanded. \"Uh, I'm sorry. Randy, this is my old partner Nick, and team mate Maya. Guys this is my new partner. This is Randy.\" Billy introduced them. Nick and Randy started sizing each other up. \"Welcome to the jungle, ese.\" Randy told him before looking Maya up and down, smiling wolfishly. She was wearing a solid white tank top and ripped jean shirts. She had on a blue blazer with big bronze buttons and sleeves that ended just below her elbows, and some black and white converse. She had on two long necklaces that stopped just above her bellybutton, a bunch of bracelets on her right wrist, And her hair was down in their usual thick, dirty blonde curls.. \"How you doin', baby?\" \"Die.\" Maya told him, annoyed. \"Oh, feisty. I love it when they play hard to get. What do you say Billy, can I count you in?\" Randy asked, winking at Maya. \"Uh, you mind giving me just a second here?\" Billy asked, holding up a finger to get his point across. \"No problem.\" Randy agreed, turning back to the women. Billy led Nick and Maya away from them. \"What the hell are you doin'?\" Billy asked them as they walked. \"New partner, huh?\" Nick responded. \"I'm a salesman, Nick. I sell things.\" Billy defended himself. \"Doesn't mean you have to become a sellout.\" Maya informed him. \"Yeah, I remember another guy who was selling some things. Plying the mattress trade when in walks this behemoth. Big guy, big mouth, big dream. And he made this old son of a gun remember there's still some dreams floating around out there. It's not too late, you just gotta reach out and grab 'em.\" Nick preached. Billy stopped walking and turned around to face them. \"Damn it, Nick. I reached for my dreams. Why don't you just leave it alone. I messed it up for everybody.\" He snapped. \"You did not mess it up for everybody!\" Maya disagreed. \"You forgot to click a button! You're not a computer wizard, alright?\" \"You're also not a pussy. You're tough. You grew up in the 70's! Remember what that was like? There weren't any computers, just like we didn't have bike helmets or sunscreens or seatbelts. Did you wear a seatbelt?\" Nick added on \"No.\" Billy answered reluctantly. \"What was your seatbelt?\" Nick asked him. \"My mom would go like this.\" Billy said, holding his arm out at his side. \"Yeah, it was your mom going like that.\" Nick agreed, copying Billy's pose. \"And how'd that work out?\" \"You know, I went through the windshield.\" Billy reminded him. \"Damn, were you okay?\" Maya asked. \"Eighty-nine stitches. Made him look like a little badass all of third grade.\" Nick explained. \"And were you afraid to get back in that station wagon? Nah, five years later you took out that very same car without permission from nobody- not your parents, not old man law, just you and Sally Moran. Parked at the point, finger blastin' away. Didn't even know if you were doing it right!\" \"Ew.\" Maya muttered. \"Nick, where you going with this thing?\" Billy asked. \"I'm saying life is that station wagon! Alright? And, yeah, sometimes it's gonna throw you through the windshield, crack your skull wide open, maybe even break your heart. But every once in a while it's gonna drop a Sally Moran in your back seat.\" Nick tried to explain. \"Look, you two came to Google for a reason.\" Maya cut in, making them both look at her. \"And I can't promise that we'll win. But you need to come back and see it through. Isn't that what you wanted? To actually fight for something worth having?\" \"She's right. Now you get your ass in that car, and you ride home. You hear me, Billy Bojangles McMahon? Ride.\" Nick urged. Billy stared at the ground for a minute before meeting their gaze. \"Let's do this.\" The three of them quickly hopped in the cab. Maya, who was seated in the middle, leaned between the front seats to talk to the driver. \"Sal's Pizza. If you can get us there in less than twenty minutes, you get a fifty dollar tip.\" Maya was thrown back against the seats as the man floored it, and both Nick and Billy reached their arms out over her. She looked at them both before laughing. \"So you two are my seatbelt now?\" \"You're damn right we are.\" Billy agreed. Maya smiled brightly at him before playing with the button on her blazer anxiously as they made their way to their team. They got to Sal's in fifthteen minutes. Maya ordered him to beep the horn, and paid the cab driver the promised price before climbing out of the vehicle. The whole team was leaning against the wall of the pizza shop eating some pizza while staring dejectedly at the ground. Maya noticed Graham's team riding off on their Google bikes, and figured they must have said something. Lyle was the first one to notice them and quickly captured the attention of the others, who turned and started running towards them. \"Welcome back, Billy Boy.\" Lyle greeted with a wide grin. Stuart reached his hand out and Maya immediately went over to him and clasped their hands together. \"Good to be with you.\" Billy replied. \"What happened there?\" Nick asked, pointing to Sal's. \"Uh, well, he didn't bite so it did not go well.\" Yo-Yo answered, scratching at where his right eyebrow used to be. Maya winced at the sight of it. \"You know who else it didn't go well for?\" Billy asked them, and Maya could feel a speech coming on. \"Lay it on us, big daddy.\" Stuart urged. Maya giggled and hid her face in his shoulder before looking back up at Billy. \"That's right, the little steel town girl Alex. When she finally got her shot in front of all those stuffed shirts, she took a tumble and fell. You want to hear something totally nuts? She picked herself back up, she tightened that little ass, and she pumped her legs, and she danced herself right back into their hearts and into a slot at that dance school.\" Billy told them. \"And that's what we're gonna do.\" Nick added, handing Maya a sharpie. She quickly uncapped it and drew a perfect eyebrow on Yo-Yo. \"Tighten your asses. Let's go.\" \"Let's get her done, guys.\" Neha said. \"We've got this.\" Maya agreed, fist bumping Neha. They all made their way inside, and the kids stood behind Nick and Billy who were seated at the counter, talking to Sal and his son Frankie. \"Listen, guys, we've always done things the same way. Yellow pages, flyers, San Jose Mercury News.\" Sal informed them. \"Now, look we're all creatures of habit, am I right Sal?\" Billy said. \"I mean, we all like what we know. There's no question about it. But you know what the scariest thing in life is? The thing in life that frightens us the most? Change.\" \"Yeah.\" Sal sighed. \"And by the way I think most people are guilty of getting set in their ways.\" Nick said. \"I know I need change to come along and give me a little kick in the ass to get me moving.\" \"Now, listen guys. I know where you're going, but I'm not gonna change anything. Like I already told your friends, we're getting by okay.\" Sal told them firmly. \"Now with all due respect if you fight for your limitations you get to keep them. Do you hear yourself? You're getting by 'okay'. \"Okay!\" Nick repeated. \"I mean Jesus!\" \"'Okay' isn't good, 'okay' isn't great, 'okay' isn't fantastic.\" \"I'm starting to think this guy is selfish! Look, I don't wanna get sideways with you. You're as big as a barn. He looks like he was carved out of a damn mountain, for God's sakes. But you're an artist, okay? This is great pizza! Picasso with pepperoni!\" Nick praised. \"And, hey, stop it. Don't even get me started on the sauce. I mean is there nutmeg in there? Something. So look-it, I understand that you don't wanna divulge. But if I'm right, don't say anything.\" Billy said and him and Nick watched Sal who didn't do anything except smile. \"Exactly!\" Nick and Billy cried. \"There's your answer!\" Nick said. \"Sal, come on! All I'm sayin' is, why should Papa Jon's make all the dough when Papa Sal's got the better sauce?\" Billy exclaimed. \"You know what? Now you're starting to sound like him.\" Sal told them, gesturing to his son. \"He wants to open up a Sal's in Los Gatos.\" \"The bigger chains are killing us. We're barely staying afloat.\" Frankie explained. \"When you franchise you lose quality. You lose the taste that people trust.\" Sal told his son before looking back at the team. \"You wanna know why my sauce is better? I'll tell you why. Because I go down to the farmer's market everyday, I buy them tomatoes myself. I walk down the street, I get the basil, the oregano. Look, guys, I know these people. I'm part of the fabric of this neighborhood. That's good enough for me.\" \"Sal, that's better than good enough.\" Billy agreed. \"That's the best. And we're not saying that you should abandon the neighborhood here. All we're saying is, what if that neighborhood got a little bit bigger?\" \"Look at this, Sal.\" Maya told them, laying Nick's tablet on the counter for them to look at. She went to the reviews for Sal's Pizza and scrolled through them. \"These are all people that love your pizza.\" \"Talk about word of mouth, huh?\" Neha tacked on, catching on to what Maya was doing. \"Yeah, they're talking about you, Sal. Don't you wanna talk back to them?\" Stuart urged. \"did you know there are almost as many people in Los Gatos searching for a Sal's as there are in Palo Alto?\" Lyle cut in, showing them the statistics on his laptop. \"Yeah, and they pop in when they're in town, but of there was a location closer to them they'd be regulars, right?\" Neha threw in. Sal and Frankie exchanged a look. \"Boom, check it out right here. Just found a great commercial spot right on Los Gatos Boulevard.\" Stuart announced showing them the location on Google Maps on his laptop. \"Just hit the market.\" \"That's point three miles away from the nearest farmer's market.\" Yo-Yo informed them, showing the details on his laptop. Sal and Frankie shared an astonished look. \"You can smell them tomatoes from your front door!\" Maya exclaimed. \"Farm to table!\" Neha said. \"F to T, baby!\" Lyle called out. \"Come on.\" nick urged/ \"F to T. F to T is exactly right Gomer Lyle! We're not asking you to abandon the artestry. We're just telling you to expand the reach a little bit.\" Billy encouraged. Sal shook his head looking slightly unsure. \"But, look-it, Sal. At the end of the day the kids, they've got their computers, they got their information. It's all accurate, I get it and I know you do, too. But I tell you, Sal. I can't blame you for being a little afraid. Hell, we were scared for a long time out there, grinding it out with our heads down. And Lord knows I've fallen on my ass more than a time or two. But I promise you something. You lift your head up… ...and take a breath, there's a lot of great possibilities out there.\" \"New customers, new franchise... and that's just the tip of the iceberg, Sal. It's all waiting at the click of a button.\" Nick told him. Sal stared at them for a minute. \"Everybody's searching for something, Sal.\" Billy said. \"They're searching for you.\" Nick elaborated. \"We just want to help them find you.\" Maya added. They all stared at Sal, waiting for his answer. Finally, he let out a defeated sigh. \"Okay.\" He said. \"Okay?\" Billy repeated. \"Yeah, let's do this.\" Sal agreed. \"Okay!\" Nick and Billy yeah. Frankie cheered, and Maya high fived Neha and Yo-Yo, Lyle and Stuart fist bumped, and Maya and Stuart hugged each other tightly. \"Yes!\" \"Woohoo!\" \"Get it!\" \"Yeah son!\" \"Alright, Sal. All you gotta do is sign here and we will be in contact with you to help you through this.\" Billy said, sliding the papers over to Sal. Sal shook his head before taking a pen and signing the papers. \"Oh, and Sal, can you do me a favor?\" Billy asked. Sal shrugged and nodded his head. \"Can we get a dozen pizzas to go?\"[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine: On the cab ride over to HQ, Maya was hacking into the Google computers because apparently hacking was her specialty. \"Just how good are you at hacking?\" Lyle asked nervously. \"I hacked into the pentagon a few years ago on a dare.\" Maya replied with a shrug. \"I was the one who dared her.\" Stuart told them proudly. \"Holy shit.\" Neha said. \"Done!\" Maya exclaimed just as they pulled up to Google. Nick paid the cab driver and everyone climbed out of the car and making their way to the door of the hall where the meeting was taking place. Maya pulled out her phone and with a few clicks the giant screen behind Chetty started making creepy groaning noises as it was forced to change from pictures of interns, to an animation of little disco dancers that had Team Lyle's heads pasted on. The song What A Feeling from Flashdance started playing and the little disco people danced to it. \"Way to go, M!\" Nick cheered. They all ran inside holding several boxes of pizza. They all had a little jump in their step and they danced to the music. \"What's going on?\" Chetty demanded. They all started dancing down the aisle passing out pizza's. Chetty tried to get everyone to calm down, without success. \"You get a pizza, and you get and pizza! You all get pizza!\" Maya cried as she tossed her pizza boxes to the crowd. The boys opened their pizza boxes and started handing out slices, Billy tossing them into the crowd. When her hands were empty she continued to dance down the aisle, hip checking Neha before they both flipped Graham off. They danced their way to the front, and danced around with each other as they waited for the others to get there. Billy started lowering a slice into a random girl's mouth as her and her friends cheered before he just dropped it. \"Nice!\" She heard Sid call as he and most of the crowd clapped along with the music. The rest of the team joined the girls and Stuart threw an arm over Maya's shoulders as they watched Billy rile the crowd up by twisting a slice of pizza around and holding it up to his ear. They cheered louder and he threw the pizza up towards the balconies, hitting some random guy in the face. Maya threw her head back and laughed at that. \"Come on!\" Billy exclaimed before dancing up to chetty and holding up an unopened pizza box with the papers Sal signed sitting on top of it. \"Extra toppings on this one, boss.\" \"I see that.\" Chetty state, looking over the papers. Billy clapped spinning around, rolling his fists around each other then striking a pose with one leg extended and the opposite hand pointing to the sky. \"Yeah!\" Billy called, the crowd cheering louder. \"That's enough! That's enough!\" Chetty called as Billy made his way over to his dancing team. Maya took out her phone and turned the effects off, leaving the screens wallpaper up, and the music off. The crowd stopped clapping, looking disappointed. \"It's lovely theatrics, but the jig is up. It's too late. Rules are rules, right Chetty?\" Graham called out smugly. \"Yes, rules are rules.\" Chetty said. \"And the rules state that every team ahs the right, until the announcement is made, to turn in their sales.\" Stuart pumped his fist and squished Maya into his side as Neha and Yo-Yo shared an excited look. \"So, in spite of your lack of punctuality, which is astounding, I have no choice but to accept this submission, and to recalculate.\" Chetty told them. the team clapped and cheered quietly. Chetty and Sid the pizza and Sid gave him a tablet to calculate the results with. \"Go ahead. One small sale to a family pizza joint's not gonna make a difference anyway.\" Graham said. \"It does seem that Mr. Hawtrey is correct once again.\" Chetty called. The smiles fell off the team's faces. \"Boom!\" Graham said. \"The sales to one small shop on the last challenge are not enough to put you in the lead.\" Chetty told them. Billy apologized to Nick and they patted each other on the shoulder. Maya took a deep breath and hugged Stuart tighter, grabbing Neha's hand. Lyle patted Yo-Yo's shoulder. \"But, this is not one shop.\" Chetty started walking down the steps of the stage as he spoke, everyone watching him as he walked over to the team. \"You see, this… is a blossoming franchise with endless possibilities, thanks to you. And what you have done as a team is connect to people, and connect those people to information. Which is what we do. And more than that, you had the courage to dream. In spite of your obvious and astonishing limitations, you never gave up on that dream. So, gentlemen and ladies-\" \"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Hold on.\" Graham interrupted as he got up from his seat. \"Chetty, no offense… You're a glorified babysitter.\" \"He's the head of the Google internship program for a reason, you asshole!\" Maya snapped at him. He ignored her. \"Let's get someone down here who actually means something!\" \"I'm right here!\" A voice called out from the crowd. \"Terrific.\" Graham said sarcastically when he saw who it was. Maya looked over to see the guy from the other night who had helped Billy study. Everyone watched and there were murmurs from the crowd as he got up from his seat and made his way up to them. \"Hey buddy!\" Maya cried happily. Andrew sent an awkward smile in her direction. \"Graham, please meet Mr. Anderson.\" Chetty introduced, looking a bit amused. \"You know this guy?\" Billy asked. \"I should think I do. Andrew here is the head of search. A rather important position here at Google.\" Chetty explained aa Andrew took off his headphones and stopped in front of Graham. \"Honest, it's an honor.\" Graham said nervously, clearing his throat as Andrew just stared at him. \"Look at you, Headphones. A little mystery behind the boy.\" Billy commented. \"How do you two know him.\" Graham demanded. \"He's my buddy.\" Maya said, stepping forward and bumping fists with Andrew. \"He did us a solid and helped Billy study. We've been text buddies ever since.\" \"We were encouraged to reach out to experienced Googlers. Pretty simple, not a big mystery.\" Nick replied. \"To reach out to other Googlers, not just kiss their asses.\" Andrew said to Graham. \"Ohhh, the sass is real.\" Maya whispered. \"You see, these interns are smart, collaborative, pretty,\" He directed the last one at Nick who nodded his head and whispered 'thank you'. \"and just weird enough to make them interesting. Also, they came together as a team to do something here. Their googliness is truly off the charts.\" \"Oh my god. Can we just stop with the googliness.\" Graham groaned as he rubbed his hands over his face. \"What does that even mean?\" \"The fact that you don't know what it means is why you will never work here. Also,\" Andrew lowered his voice and stepped closer to Graham. \"you just made me use a bunch of words in front of a ton of people. Look at me.\" He leaned back to look Graham in the face. \"You're a real dick for doing that.\" He leaned back again. \"Look at me again. And I know your accent is bullshit. What?\" He dragged out the last word in a high-pitched voice. before walking away. Maya stared after him with her jaw hanging open and a wide smile. \"The sass master.\" She laughed before yelling after him. \"Text you later, Buddy!\" Chetty turned to them. \"So… Welcome to Google.\" They all broke into wide smiles and the crowd started clapping and cheering. \"Ha ha!\" Nick cried. \"Yes! Yes!\" Neha squealed. \"Oh yeah, baby!\" Lyle yelled. Stuart grabbed Yo-Yo's shoulders and shook him in his excitement, and Neha and Maya started jumping up and down. \"Whoo!\" Maya cheered. Neha jumped at nick and hugged him. Lyle hugged Nick and Maya wrapped Yo-Yo in a hug. Yo-Yo and Lyle both jumped up and bumped chests. \"I have a job!\" Yo-Yo smiled in disbelief. \"I have a job.\" Stuart turned over towards Maya to see her smiling at him, and she never looked more beautiful. Her dirty blonde curls bounced as she jumped around and her bright gray eyes were lit up with elation and she smiled widely. She was practically glowing, \"We did it! We actually-\"Stuart didn't even think about it before he cut her off, grabbing her face and pressing his lips against hers. Maya froze in shock and Stuart slowly pulled away, starting to panic as he realized what he'd done. But before he could even apologize she started smiling again and wrapped her arms around his shoulders, reaching up to kiss him again. The team cheered as the couple kissed passionately in front of everyone there, oblivious to the clapping and wolf whistles aimed their way. They slowly pulled apart and smiled at eachother before Maya wrapped her arms around Stuarts waist and he tucked her against him with his amrs over her shoulders. Nick clapped Stuart on the back. \"Way to go, Stewie!\" \"Finally!\" Neha shouted and she grabbed Maya's arm and shook it. Billy came over and ruffled her hair. \"About time, M!\" Billy told her. \"Get some, baby!\" Lyle cheered. \"Since when do they like each other?\" Yo-Yo asked, and the whole team laughed at how oblivious he was. Maya leaned her head back and smiled up at Stuart who returned it before leaning down to kiss her again.[Chapter 10] Chapter Ten: A few days later Team Lyle was gathered around each other before Stuart, Neha, and Yo-Yo had to head back to their colleges. Maya had graduated last year since she graduated high school a year early and went straight to college. Maya was wearing a white lace crop top with a salmon colored skater skirt, a jean jacket and white converse. Her hair was down in her usual loose curls, and she had a few bracelets on her right wrist along with a long necklace that ended just below her breasts. \"Have a great senior year, guys. We'll keep your desk chairs warm for you.\" Lyle told them. \"Team Lyle!\" \"Team Lyle!\" They all cheered, putting there hands together before it turned into a giant group hug. \"Yo-Yo! Come now!\" A Chinese woman called from next to a silver car. \"Mom, I need a minute. Yo-Yo told her. She started talking at him in Chinese. \"Mom, I'm saying goodby to my friends. I'm taking a minute. Okay?\" Yo-Yo interrupted her firmly. She froze before nodding. A man in the driver's seat who looked just like Yo-Yo turned his head and Maya saw that he was missing his right eyebrow, too. He gave his son a shocked smile and a thumbs up. \"Look who grew an eyebrow, Yo-Yo!\" Billy exclaimed, nudging Yo-Yo's arm. \"Look at you!\" Maya praised. The whole team congratulated him before they all shared another group hug. \"Alright, you riff raff. Get outta here!\" Billy told them. \"See you down the road.\" \"See you, bud.\" Stuart told him and Nick. \"Bye.\" \"See you next summer.\" \"Bye, guys.\" They all said their farewells before Lyle walked off with his girlfriend Marielena. Nick and Billy walked off together. Yo-Yo went to his parents and Maya walked with Neha and Stuart to the Google bus which would take them back to their colleges. Stuart had an arm around Maya's shoulders and his suitcase in his other hand, and she had her arms wrapped around his waist. \"Don't be a stranger, you two. Shoot me a text sometime.\" Neha told them. \"Forget that, we're gonna come see you in person.\" Stuart told her. \"Hey, guys, I grew a pair of balls. Did you see that?\" Yo-Yo told them as he walked up to them. \"We did. It was amazing.\" Neha praised. \"A big pair of balls.\" Stuart agreed. \"They're touching my ankles.\" Yo-Yo said. \"Okay.\" Stuart cut him off. \"We don't need that.\" Maya helped Neha load up her luggage as Stuart loaded his on his own. When their suitcases were in the bus Stuart and Maya hugged each other. \"I'm gonna miss you.\" Maya sighed. \"I'm gonna miss you, too. But we'll be texting everyday, and I can call you or Skype you between classes. You'll let me know what it's like actually working here.\" Stuart tried to soothe her, though he gripped her tighter. \"And we'll visit each other as much as we can. You can come stay with me over your breaks.\" Maya added. \"See, we've got this all figured out. And when I graduate-\" \"Which I'll be there for.\" \"We'll be working together. We just have to be patient.\" \"Fine.\" Maya sighed, pouting when they pulled away from each other. Stuart lightly placed his hands on either side of her neck and leaned down to kiss her. They forgot about the world around them and didn't separate until Neha shook them. \"The bus is about to leave, guys. We have to go.\" \"Bye.\" Maya whispered. Stuart leaned down and pecked her on the lips. \"Bye.\" He slowly pulled away from her and climbed onto the bus. Before Maya could get too sad Nick and Billy stepped up on either side of her and started escorting her to their cab. \"Come on, M. We're taking you out for a celebratory lunch before we start our first day of work.\" Nick informed her. Maya shook her head before smiling and giving in. \"You're paying.\" She told them, making them groan. She giggled before checking her phone when it went off. From: Andrew At 11:36am Congratulations. From: Tiffany At 11:42am Good job, baby! From: Stuart At 11:53am I miss you already and the bus hasn't even left. Maya grinned before replying to them and shoving her phone in her bag. \"Let's go, boys.\" The guys grinned at her before Billy opened the cab door for her to get in first. \"Let's.\" He agreed. \"You know, this has been one hell of a summer.\" Nick commented. \"Hell of a summer.\" Billy agreed. \"And it only gets better from here.\" Maya added. ","Summary":" Disclaimer for the whole story: I do not own The Internship, but i do own my OC. Enjoy! Chapter One"},{"Movie":"Internship","Title":"Just Press Play","Author":"CreateAnInsaneWorld","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10152601","Passage":"[Chapter 1] So, I've become absolutely addicted to this movie. As it has my love of comedy that is Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson with my love of the attractiveness that is Dylan O'Brien. Then when I actually watched it, I fell in love with the story and the characters. Both Stuart and Lyle are my favorite characters. Anyways, this is a Stuart/OC romance rewrite of the movie. Disclaimer: I don't own anything. I hate Mondays, she thought to herself as she stalked into the building. Her head was pounding and the world around was slightly spinning. She paused and took a deep breathe; the seductive aroma of coffee filled her senses. Turning, her eyes landed on the café. Her mouth watered at the sight of the caffeinated beverages. \"Rough night?\" A light and familiar voice asked. Without sparing them a glance she responded, \"Fun night, but rough morning.\" \"Oh?\" \"I drank way too much last night, Marielena.\" She told her best friend, who laughed softly. \"I know. I was there.\" She couldn't take it anymore, she needed to have one or she would either die a slow, agonizing death or end up killing someone. She probably wouldn't do well in prison and like hell would she be someone's bitch. Plus orange is so not her color. \"And why didn't you stop me?\" She moaned agonizingly as she started towards the café. \"Because I was a little busy working.\" She flinched as she remembered that little detail. \"Right.\" She paused as a thought came to mind, albeit painfully. \"Do you co-workers think that it's weird that I show up every weekend? I mean it's not like I'm gay or anything. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm straight as they come and people there probably talk and wow the room is spinning very much right now.\" She reached out quickly to brace herself on a chair that was nearby. \"You okay?\" Marielena asked worriedly. \"I think so. Just used to many words.\" She mumbled as her equilibrium came back to her. \"Do you need anything?\" \"Coffee.\" She heard her friend make a disapproving noise in the back of her throat. \"You know you can't have it.\" \"But-but Mari! I'm dying here. If I'm going to survive work today and Lyle freaking out about choosing the interns I need coffee. \" She stressed out finally turning to her friend. \"And Lyle will kill me if I let you have coffee.\" Marielena pointed out and she huffed knowing that she was right. He would kill her despite having the biggest crush on her. \"Who says he has to know?\" She was whining and she honestly wasn't ashamed to admit that at least right now. No doubt once it felt like her head wasn't going to implode, she probably would be embarrassed. \"Jake would tell him.\" She cursed, \"He had to tell him not serve me coffee since we found out.\" \"He's worried about you.\" \"I know.\" She said reluctantly eyeing the sweet nectar that was stilling calling out to her. \"Find I'll get a hot tea.\" \"Good choice.\" She glared at her friend, \"I hate you.\" Marielena grinned at her, \"I love you too.\" \"Don't you have dance class to teach?\" \"Not for another hour, but I should get ready and warmed up. I'll see you for lunch?\" She asked, and she had to carefully think over her schedule for the day. \"I don't think so. I have a meeting with my department head. He wants to go over a new layout for Play and it might run late.\" \"I don't know how you deal with him. He's a creep.\" \"Yeah, but what can I do? That's where I want to be and if I have to deal with a slightly pervert boss then so be it.\" She explained seriously as they arrived at the counter. \"I'll have a hot tea with honey, two lemons, and a Splenda, please.\" She glanced over the pastries. \"And a toasted bagel with cream cheese.\" \"Does Lyle know what's going on? I'll have mixed berry smoothie and a warm blueberry muffin, please.\" She let out a curt laugh. \"God, no. Can you imagine how he would react?\" \"He'd tell your mom.\" \"After getting himself hurt for trying to protect me.\" \"He's your older brother, sweetie. That's what they do.\" Marielena said knowingly. She rolled her eyes, \"And as much as I love him for it, it's none of his business.\" She grabbed the drink and bagel from barista. \"Thanks Jake. I'll see you guys later.\" With that she left. Taking a drink of her tea, she thought over what Marielena said. Logically, she knew her friend was right and that she should tell Lyle or someone what was going on and on several occasions she almost had, but then her mother's words from this morning echoed into her head. Just leave well enough alone, Maya. You won't get anywhere by causing unnecessary trouble. Why won't you leave that god forsaken building and find a nice young man? You're not getting any younger and you're my only hope for grandchildren. She repeated pressed the elevator button to release some tension from her body as her own words sprung to mind. Because I love my job and I'm twenty-one years old. I'm a little young to worry about a family right now. And if Lyle would get off his ass and ask Marielena out then he could give you grandchildren. Now if you excuse me I have to get ready to go to that god forsaken building. Goodbye, mother. She slapped the button as the door opened and she was thankful that no one was entering with her. She sighed tiredly leaning her side against the wall of the elevator, her finger hovering over the button to her floor before pushing a completely different one. She had a brother to kill. \"Lyle Marcus Spaulding!\" She shouted as she entered his office. The man in question jumped, surprised at the sudden noise. Spinning in his chair, he flinched at the sight of his sister staring down at him with murder in her eyes. \"M-Maya! What are y-you doing here? Sh-should you be in your office?\" He stuttered over as he stood up. \"Did you even come home last night?\" She asked her brother already knowing the answer. \"La-last night? N-no I didn't. Uh-why?\" \"Because mom called this morning wanting to talk to you, but no! You couldn't have been bothered to come home, so guess who had to deal with her overbearingness? That's right me!\" She snapped making him cringe both in fear and sympathy. \"I'm sorry, Maya. I was doing some last minute things for the interviews today.\" He told her causing her to deflate as she moodily sat down on the couch that was in his office. \"She pulled the ' why don't you find a nice young man' card.\" She said bitterly as she pulled her feet up and lay back down. She sighed happily feeling the cushions form to her body. Lyle had the best couch ever. \"You're twenty-one not thirty. You have plenty of time to find someone.\" Lyle reasoned. She moved her head back to look at him with a doubtful look on her face. \"You've met our mother right?\" She asked sarcastically. \"She also said that I'm her only hope for grandchildren.\" \"And this is why we don't go visit for the holidays all the time.\" He pointed out, turning back to his computer. Guilt welled up in her chest. She hated that their mother was always putting them down for something; if wasn't for her choice of career then it was Lyle's lack of love life. \"You know you could always just ask Marielena out and see what happens.\" She told him softly. He tensed at her words; jaw tightening as he determinedly stared at his screen. \"Lyle, she might just surprise you.\" \"She doesn't know who I am other then I'm your older brother.\" He informed her blandly. She shook her head; wincing at the pain it brought her, \"That's not true.\" \"The only time we talk is when she's informing me on when you veer off on your diet.\" She rolled her eyes, \"Fine. Whatever. I better get to my office.\" She said standing up; she finished off her tea, tossing it in the nearby trash can. \"Will you be home tonight?\" She asked making her to her brother. \"Yeah. I'll pick up dinner. Thai sound good?\" He asked looking up at her, his head tilting back. She poked his forehead before leaning down pressing a quick kiss. \"Torchwood marathon?\" He grinned, nodding in agreement, \"Awesome.\" \"I'll see you tonight.\" \"Wait-so you convinced them to allow two forty-something men with absolutely no skill in coding or anything computer related to become interns, how?\" She asked incredulously as she snuggled back into the cushions with Captain Jack Harkness on screen and a container of Lime Chicken Stir Fry in her hand. \"I pulled the diversity called.\" She let out a laugh while nodding in appreciation, \"Nice. So, you do know that this is most definitely going to blow up in your face?\" \"Oh, I know.\" He said after having a bite of his Baked Salmon in Red Curry Sauce. \"But it should be interesting.\" Reviews are loved! I actually have about five chapters done. I'm just about to write the Quidditch scene. -ARF[Chapter 2] I was going to post this on Saturday, but I couldn't wait! Thanks everyone who reviewed, followed, or favorited the story. You're are the best and anyone in the future who does the same: AWESOME! But the interns have arrived at Google! Disclaimer: I don't own anything! One Week Later Maya, Marielena and Lyle stood on the second level, staring down at the mass of interns, who were looking a mixture of loss, excited and nervous. Maya's blue eyes roamed over the sea of newbies with a distant expression on her face before landing on two people, who really didn't belong. She nudged her brother with her elbow. \"Found the charity cases.\" She told him softly, watching as he zeroed in on them as well. \"This is so going to end badly.\" He muttered dejectedly. She patted his arm sympathetically. A ping from her bag stopped her from saying anything. Grabbing the tablet, she clicked on the new message icon. Her blue eyes roamed over the screen before a scowl settled on her face. \"Fucking useless newbies.\" She muttered darkly as she tapped out a quick message. \"Problem?\" Marielena asked both her and Lyle's eyes watching her in concern. \"A first year just screwed up the programming for the new layout. Parsons wants me to fix it.\" She explained, pushing away from the railing. \"I'll see you guys later.\" She walked away, her eyes going back to the tablet as she pulled up the program that she had been working on for the past month. As the familiar coding appeared on her screen, she walked down the stairs passing one of the older interns her brother was talking about and Dana, an executive that has always been nice to her. \"I'm Nick Campbell.\" The blond man said with a slight southern accent. \"Dana Simms.\" She didn't hear the rest of the conversation, but she knew Dana well enough to know that she blew him off. Maya was right in the middle of reviewing the code when it happened. She will be the first to admit that when interrupted, she could get a little mean. Or a lot mean if asking her brother. She would rant and curse the person to the next millennium that they would be so terrified that they would stay away from her for the next four months and even once they started talking to her again they kept a fair distance from her. Poor Sid still won't look her in the eye. So, when someone deliberately stepped into her path way, she's not surprised that she flipped out, but she handled it better than most days. Clutching the tablet to her chest, she stepped back from the person she had walked into. A scowl once again appearing on her face as she looked up at the person. It was a male around her age. Light brown skin and dark brown eyes that were leering down at her and what apparently was supposed to be a charming smirk on his thin lips. He was wearing a pair of gray slacks with a cream button up and a gray blazer. He was even wearing that ridiculous pinwheel Google hat on top of his black haired head. Just the sight of him made her want to hit him. \"Pardon me love. Wasn't watching where I was going.\" He said with a soft British accent. She was able to stop herself from rolling her eyes. \"I'm sure. Now if you would excuse I'm late.\" She tried to step around him, but he stopped her with a hand on her arm. \"The meeting isn't starting for another five minutes. Maybe I could escort you?\" He asked charmingly. She smiled a little smugly at the fact that he thought she was here for the internship. \"What college are you attending?\" She asked him randomly. \"Georgia Tech.\" \"And you're majoring in Computer Engineering, right?\" She asked, seemingly curious. \"How'd you know?\" \"You seem the type.\" \"Really? Well, if we're going to be honest then you don't seem like the type to be here for an internship.\" He noted, \"You look like you should be modeling as you are very beautiful.\" He told her charmingly. This she rolled her eyes at. \"Well I'm not here for an internship.\" She confessed, \"I'm here for work.\" He looked startled at the information. \"I-I'm sorry?\" \"I work here. Third year Googler at your service.\" She announced brightly as she watched him stared at her stunned. \"But-but you're my age. How can you be a third year?\" She looked up at him in contemplation, \"I think it's called graduating high school earlier and going to Cornell at the age of 16. Now if you would excuse me I have to go.\" This time she was able to make it around him, but again he stopped her. \"I'm terribly sorry the mistake, miss. I just assumed…\" He trailed off like he was uncertain. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath before whipping around. \"I know what you assumed. You thought you could charm your way into my team and into my pants. Just a heads up being a kiss ass to every Google employee isn't going work here. Now I really do have to go because you just made me even more late to clean up some first year's mess. So I would suggest that you. Back. Off.\" She snapped at him before turning back around and making her way to where Parsons wanted to meet. It would be where orientation would be held. Weaving through the sea of interns, she was able to spot her boss talking to Chetty, Head of the Intern Program. She bumped into someone side again and she muttered a quick apology glancing up to see a boy engrossed in his phone. He was wearing that ridiculous hat that was covering his chocolate brown hair and had a pair of thick black rimmed glasses that would look dorky on anyone else, but seemed to actually work for him. He was wearing a dark blue button up with the top button undone. He was cute, really cute actually. He didn't even spare her a glance as he walked to take a seat. Shaking her head, she brushed off the past five minutes and finished making her way to her boss. \"Mr. Parsons?\" She called out as she stepped up on to the platform. \"You wanted to talk to me.\" Both men looked up at her when she approached. \"Ms. Spaulding, coming to see the new interns?\" Chetty asked politely. She smiled at him, having always found him amusing in his mannerisms for some reason as she shook her head. \"Not this year. Don't want to take the spot light from my brother as his first year manager.\" She told him lightly. A look of understanding settled on his face as he glanced over to where Lyle was now sitting on the couch between Jason and Sarah. \"Yes, well he's already making an impression.\" He told her blandly no doubt referring to the two older interns. \"Maya, we'll have to talk after orientation.\" Her boss, Julian Parsons, said as he pointed to an off to the side, where other Google employee were lounging. \"Why don't you take a seat over there and we'll discuss the issue once we're done?\" He asked as gave her a quick look up and down. She resisted the urge to wrap her arms around herself, thankful she was wearing layers today. \"Of course, Mr. Parsons.\" She said respectfully. Giving a parting smile to Chetty, she turned on her heel and walked over to the side. She stood between two employees who work in Google Trends that she frequently dealt with. After saying a quick hello, she went back to her tablet hoping to get a little work done as the familiar words of the opening meeting washed over her. \"My name is Robert Chetty and I am the head of the Google Intern Program. Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship. Oh-no. You will do what we do and we will watch how you'll do it.\" He paused for a short moment and Maya looked up from the coding to see that the Noogler, as Sid liked to call them, watching him in rapt attention. Her eyes scanned over the group, first catching the older men. She shook her head slightly still not knowing how they actually bullshitted their way here before they lowered and went to the right a little where Cute Phone Guy was. She eyed him and as if feeling her stare, he glanced over to her. He seemed startled as their eyes connected and she didn't have to be close to know that his eyes had widened slightly. She smirked to herself as she turned back to her tablet. \"Now you represent the finest schools. Your intelligence, your achievements are well noted, but to excel at this internship you're going to need far more than brain power. What you are going to need is googliness. \" The laughter that followed had her glancing back up again and shaking her head at the Noogler's. If only they knew, she thought as her eyes caught something on her screen. Her fingers rushed over as she finally caught one of the problems that Henry had apparently made. \"Nothing funny. Googliness. The intangible stuff that made a search engine into an engine that changed.\" It was silent again and she knew that they were practically hanging off his every word. \"Now you'll be divided into teams and by the end of the summer only one team will be guaranteed a full time position. The other 95% of you will not.\" She mentally winced at the harsh reality of the competition. \"Now you'll split up into several seminars to acquaint you with our campus and culture. The seminar descriptions have been emailed to each of you. I would wish you luck, but it's not luck you need. Get to work.\" Raising her head as the interns stood up and rushed out, checking their email as they went. Looking around, she was disappointed to see that Cute Phone Guy was no longer in the room. She had hoped to at least grab his name. \"Maya?\" She looked up at the sound of her name and plastered on a smile for Julian. \"What have you found out about the hick up in the programming?\" Glancing down at her tablet, \"From the looks of it was just a mistake in the formatting and coloring. Nothing to major that I couldn't fix, but I'll continuing going over it to double check.\" She informed him. He nodded seemingly happy with what she told him. \"Perfect. How about we grab some lunch? Throw around some new ideas for some apps.\" He suggested causing her to stiffen. She gnawed on her lip, \"I would Mr. Parsons, but I promised Lyle that I would eat with him today. We were going to talk about our mother's upcoming birthday.\" \"Right. Of course. Maybe some other time.\" He said. She didn't say anything as she gave him a tight smile. \"I better get back to work.\" She ended their conversation. He nodded in agreement and left her standing where she was. Letting out a breath she didn't know she was holding, she looked around to see that she was alone in the room. Walking forward a little bit she unceremoniously sat on the bench, carefully setting the tablet down next to her. \"I'm so fucking screwed.\" She muttered to herself. \"Sleeping with your boss? Yeah, I would say so.\" An unfamiliar voice said from behind her. Shrieking, she stood up, spinning around only to come face to face with Cute Phone Guy. She met Stuart! Well, kind of. Reviews are loved. -ARF[Chapter 3] Another update because like all of you I was excited! Thanks everyone who reviewed you guys are AWESOME! SPOILER ALERT: You get to see what's going on in Stuart's head. Disclaimer: I do not own and never will. She choked as his words registered in head. \"I-I'm sorry?\" Because no, he couldn't have actually said that to her, insinuating that she would sleep her way around. \"You heard me. That how you got your job here? Slept with him and he took an interest. Probably wanted you around for convenience.\" Cute Phone Guy profiled. She now had to make a new name for him. Asshole seemed like a good one. Or Dick. \"You don't know anything about me.\" She retorted and she paled slightly at the disgusted smirk that appeared. \"But you didn't deny it.\" He pointed out. She huffed grabbing her tablet before stalking towards him. \"You probably wouldn't have believed me otherwise.\" She snapped at him. She turned the screen so that he could see it. He gave it a glance before returning his eyes back to her. She sucked in a breath at the whiskey color. \"It's a formatting code, so?\" \"For the Play Store as known as the department I work in. I worked my ass off to get where I am. I graduated from Cornell with a double major in Computer Science and Digital Arts, Graphics and Animation! I was second in my class. I interned here at 17 and I'm going on my third year. I love my job and I wouldn't do something as stupid and demeaning as sleep with my pig of a boss to jeopardize that.\" She snarled at him. He merely blinked at her, unmoved at what she told him. She hated this guy. \"So?\" \"So, that means how about you go to your seminars and leave the employees to do their work? Got it, intern?\" She sneered the title at him before pushing past him. Dick seemed like a very appropriate name. Her hurried and pounding steps and the fierce scowl on her face had anyone moving out of her way as she made her way where Lyle was meeting her for lunch. \"Ms. Spaulding! If I may have a word?\" The familiar voice of Chetty filled her ears, making her pause. She took a deep and hopefully calming breath before turning around. \"Is everything alright Ms. Spaulding?\" He asked with slight concern. She cleared her throat before speaking. \"Yes, of course. I was just,\" her blue eyes caught sight of Dick over Chetty's shoulder. She watched him warily as he read something on his phone before glancing up. He caught sight of her, giving her a small smirk. Gritting her teeth as he started walked towards them; she pushed forward in her explanation, \"getting annoyed with the programming that a first year screwed up.\" She informed Chetty just as Dick walked by. \"Yes, well please be more relaxed. We don't want you to visit the hospital again so soon.\" She actually full body winced at his words as Dick passed them. She noticed out of the corner of her eye, that his steps faltered. \"I promise I'll control my annoyance and stress, Chetty.\" She informed him with a small, grateful smile. \"Besides Lyle would kill me if stressed myself more than I should.\" \"He is only worried about you, Maya.\" The use of her first name surprised at her, but she didn't let it show as she gave him a humorless smile. \"So I've been told. Now, if you would excuse me, I'm actually meeting Lyle for lunch and he's probably wondering where I am.\" \"Actually, I spoke to him before the meeting was over and informed him that I could use your help with one of the seminars I am holding.\" She was able to catch the flinch before it became noticeable to Dick, who was still standing a few feet away from them. \"Of-of course. As long as it's alright with Mr. Parsons.\" \"He said that I could use you for a few hours.\" She closed her eyes at his wording. \"Gr-great. Which seminar did you want help with?\" \"Workplace.\" She blanched because of course it would be that one when she was just accused of doing something inappropriate in the workplace. \"I'll meet you there, Chetty.\" She managed to get out. \"Wonderful. Room 186.\" She didn't say anything as she stared out in front of her. \"Not a fucking word, Dick.\" She snapped at the boy before marching in the opposite direction to take the long way. She didn't even notice that he never took his eyes off of her. She stood next to Chetty, tablet in hand as she told him about the project she was currently working on for Mr. Parsons. \"Is that what you were working on during orientation?\" He asked lightly as the Noogler's entered the room. \"Yeah, a first year screwed up the code for the formatting and coloring. I haven't caught anything else, but it's too soon to tell. After this last seminar I have to go to my office and check it out, but I'm confident that it was just a mixture of a lack of sleep and human error.\" She told him as her eyes roamed over the interns. Her eyes just landed on Dick when Chetty spoke, \"Just don't scare the poor boy.\" He whispered to her with a small amused smile. Surprised at the correct assumption, she threw her head back and laughed. \"I'll try not to, but I make no promises.\" She said between giggles. She suddenly felt two distinct pair of eyes on her. Looking over, she spotted Kiss Ass staring at her eagerly making her sneer at him at him when Chetty wasn't looking. She wasn't surprised to see the Dick was the other one watching her. Her blue eyes locked onto his whisky. Whatever disdain he had for her earlier was mostly gone, just over powered with a sense of curiosity like he wanted to figure her out. No, she shook her head slightly as she moved off to the side, like he wanted to figure out why he was interested, she amended. She knew his type, head always in the codes, computer and phone always on hand, never admiring the beauty around them. It was a sad and lonely life for a twenty-one year old. She placed her tablet in her bag before placing it carefully it in one of the empty chairs in the front row. \"Now I recognize that Google is not a conventional workplace.\" She coughed covering a laugh at Chetty's words. Smiling and waving innocently at him when he shot her an amused glance causing the interns to laugh. \"This having said that we have rules. My colleague Maya,\" he waved a hand towards her where every intern stared at her, \"and myself are going to ask you a series of questions. You're going to raise the green paddle to indicate yes and the red for no. So, let's begin.\" Chetty pressed clicker in his hand and the screen changed. \"Having a beer with your boss.\" Almost everyone in the room raised a red paddle. She wasn't surprised when the two older interns raised the green ones. \"Some of you are under twenty-one.\" Chetty said to the group, but his eyes were on the two. \"Some of us aren't under twenty-one. So, if you want to grab a cold one with me, I would be happy to do that with you.\" The tall dark haired one said. She watched in growing amusement as Chetty shot the invitation down. \"You get high?\" She choked down her surprised laugh at the question. \"I don't get high.\" Chetty denied. \"Okay.\" The intern shrugged, \"I'm not judging. I'm just saying people do it.\" She watched as he leaned forward to quietly talk to Dick. She watched with slight interest. Dick never even looked at the older man once, keeping his eyes on the screen before him as he shook his head. She turned back to focus on Chetty as he nodded to her, clicking the remote where the screen changed. \"Dating a fellow intern.\" Her voice was soft, but full of meaning as she carefully watched them. She knew suddenly knew why Chetty had help with this seminar, especially as Kiss Ass eyes were still on her. He wanted to see what interns would be tempted. Oh well play Chetty. Well played. Get the pretty girl to say this rule in a room full of males, who most probably never even talked to a girl that wasn't their mother or teacher, she thought in humor. She thought she should be annoyed, but really it made sense to some weird degree. Once again, every paddle with the exception of the two older ones held up the red. Though she did notice that both Kiss Ass and Dick had tightened their hands on the green. She looked on curiously at Dick, somehow surprised at the small reaction, but he refused to look in her direction. \"Unfortunately this is Google.\" She told them as the screen showed the red paddle. \"Not Match dot com.\" The blond spoke up, \"Excuse me, what about a full time employee. Say management level, but not a direct supervisor. Great eyes and a severity that is surprisingly sexy.\" She blinked at him, not know if he was serious or joking, before turning to Chetty. \"I'm going to let you handle this, kay? Okay.\" She said as she stepped back. Maya watched blankly as Chetty continued to shoot down anything the two said. She didn't know why he was being so hard on them as she did know that he identified with them. Somehow, she thought that he was secretly hoping for them to succeed in the program. She mentally rolled her eyes as the screen once again changed. It would be like Chetty to bring hell down on some intern or employee that he saw potential in. She leaned back against the wall keeping her eyes on the interns as the words became background noise. Stuart couldn't figure it out. He hated the feeling as it was something that he wasn't familiar with. Codes, data, concrete logic that's what he knew, what he was familiar with. He wasn't a people person or a team player; human contact and feelings were completely foreign to him that his parents often worried. So, for the life of him he couldn't figure it out why this girl wouldn't leave him alone and why it was bugging him so much. He first noticed her at orientation. He had felt eyes on him and when he looked over he was surprised to see a beautiful girl, who looked around his age, staring at him. He could tell from this distance that her eyes were blue. Her hair was a honey color and fell in soft waves around her shoulder. Her skin had a little color to it, but it looked smooth and soft. She was wearing a lime green tank top with a short sleeve dark blue t-shirt over it. Her jeans were faded with a hole on her thigh and small tears here and there. She was wearing black Converses. Her clothing clung to her like a second skin showing off her curves. He noticed the ID badge that was clipped to her shirts and he was curious if she was an actual employee or was just visiting. She had shot him a smirk before returning to the tablet on hand. He made himself focus on Chetty, but every so often he would glance at the girl. When the orientation was over, he left the room, but had to turn around as he had forgotten his beanie. He had spotted her talking to someone he assumed was her boss as she pointed to her tablet, hearing her speak about formatting and codes. As he quietly made his way down the stairs he heard the man ask her to lunch. Even he could hear the suggestive tone the older man used. He was however surprised at the annoyance he felt and the relief of her declining. He really didn't know what happened next as he watched her sit on one of the benches. And when she spoke to herself, he couldn't stop the words from coming even if he didn't know where they were coming from. She had obviously been surprised at his words, most likely thinking she was alone. He wasn't sure why, but he was surprised that she had fought back. But the more she spoke, the more he learned about her and the more he was intrigued by the beautiful girl. Her name was Maya. She went to Cornell University and double majored in Computer Science and Digital Arts, Graphics and Animation. She was second in her class. She had done the internship when she was 17 and she's now a third year employee working in the Google Play department. She was apparently close to someone name Lyle and that she was recently in the hospital. She called him Dick. She made his pulse race. He wanted to figure her out. And he hated that. I was having some issue on the whole how long she's been there thing until I figure that when she interned it wasn't really her first year as a paid employee. So, she's been with Google since she was 18, working over the summer on vacations, while still attending school in New York. Anyways, I know Stuart seems a little out of character, but I'm going with the fact that even though he has zero experience of any kind with people let alone females, he can still appreciate the beauty of a girl, especially one that seems to grab his attention away from computers because lets face it: He's a 21 year old male, he's going think with his dick occasionally. Reviews are loved. -ARF[Chapter 4] I'm glad that you all liked seeing what was going on in Stuart's head. SPOILER ALERT: Maya meets the team and not everyone is impressed. P.S. Like what I did with the chapter titles? Disclaimer: I don't own. Never will. Next Day She was just curious on who Lyle was going to end up with for his team. At least that's what she was telling herself and a part of her knew she was telling the truth. She was absolutely proud of her brother for how far he had come. She knew that he was nervous and worried that he wouldn't get a team or that his team wouldn't like him, but she had faith he could do this. The other part was curious as to what mentor Dick would choose. She watched as the interns talked quietly between themselves as she snuck up behind the couch where her brother was sitting. \"Hey.\" She greeted softly making him jump in his seat. \"Maya!\" He nearly yelled, but she quieted him down as her eyes flickered around the room to see if anyone had noticed. Only one intern was paying any attention to her. He was eyeing her and Lyle and she realized at what the picture seemed to the interns. She was leaning over the back of the couch; her face was about six inches away from Lyle's. She knew that her normally distant expression was warm and open as it usually was when she was in her older brother's comforting presences. She wondered what he thought he was seeing. \"Maya?\" Her brother's voice brought her back to reality. Tearing her eyes away so she wasn't drowning in whiskey, she looked into the comforting brown of Lyle. \"So, are we nervous or excited?\" She asked him teasingly, brushing off the small stare down even if she could still feel his gaze on her. \"Both while also scared shitless.\" He admitted quietly. Her eyes softened as her brother fidgeted. \"You're going to be a great team manager, Lyle.\" She told him seriously. She didn't know if he believed her or not, but he smiled at her gratefully pressing a quick kiss to forehead. \"You're the best sister ever, you know that.\" She rolled her eyes at him with an amused grin on her face. \"Helps I'm your only sister, but yeah I know.\" She pressed her own kiss to his temple. \"Text me when you get your team. I'm going to want to meet them. See if they're good enough for my big brother.\" He nodded and she straighten up to stand, eyes clashing with Dick once more. He was frowning which wasn't that surprising as whenever they had seen each other in the past twenty-four hours, he was either smirking or frowning at her. His brow was furrowed and his eyes were intense. Shaking off the weirdness, she left the room, hoping against hope that Lyle wouldn't get stuck with the leftovers. She had lost herself in fixing the formatting issue that she had pushed off yesterday when she received that text. Clicking on the Hangout icon, her past conversation with Lyle appeared with new a message. We're in our shared office. Room 237C. She couldn't really determine anything from the words, so she had no way of knowing on how he was feeling. Be there in five. Just as she hit send, she stood up, tablet in hand, ID badge connected to the brown vest she was wearing over a white short-sleeve shirt. She was wearing a white flowing skirt and a pair of light brown leather heeled boots. She walked out her office; her head already back to her tablet. Entering the elevator, her mind wandered to who Lyle's team consisted of. One thing was for sure, she hoped that British guy who had hit on her yesterday wasn't on it. Speak of the devil, she thought as the elevator opened revealing Kiss Ass. She kept her eyes on her tablet as he and five others walked in behind him. \"Hey Maya.\" She looked up to see Jason smiling at her. \"Jason hey! What's going on?\" She asked with a grin, ignoring the way Kiss Ass was leering at her. \"Having a team meeting. You?\" \"I'm about to meet Lyle's team.\" She noticed the way Jason seemed to grimace in sympathy. \"Oh god, don't tell me…\" She trailed off. \"He's probably mentally freaking out. He's going to need you to calm him down.\" \"My brother's an anxious idiot.\" She muttered to herself as the doors opened again. She stepped out and they followed her heading to their own office. She could see her brother standing in front of his team. Taking a quick glance at them, her heart sunk at the sight of the two older interns. Jesus Lyle, she thought to herself before her eyes landed on a Japanese boy, who just screamed a lack of social skill and an Indian girl. She furrowed her brows, wondering if she missed counted or if Lyle somehow got the short end of the stick and only got four. It has been known to happen on an occasion. \"Excuse me, Maya was it?\" The annoying British boy asked. Clenching her jaw, she turned to face him. He was alone, the rest of his team having already entered their shared office space down the hall from Lyle's. \"What?\" She responded sharply, wanting to get away from him as fast as she could. \"I just realize that I never introduced myself. My name in Graham Hawtrey.\" He held out his hand for her to shake. She gave it disdainful look before meeting his eyes. \"I don't care.\" \"You should. We're going to be co-worker by the end of the summer.\" His confidence was irritating and she wanted to wipe the smug smirk off his face. \"Summer just began. A lot of things can happen between now and then.\" She informed him. \"Like getting you to fall in love with me?\" He asked her charmingly and had she not found him completely full of bullshit, she would have fallen for it. She turned away from him. \"It's good to have dreams. Even if it's impossible.\" She said over her shoulder as she walked to the door to Lyle's office. \"It's going to happen. By the end of the summer you'll be in love.\" He called out to her. She scowled at him. \"But not with you.\" With that she opened the door roughly and barged in. All eyes were on her as the door slammed shut behind her. She tensed, hearing Graham chuckle through the glass doors and made sure to throw a glare at him as he walked to where his team was station. \"Uh-Maya?\" Lyle called out cautiously. Eyes shot to his as they flashed angrily. \"I'm going to kill that guy.\" Her brother pinched the bridge of his nose, \"You're not killing anyone.\" \"You can't stop me.\" She said defiantly as she crossed her arms over her chest, holding the tablet close to her. \"No, but do you really want to hear it from mom?\" It was a low blow and they both knew it. She glared at him for a small moment, \"I hate you.\" He shook his head with a grin, \"No you don't.\" \"Whatever.\" \"I'm sorry, but who are you?\" An annoyed feminine voice asked. Glancing up, she spotted the culprit standing off to the side arms crossed under chest as she eyed her condescendingly. She held in her snappy retort and gave her a mocking smile, not at all surprised that she was trying to assert herself with the guys, hoping to make them realize she was the one girl that matter at this time. \"A third year Googler.\" She told the girl sharply making her squirm. \"Her name's Maya.\" A voice cut in. Her blue eyes shot to the couch where the familiar face of Dick was lounging. It was strange that her heart skipped a beat at the sight of him. Lyle's eyes narrowed as they flickered between the two of them. \"You two know each other?\" \"We met in passing.\" She said lightly, daring Dick to say something to contradict her. \"She was also working with Chetty in the Workplace Seminar.\" Dick told the group as he slowly looked up her up and down. However, unlike with Graham, who made her skin crawl, his gaze was making her blood warm and skin prickle. She needed get outside more to cool off as the heater seemed to on today. \"Lyle why don't you introduce me to your team?\" She suggested wanting to get away from the heady feeling that muddling her brain from his stare. She made sure to pay close attention to the names. The girl who gave attitude was Neha Patel. The quite Japanese kid was Yo-Yo Santos. The tall dark haired was Billy McMahon, the first half of the charity case. The blond was Nick Campbell, the second half. And finally that just left Dick, also known as, Stuart Twombly. Stuart, she said the name in her head. I like it. \"Guys this Maya. My sister.\" She wished she had a camera to capture the looks on Neha and Stuart's faces. It was priceless. They officially met! Ah, but their road is going to rough to be get through. Chapters are going to be longer after this one and getting somewhat more darker as we learn more about Maya's past. Reviews are loved. -ARF[Chapter 5] Because I'm feeling generous and in a good mood for finishing up two more chapters, I'm posting a second chapter today. Thanks for everyone who continuing to support this story and me. You guys are the best! SPOILER ALERT: Mr. Kiss Ass himself gives us his thoughts on Maya and the first challenge from her point view is up! Disclaimer: I do not own. Sister. The pretty girl that had somehow sunk up on him was his team manager's sister. Of course she would be, he thought bitterly, the first person I show an actual interest in and she's off limits. He shook those thoughts away from the dangerous territory they were heading. This day couldn't get any better, he decided sarcastically as he looked at his team. Neha and Yo-Yo seemed competent enough in their skills. Lyle obviously knew what the fuck he was doing, even if he wanted to punch him every time he spoke in the third person. It was two bumbling, overgrown idiots that him saying goodbye to whatever hope he had of working here. He had to wonder why they were even allowed in the program in the first place. Stuart glanced up from his phone, eyes finding Maya again. He had noticed her as soon as she came storming in with her honey hair in a low ponytail over her shoulder, her blue eyes searing with anger and disgust, and a scowl painted on shining lips as she talked about killing one of the interns. The skirt she was wearing had whipped around her thighs before settling down calmly when she stood next to Lyle, the hem ending a couple inches above her knees. He had swallowed at the sight of all her creamy skin. Why did his hormones have to come out now? He shook his head again, ignoring the voice in his head that was talking. You're a healthy twenty-one year old male and she's a beautiful twenty-one year old female. It's natural. The voice sounded a lot like his dad. Going back to his phone where everything made sense, he let the other's talking become enough background noise where he could still catch what they were saying, but still completely ignore them too. \"A third year Googler? How old are you?\" He heard Billy ask. \"21. I did the internship program when I was 17.\" \"When you were still in high school?\" It was Nick this time talking. \"I graduated high school just a little after my sixteenth birthday. I went to Cornell on a full academic scholarship after.\" \"Wow. Is everyone in your family super smart?\" Nick asked causing Maya to laugh lightly. He ignored the way his hands tensed around his phone. \"I mean I guess, but I never really noticed.\" She told them. \"Mia, was it?\" Neha's question had him looking up and eyed her cautiously before sparing a glanced at the other girl. Her smile was tight and slightly condescending like she knew that Neha was doing this to get under her skin, but wasn't having any success in doing so. \"It's Maya.\" She corrected blandly. \"Whatever. So, where do you work?\" \"In Play.\" He already knew this of course, but it was still impressive. \"I'm one of the top programmers for them.\" That he didn't know. \"Now if you would excuse me, I should get back to work.\" She told them. \"It was nice meeting you guys. Lyle, text me if you won't be home tonight.\" Lyle nodded and then everyone was saying bye to her. She paused before opening the door and looked over her shoulder with an amused spark in her eyes. \"Bye Dick.\" She was looking right at him with a small grin. She walked of the office before anyone could say anything, leaving him to stare blankly at the doors. He felt someone nudge his knee; turning wide eyes to Nick, he was irritated to see the smug smirk the idiot was wearing. \"Looks like the pretty girl likes Stuart here.\" The older man said teasingly causing Stuart to scowl at him. \"No. No. My sister doesn't like anyone. At all. Ever.\" Lyle denied. It was kind of humorous to see the guy act like his younger sister didn't know that boys existed. \"Lyle, my man. Maya's a beautiful, healthy young woman.\" Billy informed him and Stuart was curious as to why Lyle flinched at the mention of 'healthy'. \"Trust me your sister likes guys and from the way she couldn't stop staring at him, she has her eye on Stuart.\" His heart did not start to race. It didn't. \"Just let me pretend that she's still eight years old and the only boys that don't have cooties are me and our dad.\" Lyle begged and he ended up taking pity on the guy. \"Relax, she hates me. Every time we saw each other we got into an argument. It's why she calls me Dick.\" He said emotionlessly as he went back to his phone. \"Right. Well our translate lecture is in fifteen minutes.\" Lyle told them after an awkward silence. \"Let's go Team Lyle.\" Pause. \"No? Okay, we'll work on it. It's in beta. Let's go.\" This summer is going to suck ass, Stuart thought as he followed them out. Few Days Later He spotted her in the café. The ever present tablet in hand, a beverage that she would occasionally drink out of, and ear buds in place that connected to a silver iPod classic that was resting on the table, next to a notebook and a pen. He watched as her pointer finger tapped against the edge of her tablet, mimicking the beat to whatever song she was listening too. Every so often she would set the tablet down, and grab the pen, quickly writing something out. When he first saw her at orientation, he figured that he could convince her to on his team, mainly because of her appearance and thought maybe he could sleep with her too. It through his plans off a bit when she informed that she was an actual employee. Even more so when he learned that her brother worked here as well and was a team manager. No matter, he thought determinedly, I always get what I want. He started to make his way towards her when she began packing her things in her bag, tablet included. She stood up, stretching before slinging the bag over her shoulder and grabbed her beverage cup. He followed her as she walked out of the building, tossing the cup in a nearby trashcan. He was assuming that she was heading home for the day as it was nearing 6:30, but someone had called out her name making her pause and turned to face the culprit. It was the kid in the beanie; the one who had to deal with the two old interns. Stan or something, he thought vaguely. He watched as they talked, things becoming heated, though they weren't yelling at each other. She poked his chest roughly as she spoke to him and he glared to down at her with a clenched jaw. Narrowing his eyes at the pair, he wondered what they could be arguing about. She spun away from the kid, quickly leaving him by himself as he glared in her direction. He muttered a string of curse words before turning around and heading to the intern apartments. Something was going on there, but it never stopped him before because like he said before: Graham Hawtrey always got what he wanted. Earlier that Day First Challenge Chetty had asked for her help again. He wanted her to keep an eye on what was happening during the first challenge. She tried to tell him no, that she had too much work to do and that she was biased with her brother and all, but he told her that he faith that she could keep her emotions out of the competition. She wasn't so sure of that as she walked past Lyle's team, riveted in the way Stuart was focusing on the board in front of him. Why? Why was she captivated by this guy? Their very first meeting he accused her of sleeping her way into her job and up the ladder basically degrading her and calling her intelligence into question. She hated when people did that. One doesn't get into Cornell University at 16 just because they were pretty. Besides, she wouldn't something as stupid as sleep with her boss. She would never jeopardize her career. She owed Google her life. Literally. She hated this guy and everything that he stood for. Oh, there was no denying that he was smart. He was valedictorian at his high school, graduating with honors; a full ride scholarship to MIT where he was in the top 5 percentile of his class. Lyle had even told her that he was getting offers from Apple and Samsung, but that he really wanted to be at Google. But he had an attitude that rivaled her ex-boyfriend from college and focused way too much on his phone and not the world around him. He belittled everything anyone said and judged someone with just a look. She hated people like that and yet… There was something about him that had her pausing and looking at him differently. He was attractive with his tall frame. He wasn't overly fit with bulging muscles, but they were lean and there. His chocolate brown hair was always covered in the stupid beanie, but she imagined it would be spiked. He was always wearing some kind of smirk on his full lips. But it was his eyes, those searing whiskey colored eyes that burned through her whenever they connected with hers. She always had a thing for whiskey. She turned her attention to the other groups, glancing over at Lyle's every so often. It was when Neha stood up and yelled at Nick and Billy that she walked over to them and quietly slipped into the office. She raised an eyebrow at Lyle, who shook his head wanting to see how this would play out. \"…but you're not helping. You're saying a lot of words really fast that mean nothing.\" She told them seriously. \"To find the bug, we need to scan the user logs and find the code until we find the programmer's mistake. It's the only way.\" \"Except what if it's not the only way?\" Billy interjected. \"Okay, you said that someone programmed it. That means that some person in this building wrote that code.\" He had a point, but she knew that it wasn't going to help them debug it. Curious on what code they were using, she silently made her way to one of the screens, eyes scanning the familiar audio program. A very familiar audio program. Well damn, she thought flattered at the sight, they're fixing my code. Wait! My code doesn't need fixing especially not this one! It was kind of insulting that they ruined her code. She forced herself to listen to Billy talk about someone name Tony and kayaking and throwing a few beers around. She made sure not to say anything about any of this. \"Yeah, actually I think that's a great idea.\" Stuart's voice cut in suddenly. She raised an eyebrow at him, somehow not liking the expression on his face. \"Dark and stormy feeling us!\" \"Yeah, no feeling ya big time buddy.\" He paused as Billy and Nick got excited over someone agree with them. \"You know what in fact why don't the two of you right now, go and find the programmer.\" Lyle shook his head and she wanted to smack him for not stopping this. \"Yo-Yo, who's our man?\" Nick asked. She watched as Yo-Yo spotted something over on one of the desks. \"His name is Charles Xavier.\" She tensed at the name, disapproving eyes on the boy. \"Uh-he's a professor. At Stanford.\" Neha added, making her press her mouth in a thin line. \"Yeah, just a few minutes away really.\" I am not here. I am not here. I'm just observing that it all. I can ream their asses later. \"Guys.\" Lyle tried to stop, but she knew that it wouldn't help anything. \"And he's in a wheelchair.\" \"Got it Stanford. Wheelchair. What else?\" \"Oh he's bald.\" \"He might be with his best friend who wears a metal helmet.\" The three interns kept throwing random X-Men trivia at them before Neha gave the last one. \"He has a British accent!\" Nick had decided that was more than enough information as he started out the door. \"Okay. Think fly. Think bug. I promise you this somehow intersects with Goldblum.\" Billy said before following Nick out. \"All right back to work guys.\" Neha's said softly as they turned back to the challenge. She watched in disgust as they went to work like they didn't just haze two-fifths of their team. \"Maya.\" Lyle said quietly as to not bring the other's attention to her. \"I got to say that was mighty impressive.\" She said loud enough for the interns to hear. She satisfied when they tensed at the sound of her voice before slowly turning to face her. \"They were getting in the way, Maya.\" Lyle tried to reason. She shot him a livid look. \"I'm well aware of that, but that gives you no reason to send them out on a wild goose chase, Lyle Marcus.\" She snapped at him. \"What are you even doing here?\" Neha asked, her fingers clenching the marker tightly as she shifted on her feet. \"Chetty wanted me to observe the teams.\" She told them, \"He wanted me see just how well everyone was working together in their teams.\" \"They're useless Maya.\" Stuart pointed out. It was the first time he addressed her by her first name and she scowled at the pause her heart made. \"Then you tell them that and don't get rid of them to find the programmer or the X-Men.\" She yelled, \"Especially not when the person who wrote the code is right here.\" She pointed to herself. She turned back to her brother, \"You and I will talk later.\" As she walked out, she reminded herself that she hated people like that. She didn't look at Lyle's team for the rest of the challenge. Graham is going to make a play at Maya soon even though, he can see something between her and Stuart and how do you think Stuart will react to that? And just what were Maya and Stuart arguing about? Also, Neha doesn't seem to impressed with Maya, what's her deal? Thoughts? Reviews are loved. -ARF[Chapter 6] I am loving the response I'm getting from everyone. You guys are the best! I'm so happy that you all love Maya as much as I do because not only if she kickass, but she's got a past that make her vulnerable and broken because at the end of the day that's what she is: broken, but trying to piece herself back together again. Disclaimer: I don't own. She refused to talk Lyle when she got home still fuming from her argument with Stuart. \" Maya!\" She heard someone call out. Turning around, she frowned when she spotted Stuart coming up to her. \" Mr. Twombly, what can I do for you?\" She bit out, hoping the formal tone would get him to leave her alone. He looked startled at the use of his last name. \"Mr. Twombly? Is that how it's going to be?\" He asked seriously. \" Yes, that is how it's going to be; especially if you're going to be petty and childish.\" She snapped at him. He sighed, stepping closer to her, \"That's what I came to talk to you about.\" He said quietly. She looked up at him with hard eyes, trying not to noticed that he towered over her as she only came up to his shoulders. It made her feel tiny. \" Oh please let me hear how you're going to justify your actions today.\" She said sarcastically. \" They don't know any of this stuff or anything technology related.\" He started and she understood that. She really did, but he just wasn't getting why she was so upset. He was just like the rest of them. She glared up at him, \"So that gives you the right to push them out? Make them feel even more like an outcast?\" She had four encounters with the guy and was getting attached with nothing to go on from his end. She knew nothing about him other than his academic record and that he was a dick. This soft spot had to go away; she couldn't the risk of it ruining her, because that's what would happen if she got attached. He would destroy her. He could destroy her. And she hated herself because she couldn't seem to stop trying to learn anything about him because she hasn't been this interested about a guy since college. And that had ended with her with an addiction and a bad heart. \" Look okay, I'll admit it was a dick move on our parts, but you weren't stopping us either!\" He pointed out. She poked him in the chest, \"Because I'm not a team manager. I'm not responsible for any of you. That's my brother's job. I've been task to oversee the challenges with an impassive eye and I'll gladly inform Chetty what happened today, but while he may not like them either, he doesn't want pompous asshole working for this company either.\" It was never going to happen. \" He's trusting you with that? Even with Lyle?\" \" Yes, he is, but I'll step down and put my support in Graham's\" She spat the name out like it was dirt, \"team.\" He stared down at her with narrowed eyes, \"You wouldn't.\" She stepped closer; her breasts lightly brushed against his chest causing him to tense and clench his hands into fists and for her to nearly tremble. \"Try me.\" She whispered softly before turning away. She didn't relax until she couldn't feel his eyes on her anymore. She wasn't going to him destroy her. She walked right past Lyle, who was nervously standing in the kitchen, and headed to her room. \"Maya! Let me explain please!\" He begged as he followed her. She didn't say anything. \"Come on Maya! Don't be like this.\" Nothing. \"Maya. Look I'm sorry, but what was I supposed to do?\" He asked and his dejected tone made her snap. She whipped around, glaring at him. \"Be a team manager! You are responsible for those kids and Nick and Billy.\" She spat at him causing him to flinch, but she didn't back down. \" You are supposed to make them come together as a team because how else are they going to work here if they manage to get the jobs?\" She asked rhetorically. \"You know that Google is more than just technology and apps and updates. It's about bringing people together in the easiest of ways.\" His shoulders slumped and his head fell forward in defeat. She softened at the sight and her next words as she stepped forward placing a hand on his shoulder. \"I get that this isn't fair to you having not only the leftovers, but getting Nick and Billy too, but you can't just let the others act childish like that. I'll tell you what I told Stuart,\" He looked startled at the news, but he could open his mouth to say anything she continued, \"I'll gladly inform Chetty on happened today because I don't want to be working with those kinds of people and last time I checked neither did you.\" She pointed out softly. He nodded, understanding what she was saying. \"Lyle your my brother and I love you, but what happened today,\" she shook her head, \"I didn't even recognize you and I didn't like what I saw.\" \"I know and I'm sorry.\" He said, but she shook her head again. \"It's not me you owe an apology too.\" He closed his eyes, \"You're right. I'll talk to them tomorrow.\" \"Good.\" Lyle looked at her then with a thoughtful expression. \"You talked to Stuart about what happened?\" He asked curiously making her tense as the argument came to mind once more. \"He tried to justify his actions to me when I was heading home.\" She told him in a clipped tone. \"You don't like him very much do you?\" She raised an eyebrow at him. \"He accused me of sleeping my away into a job when we first met.\" \" He did what?\" He shouted, making her roll her eyes at him. \"Relax, I set him straight.\" She said dismissively though Stuart's words still stung a little. \"How can you expect me to relax, Maya? I have to mentor this guy and he insulted you. You know I don't stand for that.\" Lyle stated seriously. She sighed, her irritation with the whole day, blowing over. \"And it's over and done with. It was the first and only time it happened. Any other time I dealt with him he was usually dickish self. It's fine and I'm over it.\" He snorted, not believing her. \"You had your intelligence insulted and you hate that, but even more so I know what working at Google means to you and how much it helped with your recovery. And you're just going to let it go for him. Why?\" \"Because-\" She paused, thinking it over, \"I don't know.\" Lyle stared at her for a moment. \"You like him.\" \"I- what?\" She laughed at the statement. \"I don't even know him, Lyle. How the hell can I like him?\" \"Because you're not destroying his life for insulting your intelligence.\" \"Maybe I'm just turning over a new leaf.\" She suggested with a shrug. \"You know not taking anything seriously and all that.\" \"Bullshit.\" \"Oh god, whatever. I don't like Stuart.\" \"I don't believe you.\" \"Fine. Would you like me tell you what I think of him, Lyle?\" She asked as an idea came to mind. It was the only way to get him off her back. \"He's hot.\" \"Hot?\" She nodded, \"Yeah. You know extremely attractive? I'd like to take him home and rip that ridiculous beanie off his head and fuck him for hours at end.\" She said with such a straight face she wondered for a minute if there was some truth to her words. No! She told herself, I will not go there. \" Maya!\" He shouted in disgust as he slammed his eyes shut to rid himself of her words. She shrugged innocently, \"What? You asked.\" \"I hate you.\" She grinned, \"Love you too.\" She turned around walked to her room with a skip her step, feeling much better now that she talked to Lyle. When she fell asleep later that night, she dreamed of burning whiskey and a beanie on the ground. Maya was Marielena's best friend. She also knew that Maya viewed her as something as close to a sister as well. Marielena was Maya's first stepping stone to a better life than the one she had been living. She first met Maya when the younger girl was had just turned seventeen. Lyle was going on his second year with Google, but had taken some personal time, claiming a family emergency. He had been back for about a of couple weeks when Maya stopped by. Marielena was in the café when she spotted the girl, who was nervously shifting on her feet, arms wrapped tightly around her, flinching whenever someone got to close to her. She took in the pale skin, the deep bruising under her eyes, the baggy clothing that hid her frame and the skittish expression. This girl was in survival mode. Or was at least trying to get there. Her heart went out to the girl; she knew the signs of someone slipping up. She knew that the smallest of things could trigger the biggest consequences. With her second job at the club, she had friends who got hooked on whatever was around at the time. Heroine, meth, ecstasy, the list goes on. Cocaine was a popular one too. Before she knew what she was doing, she was slowly making her way to her. She made sure that she was seen when she approached, noticing the stiffness in her shoulders when she greeted her. \" Hello.\" She greeted softly, kindly as though she was speaking to a terrified child. The girl gave a jerky nod. \" Are you here for someone?\" She asked, not put off by the lack of words. She nodded again. \" Do you need some help finding them?\" The girl paused her movements, chewing on her lip as she contemplated the question and her blue eyes that seemed to dull, a shadow of the girl she used to be, stared down at the ground before nodding again. Marielena had smiled gently at her even if she didn't see it. \"Okay then. Why don't you tell me who we're looking for?\" \" M-my br-brother.\" Her voice was soft as she tripped over her words. \" And what's his name?\" \" L-Lyle S-Spaulding.\" She tried to picture who the girl was talking about, no one came to mind. It wasn't unusual as she didn't know everyone in the company. \" Okay. Why don't we head to reception?\" She suggested, pointing over to the long desk. She moved to stand next to her, making sure not to touch her as she didn't want to scare her off. The girl didn't say anything as they slowly walked to the reception desk. \" What's your name?\" Marielena asked quietly. The girl glanced at her, but didn't answer. \" My name's Marielena.\" Still nothing, but she wasn't all that surprised. \" Hey Gwen?\" She called out to the receptionist, who looked up, eyes flickering between the two of them before they landed on the girl. \" Yes?\" \" Lyle Spaulding's sister is here to see him. Do you know where we could find him?\" She asked, hoping to get the attention away from the tense young woman next to her. Gwen was eyeing the girl distrustfully and didn't speak for a moment. The girl started to fidget nervously, chewing on her lip again as her eyes stayed on the ground. \" Gwen.\" Marielena said sharply causing the girl to flinch and step back, but she seemed to realize that the irritation wasn't towards her. \"Will you please tell us where Lyle is?\" She asked, her voice dripping with forced politeness. The woman nodded, still giving the girl the stink eye, as she went to her computer. The tense silence had both of them on edge, but she couldn't do anything to help without scaring the poor girl. \" He's up in Search. Here's a visitor's badge for Ms. Spaulding.\" Gwen said dubiously as though the girl was lying about her relation to Lyle. Marielena took the badge from her and gave her a fake smile. \" Thank you so much for your help.\" She said sarcastically before turning her back to her. She softened her tone and posture, \"Let's go see your brother, yeah?\" She asked with a small smile that the girl returned politely. When they were in the elevator, the girl pushed herself in the corner, arms no longer wrapped around her, but hanging at her sides, her fingers tapping against the leg. \" T-thank y-you.\" She said quietly, the relief and gratitude thick in her tone. Marielena shook her head, \"It's not a problem. I never like Gwen anyways. She needs to get laid more so the stick up her ass isn't so pronounced. The laugh that came out of her startled them both, but Marielena was happy to hear it. It was hearty and infectious and brightened her face, sparking her eyes with some life. But she could tell that she hadn't laughed like that in a long time and she wondered what her story was. The doors slid opened and they walked out coming to face a series of desks that were filled with computers. People were scattered about either working, talking to people, or on their way somewhere else. Marielena stopped someone as the past asking if they knew where Lyle Spaulding was. Following where they were pointing, she spotted a shaggy coffee brown head facing a computer screen. After thanking them, she and the girl headed the way. She noticed the way the girl started to perk up, life shining in her blue eyes at the sight of her brother. The girl stood a little straighter and her pace quicken slightly wanting to see him. \" Lyle!\" The girl called out with a stronger voice then the one she had been hearing. The boy jumped, having not expected the noise, as he turned around. He was cute in that geeky way, Marielena noted. He had dark brown eyes that hid behind a pair of thick rimmed glasses. He was wearing an MIT t-shirt and jeans. He was on the pale side and when he stood up, he only appeared to be a few inches taller than her. His eyes widen at the sight of the girl, who rushed towards him. \" Is everything all right? Did something happen?\" He asked worriedly as he met her halfway, hands coming to rest on her arms, looking her over for injuries before he stared into her eyes searching for something. The girl shrugged, suddenly embarrassed for having disturbed him. \" It was a bad day.\" She mumbled eyes on her hands in front of her. He sighed, his whole body screamed with exhaustion, but she noted that it was more in relief than anything else. Lyle pulled the girl to him, tucking her head under his chin, wrapping her up in his arms. The girl's own arms circled his waist squeezing him tightly as she burrowed her head into his collarbone. Marielena swallowed the 'aww' that wanted to come out. It was clear that Lyle loved his sister very much. \" I'm sorry for disrupting you. I just,\" The girl paused struggling to find her wording, \"needed to see you.\" He scoffed, arms tightening. \"You can stop by whenever you want, okay? All this.\" He removed one arm from her to wave it around him. \"Doesn't come before you and it never will. You are more important than anything. Do you understand?\" He asked her seriously. She didn't say anything, but nodded. \" Good and you know what? You came at the perfect time. I was just about to grab lunch.\" He told her happily. Marielena hid her smile, having spotted an empty take-out container in the garbage can next to his desk. \" That sound okay?\" \" Sounds great.\" He smiled down at her as they turned to the elevators, only to come to face her. She blushed lightly, suddenly realizing that she had eavesdropped on a private conversation. Lyle eyed her cautiously and she started apologizing. \"Uh-hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to listen it. I just brought her up because she was looking for you and the receptionist was a bitch. And I just wanted to make sure she got up here safely.\" He still looked a little distrustfully, even as his sister nodded in agreement. \"She was nice to me.\" She told her brother, glancing up at him. Her words softened his expression and he looked at her gratefully. \" Thank you.\" She shrugged, \"It was nothing.\" \" No.\" Something in his voice had her staring into his eyes that were suddenly burning with an intensity that surprised her. \"It was everything.\" \" Do you want to join us?\" His sister asked and Lyle wasn't the only one looking at her in shock. She shook her head, \"I wouldn't want to intrude.\" She denied, but Lyle was already shaking his own. \" It wouldn't be an intrusion at all. Besides, anyone who's nice to my sister is someone worth knowing.\" He said casually, but her breath suddenly seemed stuck in her throat. \" Please?\" His sister asked and the wide, hopeful look had her agreeing to lunch with the Spaulding siblings. It was when they were standing in the elevator, Lyle and Marielena on either side of the girl that she spoke again. \" My name's Maya.\" After that Marielena and Maya practically became inseparable. She was there when Maya was having good days and bad days, where the bad days seemed to borderline on just downright awful. She was there when Maya relapsed when even though she received the job at Google, pressure from her mom about her grades and her love life with the added stress of exams, got to be just too much. She was there when Maya moved out of her mother's home in New York to an apartment that she and Lyle would share. She was there when Maya received her one year chip and her two year chip and she would be there when she got her third year. So, when she noticed that Maya was squirming and fidgeting, she knew something was up. It might not be to the point where she had to talk to Lyle about a possible relapse, but she was worried that something had set her off towards that direction. She was also flipping her two year chip between her fingers. Maya only ever did that when something set her off balance and she didn't know how to regain it. Marielena hoped she would soon. So, there! Did anyone see that coming? I didn't want to come right out and say it and I didn't want it to come out Maya's mouth when it finally got said, so I figured why not her best friend? Very little Stuart/Maya interaction in this one, but we got some Lyle/Maya sibling feels because I absolutely adored them and we learned how Marielena and Maya met! Note: The next few chapters are going to get darker as we learn more about Maya's past and having to deal with her situation with her boss which is going to come to blows next chapter. Thoughts? Reviews are loved. -ARF P.S. I'm not going to be posting for a few days as I need to catch on some school work. I'll continue to work on the story, but I'm going to be complete FanFiction lock down till I'm done.[Chapter 7] I'm back! I've missed you all so much and I'm so happy to pull my head out of my history homework. Did you guys miss me? I totally bet you did. LOL. Again you are all awesome for reviewing. SPOILER ALERT: Parsons is a creep, Lyle adores his sister, there's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a revelation is made. Plus Neha=Bitch? Disclaimer: I do not own. Ever. She hasn't been to Lyle's office in a week. It was hard, but mostly strange. She never really noticed how much time she spent in her brother's office until she was actively avoiding it. Going there, being in his comforting presence soothed away the demons of her past and on a particularly bad day it reminded her that she was indeed loved and worth something to someone. It wasn't even that she was avoiding Lyle because she wasn't. Whatever her issues was with him had been cleared up, but it was that she didn't know how she would handle dealing with seeing Stuart after his awful attempt to explain his actions. She gave in after a really bad day. It was a little after two in the afternoon and her morning had been filled with meetings and some last minute touches to the new layout for the store. She had just finished giving a second year Googler the job of putting everything together, with the promise of letting her know when it was done, when Julian had asked her to come to his office. She tensed both from the invitation and from the sympathetic looks she was getting from her female co-workers, who had been on the receiving end of his unwanted flirtations. Stiffly entering his office, where the blinds were covering the glass walls, she eyed the man like he was about to attack at any moment. \"Come sit down Maya. Please.\" He said waving a hand towards one of the chairs in front of his glass desk. Cautiously, slowly she sat down and a knot twisted in her stomach when he sat in the other chair and not behind his desk. \"Was there a problem with the report on our progress Mr. Parsons?\" She asked, keeping her tone professional. He waved a hand dismissively, \"No. No. Everything looks good. In fact it would seem that you and your team are ahead of schedule.\" He noted the pride in his voice would be welcomed from anyone, but coming from him it made her skin itch unpleasantly. \"We've been working hard and only had a few minor hiccups.\" She said thinking back to the beginning of last week when the issue with formatting came up. Between the spare moments she had during orientation and the few hours the next day, she had been able to fix it fairly easily. \"Yes. I just wanted to tell you that you've been doing a wonderful job on this project and with your past ones as well.\" He praised. She smiled at him tightly, \"Thank you, but really it's been a team effort.\" He shook his head, leaning forward and placing a hand on her knee. She froze at the contact. \"You're modest.\" His thumb was rubbing small circles on the inside of her knee, but she couldn't move away. \"I'm honest.\" He laughed, squeezing her knee. \"Of course. Now, how about we celebrate with lunch? I know this wonderful Italian place just a few minutes from here and they make amazing lasagna and their wine selection is out of this world.\" He suggested. She cleared her throat, hoping her voice wasn't going to crack as she spoke, \"I'm sorry, but I don't think that would be appropriate.\" She watched as his face suddenly twisted in annoyance, the hand on her knee moving to grip her thigh tightly. She held in the gasp, thankful she decided to wear jeans today. \"You know, Maya, at first this playing hard to get was attractive, but now it's just getting annoying.\" He said harshly as he stood up. She breathed a small sigh of relief, but gasped audibly when he gripped her biceps and pulled her up to him, so that she was pressed up against him. \"I don't know what gave you the impression that I wanted something more from you, Mr. Parsons, but I can assure you that I was not playing hard to get.\" She spat out as she tried to remove herself from his hold. \"Don't lie now. I could tell from the way you dressed, those short skirts and the tight tops that showed your curves and your smooth skin. The breathy way you would say my name or the hooded look in your eyes.\" He whispered to in her ear. She shuddered in repulsion at the feel of his hot, moist breath on her skin. \"Get your hands off me.\" He tightened his grip and she just knew that bruises were going to be there by the end of the night. \"This is sexual harassment. I'll have you fired for this.\" She said and he only chuckled, his lips skimming up the column of her throat. Tears started to form behind her eyes, but she refused to let them fall. \"I'll just tell them that you came on to me. It'll be your word against mine and,\" he paused, pulling back as he gave her mocking sympathetic smile, \"who are they going believe? You-a third year employee that is easily replaceable- or me? The head of one of the biggest departments in Google.\" She didn't say anything, knowing that what he was saying was true. Who would believe her? \"Exactly.\" He breathed before slamming his mouth onto hers. She struggled; she fought like hell, pushing at his chest, trying to claw at him. He in turned just took and took and took, her fighting seemingly egging him on further. It wasn't until a flashback of her sophomore year came to her that she found a way to be free of him. Her arms were pushing against his chest, slapping and digging her nails into him. She needed to get away. She needed be back in the safety of her dorm or hell even at her childhood home, where her mother was. He tore the flimsy material of her top away from her torso, leaving her in her jeans and black bra. He roughly held her wrists above her head as he kissed his way down her throat. It was when he started fumbling with her belt that she reacted. She lifted a knee instinctively, hitting him right in the groin. He released her instantly, stepping away from as he covered himself hoping to ease the pain in any way. She blinked and she was back at Google and her boss was on the ground leaning heavily against one of the chairs as he curled himself in a ball. She didn't even think about it, rushing out of the office, passed her started co-workers, some of them calling out her name. She didn't know that a couple of them headed to their department head's office to see him covering himself as his face was covered in small scratches from her nails. She didn't bother waiting for the elevator, deciding to take the stairs to the one place where she knew she would be safe. Lyle's office. Maya wasn't the only one affected by the lack of contact at the office between them. She wasn't the only one who took comfort in the safety of his presence. He always took in the reassurance of her breathing or small chatter of random things or their bickering. He clung to them so tightly to reminded himself that she was there well and alive , with him. That she made it through one more day. Lyle knew that Maya still had some issues to work out even if she had been clean for two years; he knew that the memories from the time in her life still haunted her on occasion and that she was still fighting to survive and live her life. He could still remember the crippling fear he felt when he got the call that his sister was in the hospital from overdosing on a bad batch of cocaine. He never wanted to feel like that again. There was never a doubt in his mind, when he requested some time off, citing that it was a family emergency. They didn't question it, but they didn't like that he had been gone for so long. Three months. Three long, grueling, crying, screaming, curse filled months of watching his baby sister go through the harsh reality of rehab. The withdrawals to the point of sickness, the crying for their dad with no mention of their mother, screaming that she needed a hit just to make it through the day, and the cursing that she hated him for making her do this and that she would never forgive him and she wanted him to go away, go back to California, back to where he left her all alone with no one, but herself, a father, who loved them dearly, but was never there and mother, who never cared about anything more the appearances. And then she went one day with none of things happening and a second day. A third. And a fourth. And she was slowly piecing together those shatter parts that life had dealt her and he watched as his sister, the one person that he loved more than anything else in the world, become someone stronger. She became a survivor. There were days that were still bad, especially after she left rehab, where she came to visit him for the summer, hoping to get away from the demons. She attended meetings and was able to catch up in school online. He didn't know how many times he caught her staring a bag of white powder that she carried with her. She said she wanted to see if she could go without the temptation of it. He hated that he didn't believe her. The day she met Marielena she flushed it down the toilet and every day since then, he thanked god for bringing her into his sister's life. When she interviewed for the internship at Google, he was both proud and wary when she told them point blank that she was a recovering drug addict, but that coding and programming helped her keep her mind focus and off the drugs and that she had been four months clean. It was after that he met Robert Chetty. The older man was obvious in his reluctance in accepting his sister into the program, but he still took Lyle out to lunch and asked what he thought. \" Mr. Spaulding, do you think that it would a smart idea to let your sister, recovering drug addict, into a program?\" The man asked as he casually took a sip of his water. While he was nervous being in the presence of the man, he stared him right in the eye, defending his sister. \"I'm not going to lie to you, sir. My sister had made mistakes in her life, but she's trying to ratify that. After she overdosed, she went to rehab and the court ordered her there only for a month, she stayed for three. She wanted a better life. She wanted to be more than what she had become.\" He told him seriously. He took a deep breath before continuing, \"She's been staying with me since she got out and she's been going to meetings and her school is letting her catch up what she missed over the summer online. When she has a bad day, she calls her sponsor, who is also a programmer, and they go over coding while they talk about whatever set her off.\" \" My sister is one of the strongest people I have ever known and I am so proud of her. She's smart and bright and she can bring a light to anyone who hides in the darkness, despite having her own dark cloud above her.\" \" So, yes, Mr. Chetty, I think it is a smart idea to accept her into the program.\" She had received a personal acceptance e-mail from Chetty the next day. She never knew that Lyle had talk to him. Lyle had just entered his office with the others behind him when he spotted her. She was on the couch that she loved so much, curled into a tight ball in the corner. Her face was buried in her knees and he could see that her shoulders were shaking. He tensed when he saw the forming bruises on her arms. She was mumbling something over and over again, but it was her hand, flipping a familiar coin, that had him knowing that something happened. Something seriously wrong happened. He was by her side instantly, forgetting that his team was in the room with them and was staring at the scene with wide eyes. He didn't realize that Stuart, who he had been giving hell since he found out what he said to Maya, was looking at her with such an intense worry that on any normal occasion he would have called him out on it. \"Maya?\" He called out softly, placing a calming hand on her shoulder. He snatched it way when she flinched violently. \"Maya, what happened?\" He asked, concern seeping into his voice. She gripped the coin tighter as if she was reassuring herself. He took a deep breath, hating for what he was about to do. \"Maya!\" He snapped loudly, his heart squeezing when she winced again, but it did the trick as her head shot up. She had tears running down her face. Lyle moved so that he was in kneeling in front of her and he slowly brought his hands up and covered hers. She tensed, but didn't remove them. \"Maya. It's me. Okay, you're safe. It's Lyle. Everything is going to be okay.\" He reassured her softly, his thumbs rubbing soothing circles on her wrists. She blinked at him. \"I'm sorry.\" She rasped, voice cracking from her tears. He shook his head and arms were suddenly around him and he wrapped her up in his, holding her close, hoping to protect her from the monsters she still faced. He pressed a hard kiss to her temple, breathing in the familiar coconut and lime shampoo that she uses, as the scent slowly calmed his racing heart. \"You have nothing to be sorry about. Do you understand me? Nothing.\" He pledged to her as she started sobbing again. He carefully maneuvered so that he was on the couch and he cradled her to him. \"What's going on?\" He heard Yo-Yo ask someone and looked up instantly, having completely forgotten about them. He saw Neha open her mouth to say something and he tensed wondering if she was going to make a crack about his sister, but surprisingly it was Stuart that shot her a look that stopped her from saying anything. \"Guys, let's leave them alone.\" Billy told them quietly and he gave the older man a grateful look. \"Let's grab some ice cream.\" The others looked like they didn't want to leave, but Billy gave them a pointed expression that had them reconsidering and they quietly shuffled out of the office. He closed his eyes, sighing in relief now that they were alone. Someone cleared their throat softly and his eyes flew opened to see Stuart standing in front of him, awkwardly shifting from foot to foot and he could see him clenching his hand around his phone. \"What kind of ice cream does she like?\" The boy asked as he watched Maya continue crying into his shoulder, she was no longer sobbing, but she was still shaking and he tighten his hold on her. He was tempted to decline that offer, but Maya had pulled back so that she could look up at Stuart. Something flashed in the other boy's eyes as he took in the broken girl before him. Her hair was in disarray and some strands were sticking her wet face, her blue eyes were bloodshot and shining wetly as tears continued to slowly fall, her nose was running and she would let out the occasion hiccup. She looked like a mess. And Stuart didn't seem to care as he gazed down at her, waiting for an answer. \"Ch-chocolate Chip-ip Cookie D-dough.\" She said, peered up at him in curiosity. Lyle bit his lip to stop himself from asking why she answered him. Stuart nodded before looking at him silently asking if he wanted anything, but left after Lyle shook his head. Lyle stared after him wondering if there was more to the kid than he thought. Stuart couldn't get her broken expression out of his mind. He hasn't seen her since their argument a week ago and then there she was in her brother's office, crying away her demons as she clutched something in her hand. He had to wonder what had happened. Why do you even care? A voice asked as they approached the ice cream vendor that was outside. I don't, he told himself firmly as he watched his team order their ice cream with Nick paying for them, but even I wouldn't ignore a crying girl. He thought back to when she looked up at him, eyes filled with tears, face wet and hair sticking to her, but she had looked up at him, daring him to say something. To comment on her moment of weakness. He couldn't. He didn't want too. He just wanted to know if she wanted ice cream. \"Stuart?\" Nick's voice pulled him back and he glanced at him emotionlessly. \"Yeah?\" \"Are you going to get any?\" Nick asked, waving his hand towards the vendor. He nodded, \"I've got mine.\" He said, pulling out his wallet, but Nick shook his head. \"No seriously. Let me pay for mine.\" Stuart didn't know why he was insisting on paying for his and Maya's, but he wasn't in the mood to question it just yet. Nick backed off and grabbed his rocky road. \"I'll get a moose track and a dish of cookie dough please.\" He ordered, pulling a ten out and handing it to the man. He ignored the confused looks from Neha and Yo-Yo and the knowing ones from Nick and Billy. \"Hungry?\" Yo-Yo asked innocently and he shrugged, not answering. They started to head back to into the building once everyone had their dessert and as Stuart ate his moose tracks the dish of cookie dough chilled his hand making the person who it was for stay front and center in his mind. I'm just doing something nice for someone. It's no big deal. He told himself as the others started talking about what they had witnessed between their team manager and his sister. Neha scoffed at something Yo-Yo said, \"Please, she was probably just upset about the layout. I heard she was leading the team on the project and it was probably becoming too much.\" He heard the disdain in her voice and he bit his tongue to stop himself from lashing out. He saw Nick shake his head, \"Nah, that's not it. Didn't you see the bruises that were on her arms? Someone did that to her; probably in the last few hours from the looks of them.\" He did notice them. He had clenched his phone tight in his hand that he wondered if he was going to break it. He didn't like the idea of someone hurting her. \"What was she holding?\" Yo-Yo asked. He thought back to the object in her hand. It looked small like maybe the size of a poker chip, but he couldn't tell. \"Something important or at least meaningful.\" Billy answered. \"Who cares?\" Neha muttered and for some reason Stuart snapped as he tossed his cone in a nearby trash can before whirling around. \"What the fuck is your problem?\" He hissed making her step back having not expecting an attack. She looked at him in confusion and that just pissed him off even more. \"What are you talking about?\" \"You've been making digs at Maya since you met her. What the hell did she ever do to you?\" He snarled as he took a step towards her. He felt Billy step up to him, placing a hand on his shoulder to keep him back. \"Because I can't stand people like her.\" Neha spat at him. \"And I'm surprised you're defending her! You're the one who said it first.\" \"People like her?\" He repeated bewildered. \"Said what first?\" \"Orientation. After the meeting? You weren't the only one who forgot something.\" She told him and Stuart froze as he remembered what she was referring too. Sleeping with your boss? Yeah, I would say so. She had been there when he accused Maya of sleeping her way into a job. Somehow he knew that was going to bite him in the ass. \"And I was wrong.\" She scoffed again, \"Yeah, okay.\" She said sarcastically. \"You don't know her.\" He threw at her. \"Neither do you!\" She cried out and he was surprised at the emotion in her voice. \"Okay.\" Nick stepped between them as they glared at each other. \"Why don't we just calm down?\" He suggested. He ignored him, \"I know a lot more than you do!\" He snapped at her. \"Please, you just think she's a great set of tits.\" She snarled at him. He had to step away as he stared at her looking like she had slapped him. She had just insulted whatever feelings he had for Maya. Yes, he noticed her physical beauty the moment he laid eyes on her at orientation, but it was the fire and defiance and the intelligence in her eyes, the stubborn set of her shoulders, her flirtation nature when she was in a good mood and her broken vulnerability that had him fascinated. \"You don't know what I think.\" Stuart whispered strangely calm. He didn't bother waiting for one of them to say something as he turned and stalked away. The ice cream was just starting to melt when he handed it to Maya a few minutes later. This time he couldn't ignore the way his heart started to race when she smiled at him. Fuck, he thought to himself as she ate her ice cream while giving Lyle reassuring looks, who looked like he wanted to hit something. He liked her. AWWW! He likes her. He actually likes her. Okay, so it was totally obvious, but still. Plus, is Lyle going to start warming up to Stuart now? And now you know why Neha's not impressed! But, side note: Parsons? Sexual harassment much? Trust me it's not fun to deal with. People might think that it's all in good fun when you're joking around, but trust me when I say that it takes something away from someone. I've had someone who I worked with sexual harass me. Thoughts? Reviews are loved. -ARF[Chapter 8] I'm back! Did you miss me? Probably not. lol. Thanks for reviews, favorites, and alerts. You guys are simply amazing. SPOILER ALERT: a complaint is filed, Lyle worries, a coin is lost, Marielena appears and some startlingly intense feelings pop up. Disclaimer: Don't own. Never will. Might as well deal with that now. Lyle was getting on her nerves. She had told him what happened after Stuart had left and he was understandably furious, especially when she told him that her boss had been hitting on her long before the attack today. She could still taste him on her mouth and it made her want to gag. She closed her eyes with tears still clinging to her lashes. She was much calmer now, no longer sobbing, but a few tears still leaked out and she brushed them away as she spoke, \"Lyle, I'll tell someone. I just,\" she paused, struggling to find the right words, \"I need to forget for a moment. Okay, it brought back some memories.\" Her brother shut his mouth as he grabbed her free hand in his. She relaxed at the comforting touch, leaning her head on his shoulder. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" He asked; hurt etching in his tone at the thought that she couldn't trust him with this. Maya stared at the spot Stuart had been standing when he asked what kind of ice cream she liked. She took in the knowledge that he didn't ask any personal questions with a grateful eye. \"Because all it was really bad flirting before now.\" She told him honestly, \"I never expected him to do this.\" He didn't say anything as he stared straight ahead. She sighed, poking him in the side causing him to squirm away. \"I'm sorry, Lyle.\" Lyle grabbed the hand that was clutching her two year sobriety chip; she took in the familiar weight of the object. It was no longer cool, but warm from the heat of her hand, but she let the meaning of it wash over her, reminding her she didn't need the drugs to make the pain or the memory go away. \"Are you sure?\" He asked seriously, moving brown eyes to search into her blue ones. She stared at him, letting him figure out that she was no longer feeling out the edge of that line. She never wanted to go back to that life. Maya squeezed his hand reassuringly. \"I'm not there.\" She told him and knew that he would understand her meaning. He relaxed, but he still looked like he wanted to hit something. She couldn't comment on it as Stuart walked back in with a dish in his hand. He handed it to her as she placed her coin on the table and the look on his face when she smiled up at him had her stomach twisting pleasantly. \"Thank you.\" She said after swallowing a bit. He shrugged, \"It's just ice cream.\" \"I wasn't thanking you for the ice cream.\" She told him, making both him and Lyle look at her curiously. \"It was for not asking any questions.\" \"Not my business why you decided to have an emotional breakdown in your brother's office.\" He said plainly and she shook her head at him in annoyance. \"Why do you do that?\" She bit out as Lyle stole a bite of her ice cream; she passed it to him letting him have some. \"Do what?\" \"Brush everything to the side like it's nothing. I'm showing you gratitude and you're acting like you didn't have a care in the world.\" \"Not all of us can deal with our emotions up front.\" He pointed out. She let out a bitter laugh as the office door opened and in walked someone she didn't recognize. \"Trust me when I say that I'm an emotional fuck up.\" She informed him. Lyle stood up walking over to the woman. Stuart stared at her, trying to figure out what she meant as he moved to sit at one of the desks. He chose the one right in front of her. \"Can I help you?\" Lyle asked the woman, making her look up. She was tall, thin woman, who looked to be in her mid-thirties. Her blond hair was pulled up in a severe bun. Thing, rectangular glasses framed her brown eyes. She was wearing a dark blue suit with a skirt with black sensible heels. She was holding a file in her hand. She looked completely out of place in Google, which meant one of two things. She's was either from a) Legal or b) Human Resources. Her bet was on b. \"Maya Spaulding?\" The woman asked redundantly as she looked at her, taking in her dried, tear stained face, messy hair, bloodshot eyes, and the bruises on her arm. \"Yes?\" \"I'm Monica Carmichael from Human Resources.\" Maya's hands began to sweat as she nervously stood up to stand next to her brother. She chewed on her lip for moment as she worried that Julian somehow managed to turn this around to make him look like the victim. \"What can I do for Human Resources?\" \"A complaint against your boss, Julian Parsons, was filed an hour ago citing the he allegedly forced himself on you in his office earlier today.\" She heard Stuart suck in a breath. It wasn't against her. Someone filed it against Julian. \"Oh?\" \"Did this actually happen?\" She swallowed thickly, somehow not able to get the words out. She could see the rest of the team make their way back to the office. When the door opened they paused taking in the scene. Lyle was standing protectively in front of his arms crossed his chest. She had at some point gripped his arm to anchor herself. Stuart was staring at her intensely, eyes scanning the bruises and anymore injuries that she could possibly have. All while a strict looking woman stood in front of her. \"Yes.\" She choked out with a small nod. \"Yes, he did force himself on me.\" She could hear the others gasp at her words and she wasn't ashamed of what she just admitted in front of them. Embarrassed beyond belief, but not ashamed that she got out of there. The woman nodded and suddenly her whole demeanor changed. She had softened her gaze, relaxed her posture and gave her a reassuring smile. \"We're going to need you to stop by the HR offices to help us gather some more evidence, but that can be done at later time. Why don't you head home and get some rest?\" Monica had suggested kindly and she agreed. \"That's sounds like a good idea.\" She admitted feeling strangely tired with it being only being about 3:30 in the afternoon. She could really use a nap. \"Come on, I'll take you home.\" She heard Lyle mutter, but she shook her head, putting a hand on his arm to stop him. \"No. Lyle, stay here and get some work done.\" She said even as her hand tightened her grip. \"Not happening, Maya.\" \"Please.\" She pleaded quietly, \"I just need to be alone right now.\" His jaw clenched and she could see it in his eyes that he thought that this way a bad idea. \"I'll have Marielena take me home and she can check the house for anything.\" She reasoned and she saw him softening at the mention of her best friend. \"You can even turn on the GPS on my phone if you want, but I'm not going to,\" She glanced around them office as everyone watched the two of them. \" break.\" She said eventually. He was quiet as he considered her terms before holding a hand out. Sighing in relief, she handed him her phone and watching with an impassive eye, but a heavy heart as he activated the GPS. He's doing it because he loves you, because he's only worried about, he doesn't want you to relapse again. Not after everything you achieved so fare, she told herself determinedly. Maya took it back once he was done. She gave him a small, sad smile as she walked over to him. Placing a small comforting kiss on his cheek, \"I'm not there.\" She whispered calmingly. \"Doesn't mean I won't worry.\" She stepped back and gave the others a slightly embarrassed smile. \"Sorry for getting in the way of your plans.\" She apologized. Billy and Nick shook their head. \"Don't worry about it.\" Nick reassured her. \"We get that you were on the edge.\" She tensed at his words as she eyed him curiously. They didn't elaborate and she didn't know if she was grateful or not for that. \"I'll see you later.\" She told Lyle as she walked out. She didn't realize that she had left her coin on the table or that someone had spotted it and quickly grabbed it. Few Hours Later Marielena had left about twenty minutes after of arriving, doing the usual search of the entire apartment. Even though it was her idea, it still sucked that it resulted in this just so she could a few hours by herself after the attack. Her breath caught because holy shit, she was attack at work. Her boss attacked her. Her friend even went through her purse and her work bag and it was her that informed her that it was missing. \"Maya, I thought you kept your sobriety coin in your purse?\" Marielena asked as she continued to search the bags. \"I do, but if it's a bad day then it's usual in my pocket.\" Her hand ghosted over her pocket where it would be hidden from everyone, but still the weight of it was reassuring. She froze when her fingers didn't meet the soothing metal. Where is it? Where's my coin? She panicked as she started patting her other pockets, hoping that she had placed it one of them. \"Maya?\" Marielena had called out. Her breath was stuck in her throat as she rushed to where her friend was at; roughly grabbing the purse out of her hand and proceeded to dump the contents out on her table. She searched through the spilled items as her heart clenched at the thought it missing. Marielena placed a gently hand on her arm. \"Maya, what's wrong?\" \"It's gone.\" She whispered, sudden tears threatening to fall. \"My coin is gone.\" \"Did you leave it at the office?\" She paused as the memory of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and warm whiskey eyes came to mind. Falling into the chair, she closed her eyes remembering that she had set it down when Stuart had given her the ice cream. \"It's in Lyle's office.\" She told her brokenly. \"Hey. It's okay. I'll tell him that you left it there and I'm sure he'll bring it home.\" Marielena spoke softly. She nodded, not wanting to speak. \"I better go.\" \"Bye.\" She choked out. After Marielena had left it took about fifteen minutes to stop berating herself for leaving her coin at work and for her to head to her room and change into a pair of sweatpants and a tank top. Grabbing a beer from the fridge, she ended up on the couch, bringing her legs up to hug them to her chest, much like how she was when Lyle had found her. She took a deep, shuddering breath as the events of the past few hours slammed into her. Tears were falling, but she wasn't sobbing as she processed the news. Her boss forced himself on her in his office where anyone could've walked in. She fought back as a past memory had assaulted her. Someone filled a complaint against him on her behalf. She fled to Lyle hoping his presence would help with the sudden need to make the pain go away. Stuart wasn't that bad of a guy when it came to personal demons. She was too tired to ignore the way her heart had picked up at the thought of the man. It was comforting and welcomed to simply think about a man and what he made her feel because she couldn't deny it anymore, even if she wanted to. He made her feel something. And that something was strong and could have the potential to be completely consuming. She thought back to the intense and focused look in his eyes when he was working the debugging challenge and what she had told Lyle a week ago about wanting to take him home and have her way with him. She imagine him putting that same focus and intensity on the way he would move calculating hands down her body to caress, soothe and cup every inch of her skin. The way he would move those full and distracting lips down her neck, over her collarbone and finally to her chest. His whiskey eyes deepening to a dark rum as they seared into her as he moved inside her. Stretching her in the most pleasant ways. She could picture herself running her hand through his hair after whipping that beanie off, feeling the strands tickle her palm. She would be kissing, licking and nipping at his skin on his neck, his shoulders and chest. Feels those sinewy muscles react to her touch as she touched his back soothingly. Her legs would wrap around him tightly and she would throw her head back, screaming his name as she came. He would tense and pick up speed, losing the erotic rhythm they had set. His lips would be everywhere; her chest, neck, lips, forehead. He would come with a groan of her own name and he would eventually collapse on her, his weight welcomed and comforting. She bit her lip, blinking back to reality. Her skin felt clammy, her blood to warm to the touch and her heart was beating wildly in her chest as she breathed shallowly. Yes, she imagined that sex with Stuart would be overwhelmingly shattering. But it wasn't just sex that had her heart hammering. She could imagine waking up on a Sunday morning wrapped in his arms and just kiss and cuddle innocently. They would sit on the couch with the TV playing quietly in the background as they would eat cereal, poking fun at each other and steal kisses. Mostly steal kisses. Or they would stay in bed and sleep till noon or they would make love well into the afternoon, only leaving the bedroom for food. She could see him hanging out with Lyle and Marielena, who were finally together, and they would geek over the newest software update or the latest episode in Doctor Who (he seemed like a Doctor Who fan). She could see herself forcing him to come outside as it rained and make him dance with her; he would pull her close to keep them warm because wearing coats in the middle of dancing in the rain was ridiculous. She could see a life with him that was laughter and smiles and fights and making up and so much feeling that her heart nearly swelled at the thought. Oh god, she thought with blinding panic, this is getting dangerous. This is very dangerous. Because she could see herself falling for him so hard. Because she could see herself telling him about her past and him attending her anniversary meetings. Because the thought of that last one, the thought of him accepting her and becoming an anchor for her, petrified her immensely. Maya reached up and scratched her arm wincing when pain shot through it. Looking down, she remembered the bruises that Julian had left on her. Marking her. All thoughts of Stuart and whatever feelings vanished as she rushed to the bathroom as her ice cream and beer came back up. The tears fell harder and quiet sobs filled the bathroom as she blindly reached up to flush the toilet. She wiped at her mouth, leaning against the tub. He had marked her. Branded her like she was cattle. Her stomach rolled again and her fingers itched to grab her phone and call her old dealer. Never mind that he was New York. She didn't know how long she stayed there with the cool tile seeping into her bones and the pressure of the tub pressing into her back uncomfortably. But she was startled out of the numb state she was in when there was a knock on the door. Carefully standing up, she walked out of the bathroom making sure not to look in the mirror as she passed. The knocking kept coming and her irritation kept growing. The glare that she was wearing melted away into shock when she threw the door opened. \"Neha?\" Whoa there! Maya's got some major feelings for Stuart. What does Neha want now? And where is Maya's coin? Thoughts? Reviews are loved. -ARF[Chapter 9] Before I get started, just to avoid any confusion, this is me. This is AlmontRaidersForever. I just felt like it was time for a change and gave myself a new pen name. So, don't freak out people. It is still me. But anyways... I'm back! I am so so so sorry for the late update. My muse decided to take a break and then this first scene was giving me issues (to be honest I'm still iffy on it), but I finally finished it. So, again thank you everyone for sticking with me and reviewing and adding Just Press Play to your favorites and alert lists. SPOILERS: Neha and Maya come to cease fire, Stuart gives some words of comfort, Maya and Marielena bond, Graham returns, and Maya kidnaps Stuart! Disclaimer: Don't own. Never will. Maya stared at the other girl stunned that she was here. At her apartment. Where she lived. Why was she here? \"Hi.\" Neha said nervously, her hands wringing together. She stepped out of the apartment confusedly looking down the hall, not really knowing what she was looking for, but the disappointment she felt had her wondering if it was because Stuart wasn't there instead. \"How did you know where I live?\" She asked after a moment, confusion still clouding her senses. Neha lifted her phone, \"The employee directory came up when I googled it.\" Her brows furrowed, \"It doesn't show addresses.\" The girl shrugged, \"Once I saw the land line number I looked it up in the white pages.\" \"Why?\" Neha started to fidget as she thought about her answer before reaching into her bag. As she searched for something Maya eyed her cautiously, a sinking feeling forming in the pit of her stomach. She doesn't have it. She doesn't have it. She does not have it, she repeated in her head. She really hoped that out of all people that Neha didn't find it. She'd rather not get talked down to again. Finally, Neha pulled something out of her purse and held out her hand. A small familiar looking green coin rested innocently in her hand. While the relief was there at the sight of it, she felt a flare of annoyance. She snatched up the coin, the weight of it anchoring her and she felt the pressure ease just a little bit. \"Thanks.\" She bit out. Neha stood there still, \"Two years?\" She asked softly, \"That's amazing Maya.\" \"I know.\" \"I'm sure you worked hard.\" She said and the combination of the words and the knowing and pitying tone in her voice caused her to snap. \"Don't act like you know what I'm going through.\" Maya snapped and Neha stepped back startled. \"I-I wasn't.\" She started, \"I mean I could only imagine what you went through.\" Maya shook her head, \"Would you just stop? Just stop talking okay.\" Maya took a deep breath, \"You can't imagine what I went through. No one can expect for other addicts. Everyone always thinks that they know what they would do or how they would deal with it, but they can't because they never had to deal with an addiction.\" \"I know that. I didn't mea-\" \"Yes, you did, Neha. Don't lie. It's not becoming.\" Maya sneered. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you.\" Neha apologized. She let a sharp bark of laughter, \"Insult me? Since I've met you all you've been doing is insulting me and I've never done shit to you.\" Neha flinched, \"I know and I'm sorry.\" Maya stared at her with a hard look in her eyes. \"To be honest Neha, I just don't care anymore.\" \"I was jealous.\" Neha blurted out. She didn't say anything, but gave her a look that said and the warrants being a bitch? \"You've been here for three years already and we're the same age and I overheard you and Stuart on orientation when he accused of sleeping with your boss and I believed it.\" Neha explained. Maya tensed at the mention of the day. \"So, I assume that you didn't hear me set him straight right after that?\" Neha nodded, \"I walked way before you could. I didn't want to listen to any excuses that you came up with.\" \"So, what changed your mind?\" \"Today. When that woman came from Human Resources and then I saw the coin.\" She shrugged, \"I realized that there is a lot more about you then I know.\" Maya let out a breath, \"There is, Neha. You really don't know what I've been through in my life. So, the next time you meet someone and overhear something, try not to pass judgment on them straight away because there's a pretty good change that there is more to the story.\" \"I know and I am sorry, Maya.\" \"I know and I accept it, but why do I have the feeling that it also had to deal with Stuart?\" Neha blushed slightly, \"I thought he was cute the first time I saw him and I enjoyed arguing with him more than I should.\" She softened realizing what the other girl was saying, \"You formed a crush on him.\" The Indian girl nodded, \"Yeah, but I know nothing is going to come of it.\" \"You don't know that.\" She pressed, the words leaving a bitter taste in mouth. \"Yeah, I do. I've seen you two around each other and there's something there.\" Maya shook her head, \"There's nothing between me and Stuart.\" The thoughts from earlier flashed in her mind and she shifted uncomfortably. Neha laughed, \"Yeah, there is and you know it.\" \"Whatever you say.\" \"I should probably go,\" Neha said, \"but do you think we could start over? Or at least try?\" She asked hesitantly. She gave the girl a small smile. \"Yeah, we can do that.\" \"Great!\" Neha exclaimed, \"I'll see you later.\" \"See ya.\" Maya watched as Neha walked away. She closed the door when the girl reached the elevator. Shaking her head, she asked herself one thing as she smoothed her thumb over her coin. What just happened? Next Day She couldn't do it. The opportunity to finally tell was here and yet she couldn't do it. Maya paced back and forth, eyeing the door every so often. Every time she finally talked herself into opening the door, she chicken out once her hand was on the handle and she'd repeat the process. She's been doing this for the pass twenty minutes. \"Come on, Maya. You can do this.\" She muttered to herself, stopping to stare at the door; her heart pounding on the words. Human Resources Oh god, I can't do this, she thought anxiously, her throat closing up. \"Maya?\" A familiar voice called out. Jumping, she whipped around to see Stuart staring at her, concern shining in his whiskey eyes. The memory of her fantasy flashed before her and all she saw was dark rum and all she could feel was pleasure that she hadn't experienced in a while. \"Maya?\" He asked again, pulling her back to reality. She blinked and looked up to see him standing much closer. She flushed, shoving those thoughts in a deep dark corner in the back of her mind to never be seen again. \"Ye-\" her voice cracked and she cleared her throat embarrassedly, \"yeah?\" He eyed her worriedly and she could feel her heart swell, \"Are you okay?\" \"Of course!\" She exclaimed loudly making her wince and he raised an eyebrow. She chuckled in defeat, eyes once again returning to the door. \"No. I'm really not.\" His own eyes went to the door and understanding came to him. \"Hey,\" he said softly, a hand resting on her arm. He gave a gently tug to make her face him. \"It's going to be okay.\" \"How do you know?\" She asked uncertainly. \"Because it was filed against him, wasn't it?\" He asked rhetorically, but she nodded anyways, \"Then you just need to tell them what had happened.\" \"I don't know if I can do that, Stuart.\" She whispered. He gave her arm a reassuring squeeze, \"You can.\" She looked up at him curiously, \"What make you think that?\" He shrugged, \"I don't know you, but from what I've seen you have a strength that can get you through anything. So, go in there,\" he pointed to the door, \"tell them what happened and get the asshole fired.\" Maya laughed light, looking up at him with a smile both on her lips and in her eyes as his words gave her a confidence she hadn't felt lately. With a nod of her head, she walked over to the door, but she paused before she opened it. She turned around and walked back up to him. \"Maya-\" She cut him off, pressing her lips to his cheek. Her heart pounded loudly in her chest that she was sure that he could hear it. She pulled back slightly, lips just inches away from his cheek. Her spearmint breath wafted over his face. \"Thank you.\" She whispered looking up at him with gratitude in her eyes. His eyes locked onto hers, boring into them with an intensity that her breath caught. \"You're welcome.\" She gave him a small smile before pulling away and confidently walking through the door. She could do this. Two Hours Later Marielena's Dance Studio The dance studio was empty when Maya walked in. Marielena stopped dancing when she spotted her friend in the mirrors. Quickly rushing to the stereo, she paused the music. \"Maya, what's wrong?\" She asked taking in her appearance. The black and green checkered over shirt and the white v-neck tee-shirt were slightly rumple as though she had kept fidgeting and nervously played with the fabrics. The black beret was off centered. Her skinny black denim covered legs were shaking slightly; making the heels of her green high top Chuck Taylors hit the floor softly. Her blue eyes were outlined with black eyeliner and a small amount of mascara; they were also shining with unshed tears. Her lips that were once shining with a pink lip gloss were now being chewed on. Maya shook her head taking a deep shuddering breath before promptly bursting into tears. Marielena quickly gathered her friend in her arms, providing any comfort that she could offer. Glancing around the room, she spotted a small sofa couch in the corner. She gently coaxed Maya that direction. Once seated, she let Maya cry out the tears. She didn't say anything, just rubbed her back and held her like she would a small child. A few minutes later, the sobbing faded out, leaving Maya a hiccupping mess. They pulled away from each other, though Marielena made sure to keep an arm around Maya's shoulders. \"What happened, Maya?\" She asked again. Wiping her eyes, she smeared her eye make-up causing her to groan, \"Great I look like a raccoon now.\" Marielena pulled her up and dragged her to the women's restroom. Maya walked to the sink, tossing her hat on the counter haphazardly and turned the sink on. She splashed cold water to her face, gently scrubbing away her make-up. Blindly reaching for a paper towel, she spoke, \"I was with Human Resources.\" Her friend stayed quiet knowing she had to get this out now or it would never would until the worst possible time. Dabbing the towel to her ruined eye make-up she continued on, \"I told them about his previous advances. About the invitations to celebratory lunches and dinner meetings, about the too casual touches and the words that said more than they meant.\" She breathed deeply, no longer removing her make-up, but her fists rested on the counter as she stared down at the ground with her body tense. \"I told them about what happened yesterday; how he was proud ,\" she spat the word, \"of the work that I had accomplished and wanted to take me out, how I declined, but he just got so mad that I kept playing hard to get ,\" the words were laced heavily with sarcasm. \"And he just wouldn't let go or take no for an answer.\" She looked up, eyes colliding with Marielena's in the mirror, \"Why didn't he let go?\" She asked softly, her tone almost childlike. Marielena walked up to her, resting a hand on her shoulder reassuringly, \"Because he's a creep and thinks that he can take whatever he wants and damn the consequences.\" \"Why did it have to be me?\" Maya asked, but Marielena heard the real question in those words. Why can't things just go right for once in my life? She answered truthfully, \"I don't know.\" She was on her way to grab a tea to help with her headache and sore throat when she spotted them. They stood tall, proud and tense, eyes glaring daggers at each other. They were talking quietly, though heatedly as Stuart spat something at Graham, who chuckled darkly. Glancing around, she noticed that no one was really giving the interns any notice. Without a second thought, she quickly rushed over. When she was close enough, she almost wished she walked away as Stuart stepped closer to the English boy, eyes glittering murderously, and a hand fisting the blue dress shirt. \" Leave her alone.\" He hissed sharply and somehow she knew they were referring to her. \"What? Afraid she'll come to me for comfort?\" Graham questioned arrogantly. She nearly gagged at his words. Please, I'd rather kiss Yo-Yo, she thought, feeling only slightly guilty about her attitude towards the socially awkward boy. Stuart snorted, \"No, because she has standards.\" She smiled to herself, a warm feeling rushing through her blood as he defended her. Usually she hated a guy fighting for her. She hadn't needed someone to fight her battles since she was a seventeen year old recovering drug addict and needed her brother's protection. But once again things just seemed to be different with Stuart and she honestly didn't know what to make of it, but she kind of wanted to find out. \"And you think you meet them?\" Graham laughed mockingly, bringing her back to reality. The other boy shrugged, \"Doesn't matter if I do or don't, it's her choice on who she decides to spend time with, but I sure as hell knows that it won't be you.\" \"Please, I can get any girl that I want,\" The British boy boasted, \"and I will get Maya.\" She had enough of this. She stepped forward to tell Graham off when Stuart's words stopped her cold. \"No, I don't think you will.\" He said softly making her strain to hear. \"Do you want to know how I know that?\" He asked rhetorically, \"Because Maya is an intelligent, beautiful, funny and caring young woman, who loves her brother and her job, and would do anything for her friends. She's been hurt in the past and has dealt with over confident assholes like you before and knows to stay away. So, I'd suggest you do just that.\" He spoke calmly with just a small edge to his tone, \" Stay away.\" Her breath caught in her throat as she watched him stalk away from Graham, who glaring at his back before leaving in the opposite direction. She blinked, trying to process what exactly just happened when she felt a nudge on her arm. Startled, she looked over to see Nick giving her a concerned look. \"You okay?\" \"Uh-I think so.\" She said though it sound more like question to her as her eyes went back into the direction Stuart went. \"He's right you know.\" Nick pointed out making her look over to him in confusion. He jerked his head the same way she just looking at. \"Stuart. You deserve better than the Grahams of the world.\" She let out a small laugh, \"Oh yeah? And just who do you think I deserve then?\" \"The Stuarts of the world seem like good guys.\" He said nonchalantly. Her heart leapt in her throat, \"Yeah, I guess they do.\" She whispered. He gave her an understanding smile and a gentle push towards the court yard, \"Tell him that Lyle wants to have a team meeting at 5.\" She nodded absently as she started making her way to the doors. She paused, turning around, \"Thanks Nick.\" He waved her off, \"It's not a problem Maya. Now go.\" She grinned before rushing outside. She found him heading off the campus. She rushed to him, hoping to catch up to him. \"Stuart!\" She called out causing him to tense, but he stopped and turned around. He looked surprised to see her running towards him. \"Maya?\" He greeted confusedly. She skidded to a stop in front of him, nearly tripping over her feet. She quickly grabbed his arm that he wrapped around her to steady her. Flushing at both the contact and the embarrassing stop, she cleared her throat sheepishly. \"What's going on?\" He asked giving her a searching look. She shook her head, \"No. I just,\" she paused feeling a blush form on her cheeks, \"I heard you and Graham.\" She blurted out. He tensed, removing his arm from her waist and stepping away from her. She nearly followed wanting him close to her. \"How much?\" He bit out making her step back at his tone. \"I got there when you said I had standards.\" She informed him. He nodded curtly and she looked at him confused as to why he was reacting this way. She cautiously stepped closer to him. When he didn't react, she continued to move closer until they were just inches away. \"Thank you,\" she whispered and he turned those wonderfully sinful whiskey eyes on her, \"for defending me.\" He relaxed somewhat as he nodded to her, \"You're welcome.\" She looked around suddenly, \"Were you going somewhere?\" She asked curiously. \"Not really. I just needed to get out of there.\" He said, eyes glancing at the building behind her. Maya lowered her eyes to his chest, not really looking as she thought. She bit her lip unknowingly drawing his attention to them and he tensed once more. \"Come with me.\" She said, grabbing his hand, \"I want to take you somewhere.\" Bewildered, he stumbled as he was pulled in the direction of her car. \"Where are we going?\" He asked once they were buckled in her 2013 Jeep Cherokee. \"I missed lunch. So, we are going to grab some.\" She told him as she started her car. He glanced out the window as the pulled out the parking lot. \"How do you like mac & cheese?\" She asked giving him a sideways glance with a mischievous grin. He raised an eyebrow, \"What like the boxed stuff?\" She laughed with a shake of her head. \"Please, I'm talking about the real deal here.\" She said, \"I'm about to make your world explode.\" Stuart swallowed thickly at her words, the second meaning hitting him in his gut. She would make his world explode? He didn't doubt it for second. And there you go! So, Maya finally learns why Neha didn't like her and they settled their differences (somewhat), and Stuart shows up in Maya's time of need (aww!), Marielena is an awesome best friend, Graham is a pig while Stuart isn't, Nick is awesome, and Maya's hungry for mac & cheese and some time with Stuart. Do you believe Neha is serious about starting over? How do you think Stuart is reacting to that kiss (so what if it was on his cheek? She still kissed him!)? Does Graham just need to go away? And how else will Maya make Stuart's world explode (keep your answers PG-13 people!)? Thoughts? Theories? -CreateAnInsaneWorld (formerly AlmontRaidersForver)[Chapter 10] I have been relentlessly working on this chapter for the passed three days and I finished! Thank you all for the reviews they mean the world to me. SPOILERS: Maya and Stuart bond over mac & cheese and Lyle gives Stuart a certain talk Disclaimer: Don't own. Never will. Same goes with Homeroom Mac & Cheese and Harry Potter. Homeroom Mac & Cheese Oakland, California Maya watched as Stuart took in the restaurant; from the wooden tables and chairs to the wall made of windows to the chalkboards hanging up. They sat down in the booth waiting for the server. \"You come all the way to Oakland just for mac and cheese?\" Stuart asked as he took in the restaurant. It had cozy, anyone is welcome and we'll know your name by the time you leave, feel to it. Just from the atmosphere he could see why she liked this place. She shook her head, \"This isn't just your ordinary mac and cheese. This stuff is pure heaven.\" She boasted, \"This ruins all other mac and cheese for you. Trust me on this.\" He looked skeptical, \"I doubt it.\" \"Fine, don't believe me, but I bet that you'll think the same when we leave.\" She said determinedly. \"And if you're wrong?\" She shrugged, \"Then I'll do whatever you want.\" She answered. He raised his eyebrows at the loaded statement. \"But if I'm right you do whatever I want.\" She bargained. He thought it over for a moment. When the waitress arrived to their table he answered, \"Deal.\" Maya beamed before ordering a glass of Dry Creek Red Wine and Stuart ordered water. She pouted at him slightly, \"Boring.\" \"It's 2 in the afternoon.\" He pointed out. \"So? There's nothing wrong with ordering a glass of wine to go with your lunch.\" She explained. \"Not a wine drinker.\" \"You probably never drank any alcohol before.\" She teased lightly causing him to glare at her. \"I have too.\" He defended. \"Oh yeah? What a beer?\" She asked mockingly before shaking her head, \"Doesn't count.\" \"It does too!\" He exclaimed a laugh in his voice. \"Please,\" She said in amusement, \"everyone has a had beer by the time their sixteen. So, no Stuart it really doesn't.\" \"Oh yeah? What were you? A major party girl at sixteen then?\" He shot jokingly, but the carefree expression on her face was wiped away and replaced with a guarded one. He stopped laughing, confused at the change of emotion. \"Maya?\" \"Let's just say I didn't make the best decisions at sixteen.\" She responded plainly. Stuart gave her a searching look, trying to determine how to broach the apparent sensitive subject. \"Like what?\" He asked tentatively. \"I was a sixteen year old freshman at Cornell University, Stuart.\" She said tightly, \"I tried anything to fit it.\" He reached over and covered her hands that were in fists with both of his. Her eyes shot to meet his and she hated the sympathetic look in his eyes. She tried to pull away, but he trapped her hands by pressing lightly against her wrist. \"I can't say that I understand what you went through because I don't, but if you ever need someone to talk to you about I don't anything really, you can come to me.\" He told her quietly as his thumbs gently skimmed over her knuckles. She took a deep breath, removing one of her hands from his grip and grabbed her glass of wine that the waitress just set down. Waving her away as they hadn't figured out what they wanted, she looked at him through her lashes. \"Maybe someday.\" She said eventually with a small smile that he returned. He released her hands and grabbed the menu to look it over. \"So, what's good here?\" He asked changing the subject. Relaxing now that the heavy conversation was done, she opened her own menu. \"Everything.\" She said honestly. He rolled his eyes at her answer as he grazed over the selections. They were quiet as they decided. The silence was a comfortable one, something that she hadn't dealt with in a while with anyone who wasn't Lyle. She savored the feeling knowing that things were going to get hectic in the coming weeks with the investigation into Julian, her projects that she had been assigned, and with helping Chetty with the internship. Maya glanced up, looking at Stuart over her menu. She study him for a moment and her heart pounded just like it had earlier that day as she took in his chocolate brown hair (she was right. It was spiked when he removed the beanie.), his whiskey eyes, full pink lips, and with everything that had happened today, she knew she was in trouble. She made a mental note to talk to Chetty when they returned. She closed the menu as the waitress came back. \"Have you decided?\" Maya asked him. He glanced up and shook his head, telling her that she could order first. \"I'll have the Mexican Mac and can I add hot peppers and spicy cauliflower, please?\" She asked. The waitress nodded, giving her a smile as she wrote down the order before turning to Stuart. \"I'll just have the Smokey Bacon Mac.\" He decided, closing the menu. The waitress wrote it down, took their menus and told them that their food would be up shortly. They sat in a comfortable silence. Maya rested her head on her hand as she gazed out the window and Stuart watched her. She could feel the weight of his stare and she forced herself not to react. After taking a sip of her wine, she spoke, \"So, tell me Stuart, why do you want to be at Google?\" She asked him curiously. He looked startled at the question, \"Why do you want to know?\" She gave him an impish smile with a shrug, \"I'd like to get know my future co-worker.\" \"Getting ahead of yourself aren't you?\" He asked rhetorically before shaking his head, \"Beside with my team I doubt we'll get the jobs.\" \"You're being too hard on Nick and Billy.\" She said softly causing him to scoff. \"Come on, Maya. They don't belong there.\" He believed. She sighed, almost irritated at the recurring statement. \"Maybe not, but you can't deny that they're not trying .\" She pointed out, \"Which what they're looking for as well. People, who are willing to try, work together as a team, and to be a part of something amazing.\" \"I get it, I do, but why are they here? At Google.\" He wondered out loud. She shrugged again, \"Unlike you and every other intern that's there that simply want the job, they are two that actually need it.\" \"And they can't get one anywhere else?\" \"I don't know why they choose Google, but they did.\" She said, \"And the interviewers obviously saw something in them to have accepted them into the program, otherwise they wouldn't be here.\" He sighed tiredly, \"Maybe, but I still say that I'm screwed out of this job.\" She looked at him curiously, \"So, you don't get the job at Google, but Stuart, I saw your file. You have gotten offers from Samsung and Apple, who by the way is one of our top competitors. You'll be all set if don't make it here.\" He shook his head, \"I've always wanted to be at Google.\" \"Why?\" She questioned, \"Why is it so important for you to be at Google?\" \"A bet.\" She blinked having not expected that. A feeling curled into her chest burning hot and hands twisted into fists. \"A bet?\" She asked incredulously lacing her tone. All this is because of freaking bet? She asked herself disgustedly. Who the hell does that? And he's badmouthing Nick and Billy for being there. He winced as if he could read her thoughts. \"It's not what you think.\" He informed her hurriedly. \"Then tell me how it really is?\" She wondered with a biting edge to her tone. \"I made with my dad when I was fifteen.\" He started, pausing only when their food arrived. Giving the waitress a quick thank you, he continued, \"I've been fascinated with computers ever since I touched one when I was five. My dad bought it for work; he was journalist for the New York Times.\" Maya, after setting her lap over her lap, took a bite of her food, sighing happily as a burst of flavor filled her mouth. After swallowing, she asked, \"And your mom?\" \"She's an elementary school teacher. 3rd grade.\" He told her. He grabbed his fork and looked down at his food. Despite him not being a big fan of mac and cheese, it did look really good. He speared some of the pasta and brought it to his mouth. He chewed, processing the taste of it. He could feel Maya staring at him, waiting for him to react, but he gave nothing up. \"So?\" She inquired after he swallowed. He nodded his head, \"Okay. It's pretty good.\" \"Ha! I told you.\" She exclaimed happily causing him to chuckle. \"You said it would ruin all other mac and cheese for me.\" He pointed out, \"I didn't say it did.\" She waved him off, \"Same difference.\" She said with a cheeky smile. He rolled his eyes, going back to his food. \"So, how did this bet become to be?\" She asked after taking another bit of her own dish. \"After that I tried to learn anything I could about computers and how they worked. Once I was older the software and internet caught my eye, and it got me thinking about how they worked.\" He said, \"In my freshman year of high school, I had this assignment for English class. We had to write a paper on where we see our self in ten years. All my classmates wrote how they were either going to be rich, famous, saving the world, or all three.\" \"And you wrote that you would be at Google?\" He nodded, \"There was something about the site, the simplicity of it. Just name, a search bar, and that I'm Feeling Lucky button; it felt like that's where I had to be. I had to try and be a part of something big that was continuously growing.\" His voice had an admired quality to it as he spoke. \"As it developed e-mail accounts and maps and Drive and other apps and features, I just knew that I wanted to work there.\" \"So, what? Your dad didn't approve or something?\" She wondered as she tried to figure out how the bet came to be. \"It's not that he didn't approve, it was more along the lines of him not thinking I would get hired.\" He told her, \"He had always told me to follow my own path and no one else. He knew that Google was where I really wanted to be, but he also knew that it was highly competitive and didn't want me to be disappointed.\" He shrugged, \"He was a realist like that.\" He paused, recalling the day, \"I had just returned home from school and my dad had read that paper and told me his concerns and well I was fifteen year old kid, so I reacted badly.\" He winced remembering his harsh words. \"But my dad was all calm and told me that while it might be impossible it didn't mean I could try.\" \"And the bet was born?\" He nodded looking down at his bowl, half of the food was gone, and he didn't even realize how hungry he had been. \"He said that if I could get a job there, that not only would he get me an apartment, but that he would extremely proud that achieved my goal. Of course, I was only focusing on the apartment part and nothing else.\" \"So, he must be pretty excited that you're in the intern program then?\" He shook his head, \"I wouldn't know.\" He said with a small shrug, \"He died when I was eighteen.\" Maya took in a sharp breath, \"Oh. Oh, Stuart I'm sorry.\" She said kindly. \"It's fine.\" He spoke blandly, waving off her condolences before wincing at his tone and clearing his throat. \"But I-uh-I thought it still go ahead with this. Not for the apartment, but because I want him to be proud of me.\" She covered his hand, much like how he did earlier, and gave it a gentle squeeze, \"He would, Stuart. Just the fact that you made here is reason enough to be proud.\" She told him honestly. He nodded not saying anything else and she removed her hand. They finished their meal in relative silence, only exchanging small random pieces of information about their day. \"So, what happen with Human Resources?\" He asked suddenly after finishing off his meal. She tensed, thinking back to the meeting. \"We talked. I told them about his past behavior and the incident yesterday and that was it.\" She said sharply and he realized that it was something she wasn't ready to talk about. Maya pulled her phone out, nearly wincing at the time. \"Shit.\" She muttered. \"What?\" Stuart asked worriedly, \"Something happened?\" \"No,\" she shook her head, \"I forgot to tell you that you have a team meeting at 5.\" \"Okay and?\" He wondered not seeing the problem. \"It's almost 4:30.\" She told him. \" Damn.\" She snorted softly, \"My thoughts exactly.\" She looked around for their waitress, quickly waving her down. \"Could we please have the check?\" She asked kindly. Once the check was on the table, Stuart tried to take it, but Maya snatched it away from him. \"Come on, Maya. I've got it.\" He insisted. She shook her head, keeping the slip close to her as she grabbed her wallet. \"No, I'll get it. I practically kidnapped you. So, the least I could do is pay for lunch.\" \"But-\" \"No.\" \"Can't-\" \"No.\" \"Hones-\" \" No.\" He gave up, holding his hands out in surrender. \"Fine, but next time it's one me.\" He informed, not realizing what he was saying. She raised an eyebrow as the waitress, grabbed the deck and her debit card. \"Next time, huh?\" She teased gently making him flush once he processed his own words. \"No wait-I mean-I just-\" He stuttered, cheeks turning red with embarrassment. \"I'd like that.\" She cut off, giving him a shy smile. He sighed in relief, a grin forming on his face. Take that, Trent Hatcher! Who says I can't talk to girls? Hour and a Half Later Team Lyle's Shared Office Stuart rushed into the office where the others were waiting for him. \"Sorry! Sorry, I'm late. I know. I got,\" he paused, mind flashing back to Maya and the way she smiled and laughed and actually listened to what he was saying, \" distracted.\" Nick snorted loudly and the younger boy shot him a glare. \"What had you so distracted?\" Neha asked, annoyance seeping from her tone. \" More like who?\" Nick muttered to Billy though everyone could hear him clearly. Stuart blushed as Yo-Yo stared at him with an expression that almost screamed confusion, while Nick and Billy teased him relentlessly, since they knew the reason of him being late, and Neha was annoyed with the three of them. Lyle though was staring down at him, nearly glaring as he tried to put two and two together. There was only one person Nick and Billy would be teasing Stuart about and that was Maya. He recalled the words Nick had said during their first team meeting. Looks like the pretty girl likes Stuart here. \"So, what did you want to talk about Lyle?\" Stuart asked, hoping to get everyone to just stop staring at him. \"The second challenge is coming up and I wanted to go over it with you guys.\" Lyle said eventually, lessening the hard glint in his eye, though it showed up every time he looked over at the boy that his sister seemed smitten with. They discussed the challenge, Neha and Lyle gushing over the fact that it was Harry Potter themed. They went over the rules for Nick and Billy, but they still seemed a little confused, but Stuart honestly couldn't blame them this time as Quidditch was a little difficult to follow if you never read the books. After about an hour, everyone left to get dinner and head back to their rooms for the night. Stuart was the last to leave when Lyle called him back. \"What's going on with you and my sister?\" Lyle asked bluntly after Stuart let the door close. The younger boy blinked having not expected the question. \"Uh-nothing?\" He said uncertainly. \"Because it seems that you two have been spending some time together.\" Lyle pointed out. Stuart shook his head, \"This was the first time we actually spent any time together.\" \"Look Stuart, I'll be frank with you.\" He started, \"I don't like you. Especially since I know what you had said to Maya when you first met her on orientation.\" Stuart winced as he remembered his words, \"And I was wrong about that and she's aware.\" \"Doesn't matter. You insult my sister. You have no idea the hell she's been through these past few years. But,\" Lyle paused, thinking over his words carefully, \"she seems to have grown fond of you and there's a spark in her that I haven't seen in a really long time since she's met you.\" The younger boy looked over to Lyle giving him a searching look. \"Is this the part where you tell that if I hurt her, you'll kill me?\" Lyle shook his head, \"No, but she'll do it herself.\" \"Lyle,\" Stuart began taking a deep breath to calm his nerves, \"I like your sister and I like getting to know her. I don't know if something is going to come of it, but if it doesn't then that will be her choice. I won't pressure her into anything. I know she has a past and demons that she's still working through and I respect that and her.\" He shook his head trying to clear his muddled thoughts, \"I would never intentionally hurt her, but I'm only human and I make mistakes, so I probably will at some point, but I will always try to make it up to her.\" Lyle was quiet for a long moment this time giving Stuart a hard stare as he processed the words. Stuart began to fidget nervously wondering if he screwed things up with Maya before they even really started. \"Okay.\" He nodded. Stuart let out a relieved breath, \"Okay?\" \"I love my sister Stuart. With our mom being our mom , and our dad always away for business, plus they live at home in Boston, so Maya is pretty much all I have. She's my best friend. I want to see her happy and as much as it pains me to say this, I think she could be happy with you. Whether,\" he raised his voice slightly when Stuart started to speak, \"your friends or in a relationship. Besides,\" he shrugged, \"having you in her life this pass month has been really good for her.\" Stuart looked at him curiously, \"What do you mean?\" Lyle shook his head, \"It's not my place to tell. She'll tell you when she's ready.\" \"Maybe someday.\" Stuart repeated Maya's words from earlier. He left shortly after that. The conversation replaying over again in his head making him chuckle once he fully realized that he just got the big brother speech from Lyle Spaulding of all people. On his way to his room, he bumped into Maya, who had the rest of her things and seemed to be heading towards Lyle's office. He flushed, thankful that he got out of there before she could see them talking. \"Hey.\" She greeted with a small smile making his heart skip a beat. \"Hey.\" He echoed. \"You're meeting just get done?\" She asked. He nodded, \"Yeah, a little while ago. Lyle wanted to go over something's with me.\" He told her vaguely. She studied him for a moment, trying to figure what he and her brother could have talked about, but got nothing from his face. \"Alright, well I'll see you later than.\" \"Bye.\" Stuart watched her walk away from him, his heart now pounding from the encounter. He let out a breath, wondering if it was going to feel like this from now on every time he talked to her. He clenched his fists wishing he could talk to his dad. What would you do dad? He asked, sadly looking up at the sky. And there you have it people! Okay, so Homeroom Mac & Cheese is a real place, I've never been because I don't live in California. So anyways, Maya and Stuart get a little close, but she still hasn't told him about her past though he told her about a bet he made with his dad. Also Lyle give Stuart the big brother talk, and impresses Lyle with his answers, even if the older boy doesn't really show it. What do you think Stuart's dad would tell him? Do you think Maya should tell him about her past or wait just a little bit longer? Thoughts? Theories? -CreateAnInsaneWorld ","Summary":" So, I've become absolutely addicted to this movie. As it has my love of comedy that is Vince Vaughn"},{"Movie":"Internship","Title":"Troublemaker","Author":"angelflutest","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9388214","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello everyone! And welcome to the newly updated Troublemaker! Just so everyone knows I got this category up, and I hope I do it justice. I saw it opening night and I have been hooked ever since, and this idea wouldn't let me fully focus on my other stories. So, a quick reminder, I own nothing, except Chris, she's mine and please do not steal her. Without further delay here is my first chapter! Enjoy! \"I'm sorry Chris, there's just nothing we can do.\" \"You can't do this to me! I've been here for almost five years!\" \"I know, and I'm sorry. But you just aren't useful to us anymore.\" Standing up I glared down at the skinny blonde woman that was my boss, her clear brown eyes giving me a level look as my career crashed down around me, taking a calming breath I resisted the urge to punch her in the face. \"Fine, I never liked this job anyway, the customers are rude, and you're a bitch.\" Throwing my ID on her organized wooden desk with a light tap, I walked out screaming profanities as I went before jumping in my starburst blue Dodge Ram 2500, throwing it in gear I took off towards my apartment. Maneuvering my truck around the crowded streets of San Francisco with expert ease, ignoring the looks I was receiving as my truck vibrated from the base in my music. Sitting at a red light I found myself bobbing my head to the music softly, thinking about what I was going to do now that I had no form of income to pay my rent, cringing at the thought of driving home a failure after leaving almost all of my family to come here. Seeing the light turn green I took off, smiling when I turned down the familiar road leading to the large apartment complex that I helped manage, unfortunately for free, I couldn't have my land lord, a very sweet old man who gave me my apartment free for the first three months while I found a job, to pay me. Putting the truck in park I walked up the three steps and into my apartment. Walking through the front door, looking around at the small studio apartment. With the tan walls, and cherry wood floors, my computer sitting on the loveseat in front of the small TV, my 'bedroom' was off to the right hidden by a half wall, to the left was a white door which lead to the restroom. Hearing a soft whine I smiled at the large white dog sitting in front of me. Her big brown eyes shinning with excitement as her giant fluffy tail flapped against the ground her giant head tilting to the side revealing the hot pink, jewel incrusted collar I had bought her for Christmas last year. \"Hey Baby girl, we might have to go back to Oklahoma, if momma can't get a new job.\" Her ears perked at my tone before pushing her head into my hand, smiling I moved my hand higher on her soft head, scratching behind her ear before moving to grab my laptop, clicking through jobsites on Google, feeling a little out of touch as my mind wondered in boredom. \"This is useless Baby.\" She whined as she laid down with her head in my lap looking at the computer screen. \"I don't know what to do.\" Sighing I starred at the white screen for a moment, rolling my eyes as something occurred to me, I was only twenty-one, might as well try an internship. Deciding it couldn't hurt I did a search for the top internships, blinking at the number one company that popped up. \"What about Google?\" Baby barked happily, causing me smile and pat her head lightly while opening the link. \"Well, what the hell? Never hurts to try, right girl?\" Filing out all the information needed, I sent a silent prayer that this would work before setting my computer on the floor and turning on a movie before settling down for the night. So what do we think of the revision? Remember to review guys![Chapter 2] Hello everyone! Oh my God, I can not believe how well this story is going over! Thank you masterkathy, WinchesterDixionBros, jokester12, Pluv1430000, and Jane R. Doe for your reviews! Most questions will be answered in this chapter (I hope so anyway). And this is a Suart/OC fic, eventually. Just thought I would clear that up. With all that said, please enjoy the revision! Waking up the next morning, looking around in a daze after realizing I was in my living room and not my bedroom, the TV playing the news, Baby sleeping on my chest. \"Morning sweetie, get off.\" She blinked at me before hopping off and stretching, her claws barely scratching at the floor, while I sat up sighing as joints popped from sleeping on the hard love seat; glancing at my computer on the floor I noticed my mail icon was bouncing. \"What?\" Clicking on the little icon, screaming with excitement when I read the letter from Google, re reading it a few times to make sure I wasn't dreaming. \"I have an interview Baby!\" She tilted her head before walking over and nudging her empty white with pink polka dots food bowl. Rolling my eyes I turned back to the screen. \"Thanks for the excitement. Let's see…my interview is…at 2 o'clock, so in…crap, one hour.\" Jumping up I hurriedly took a shower, blow-drying my blonde hair so it fell in it's natural waves down to the center or my back, and applying light makeup to my green eyes, shoving my navy blue rimmed glasses on my face before pulling on a nice light pink blouse that complimented my lightly tanned skin. Grabbing my computer I moved it to the table, sitting in front of it a second before the video chat popped up with two people smiling at me. \"Chris?\" \"Yes ma'am.\" The girl smiled at me while the guy nodded. \"I'm Jane and this is Dale. We're going to ask you some questions, ok?\" \"Sounds good.\" They nodded before glancing at a sheet of paper. \"First off, it says here you are not enrolled in college?\" I nodded at the guy, already knowing this was going to come up. \"No sir, I finished my first year, but I could not afford my second year.\" \"So what have you been doing then?\" I smiled at Jane when she nodded when I explained the lack of funding. \"I have been working as a manager at Bass Pro Shops for four and a half years, I was promoted after my first six months from cashier to team lead, then after a year in that position I was promoted to store manager, and I also help my landlord manage his three apartment complexes.\" The pair nodded again, giving me the impression that they liked my interview so far. \"Ok, now, we have a question that most of our interns enjoy. If you were shrunk to three inches and placed in a blender what would you do?\" Blinking at the screen for a moment, thinking through my answer I smiled. \"Well, a blinder only runs for what? Maybe eleven hours? So I would climb up on the little plastic piece in the center and enjoy the ride until it stops then climb out of the blinder, since most blinders are glass it wouldn't take much to climb, or knock over from the inside. And then I would find a way to change back to my normal size, write a book about the experience, sell that book and go on with my life.\" \"Original.\" I covered my mouth trying not to laugh; until Baby decided she was tired of being ignored and propped her front paws onto the table, shoving her face close to the computer. Sighing I pulled her back, quickly apologizing. \"I am so sorry, usually she stays off the table.\" \"Who is she?\" \"This is Baby, I rescued her after she was dumped on the side of the road four years ago.\" Jane awed while Dale typed on his computer. \"Ok, I think we have all the information we need, we will send you an email next week.\" \"I can't wait.\" Clicking off I glared at Baby as she panted, looking at her bowl. \"Fine, fine, I just hope I get this internship.\" Filling her bowl with dog food I went about calling my landlord only to find he wasn't there but his wife, a woman who treated me like a daughter since I moved in, who set an appointment next week for me to talk with her husband and her. Thanking her, again, before hanging up and glancing at the clock on the wall I let out a sigh before making breakfast and turning on my cell phone, not surprised when it started going off with tenants calling with problems. \"And so it begins.\" (A week later) \"Thank you so much Mr. and Mrs. Rose. I really appreciate this.\" \"You're welcome Chris. Good luck.\" I nodded, waving good-bye to my landlord and his wife, his blue eyes shinning as I walked away while Mrs. Rose grabbed her husbands arm, her curly grey hair sitting neatly on her head. They had agreed to wave my rent and expenses if I get the internship. Walking back to my apartment, patting Baby's head before clicking through my emails, smiling when I saw one from Google. \"This is it sweetie.\" Reading through the email I smiled, reading it again to make sure I had read the official email correctly. \"Looks like I have a drive in the morning, I'm going to Google headquarters.\" So what do we think of the revision? Reviews are always welcomed.[Chapter 3] Hello everyone, Here is another revised chapter! I'm still in shock with the response this story is getting. Of course big thanks to Your Yoda I will be, Pluv143000, .7370, Jane R. Doe, Little Black Earrings, Amber Shayde, and WinchesterDixionBros for the reviews! Always appreciated guys, it makes me want to update faster. Ok, won't keep you guys any longer! Please enjoy! Waking up the next morning sending a smile at Baby as she looked up at me, ears perked up as I rolled out of bed. \"Ok Baby, I gotta get ready and head that way, are you gonna be ok without me?\" She whined, burying her head in the blanks causing me to laugh walking into the bathroom, taking a shower, looking in the mirror I thought what to do with my hair before deciding to curl it, applying a light silver eye shadow to my eyes followed by a darker silver eye liner and black mascara. Smiling at my reflection I pulled on the outfit I had decided on the night before. A deep green shirt that hugged my chest perfectly, and charcoal grey dress slacks and hot pink heels. Nodding again in approval as I grabbed my hot pink purse and walked out to see my landlady waiting for me. \"Can I help you Mrs. Rose?\" \"I just thought I could give you a ride dear.\" \"Um, thank you, that's so sweet.\" She nodded, walking over to her 2014 Corvette Stingray. Sliding into the all black leather interior I was in ah at how beautiful the car was. Thanking Mrs. Rose again before stepping out of her car, gaining a lot of looks in the process by the other interns. Looking up at the giant Google headquarters I smiled, mentally preparing myself for whatever I will have to do to get this job. Keeping my steps confident and my head held high I entered the glass building, looking around at the breathtaking entrance for a moment before checking in. Thanking the lady behind the desk I slipped the blue lanyard around my neck, easily hiding the red, yellow, green, and blue beanie in my purse before following the signs to where the other interns had gathered. Shaking my head at the never ending sea of interns, with a light sigh I started making my way through the crowd trying to be careful and not trip on the steps before taking a seat behind a guy wearing a navy blue beanie, black glasses, deep blue blazer, and was fully focused on his cell phone. \"This is insane.\" The guy barely glanced back at me. \"So, what's your name?\" The guy rolled his eyes before sighing and looking back at me. \"Do I look like I want to talk?\" I smirked, his attitude not fazing me after so many years in a management position. \"Well, last I check, the world does not revolve around that little phone of yours.\" \"I'm not here to make friends.\" He turned back to his phone while I laughed lightly, leaning close to his ear, gently placing my chin on his shoulder taking a quick glance at the phone to see he was tweeting about the crowd of people and how much he didn't like it, I couldn't contain the light smirk that crossed my features. \"I'm Chris by the way, be rude to me again and see what happens.\" Standing up I winked at his flabbergasted expression before moving up a few rows, spotting a girl about my age sitting by her self, and looking more than a little bored. Shrugging I walked over, taking a seat next to her. \"Hello.\" \"Hi?\" I laughed at her uncertain tone. \"I'm Chris.\" I offered my hand for her to shake; she smiled before placing her hand in mine. \"I'm Neha.\" \"Nice to meet you. I wasn't expecting this many interns.\" \"Me either.\" Looking around I spotted two older men that were at least twice my age. \"Are they interns?\" \"I think so.\" We watched the pair for a moment before they took a seat in the spot I had been sitting in earlier with the grumpy tweeter. Watching as a man in a white button up shirt called our attention to him. \"And so it begins.\" Neha smirked next to me, both of us sitting a little straighter as the man introduced himself as Roger Chetty. \"I am head of the Google Intern Program. Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship. Oh, no. You will do what we do. And we will watch how well you do it. Now, you represent the finest schools. Your intelligence and achievement is well noted…but to excel at this internship, you're going to need far more than brain power. What you're going to need is Googliness.\" Everyone chuckled at that, until Mr. Chetty cut us off. \"Nothing funny. Googliness. The intangible stuff that made a search engine into an engine for change. Now, you will be divided into teams, and by the end of the summer only one team will be guaranteed a full-time position. The other…95% of you…will not. Now you've been split into several seminars, to acquaint you with our campus and culture. Seminar descriptions have been emailed to each of you.\" At that moment my phone buzzed announcing a new email, no doubt the one he was talking about. \"I would wish you luck, but it's not luck that you need. Get to work!\" I sighed, pulling out my phone and muttering under my breath. \"This is insane.\" \"Very.\" Realizing I had made a quick friend in Neha as we looked at each other's emails. Quickly realizing we had the same stations to go to. \"Yay, let's go.\" We smiled before walking into a room with a screen, smirking to myself when I spotted the familiar beanie of the boy from earlier. Looking at Neha I gave her an apologetic smile. \"I'll be right back, I just want to say hi to a friend of mine, save me a seat?\" \"Sure.\" Taking careful steps I silently slid in next to him, deliberately bumping elbows causing his fingers to slide across the little screen. He sighed and looked at me. \"Hey partner.\" \"Can you really not leave me alone?\" \"Nope, you're just to much fun to not ignore. Just a warning my friend, you need to relax just a little. This is supposed to be fun, keep up the attitude and something might just happen to you.\" He rolled his eyes, opting not to reply to my remark as I elbowed his arm again before walking over to where Neha sat a few rows back. \"This should be fun.\" Remember to review guys![Chapter 4] Hello everyone! Got another revised chapter for you! Quick shout out to IllusionsOfBeauty, WinchesterDixionBros, Pluv143000, Jane R. Doe, and heeyiitspaige! I love all of yall and everyone who is following and/or favoriteing Troublemaker. Just a quick little thing, normally when I have an issue with someone I just PM them, but this person is a guest so I can't do that. ILOVEMYH, as much as I appreciate the reviews, this is NOT a Stuart/Neha fic, they will not be together as a couple in this fic. Just wanted to remind you of that. To the rest of you, thank you so much for the support and enjoy the new chapter! Watching as Mr. Chetty looked at us before clicking a button on the remote he was holding causing the screen to flash. \"Now I recognize that Google is not a conventional workplace. Having said that, we have rules. I'm going to ask you a series of questions. You're going to raise the green paddle to indicate yes, and the red paddle to indicate no. So, let's begin.\" I rolled my eyes as the picture on the screen turned, relaxing in my seat a little, moving my phone so it sat on my leg. \"Having a beer with your boss.\" Everyone but the two older interns raised the red paddle, smirking I glanced at Neha. \"Well, I wouldn't get a beer with him, he doesn't seem very fun.\" It took everything Neha had not to laugh at me, obviously she appreciated my humor unlike my old boss. Looking up I noticed the conversation going on between Mr. Chetty and the two interns was catching my attention. \"Some of you are under 21.\" \"Some of us aren't under 21, so if you want to grab a cold one with me, I'm happy to do that with you.\" \"I will not be \"grabbing a cold one\" with you.\" \"You get high?\" \"I don't get high.\" \"Okay. I'm not judging. Just saying. People do it.\" I blinked at the taller of the two interns, intrigued by his thought process, before covering my mouth to stifle a laugh as Neha nudge me to keep me quiet, watching as the intern leaned close to my new 'friend' in the beanie, I could only imagine what he was saying as Mr. Chetty continued. \"Now, I recognize that Google is not a normal work place, but it is a work place none the less. Now, let's try this again…Dating a fellow intern.\" Again all the red paddles went up except the same ones as earlier. \"Do these two really not get how this works?\" \"Apparently not.\" Smirking I watched Mr. Chetty again. \"This is Google, not Match dot com.\" \"Chetty, excuse me, what about full-time employee. Say, management level but not a direct supervisor. Great eyes, and a severity to her look that is surprisingly sexy. What's the policy on that?\" At the look Chetty gave him I shook my head. \"No? That's frowned upon also?\" \"So we'll say no to love?\" \"We say no to love yes.\" I was taken a back by the blonde's slight accent, leaving me to wonder where these two were from. I looked at Neha. \"Not like there's anyone here worth dating anyway.\" She nodded in agreement while looking around at the guys, rolling my eyes for a moment before turning back to the front. \"Taking food home from the office.\" Raising the red paddle before sitting back. \"Wonder what they'll say this time.\" \"Shush Chris.\" I laughed, grabbing my phone as I could hear Mr. Chetty getting annoyed with the intern, looking at some pictures I smiled at one of Baby when she was a puppy. \"Who's that?\" I smiled at Neha. \"This is Baby, when she was a puppy, want to see what she looks like now?\" \"Sure.\" I smiled showing her the one I took last night. \"Wow, she's beautiful.\" \"Thanks.\" Looking up we realized the seminar was over. \"Well, that was fun.\" \"Very.\" \"We pick teams tomorrow right?\" \"Right.\" I smiled as we walked to the entrance, sighing when I realized Mrs. Rose wasn't there to pick me up and I would have to walk. \"I'll see you tomorrow, Neha.\" \"Yeah, see you tomorrow.\" Nodding I started walking away, spotting my 'friend' on my way out I smirked and waved at him as he threw me an obviously half hearted glare I simply smiled at him before leaving. \"Hey Baby, I'm back.\" She whined and danced around me happily. \"It's going to be interesting, that's all I can say.\" What do we think of the slight revision on this one? Remember to review![Chapter 5] Hello everyone! You guessed it! Another revised chapter! Hearing my phone blaring I sighed before turning the alarm off as Baby laid her head on my chest and licked my face. \"Alright, I'm awake.\" Her eyes lit up before she stood up and walked over to her food dish. \"I see ya girl, I see ya.\" She sat down and waited while I filled her bowl before turning to my closet and pulling on a pair of black skinny jeans, a tight fitting, teal, V neck knitted top that showed a fair amount of skin, slipping on a pair of grey knee high boots before walking into the bathroom and quickly applying mascara before fluffing up my hair and pulling my glasses on, walking out of the apartment I yelled my goodbyes to Baby. Clicking through my iPod before finding something to listen to as I made my way to my truck and taking off towards Google. Walking over to Neha with a smile on my face. \"Wow, you look cute.\" \"So do you.\" We laughed as we took our seats, looking around at all the other interns for a moment before Neha nudged me. \"Looks like your friend's here.\" Looking where she pointed I laughed. \"I should go say hello, only to be polite of course.\" \"Of course.\" With a simple nod I stood up and slowly made my way over to my favorite intern in the navy beanie. Taking a calm seat next to him I waited until he noticed me. \"What?\" I faked a gasp of shock at his annoyed tone. \"Such attitude towards a lady.\" He snorted, his eyes never straying from the little screen in front of him. \"You're a lady? That's shocking.\" I rolled my eyes and nudged him. \"Don't pretend like you don't like me.\" He turned to me to reply but I was already on my feet and making my way towards Neha when another intern stopped me. \"Well, hello there. I don't think I met you yesterday.\" I blinked at his almost to thick British accent. \"And who would you be?\" \"Graham, and you would be?\" I smirked, watching the intern in mild curiosity, about to answer until his eyes drifted down the front of my shirt and stayed on my breast for longer than was neither necessary nor appropriate. \"Well, since your going to act like a pig, I think I'll keep my name to myself.\" \"Feisty. I like it.\" I scoffed at him, unaware of the adorable brown eyes watching us from behind, before side stepping him and walking back to take my seat. \"Who was that?\" I glanced at Neha for a moment. \"Said his name was Graham, he's a pig.\" She laughed and we fell into a light conversation while waiting for the day to start. \"Welcome to day two! I am Sid. Eighth year Googler. You guys are new Googlers. Thus, you're Nooglers!\" Everyone laughed for a moment before Sid continued. \"Now, this place is all about community and collaboration, so you'll be working in teams from here on out.\" Chetty walked over and yanked the mike away from Sid. \"You have five minutes. Pick your teams.\" Keeping close to Neha we tried to team up with other people only to be ignored, seeing Graham walking our way I nudged her off to the side. \"I'll be in any group except one with him.\" She agreed, and in the blink of an eye, everyone was in a group and our five minutes was up. Looking around I noticed a Japanese kid, my favorite intern, and the two older interns, who were talking to one of, what I could only assume to be, team manager. \"Really? The leftover team?\" Neha looked around and noticed the same thing as me before we were yelled at to follow the older interns; walking into a separate room everyone chose their own spots to sit. Sitting next to Neha, deciding since we were the only girls on the team sticking together would be a good idea. I looked over at our team manager as he approached us. \"Alright! Let's get some meet and greet going up in this heezy! I'm Lyle and it's pretty much wysiwig-what you see is what you get. Been here at the Goog for four years. Working on seven projies en este momento.\" I heard one of the older interns make a comment about the seven projects but wasn't really paying attention. \"Hey they ask and I do's it. What can I say? I'm a people pleaser. 'Specially the ladies, my Mercedes! It's all good in Lyle's hood. Ya heard.\" \"Ah yeah, is Lyle always going to be referring to himself in the third person? 'Cause if he is, I might want to punch Lyle in the face.\" Looking around I noticed my favorite intern was practically glaring at Lyle. \"Okay, tough but fair, good note. Lyle's still a little nervous. Lyle's a first-time manager. Gonna stop doing that, gonna cut it out. Keeping it to first and second person. Who's next?\" At that the Japanese kid stood up. \"My name is Yo-Yo Santos.\" The older intern with the brown hair raised his hand for a high five, causing Yo-Yo to flinch. \"Yo-Yo, easy buddy I come in peace.\" \"Yo-Yo did you get beat up a lot in school?\" \"I was homeschooled by my mom.\" \"Did you get beat up a lot in homeschool?\" I scoffed, finding the older interns funny. \"Well, discipline is a very important part of growth. My mother was actually a very nurturing person, for example she provided me selflessly with the milk of her bosom until I was seven years old.\" My mouth dropped open before I quickly closed it with a soft click. \"So it's like you're tying your shoe, you're climbing trees, you're blowing up fireworks, and then you got mouth on Mom.\" Yo-Yo nodded. \"Breastfeeding leads to a higher I.Q.\" The blonde decided to speak up. \"Actually, the science isn't quiet definitive on that. I was bottle-fed. It never slowed me down. Vitamins are vitamins, whether they come from a teat or a baba.\" \"Wrong.\" Everyone turned to my favorite intern as he looked at us. \"Sorry, what was that?\" \"Wrong. The teat or baba thing, it's wrong. I just Googled it. So you're wrong. Oh, yeah, I'm Stuart.\" I smirked now that I knew his name. \"Well it's a pleasure to meet you Stewie. You know, you can't trust everything you read on.\" \"The Journal of American Medical Association? Sounds pretty trustworthy. Says that breast milk has more nutrients, and that those nutrients are more easily digested and absorbed. Your confusion's understandable, you were bottlefed.\" \"Boys! We're a team give it a rest. I'm Chris by the way, I know more about team work than any of you, and that's all any of you need to know for now.\" Neha laughed while the boys looked a little taken back as I took my seat again. Watching as Neha stood up. \"Okay guys, I for one, am happy to have two strapping, mature gentlemen on the team.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, I'm Neha Patel. And, oh, my God, you guys would make the best Luke and Han.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Oh, \"Star wars\" cosplay.\" \"Cosplay?\" \"Costume play! You know. People dress up as their favorite anime or movie character. I'd be slave girl Leia. Metal bikini top. Metal G-string panty. High-heeled leather boots. Of course I'm chained at the neck. Not too constricted, but just enough to make things interesting.\" \"The neck constriction's interesting.\" \"Yeah a few of us get together and whatever happens happens.\" Reaching my leg over I nudged Neha to get her attention. \"Hon, back on topic.\" She nodded. \"Oh, but workwise, your skills aren't really relevant here or really in this millennium, so stay out of our way. We'll do this shit on our own.\" She smiled and sat back down, the blonde speaking back up. \"Well, I'm loving this friction. You know why? It's how you get a fire started. I'm Nick, this is my pal, Billy, and despite what you may think, we're just like you, running down a dream.\" Lyle stood up, attempting to get our team moral up. \"All right! Team Lyle!\" We just looked at him. \"Okay, we'll workshop that. It's in beta. Okey-doke! Translate lecture is in 15 minutes.\" Shaking our heads everyone stood up and followed Lyle into a classroom. Taking a seat between Neha and Stuart. A smile appearing as I pulled out my computer and started taking notes, more focused on learning over messing with my teammate. So what did we think? I know, not a whole lot was changed in this chapter, but there will be changes later. Remember to review and I will update when the movie FINALLY comes out on DVD in one month![Chapter 6] I am back! I literally bought the DVD and spent three days writing and revising. If you haven't seen the revisions, just so everyone knows I add some to chapter 3 through 5. Of course a huge thank you to baptizedatheist, Taffyrose, LapisLazuliRose, and Amber for reviewing! I really do appreciate it guys! Enjoy the new chapter! I will try to update twice a week! As we were about to continue 'getting to know each other' Mr. Chetty sent us a video message with the information for the first challenge. \"Good morning interns! Today marks the first of several challenges through which your team shows their merits. While dogfooding a new product, a number of Googlers reported a bug that disabled their audio. All two million lines of code are in the source files. Your job? Find the bug.\" At the end of the message we jumped into action, grabbing dry erase markers we stated writing down formulas and trying to figure out what to do while Billy and Nick were yelling random words back and forth and was starting to get on all of our already frazzled nerves. \"Guys! Stop! You are not helping.\" They looked at me and tried to argue when Stuart spoke up. \"Yeah, and that's a Sharpie by the way genius.\" I rolled my eyes as Billy tried to wipe it off and Neha stood up. \"Look guys, I'm sorry, but you're not helping. You're saying a lot of words really fast that mean nothing to find the bug, we need to scan the user codes and review the codes and find the programmer's mistake. It's the only way.\" \"Except what if it's not the only way? Okay, you said someone programmed it. That means someone in this building wrote that code.\" \"A human being!\" I shared a look with Stuart as we sighed and watched the pair in annoyance. \"Let's give him a name, and call him Tony. Let's say Tony likes kayaking. All of a sudden Me and Nick become friends with Tony. We're throwing a few beers back, do some kayaking with my main man Tony. Tony's bombed on the open water. Next thing you know, we're gabbing about audio bugs!\" \"Yeah, I actually think it's a great idea.\" I turned and looked at Stuart, obviously he had a plan. \"Good! Great!\" \"Finally!\" \"Dark and stormy feeling us!\" \"Yeah, no, feeling you big time, buddy.\" \"Terrific.\" \"In fact, why don't the two of you go and find the programmer?\" I smirked and nodded. \"Chris, who's our man?\" I looked to my left and spotted a figurine. \"His name is Charles Xavier.\" Stuart quickly covered a laugh as the pair fell for it and Neha joined in. \"He's a professor. At Stanford. Yeah, just a few minutes away, really.\" Stuart jumped back in. \"He's in a wheelchair.\" \"Got it, Stanford, wheelchair, what else?\" \"Oh, he's bald!\" \"May be with his best friend, who wears a metal helmet.\" I elbowed Stuart, trying to keep this believable, everyone started talking at once, finally I spoke up. \"He's British.\" \"British? My ear we're done.\" \"Keep searching. Think fly, think bug. I promise you this somehow intersects with Goldblum.\" Watching them leave we all sighed and went back to work. Ten minutes later we had our jobs assigned and Lyle was checking in with Yo-Yo. \"Yo to the Yo, where are we in insuring it wasn't a networking issue?\" \"Confirmed there was no packet loss. Almost done checking the encryption.\" \"I'm sorry. Almost? Either you're done or you're not. You can't be almost pregnant.\" I rolled my eyes, deciding to focus on the job at hand instead of responding. \"Yeah, she would know guys.\" \"You know what? Why don't you Google \"asshole\", asshole.\" Turning I was about to shut them all up when Yo-Yo started talking to himself. \"She's right. Not good enough, Yo-Yo. Get it together.\" I raised an eyebrow as he pulled a hair out of his eyebrow. \"What the hell was that?\" \"I was punishing myself for my inferior performance.\" \"Wow ok, that's good, that's great, that ones crazy. Somewhere there's a geek orgy you're late for.\" \"Yeah well somewhere there's a micro-phallus convention you're late for.\" \"Does your mind just immediately go to a penis joke?\" \"Will you two stop? Lord it's like dealing with a bunch of children.\" \"Something you would know about.\" I growled and stood up, easily slapping Stuart across the face, he blinked in shock, Lyle was about to say something when our computers flashed, announcing the winner to be Graham's team. \"Great, all that arguing and we still lost.\" Sitting with the group for lunch, somehow getting stuck next to Stuart, who still had a red mark on his cheek, at the table with Neha across from me. \"Wonder when they'll be back?\" \"The fact that they fell for it, I don't care.\" I glared at Stuart before opening my laptop, a picture of Baby and I in front of our small, overly decorated; white tree surrounded by presents greeted me. Smiling lightly I checked around on Facebook when Nick and Billy walked over to us. Guilt gripped me as I turned back to my screen, not wanting to be rude to our oldest team members again. Seeing my email icon flashed I shrugged and clicked on it, excitement filling me when I realized it was from my uncle, asking if I still wanted to work for him. \"What's up?\" I looked up to see Neha looking at me, not realizing Stuart was looking at my screen in curiosity until I closed the program, leaving him to look at Baby in barely concealed curiosity. \"It's nothing.\" She gave me a disbelieving look, looking back at my screen I made a mental note to reply back to him when I went home. So what do we think of the new chapter? Remember to review![Chapter 7] I'm back! How is everyone! I miss you guys! Here is a new chapter! \"Well, this should be interesting.\" Neha laughed as we pulled our hair back to get ready for the game. Pulling my hair back into a high ponytail and slipping on a pink headband I was ready. \"Come on, don't want to be late.\" She nodded and we walked out the door and outside to meet with our teammates and grab our red brooms before running on to the field. Annoyed when I spotted Graham on the opposing field. \"Great.\" \"All right, teams, welcome to the Quidditch pitch. Let's have a good clean match, Nooglers.\" Sid blew the whistle and we reached to our side of the field, quickly forming a less than enthusiastic huddle. \"Okay, rules. The beaters toss the bludgers at the chasers then get the quaffle through the ring. No blagging, no blatching, no bumphing, no haversacking I don't want to see any quaffle-pocking. No imperius curses no confundus charms. In the unlikely event of a Dementor attack, use a Patronus charm. I recommend the stag but that's a personal decision.\" I sighed looking at Billy and Nick, who had no idea what Lyle was talking about. \"Lyle, Lyle, these two beautiful idiots have no idea what you're talking about. Use your muggle words. Come on.\" Lyle looked over at them. \"Come on Lyle you're making me feel like I'm back in math class. Okay? You got a couple of savants here with eye-hand coordination. Just say \"game on\" and let us play!\" Stuart rolled his eyes and I glared at him. \"Fair enough. Version 2.0. Peg them with the kickballs before they throw the volleyball through the hoop. Brooms in people. Hufflepuff on three.\" Grinning we yelled Hufflepuff before taking our positions on the end of the field. And just like that the game started, and before we knew it Graham's team scored and we couldn't get ahold of the ball. Finally Lyle somehow managed to grab it, screaming he tossed it at me, quickly looking around I spotted Stuart, who was completely open. Throwing it at him, I tried not to laugh when I nailed him in the head. \"What the hell was that?\" \"Why don't you try looking up and giving a shit!\" He tried to mimic me only for some one on Graham's team to hit him with a ball. Finally Billy called a time out. \"It's over.\" \"Yeah our team's a joke.\" I raised an eyebrow at Stuart as he threw his beanie on the ground. \"Well, I ain't laughing. Are you, Billy?\" \"Hell no.\" \"Listen we need to get our minds right and start believing.\" \"This reminds me of a little girl who had to start believing. A little girl from a steel town who had the dream to dance. No one believed in that welder girl, but she believed in herself.\" I sighed and looked at them. \"Are you talking about \"Flashdance\"?\" \"Damn right I am.\" Shaking my head I quit listening, that was one of my favorite 80's movies, Billy was inspiring the team and that's all that mattered. Coming up with a plan we came back from our time out. Somehow managing to tie the game, causing some random guy in a gold body suit to run out onto the field. \"It's the Golden Snitch!\" \"Who the fuck is this now!\" I turned and looked at the guys, catching eyes with Graham. \"Get the tennis ball and we win, let's go!\" The three of us started running the same time as Graham, I heard Nick and Billy go down somewhere behind me, just as I was about to reach the ball I felt Graham grab my broom, keeping a tight grip on the little prop I was a in shock when I felt my self falling forward and pain shooting up my ankle and my back as Graham stepped on me to tackle the Golden Snitch. Groaning I rolled over and grabbed my left ankle in pain, tears spiking up as I tried to move it. \"You alright Chris?\" Looking up I was surprised to see Stuart offering me a hand up, a concern look on his face. \"Yeah, bastard made me wipe out.\" He nodded, helping up and allowing me to use him as a crutch as we hobbled over to the group. \"You alright?\" \"Yeah, I'll be fine.\" Everyone nodded before turning to go back inside. \"Can I go home now?\" Lyle laughed and nodded, unwinding myself from Stuart after realizing how close we were I smiled and thanked him before limping out to my car. Sliding in I drove to work, slowly relaxing my ankle and praying I would be able to dance on it tonight. So what do we think? Remember to review![Chapter 8] Hi everyone! A big thanks to both Taffyrose and Gryffindor4eva for reviewing! I hope everyone enjoys the new chapter! Ignoring my phone as it continued to buzz with text from my entire team, all asking why I wasn't at Google today, the reason being, I was finishing my training at my uncles club so I could dance tonight. \"Remember new girl it's twirl hip.\" \"Yes ma'am.\" I glared at the woman teaching me some moves, she was older than me by about five years and has worked for my uncle since she was eighteen. Finally after 4 grueling hours of practice I was sore and ready to get dressed for tonight. Walking backstage I smiled at the other dancers before striping down and changing into my first outfit. A purple pushup bra, matching boy short panties, and two purple garters sitting high on my thighs. Taking a calming breath I decided to check my phone as I waited for time to pass. I had two dances tonight since it was my first time on the stage. Neha: Where are you? The boys are getting worried Hello? You can't drop off the face of the earth. Well, since your not here, our new challenge is to create an app Lyle: Where are you? We made an excuse for you when Chetty came checking around. Yo-Yo: Are you coming in today? Billy: Hey sweetie, where are you? Stu is getting anxious without you here Are you ok? Nick: Hey, we miss you The group would love to hear from you Everyone misses you Specially Stu Stuart: It's not good for you to miss a day Are you coming in? I can't believe you left us with the idiots We could use your help on this challenge Billy keeps pitching Exchangogram aka instagram Meet us for dinner? I sighed, feeling bad that I was letting my team down, just as my cue started my phone buzzed one more time from Stuart At a club you would have enjoyed if you were here. Shaking my head I put my phone down and took my position as 'Jump' by Flo Rida started, swinging to the beat I made my entrance, spinning with ease and dropping to the floor before popping back up and continuing with my semi complicated dance, only pausing when I saw my team standing in the entranceway, cursing under my breath I forced myself to finish the dance as one of the older girls sucked on Stuarts finger and lead the group to one of the booths. Sighing I shimmied upstairs while another girl came down, sitting in front of my mirror I decided to mess with Stuart. Chris: Enjoying yourself? I placed my phone down to change into a bikini for the tank, hearing my phone buzz I smiled and picked it up. Stuart: She's alive! Where are you? Chris: Backstage Stuart: Backstage? I laugh and nodded while poking my head outside to see Stuart getting a lap dance, shaking my head I grabbed my phone again taking a picture from my spot and sending it to Stuart, laughing at his reaction as he looked around. Stuart: If you're backstage come out and join us. Chris: I can't, I'm about to go in the tank, want to join me? I was laughing at the lack of response. Walking into the club I quickly found my uncle, tapping his shoulder I smiled up at him. \"What's up sweetie?\" \"I know I just started, but my team from Google is here, can they come into the tank with me?\" He sighed and looked down at me. \"This will make up for all the missed birthday parties and graduations.\" He sighed and nodded. \"Fine, only this once though.\" Grinning I hugged him and walked over to my group as they took another shot of tequila. \"Hey guys.\" Everyone looked up and Stuarts mouth dropped open a little before he closed it. \"You work here?\" I nodded at Nick. \"I finished my training this morning, that's why I wasn't at Google today.\" There was a chorus of 'ohs' before I turned to Neha, Yo-Yo who swayed in his seat a little, and Stuart. \"I got the OK for you guys to join me in the tank. Come on.\" Neha cheered and quickly stood and followed after me, closely followed by Yo-Yo and Stuart bringing up the rear. Opening the door I smiled as the girl that was in it stepped out so we could step in, grabbing the pole it didn't take long to lose control as 'Wild Ones' by Flo Rida started blaring through the speakers. Seeing Stuart looking nervous I rolled my eyes and grinded up against him before going back to swinging around the pole. A few seconds later Stuart joined me on the pole while Neha grabbed the one next to us, smirking we let the music take over as everyone danced. Finally the song ended and we went to find Billy and Nick, thankfully my shift was technically over. Walking over to the bar we saw Lyle standing next to one of the girls and a small group of over dressed men talking smack. \"This clubs big enough, yall go one way we'll go another and enjoy our evenings, alright?\" The blonde smirked at me before nodding, smiling I turned to go back to the group when the fight started. The blonde grabbed me and Stuart punched the guy, the lights going to their strobe setting as the two groups attacked each other. Finally security stepped in and carried us out of the club, laughing I climbed onto the bus, not bothered that I was still in my bathing suit. Sitting in the seats I was laughing as Neha handed me a bottle she somehow stole from behind the counter. \"You need to drink like the rest of us.\" \"Gladly.\" Pulling Stuarts jacket closer, which I stole after it dried, I sighed and looked at the view in front of us, it was early morning and we were looking at the bridge. \"You know.\" I looked over at Billy as he smiled down at me, Neha sat on his other side while Nick talked to Stuart off to the side and Yo-Yo was lying on a bench. \"Know what?\" \"Stuart was depressed with you being gone yesterday.\" I looked up at him in shock. \"He was?\" He nodded and Neha chimed in. \"You two would make a cute couple, go ask him out.\" \"What? No.\" \"Yes, go.\" I glared at her before looking over at him to see him looking over at me before turning back to Nick. Smiling I pulled the jacket a little closer before standing up and walking over to one of the benches and sitting by myself I watched the cars on the bridge before smiling when Stuart took a seat next to me, leaning over I laid my head on his shoulder, smiling as he stiffened for a moment before relaxing and wrapping his arm around me. \"How about a deal?\" He looked down at me. \"If we win this challenge, you have to take out on a real date. Deal?\" \"Deal.\" Settling down we relaxed until Lyle walked up while texting on his phone. \"Lyle! Looks like you hit it off with Saffron tonight.\" \"I'm texting her that I love her and sending a picture I just took of little Lyle when he made pee in the bushes. Look, he's winking.\" Shaking my head I turned and watched Lyle show Billy the pic. \"Lyle, that's a horrible idea. Don't do that. You're drunk off your ass.\" I heard Stuart scoff behind me. \"I appreciate your concern, but I'm flying, baby.\" He giggled at us, Billy spoke up trying to reason with the drunk. \"Lyle, you're not flying. Look, what's 17 squared?\" \"289, why?\" \"Give me a harder question than that.\" \"Try um, maybe square root of seventeen.\" I smiled back at Stuart. \"Good one.\" He smiled when Lyle couldn't answer the question. \"That's the app. That's the app we should do.\" I grinned, catching on to what Nick was thinking. \"A quiz question you have to answer before you can send a drunk text, email, or phone call. Something to protect you from yourself.\" \"That's good. Can we do that?\" \"Hells, yeah!\" \"I can program the shit out of that on the ride home.\" We all looked back at Yo-Yo before grinning and deciding to go back to Google and finish off the app. So what did we think? Remember to review![Chapter 9] Oh my God guys I am solo sorry! Somehow this story was thrown to the back burner of my list! A big shout out to Gryffindor4eva, emily, DayDreamer1122, Untilweburnout, Kira Tsumi, charisma26, and the guest for reviewing! Again I don't know how it happened but please enjoy the new chapter guys! Leaning against the ottoman Stu was laying on, a coffee cup sitting next to me as everyone was recovering from their hangovers. \"The whole world looks like a giant pinwheel of death.\" I laughed and patted his arm. \"That's the price of making memories, Stewie.\" I chuckled at Nick while sipping my coffee, listening to Yo-Yo complaining about his liver hurting. \"Astonishingly.\" We jumped and looked up at Mr. Chetty as he walked towards us. \"Your app received ten times more downloads than any other team's. It appears you won your first challenge.\" Billy clapped his hands while the rest of us tried to hide the pain we were in. \"How about it?!\" \"Congratulations.\" I twisted my face when Yo-yo vomited in a trashcan, Chetty giving him a weird look. \"He get's overexcited.\" I smiled at Nick as he covered for Yo-yo, Chetty muttered 'lovely' before walking off and leaving us alone. Leaning my head back I smiled when Stu nudged me. \"Guess I owe you a date.\" \"Yes you do.\" \"Baby how do I look?\" Baby whined and buried her head in my blanket. \"That's not a comfort.\" Spinning in front of the mirror I smiled as the pink and black dress swayed around me, hearing the doorbell ring I grinned as Baby's head popped up and ran to the front door, whining lowly as I opened the door and grabbed her collar before she could jump on Stu as he smiled at me. \"Hey.\" \"Hey.\" \"You ready?\" I nodded and told Baby to go to bed before shutting the door and smiling at Stu. \"You look great.\" \"Thanks, where are we going?\" Stu just smiled at me before walking back to the cab that was waiting on us. Sliding into the backseat I smiled at Stu as we fell into conversation all the way to the restaurant. Which was surprisingly nice, yet casual enough that we fit in, thanking our hostess as she showed us to our booth table. Sitting across from Stu, we fell into silence. \"So, that ball of fluffy was your dog?\" I laughed and nodded. \"That was Baby.\" He smiled and we fell into conversation again, it didn't take long for us to get our food, eat and leave. Walking to the park, I looked up at the stars until I felt something warm wrap around my hand, smiling I walked a little closer to Stu as I gently squeezed his hand. Finally we made it back to my apartment, pausing outside the door I smiled up at him. \"I had fun Stu.\" \"Me too.\" I watched as he turned to walk away, rolling my eyes I grabbed his wrist, causing him to turn and look at me as I leaned up and pressed my lips to his. He stood in shock for a moment before kissing me back, giggling I pulled away. Reaching up I grabbed his beanie and slipped it on my head before opening my door. \"If you want this back, you're gonna have to come in and get it.\" I winked at his dumbstruck expression, watching as it dawned at him what I was saying before smiling and walking into my apartment, bending down he kissed me again as I slammed the door shut. Again I am so sorry about not updating! I have the last few chapters written and I will update everyday until it's finished so be on the look out! As always reviews are greatly appreciated![Chapter 10] True to my word I'm updating today! A quick shout out to MsRose91, charisma26, and Taffyrose for reviewing! Enjoy the new chapter! I sighed as I sat next to Neha as we waited for Chetty to start telling us about our next challenge. \"So, why is Stewie grinning like a child?\" I blushed and opened my computer. \"You two had a date last night right? How'd it go?\" She continued to look at me as I grinned and Stuart reached over and laced our fingers together, Neha giggled at us. \"Did you two?\" \"Maybe.\" She gasped in surprise as Chetty started talking, successfully distracting my friend from her interrogation. \"Only two challenges remain. After which, a mere handful of you will be offered full-time employment. Now, the next challenge is manning the Google helpline. This is one of the most difficult jobs we have…combining both customer relations and product fluency. You will be judged on both. This…is a very tight race right now. I suggest you study up.\" Chetty walked away and I grinned. \"Easy challenge.\" As we moved to walk back to our little office area Neha grabbed me and we hung back. \"So? How was it?\" I blushed again, telling her about the date, and about inviting Stu into my apartment for the night. Entering the small room I took my seat at my computer as I started reading the information I needed to know for the challenge. A small smile appearing on my face as Stu reached his leg over and knocked it against mine, shaking my head I lightly knocked it back before going back to the screen as Lyle walked in. \"Alright, let's drill it and kill it. Authorization failure with Google Drive. Neha.\" \"Permission's probably changed. Request document access.\" Lyle was happy and moved on. \"Bam! Chrome connectivity. Chris.\" I barely glanced at him. \"Unselect proxy server for your LAN.\" \"Nice! Billy, I'm locked out of my Google Wallet account.\" Hearing Billy's pause before answering I turned to look at him. \"Is that under Gmail or Wallet Help?\" Lyle acted like he was talking on the phone. \"I don't know, sir. That's kind of what I called you for.\" Billy spun around to look at Lyle. \"Right, I'm terrific on phones. I can sell prosciutto to a rabbi, and I have.\" Yo-Yo spoke up. \"Except you're not selling anything.\" Stu spoke up as well. \"Yeah, Billy, you can't bullshit your way through this one. I mean the only way to nail this challenge is to study. You just-you just gotta do it man.\" Billy turned back to the screen. \"Then study up is what I'm going to do.\" Turning back to the screen I paused as Billy spoke up, immediately becoming concerned for our team. \"Let me ask you, is there a blanket statement I could say…that could apply to literally anything?\" Shaking my head I spoke up. \"Billy, this isn't selling, this is tech support.\" I rolled over to his computer and pointed to the little button on the screen. \"Just click this button and read, you'll get it, we'll help you, don't worry.\" He nodded as I pushed back over to my chair and continued to work. \"That was nice.\" Glancing at Stu I smiled. \"It's what I do.\" Sitting in front of the computer screen I looked over at Stu. \"Good luck.\" \"You too.\" I giggled as Neha shook her head at us. \"Are you two even trying to hide your relationship?\" I shook my head as Stu grinned. \"We're not stupid enough to get caught by Chetty, but most of the interns have figured it out.\" I motioned to Graham who was watching us with poorly suppressed rage. Hearing Chetty clear his voice we looked over at him. \"Good morning. Welcome to the Google Helpline. You will man the phones for one hour. Before you begin you must log in, when your hour is up you must click the log file icon, accessing your account, so we can review your work later. The Helpline…is open.\" And just like that the phones went off, and everyone was talking at once. Spinning in my chair I continued talking to my customer when Stu tossed a stress ball at me, hiding my laugh I gave him a look as he talked to his customer. Tossing the ball back at him we continued to do our work while tossing the stupid green and red ball to the other until Chetty yelled time's up, causing Billy to speak up. \"So soon? I was just getting warmed up!\" Our team high fived each other as Chetty told us to submit our log files. Clicking the blue button I smiled at Stu. \"That was awesome.\" He nodded, until we heard Billy saying that his button was grey and not blue, turning I looked at his screen and sure enough it was still grey. \"Did you not hear my opening remarks?\" I looked at Chetty as he walked over to us, Billy muttering that he heard most of them. \"I was very clear that you have to log into your account so I could review your work later.\" I shook my head, knowing we were officially screwed I stood up and left the room. Walking back to our meeting spot I sat down in a chair and let the feeling of defeat set in, wiping at my eyes I was reminded how much I needed this job. Hearing the door open I turned and spotted Stu as he took a seat next to me, wrapping an arm around my waist, allowing me to burry my head in his neck. \"I need this job Stu, if we don't get it I have to go back home a failure.\" He nodded, kissing my hair as the rest of our team walked in, minus the screw up himself. Everyone took a seat around us, ignoring how Stu and I were sitting. \"Great. Another win for Team Graham.\" I sighed against Stu as Yo-Yo stated the obvious. \"There's only one challenge left. Even if we're perfect, it won't be enough.\" Neha sighed. \"We had them, too.\" Nick spoke up. \"We did, but it's just a little hiccup, a little adversity.\" Stu tightened his grip on me for a moment. \"Nick, come on. Billy's a great guy, but he kind of blew it for us today.\" Just as Nick was about to defend our teammate Billy walked in. \"The kids are right, Nick. I just wanted to come by and let you know…that today on the phones…it's my fault. And, uh…he was right when he said you deserved better. I'm really sorry that I cost you.\" He walked away and we sighed, Nick following after him. Sitting up I looked around. \"Let's call it a day huh? It's been a long one.\" What do we think? One more chapter to go guys![Chapter 11] Alright! This is the final chapter guys! I just want to thank everyone that reviewed, favorited, and/or followed this story! Enjoy! Looking up at Chetty we didn't know what we were going to do, Billy had never showed this morning. \"Ladies and Gentlemen it has been an impressive summer. And one challenge remains. Sales. Over a million companies advertise with Google. Find one that doesn't. Convince them. The bigger the sale, the more chance you have to taking this competition. The winner will be announced at our final meeting this afternoon. Good luck. Happy hunting!\" Everyone stood up and we went to our meeting spot, before the excitement could set in I motioned for everyone to sit down. \"I hate to be the downer today, but we can't do this without Billy.\" Stu looked up at me. \"You said you used to do sales?\" I nodded. \"I did, but I'm not as good as Billy.\" Turning I looked at Nick. \"You must have some idea where he went? You have to bring him back.\" Nick shook his head. \"He won't come back.\" I shook my head. \"Yes he will. You tell me where he is and I will make sure we bring him back. The rest of you, try to close a deal until we catch up.\" I turned back to Stu as the rest of the team nodded. \"I'll text you when we get Billy back, let me know where you guys are.\" \"Got it.\" Nodding I grabbed Nick and lead the way to my car. \"You were a manger at your old job weren't you?\" I laughed and nodded. \"Is it that obvious?\" He nodded as he told me where to go once I pulled away from Google Headquarters. \"So, you and Stu?\" I laughed again. \"You sound like Neha, but yeah.\" Pulling up to a nursing home I watched as Nick walked over to Billy and another man that looked like a douchebag. It took a few minutes of arguing before Nick managed to get Billy in the car so I could drive to the address Stu told me. Spotting the team I pulled to a stop and climbed out with the guys. Hugging Stu as Billy gathered everyone around, pointing at Yo-yo, who was missing an eyebrow. \"What happened there?\" \"Uh, well, he didn't bite, so it did not go well.\" I shook my head and pulled out my makeup kit to give Yo-yo his eyebrow back, listening to Billy as he spoke. \"You know who else it didn't go well for?\" Stu nodded. \"Lay it on us. Big daddy.\" \"That's right, the steel town girl, Alex. When she finally got her shot, she took a tumble and fell. You want to hear something totally nuts? She picked herself back up. She tightened that little ass, she pumped her legs, and she danced herself back into a slot at that dance school.\" \"And that's what we're going to do. Tighten your asses, let's go.\" I smirked and followed the guys into the pizza shop, watching them work their magic on the owner Sal. One look around and I could tell the team was learning from our two older members as we helped with the sell, knowing we had this in the bag. \"Faster Chris!\" \"Shut up Lyle!\" I was speeding as fast as my car would go, sliding into a parking spot we took off running to the closing ceremony, using a virus to play music as we passed out pizza. Dancing off to the side we watched as Graham was pissed demanding for the ceremony to continue. \"That's lovely theatrics, but the jig is up. It's too late. Rules are rules, right, Chetty?\" \"Yes. Rules are rules. And the rules state that every team has the right until the announcement is made to turn in their sales. So, in spite of your lack of punctuality, which is astounding. I have no choice but to accept this submission. And to recalculate.\" \"Go ahead. Recalculate. One sale to a small family pizza joint won't make a difference anyway.\" We looked at Chetty. \"It does seem that Mr. Hawtrey is correct once again.\" And just like that our excitement was extinguished. \"The sales from one shop on the last challenge are not enough to put you in the lead. But! This…is not one shop. You see, this is a blooming franchise with endless possibilities, thanks to you. And what you have done as a team is connect to people. And connect those people to information. Which is what we do. And more than that, you have the courage to dream. In spite of your obvious and astonishing limitations…you never gave up on that dream. So…gentlemen and ladies.\" Graham stood up. \"Whoa, whoa, hold on. Chetty, no offense, you're a glorified babysitter. Let's get somebody down here who means something.\" \"I'm right here.\" We turned and spotted a heavy set man with headphones around his neck. \"Graham, please meet Mr. Anderson.\" Billy turned to look at Chetty. \"You know this guy?\" \"I should think so. Andrew here is the head of Search…a rather important position here at Google.\" Graham was practically tripping over his head to be polite as Billy spoke up again. \"Look at you, Headphones. A little mystery behind the boy.\" Graham was completely confussed. \"How do you know him?\" Nick smirked. \"We were encouraged to reach out to experienced Googlers. Pretty simple, not really a mystery.\" Headphones started talking. \"To reach out to other Googlers, not just kiss their asses. You see, these interns are smart…collaborative…pretty…and just weird enough to make them interesting. Also, they came together as a team to do something here. Their Googliness is truly off the charts.\" We grinned as Graham lost it. \"Oh my God, stop with the \"Googliness\". What does that even mean?\" \"The fact that you don't know what it means is why you will never work here.\" I covered my laugh as Chetty turned to us. \"So, welcome to Google.\" Everyone cheered and we screamed and hugged each other. Turning I hugged Neha. \"Oh my God!\" We giggled as I turned and hugged Stu, locking our lips together for a moment before pulling apart. \"That was awesome.\" It was time for my friends to go back home for their last year of college. \"Have a great senior year guys. We'll keep your desk chairs warm. Team Lyle!\" We laughed and cheered and did a group hug. \"Yo-yo! Come! Now!\" We turned and spotted a pissed off Asian woman next to a silver car. \"Mom, I need a minute.\" \"We need to\" \"Mom. I'm saying good-bye to my friends. I'm taking a minute. Okay?\" I grinned and hugged Yo-yo as we did another group hug. \"Okay, you riff-raff, get out of here! See you down the road.\" Billy, Nick, and Lyle walked off. Turning I hugged Stu. \"You better come see me.\" He laughed, holding me closer. \"I will, once a week, I promise.\" I smiled and kissed him, enjoying the feel of his lips on mine, knowing I was going to miss it while he was gone. Pulling back I smiled at Neha. \"You better stay in contact too.\" She laughed. \"Oh I will.\" With one last hug to everyone I watched as they loaded the bus and left Headquarters. That's it! Hopefully I will see all of you in the future! ","Summary":" Hello everyone! And welcome to the newly updated Troublemaker!

What's going on in that sexy head of yours?\" Natalie asks gently making Salim lightly smirk before directing his wife's attention towards the computer screen. Salim watches in anticipation for his wife's response to reading the email from Jamal, who Salim had not heard from since he had left India! \"Oh wow! He wants to see you! You booked your flight yet?\" \"No. I don't know if I should go Natalie \" \"Why not?\" \"Well I don't want to leave this place for a start besides I can't go back there...especially how I left things\" Natalie strokes his cheek affectionately, \"Baby I know that your anxious about facing up with your past but your Brother has contacted you...besides I'm coming with you Salim!\" Salim smiles touched by his wife's kind heart as he lightly presses his lips against hers feeling his heart race as it always did! Salim really had found great happiness since leaving India, he had made a new life for himself and found himself falling in love which he never imagined would happen! \"So you sort out the flights while I deal with everyone's rota while we're away!\" Natalie says cheerily as she gets off his lap and leaves the office as Salim smiles to himself wondering how he had gotten so lucky? Later that evening as they lay in bed Salim holding Natalie in his arms his thoughts turned to the night he had left the Hospital, the feeling he had of great guilt that made his stomach churn with how he had treated both Latika and his own brother! He lightly strokes his wife's hair as he listens to her breathing heavily as she is deep in slumber as his mind wandered through his past and worrying whether it was really safe to head back to India, especially with his wife who was the most precious person in his life! \"What is wrong Salim?\" Natalie asks out the blue sounding half asleep as Salim sighs lightly, \"Ah trust you to guess when something is bothering me even with your eyes closed!\" \"It's a wife thing. So go on then baby tell me what's on my handsome husbands mind?\" Natalie asks lifting herself up and placing the bedside lamp on, \"I am just thinking about going back home...I don't know if you should come...it might not be safe...and I can't ever come close to losing you!\" \"Hey baby look at me! You won't ever lose me I promise you! We'll be together in our rocking chairs! Now I'm coming with you whether you like it or not!\" Salim smiles slightly amused knowing how stubborn his wife could be as he lightly places his lips against hers, \"What was that for?\" \"Do I need a reason Angel?\" \"No. Feel free to kiss me anytime you like!\" Salim and Natalie laugh lightly before huddling together again Salim lightly kissing the top of her head, \"I love you\" \"I love you more\" \"Not possible\" they both say laughing lightly as this was something they always said to each other as they slowly drift into sleep lying in each other's arms where they both belonged[Chapter 2] Part Two The following morning Salim and Natalie made their way into work walking hand in hand towards their restaurant, \"Morning Boss!\" Tyler says smiling as he continues emptying boxes filled with drink, \"Good morning Tyler!\" They both say as they enter the empty office as they both sit behind their desks both already feeling drained out, \"Shit!\" Natalie suddenly burst out frowning making Salim look over at his wife concerned, \"What?\" \"I have an appointment with Dr. Andrews!\" Natalie says looking panicked as she anxiously fumbled with her coat, \"Angel breathe! Keep calm Angel you need a lift?\" Natalie takes a long and slow breath before smiling lightly over at Salim, \"No. I'll be fine uh be back as soon as I can\" \"No worries Angel. I love you!\" Natalie leans over and kisses his lips before heading out of the office as Salim watches as Natalie is gone from sight he sighs annoyed at himself for not remembering she always saw Dr Andrews on a Friday morning, Salim felt his stomach churn in guilt knowing that Natalie tended to forget things when she was in a highly stressful and anxious state. What if she was getting all Ill again? Salim frowns at the thought of how dark things had gotten for his wife! Oh god this was not what he had promised her when he gave his vows to her. He had promised to protect her and to give her all the happiness that she more than deserved however he has caused her stress after stress oh and more stress which does not help her anxiety. Natalie sat in the small empty waiting room feeling her stomach flutter as her mind whirled with what dr Andrews was going to ask her today, \"Mrs Malik?\" Dr Andrews smiles warmly over at her making her smile politely back as she follows him into the room, \"And how are we today dear?\" \"Okay...I am less anxious than I was...my husband he makes me feel stronger!\" Dr Andrews smiles at this before jotting down notes onto a notepad, \"So last time we begun to discuss your childhood?\" Natalie nods her head slowly, \"I remember. I told you I had a normal happy childhood...\" \"So nothing traumatic happened?\" Natalie felt her body go all awkward as she looked to the floor, \"No nothing\" \"Really? You sure about that dear?\" Natalie felt the emotion force it's way out as her body trembled slightly, \"Natalie?\" \"I don't want to do this anymore...\" Natalie got off the chair and rushes out the room and out of the building loud sobs heaving out of her as she continued moving quickly. Natalie once she had gathered herself together made her way into work, \"Hey baby\" she says forcing a cheery tone as she walks straight towards her desk, \"Angel?\" Salim walks over to her and bends down beside her lightly taking her hands into his, \"I owe you a massive apology my dear beautiful wife!\" \"Apology why?\" \"Because I've been selfish and rather thoughtless...how was your appointment?\" \"Uh not so good...I ran out to be honest with you...Salim I just want to be here with you\" Salim nods his head understanding as he lightly kisses her forehead, \"Of course my angel. In that case back to work for us!\" Salim says winking at her before heading back to his desk making Natalie smile affectionately. Natalie and Salim enter their home both yawning feeling their body ache from their long day! Natalie and Salim fall onto the sofa as Natalie rests her head onto his shoulder, \"Oh what a long day huh?\" \"Tell me about it. Anyway maybe we should start packing for tomorrow?\" Natalie says letting out another yawn making Salim groan slightly, \"Yes I suppose we do. How about I pack whilst you do to bed Angel?\" \"Aw your sweet Salim Malik! But I need to decide what clothes I'm taking with me\" \"Ok let's get started. Then it's bed time Angel!\" Natalie kisses his lips before they both head into the bedroom and begin to pack both feeling relieved to be able to spend some quality time together. Once the packing was done both got ready for bed as they lay in each other's arms both trying to unwind a little before they slept, \"So you ready to tell me what happened?\" Salim asks gently making Natalie huddle closer into him, \"He asked me if anything traumatic happened in my childhood...I said no...he knew I was lying and it all got to much baby...you think I'm a coward?\" \"Of course not! Angel your the bravest person I know!\" Natalie looks confused over at her husband, \"I think your confusing me with yourself!\" \"Natalie Malik please start believing in yourself my angel! Please see what I see!\" \"Oh and what do you see?\" Natalie asks playfully making Salim smile before pressing his lips against her own, \"I'm seeing a very beautiful and very sexy woman who has made my life worth living for!\" Natalie felt her heart pound inside her chest as she pulls him closer as she kisses him eagerly, \"You know how sexy you are when you speak like that?!\" Salim laughs lightly before kissing her again as she wraps her arms around his neck as the kiss deepens both lost in each other as in this moment nothing else mattered.[Chapter 3] Part Three Salim wakes as the alarm on his phone stirs into life, as he lightly kisses Natalie's shoulder making her smile slightly before opening her eyes, \"Now that's the wake up call I like!\" Natalie says as she turns to face her husband, \"So ready to go back home baby?\" Natalie asks gently as she lightly strokes his face, \"Born ready Angel. Natalie thank you for being my rock!\" \"Well your always mine babe. It's about time I do the same for you!\" Salim presses his lips against hers as she wraps her arms around his neck deepening the kiss, \"Good job I set my alarm an extra half hour early!\" \"Oh just kiss me Salim!\" Natalie says as Salim kisses her passionately. An hour later they were sat waiting in the airport Natalie noticing how tense Salim looked making her place her hand into his, \"Baby?\" \"Yes I'm fine I promise Angel\" Natalie rests her head onto his shoulder making him lightly kiss her forehead as they both sat together in a comfortable silence. As promised Salim was met at the airport by a private driver who worked for Jamal, Natalie could see how hurt that Jamal hadn't come to the airport to greet them. Natalie leans her body into Salim's as they sat side by side, Salim feeling his stomach tighten as he felt his jaw clench which he always did when he was nervous. \"Salim you know everything will be okay?\" \"I know. Thank you my angel. What if he hates me though?\" Natalie squeezes his hand knowing how much he hates himself for what he had done, \"Jamal could never hate you. Besides I read that email he sounds like he's ready for a relationship with you again\" Salim nods slowly trying to take it all in before kissing his wife pulling her closer into him as they both gazed out the window at the place he had once called home. They eventually stopped outside a long driveway that led to a big White House, \"Wow it's beautiful!\" Natalie gasps as they stand together hand in hand looking at the house infront of them, \"Baby you ready?\" \"Yes. I have you angel!\" \"You'll always have me. I love you\" \"I love you more\" \"Not possible\" they both smile before kissing gently on the lips before they cautiously headed towards the house, \"Salim?\" Latika says beaming over at them as she walks out and greets them, \"Hello Latika! It's been awhile!\" They hug warmly before awkwardly turn to face Natalie, \"Oh Latika this is my beautiful angel of a wife Natalie!\" \"Oh wow uh hello Natalie lovely to meet you!\" \"Same to you! So uh lovely home!\" Natalie comments making Latika beam proudly, \"Yes it is. Oh of course uh come on in I've made us some tea!\" She heads back inside followed hand in hand by Salim and Natalie, \"Is Jamal here?\" Natalie asks making Latika look apologetically over at Salim, \"I'm afraid he's working...he will be home later on though\" Salim nods his head understanding whilst he felt his wife give a gentle squeeze of his hand to let him know she was here for him. They sat in the massive garden whilst Latika was in the kitchen getting the teas Natalie lightly kisses his hand, \"Baby I'm sorry about Jamal. Are you sad?\" \"Honestly I am but I kind of expected this. I must deal with the consequences of my actions!\" Natalie exhales slowly sensing her feeling upset for him Salim lightly strokes her hair, \"Here is the tea!\" Latika cheerily places a tray down onto the table infront of them smiling warmly, \"So I hear you own a restaurant?\" Salim began telling Latika all about how he bought a restaurant with the money they had given him, as he felt himself feeling more relaxed making Natalie smile brimming with pride over at her strong husband.[Chapter 4] Part Four It was midnight when Salim went to the guest room he was sleeping in, as he quietly entered the room not wanting to wake a fast asleep Natalie. Salim delicately got himself into the bed but as soon as he was under the sheets Natalie stirs awake smiling half asleep over at her husband as she huddles into his arms, \"Sorry Angel didn't mean to wake you!\" \"It's ok I was only dosing you know I can't sleep without you next to me\" \"Jamal is not home yet\" Salim says making Natalie lift her head frowning worried over at her husband, \"Oh I'm sorry baby! You wanna talk about it?\" \"No not really. I just want to hold my wife and hopefully speak with him tomorrow\" Natalie kisses his lips before lying back onto his chest as she rubs his scar lightly, \"You can hold me all night baby. I love being held Salim!\" Salim presses his lips against hers making her lie back against the bed as he lay on top of her, Her body tingling and pulsing with every touch as they got lost in each other. The following morning Salim lay wide awake watching Natalie as she slept, his hand entwined with hers as he smiled to himself taking in her beauty, \"Stop looking at me!\" Natalie says laughing slightly as she blushes making Salim kiss her lips, \"Can't help it your just too beautiful!\" Natalie wraps her arms around his neck, \"Wow your quite the charmer you know that Salim Malik?!\" \"How else could I get you to fall for me?!\" \"Well that and your rugged good looks!\" They both laugh lightly before kissing again, \"You feeling ok today?\" Natalie asks stroking his chest, \"Yes. I think so anyway\" \"You think so?\" \"Yeah. Don't worry about me angel\" \"You know I can't help it...besides I know when your lying Salim Malik...I love how you protect me but I can handle this you know\" \"Sorry angel I just can't have you ill again. But your right I shouldn't lie to my wife\" Natalie kisses his cheek before stroking his cheek, \"I know me being ill put you through a lot but I am better now and stronger...that's because of you Salim I would have been completely broken without you by my side. Now I want to be strong for you...I want to be your rock!\" Salim kisses Natalie tenderly before they both get off the bed and make their way downstairs where they heard voices coming from the kitchen, \"Brother?!\"[Chapter 5] Part Five Jamal turns looking taken aback slightly as he smiles awkwardly over at Salim as he walks over to them, \"Salim! Your looking well!\" \"So are you my brother!\" They both hug warmly making Natalie smile feeling choked with emotion, \"And you must be my new sister?\" \"Yeah hey I'm Natalie. I am so pleased to finally meet you!\" They hug awkwardly before they all sat at the kitchen table which was filled with food, \"Wow someone has been busy!\" Natalie comments happily as she fills up her plate with food, \"Yes my husband her enjoys to cook!\" Latika says smiling warmly as they all sat quietly eating contently. After breakfast Natalie and Latika left the two brothers to catch up whilst Latika showed Natalie around, \"So how long you and Salim been together?\" \"A year married six weeks of knowing each other\" \"Aw I'm so happy for him. Salim deserves happiness\" \"Really? I mean I agree with you I just thought...\" \"That after what happened I wouldn't forgive him. Look I never forget how he was willing to die to protect us...he is a different person I see that. You've made him really happy and better Natalie\" \"I don't know about that...I've put him through a lot. Latika will Jamal and Salim be close again?\" Latika frowns for a moment making Natalie shake her head slowly, \"Jamal still hasn't forgiven him has he?\" \"He's getting there\" Natalie was troubled by her conversation with Latika all day as she felt torn in whether she should mention it to her husband or whether she should leave it, Natalie sat on the bed lost in her thoughts her stomach churning as she felt anxious knowing how much this would break Salim's heart, \"Hey Angel...Angel?\" Salim sits on the edge of the bed and lightly strokes her leg, \"Hey how was your day?\" \"Great. Something is wrong what is it?\" Natalie broke down into tears as Salim pulls her into him as he frowns concerned, \"What is all this angel?\" \"Sorry...earlier I was talking with Latika...and she said that Jamal...he's not forgiven you... I'm so sorry!\" Salim sighs stroking her cheek, \"I see\" Natalie frowns confused by his confused by her husbands calmness, \"Look at me angel don't you get upset over this as I assure you everything is fine!\" \"But I was the one insisting on coming out here...\" \"Don't go blaming yourself! I'm glad you convince me to come angel!\" \"Really?\" \"Yes. I have my brother back whether he's forgiven me or not!\" Natalie smiles sadly over at her husband as she kisses his lips gently, \"I love you Salim\" \"I love you more\" \"Not possible\"[Chapter 6] Part Six Later that evening they all sit out in the garden slowly eating some dinner everyone awkwardly silent, \"So Salim what are your plans tomorrow?\" Jamal asks casually, \"Actually I thought that I'd spend the day with my wife\" Salim says taking Natalie's hand into his own making Natalie look affectionately over at him, \"Ah I'm glad that you won't miss me too much while I'm at work. Actually there is something I wanted to speak with you about maybe come over to the hotel later?\" \"Of course. Uh why what's going on brother?\" Salim asks sensing tension between Jamal and Latika, \"Let's leave that for tomorrow \" both Salim and Natalie frown at each other as they look confused over at Jamal and Latika, \"Is it bad?\" Natalie asks concerned not wanting Salim to be hurt, \"It's not for you to worry about!\" Jamal snaps making Natalie look hurt, \"Brother don't speak to my wife like that!\" Salim says annoyed making Natalie lightly place her hand on his, \"Aw it's fine please don't argue\" Natalie begs feeling her stomach flutter and her arm begin to tingle, \"Jamal don't!\" Latika warns her husband who looked close to saying something, \"No Latika Jamal should say it!\" Salim says sharply, \"Ok if you really want to know I'm buying your restaurant off you!\" They both sat in shock for a moment before Shaking Salim stood and walked away making Natalie angrily shake her head, \"How could you?!\" Natalie says as she goes to find Salim. Salim is sat outside on the front porch smoking his cigarette when Natalie places herself beside him, \"Baby?\" \"I have taking all the anger and all that I deserve for my past actions but I will not give up our restaurant! That is our future. Our children's future!\" Natalie nods her head understanding as she puts her arm around her waist and rests her head onto his shoulder, \"I'm so sorry that he did this to you baby!\" \"I know. But I'm going to fight for this!\" \"Correction we are going to fight for this!\" \"Oh we are a team aren't we angel!\" \"Of course. You and me baby always and forever!\" Salim lightly brushes his lips against hers, \"I love you Natalie Malik!\" \"I love you more!\" \"Not Possible!\" They both kiss gently before heading back inside hand in hand making their way into the guest room, \"Salim please wait?\" Latika asks looking upset making Salim hesitate before he lightly touches her back, \"Angel I'll be in soon sweetheart!\" \"Ok I'll wait up for you. Night baby\" Natalie kisses his cheek before continuing into the guest room whilst Salim turns to face Latika, \"Look Jamal thought it was for the best. I had no idea that's why he wanted to see you I promise you Salim\" Salim nods his head slowly taking it all in, \"I believe you but your still backing him up even though you know this is wrong!\" \"He's my husband. Like Natalie has your back\" \"Yes but this is different. This is my families future Latika!\" Latika nods her head looking deep in thought, \"Maybe you and Jamal could come to some arrangement\" \"Arrangement! That's my restaurant Latika!\" \"I know but that was Jamal's money Salim!\" Salim looks stung before walking away heading into the guest room, \"Baby? What happened?\" Natalie asks sitting alert on the bed making Salim stroke her leg reassuringly, \"Angel let's spend the whole day together tomorrow!\" Natalie nods her head smiling sadly as she strokes his hair, \"Sounds perfect baby\" Natalie kisses him tenderly as Salim deepens the kiss as they lie back onto the bed, \"I love you so much\" \"Your sexy when you talk like that! Well your sexy already because your the best husband\" Natalie kisses Salim again more passionately as Salim begins to unbutton her top whilst kissing her neck making Natalie close her eyes as she makes a noise of pleasure, as Salim touch on her skin makes her tingle in pleasure as she lightly kisses his bare chest making him make a noise of pleasure before kissing her tenderly.[Chapter 7] Part Seven The following morning Salim and Natalie left the house early as they not wanted to see or hear from either Jamal or Latika, \"So where you fancy going my angel?\" Salim asks as he drives one of Jamal's vehicles, \"How about you surprise me baby. Show me your India\" Salim laughs lightly smiling as he takes her hand and lightly kisses it making Natalie smile affectionately, \"I love you my Angel. You've really have saved me you know that!\" \"Ditto Salim. We save each other and I love you baby!\" Natalie says kissing his cheek lightly, \"Surprise it is. Let's get away from it all my angel\" Natalie nods sympathetic as she stroked his hair, \"Yeah quality time you and me baby. So you ready to speak to me yet?\" \"Nothing to say Angel. If he wants our restaurant then he has a fight on his hands!\" Salim and Natalie sat the rest of the journey in a comfortable silence as Natalie took in her surroundings, \"Do you miss living here?\" \"No not really. Not my home anymore\" Natalie nods her head slowly as her mind thought of how close to death Salim had gotten, making her eyes water as she looks out the window swallowing the lump in her throat, \"Hey? Angel? You alright?\" Salim asks gently taking her hand into his making Natalie nod her head trying to fight back the emotion she was feeling, \"I'm fine. Really I am\" \"Angel it's me. What's wrong?\" \"Just thinking sad things... I'm being daft!\" Salim parks the car and pulls Natalie closer towards him knowing where her mind was taking her, \"Natalie Malik I'm here and I'm not going anywhere my beautiful wife!\" Natalie huddles closer into him closing her eyes as he strokes her hair, \"I know. Told you I was being silly... I just can't bare the thought of losing you Salim!\" Salim kisses her forehead before wiping tears from her cheeks, \"I'm not going anywhere angel!\" Salim says firmly, \"I love you\" \"I love you more\" \"Not Possible!\" Natalie and Salim arrive at Jamal's hotel later that evening taking him by surprise, \"Salim?\" \"Brother thought I'd check out the place!\" \"Oh right uh follow me into the office\" Jamal beckons making Natalie squeeze Salim's hand reassuringly, \"I'll wait here. You go sort things out baby!\" Natalie kisses his lips before Salim strokes her cheek as he follows his brother into the office while Natalie sat herself into a chair taking in everything, \"Natalie?\" \"Oh hello Latika\" \"Hello. Is Salim with you?\" \"Yes they are talking to each other\" \"Good. I'm glad to hear it \" \"Yes. So how long you knew?\" \"I'm sorry I really am! But Jamal does have a right!\" Natalie shakes her head standing to face Latika, \"How dare you! Salim bought that restaurant and it has been a lifeline for him! He needs that place to survive!\" Latika was about to respond when Salim came storming out, \"Angel we're going!\" Natalie took his hand as they head towards the car both getting inside as Natalie frowns with concern, \"What happened baby?\" Salim sighs heavily looking hurt over at Natalie, \"He insinuated something hurtful! He hardly knows you and I am beyond offended!\" Natalie places her hand onto his and squeezes gently, \"Baby whatever he had said to you it's not worth getting angry over!\" \"It is angel. You are harmless in all of this and I won't stand for anyone speaking badly of you!\" She kisses his cheek as they head back towards the house both starting to pack, \"I'll sort out getting a flight you continue packing\" \"Ok baby. Salim wait come here\" Natalie wraps her arms around his waist and lightly kisses him, \"What was that for?\" \"Because I love you silly! And I really am sorry for how your brother has treated you\" \"Oh angel thank you for being my rock! I'm truly blessed to have you in my life!\" They kiss passionately before Salim pulls out his phone and dials the number for the airline whilst Natalie continued to pack their bags actually feeling a great swell of guilt for convincing Salim to come.[Chapter 8] Part Eight Natalie and Salim sat together in the stuffy terminal waiting for their flight, Salim sensing his wife's anxiety making him regret bringing her into this mess. Salim takes hold gently of her hand that she was chewing her nail, \"Angel relax please\" Natalie looked troubled with worry as she pulls Salim closer towards her, \"How can I possibly relax when it's my fault for this whole entire mess!\" Salim sighs shaking his head in disbelief, \"Natalie Malik what are you going on about?!\" \"Well if I hadn't convinced you to come over here then none of this would of happened!\" Natalie explains tears lightly falling down her face making Salim pull out a tissue from his pocket and gently wipe her face looking lovingly into her eyes, \"Angel none of this is your fault! I wanted to come besides Jamal is the one who wants to do this\" Natalie presses her head into his chest making him stroke her hair, \"Sorry. I should be strong for you and your consoling me...I just can't bare the thought of all your hard work being taking from you!\" \"Hey hey shh angel! Since when do I let things get taken from me! I won't give up on this on our future!\" Natalie pulls Salim closer as she kisses him passionately, \"Wow not that I'm complaining but what was that for?\" \"Because I love you and I love how passionate you are! Salim Malik I'm so lucky to be your wife!\" Salim smiles touched as he lightly kisses her before placing a hand on the smell of her back, \"Come on angel lets go home!\" Eventually after what felt like a never ending journey they were back home, Natalie was carried in by Salim who gently lays his drained out wife onto the bed lightly covering the duvet over her before placing a kiss onto her forehead, \"Sweet dreams my angel\" Salim quietly tiptoes out the room and makes his way into the kitchen area where he noticed that on the house phone there was a message, \"Hello it's me pick up loser!\" Salim smiles shaking his head as he deletes the message from Danni their best friend, Natalie must not have told them that they were away... Salim chews his lip which he did when he was lost in his own mind and thoughts. What if she was pretending to be fine? Salim knew his wife and how she would not want to worry anyone and cause them upset... \"You okay?\" Natalie asks groggily barely keeping her eyes open, \"Oh I didn't wake you did I angel?!\" \"No uh I couldn't relax...so you never answered my question\" \"Oh right yes I'm fine. Come here angel\" Natalie sits herself onto his lap as he pulls her gently closer as she wraps her arms around his shoulders, \"Angel I just want you to know that I am always here for you and there is nothing you could do or say that could change that!\" Natalie smiles bilwildered by where this had come from, \"Babe why tell me that?\" \"Just needed you to know. So want to talk about why you can't sleep?\" Natalie looks away looking close to tears making Salim lightly pull the hair away from her face, \"I'm sorry Salim\" \"Why?\" \"For being a terrible wife. You deserve so much better than me!\" \"Angel don't say that! Now what is going on?\" Natalie bursts into tears making Salim frown with concern, \"I am just feeling sick...my mind just keeps working overtime with thoughts...I can't sleep...\" \"Just like last time. Oh angel I knew I should of put my foot down in not going to India! Have you phoned the counsellor?\" Natalie shakes her head firmly, \"Babe I can't speak to him! Look it's not like last time because I'm in control of it plus I'm taking my meds!\" \"That's why you need to tell me angel. You and me are a team!\" Natalie nods her head a sad smile on her face before she lightly brushes her lips against his making both their hearts race and their mind hazy.[Chapter 9] Part Nine Later that evening Salim watches as his wife sleeps in his arms frowning as he lightly strokes her arm. Salim knew that he was the one that had made her worry, he also knew that all this arguing between him and his brother had not helped the situation for Natalie. \"Oh angel I'm so sorry to bring you into this!\" He says quietly as she huddles closer into Salim getting deeper into her slumber, Salim sighs longingly knowing that he could not let her get that Ill again! \"Salim what's on your mind?\" Natalie asks groggily still eyes closed making Salim frown lightly amused, \"How'd you know that?\" \"Salim I don't need to have my eyes open to sense when something is bothering you!\" \"Wow amazing!\" \"Baby? Please just tell me?\" Natalie asks desperately as she looks into his eyes, \"To be honest angel I am worried about you...I can't have you ill again!\" Natalie wraps her arms around him, \"Hey you listen to me Salim Malik I have no intention of getting ill again! Look at me I am much better now and that's because I have you Salim. You make me be brave.\" Salim kisses her forehead before making quick kisses eagerly down at her body making Natalie close her eyes in longing as she felt her heart pound as each touch made her make a noise of passion. The next morning Natalie woke to find an empty space on Salim's side making her frown slightly she made her way into the kitchen, \"Wow morning handsome!\" Natalie says wrapping her arms around Salim's making him smirk slightly as he turns his head and kisses her lips before continuing making pancakes, \"Good morning my angel!\" \"So what's with the cooking baby?\" \"Well I wanted to give my angel a nice treat to show her how much I love her!\" Natalie kisses his cheek before heading towards the fridge when both stop short as the front door banged into life, \"Hang on!\" Natalie calls out as she makes her way towards the front door to find standing on her front step a worn out looking Latika, \"Hello Natalie...\" \"Uh what uh come on in\" Natalie says unable to think clearly as she lets Latika in as Salim stops cooking and share the same look of puzzled with his wife, \"So is he here aswell?\" Salim asks tensely over at Latika who shakes her head, \"Oh so your just doing his dirty work then?!\" Natalie snaps making Salim wrap an arm around her shoulders, \"Not quite no. He thought it would be best if I spoke to you guys first...\" \"There is nothing I can do to get him to change his mind?\" \"No sorry Salim\" Natalie looks sadly over at a stern Salim, \"Then tell my brother that he has a fight on his hands because I'm not giving my restaurant up without a fight!\" \"But Salim...\" \"You heard my husband. Now I think you better get going don't you!\" Natalie says protectively as Latika turns and leaves the house, which as soon as she does Salim pulls Natalie into him and kisses her lightly, \"How you feeling?\" \"Honestly I don't know. I thought that maybe he would change his mind...does he really hate me this much?!\" \"Oh baby come here!\" Natalie holds her husband as she lightly strokes his cheeks, \"We will get through this together. I promise Salim!\" Salim smiles sadly as he presses his lips against hers, \"I sure hope so my angel I sure hope so!\"[Chapter 10] Part Ten Salim and Natalie walk hand in hand into the restaurant to find Latika sat waiting for them in the small office, \"Babe want me to get rid of her?\" Natalie asks protectively making Salim shake his head sighing, \"No thank you angel. I need to sort this one and for all!\" Salim kisses her forehead before heading into the office as Natalie watches frowning with concern. Natalie had a busy morning as all the staff was rushed off their feet, \"So that's the sister in law then?\" \"Yes Tyler...don't go getting any ideas you!\" \"I never said anything Nat!\" \"You don't need too!\" The office door opens and Latika heads out and shyly passes them, \"Won't be long Ty hold the fort!\" Natalie heads into the office closing the door behind her, \"Babe?\" Natalie asks looking concerned over at a stern looking Salim who looks deep in his thoughts, \"Oh uh hey angel...\" \"What did she say?\" Natalie asks placing herself into his lap as Salim wraps his arms around her waist, \"Jamal wants to be joint owners...he would own more\" Natalie frowns, \"Babe you worked so hard to get this place up and running...you love this place...are you really considering it babe?\" Salim frowns deeply before exhaling slowly, \"Natalie your right I do love this place but I love you more...look quality time with each other is something that is lacking giving our current shifts here but if Jamal took over...\" \"Are you sure you want to do this Salim?\" \"Yes. I love you Natalie!\" \"And I love you Salim Malik always will!\" They both kiss before joining the staff in the restaurant trying to help ease the load of work. Later on that evening Natalie and Salim lay in bed both feeling drained out of energy, \"Long old day huh!\" \"Certainly has my angel!\" Salim lightly kisses her lips making Natalie's heart race as she deepens the kiss wrapping her arms around his neck pulling him closer, his hands lightly caressing her body making her lightly moan in pleasure. Salim gently lifts off her top as he lightly kisses her neck as she closes her eyes biting her lip as her hands fumbled towards his boxers as she begins to clumsily pull them off. They both lay huddled out of breath in each other's arms as Salim strokes her hair, \"Baby you know I'm proud of you today?\" \"Really angel?\" \"Yeah. I know how hard that must of been but you put your family first...I love you so much Salim!\" \"I love you more my angel!\" \"Not possible!\" \"So when is Jamal coming?\" \"His flight is in the morning...Natalie you are not mad with my decision are you?\" \"No baby. I support you no matter what. Just want my man to be happy!\" \"Well I'm more than happy I have you my angel!\" They both kiss tenderly before huddling closer they both eventually sleep peacefully in each other's arms. ","Summary":" Salim & Natalie- Soulmates Part One - Salim Salim Malik was sat alone left to his thoughts as he sa"},{"Movie":"Benny and Joon","Title":"Surprised?","Author":"Ed-Wood","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1584884","Passage":"[Chapter 1] * I wrote this story back in 2003/4, (its now 2010) and I've only just revisisted it after all these years (I think my writing style has changed a little since then! lol) I've only just realised that: 1. the formatting looked atrocious (due to various changes to the fanfic website) - so I've hopefully fixed that up now. 2. there's now an actual Benny and Joon section! So that is where this story will live from now on! So, hopefully format-wise it'll be a bit more easier on the eye! Everything else is left as it was. So thanks for your time fellow fanfictioners! Happy reading! :-) [Benny And Joon] This is supposed to be set a couple of months later (after the film) NB - Uh, this is my first ever attempt to write a fan fiction, please be kind! If I suck heaps.\"Well, my next one will be better!\" Oh yeah, I don't own Benny And Joon yadda yadda yadda, but I sure wish I owned Sam! - but don't we all?! Thanks! Surprised? All was just peachy with the two happy couples. Joon was better than she has been in a long time, spending her days at the park, painting (professionally), or at Ruthy's diner. Sam of course, is still working at the local video store, even maintaining a record of six consecutive wins of employee of the month, thanks to his encyclopedic knowledge of film. Together they live in contented bliss in the apartment just up the hall from Ruthy's; ironing cheese sandwiches together, Joon concocting her, delicious smoothies, and Sam - cleaning everything in the house until you could see your face in if it wasn't shiny to begin with. Meanwhile, Benny and Ruthy were beginning to get really serious, although Ruthy still lived in the apartment down the hall, and Benny decided to hang onto the house. The two couples were perfectly happy and content, or so it was thought. \"Hey Ruthy!\" called out Sam as he went out front to help her with her groceries. Sam was looking wonderful as usual. Unkempt chestnut locks framed his handsome face, his dark soulful eyes were almost childlike in their sweetness. In his attire, he looked as though he had just leaped out of an old Buster Keaton silent film, except on his way out, he had managed to swipe Charlie Chaplin's cane. \"Hi Sam! How are you and Joon? \" she asked, as he relieved her of the many grocery bags. \"Oh, I'm fine\" he replied with a pleasant smile, as his knees buckled comically from the weight of the bags. \"Oh, ah Joon's kinda busy at the moment, some people are interested in her paintings. Great huh? Oh, um - \" he lowered his voice, as if afraid someone was listening in on their conversation -\"it's you-know-what next week. Are you still up to it?\". \"Oh my goodness, I almost forgot!\" They quickly got the bags inside. \"So whose apartment are we using?\" Ruthy asked, as Sam helped her put the groceries away. He removed his hat and scratched his head as if in deep thought \"I, um, yours?\" Ruthy checked her calendar \"Sounds good to me. We just have to make sure Joon doesn't find out!\" Sam nodded in solemn agreement. Ruthy looked at him with a twinkle in her eye \"Yes, this will be just our little secret.\"[Chapter 2] Hi again,. Isn't Johnny Depp just THE BEST *sighs dreamily. Of course I don't own Benny or Joon, although I wish I owned Sam!!!! :( *Oh, a special thanks to Lip Balm and Dramachick1 who took the time to review my story. Thanks heaps! NB - In my first chapter, sometimes I had those 3 full stops - you know. . . but it looks like only one in random places (thanks to freaky fanfiction formatting), just letting you know my grammar isn't quite THAT awful! Sam woke up to the familiar humming of the blender. Yawning softly, Sam gazed over at the Frank Capra calendar hanging from the brightly painted wall opposite him. Only six days to go. . .he smiled as he pulled on his suspenders. He grabbed his hat and cane and wandered into the kitchen. \"Hey Sam, today's breakfast consists of preserves of the apricot variety, corn flakes, and milk. Drink up! I can't let you leave without a good solid breakfast!\" Joon smiled sweetly as she greeted Sam. Her hair shone brilliantly in the morning sun. Sam gulped down Joon's newest concoction. \"Mmmmm\" Sam smiled approvingly. \"I thought I might go to the park today to paint, would you like to meet up during your lunch break and maybe have a picnic?\" Joon inquired. Sam scraped through his brain for a good excuse \"Gosh, I'm sorry Joon, I have to work through my lunch break today - \" Sam held his hat in his hands and gazed sorrowfully at the floor. I hate lying to Joon like this. Joon could clearly see Sam looked upset. Boy, he must like picnics more than I thought... Joon tenderly stroked Sam's cheek. \"It's okay Sam, maybe another time.\" * * * Sam carefully - almost lovingly, examined the cover of the video \"Oh, Swing Time is a wonderful choice miss! Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are the way to go!\" Before leaving, the woman turned back to Sam. \"Oh Sam, would you know, uh -\" the woman's face scrunched up in deep concentration \"what movie has that famous line. . .ah, I am big - \" \"it's the picture's that got small?\" Sam responded in his best Gloria Swanson voice. \"Oh, Sunset Boulevard, 1950.\" \"Oh, thank you so much Sam! See ya!\" Sam waved back shyly. The woman beamed with content as she left the shop. It was exactly 12 o'clock when the door opened with a chime, and in walked Ruthy, looking very pretty in her waitress uniform. \"Listen Sam, I've only got a short break, business is really buzzing today! So we'll have to make it quick. I hope you don't mind\". Sam smiled reassuringly. \"Oh it won't take long, just you know, in and out before the end of lunch\". Meanwhile back home, Joon realized she was running dangerously low on paint. Usually, she was supposed to call either Benny or Sam to get any supplies she needed, but Benny was out of town for the week, and Joon didn't wish to interrupt Sam at work today - as he seemed kind of upset, and plus, he said he'd be really busy. Joon pulled on a clean sun dress and calmly began to make her way outside. ' Poor Sam! I wonder why he seemed this morning? It couldn't really be about lunch, it must be something else' Joon pondered thoughtfully as she strolled downtown. These thoughts also helped to prevent Joon from doing . Like the time she tried to direct traffic with ping pong paddles, while wearing a snorkel mask she had got in a poker game. Just as Joon was about to set foot in the craft shop, she thought she caught a glimpse of Sam and Ruthy walking together on the opposite side of the street. No, couldn't be, Sam said he had to work through his break... She looked again, and they were gone. ' Oh well, there goes my mind' Joon thought pleasantly as she entered the shop. \"Gosh, that was close!\" Sam mouthed to Ruthy. Sam's heart was pounding. He couldn't stand the thought of Joon thinking he had lied to , he had.. sort of, but it is for her own good. * * * Later that night, Sam and Joon watched Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\". They were up to the famous 'shower scene'. Joon glanced affectionately towards Sam, as he, with eyes wide open, made frantic stabbing motions in the air, shrieking in a high pitched voice, \"Ahhhh ahhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!\" While Marion Crane's blood was oozing down the drain, Joon casually mentioned her trip downtown. \"Hey Sam, I had to go into town today to get some paint. Can you believe it, I thought I saw you and Ruthy! Imagine that! But it couldn't have been, because you were stuck in the video shop all day, and that's on the other side of town!\" Sam spun cautiously around to face her \"Really? Wow, maybe I have a twin! I wonder which one of us is the evil one?\" he started to laugh softly, now pulling a crazy face and pretending he had a chain saw. Joon smiled back, although she could feel something pestering her deep down, she decided to let it go. Don't worry, stop overreacting, it's nothing, really...[Chapter 3] OH MY GOSH!!!! You would NOT believe it! As I was writing this Benny And Joon fan fiction - The Proclaimers \"I'll be (500 miles)\" just came on the radio!! It's like a sign or something! OK, this chapter is a bit boring, but PLEASE stick with it, (hopefully) it will get better . . . honest! - Also, a special thank you to all those people who have take the time to read my dodgy story - AND review it. PLEASE - Keep it up! THANKS again. Now, on with the story . . . \"Ruthy, you know, we've got to be more careful. I thinks she's starting to suspect something! I mean yesterday and all, that was really close!\" Sam nervously bit his lip, and started to fiddle with his hat. Ruthy placed her cup of tea on the glass coffee table and looked at Sam, gazing deeply into his eyes. \"Sam sweetie, it'll be all right. I bet she didn't even taken any real notice of us. Even if you were supposed to be at work, she'd probably assume you were just relieved on short notice.\" Ruthy paused to place a comforting hand on Sam's lap. \"So calm down, relax. She won't know . . . until it's too late!\" Ruthy said with a mischievously coy grin. Sam immediately brightened. He placed his hat firmly on his head, gave a small nod, and bent over to pick up his cane. \"Thank you Ruthy, I think I feel a little better now. Uh, would you mind if we met up again a little later?\" Sam inquired hopefully. \"Of course I wouldn't mind!\" Ruthy replied playfully with a small wink. Joon poked her head out the door, just as she heard Sam leaving Ruthy's apartment. 'Hmmm, he's been spending a lot of time with Ruthy lately' Joon thought quietly to herself. 'Well, she's our friend, and Benny's partner in itemhood. So why does it feel so strange... ' Joon's current train of thought was broken as Sam came in to view. Joon leaped backward into their apartment and immediately went back to concocting her breakfast smoothy. \"Oh, uh, hi Joon! I didn't know you were up!\" Sam tossed his hat onto a rung on the hat stand, and eased onto the kitchen stool. He picked up the two shiny silver spoons sitting next to him, and started to perform a clanging rendition of \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" on the breakfast glasses. For some unknown reason, this morning, Joon just couldn't bear to tolerate Sam's . . . 'music' - no matter how sweet or whimsical it was. She immediately seized the offending spoons from Sam's grasp. Sam's face fell. 'It's never bothered her before, hmmm. Was I out of tune?' Sam quietly excused himself and trudged towards the bedroom, shoulders slightly slumped, feeling a little hurt. Joon instantly felt guilty. 'What is the matter with me? she thought helplessly. Meanwhile upstairs, Sam sat on the edge of the dresser, staring at his small photograph of Buster Keaton. 'What should I do Buster? You would know what to do. I don't know how much longer I can stand this. I hate lying to Joon - but I've just got to see Ruthy! ' Dozens of thoughts and emotions were swimming wildly around Sam's head, causing him to topple off the edge - literally. \"Ouch!\" Rubbing his knee tenderly, Sam limped amusingly towards the door and shut it gently, not wishing to annoy Joon any further. * * * Sam was determined to see Ruthy. Later that night, while Joon was painting in the other room, Sam crept quietly to the refrigerator. Once there, he inspected its contents. Staring back at him were three gigantic tubs of tapioca. Sam gulped uneasily at the sight. With shaking hands, he picked up the tubs and placed them on the table. Sam sat down and stared at the massive tubs with determination. 'This is kinda drastic, but at least I'll have a reason to see Ruthy. Hmmm, just think - it's kinda like in 'Cool Hand Luke', when Paul Newman's gotta eat all those eggs . . . Except it's tapioca' Sam thought, in an attempt to reassure himself. Sam put on a brave face, as he courageously picked up the spoon and began to gulp down the mammoth tubs of tapioca. * * * After the final mouthful, Sam thought he would explode - \"Monty Python's: The Meaning of Life\" style! \"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh\" Sam groaned softly. Sam slid from the kitchen chair and stumbled out into the living room to watch a Chaplin short - hoping it would take his mind off his . . . er, slight stomach ache. After allowing about 20 mins for the tapioca to go down, Sam knocked on the door of Joon's art room - as she liked her privacy when painting, and told her \"Joon, we're out of tapioca\". Joon spun around to face Sam and frowned with confusion. \"No we're not. There's three huge tubs in the fridge!\" Sam looked away sheepishly. Exasperated, Joon got up and stalked towards the kitchen. \"I could have sworn there was! What happened to them?\" Sam, once again stared to fiddle with his hat. \"Oh, er . . . I don't know.\" Joon could not believe it, she was positive there were three tubs - gigantic ones! ' There goes my mind again, I guess' . All this talk of tapioca was making Joon a little peckish. \"Say, how about I go get some more?\" Sam suggested as he grabbed his cane and dashed outside before Joon could say anything. Once outside the building, Sam rushed over to the bushes and . . . (you- know-what). Feeling slightly better, but looking like a smashed rummy, Sam made his way down to Ruthy's diner. Just as Ruthy was locking up, Sam stumbled into view. \"What on earth happened to you?!\" came Ruthy's alarmed voice, racing over to Sam's aid. \"Tapioca\" Sam replied weakly. \"Well come on Sam, we better go back to my place\" . . .[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: My friend said your supposed to have one of these for EVERY chapter . . . oops! OK so, I don't own Benny and Joon - But I soooo wish I owned Sam! On another subject - well, so far I've got *counts fingers - 6 reviews. Come on guys! How 'bout enough to count on fingers AND toes?! Savvy? *Provocatively waves Sam's hat around in face of potential reviewers - wink- wink-knudge-knudge! OK, I know there isn't much point to this chapter (plot wise), but I well . . . felt like it. This is SUPPOSSED to be just a cutsie, feel-good type thing, getting ready for the . . . PG chapter!!! *Evil laugh . . . chokes. Anyway, on with the (so called) story! Joon rolled over to see Sam lying next to her - upside down. In the morning sun, Sam looked so sweet and peaceful, it seemed a shame to wake him up. 'I don't remember hearing him come in' Joon thought to herself. 'Now stop that! This is SAM you're talking about' she silently reasoned. Sam stirred quietly, murmuring something about \"no more wire hangers!\" Joon carefully slid out of bed, and pulled out her secret collection of charcoal drawings she had been making of Sam since they had first met. Joon lovingly sketched the contours of Sam's handsome face, perfectly recreating his distinctive features - those beautiful, dark eyes; his shoulder-length tresses - all with painstaking accuracy. Sam groaned softly, rolling over to face Joon, who had by now, replaced the drawings safely back in their secret spot. Sam gave a tiny smile as he wiped the sleep out of his eyes. \"Good morning Sam\" Joon greeted \"I didn't hear you come in last night\". Sam still wasn't feeling too good. \"Hmmm?\" came the sleepy reply. \"No matter\" Joon responded as she hopped up and went out to the kitchen. Sam flopped onto his back and stared at the ceiling. 'Hmmm, what did I get up to last night? I feel all sore . . . Ummm . . . tapioca . . . Ruthy . . . Ruthy's place . . .' Sam paused. \" Oh dear! I couldn't have done that, I wouldn't go THAT far . . . or would I? ' Sam could not believe it. It just wasn't possible . . . but he HAD done it. OH GOD! What would Joon think if she knew?! Sam was sure glad it was his day off today, he would be able to take Joon to the park, and hopefully, take Joon's mind off anything . . . slightly suspicious. * * * Sam tied his neckerchief in a loose bow and grabbed his coat. As Sam slowly wandered out into the kitchen, he could hear Joon talking softly to herself. Sam knew it was best not to answer or interrupt, so after silently grabbing a sandwich from the counter, spun around and made his way to the bathroom. While Sam was sitting in the bath, happily eating his peanut butter and banana sandwich, Joon knocked on the door. \"So, did you want to have a picnic while we're at the park today, or did you want to go to Ruthy's diner?\" Sam knew it might be a little risky . . . as well as suspicious to see Ruthy again, so soon . . . well, only suspicious if Joon actually suspected anything . . . \"Ah, a picnic would be nice\" Sam quickly answered. Better to be safe . . . * * * As Sam and Joon strolled around the park, Sam noticed a pretty bunch of daisies growing just ahead. Sam made a how-'bout-I-pick-you-some-nice-daisies? gesture. Joon nodded shyly in acceptance. Sam placed his hat on Joon's head, and made his way towards the bush. Staring at the flowers intently, Sam lent his cane against a tree, rolled up his sleeves and bent over to pick one - but the damn flower wouldn't budge! Sam scratched his head with confusion, frowning at the evil daisy. Determined, he once again attempted to pick the flower - this time he grabbed it with both hands, dug his feet into the grass and tugged comically. Joon watched in amusement as Sam repeatedly attempted to extract the flower. * * * 10 mins later, Sam decided to make a final attempt before getting Joon to burn the stupid bush. Dramatically wiping the sweat of his forehead, he pulled with all his might. The flower seemed to extend for almost a metre! Sam was smiling broadly with satisfaction - until he realized the daisies were actually somehow attached to the park's watering system. 'Oh dear' was Sam's last thought before the system's water came back on - drenching poor Sam from head to toe. Sam turned sheepishly towards Joon, shrugged ' well - what- can- you-do ?' Exhausted, Sam handed Joon the single daisy he had managed to remove - causing Joon to start giggling uncontrollably. As Sam trotted back over to the tree to collect his cane, he slipped on the water soaked grass and somersaulted over a bush. Sam shook his head like a wet dog and attempted to stand up - but not before poking his head over the bush. Only just noticing the small group of park go-ers who had wandered over. Seizing the opportune moment, Sam leaped up and started to perform a few of his favourite Buster Keaton routines - just as he did after he first met Benny and Joon. Ah, those were good times. * * * On their way back home, Joon looked over at Sam adoringly, wondering how on earth she could ever be suspicious of someone so sweet? Someone like Sam? Joon knew Sam would NEVER do anything even remotely wrong, or to hurt her in any way. Joon held her hand near Sam's, their fingers slowly becoming entwined. They both turned and gazed into each other's eyes . . . and smiled. Um, I don't know if that WAS a cute widdle feel-good chapter or not. Well, I tried. It's kinda hard to capture Sam's slapstick abilities, so review please - and be kind. Thanks all! Oh, and a special thanks to Lady Aragorn for her kind words and inspiration for this chapter![Chapter 5] Disclaimer - I don't own Benny & Joon yadda-yadda-yadda - *sigh, wish I owned Sam - or at the very least - his hat! (Seriously - how cool is it?!) OK - this is it - the chapter you will ALL hate me for! lol But remember - it's all in the name of plot . . . honest! NB: This is the hardest chapter I had to write - you'll see why . . .eep! Joon was in a much better mood after the previous day's shenanigans at the park. At breakfast, she even returned Sam's spoons to play his music. Sam beamed happily as he started to play the theme song from \"Singin' In The Rain\" on the nearby breakfast glasses. Sam had noticed Joon's change in mood and decided that it might be a little easier to see Ruthy now Joon's mind was taken away from any suspicious thoughts. \"Joon, I've got to work an extra shift tonight. Edward said he had to visit his mother. . . uh, who lives out of town, so he won't be back in time.\" \"OK\" Joon replied, smiling back. Sam still hated the lying to her, but at least she wasn't giving him the evil eye to make him feel worse. \"Do you wanna get some tapioca and ice cream at Ruthy's before you go to work?\" Joon asked. Sam thought about this for a moment. 'Well, I guess it should be all right. It might look a little strange if I keep avoiding Ruthy' . Sam looked up and nodded his head in agreement. * * * The diner was buzzing with customers during the lunch time rush. \"Hello Joon. Sam\" Ruthy greeted delightedly. Joon waved, while Sam merely nodded in acknowledgment - his attempt at looking discrete. Ruthy ushered them to their usual spot and pulled out a pencil from behind her ear. \"So let-me-guess\" Ruthy screwed her face into an expression of feigned concentration. \"Tapioca for Joon - hold the raisins - \" The very word 'tapioca' caused Sam to recoil uneasily and turn slightly green \" - and an ice cream sundae for Sam?\" Ruthy asked. Joon clapped her hands and laughed \"Wow Ruthy, how'd you guess?\" Ruthy gave them a playful smile before going around the back. When Ruthy returned with their order, Ruthy quickly whispered something in Sam's ear while Joon was facing the other way - assuming she wouldn't notice. Sam gave a small nod. Unknown to Sam and Ruthy, Joon had heard a single word - \"tonight\". What could this mean - and why was Ruthy whispering to Sam? Joon decided to let it go . . . for now. Watching Joon eating her tapioca gave Sam the urge to puke into his hat, but he fought it off. 'I don't think I'll ever be able to look at tapioca the same way ever again' Sam thought miserably. As Sam and Joon were leaving the diner, Sam gave Ruthy a final knowing glance before closing the door behind him. * * * Sam and Joon were sitting together watching Billy Wilder's \"Some Like It Hot\". Sam quoting every single line along with the film may annoy some - but not Joon. After all, Sam's Marilyn Monroe impression was a sight to behold! They were at the part where Jack Lemmon's character (who's in drag) tells Tony Curtis (who's also in drag) he's getting married - Jack Lemmon : I'm engaged! Tony Curtis : Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl? Jack : I am. (He sings and vigorously shakes maracas.) Joon turned to see Sam wildly shaking his imaginary maracas. Joon shook her head with amusement. \"What time did you say you had to be at work?\" Joon inquired. Sam immediately stopped shaking his maracas and pulled out his pocket watch. \"Oh, uh . . . right about now!\" Sam leapt out of the chair and dashed out the door. A few seconds later, ran into the apartment again - backwards, grabbed is hat, cane and coat - waved, and continued forward again. Joon sighed and started to giggle. She stopped the video - knowing Sam wouldn't like to miss a minute - even though he had seen it God-knows-how-many-times. Joon decided to go do some painting for a while. After all - she liked her privacy when painting. * * * After spending a few hours painting, Joon was feeling a little lonely. 'Hmmm, I wonder if Ruthy's home? ' Joon silently considered. 'Maybe I might go pay her a little visit. It's been a while since we've had a proper chat' . Joon stood up and placed her paintbrush in a jar of water, and made her way to the bedroom for a clean change of clothes. Feeling refreshed, she grabbed her jacket and closed the door, not bothering to lock it - as she was only going down the hall. * * * As Joon approached Ruthy's apartment, she could faintly hear soft whispers, murmurs. Joon cautiously put her ear against the door and was shocked to hear what sounded like Sam! \"OH, do you want me to pull it out? I mean, do you want to see it?\" Joon heard Sam ask. \"Oh yes Sam, go right ahead. I've been waiting all week for this!\" There was a slight pause, next Joon could hear Ruthy's gasp of amazement. \"Oh Sam!\" Ruthy crooned 'Goodness, it's magnificent! Something you should be very proud of!\" Another pause. Joon wondered what they were talking about. She knew it was wrong to eavesdrop, but well . . . she had a right - Sam had lied to her! \"It's bigger than you described\" Ruthy continued. \"I don't know if it'll fit!\" \"Well, it's got to!\" Sam replied desperately. \"I guess we could try - but it would be a tight squeeze\" Ruthy answered. Joon gasped softly. 'NO! This could NOT be what it sounded like. NO WAY! Sam and Ruthy?! Was that even possible to consider?! \"So Sam, how big is it exactly then?\" Ruthy inquired \"Um, I think, ah, about 9 inches - give or take\" Sam answered, somewhat casually. Joon couldn't hear what happened next, but as far as Joon was concerned - she didn't need to . . . \"You know, we have to make our visits a little shorter, I really think Joon might be starting to suspect something\" Sam told Ruthy. \"Well, it'll be all right. It'll be out in the open soon, and you'll have nothing to be worried about\" Ruthy assured him. Joon could hear items being shuffled around. Shocked, Joon ran back to the apartment, tears beginning to well in her eyes. She raced into the bathroom and locked the door - not wishing to face Sam. Joon stared deeply into the bathroom mirror, attempting to calm herself. 'OK, don't jump to conclusions, you know, maybe, it just SOUNDED bad . . . REALLY bad. Yes, that's it . . . no it's not. Maybe, he doesn't love me anymore! ' Tears began to stream down her face. Joon turned on the shower, hoping the sound of running water would disguise her devastated sobs, and hopefully wash away her immense sadness. After her shower, Joon reasoned calmly, knowing what she had to do. She would play detective to find out, once and for all - what on EARTH was happening![Chapter 6] Disclaimer - Um, just refer to previous chapters. Wow, almost 20 reviews! Thanks everyone - even the .er, constructive criticisms - sorry, I'll try to do better . \"You've got to do better Gilbert.\" Oh, and I'll try not to write-lots-of-words-with-dashes too! Well - maybe a few . . . *laughs evilly! By the time Sam poked his head in the bedroom door, Joon appeared to be asleep. 'Aww, my sweet Joon. You look so beautiful, just lying be careful not to wake her !' Sam thought as he gazed at her with quiet admiration. Sam quickly crept to the wardrobe to change into his pajamas, and slipped quietly into bed. Just as Sam was drifting off to sleep . . . \"Ouch!\" Sam cried out softly, rubbing his head. Joon's arm remained motionless on top of Sam's head. 'Hmmm, I wonder what that girl's dreaming about' Sam pondered thoughtfully. Sam carefully placed Joon's arm back by her side. He then gently laid his head back on the soft, inviting pillow. About 20mins later, Joon once again whacked Sam over the head. \"Ow! This is getting to be just like in Buster Keaton's \"My Wife's Relations\" - when he keeps whacking his wife in the next bed. Maybe THAT'S what she's dreaming about. Sam decided better not chance it and decided to sleep on the couch. Joon slipped a quick peak at Sam as he sleepily trudged towards the couch. 'Hmmm, serves him right !' Joon thought with a triumphant grin. 'I'm gonna get to the bottom of this tomorrow !' . . . * * * Sam attempted to stifle a yawn as he stretched. He spun his legs down from the upper region of the couch and shuffled downstairs. Joon looked up at him as she was making a \"special\" breakfast smoothie for Sam - milk, raw eggs, sardines, hot sauce, and strawberry yogurt (for flavour). She smiled pleasantly at Sam, handing him the stinky concoction. Sam gulped uneasily at the sight of the freakish beverage. \"Um, hi Joon, what's in today's breakfast?\" Sam inquired - slightly afraid of the answer. \"Oh, it's a surprise!\" Joon replied mischievously. Sam braced himself as he attempted to swallow the \"special\" smoothie down. 'OH MY GOD! I think I'm gonna be sick - again !' Sam winced but put on a brave, happy face. \"Mmmn\" Sam managed to murmur, nodding his head wildly as if it were the greatest drink on earth. Joon beamed back and replied \"Oh, well you better drink up Sam, or you'll be late for work\". Sam glanced up at the clock. Ah ha! An escape! Placing the glass on a coaster, Sam quickly spun around towards the bedroom. \"Well? Drink up!\" Sam stopped dead in his tracks, and spun back to face Joon. \"Uh, I'll finish drinking it . . . uh, as soon as I get dressed!\" Sam threw Joon a quick smile before dashing out of the room as quick as possible. While Sam was in the shower whistling \"The Charleston\" he began to seriously ponder over Joon's peculiar behavior this morning. Also wondering 'did I taste strawberry flavored fish in that drink?! ' All of a sudden - \"Oooh! Cold-cold-cold!!\" It was as if the shower had turned to ice! Sam leapt out of the shower and into Joon's fuzzy pink angora bathrobe. Ahhh! - Soft cozy warmness! Meanwhile, Joon finally relented and turned off the hot water tap in the kitchen. 'I wonder whether he has to work any \"extra shifts\" today' Joon wondered sarcastically. 'Bet he's planning to see his precious Ruthy. Why does she need Sam anyway? She's got Benny. Sam's mine!' Joon started murmuring softly to herself. As Sam came in to view, Joon stopped immediately. \"Uh, I said I'd do another extra shift today, so I'll see you later, OK?\" Sam informed her. Joon simply looked up at Sam and quirked an eyebrow. Deciding to change the subject - \"Have a nice shower?\" Joon asked innocently. Sam looked back at her and nodded weakly. Worried he might spark off anything else, Sam placed his hat on his head and dashed out the door. * * * At lunch time, Joon once again decided to make her way down town. As Joon strolled down the street, she noticed strange looks from the people around her. 'What?! Haven't they ever seen a girl in a trench coat - and a fake mustache before? Everyone knows, if you're going to investigate someone, you should wear a disguise!' Joon shook her head in sad disbelief. God, some people were naïve! Joon observed Sam's video shop from a safe distance. Right on time, Sam left the shop for his lunch break. Joon continued to trail Sam until they were in front of Ruthy's diner. 'What a surprise !' Joon thought bitterly. Joon watched in amazement, as Sam went straight past the front door! Joon paused. Where is he going?! Allowing a few seconds to pass, Joon resumed her trailing. She crouched behind a bin. He was going in the back way. Why is he going that way for? Sam knocked on the door three times, and started to fiddle with his hat nervously. Ruthy met him at the door, both of them anxiously glanced around before she ushered him inside . . . Ah yes, it's all falling into place . . . Thanks again to those who took the time to review! Oh, did you all catch the less-than-subtle Ed Wood reference?[Chapter 7] Disclaimer - refer to previous chapters Hi everyone! Thanks HEAPS to all the kind/wonderful/awesome people who: 1 - Took the time to read my story; and 2 - Actually reviewed it! YAY! I love reading reviews - especially when they're for me!!!! Ah, Johnny's the best! *Sigh. Don't you think they should have called the movie \"SAM\" because no one I know actually cares about Benny . . . or Joon. \"Hi Ruthy! Well, I made it\" Sam greeted, somewhat nervously. \"Sam, there's been a change of plans, I think we should go to my apartment instead. OK?\" Sam bobbed his head in agreement. Sam spun around and held the door open for Ruthy, who grabbed her coat and smiled back thanks Sam!\" Sam gentlemanly tipped his hat in response. * * * Meanwhile, Joon carefully peeked over the garbage bin lid. BANG! Whoops-a-daisy! \"What was that?!\" Joon heard Sam ask. \"Probably just a stray cat\" Ruthy replied. Shrugging, Sam closed the door, and held up his arm, which Ruthy linked with hers. Joon could vaguely hear Sam whistling \"We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz.\" Joon silently leaped up, adjusted her mustache, and began trailing once more. * * * Joon watched jealously as the man she loved followed Ruthy into her apartment. 'My goodness, he follows her around like a happy little puppy dog ! But he's MY happy little puppy dog damn-it! ' Joon thought bitterly. After the two were safely inside, Joon snuck behind a tree. She was still too far away to hear what was going on inside, but she could see a slight silhouette through the curtains. She crouched on the ground and watched for a while. What are they doing ? Joon thought tensely. Unfortunately, her question was soon to be answered. From what she could see, Ruthy and Sam where getting a little TOO close to one another. Oh my God! Joon whispered softly in disbelief. Joon quickly tiptoed to Ruthy's front door in an attempt to hear what was going on inside. Through the loud clanging noises, all Joon could make out was \"quick Sam\" and \"trousers off\". Holy crap! Joon REALLY couldn't believe her ears this time! Maybe it's about time I paid Ruthy a little visit . . . * * * Amongst the rustling inside the apartment, Ruthy and Sam stopped dead at the sound of three little knocks on the door. Ruthy cleared her voice \"Um, who is it?\" she called out. \"It's me, Joon\". Holy crap-on-a-cracker! Sam and Ruthy looked at each other with panic. \"Ah, I'll just be a minute\" Ruthy replied. Sam looked as if he were about to faint. He looked around frantically. \"What-do-I-do?!\" Sam whispered frantically whilst beginning to hyperventilate. \"Quick, grab your pants!\" Ruthy mouthed. Sam rapidly nodded, grabbed his trousers and rushed into her broom cupboard . At the same time Ruthy fixed her hair, and opened the door. \"Why hello Joon!\" Ruthy greeted. \"Hi\" Joon replied back. \"Mind if I come in?\" Before Ruthy could answer Joon stepped over the threshold. \"Ah, what can I do for you?\" Ruthy asked, puzzled. \"Oh, I don't know. I guess I was lonely. Thought I'd come over for a chat, woman to woman.\" Joon replied in a syrupy voice. The two chattered for the next hour. * * * Sam had never been so afraid in his life! He couldn't believe the coincidence of timing - how Joon happened to drop in, at exactly the same time HE had. Sam was getting a little tired from standing up for so long - and bored. He had already silently recited the entire script of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town. ' Hmmm . . . Gosh, I hope Joon leaves soon, this cupboard is getting a little on the hot side' . Sam lent against the door, straining to hear what was going on. Unfortunately, he leaned a little TOO far. The door had not been properly shut, and out fell Sam - who was still . . . trouser-less. Oh dear. Joon gaped over in horror. Although she had known he was here, just visualizing him - and without any pants was just TOO much for her. She leapt out of her chair, scowled at Ruthy and stormed over towards Sam. \"Uh, hi Joon! It's not what you think . . . really!\" Sam managed to stammer. Joon just glared furiously into Sam's eyes, \"Why?!\" she demanded loudly. SLAP!!!! Before giving him the world's largest bitch-slap! Even Ruthy winced. Joon rushed out of the apartment before Sam could answer. Sam attempted to chase after her, to no avail. Just as Sam reached the apartment door Joon slammed it in his face. Sam just stared at the door sadly, not even noticing the old lady across the hall staring at him. Sam knew he better let Joon calm down a little before trying to talk to her again, but he was incredibly worried what she might do . . . * * * Joon searched for a photograph of Sam, but could only find one - a recent one taken at the park only a few weeks ago. Joon stared at the photo intently. 'What is wrong with me - besides being ever so slightly mentally ill? Angry tears had already started teeming down her face. Joon purposefully paced towards the hot plate in the kitchen and held the photograph over it, until Sam's face began to bubble, and a hole formed where the man she loved once was. Nonchalantly, she tossed the burning photo to the ground . . . There you go - cliffhanger - at least I hope it sounded like one. I really appreciate reviews - so go on, press that little purple button! - waves Sam's cane in front of potential viewers - wink-wink.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: Same as all the other chapters blah blah blah Another gigantic thank you to those wonderful people who take the time to read and review my story. Ah, the drama, (well hopefully it has some). Hmmm, on with the story. Sam turned slowly, and trudged back to Ruthy's apartment to retrieve his trousers. 'Gee, I hope Joon will be able to forgive me, it wasn't supposed to happen like this' Sam thought sorrowfully. Ruthy looked up from her couch as Sam entered the doorway, his shoulders slumped, his heart on the floor. \"Oh, I'm so sorry Sam\" Ruthy said quietly, patting Sam on the shoulder. Sam went to the tiny cupboard where he had been hiding for the last hour and pulled on his trousers. \"Joon . . . she won't understand!\" Sam said softly, looking as if he were close to tears. Ruthy had never felt so rotten in her life - it was her fault, two of her best friends were in so much pain. \"Sam, you should go right over there and try to explain everything.\" Sam just shook his head \"It's no use, I don't think she'll listen\". Ruthy pondered for a moment \"well, no matter what, you better go over there, when she gets . . . agitated, who knows what he might do!\" Sam's usually doe-like eyes widened in horror. Sam dashed back towards their apartment without bothering to pick up his cane. As Sam approached the door. He immediately sensed something was wrong. Sam retreated a few metres and barged the door open. The apartment was slowly filling with a light grey smoke. 'OH NO, JOON!' Sam pulled his shirt collar up, so it covered his mouth and nose. Sam courageously made his way through the growing blanket of smoke to find Joon. Sam threw open the door to Joon's art room, where Joon was sitting on the ground, rocking wildly back and forth while murmuring softly to herself. She was facing the opposite direction and didn't hear Sam come in. \"Joon?\" Sam cried out panic stricken, ripping the shirt from his face. Joon immediately spun around to face Sam, she glared at him with eyes full of hurt and hatred. Sam gazed apologetically at her, but Joon didn't care. \"Leave me alone!\" Joon screamed at him. Sam attempted to look calm, even though their apartment was filling with smoke. \"Joon\" he started, taking his hat off as he slowly inched towards her. \"Uh, do you think we could maybe talk about this outside, where it's not so smoky? Please?\" Sam stared intently at her. Joon stood up on slightly wobbly legs and began gesturing wildly as she spoke \"What is there to talk about? I saw you . . . with Ruthy . . . WITH NO PANTS ON!!!! - \" Joon paused to cough \"I've seen you, all week trying to see Ruthy! You lied about - \" before Joon could finish her sentence, she collapsed. Sam rushed over to her crumpled body, keeling to pick her up. Sam was beginning to feel a little light-headed, but managed to carry Joon outside. Ruthy looked out of her door \"Call the fire brigade - and an ambulance\" Sam cried out to Ruthy. She nodded, and rushed to her phone. Sam kicked the front door open and laid Joon on the soft grass out front of their apartment block. Sam gently brushed the hair out of Joon's eyes and began to sob. 'Please be all right, please!' Sam silently prayed. * * * When the ambulance arrived, Joon was placed on a stretcher and moved into the ambulance. Sam followed sorrowfully, and sat beside her, holding her hand. Sam murmured in an inaudible whisper \"I'm so sorry Joon. I love you\". Sorry, this one was only a short chapter - probably better for you poor readers, ay? Hope it was all right. I think there are only a few chapters left now . . . *sob - All will be revealed![Chapter 9] Disclaimer: Do I REALLY have to write one for EVERY chapter? For anyone who is still (for some reason) reading this story and actually cares what's happening, sorry for taking so loooong! Whew, all this evil homework really takes up a lot of time. Oh my gosh - I just saw Once Upon A Time In Mexico today, it was sooooo awesome! How damn hot was he?! - Even when his eyes were . . . err . . . drilled out (mega ouchyness!). Lets face it, he still looked damn good! *sigh* ( Once again, thank you to those who have read and reviewed my story! Sam stared at the ambulance with tears welling in his eyes as it pulled away from the driveway. Sam felt that it was all his fault that this had happened in the first place. He didn't know what he would do if Joon . . . if she . . . Sam refused to even think about it. ' No, she'll ... she'll be all right...I hope'. Sam leaned back against a large oak tree, sinking slowly to the ground in sorrowful depression. He couldn't hold back the tears any longer. And for a while, Sam just sat there, his face buried in his folded arms - until Ruthy slowly and cautiously made her way across the lawn towards him. Ruthy didn't want to crowd him, and figured Sam probably didn't want to see her as it was, in her opinion, all her fault Joon was in hospital. \"Sam\" Ruthy called out softly, \"Sam?\" Sam rubbed his eyes and looked up at her, \"Come on, I'll drive you to the hospital. Would you like that?\" She held out her hand, which Sam hesitantly took. Sam dusted off his trousers and Ruthy handed him his hat and cane. He gave a small, weak smile as he graciously accepted them. As they trudged languidly to Ruthy's car, she tenderly placed a reassuring arm around Sam's shoulder. Sam looked at her \"What if she doesn't want to see us? See me?\" Sam asked with a trembling voice. \"Well, we'll get in there somehow. . .\" * * * Sam followed Ruthy as she flung open the doors to the hospital and approached the receptionist with a determined glint in her eye. \"We're here to see Juniper Pearl. What room is she in?\" The woman looked up at Ruthy and inquired \"family or friends?\" \"Friends\" Ruthy replied. The woman pulled out a clip board and skimmed over it quickly. \"I'm sorry, family only\". With that, she turned away and went back to what she had been doing. Sam turned to Ruthy, biting his lip anxiously, mouthing 'what-do-we-do-now?' \"But I've GOT to see her, I . . . I have to explain - \" \"I'm sorry\" the woman responded coldly, cutting off Sam mid-sentence \"there is nothing I can do\". Sam and Ruthy exchanged knowing glances, nodding secretively. In a sudden rage, Ruthy slammed her hand on the desk \"Listen lady\" she began in a bearly restrained voice \"just tell us what room she's in, all right?!\" Before the woman could answer, Sam began talking crazily to himself \"He was mine, HE WAS MINE!!!!\" Sam melodramatically whipped his head around wildly \"NO!\" he answered shaking his head \"Cindy you're sick, Cindy you need help\" The woman backed slowly out of her chair and dashed to the phone located on the back wall. Taking the opportune moment, Ruthy grabbed the clip board and scanned it hastily before the woman turned around. \"No Cindy . . . AHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\" Sam screamed at the top of his lungs as he mimed stabbing himself in an insane frenzy. Ruthy turned and winked at Sam, who immediately stopped. \"What the?! Are you all right young man?\" the woman asked, frowning slightly. \"Mmm hmm\" Sam replied innocently. The woman just stood there in shock as Sam gentlemanly tipped his hat, and left the hospital arm in arm with Ruthy. * * * Once outside, Sam and Ruthy strolled nonchalantly down the stairs and moved towards a gigantic tree. Gesturing towards the roots, they sat down to discuss their line of action. Ruthy shook her head \"Why couldn't they have taken Joon to the hospital where Benny's friend works? Would have been a lot easier.\" Sam nodded in agreement. \"You're never going to let me live that whole Prom Queen Mutilator thing down, are you?\" Ruthy laughed. Sam grinned sheepishly. \"So, uh . . what room is she in?\" Sam inquired as Ruthy checked her watch. \"186. I think it might be the one up there\" Ruthy pointed to the room on the top floor next to the tree they were sitting on. Sam craned his neck upward. \"Aw, it'll a piece of cake! Carrot I hope. Mmm...\" Ruthy gently took Sam's hand in hers and gazed deeply into his eyes. \"Sam, I really am so terribly sorry about all this. It is all my - \" Sam held a finger to her lips before she could utter another word. \"Please don't. It isn't your fault Ruthy. Really.\" Sam replied softly, smiling sadly. Ruthy nodded, feeling a little relieved that Sam didn't hate her. Now she only had to confront Joon . . . All in due time. \"Come on, we better get back soon if we . . . if, you, are to do this thing. You better have a quick bite down at the diner first, then you'll be ready\" Ruthy said, wiping her eyes a little. Sam gingerly got up from the ground, and together they once more made their way to Ruthy's car. Just as he was about to get in the car, Sam turned once more to glance back at the hospital. 'I'll be back soon Joon, you'll see . . . \" Oooh ahhh the polt thickens, all will be revealed . . . On a random note - how fantastically slendiferous is Big Fish, and Once Upon A Time In Mexico?! Love it!!!! *Sigh* Oh my gosh! They just announced the Oscars . . . and Johnny didn't win. The academy only care about artsy fartsy films - OK, not really, because the awesome Lord of the Rings just won 11 awards, but still . . . it would have been heaps cool of Johnny could've won. But there is no doubt he will receive many more Oscar nods in the future![Chapter 10] Hey everyone! How awesome is the Pirates Of The Caribbean dvd?! Did everyone catch the spiffy Benny and Joon reference on the deleted scenes? \"pity about the French, totally obsessed with raisins - humiliated grapes really . . . \" - how damn cute is that?! *sorry, that was probably HIGHLY misquoted, but hey - you all know what I mean . . .right? . . . *sigh* Less than ONE week till Secret Window - I'm sooo excited!!! All the exams are over for now - and I can FINALLY do some (dodgy) writing. Massive thanks to the kind people who bother to read AND REVIEW (wink-wink-knudge-knudge) my story!! Jack cookies to all of you! Sorry for yammering on for so long, on with the story. Disclaimer: You all know, that NO ONE in all of fanfictionland ACTUALLY owns ANY of the cool characters . . . or anything mentioned. Because if we did- why would we hang out here? When you could hang out with Sam, Captain Jack, or Agent Sands *me-ow!) ( The plan was simple. \"Are you sure you want to stay there, I mean, wouldn't it be easier to just. . . I don't know, go near midnight or something?\" Ruthy inquired skeptically. \"No\" Sam shook his head, glancing up from his macaroni cheese \"I want to be with Joon, to stay by her side - even if she doesn't know I'm there.\" Ruthy understood completely, and was overwhelmed by Sam's loyalty and devotion to Joon. \"OK then. Well, we better get things organised\". Sam gulped down the rest of the macaroni and helped Ruthy clear up. A few hours later, armed with a backpack and some cookies for good measure, Sam quietly got out of Ruthy's car, bid her farewell, and crept softly towards some bushes outside the hospital where his beloved Joon was. Hearing a noise, Sam leapt behind a bush. A few seconds later, he peeked over the top. Left, right . . . left again. OK, the coast was clear. Rising cautiously, Sam snuck over to the large oak tree. Sam glanced up. Whew, that's what I call a tree! Hope no-one minds if I borrow it for a while . . . Sam smiled suddenly, remembering one of the very first things Joon had said to him when they first met - \"your out of your tree\" she had stated. Sam had simply shrugged, replying \"It's not my tree\". Ah, my sweet Joon . . . whoa! Snap out of it! You've got things to do! Sam silently told himself. Now, the tree . . . Sam rolled up his sleeves dramatically, and spat into his hands, and rubbed them together. About a minute later, Sam was near the top of the tree, comfortably perched on a branch which was right outside Joon's window. Of course, he wouldn't cross the branch which connected to her window until she was asleep. After all, she was pretty mad at him . . . but he couldn't actually remember why. Oh yes, the sight of him without trousers . . . in Ruthy's cupboard may have possibly given Joon the wrong idea . . . Did it really look THAT bad? Hmmm, actually, it probably did. What was that thing she had said right before . . . tears started to well in his eyes again . . . she collapsed? Sam scraped his brain . . . now he remembered - \"I've seen you, all week trying to see Ruthy! You lied about - \" Sam felt overwrought with guilt. The sheer weight of it would have been enough to drag any man down. But not Sam. Not today. Because, well . . . he was going to make things better - the way they had been before any of this mess began. Sam gave a small nod - for personal assurance. Sam dutifully sat in the tree, waiting for the light to turn off in Joon's room. It was about 9:00pm. Sam was blanketed by the pitch blackness of night. The night air was laced with a slight chill, and was completely silent except for the barely audible chorus of crickets chirping away below him. Sam stifled a yawn, just as the soft light in the room went out - oh, here we go. She usually took only half an hour before she would fall into a deep sleep. * * * Joon couldn't help but think of Sam. Her sweet, charming little Sam - THE BASTARD!!! No, even though she had caught him with Ruthy - with NO PANTS on . . . she just couldn't bring herself to hate him. Well, not yet anyway. But oh - she could. All in due time. She knew she wasn't being paranoid this time. She had seen him, with her own two eyes - numerous times when he was supposed to be \"at work\". ' Yeah, likely' Joon thought bitterly. She wondered what he was doing now. Probably with his DARLING Ruthy, sipping martinis and watching \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", well this fiesty feline would like to scratch Ruthy's eyes out - when I get my hands on her... How could Sam do this? I mean REALLY? He has never seemed attracted to Ruthy, or anyone else for that matter before. . . But Joon knew, you bet she did, it was because she was crazy. ISN'T IT! Poor crazy Joon, the loony-tune! ' Well, I can't blame him, Ruthy is very pretty - especially when she's not working' Joon considered resentfully. Joon attempted to shove these thoughts from her mind as she gradually drifted off . . . * * * Sam pulled out a flash light from his backpack, shining it on his pocket watch. It's probably been long enough. Sam tossed the light back in his bag, and pulled out his present. Deciding it would be easier to leave the bag, he started to inch towards the connecting branch to Joon's window. But wait. How was he supposed to climb across a branch AND carry his present instantaneously? Sam pulled back from the edge and pondered. Scratching his head . . . HEAD - that's it!! Slowly he began to move across the branch again, but with a SLIGHT modification. The present now sat on top of his head - with is hat propped on top of the present! Sam couldn't even conceive what a funny site he must have looked, he was too busy concentrating NOT falling from a tree branch several metres from the ground. ' Oh boy' Sam thought silently , 'what have I got myself into? ' Tiny beads of perspiration began to form on his brow. Finally, after 5 agonizing minutes - it was over. There was a slight gap between the two curtains in front of Joon's window, which allowed Sam to peek through. Sam's heart warmed as he gazed at her, sleeping so peacefully. He stole but only an moment, before laying down his gift, and climbing back across the branch. The plan was simply to leave the gift and hope Joon responds. But Sam decided to deviate slightly from the original plan. He really did want to stay be her side, but realised he had better leave before morning came - as he was fairly certain, the hospital wouldn't approve of strange people hanging outside patients rooms. Plus, the nurse who would open the window might get a bit of a fright if she found him there. Anyway, he couldn't face Joon, not yet . . . Hi fellow fanfictioners - thanks for reading, and don't hesitate in clicking that little purple button - you know you want to . . . Thanks again everyone! OUATIM kicks ass! - I finally saw El Mariachi too, that and Desperado were awesome!!! You should really check them out if you haven't already![Chapter 11] Hey everyone! Hope you all had a nice Easter! Oh my Christ! I just got Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights\" and \"The Circus\" - they are two of the most incredibly splendiferous, fantastical movies I have EVER seen!!! After 5 years of wanting to see these films - I finally have them! Yay - Jack cookies and martinis all around - on the house. 13/4/04 *NEWS FLASH - I just saw Secret Window yesterday - Oh my golly gosh, it was sooooo awesome! The twist was really neat. Can I ask everyone's opinion on something? At the end, Johnny actually combs his hair and changes his glasses from thick(ish) plastic to wire frames. Am I the only one who thought he looked WWAAYY hotter with the whole disheveled, unkempt look? And looked better with his original glasses? Hmmmm . . . .*Sigh* I loved that movie, I really need to see it again! Sorry about that, but I was too excited! Disclaimer - We all know I DON'T own Sam, all though I may one day *sigh* (well, I can dream can't I?) OK, well here comes chapter 11 . . . Sam had ended up getting quite snuggled up and almost comfortable on the rough branch of the gigantic oak tree. He had been dreaming of Joon's sunny smile and her breakfast smoothies, so when he woke up, he was not pleased to be interrupted of such sweet images. Sam twitched his nose and stretched his arms out lazily. He wasn't sure how long he had been asleep. Sam sleepily dug his hand in his pocket for his pocket watch. After rummaging about a for a minute, panic set in. Where was it? Sam's eyes flicked open and found his answer. The first evidence of daylight had set in, which allowed Sam to see what he was face to face with - \"CHIPMUNK!!!\" Sam cried out, clamping his hand over his mouth immediately. An evil chipmunk, who had his filthy little paws on his pocket watch! Chipmunks . . . Sam shuddered. Chipmunks equaled bad. He had had some . . . bad experiences with chipmunks in the past, and this little critter wasn't helping. Calming himself, Sam slowly reached his hand over to the chipmunk. \"C'mon little guy, give Sam back his pocket watch\" Sam called softly in a sing- song voice. The chipmunk simply crinkled his nose at him and scampered away in the opposite direction. ' No-no-no! ' Sam pleaded silently. Sighing, Sam fixed his hat firmly on his head and pulled on his backpack, making chase to the nasty little chipmunk. Higher and higher he climbed, faster and faster. When Sam was finally once again face to face with the chipmunk, he struck an idea. He reached up and pulled out a cookie from under his hat. The chipmunk stopped and stared. \"Yeah, you like cookies, don't you little fella\". Sam leant over offering the tempting cookie. The chipmunk scrambled over and started to take the cookie. Sam cleared his throat, glaring at the chipmunk. The chipmunk looked up and dropped the watch back in Sam's hand before snatching the cookie and scurrying away. Sam sighed with relief. 'Whew, that was a close one' he thought with a smile. That smile, soon left, as Sam heard a distinct cracking of wood. ' Oh boy' Sam thought as he fell a very long way down back to earth. \"!\" Sam thanked his lucky stars that the gardener had gone a little overboard with the hosing, which had made the ground nice and soft - and incredibly muddy. \"Ouch ouch\". Sam cried out as he gingerly got up. 'Good, my legs still work. That's always a plus'. Unfortunately, Sam was not out of the clear yet. The racket that he had made had drawn the attention of hospital security. \"Hey you!\" a guard yelled across the lawn from the door. ' OK, this is probably my cue to exit - stage left !' Sam shoved the watch back in his pocket and dashed comically towards the fence, leaping over it in a single bound. * * * Joon woke with a start. ' What on earth is happening out there?!' Joon thought irritably. Sighing, she sat up and swung her legs around to the side of the bed, throwing the covers off and padded over to the window, wiping the sleep from her eyes. Joon pulled apart the two curtains to see what was - hey, what is this? Eyeing a small box with a large red ribbon on her window sill, Joon carefully opened her window and cautiously picked the parcel up. Joon inspected the mysterious parcel thoughtfully as she sat back down on her bed. Shrugging, she pulled the red ribbon slowly. The top of the box popped open to reveal a jack-in-the-box, which Joon then proceeded to extract from the box. Now in clear view, she inspected her present. It looked just like the one Sam had given her that day she had kicked him out for cleaning the house - of all things. Joon chuckled, then paused. No, it was going to take a LOT more than cute do-dads to make Joon forgive him. 'But, I guess it wouldn't hurt to wind it up just once' she thought playfully. Holding the jack-in-the-box firmly with her left hand, cranking with the right, she grinned as box tinkled the \"Pop Goes The Weasel\" song, then POP! The lid popped opened to reveal the cute, brightly coloured jester inside - but something was different . . . there was a small note sticky taped to the little jester's hand. Frowning, Joon ripped the note from it's hand and opened it. Joon gave a soft gasp, and her icy demeanor began to thaw a immediately. The note said: \"PLEZE CUM TO THE PARKE AT 2 PM\" and was composed in Sam's unique childish scrawl. Joon knew that Sam only wrote when absolutely necessary, and when he did - it was usually for a pretty good reason. Joon glanced at the clock, 'boy, it's only 6am !' Joon yawned and settled back in her bed. She would be allowed to leave in a few hours, better get a little rest before . . . Joon had already drifted back into a deep sleep, but she still held the tiny note safely in her hand. A small smile creased her face as she began to dream of . . . Sam. * * * After losing the security guard, Sam had decided to go for a brief walk through the park. Sam wished he had his cane right about now, as his legs seemed to be doing their own thing, causing him to sway uneasily as he moved - plus, with the mud drying on his clothes - it was getting a little hard to move. He had left his cane with Ruthy, thinking he wouldn't need it in the tree. Sam shook his head - never again. Sighing, he hoped that Joon would come at 2 o'clock. He didn't know what he would do if she didn't. He had wanted to write the note himself, instead of Ruthy. It would have been considerably easier to read if Ruthy HAD wrote the note, but it wouldn't have been as . . . personal. Sam wanted to let Joon know, that he was sincere and really did want to make things better. Sam tipped his hat as two early morning joggers ran by. Sam wondered why they looked at him funny. Oh well. By the time he reached Ruthy's diner, Sam was in dire need of some breakfast - he had given his only snack to the evil little chipmunk. Ruthy was just wiping over the tables before going home - and before the majority of customers would come in for breakfast. Sam flung open the doors to the diner exhaustedly. Ruthy paused, looking Sam up and down. \"Ah, what happened to you?\" Ruthy asked, trying to hide an amused smile. \"Chipmunk\" Sam replied with a shudder. Ruthy quirked a confused eyebrow. Sam staggered over to the table before collapsing onto a nearby stool. Ruthy rushed over, a concerned expression on her face. Sam lifted his head from the table, \"Fear... Fear... Utter fear. Chipmunks! Chipmunks scare me. That's all I'm going to say.\" Ruthy nodded sympethetically and handed Sam his cane, which he gratefully took. \"I'll go get you some breakfast. All right?\" Sam nodded. When Sam could hear Ruthy rattling things in the kitchen, Sam quickly gave his cane a quick hug \"I'll never go anywhere without you EVER AGAIN\" Sam whispered. \"Did you say something?\" Ruthy called out. \"Nope\" Sam called back. Clearing his throat, he leant his cane beside his chair. Ruthy came out with a with a bowl of Captain Crunch, and some paper towels. \"Ah . . .so, how did it go?\" Ruthy inquired. Sam simply gave a weary thumbs up. Just as Sam was about to eat a spoonful of cereal, Ruthy grabbed his face, turned it towards her, and wiped it carefully with the paper towels. \"That's a little better. You looked like you were having an Al Jolsen moment there\" Ruthy said with a laugh. \"The front of your clothes are a little . . . uh, dirty. I'll see if there is something out back we can put you in for now\" Sam just smiled. Half an hour later, Ruthy drove them home, Sam was wearing an large old potato sack with holes in the sides for arms. Ruthy shrugged \"It's all I had, unless you wanted to wear my pink waitress uniform home\" Sam thought about this for a moment . . . Well, there you go. Golly, I think there is only a couple of chapters left. I'll be sad, I've had great fun writing this. What could I do next? I'd like to stick to Johnny movies, but I don't know which one to do. There are way too many POTC one's - and what I mean by that is, I'd never be able to measure up to some of the great stories that are already out there. Plus, I like to fill Johnny fan fiction niches - like Benny and Joon. So if anyone has any ideas, please tell me - because I'm unoriginal and very indecisive - sometimes I have to ask my friends what flavor juice I should have for lunch. Yes - I am THAT bad. So go ahead, make my day - *gestures towards the little purple button* reviews are great - especially when they are for me. Thanks again for reading![Chapter 12] Disclaimer - Unfortunately I do not own Sam, \"Benny and Joon\" or Buster Keaton's hat. Oh, thanks for all the suggestions for stories everyone! Hmmm, I don't know, I'm kinda leaning towards Don Juan at the moment - only because there is a very short supply out there, and I love the movie! *sigh* wouldn't mind owning Don Juan, especially when he looks suspiciously like Johnny Depp! lol. OK, this chapter I realise is kinda draggy, it was a real pain in the ass to write. Hmm, I decided to pull a \"Kill Bill\" (kick-ass movie!! QT - you're the best!) and split it so I can stretch this story for all it's worth - and because I'm too impatient to think of the rest right now. Alrighty - so please forgive me for screwing the story up! Hope you don't hate it too much! Once they had gotten back to the apartment, Sam had decided he wanted to be alone for a few hours. It was lucky that not all that much had actually been burnt by the fire - mostly just some items in Joon's art room. It was surprising, considering the amount of smoke which had been present at the time. Sam thanked his lucky stars. He decided to take a bath so he wouldn't look like a mud monster, and also, so he could ponder over what was to happen at 2 o'clock. Would it be filled with awkward silences, would it resemble a grand epic showdown - spaghetti western style? More importantly - would Joon forgive him, and would he be allowed to explain his side of the story? These questions swam wildly around in Sam's head as he sat in the frothy bath, with an expression of deep thought etched on his face. ' Well, I guess I should at least try and look presentable for Joon - maybe even wear my spiffy new spats! Fred Astaire wore spats. Everyone likes Fred Astaire!' Sam held his breath as he submerged beneath the frothy bath water. Sam was afraid of taking a shower at the moment - with a cranky Joon on the loose - who may decide to swing by the apartment early, Sam was slightly afraid Joon may pull a \"Psycho\" on him. Sam knew Joon wasn't THAT cranky . . . but still, a bath seemed a less scary option at the moment. Drawing a breath, Sam stole a glance at the bathroom clock. Hmmm, better get ready soon, there was a LOT to do before 2 o'clock. Sam rose from the bath and wrapped a towel around himself as he padded towards the bedroom, leaving a trail of watery footprints behind him. Sifting though his closet, he found the perfect outfit to wear. Actually, it was pretty much what he usually DID wear - except for one thing - the hat. This was Sam's most treasured possession. One genuine hat which was once worn by the great Buster Keaton himself! Sam only wore this on VERY special occasions, or when he needed a little luck. He didn't dare wear it as his everyday hat - as after watching several films had become a great believer in Murphy's Law - if something can go wrong - it will. After all, there are a LOT of birds out there . . . Sam didn't know what he would do if ANYTHING ever happened to this hat. His grandfather had been a prop and costume guy on some of Keaton's early shorts, like \"The High Sign\", and had decided to keep the hat as a memento. Sam gazed lovingly at the hat - if anything would give him luck today - it was this hat. It was like it was blessed! So once Sam was dressed to kill, and dashed down stairs to the kitchen. Sam started madly making sandwiches - peanut butter and banana, honey and asparagus, etc. Once Sam was done with the sandwiches, he grabbed some appetizing fruit and some drinks and placed them carefully into a large cane basket. Sam paused. He was forgetting something. A light bulb went off in his head. He skidded over to the linen press and pulled out a shabby old blanket which faintly reeked of moth balls. Sam reeled back slightly, pulling a face. 'Gee, probably should have aired it first' he realized. \"OK\" he started out loud as he paced back and forth \"we've got food, drinks, a blanket . . .is that it?\" Sam pondered silently for a moment 'Hmmm, I know! I'll get her some flowers on the way, but NOT daisies' he thought with a grin. Satisfied, he grabbed the basket, and his cane and strolled outside. Ruthy was standing by her door. Together, arm-in-arm, they left in the hope of making peace with Joon...or at least something like it... * * * At around noon, Joon was released from the hospital with a clear bill of health. This would give Joon a few hours to consider what was to come. Did Sam honestly think she would forgive him just like that? Simply forget all that she had witnessed over the past week? My God, that little monkey better have a jolly good excuse, or he would be in for a nasty surprise! Joon shook her head, trying to keep it clear of all these powerful emotions and thoughts. ' Calm yourself down Juniper, give Sam a chance. You never know - he might just surprise you' the tiny voice in her head reasoned. \"You're right, maybe SOMEHOW all the things I've seen all week could just be . . .um . . .I don't know, YOU'RE supposed to be the SMART ONE!\" Passers-by stopped and stared in her direction. \"What?! Haven't you ever seen someone talk to themselves before?!\" Joon roared. The passers-by all gulped, and moved at a slightly quicker pace than before. Now, where was I? Ah yes . . .Sam. ' What am I going to do? ' Joon thought desperately as she sat on an old bench. Joon knew she shouldn't be the one moping around - although . . . if Sam and Ruthy WERE \"together\" . . . yep, he SHOULD be the mopey one after all. Joon wasn't actually sure whether she truly believed Sam could ever care for anyone the way he did for Joon. She knew deep down . . . ' no, you DON'T know deep down - if you DID - you would have already made up' the voice nagged. \"I'm so confused\" Joon cried out softly. * * * \"What kind of flowers do you think she would like?\" Sam asked Ruthy thoughtfully \"There's so many to chose from!\" Ruthy frowned \"I remember in 'Kate and Leopold' Leopold was telling Charlie what the different flowers meant, you know - friendship, love . . .hate - I don't think you'd like to give Joon a \"hate\" flower, do you!\" Ruthy said with a small laugh. Sam shook his head fearfully. \"Arg! I'm sorry Sam, I can't remember. Um well, I'd probably stay away from pink carnations, so how about some daisies? They're nice happy flowers!\" Ruthy suggested with a shrug. Sam was about to tell Ruthy of the trouble he had at the park with the evil daisy, but stopped, remembering the bright, sunny smile Joon had wore that day; the sweet laughter which had escaped her lips. \"Yes\" he said slowly \"maybe it might make Joon remember the better times we've had! Thanks Ruthy!\" Sam pulled out his pocket watch and flipped it open. 1:45pm. OK, this was it - time to face the music . . . Wow, is it just me - or did like NOTHING happened in this chapter?! lol - but the NEXT chapter, well, hopefully that's where the REAL action comes in (well, not action literally, but hopefully something which resolves or adds to the plot (or LACK of . . .) Ooh only 65 days until Once Upon A Time In Mexico comes out on dvd! - I am SOOO jealous of all those lucky American and others who've already GOT OUATIM - about a million years ago! *sigh* Well, hopefully my next chapter will be better - if anyone is still reading it! Thanks again everyone who reads and REVIEWS (wink-wink) my story!!! You all rock![Chapter 13] Hey everyone! Oh my goodness, I just came back from \"KILL BILL Vol.2\" it was so incredibly cool/awesome/splendiferous!!! Aww, Quentin Tarantino kicks ass! And Robert Rodriguez - my absolute hero composed the music!!! Can't wait to see Volumes one and two together! How awesome!!! Oh yeah - Disclaimer - I do not own the delectable Mr. Depp, nor the spiffy/spunky characters he plays in his totally awesome movies. *quadruple sigh* Also - if anyone cares, I have decided to start a Secret Window fic (knudge-knudge), although I'm starting to think I should have done a Don Juan one after all . . . Ah well, always next time. Oh, and guess what, I got (fairly) decent marks in my half yearlys!!! My best being Maths (!) who would've thought? Martinis, Jack cookies and Sam's hat ALL AROUND!!! Sorry, I was just really happy! OK, back to the story - this part in the story is supposed to be kinda the climax of the story - hope it's not too much of a ANTI-climax!!! If it is, I well and truly apologize! Oooh, I just realised this is chapter 13 . . . (audience) *ooooh* the evil number 13, hope its not full of bad luck . . .*gulp* Here goes nothing . . . As Sam and Ruthy finally reached the edge of the park, Sam's knees began to buckle. ' The pressure. I can't stand the pressure!!! ' Ruthy turned to Sam, sensing Sam's frantic anxiety. She grabbed his shoulder and turned him towards her. Sam gazed down at the ground, trembling slightly. 'My God! Poor thing. He's an absolute wreck! Pale, tearful and shaking'. Cupping his chin lightly in her hand, she tilted his head so she could make eye contact. Blinking away tears, he looked at her pleadingly \"Ruthy, I don't think I can do this. What if Joon won't forgive me, and she never wants to see me ever again?!\" Ruthy smiled reassuringly \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I think she might be angrier at me . . .\" Ruthy then held Sam in a brief, but tender embrace. She stroked his back affectionately, while whispering into his ear \"everything will be all right\". Sam closed his eyes and leaned his head softly on her shoulder. And for a moment, he felt contentment, as if everything would be just rainbows and lollipops. The moment was shattered as the church bells rang from across the street. 2 o'clock. Sam stood up straight and smiled appreciatively at Ruthy. \"Thank you\" he whispered quietly. Ruthy gently kissed him on the cheek, shaking her head \"I honestly don't deserve your thanks\" she replied, as sadness filled her expression. * * * Joon had arrived at the park at around 1:30pm, and had been sitting on the same bench ever since. She checked her watch 1:55pm. Hmmm, only a couple of minutes to go. ' Just think' the voice in her head began 'Sam'll be able to explain . . . somehow, what has happened . . . ALL THOSE TIMES, and you'll be able to forgive him, and \"make up\" if you know what I mean . . . If not, you could always just pick up someone on the way home . . .' Geez! The voice in her head was sure a dirty little tramp! \"Shut up! It's none of your bloody business!!!\" she yelled at the voice. But she couldn't deny it, she HAD missed Sam... Deciding to see if Sam had happened to come a little early, she eased off the bench and wandered towards the edge of the park. Joon paused with a small gasp and dropped to the ground, crouching behind a bush. Sam! But not JUST Sam. Sam's back was to her, but she could clearly see . . . \"Ruthy - that two timing...!\" she breathed with abhorrence. They were talking, but she couldn't quite hear what they were . . . what the?! 'Oh my God !' she whispered in astonishment. She watched as Ruthy's arms snaked around the man she loved, trapping him in her venomous embrace. Maybe it's not Sam's fault after all - maybe all this is RUTHY'S fault!! Putting him under her evil spell. What about Benny? He wasn't THAT bad, was he? But hey, Sam is one of the most incredibly sweet, charming, handsome . . . Yes. That's got to be it!' Joon was about to get up, when the worst possible thing happened - well, second worst thing, if you count finding Sam trouser-less in Ruthy's apartment - she KISSED him. That bitch is kissing my sweet, innocent Sam!!! ' Why don't you go and screw him RIGHT in FRONT of me next time? Huh?! ' This was well and truly the final straw. Time to end this thing once and for all . . . * * * Sam raised a hand to shield his eyes from the glaring sun as he scanned for Joon's familiar face. \"Where could she - \" Sam was cut off by the appearance of Joon. Boy, did she look cranky! Sam smiled sweetly as Joon approached. Approached isn't quite the word to describe it. More like STORMED towards them. \"Uh hi, uh Joon?\" Sam called out uncertainly. Joon paused as Sam held out a bunch of daisies. 'Aww, that proves Sam is sincere. It MUST be Ruthy's fault! ' Joon looked at Sam lovingly, taking the daisies with warm gratitude. She planted a small teasing kiss on those sweet lips of his. Sam grinned, and sighed with relief 'whew, maybe I'll have a chance after all... ' Sam beckoned Joon towards a nearby stone wall, leaning the picnic basket on top \"I made us all some sandwiches and stuff, so we can have a picnic. And I can explain everything!\" Ruthy stepped forward \"Hi Joon, are you all right?\" she asked in a concerned voice. Joon just stared. \"Boy, ah . . . you could really cut through this tension with knife, huh\" Sam said with a small laugh. Joon set the flowers on the wall, and removed her jacket. Sam and Ruthy watched in wonderment as Joon began to crack her knuckles. \"Ah, Joon?\" Ruthy started. Joon narrowed her eyes at Ruthy \"This is all your fault bitch! You have Benny, what do you need Sam for?!\" Sam and Ruthy exchanged confused looks. \"Look Joon, I don't know what you think is going on, but I can assure you that -\" \"I don't want YOU to assure me anything! Lets just settle this!\" Joon rubbed her hands together in anticipation. Sam's eyes widened, 'what's going on? This wasn't going to escalate into some gargantuan fight - two immortals locked in an epic battle until Judgment Day and trumpets sound? . . . Well, probably not, but it could lead to a saucy little cat fight like in \"Kill Bill\"! All this over little old me?' Flattered, Sam grinned to himself, but quickly shook his head and leapt between the two women, holding is hands up. \"Honestly, all this is just a HUGE misunderstanding, why don't we all sit down and have honey and asparagus sandwiches and talk this over -\" Sam reasoned - uneventfully. \"Cool it Sugarbutt.\" Joon replied coolly. Ruthy, realising Joon had finally snapped like a twig, rolled up her sleeves and cracked her neck. Worried, Sam backed away as the two faced off \"Bring it ON BITCH!!\" Joon shouted. \"Let's play\" Ruthy replied with a sly grin . . . * * * Hehehe, I'm evil! Yeah, you actually thought I was going to write something substantial? Nope, I'm stretchin' this for ALL it's worth! Nah I think It would have been too long otherwise - and yes i know its OK, did everyone pick up the not-so subtle POTC, Once Upon A Time In Mexico and Desperado references? Thought so. You all know what to do *points at review button*. Thanks again readers![Chapter 14] Howdy doody everyone! Hehehe I can't believe I'm still writing this, it was only meant to be 7 chapters - one chapter for each day in my story. Oh well. It's too fun to write! Thanks so much to everyone who read/reviewed my story so far! - (keep on doin' it - I DARE ya!) Hey cool - there's now some kind of edit thing before you post, I can FINALLY use italics!! Yay! (sorry - random) OK, here it is - . . . Sam, knowing he was totally powerless to stop the only two women in his life from tearing each other apart, sighed and sat on the cold stone wall and pulled out a sandwich. Sam watched anxiously, munching thoughtfully on the sandwich, as Ruthy and Joon moved around in slow, deliberate circles, not daring to break eye contact. \"So, what are you waiting for?\" Ruthy asked arching an eyebrow at Joon. \"Are you sure this is the way it has to be done? You know, a SANE person would want to hear the explanation before resorting to violence\" Ruthy drawled. \"Well, I always was a - shoot first, ask questions later kind of gal\" Joon sneered back. Sam couldn't bear to watch. He tossed the half eaten sandwich on the ground, and covered his eyes. ' Ahhh, what am I going to do?!' Sam pondered desperately 'I can't let anything happen to Joon, OR Ruthy!' Sam sneaked a peek though his fingers and saw they were still circling, sneering at each other. \"You know something? I can't stand this! We are NOT enemies Joon. We're FRIENDS! F-R-I-E-N-D-S! Why are we DOING this?!\" Ruthy demanded. Joon paused. \"Friends? Before, you mentioned explanations. How do you explain YOU kissing, and embracing Sam?\" Joon demanded. Ruthy stammered something-or-other trying to find an explanation on the spot .\"It's not what you think -\" she replied weakly before Joon cut her off \"It's not what I think, ay?\" Joon repeated bitterly, tears forming in her eyes \"Well, I know what I saw, you two-timing BITCH!!!\" Without warning, Joon leapt at Ruthy, hands (and nails) outstretched. Ruthy fell backwards, the wind knocked out of her, as Joon tackled her to the ground. Ruthy could see red flames of jealousy and rage at the back of Joon's usually docile eyes. Sam watched in horror as the two scratched, slapped and rolled around on the grass; wincing especially as Joon tore at Ruthy's hair. \"Ahhh\" Ruthy screeched in pain, responding by flicking Joon's bra strap. \"Ouch! No fair!\" A small gathering of park-goers congregated around in a circle. A few younger ones rooted and shouted for whom they wanted to win. Sam started to get up, but realized that if he jumped in the rampaging fight (which was a pretty stupid sounding plan to begin with) he would no doubt get beaten up quite badly, and not really accomplish anything anyway. Plus, he had forgotten the band aids. Sam paused, then quickly sat back down and started biting his nails tensely. Egged on from the surrounding crowd, Joon felt energized, ready to kill Bill . . .er, beat the crap out of Ruthy . . . \"Want to play dirty, do ya? Well, here you go!\" Ruthy shrieked as she was pinned face down in the mud. \"Mmmime mmmona mmmet mmmmou!!!\" Ruthy spat. Joon paused to let Ruthy pull her face out of the mud. \"What?\" Joon inquired \"I couldn't quite hear you there, dearie!\" Joon replied sardonically. Ruthy simply roared, tackling Joon to the ground. Together they continued to bite, scratch, and slap as they rolled back and forth in the muddy patch of ground. ' This would be pretty damn hot, if they weren't trying to kill each other and all' Sam couldn't help thinking. What was he thinking?! These weren't Sam thoughts... 'Someone's spiked the asparagus!!! Must be . . . Or maybe they're a little off -' Sam's eyes rolled to the back of his head as he toppled off the wall onto the ground with a thud. The fight paused. \"SAM!\" the pair cried out in unison. Immediately forgetting the massive cat fight - which had been raging a good 10 minutes, they both rushed over to Sam's aid. Joon kneeled down and placed Sam's head on her muddy lap \"Sam, sweetie, it's all right. We're not fighting anymore. Are you all right?\" Joon cried. Ruthy crouched down in front of Sam and eased open his eyes - examining his pupils, then felt his wrist for his pulse, leaning in close. \"Hmmm, I'd say a slight case of asparagus goneoffiss. As well as severe stress. Wonder what could have caused that?\" Joon shook her head \"I told him not to eat that stuff! It went out of date 2 years ago. I've been meaning to clean the fridge out . . .\" Joon blushed, smiling sheepishly. Ruthy got up and went to the picnic basket, pulling out a bottle of water. \"Here, give him some of this\" Ruthy instructed, handing Joon the bottle. Joon carefully opened the water, cautious not to spill any . . . that is, before she decided to pour the entire bottle over his head. Sam awoke with a splutter, eyes blinking rapidly \"What the?\" Sam groaned softly as he sat up, gingerly rubbing his head. \"What happened? Is it over?\" He asked in a small voice. Joon and Ruthy looked at each other, and smiled. \"Yeah, I think it is.\" Ruthy replied, as Joon gave Sam her hand. Once he was standing, Sam shook his head like a wet dog, immediately splattering Joon and Ruthy with excess water. While Sam was fussing over the picnic basket, Joon crept over to Ruthy, whispering in her ear \"I will find out what's been going on\". Joon was slightly put off when Ruthy turned to her, smiling - not a mocking smile, but a genuine one \"Yes . . . you will.\" Hmmm I'm going to really miss writing this story when its done! Ah Benny and Joon - such a great film! *sigh* Hey, how did every like my asparagus gone-off-iss illness? Oh well, this is my universe, I can invent new ailments . . .right? \"What the?\" - my salute to Rove: Live. That show is tooo funny!!! I wouldn't expect many of you to read my other (sorry attempt of a) story. But I set a Johnny Depp in drag poll, and was curious to know people's opinions. You don't have to read the story, but maybe you could just check out the top of chapter 2. Ta![Chapter 15] Howdy everyone! Disclaimer: same old thing as last time. (oh, if (for some reason) anyone here reads my Secret Window story - don't expect any updates soon, I don't actually have a plot yet. Oops!) Sorry its taken a while, but you know - school, homework, watching television . . . Ooooh, there have been so many cool films coming out lately - Troy, The Day After Tomorrow (Jake Gyllehaal - me-ow!) Van Helsing (Dracula, Hugh . . .sigh Aussie Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi!!!) (lol) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban comes out in less than two weeks!! Yay!!! Thanks all who have been kind enough to read/review my story! A big plate of Jack cookies go to my great friend Lady Aragorn who has finally updated her wonderful Harry Potter story - after what seemed to be 2 million years! OK, on with the show . . . Well, after the incident in the park, things seemed to go back to normal. Joon was still suspicious of course, but decided to let things go . . . for now. But still, something had been nagging her from the back of her mind. What exactly had Ruthy meant when she said 'Yes . . . you will.' . . . Joon shook her head, she had plenty of other things to do than worry about that! Plus, she had to take care of Sam, who hadn't been feeling well. \"Do you want to watch \"Gone With The Wind\" now?\" Joon asked sympathetically while handing Sam a steaming bowl of chicken, orange and paprika soup. Sam nodded shyly as he picked up the soup spoon, smiling weakly. \"Thanks Joon\" he replied graciously, if somewhat worriedly at the additions to his chicken soup. Joon crouched down in front of him, feeling his forehead. \"Aw, my poor Sam\" Joon sighed, shaking her head. Sam still, of course, felt incredibly guilty over everything that he had put Joon through over the past two weeks. He had not even given her a simple explanation. He didn't deserve her sympathy, her love . . . or the scary tasting soup. Before he could feel any more sorry for himself, Scarlet O'Hara appeared on screen. Ah . . . Joon couldn't concentrate on the film. Not just because Sam kept quoting along during the WHOLE movie, but because she continually asked herself 'what had Ruthy meant'?! 'You know' the voice in her head began 'there are ways of finding out - ' \"No, I'm through with the snooping! I'm not freaking Sherlock Holmes you know \" Joon snapped at the voice in her head. 'You don't say' the voice sniggered 'you certainly caused a fine scene last time.' Joon paused. For once, the voice was right. Joon began to inwardly blush. She didn't know what had come over herself. She didn't fight people. Sure, she liked to burn things, and argue. Especially argue - but physically fight? \"After all, tomorrow is another day\" Sam cried dramatically along with Vivian Leigh. Joon turned to Sam, who had a big goofy grin on his face. \"You know, I think this is one of my all time favourite movies . . .\" Sam paused, \"Uh, actually, I'd better just say its one of my favourite films from the 1930's.\" Sam frowned for a second, then grinned once again, nodding in satisfaction. Although Sam had been quoting along with the film, the blank expression on Joon's face hadn't escaped him completely. He knew something was up. He also knew, he was probably the cause of it. That night, Sam awoke to hear Joon sobbing softly in her sleep. \"Sam\" she whispered, before beginning to weep in her sleep. What was she dreaming about? Whatever it is, it had something to do with him. And it wasn't good. At around midnight, Sam slid out of bed and softly padded towards the window. He carefully sat on the sill cross-legged and gazed out at the moon. The light through the window illuminated the handsome features of Sam's face, his unkempt hair appeared to glow from the dazzling moonlight. 'Boy, the moon is sure bright tonight. Hmmm, I wonder if it IS made out of cheese ?' Sam pondered in silent wonderment. For the next hour or two, Sam simply sat there, staring out at that big, bright moon. 'What would it have been like for Joon, if we had never met? Would she have been happier ?' Sam couldn't help thinking. He knew he had put her through a lot, but there was just cause. But that didn't always matter. Sometimes, you unintentionally hurt the ones you love. Sam pondered profound thoughts for a long time, weighing up the pros and cons. Finally, Sam turned and gazed adoringly at the love of his life. She deserved better. Much better. Blinking away the tears, Sam knew what he had to do. Joon stretched her arms sleepily. What a horrid nightmare. She had dreamt of the night her parents died, and then followed that nightmare with one where her sweet Sam had left her. How ridiculous. Eyes still closed, a smile upon her lips, Joon rolled over to put an arm around Sam. The smile faded. Her eyes flicked open. \"Sam?\" she cried out softly. No reply. She bolted upright. \"Sam?\" she called out, louder this time. Joon dashed down the stairs, searching all the rooms. Desperation was beginning to set in. She ran back upstairs to their room, flinging the doors to the wardrobe open. A scream erupted from her lips. Sam's things were gone. Shirts, trousers, his hat and cane. All gone! Joon rubbed her temples, head shaking, rocking back and forth. This can't be happening, this can't be happening. 'Finally sent him packin' huh?' The voice inquired cruelly 'Can't say I'm surprised, only . . . that he didn't leave sooner! ' Joon struck a thought, throwing on her dressing gown, as she ran towards Ruthy's apartment. Ruthy, who could hear Joon racing down the stairs, opened her door before Joon had a chance to knock. \"Is-he-here?\" Joon asked rapidly, poking her head through the doorway. Ruthy placed a sympathetic hand on Joon's shoulder. \"I told him not to go, pleaded with him. But he thought it was for the best. He wouldn't listen\" Joon simply stared at Ruthy with red rimed eyes. \"What?\" she whispered. Ruthy pulled an envelope from her pocket, handing it to Joon. \"He told me to give you this\". Joon took the envelope tightly, thanked Ruthy and walked slowly back to the apartment. Once inside, she sat down at the table and opened the envelope. A letter, which read: Deerest Joon, i m so sorry fore wat I have put you thru. I never ment to hurt you. I am catching the next train home, I think its fore the best. You deserv so much beter than me. I will love you always Sam. Joon stared at the letter in disbelief. He was really gone. Of all the days to leave . . . Joon checked her watch - no time to lose! She raced upstairs, threw on a summer dress and dashed out the door in the direction of the train station. She only hoped it wasn't too late! Was that a cliff hanger? I'm not quite sure. Hope it was. Thanks again everyone for reading my story - you guys are fantabulous![Chapter 16] Disclaimer - All I own is the dodgy plot - unfortunately, I don't own Sam. But I certainly wouldn't mind getting him for my upcoming birthday wink- wink . . . Sigh Well, hi everyone! Sorry, I've been pretty slack with the updating - but well, I seem to get a LOT of homework. Today I just saw \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" for the 2nd time - it is SOOOOO BLOODY BRILLIANT!!! It's EVEN BETTER the 2d time - Aww, so splendiferous! Harry friends, Professor Lupin and Sirius Black are just wonderfully great! double sigh. Sorry for the gushing, I get a little caught up sometimes . . . OK, ALL the time. Here it is - the 2nd last chapter . . . Joon ran. She ran until her veins pumped battery acid. She checked her watch as she ran, I'm pretty sure that the train won't be there just yet . . . Joon didn't want to even consider the possibility that her beloved Sam could already be aboard that train. The journey to the train station was like a giant obstacle course - fruit stand here, car there, circus elephants everywhere! But finally - she was there. The station was unnaturally quiet - well, besides the Fred Astaire music playing softly from the loudspeakers (to keep pesky teenage hooligans away). Only the lone ticket seller in his navy uniform could be seen. Phew , no train in sight. Hmmm, is that a good thing? Not even pausing to catch her breath, Joon began to look around the seemingly deserted train station. Joon stopped suddenly, spotting Sam. Joon's breath caught in her throat. It was as if she was seeing Sam for the first time. Unmistakably handsome and whimsical in appearance and nature. Joon was about to dash towards her sweet Sam, but paused to consider well, he did leave. Why would he want to come back - back to a poor crazy girl like me? Instead, she ducked behind a vending machine to collect herself. Sam was sprawled on the lime green station bench, cane resting across his legs, his luggage bag propped against the faded brick wall. Sam had taken his sweet time getting to the train station. He was in no rush to leave Joon, the love of his life. But he did what was needed to be done. This was merely a single component in the grand scheme of things. Or so he thought. Sam was beginning to wonder if he was ever going to see Joon again, when he casually turned his head to catch a familiar glimpse of shimmering hair. Could it possibly be? Sam shook his head and looked again. Nope, its gone . Sam's shoulders slumped. He shoved his hands deep in his pockets and sighed, withdrawing his faithful old pocket watch, flipping it open. Hmmm, things aren't looking so good . Gingerly, he clicked it shut and placed it back in is pocket and stood up. Sam was in a pacing mood. He stuck his cane upright between the grooves of the bench, and for the next 5 minutes, paced back and forth, and back . . .and forth, until Joon finally emerged from behind the machine. So this was it then, the grand showdown - or bittersweet reunion between two oddities in love. Sam stopped dead in his tracks as Joon shuffled timidly from behind the machine. The pair were separated by several metres. For a moment, they just stood there. Joon took several small steps forward and stopped. Sam felt the strangest sensation inside his stomach, not just the usual butterflies, but full-on humming birds - ready to flutter Sam right on up to that cheesy old moon in the sky. Sam's eyes had immediately lighted up at the first sight of Joon. He moved several paces forward and also stopped. Joon's eyes began to gloss over, with the hint of tears threatening to erupt at any second, again advanced a further few steps - the gap between them slowly closing. Sam's lips began to spread into a slight smile. Sam, taking a deep breath, paced determinedly towards Joon until they were only inches apart. Without breaking eye contact, Sam whipped off his hat and tossed it at the bench, landing neatly on his cane like a hat rack. Joon looked away and gazed down at the ground, not quite sure what to say. Sam gently placed his hand on Joon's face, lightly caressing her cheek, wiping the tears away. Carefully, he cradled Joon's chin, tilting her head upward. Joon gazed into Sam's eyes, a sad smile on her lips. \"I, I thought I lost you.\" Joon managed to whisper. A pang of guilt hit Sam like icy water. He smoothed back a wisp of unkempt hair from her face. \"It's all right. No more secrets\" he whispered softly in her ear. Joon's tears now flowed freely as she threw her arms around Sam in a tender embrace, she never wanted to let go. As Fred Astaire's rendition of George Gershwin's \"You Can't Take That Away From Me\" came over the loudspeaker, Sam took a step back and held out a hand \"would you care to dance?\" he asked playfully. \"I, I don't really know how\" Joon replied blushing. Sam smiled back confidently, \"Well, I'll just have to teach you then.\" Joon smiled shyly and took his hand. Sam held one hand, and gently placed the other around Joon's waist, leading her in a slow waltz. Sam gently stroked Joon's hair as she lent her head upon his shoulder. After a moment, Joon lifted her head, whispering \"If I've done anything to make you -\", Sam placed a finger to her lips to silence her. \"Shh\". Lowering his head, Sam closed his eyes and captured Joon's mouth in a sweet and passionate kiss. Steam formed from the ancient train as it rolled languidly into the station, creating a perfect golden Hollywood moment - Casablanca style - two lovers in a tender embrace at a fog shrouded train station. Only, Sam was a little too occupied to notice. Their intimate moment was broken by the shrill train whistle. Gazing into his face with glimmering eyes, Joon stepped back and so did he. Broad smiles on both their faces. Joon sniffed slightly. Sam gentlemanly handed Joon a handkerchief - as well as one for himself. Blowing his nose noisily, Joon burst into soft laughter. \"Let's go home\" she said, holding out an outstretched hand. He went back to the bench, retrieving his hat and cane, then strolled over to the wall to collect his suitcase. Grinning, he tipped his head to the side, once more kissing Joon's check before leaving the station hand-in-hand. Sigh If I ever found a guy like Sam, I would be the luckiest girl on earth. I wonder if fella really exists? Thanks again everyone![Chapter 17] Disclaimer - same as last time folks! Howdy everybody! Hey - Johnny won an Mtv award! Jack cookies and (legal) martinis all around - mit me kids - I've finally turned 18! Woo hoo! - And I got my learner's license - took me long enough - am I right L.A? I've seen - King Arthur - which was really cool - I'm a big Ioan Gruffudd fan - and FINALLY got to see him on the BIG screen! Shrek 2 and Spiderman 2 were also brilliant - character development - nice. Well, we're finally here - the last chapter. I've had heaps of fun writing this - and I sincerely hope you've liked it (even if only a little). The pair strolled home in perfect, comfortable silence, only occasionally stopping to gaze adoringly at each other. Just a short distance from their apartment, Sam halted. \"What's the matter?\" Joon asked with concern. Sam pointed at a tiny pink and gray bundle of feathers in the gutter. Joon scratched her head \"Wonder what it is? - and don't say 'bird' - that much is obvious.\" Sam withdrew a large checked handkerchief from his pocket and wrapped it around the bird gently. He lifted the bird for closer inspection. \"Hey - its a galah! Wow, your a long way from home little fella!\"Joon quirked a suspicious brow \"how did you know that? And since when have you been a bird expert? . . . And how do you know where it's from?\" Joon inquired rapidly. Sam simply shrugged and replied matter-of-factly \"its from Australia - Discovery Channel\" Joon paused a second, then nodded. The bird hadn't been badly hurt - but was thoroughly shaken up. \"You're a cute little guy, aren't you?!\" Sam cooed affectionately. The bird replied by biting his finger. \"Ouch!\" Sam yelped, shaking his finger. \"Feisty too\" Joon added with a slight smile. Sam attempted to calm the bird down. \"Come on, I won't hurt you! Truce?\" The bird appeared to become docile as Sam and Joon stroked its head gently. \"We can keep him for a little while, can't we - even if its just till he gets better?\" Sam asked pleadingly with those puppy dog eyes of his. Joon paused for a second before nodding in agreement. \"Jolly good!\" Sam cried enthusiastically. As a short detour, the three of them headed towards a nearby bench to figure out a name for the little bird. \"OK. What should we call you? How about Rudolph...or Valentino?!\" Sam suggested hopefully. The bird gave a loud, annoyed squawk of disapproval. After a few well pondered minutes - Joon had it \"Well, if he's from Australia - why don't we name him after a famous Australian? Like Percy - Percy Grainger?\" Sam stared back blankly. \"You know the composer? There was a Richard Roxburgh film about him a few weeks back . . .\" A flashing light bulb went off in Sam's head \"Oh yeah, I remember. So, what do you think of that little guy?\" The bird bobbed its head in a sure-why-not gesture and croaked \"well that's just peachy mate\" and rested back down in the cozy handkerchief. \"Well what do you know! I think he likes it. Although its somewhat creepy that he understood what we said . . .\" *** The three finally started back home. When they reached the front door, a sinking feeling plagued Joon - she left in such a rush - she had forgotten to lock the door . . . and there was a small gap too . . . panic set in. Sam, clearly noticing the distress on her face smiled reassuringly \"I'm sure its nothing. Lets just go in, all right?\" Joon nodded and nudged the door open. Well, everything seemed to still be there, until... \" SURPRISE !!!\" the lights flickered on to reveal all her friends leaping from behind the furniture. Joon simply stood there - dumbfounded, as she was showered with rainbow coloured confetti. Ruthy came forward with a gargantuan multi-layered birthday cake, inscribed with 'happy birthday dearest Joon'. Joon wiped away a tear as Benny rushed forward ad handed Joon a large box with a purple ribbon. \"Happy birthday Joon.\" he grinned, kissing her on the cheek. Joon hugged and thanked her guests as they filed forward with gifts and congratulations. Sam, meanwhile, had gone and found an old shoe box for Percy and lined it with socks and material, and was feeding him bread. The party lasted the whole day, Ruthy and Benny were the last to leave, each hugging Joon one last time before departing. \"Gosh I missed you Juniper!\" Benny whispered, squeezing her \"it was mighty nice of Ruthy and Sam to organize all this, huh? They even organized for my plane and everything so I'd be here in time. Because I could never miss my favorite sister's birthday!\" Joon grinned \"Yes Benjamin, especially since I'm you're ONLY sister!\" Benny poked his tongue at her \"So, did anything interesting happen these past two weeks?\" Benny inquired, collecting his coat. Joon threw knowing glances at Ruthy, then to Sam \"nah, not really\". The three started to laugh. Benny, rather confused joined in just for the hell of it. \"Tell me how it goes!\" Ruthy whispered to Joon. Joon stared back blankly ' tell you how what goes ? she wondered silently - a question soon to be answered. Now, it was just Sam and Joon. Sam, stood shyly at the door. \"Sam - all this time - the \"thing\" with you and Ruthy - it was planning . . . this. Wasn't it?\" Sam nodded. Joon, flopped exhaustedly on the couch, beckoning him over. \"Deep down - I knew you and Ruthy weren't . . . you know. But . . . hey - wait! - What about that time I caught you sans trousers in her apartment? That looked pretty suss - you've got to admit.\" She arched an eyebrow as Sam blushed sheepishly \"I kinda spilt really hot coffee on my lap. REALLY hot' he added. Joon leaned back, satisfied. Sam pulled out his pocket watch, frowning slightly \"hmm, I think it's about time I gave you my present\". Sam, who had just a few moments put o his \"Wonka\" top hat, gingerly removed it from his head, showed her the contents - nil, then replaced it on his head. Next, he pulled out a cherry red kazoo from his pocket, played a few bars of the Harry Potter theme song, tapped the kazoo on his hat twice and knelt down by Joon's side - who had become increasingly interested in what on earth Sam was doing. Holding out his index finger for a moment of pause, he reached deeply into his top hat and handed Joon a flat parcel and a lilac envelope. Joon beamed with curious delight as she inquisitively tore open the sunflower yellow wrapping paper. A tiny gasp of delight left her lips, for inside was the most beautiful collage of photographs she had ever seen - all of her and Sam's best and memorable moments together. At the top of the exquisite frame was a small red heart, embossed with \" Sam loves Joon\". \"Oh I love it!\" Joon cried, throwing her arms around Sam. \"Don't forget the card\" Sam pointed out. Joon smiled back warmly as she opened the envelope. The card was handmade with swirls of purple and blue decorating the front, reminiscent of the first time Joon \"painted\" with Sam - just using their fingers, sensually sliding around the cool, oozing paint. The message inside was as sweet as expected (and with perfect spelling too! - no doubt with a little help from Ruthy): \"Dearest Joon, My love for you is greater than the oceans and the sea, I find that when I'm with you, I'm the happiest I could be. With all the strife I've caused you, I'm surprised that you're still here, 'cause if I ever lost you - may I be trampled down by deer! So here's a simple birthday wish, with love from me to you, Buster gives his best regards, and Fred and Ginger too! Happy birthday Joon! Love always Sam XXOO\" Joon had never read anything so sweet and perfect in all her life. Joon couldn't believe what a moron she was to ever have doubted Sam, that he would ever do anything to hurt her. Just as Joon was about to kiss Sam, she noticed there was still something in the envelope. \"What's this?\" Joon thought out loud, holding the envelope upside down. Two strips of cardboard tumbled out. Joon slowly picked them up and examined them closely . . . and screamed. In the meantime, Sam had been nervously biting his nails and had almost bitten off his finger when Joon screamed. \"No way!\" Joon shook her head in disbelief, \"are these, - they're real - aren't they?\" Sam nodded. \"But . . . how?!\" Joon demanded, attempting to contain her excitement. \"You know -its funny, I've never won anything - before now. I think you must be my lucky charm! - now you know why I was watching that doco! I know you've never had the opportunity to do something like this before, so I -\" Joon cut Sam off with a long and passionate kiss. \"Thank you\" she whispered \"this is the most marvelous surprise ever!\" Sam blushed, but managed to say \"well, I guess we better get packin' - we're off to sunny Australia - the land down under!\" Well, that's it everyone - thanks so much for your time, and all the kind reviews! Farewell fellow fanfictioners, until next time . . . ","Summary":" * I wrote this story back in 2003/4, (its now 2010) and I've only just revisisted it after all thes"},{"Movie":"Benny and Joon","Title":"Sam and Joon Get Their License","Author":"NatalieEvans1985","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4903259","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I got bored working on my other story so I started this one. I got this great idea as I was working on my other story. My boyfriend wants to get his driver's license too but he doesn't have a car and I'm too paranoid to let him drive it. My dad said he can give him his old Honda, that be cool. It had been a year since Sam and Joon had been living on their own. Everyone they knew had a driver's license and a car. They both had to take buses to get to places. Sam had to take a bus to work and back and when he needed to get things. Whenever Joon needed more paint or other art supplies, she would call Sam or Benny. Sometimes Ruthie got her things too she needed just to spare Benny and Sam. \"I wish I could drive,\" said Joon. \"Why?\" Sam asked. \"Don't you get tired of waiting for the bus and sometimes it never comes or it breaks down and if we had a car, it be a lot quick to get to places and back and you wouldn't have to worry about carrying all that art supplies on the bus for me,\" said Joon. \"But cars are expensive,\" said Sam. \"How are we going to get a car?\" \"I'll call Benny and tell him I want to get my license and I want a car.\" Joon picked up the phone and called Benny. Benny was in the kitchen cooking when his phone rang. He went and answered the phone and took it with him to the kitchen. He had a long extension phone cord. \"Hello?\" \"Benny?\" Joon said. \"Hey Joon what's up?\" \"I want to get my driver's license and I want a car.\" \"Joon, driving is a big responsibility,\" said Benny. \"When you are behind the wheel, you are held responsible for accidents when you are at fault and cars are expensive to maintain and don't forget about the gas and the oil change, the tune up, needing new tires, and new windshield wipers.\" \"You can fix it when it needs it,\" Joon pointed out. \"I will charge you.\" \"Ruthie told me you didn't charge her for the labor when you fixed her car,\" Joon pointed out. \"That was different. That was my apology for turning her down for a relationship,\" Benny said. After Joon had moved into her own apartment, Benny decided to try having a relationship with Ruthie. It lasted maybe six months and then it was over. Their interests were just different and they both wanted different things in their life so it made them incompatible but they stayed friends and in touch. She still went to the poker games. \"But I really want to be more independent. I don't like to keep having to call you or Sam or Ruthie to get me things,\" said Joon. \"Besides Sam has been having bad luck with the Spokane Transit Authority. He was late to work three times so far this month and late to get home one day because the bus broke down. First it was the steering wheel fluid spraying out, then it was the breaks that went out, and then the engine was over heating-\" \"Okay Joon, I will think about this okay and let you know,\" Benny interrupted. \"Okay thank you,\" said Joon. \"Okay see you soon, bye.\" He hung up and went back to his cooking. He really should think about rather Joon could drive or not. He only said that to get her off the phone. He wasn't up for arguments. \"No Benny you can't be over protective of her,\" Benny told himself. Then he started to have a conversation with himself in his head. \"But I don't want Joon to get in a car wreck and be held responsible. I don't want anything bad to happen to her. She's mentally ill.\" \"Benny will you relax, she isn't a child, she is an adult. She wants to be more independent.\" \"But what if she has one of her outbursts on the road and goes into road rage, she would also be held responsible for that. What if she starts hearing voices and starts screaming and takes her eyes off the road during one of her breakdowns?\" \"Benny will you stop being so paranoid, Claudia drives, Jennifer drives.\" \"But they aren't sick.\" Jennifer was an old friend of Ruthie's who had moved to Spokane last summer and Claudia was married to his friend Eric and pregnant with their first child. Claudia was deaf so she didn't speak and she only spoke in sign language or read lips. Jennifer had a undiagnosed condition so it made her function differently and view the world differentally than other people. Sam was different too. He was eccentric and had a reading disability. He probably had a undiagnosed condition too. Joon was happy Benny would think about it. She hoped Benny would let her and help her. She wanted to get her license and have a car so she have more freedom. \"So what did Benny say?\" Sam asked. \"He said he would think about it. I bet he will say yes and help me get a car and help me get my license. I will study for the test and ace it.\" \"Joon,\" said Sam. \"What?\" \"Maybe I should get my license too so I can drive. You wouldn't have to do all the driving.\" \"Okay. That be great,\" said Joon. About Sam having bad luck with the transportation system, that was actually based on a real experience with my boyfriend in 2007. The bus broke down one time, and then another power steering fluid was spraying out, the light rail caught on fire, and other buses broke down on him and it was all in the same year. I just thought it was funny because he was having bad luck with Trimet here in Portland. Boy would I be mad at my boyfriend for being late to getting to my aunt's and uncle's house to see me back when I was still living with them but once he told about his \"bus problem\" I got over it and forgave him. He had a valid reason to be late. It wasn't his fault and he didn't plan it. Can deaf people drive? I'm not sure. After all they can't hear so would the DMV still let them drive?[Chapter 2] Benny kept thinking about rather Joon should drive or not. He would ask all his friends about it. He went to work the next day and told Eric about what Joon had told him. \"Joon called me last night and told me she wants to be more independent,\" Benny said. \"So,\" said Eric. \"So she wants to get her driver's license and wants a car.\" \"That's cool.\" \"You really think so?\" Benny asked. \"Yeah sure. It give you more freedom, no more having to get art supplies for her or food, she could do it herself.\" \"But what if she does something inappropriate on the road? She's sick.\" \"You worry too much,\" said Eric. \"You let her live in her own apartment so why not let her drive?\" \"Because driving is a big responsibility and living on your own is less responsibility. Her home doesn't move.\" \"But she could light things on fire and burn the whole complex down and you aren't worried about that. She could still wander off and do disturbing things to the public and you aren't worried about that so why not let her drive?\" \"Okay,\" said Benny. \"I see your point. After work that day, Benny called Ruthie on his cell phone. He had gotten one not too long ago. Ruthie's friend had one so why not get one of his own. It made things more convenient than looking for a payphone. Ruthie still didn't have a cell phone so he had to call her apartment. She wasn't home yet so he headed back to his house. He called Jennifer to see if she thinks Joon should drive. \"Hello?\" she said. \"Jen,\" Benny said. \"Is this a good time to talk for a moment?\" He had to make sure he wasn't calling her at the wrong time. She hated unexpected phone calls and being kept from what she was doing. \"Sure,\" she said. \"Joon had called me last night telling me she wants to be more independent.\" \"Oh, how so?\" \"She wants to get her license.\" \"How can she want one? She doesn't even have a car,\" she said in astonishment. \"She wants a car too.\" \"How is she going to afford one? Have Sam buy one? His job is minimum wage, I doubt he can afford it.\" \"Just stick to the topic,\" Benny told her. \"I am on topic or I can start talking about elephants, now that be off topic,\" she said. \"Do you think I should let Joon drive?\" \"She can't afford a car I don't think,\" she said. \"But what if she could afford a car, do you think she should drive?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why you say that?\" \"Because I think she might be capable, she doesn't seem like she's incapable of doing it,\" she said. \"But she lights things on fire, she does disturbing things to the public. You don't think she have any outbursts on the road or do road rage when she gets mad or do disturbing things as she drives?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Do you still think she should drive?\" \"I don't know. Why not let her and have her make her own mistakes?\" \"She's sick,\" Benny pointed out. \"I don't want her to get in trouble if she does something wrong and what if she gets pulled over and has an outburst with the officer? What if she assaults him? She could have charges pressed against her. That be bad,\" and he shuttered. \"You let her live in her own apartment and were you worried about her doing disturbing things to the public then?\" \"You have a point,\" Benny said. \"Even Eric said the same thing. I appreciate your time so I will get going now. Bye.\" \"Bye,\" Jennifer said and she hung up. Benny put his phone back on the thing. He waited an hour before he called Ruthie again to see if she was home. She was. \"Hello?\" she said when she picked up. \"Hi Ruthie,\" Benny said. \"Joon called me last night.\" \"What did she say?\" Ruthie asked. \"She told me she wants to drive.\" \"Oh?\" \"Yeah and I'm not sure if I should let her or not. I mean she's sick and she is prone to having outbursts and what if she has them on the road? That could lead her to road rage. What if she gets pulled over and she gets upset she assaults the officer? I don't want her to get arrested and have it go on her criminal record.\" \"You worry too much,\" said Ruthie. \"I think she would do fine on the road. You let her live here so why not let her drive?\" \"Jen and Eric said the same thing,\" said Benny. \"You have a point.\" \"So you're calling everyone you know to see if we all think rather Joon should drive or not?\" Ruthie asked. \"Yeah,\" said Benny. \"But I'm leaving out Mike. I'll save him for when I want to brag.\" Mike was a jerk Eric and Thomas had as their poker buddy at their poker games they held at Eric's house. He was Sam's cousin and put him in the pot to get rid of him and tricked Jennifer into putting her son in the pot too by telling her it was perfectly safe and legal or was he really being nice by trying to help her? Who knew, he didn't seem to get you can't bet a human being after he put Sam in the pot. He also was mean to him, Joon, and Jennifer but he was just a jerk. He was pretty much mean to anyone. He had been mean to Ruthie too before and to Claudia. Jennifer just loved ripping on him and picking fights with him and it be a bully match between those two. One day they all watched them insult each other back and forth so it was like a insult match. They all sat and watched them. Ruthie didn't like it but her friend liked insulting him and she kept on doing it even after Ruthie has told her he isn't worth it. Now he hardly came to the games. He didn't want to be there when she be there and everyone likes it when she start insulting him and then her boyfriend takes her side. One time he got a punch in the stomach by him for saying something mean to her. It wasn't fair, how come she is \"stupid\" and gets to be better than him? She has a bigger apartment, a cell phone before them, and now is dating a rich guy. \"Okay,\" Ruthie chuckled. She thought it was funny when he said he would save Mike for when he wants to brag. \"You can brag to him about when Joon does get her lisence. Get her a car that is better than Mike's so you have something good to brag about.\" \"Okay,\" Benny said. After he hung up, he called Thomas. He should be home. He was because he had answered. \"Hello?\" \"Thomas,\" said Benny. \"I need to ask you something.\" \"Okay.\" \"Joon called me last night and told me she wants to be more independent. She wants to drive.\" \"Really?\" Thomas asked. \"Yes,\" said Benny. \"Do you think she should?\" \"She doesn't have a license,\" Thomas said. \"I know that but she wants to get one and she wants a car too.\" \"Oh.\" \"Do you think she can do it?\" \"Can she afford one in her budget?\" Thomas asked. \"I might help her out,\" Benny said. \"But I want your opinion if you think I should let her drive.\" \"Sure why not,\" said Thomas. \"She knows right from wrong so I think she be capable of understanding the rules of driving and know the consequences to her actions if she does them.\" \"But she has directed traffic a few times,\" Benny cried. \"So how will I know she won't do something disturbing on the road when she drives? What if someone upsets her on the road, she might go into road rage and what if she gets pulled over by the officer, she might have an outburst and hit him.\" \"Well she is an adult so it's her choice, let her decide, just make sure she is aware of the consequences for her actions if she does them,\" Thomas told him. \"Okay, thanks for your opinion and suggestion. Bye.\" \"Bye,\" said Thomas. They both hung up. Now Benny had to pick up the phone and call Joon to tell her the news. Okay I went into a little detail about the poker game and felt like doing some Mike bashing again. We all hate Mike. Ah poor Mikey, someone he thinks is stupid is better than him because she has things he doesn't have.[Chapter 3] Joon got a phone call from her brother. Sam rushed to the phone and answered it. \"Hello?\" \"Is Joon there?\" Benny asked. \"Joon, it's your brother,\" Sam said. Joon was sitting at the table eating her dinner. She got out of her seat and went to the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Joon, I talked to everyone and they all think you should be allowed to drive,\" Benny told her. \"Really?\" Joon said excitedly. \"That means I can get a car and get my license?\" \"Yes Joon but you do knowing driving is a big responsibility and you are held accountable for your actions on the road and when you get in a wreck, you are held responsible if you are at fault,\" Benny warned. \"Yes Benjamin I know,\" Joon said. \"I'm just making sure you understand. I will stop at the DMV and pick up a driver's Manuel for you to study. You need to study for the written test and when you pass it, then you need to pass the driver's test.\" \"Sam wants to get his lisence too,\" Joon said. \"He does? Okay I will pick up two Manuels then.\" \"How am I going to get a car?\" Joon asked. \"Well I was thinking I can go the junkyard and pick out a car and fix it up in my shop and replace all the parts that need to be replaced and it be your birthday present.\" Joon got very excited and started to jump up and down. \"Really?\" she shouted. \"Oh thank you Benjamin.\" \"I will make sure it looks nicer than Mike's, now we would both have something to brag about.\" \"I don't care about that guy,\" said Joon. \"I'm not in a competition with him for the best looking car.\" Even she didn't like him so she thought he was a waste of her time. Jennifer is just foolish for wasting her time arguing with him and shooting him down with her bullying and insults to him just because he did them to her. But she said she liked picking fights with jerks because it's fun. \"Okay,\" said Benny. \"Would you like to go to the junkyard then, you and Sam so you can pick out a car you want and I'll have it towed to my garage?\" \"Okay,\" said Joon. \"We'll do it this weekend but I might have to borrow money from the bank if I don't have enough so don't think a car will leave that junk yard that day.\" \"Okay,\" Joon said again. \"I'll see you two tomorrow when I drop off the manuals, bye.\" \"Bye,\" Joon said as she hung up. \"Benny said yes,\" she told Sam. \"That's great,\" said Sam. He gave her a hug and patted her back. \"Benny is going to drop off the driver manuals for us to study,\" Joon said. Sam froze. Reading. He hated reading, it was too hard. \"I'm going to have to read?\" Sam asked afraid. \"Yeah, you have to take a written test to get your license.\" Sam grew pale. \"It's okay,\" said Joon. \"I'll help you. I can read the questions to you and the answers and you pick one of them. I will read the manuel to you. We'll study together.\" \"Okay,\" Sam said. He was happy Joon was going to make it easier for him. She was such a sweetheart.[Chapter 4] Benny stopped by at the DMV office the next day on the way to work. He grabbed two driver's manuals and headed out to his car. He put them in the passenger seat and headed to work. - After work that day, Benny stopped at Ruthie's building and dropped off the driver manuals at Sam and Joon's. He knocked on the door and Joon answered it. Benny handed her the manuals. \"Here you go,\" he said. Joon hugged him. \"Thank you Benny,\" she said. She was so happy she was going to get her license. \"Let me know when you want to take the test,\" he said. \"Read the manual and study for it.\" \"I will Benjamin,\" she said. \"See ya, bye,\" said Benny. \"Bye,\" said Joon as she closed the door. She was too excited to even go back to her painting so she sat down on the couch and opened the manual and started to read. Sam should be home soon. Benny was over at Ruthie's apartment visiting her. he told her about how he decided Joon can get her license and told her about he was going to get a car out of the junk yard and fix it up for Joon and it be her birthday present. \"That's great,\" said Ruthie. \"I hope the state of Washington will let her drive,\" said Benny. \"Why wouldn't they?\" Ruthie asked. \"Because she's sick.\" \"So.\" \"So they might say she can't drive because of it.\" \"She isn' that sick.\" Joon's illness was mild but ever since she had been with Sam, she had been a lot calmer and functioned more normally ever since but she still had her episodes. Sam loved her too much to leave, plus they were going to get married. They had decided on a small wedding, maybe have it at Benny's house and then go to Fergusons where Ruthie works and celebrate, have their party there and they would have a huge regular cake. They would invite, Benny, Ruthie, Sam's boss, Eric and his wife and their upcoming child, Jennifer and her son. Sam and Joon enjoyed having her child around, she dumped him off eveytime she be with her boyfriend. Joon figured maybe it was a man and woman thing they wanted to do and they didn't want him there or maybe they're doing kinky stuff. What kind of parent always dumps her kid off somewhere when her boyfriend would come over or when she goes sees him? It was obvious they were doing something else than spending time alone together. Why couldn't she just move in with her boyfriend? She couldn't move because her lease wasn't up. At least she was happy. When she first moved to Spokane, she was a mess. She was uptight, stressed, suffered a nervous breakdown, and she wasn't a pleasant person. Then when she had a two week break from her kid, she calmed down and then Peter, her boyfriend, walked into her life and she was even happier. Peter was also different and had a undiagnosed condition. Maybe they should invite him too. After all he was Jennifer's boyfriend. Jason also really liked him. They were both best friends. He even got him a electronic drum set for Christmas. Jason loved to drum so he was always drumming his hands on the table or on buckets at Eric's house he had when his mother go there for the poker game. \"What is that racket?\" Mike asked one time. \"Drums,\" said Peter. \"It's sounds like noise to me, tell him to stop.\" \"It's not bothering me,\" said Jennifer. \"Me neither,\" said Joon. \"Is it bothering anyone?\" Peter asked. \"No,\" everyone said except Claudia and Mike. \"Well it's bothering me, tell him to stop,\" Mike cried. Jason was in the house drumming on the buckets Eric had given him to give him something to do. \"Why's it bothersome to you Mike?\" Eric said. \"It's just sticks hitting the buckets.\" \"And that's why it's annoying.\" \"So would it make a difference if he was banging on real drums?\" Benny asked. \"Yeah,\" said Mike. \"At least it be something.\" \"But how is banging on buckets any different?\" Ruthie asked. \"Drums are noise too.\" \"I'll show him,\" Mike said as he got up. He headed in the house. \"No you leave him alone,\" Peter said as he started to go after him but Jennifer grabbed him and told him to let Mike be. \"Why? He is going to stop Jason from playing,\" Peter pointed out. \"Just wait, you'll see,\" Jennifer told him. Then they all heard Jason yelling in the kitchen. \"Hey don't leave me alone,\" he yelled. \"Give me those,\" Mike shouted. Jason was still screaming and then it was silent. The drumming started again. But Mike never came out. Eric decided to go inside and see what was going on. Mike was standing beside the counter top holding himself down there. \"Got beamed by an eight year old huh?\" said Eric. \"Leave. Me. Alone,\" said Mike quietly still in agony. \"What did you do to him Jason?\" Eric asked. \"Nothing,\" he said as he kept drumming. \"Come on, you can tell me.\" \"I didn't do anything,\" Jason said again. \"Did he hit you down there?\" Eric asked Mike. Mike didn't say anything. He was too embarrassed. Eric headed back to the screen porch. \"Looks like your son got him good Jen,\" Eric told her. \"What did he do?\" Ruthie asked. \"I'm not sure but Mike was holding himself down there.\" Everyone got the hint and started laughing. Jennifer knew Jason had hit him down there. With his foot or with the sticks or with his fists. Jason hit when he got mad or got bothered by other people. Especially if people tried stopping him from doing his thing, especially favorite things. Jennifer didn't care about Mike so she figured Jason would put up a good fight with Mike when he tried stopping him but she wasn't expecting he get him down there. Then Mike came back out. \"I'm leaving,\" he said. \"And she's too lazy to do her job,\" Mike pointed to Jennifer. \"Ah you want her to punish poor wittle Jason for getting you down there?\" Peter teased. \"I'm too stupid to even know how to punish my child,\" said Jennifer. Eric, Benny, Ruthie, Sam, and Thomas all laughed. Joon caught the giggles too. Mike had called her stupid before so Jennifer used it as a comeback. Mike headed out to his car. - \"I hope you're right,\" Benny told Ruthie. \"I just won't tell them she is sick. Sam shouldn't tell them either he has a reading disability, they could also say he can't drive.\" \"Lot of dyslexics drive Benny,\" said Ruthie. \"But is theirs bad as Sam's? I mean he can barely read so reading road signs would be a challenge and what is he going to do? Pull over at every road sign so he could try and read it?\" \"I'm sure Joon will help him study,\" said Ruthie. \"But how is he going to take the test? They're not going to let him take it home and do it.\" \"Joon will help.\" \"But are they going to let Joon read it to him and the questions and have him pick the answer? They might think he can't drive because of it because reading is required on the road.\" \"Unless you memorize the routes and what the signs mean like the speed limit limit signs, he can read numbers, and stop signs, interstate signs.\" \"But how is he going to go to new places? He is going to have to read maps and the street names and that is going to be hard for him.\" \"Joon will help,\" said Ruthie. \"You worry too much. I'm sure they will do fine. We'll play it by ear.\" \"Maybe I should hold off getting a car for Joon because I need to make sure she can get her license or Sam, one of them.\" \"That sounds like a good idea,\" said Ruthie. \"I hope Joon won't mind,\" said Benny. Sorry guys, I just had to do some Mike bashing again. I thought it be funny he get nailed by a kid. I wonder if I will ever run out of ideas how to torture Mike just like South Park people ran out of ideas how to kill Kenny.[Chapter 5] Sam came home late again. \"You're late,\" said Joon. She wasn't happy about it. \"We had a tire blow out on the bus,\" Sam explained. \"Really?\" Joon asked. \"This is the fifth time now this month.\" \"Yeah, and we were all stuck waiting for them to come with the new bus and I decided ah screw it I'm walking home so I walked the three miles. Now my feet are sore.\" Sam sat down. \"Will you take my shoes off and massage them?\" Joon took off his shoes and started to rub his feet. \"Ah that feels good,\" Sam sighed. Joon kept massaging them. \"Ah ah ah, mmm, ah,\" Sam said. What was going on with the Spokane Transit Authority? Was it all a coincidence or was someone tampering with the buses? The STA had some investigation to do. They had cameras on the bus so they had decided they would start watching the videos and look for any suspicious activity. They also decided they should install some cameras at the garages when they aren't running to catch anything suspicious. Or maybe the buses were just getting old and it was time to replace them. After all they had been driving them since the early seventies so it had a lot of mileage on it even though the STA was founded in 1980. So a meeting was scheduled to be held the following month for all STA staff. Spokaners were welcome to come too if they had any questions or concerns. It was even on the news about their bus problems. It was a shame Sam and Joon didn't watch the news because other buses had been having problems too besides the ones Sam had been on. The first bus problem Sam had ever experienced was when Joon had her breakdown back when she was living with Benny. She was running away with Sam and she started to hear voices, so she flipped out and had a breakdown and Sam had to tell the driver to stop the bus. But when he stopped, Joon wouldn't get off so the bus driver had to call the STA quarters and report a woman on the bus having a \"tantrum\" so they called the police and a ambulance was sent over and Joon was taken to the hospital. Benny had called Joon telling her he would like to hold off getting her a car until she gets her license. \"Benny, I will get my license,\" she said. \"I just want to make sure you do. I don't want to waste my money getting you one and then the state of Washington decides you're unable to drive.\" \"Why? Because I'm sick?\" Joon yelled. \"Yes,\" Benny said. Joon started to get upset. \"Joon, sweetie, even if I did get you one now, you still wouldn't be able to drive it so we'll mind as well wait,\" said Benny. Luckily Sam was home so he saw Joon was getting upset so he took the phone from her. \"Hello?\" he said. \"Sam,\" Benny said. \"I was just telling her I wanted to hold off getting her a car because I want to make sure she can get her license.\" \"I'm going to get mine too,\" Sam told him. \"I know but what if the state of Washington decides you can't drive either because you needed help with your test?\" \"I will get my license,\" said Sam. \"You don't really read when you're on the road. You just know the routes and that's it.\" \"But you need to read road signs to help you get to places and be able to read maps but I've known people who can't read maps or have troubles with them and they still had their licences. You need to be able to read detour signs,\" Benny said. \"Joon will help me,\" said Sam. \"But what if she isn't with you?\" \"I'm sure she would come with me to make sure I make it there safe and back.\" Then Benny heard Sam snap at the other end. \"Oh no,\" he said and Benny heard the phone drop. Benny heard something in the background and then Sam came back to the phone. \"Joon lit something on fire.\" \"Oh you better go then,\" Benny said. \"I don't want her to burn the whole place down.\" \"Bye,\" said Sam. \"Bye,\" said Benny and he hung up. Benny had to head on over there to make sure everything was okay. He headed out to his car. Joon had a candle lit and she had lit a piece of paper towel on fire. Sam knew to not bug her when she is upset. He remembered the lesson he had learn on the bus. Don't ever tell her to \"calm down\" or else it make it worse. They didn't work on Ruthie's friend either or on her son. It also made their outbursts worse or their meltdowns. Peter had told them he just ignores it unless she starts hurting herself or throwing things. He just holds her and waits till she is calmer. With the help from her therapist, she had given her some techniques to help her calm down so she doesn't carry on and recommended her some games she could play. Every time Sam had problems with Joon, he would call Benny and he would come over and help. If she was too out of control, he called her doctor and she would come and give her a shot to help calm her down and she be put to bed but luckily that didn't happen very often. Benny had finally came over. He knocked on their apartment door. Sam answered it and Benny came right inside. \"Is Joon alright?\" Benny asked. \"Not really,\" said Sam. Joon was sitting at the table rocking back and forth and looking down at the table. The candle was still lit. \"Has she lit anymore things on fire?\" Benny asked. \"No,\" said Sam. Joon hadn't but she did light more paper towels on fire and Sam had to keep putting them out. He didn't want the place to burn down. \"Joon, are you alright?\" Benny asked. Joon didn't answer. \"I know you're mad at me but I want to make sure the State of Washington will let you get your lisence. I don't want to get you a car and then I find out they won't let you drive,\" Benny said. \"I can drive when I get mine,\" said Sam. \"But what if they also say you can't either?\" Benny said to him. \"Then you can always sell the car,\" Sam suggested. A light bulb went off in Benny's head. Why didn't he think of that before? He can fix it up and sell it if the state decides they can't drive because of their mental conditions.[Chapter 6] Okay I was on imcdb and I discover Ruthie was not driving a Mustang, it was a 1970 Ford Maverick. My ex and my bf had told me it was a Mustang. I also learned Benny drove a 1970 El Camino, not a '78. If you ever plan on going to Spokane, don't count on seeing a bunch of old cars. It's only for this story because the movie had a bunch of old cars in it despite showing two modern vehicles up close. The police car and the ambulance. But I swear I have seen a few other modern cars in the background but I was never sure. Benny had taken Sam and Joon to the junkyard that Saturday. Jason was with them. They were babysitting him again that day while his mother was out doing her thing. Sam and Joon didn't mind having Jason whenever she want to be alone or go out with Peter. Sometimes she just leave him with them over night because she stay the night at Peter's. One time she left him with them during spring break and didn't come back till the day before school started again. Ruthie used to have problems with it but seeing Sam and Joon didn't mind, and the fact Jennifer had her own problems and being a single parent is a lot of work, they were both happy. Jason didn't mind being dumped at Sam and Joon's and when they said 'anytime' they meant it. Peter paid Sam and Joon for watching him so he was making more money instead of making it from his current job. It didn't matter who he paid because Sam and Joon both shared the same bank account. Benny, Sam and Joon were walking around looking at the old cars. There were hardly any from the nineties. Jason was running around looking at old cars being fascinated by them and feeling sorry for them. He had empathy for objects. He climbed on the cars and starting jumping on every single one of them. \"Jason, no get down from there,\" Benny said. \"You might hurt yourself.\" Jason didn't listen so Benny tried again. He had to be logical. \"You might fall and hurt yourself, maybe break your leg or arm,\" Benny said. \"Your mother might never want us to watch you again because we let you get hurt.\" Jason jumped off the car. He didn't want to not ever see Sam and Joon again. He climbed inside one of them and pretended he was driving. Sam and Joon kept looking. Then they saw a yellow slug bug from the late 1960's. \"Oh I like this one,\" said Joon. \"But I hate yellow, that was the color Ted Bundy drove and the same model. I don't want to own a same car a serial killer owned.\" \"I doubt it's the same car Joon,\" said Benny. \"But it looks like it and I don't want to drive the same color model he had. Can you paint it another color?\" \"Lets go look around more, maybe we'll find another bug,\" Benny said. So they looked around some more. \"Jason, come on,\" Sam called. \"We don't want you to get separated from us.\" Jason got out of the car and kept looking at the other cars. Lot of them were wrecked, had parts missing from them. Lot of them were even totaled. Sam tried finding old cars from the 1920's and 30's but there were none. Most of them were from the 1950's 60's and 70's. Some of them were even from the eighties. They maybe saw about five cars from the current decade. Most Spokaners used old cars anyway from the 80's and 70's. Their city was still using the 1970's flxible buses. Benny had a 1970 El Camino, Ruthie had a 1970 Ford Maverick, Jennifer had a 1984 Plymouth Horizen, Eric had a 1981 Toyota pick up, Claudia had a 1979 Mercedes Benz, Thomas had a 1977 Datsun, and Mike had a 1977 Lincoln Continental. They kept looking. The place was noisy because it was right next to the freeway that went through Spokane . It was the only freeway that ran through the city. Then Joon found a car she liked. \"Are you sure about this?\" Benny asked. \"Yes,\" said Joon. Benny looked at the 1987 Nissan Stanza. It was a four person car shaped like a station wagon. It was more of a small family car. \"It looks like I could fix it up,\" said Benny. The car was only smashed in the front and it had parts missing. \"I can replace the seats in it and all the parts,\" said Benny. \"It's going to be expensive but I won't charge you for the labor. It be your birthday present. I will take it to my garage and fix it up for you two.\" \"That car's ugly,\" said Jason. \"It will look nice when I fix it up,\" said Benny. \"Lets go to the front and tell the guy we found a car we like to buy.\" They went back to the building and they had the guy who was working there come out and looked at the car. He sold it to Benny for two hundred dollars. \"It was in a wreck last year and the family had it towed here and the insurance gave them a check for a new car,\" the guy told him as Benny was writing out the check. \"The damage cost more than the car was worth so they had it totaled.\" Not too many Spokaners had modern cars. For some reason they were devoted to their old cars and kept them fixed up. Even car dealers there sold used cars there from the 1970's and 1980's. So the tow truck was brought into the yard and they put the car on it and Benny told them where he wanted them to take it too. So it cost Benny extra and the Nissan was hauled to his shop. Now Benny had to order parts for it and find seats to put in the car and but new body parts for the car and auto paint. Benny, Jason, and Sam all left the junk yard and headed home. They all had to squeeze into his El Camino. Joon sat in the middle with her helmet on and Sam sat on the passenger side with Jason on his lap. Benny dropped them off at their apartment.[Chapter 7] Something wrong with the system again so for some reason it keeps putting some words together, especially after I correct them. When I hit save, words get stuck together again so expect some stuck together words. June had approached and school had gotten out for the summer. Sam had already had a birthday and Ruthie was nice to bake him a cake for his birthday. Jason had gotten him an old movie for his birthday, Joon had gotten him a new tennis racket so he could make mashed potatoes. Ruthie had gotten him an old movie poster from Boo Radleys. It was a new movie poster but it was a remake. Joon had saved something special for Sam for last. She had gotten him some children books for him to read, the ones that would be easy for him. They were no more than above the third grade reading level. Jason could read at the 5th grade level despite he had just finished third grade. Sam and Joon had been studying for the test. Joon would read the manual to Sam and she would answer questions in it that would be on the test. After she got through reading it, she went through the questions and answers with Sam and had him pick one of them. Joon was killing two birds with one stone. She was studying for the test herself while she was helping Sam study. Benny had hardly worked on the car. He did order new parts for it but he had been too busy working on other cars, so he worked on it in his spare time. He had to order 1987 parts for the car model and had to look in the book and find seats to buy for the car. Joon's birthday was coming up too at the end of the month so Benny doubt he would have her car done on time but she could wait. If she passed the written test, it wouldn't matter if she had to wait for her car to get done because she still wouldn't be able to drive if she did get her license. She would have no car to drive. Spokane Transport Authority had held a meeting at River Park Square. The chief spoke up. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said. \"It's wonderful you all could make it. The issues we have been having is our buses keep breaking down. Breaks going out, steering fluid spraying out, tire blow outs, engine over heating, oil leaks, doors jamming, so I think it's time we get new buses.\" People started to talk. Lot of them were disappointed. \"I know we are all devoted to our old buses but I'm afraid we have to upgrade unless he can find vintage buses and paint them our color. We need a proposal for new buses. If we can't find vintage ones to buy, we will have no choice but to buy current model ones.\" The majority there were disappointed they had to replace their buses. They were just getting too old to maintain and they kept breaking down so it was better to replace them than being late to work or having to wait longer for the bus. Reliable transportation was better than being late going somewhere. But why couldn't they just keep maintaining them just they they did to their old cars? * * * Joon had kept studying and decided she was ready to take the written test so she called Benny. \"Hello?\" he said at work when he answered the phone. \"I'm ready for my test,\" Joon said. \"The written test for your license?\" Benny asked. \"Yeah.\" \"Are you sure? Your car isn't even close to being done.\" \"You haven't been working on it?\" Joon asked. \"Joon, I'm a busy guy. I had to order parts for the car and I am busy working on other cars, I can't work on yours at work, I can only do it in my spare time. Plus I had to take it apart and toss out broken parts. I took off the front and the brace. I also had to order those. I still haven't found any seats yet for the car.\" \"I want to take the written test just to get it out of the way,\" said Joon. \"Even if you do pass it, you still wouldn't have a car to pass the driving test.\" \"I can't use yours?\" \"What would be the point? Even if you do pass, you still won't have a car,\" Benny pointed out. \"I still want to take the test.\" \"Okay fine, I will take you in or have Ruthie take you in to take the written test. They are closed on the weekends.\" \"Okay, when will that be?\" \"I don't know yet. I work so it's hard to take you to take the test because of my work hours. Maybe I'll have Jennifer take you. I would just call her and let her know ahead of time so she doesn't freak out.\" \"Doesn't she also work?\" Joon pointed out. \"Yes but she works in her car too so maybe she can take you there as she is working and she be killing two birds with one stone. Or you can take yourself there.\" \"I don't trust the buses. Sam has been having bad luck with them,\" Joon said. \"That's because they're hitting six foot under,\" Benny said. \"Vehicles start breaking down after getting so many mileage.\" \"You car is a 1970\" Joon pointed out, \"and it runs good.\" \"I don't know, it gets too expensive to keep replacing parts so it's cheaper for them to get new buses.\" \"I want to take the test, let me know when I am going to be taken there,\" Joon said again. \"Alright,\" said Benny. \"I will see what I can do. I call you later, bye.\" Jason wasn't over at her apartment. He was over at camp Faltskog Peter ran during the summer on his land. He was going to be there the whole summer so it was like Jennifer had a whole summer break from her boy. But him being gone all summer, she would miss him because it be more than a few weeks so she got to see him when she be over there visiting with Peter. Peter didn't charge Jennifer for having Jason at his camp. No kid there picked on him because they all knew his mother was dating Peter so they acted like he was a royal prince there. They didn't care about his quirks or rudeness or how weird he came off as. They didn't even care when he start talking about dinosaurs. After seeing Jurassic Park with Peter and his mother, he had gotten into dinosaurs and wanted to know more about them, so Jennifer took him to the library and checked out a few books on them and Jason read them and learned about them. He had moved on from Home Alone to Jurassic Park and dinosaurs. It was a relief for her to hear something new finally. Now she was stuck hearing about him talk about dinosaurs so that got old. Jason also had a mental condition except he was diagnosed. His mother shared his condition too but she never went for a diagnoses because it meant getting told what is wrong with her and what she does isn't \"normal.\" She didn't need to hear how much of a freak she is, she had already been told by her therapist what she has difficulty with other people can normally do. Peter didn't care about labels so he wasn't interested in knowing what is wrong with him and why he had always been weird. He knew his girlfriend was different and her son but he didn't care. At least they both didn't see him as weird. Other people had always thought he was weird until he started his career. He was a famous singer and musician. Lot of singers were weird so people thought it was his persona. Because Peter was busy with the camp, it was stressful for Jennifer because it felt like he had no time for her so she was left alone in his house. Peter had explained to her it was only for the summer and he is just busy is all. They would get time together that night and told her to not worry and kissed her. He even told her she could hang out with him as he is busy with the camp so that's what Jennifer did. Every week, kids would leave and new kids would come by and get dropped off by their parents or buses that came from Idaho or Montana or down from Canada and from other parts of Washington. One bus even came from Oregon from the Portland area. Jason even made a new friend. He met a girl who was obsessed with volcanoes and she was also quirky and was an outcast and barely had friends and she also got teased in school. She kept talking about Mt St Helens being erupted back in 1980 and talking about how the Hawaiian islands were formed. Kids got sick of her talking about volcanoes but didn't mind Jason talking about his obsession. The girl didn't understand why she was being treated different. Why was it okay for him but not her? She just didn't see how Jason was special because his mother was in a relationship with the guy who ran the camp. To her, he was just another kid, not some special one. So she ran away from camp one day and hid in the forest. The staff had to go looking for her. Jennifer looked for her too with Peter. Then she took off and went on her own adventure. She kept walking and then she heard some sniffling. She followed the sound and found the girl sitting on a log crying. \"Hi,\" Jennifer said. The girl didn't say anything. \"Are you Lindsay?\" Jennifer asked. \"Yes,\" she cried. \"Everyone is looking for you,\" Jennifer said. \"What's wrong?\" \"Every body hates me,\" she said. \"Why?\" Jennifer asked. \"I don't know. Everyone hates me for no reason. They all say I'm mean and weird,\" Lindsay cried. \"I got the same thing too from other kids when I was your age,\" said Jennifer. \"Kids also thought I was mean and weird. I had all these labels on me. Retarded, rude, strange, stupid, idiot, insane, all sorts of stuff. Do you have lot of friends at home?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Why not?\" \"Lot of kids hate me,\" she said again. \"Do you have any idea why?\" \"I'm different.\" \"Well you do need to come back to camp,\" Jennifer informed. \"I don't want to. Kids will tease me again.\" \"Is that why you left?\" \"Yes and they treat me different too. It's okay for this one boy to talk about dinosaurs but they are mean to me when I talk about volcanoes.\" \"Are volcanoes your special interest?\" Jennifer asked. \"Yes.\" \"Do you talk about them a lot?\" \"Yes.\" \"That's probably why. No one wants to hear us talk about the same thing over and over so we have to learn to not talk about them so often. I did the same thing when I was a kid. I would only talk about what I wanted to talk about and not want to talk about anything else other kids wanted to talk about.\" \"But this one boy talks about dinosaurs a lot and they are nice to him still.\" \"Oh you mean Jason,\" said Jennifer. \"He's my son so they are giving him special treatment just because I'm dating the owner of the camp.\" \"He's so lucky. I wish my dad were the owner of this camp,\" Lindsay cried. \"Well let me tell you something. When Jason came here last year, I wasn't dating Peter then so Jason did get teased here and picked on but Peter stayed with him all the time so other kids wouldn't pick on him and they left him alone.\" \"I wish he stay with me too then.\" \"Well I can,\" Jennifer offered. \"Really?\" \"Yeah,\" Jennifer nodded. \"You seem to be my long lost twin.\" \"I don't have a twin.\" \"It was a phrase. It means you are a lot like me from when I was a kid.\" Lindsay still didn't understand but she let Jennifer take her back to camp. When they got back, they had to wait till Peter and all the staff got back. She took him in Peter's house. Jennifer showed Lindsay a Disney movie, Dumbo. \"You like Dumbo?\" \"Yes,\" Lindsay said. \"It's my favorite,\" said Jennifer. \"You like Dumbo? But that's a kids movie.\" \"Disney's for everyone. I'm sure you have noticed in the Disney movies some minor violence and deaths, Bambi's mother died. The wicked queen died, there is smoking in them, child abuse, name calling, see it's for everyone.\" \"There's no child abuse in Disney,\" said Lindsay. \"There is in Snow White and Cinderella. Did you see how the stepmothers treated them?\" \"They're not children.\" \"They were abused as children and it continued when they became adults until they got rescued by their prince.\" \"I thought Snow White ran away?\" Jennifer put Dumbo in. \"She did but then the wicked stepmother tried to kill her when she found out she was still alive hiding at the seven dwarfs house and then she was a deep sleep until the prince came and kissed her.\" They both watched Dumbo until Peter came back inside to see if Jennifer was there. He found her on the couch with Lindsay. \"You found her,\" said Peter. \"Where was she?\" \"In the forest,\" Jennifer said. \"I'm happy you're okay Lindsay,\" Peter told her. \"Don't ever take off again. We were all worried.\" \"She told me kids were teasing her so she left,\" Jennifer said. \"Oh those punks,\" said Peter. \"Kids are cruel and vindictive. Should I be with her all the time?\" \"She said she was going to be,\" Lindsay pointed at Jennifer. \"But I'm going to have to leave soon,\" Jennifer said. \"I have to work but I will be here in the evenings and on the weekends unless I have an article to write.\" \"But you said you be with me,\" Lindsay cried. \"I did but I didn't say I would be with you all day long.\" So Jennifer stayed with Lindsay for the rest of the evening until she had to head back home. She would come back the next day and stay with Lindsay. They bonded together and became friends. They both seemed to be lot alike except Jennifer had learned to not talk about her obsessions so much. She didn't mind hearing about her volcanoes but she got to talk about her own special interests, elephants and her favorite movie Dumbo. Lindsay didn't really listen about her elephants but thought it was interesting Jennifer got to ride one when she was a kid and at the Spokane County Fair. \"I didn't know you can ride an elephant,\" Lindsay said. \"I thought you could only ride horses.\" \"You can ride elephants too,\" Jennifer said. \"Did you know some countries use them for capital punishment?\" \"What's capital punishment?\" \"It's when they put you to death. They have the elephant stomp on them when they put them to death.\" \"Why?\" \"I don't know, for breaking a law. You know what a law is right?\" \"The rules of our country?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I didn't know they kill you for breaking rules of our country.\" \"Here they only do that if you kill someone or do treason. We used to put people to death for rape but not anymore.\" \"What's rape?\" \"When you force someone to have sex with you or when you tie them up and have sex with them and they didn't want it.\" \"What's sex?\" \"It's a grown up thing. Ask your parents when you get home.\" \"They won't tell me,\" Lindsay said. \"Well I guess they think you're still too young but I can't tell you or else they might get mad at me if they found out I told you.\" Lindsay didn't even ask her \"why\" or keep trying to get her to answer. With Jason, that be hard because he never wanted to leave his questions unanswered so he would keep asking her \"why\" until he got it. He had to know everything. When that week ended, Jennifer was sad to see her go. Jason was sad too see his friend leave. They had both hung out together and were partners when they play with the instruments. Jennifer was happy to see Jason had made a new friend his own age even though she was only eight and he was nine. He had a birthday the month before and they all celebrated it at Dominicks in downtown. Ruthie, Benny, Peter, Sam, and Joon were all there with them. Jennifer saw Jason had started to cry. \"What's wrong?\" she asked him. \"I don't want my friend to leave,\" he cried. \"But she has to, her time is up here so it's time for her to head home.\" \"But I would never see her again.\" \"You can always write to her.\" Then Jason felt better. \"Really?\" \"Yeah.\" So Jennifer got a pad and pen and asked Lindsay if she would like to keep in touch with Jason by writing to him. \"Sure,\" she said. Jennifer asked her for her address. Lindsay gave it to her as she wrote it down. \"There Jason, now you won't lose her as a friend,\" Jennifer told him. \"I will keep it in my purse so we don't lose it.\" Lindsay went to the bus with her stuff that would take her back to Portland but she didn't live in Portland, she lived in Washington right across the river. Parents took their kids there where they got on the bus that took them to camp and now they were going to have to go there again to pick them up. Jennifer went back in Peter's house and grabbed a bunch of empty envelopes and wrote Lindsay's address on them and put stamps on each of one of them. She put them in the guest bedroom Jason slept in. It had pretty much became his room. It had all his clothes there and his stuff such as his video games, and his toys but most of it was building stuff. Jason hardly did pretend play but spent time lining up his cars and action figures and dinosaur figures she and Peter had gotten him. Some of them were Jurassic Park toys. She put the envelopes on the table.[Chapter 8] Ruthie took Sam and Joon to the DMV where they could take their written test. She dropped them off as she headed to work. Ruthie had to work night shift again to close the diner. Sam and Joon checked in at the counter and told the lady behind there they were there to take the written test. \"You need to provide three things for your proof of residence.,\" she said. \"You need to show your address such as bring something here from your mail, if you have an sort of ID, bring it here.\" Sam also took out his ID and showed it to the lady. She took it and read it. It had his name and address, and his picture. Joon also had her regular ID too. Benny had told her to not show them her medical alert card because they might say she can't drive because of it. But she still carried her medical alert card just in case. She reached into her pouch she wore around her waist and took out her ID and handed it to the lady. \"Okay, now I need some sort of other proof. Your mailing address.\" \"Our mailing address is on there,\" Joon pointed. \"I know but I have to go by the rules,\" the lady said. Joon got upset. Sam saw it and grabbed their IDs and took her outside so she wouldn't have an episode in there. Sam put his arm around her. \"Joon, it's okay,\" he said. \"We'll head home and look through our mail and see what we can find and we'll come back.\" They headed for the bus stop. \"No I don't want to ride on the bus,\" Joon cried. \"Joon, we have to,\" said Sam. \"It's too far to walk.\" \"But I don't trust the authority,\" she said. \"At least it give us a boost and if it does breakdown again, we wouldn't have to walk as far,\" Sam assured Joon. Joon grabbed at her hair. Sam walked her to the nearest bus stop. They waited ten minutes for the bus. When it came, Sam put a quarter in for Joon and showed the bus driver his bus pass and sat down. They rode home without having any bus problems but Joon was tensed all along worrying the bus was going to break down and the bus driver has to pull over and he says \"Ladies and gentleman, we are experiencing some technical difficulty so I just called the STA headquarters and they will come out here with another bus. Sorry for the delay again.\" Sam held onto Joon. Her body was stiff all along. Sam was hoping they make it home without her flipping. When they got home, they got off and walked to their apartment. \"You did it Joon,\" Sam said. Joon was able to calm down knowing they made it home safe without being stuck somewhere in the city. Good thing she didn't have a job. Her job was painting and selling them on her front porch in front of their apartment. There were people out there who liked buying abstract paintings and saying it was done by a mentally ill person. At least her illness came in handy. God had a reason to make some of his people sick and make some different without being sick. Or was there a god? Maybe there is but Joon wasn't religious, neither was Sam. They were agnostic, same as Benny and Ruthie. Jennifer was an atheist and told her son god was a bunch of made up tales and the bible was written by a group of people and people are silly to read it and let it guide their lives. It be like her reading a book on Dumbo and letting it guide her life. She did good ticking off religious people who dared stopping her in the streets trying to hand her a religious booklet and she say \"No such thing\" and enjoying hearing their attitude and wasn't always sure what it meant. She even pissed Mormons off when they knock on her apartment door and how dare they interrupt her over something dumb that doesn't exist and try and get them to join their church. So Benny and Ruthie started doing that technique too, but Sam was too sweet to do it. Joon would just slam the door in their face when they knock on her door and she say \"I am in the middle of my portrait, leave me alone\" and slam the door. But lot of people were rude to door to door sales people. Lot of them didn't like being bothered by Mormons or by door to door salesmen. Some wouldn't even answer their doors. With Sam, he would be very polite and be open to hearing what they have to say and say \"No thank you but thanks for sharing your time with me.\" Poor Sam he was easy to being pressured to buying things by sales people so Joon was always there to help. She would get mad and tell them he said no and are they deaf so leave, and don't ever come back and bug them again and she slam the door in their face. She just hated people taking advantage of him by using his sweetness to pressure him to buying. He even let his cousin Mike push him around and be mean to him. He never stood up for himself. After years of being bullied and getting abuse, he was used to it so he acted like he didn't care or mind. He didn't even fight back when Benny threw him out of his house when he told him he was in a relationship with Joon. Instead he just told him he was scared and he could see it and he knew why and that he used to look up to him and now he can't look at him at all. Joon got so fed up with sales men, she finally put \"No soliciting\" sign on their apartment door along with the other sign \"Joon's Portrait Studio. Bug me during the hours of 12-4 PM on Monday through Thursday.\" - Sam unlocked their door and they went looking through their mail. \"Good thing we hoard it,\" said Sam. Sam and Joon collected mail for the past year including junk mail. Sam was never sure if they might need them in the future so they kept them in a drawer in their room. Sam grabbed all the mail and put it in a bag and left. \"I don't want to go through this again,\" Joon said. \"Joon, we have to risk this again,\" Sam said. \"We don't have a ride or else we would have to do this another time.\" But Joon wanted to get her license now. Joon was shaking feeling nervous for the bus so Sam decided they would call Ruthie's friend to see where she is at and if she can give them a lift if she doesn't mind. So they headed back to their apartment since neither of them had a cell phone. He picked up the phone and took out Jennifer's number and dialed it. Joon walked around her apartment feeling anxious as Sam was on the phone talking. \"Oh okay, thanks anyway,\" Sam said. \"Have a nice day, bye,\" and he hung up. \"Is she going to take us?\" Joon asked. \"She's in Idaho,\" Sam said. \"So she will not drive back here just to get us and then drive all the way back.\" \"Why would she be in Idaho?\" Joon cried as she flapped her arms. \"Job,\" Sam said. \"Why can't journalists stay in the same spot?\" Joon said. \"I don't get it, how can she go to places without a problem but have problems with flexibility when she's off work?\" \"Maybe she knows ahead of time,\" Sam suggested. \"Call Benny,\" Joon ordered. \"I think he's working.\" \"It's an emergency,\" Joon yelled. \"Why?\" \"I need to get to the DMV for my test.\" \"That's not an emergency,\" Sam said. \"It can be done another day. We'll just bring our proof of residence next time.\" Joon rushed over to the phone and picked it up and dialed Benny's work. The phone rang at Benny's Car Clinic. Waldo went over to it and answered it. Hello?\" \"I need Benny please,\" Joon said. \"It's an emergency.\" \"Hey Benny, Joon's on the phone again, she says it's an emergency.\" Benny stopped what he was doing and went over to the phone. \"Hello?\" \"I need a ride to the DMV,\" Joon said. \"Joon, I'm in the middle of work, you're going to have to take the bus.\" \"I don't trust them.\" \"Well then I guess you're going to have to take it another time.\" \"No, I want to now.\" \"Joon your car isn't even ready yet so what difference would it make if you do pass? You would still have to do the driving part,\" \"I just want to get it out of the way,\" Joon said. \"Well I am not going to leave work and lose money just because you want to take your written test. It can wait.\" Joon started to get upset. \"Okay fine I'll take you. Just don't have an episode,\" Benny said. He hung up and told Eric to take over the place. \"What happened?\" he asked. \"Joon has an emergency,\" Benny said. Eric understood but knew it was no real emergency. He didn't understand why things were emergencies to Joon when they really weren't to the real world. Benny didn't understand either but did them anyway because she was his sister. Benny took off his work suit and headed to his El Camino and got in. He drove all the way to the South Hill to get Joon. He pulled in front of Ruthie's building and parked his car. He turned it off and got out and went inside. He knocked on the door. Sam answered it. Joon grabbed her driver's manual and the bag and rushed out to Benny's car. Sam went with. He wanted to be with Joon. They both got in the Camino with Benny. Joon sat in the center. She picked up her helmet and put it on. Benny always kept it in the car with him in case so he wouldn't have to go all the way home and get it before he had to get her from somewhere. Benny took them to the DMV and dropped them off. Joon asked Benny to stay in case they have to head back home again. Benny sighed. \"Please?\" Joon said. \"I don't want to take the bus again and risk being stranded.\" Benny now couldn't wait till he got her car done. He was going to work on it all he can in his spare time and not have any free time. He would spend it all with the car when he has the parts. \"Okay,\" said Benny. Joon smiled and headed inside the building. Sam went in too. Benny just waited outside. Sam and Joon waited in line again. When their turn came, they went to the counter. They showed their IDs again and Sam poured all the mail out of the bag. The lady picked up one of the letters and looked at it. \"Great, now grab a form for which license you're getting and fill it out and bring it back here.\" \"Thank you,\" said Sam. \"Grab a number too so you can take the written test,\" the lady said. Joon went over to the machine and grabbed two numbers and sat down. Sam sat down with her. \"Oh Benny,\" he said. \"Do we still need him here?\" \"He can leave now,\" Joon said. Sam got up and went outside and told Benny he could leave now. \"Wonderful,\" he said. Benny rolled his window back up and turned his car on and left. Sam sat back down inside next to Joon. She had two forms with two clipboards. Sam didn't panic because he knew Joon help her. She filled hers out putting in her information. She came to a part where it asked if she had any disabilities that would limit her driving. Joon put 'no' anyway. She didn't think her illness effect her driving. Joon filled out Sam's application putting down his first and last name, middle initial, their address, and answering questions. \"Would you like to be a Washingtonian donor?\" Joon asked. \"What?\" Sam asked. \"It's if you die, would you like to donate your organ to someone if they need a transplant.\" \"Sure,\" Sam said. Joon checked 'yes.' \"What's your social security number?\" Sam whispered it in her ear as she wrote it down. Then she came to the disability part again. Shall she say he has reading problems? Would it effect his driving? \"Do you think you can drive despite your reading problems?\" Joon asked. \"Yes,\" said Sam. \"I know my way to work and know my routes so I should be able to drive.\" Joon decided to check 'no.' Then they were done, all they had to do was wait for their number to be called so they could take their written test. But would they let her read the test to Sam and the multiple choice answers?[Chapter 9] I had a writer's block so this story got delayed. Sam and Joon's turn came. Joon had to ask if it was alright she read the test to Sam. \"Does he have a vision problem?\" the lady asked who was handing them the tests. \"No, he just had troubles reading so I was wondering it be alright I read the test to him and he can choose his own answers,\" Joon said. \"That be fine. But then he has to have someone else do it who isn't taking the test.\" \"I can wait another time then,\" said Sam. \"You go ahead and take yours Joon.\" He knew how important it was to her for her take the test so he decided it was better he waits so she could take the test. Joon went in the room and sat down at a booth with her test and pencil. She started to read. Sam stood outside the room and waited. He waited for about a half hour before Joon came back out with the test. She went over to the counter and handed it to the guy behind there. He told her to take a seat and they will check the answers and get back to her. Joon sat down and waited anxiously. Sam sat down next to her. Soon her name was called. Joon got up. \"Did I pass?\" she asked excitedly. \"Afraid not,\" he said. \"You got eight wrong. You needed four to pass.\" \"When can she take it again?\" Sam asked before Joon said anything. \"Four hours but there be no time so she can come back tomorrow and take it again,\" he said. \"Okay, thanks. Okay Joon we'll come back tomorrow and try again.\" \"I don't want to take the bus again,\" she said. \"We'll try and get a ride again,\" he said. Sam paid for the written test and they both left. They had to wait for the bus again. Joon felt nervous all over. Sam put his arm around her and told her everything would be alright. They waited but the bus never came. Joon started to get upset. She was probably heading for a breakdown. Sam wondered what time it was. Maybe there was bus problems again and they would come with a new bus and continue the route. But there were other buses on the same route so they would catch that next bus. Joon was crying and pacing around flapping her arms and and hands. Sam was embarrassed by the scene. They were out in public but luckily no one has stopped and said a thing about her. \"We're stranded,\" she kept saying. \"We're not stranded,\" Sam kept saying. \"We'll get home.\" \"Nooooo we're stuck here,\" Joon cried. Sam decided he better find a payphone and call Benny's work. \"Joon, you want to go find a payphone and call Benny?\" Sam asked. But Joon was too upset to do anything. Luckily he had Benny's work number so he knew to call him but he was afraid of leaving Joon alone. He tried to get her to come along but she wouldn't let him take her anywhere. She kept carrying on. Maybe he needed to call the ambulance and take her to the hospital again. He could remember the time she had a breakdown on the bus when she was running away with him. He told the driver to stop the bus and when he did, Joon wouldn't get off. She stayed on and carried on. Maybe this would be the last time they try taking a written test without a ride. Sam let Joon carry on. He didn't know what to do. Maybe he should get a cell phone so he could use it for emergincies. But how much did they cost? Then a lady who was walking by asked Joon if she was okay. \"She's mentally ill,\" Sam said. \"Will she be okay or do I need to call for help?\" the lady asked. \"I need to call her brother,\" Sam said. \"I'll stay here so you can give him a call,\" she said. \"Thank you ma'am,\" Sam said. \"Call me Mariann,\" she said Sam went looking for a pay phone. When he found one, he put some change in and called Benny's work. The phone rang at Benny's Car Clinic. Waldo was holding an old windshield wiper was pretending to conduct an orchestra as he was listening to oldie music on the radio. \"Hey Waldo, quit that and get to work,\" Benny shouted as he went to the phone. He answered it. \"Hello?\" \"Benny, Joon's having a breakdown again at the bus stop. I can't get her to come so I have some nice lady watching her as I'm calling you.\" \"Oh no,\" said Benny. \"I'll be right there. Where are you?\" Sam told him their location. \"Okay, I'll be there,\" said Benny and he hung up. \"I have an emergency again,\" he said. \"Eric close up shop when closing time comes.\" \"Okay,\" Eric said. \"What happened?\" \"It's Joon.\" \"Okay.\" Benny took off his work uniform and hung it up and went out his car. He got in and drove off. When he got to the bus stop, he saw Joon crying. She was walking around in circles flapping her arms and hands and screaming phrases. While Benny was coming, the bus did come and stopped but Sam didn't get on. He couldn't leave Joon so the bus kept on going. The lady wasn't there anymore because Sam had told her he'd be fine now because Joon's brother was on his way. Benny got out of his car. \"Joon,\" he shouted. He noticed some people were watching but he ignored it. \"I'm here, I can take you and Sam home now,\" he shouted. He put his arms around her. Joon kept crying and screaming. Then she screamed, \"Don't you touch me.\" \"Joon,\" Benny said again. \"I don't need to take you to the hospital again.\" Joon heard the word. \"Nooo,\" she screamed. \"Then calm down.\" But Joon also hated those words. It felt like he didn't understand how she was feeling and where she was coming from and he wants her to be calm? Joon screamed harder and tried to get away. Benny kept his grip on her. He pulled her to his car. Sam came over to them and he grabbed her hand. \"Joon,\" Sam said again. \"It's okay now, we're going home in Benny's car.\" \"I think we might need to call the ambulance,\" Benny said. \"Okay,\" Sam said. He hated to see Joon go to the hospital but it was for her own good since she was unable to calm down all because the bus didn't show up. Sam headed to the pay phone and called the ambulance.[Chapter 10] Joon was taken to the hospital. The same place she had been to before when she had the breakdown on the bus. She was sedated to calm her down when the paramedics came and this time she wasn't in the closed ward. She didn't mind Sam being there or Benny. Joon was lying in bed all calm. \"We're going to have to get a ride to take the test and back,\" Sam told her. \"No more getting dropped off and having you take buses. If we can't get a ride, we can't go to the DMV. I don't want to go through this again.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Joon. \"It's okay,\" said Benny. Then Dr. Garvey came in the room. She was called and informed about her episode. She came in to evaluate Joon and check up on her. \"How are you feeling Joon?\" she asked. \"Better,\" she said. \"Do you mind the other two being here when I talk to you?\" \"No,\" said Joon. \"Okay. So tell me, what happened that brought you here?\" \"The buses are cursed,\" said Joon. \"Sam made me ride them so we could take the written test.\" \"Written test?\" Dr. Garvey asked. \"We're going to get our license,\" Sam asked. \"A driver's license?\" \"Yes,\" said Joon. \"Okay now back to the buses. How are they cursed?\" Joon told her what Sam had been experiencing with them so that was why she didn't want to ride them. She didn't want to risk getting stuck. \"Those buses are old,\" said Dr. Garvey. \"Thank god they are going to get new ones I hear.\" \"Oh good,\" said Sam. \"I bet you're happy about that,\" Benny told Joon. \"So what is this about you getting your driver's license?\" Dr. Garvey asked Joon. \"So I can be more independent, and we can get to places than having to take the bus or wait for it to come. And it's a lot easier when you go grocery shopping and when Sam buys my supplies,\" Joon said. \"So how do you plan on getting a car?\" \"I got them one,\" Benny informed. \"Now I'm working on fixing it up to make it all nice and new again. \"Okay, well Joon, you're aware driving is a big responsibility? Do you think you can handle it?\" \"Yes,\" said Joon. \"Tell me what you are doing to get your license?\" \"I have been studying and helping Sam with it too and I took my first written test and failed it.\" \"Well Joon after checking in on you at your new apartment and hearing how well you have been doing, having less episodes, and going for a long period of time without this kind, I'd say you are doing very good and you're good to go.\" \"She can leave today?\" Benny asked. \"Yes. I'll sign for her release.\" Dr. Garvey got up and left the room. Joon was happy she be going home. She wanted to go home and be in Sam's arms. Joon got out of bed. Her clothes were given back to her. Joon changed into them and they all left. Benny went to the front desk to check Joon out. Sam was happy Joon was well again. \"I promise you no more buses,\" Sam told her. \"But now we both have to be patient to take our written tests. We have to wait till Benny, Jen or Ruthie are available to take us and be willing to wait and then take us home again.\" \"Okay,\" said Joon. Benny took them both home to their apartment. \"Benny,\" Joon said. \"Can you take us to the DMV tomorrow and then wait for me to take the test and then take us home again?\" \"Okay,\" said Benny. \"I'll do it first thing before work.\"[Chapter 11] Joon was so happy to be home in her apartment. It was late in the evening and Sam and Joon both cuddled on the couch watching an old movie. They both had already ate. Sam cooked once they got home. Benny didn't even bother to tell Ruthie or anyone else Joon was in the hospital. He didn't need the sympathy. Maybe Jennifer wouldn't have really cared since she always seemed to act like she didn't give a darn about things or maybe she did care but just didn't know how to show it. He could remember her talking about her ex husband and how he thought she didn't have empathy and she said she does. Just because she doesn't care about certain people such as Mike, doesn't mean she doesn't have it, it just means she doesn't have it for them. She even said she wouldn't care if Mike got killed. It be victory even if it means he wouldn't be around for her to pick on but he hardly came to the poker games anyway. - The next day Benny came over to Ruthie's building to pick up Sam and Joon. They were all ready to go. Joon put on the helmet once she got in the car. Sam sat in the passenger seat as Joon sat in the middle. Benny took them to the DMV. He parked his car once he got there and they all went inside. Joon grabbed two numbers and sat down. Benny sat with them. Joon took out the driver's manual and started to read the questions to him and the answers. When their number was called, Sam and Joon got up. \"Uh Benny,\" Sam said. \"I need someone to read the test to me and the answers so I can select one of them but Joon can't do it because she is taking the test and I need to someone who isn't taking the test to help me.\" \"Sure,\" said Benny. \"I'll do it.\" They went to the counter and they were handed the written tests and taken to the room. \"I'm here to help him with the test,\" Benny told the lady. \"He needs someone to read the questions to him and the answers.\" \"Does he have vision problems?\" \"No he just has difficulty with reading,\" Benny replied. \"Okay wonderful but I'm going to have to send someone to watch you to make sure you aren't here to give him the answers,\" the lady said. \"Okay, that be fine.\" Joon was already in the room sitting at one of the booths taking the test. Benny and Sam came in the room and sat at one of the booths and waited for someone to come in with the test and stand right behind them and watch. Then a man who works at the DMV came in and handed the test to Sam. \"Okay, you will read the test to him and if you give out one answer to him, you both will be sent out and he automatically fails the test,\" the guy explained to Benny. There were already pencils at the booths so Sam picked one up and Benny started to read the questions to him and the answers. The guy stood close by listening and watching. Benny ignored the guy pretending he wasn't there. Sam did his best to ignore him but he felt distracted so he worked hard keeping his concentration on the test. He even had to have Benny repeat the question again and the answers and explain what a question meant when Sam didn't understand it. Benny didn't give them the answer he thought was correct. Joon heard Benny helping Sam with the test. She kept concentrating on her test and reading each question carefully and the answers. After she was done answering them all, she read it all over again to make sure she answered each question correctly. She didn't want to have accidentally put in the wrong answer and she doesn't pass the test. After she was done, she put her number two pencil down and picked up her test and left the room. She brought it to the counter and handed it to the guy. \"Done?\" Joon nodded. \"I'll check your answers so wait here.\" He left and Joon waited. She drummed her fingers on the counter and fiddled with her necklace. Five minutes later, the guy came back. \"Did I pass?\" Joon asked anxiously. The guy nodded. \"You only got four wrong. Now you need come over here and read this chart to me.\" Joon followed the guy to the eye chart and had her stand ten feet away and had her read the top line to him. She did and the guy said \"Perfect.\" Then he pointed to the forth line. \"Now I need you to read this line.\" Joon read it and the guy said \"Okay.\" Then he pointed to the seventh line. Joon read it and he said \"Alright.\" \"Did I pass?\" Joon asked. \"Yes you did. Now I need to you look at this chart here.\" He took out the color chart and told her to tell him the colors on one line. Joon told him and he said \"Okay.\" Then he checked her depth perception. Joon passed. Then the guy said he needed her to pay for her written test. \"My finacee has the money so he will pay when he is done with his test,\" Joon said. \"Okay, no problem,\" he said. Joon sat down and waited. Fifteen minutes later, Benny and Sam came out. Joon got up and followed them to the counter. They had to wait on the person in front of them who was getting his answers checked. When the guy came back with his test and told him how many he got wrong, he had passed so Sam and Joon had to wait even longer. They waited fifteen more minutes on the person. After he was done, the guy came back to the counter and checked the answers on Sam's test. Sam tapped his cane on the ground and paced up and down as he waited. Then the guy came back. \"Did he pass?\" Joon asked anxiously again. Sam saw the guy had came back with his test and went back to the counter. \"Did I pass?\" he asked. \"You got ten wrong. You can take it again in another four hours.\" \"I need to get to work you guys,\" Benny informed Sam and Joon. \"I can take him again next week. I can't afford to lose money everyday by taking you two here.\" \"That's okay, I can wait,\" said Sam. \"I need to schedule the driving test now,\" said Joon. \"You don't have a car yet,\" said Benny. \"I can use yours,\" she said. \"But then you still won't be able to drive because you don't have a car yet. You will be stuck with a license without a car.\" \"So what's wrong with that?\" Joon asked. \"You really want your driver's lisence without your car yet?\" Benny asked. \"Yes,\" said Joon. She wanted to get it out of the way. \"I'm real nervous about you driving my car.\" \"You're afraid I'm going to crash?\" Joon asked. \"You let me try out to get my license and now you're worried about me crashing your car? Don't you find that ironic Benjamin?\" Benny sighed. \"Okay fine, you can use my car. I know where the garage is when it needs it.\" Joon jumped up and down and flapped her arms. \"Oh thank you Benny,\" she said as she hugged him. \"Thank you thank you.\" Now she had a driving test she had to schedule.[Chapter 12] Sam was sad he didn't pass. It may be Spokane but the knowledge tests were pricey for each time you take it. Twenty dollars was pricey because it cost them forty dollars total. He had spent sixty so far. He just hoped Joon would pass her driving test so he wouldn't have to keep paying for her. Benny dropped them off back at their apartment. he told them they can ask Ruthie or Jennifer to take them back for Joon's driving or for his test but don't expect them to do it if they can't. Jennifer would be out of the question because she would not skip work just to take them and then wait and then take them home and go to work. She didn't want to lose her job. Ruthie might be out of the question too because she also worked. She also doesn't want to lose her job so she wouldn't be able to take them in and wait on them and then take them home again and then head to work. All they could do now was count on Benny. He couldn't fire himself because he owned the business so he was his own boss. \"Hey maybe Peter can take us,\" Joon said. \"He's a rich snob so he can come here and take us.\" \"Joon, he lives out of town,\" Sam said. \"But he doesn't work and he spends all his money on Jennifer and Jason so of course he can take us. Wow she sure has become useful now, hallelujah.\" \"But didn't Jennifer say he is busy with his camp?\" Sam asked, Joon stopped. \"Oh, yeah. I wish she quit her job. She doesn't even need it anymore.\" She didn't understand why Jennifer would still work if she has Peter. He could get her anything. He could even buy her a house if he wanted to since he had that much money, actually more than that. He had earned it from his tours in the eighties so he was a millionaire. More of a two millionaire. Why did she still have her old car and not have a fancy modern one? Peter could buy her one. He even used to take her around in a helicopter. That's how rich he was. He could do about anything. Heck he could even pay Discovery Zone to have it closed so only they would be there and Jason would have all the equipment to himself to play on. He actually did do it once and Jennifer told him how nice it was because there was no noise and she didn't have to worry about stepping on any kids with her clumsy moves and Jason can bury himself in the ball pits and it won't be dangerous because there aren't any other kids and grownups and teens playing. Peter was nice to pay all the employees there who didn't work that day because they were un needed. There was at least one employee there who ran the place and watched them. Jennifer even got to swing on the swing kids used to swing across the ball pit but they weren't allowed to hang on it with their legs or swing on it by sitting on it but Jennifer got to do it all. It was heaven she got to be a kid again. Discovery Zone didn't even exist when she was little so she envied her son when she and her husband take him there when they lived in LA. Sam suggested to Joon maybe reason why Jennifer is still working is because they could still break up so she is just being safe. He also suggested the reason why she doesn't have fancy things from him such as having a fancy car or even having a house is because she isn't a user and she isn't after his money so she isn't asking for that stuff. Joon was going to be taking her driving test the following week. Sam said he could wait to get his license because he wasn't in any rush. Plus he can't afford to keep failing the test and keep paying to take it every time or else they won't be able to pay their bills. Luckily it was Spokane so the rent wasn't high but they still didn't pay the full rent, Benny paid for part of it until section 8 took over. Joon was on social security and Benny was her payee until he signed it over to her. Joon spent her extra money on her supplies. - Joon's birthday came. Sam and Ruthie got Joon a cake at the supermarket down the street. Sam had gotten her something from Boo Radleys. Benny showed up with a present for Joon. Jennifer and Jason pulled up and parked in front of Ruthie's building and they both got out. Jason ran with the presents in his hand. Jennifer trailed behind him. Jason threw open the doors and ran up to Sam and Joon's apartment door. Jason was about to turn the handle when Jennifer shouted at him to knock first. He curled his hand up and started knocking. He kept knocking and wouldn't stop. \"Okay, I think that's good,\" Jennifer said. Jason kept knocking. \"You can stop knocking now,\" his mother said again. Jason stopped knocking and asked her why. \"Because you only need to knock for a few seconds,\" she said. \"Why?\" Before Jennifer could answer, the door opened. \"Hi,\" Sam said. \"Come in.\" Jennifer and Jason walked right in and Sam closed the door. \"Which one of you was the long knocker?\" Ruthie asked. \"Him,\" Jennifer pointed to her son. \"Excited aren't you?\" Ruthie said. \"When do we have cake?\" Jason asked. \"Uh soon,\" Benny said. \"How long is soon?\" Benny sighed. \"Tell him the minutes,\" Jennifer ordered. \"We don't know when, that's the problem,\" Ruthie said. \"Lets have it now,\" Jason said. \"Hold on,\" said Ruthie. \"She means wait,\" Jennifer told him. Jason was literal so he didn't understand idioms yet so Jennifer had to tell him what Ruthie meant in case he got confused. Joon looked at the presents she got. \"Can I open them now?\" she asked. \"Sure, why not,\" said Ruthie. Joon smiled and touched her ear. Jason was anxious for her to open them. He wanted to see what else she got. Joon picked up the present from Sam. She opened it and saw it was a jumbo Treasure Troll. \"Hold it up so everyone can see,\" Benny said. Joon held it up in the air. \"That's the biggest troll I have ever seen,\" said Jennifer. \"Where did you get it?\" Ruthie asked. \"Boo Radleys,\" Sam said. Jason didn't say anything about Joon getting a toy, he had seen her other toys she had in her bedroom so he was used to seeing a grown up with toys, plus his mother had a bunch of stuff animals in the net hanging above her bed and she had coloring books and watched Dumbo and kid shows and teens, plus she had a pacifier. He had found it in her room before when he still lived in LA and he asked her why she had it and she just said he knows how she tends to put things in her mouth and suck on it or chew on it, so she got herself a pacifier so she has something to suck on. He was weirded out by it at first but then got used to it. He found other weird things out about her and also got weirded out by it too but accepted she wasn't normal either but sometimes he still wished she was normal. Joon wasn't normal, nor was Peter, or Sam and him. Ruthie told him there was no such thing as normal and everybody is different. Look at Claudia, is she abnormal because she is deaf? Is Mike abnormal because he is a jerk? Is his teacher abnormal because he is gay? Is Eric abnormal because he is overweight? Is Thomas abnormal because he is divorced? Is Benny abnormal because he gets over protective of Joon sometimes? Ruthie wondered what would happen if Mike had a condition too and he didn't even know it? What would his reaction be if he found out? Would it make him be nice to the misfits? That's what Sam, Joon, Jason, and Jennifer were known as. For some reason, Claudia wasn't abnormal enough for Mike. Simple, she couldn't hear so being a jerk to her wouldn't do him any good because she won't hear him. Peter also wasn't abnormal enough for him because he was a famous rock star so it was acceptable for them all to be weird and different. Mike was just too stupid to see it wasn't his persona. Everyone else could tell Peter was different but Jennifer and Jason didn't pick up on it because he was normal to them. Oh Mike had a condition alright. It was Jerk Personality Disorder. Ruthie made that one up since doctors like to make labels up for everything so why not make her own too. She also had for him, Ignorant syndrome. People are born with it so they are so ignorant and un understanding about differences in people or maybe she had a condition where it makes her see people for them and accept them for them and she can see through their difference because the ignorance was the majority. It was a gift then she had. Benny had a condition, Overprotective Brother syndrome because he was over protective of Joon he treated her like his child and kept her sheltered, then he had to let her grow up by letting her go, try and have her live in her own apartment and have a relationship with Sam. Now he had pretty much recovered from it but still suffered it a little bit because he was worried about her getting her license. Joon opened Benny's next. It was an art set. Joon opened it and held it in the air. Benny even got her a new sketchbook. Then she opened Jason's next. After she opened everyone's gifts, Sam carried the cake to the table. It said 'Happy Birthday Juniper.' \"That name makes me think of Jupiter,\" said Jennifer. \"You say that every time you see that name, you know that?\" Benny said. \"I do?\" Jennifer asked. \"I didn't know that. How often do I say it?\" \"Every time you see the name.\" \"Oh.\" Ruthie started to sing a song by Donovan. \"Jennifer Juniper lives upon the hill Jennifer Juniper sitting very still.\" \"What are you singing?\" Benny asked. \"Jennifer Juniper,\" she said. \"It's an old song.\" \"That's funny, we have a Jennifer and a Juniper here.\" \"That's why the song popped in my head,\" Ruthie said. Ruthie kept humming the song as Sam took the candles out of the box and put them on the cake. Jason helped. He loved putting candles on. Then Sam counted how many were on the cake. \"Five more,\" he said. They put five more on the cake and Sam said that was enough. \"We still have those left,\" Jason pointed to the four candles on the table. \"We only need twenty six on the cake,\" Sam said. \"Joon isn't turning thirty.\" Jason knew when you turn a different age, you have that many candles on your cake to blow out. He had seen his mother get a lot on her cake too but not his dad because he said he was too old and there be too many holes on the cake and wax because it took them that long to light them all and they melt so the wax gets on the cake. He was a lot older than his wife and left them when he was in his early forties. Then Sam lit one of the big candles and he used it to light the candles on the cake. Benny decided to help out by taking another big candle and lighting it and then lighting the other candles. After they were done, they blew out the big candles and set them on the table and everyone started to sing happy birthday. When they got to the \"dear\" part, everyone said \"Joon\" except for Jennifer. She said \"Juniper\" thinking that was the name because it was on the cake. She felt stupid for not knowing. After they were done singing, Joon took a deep breath and blew out all the candles, well almost, only five were left lit so she had to blow those out. Then Jennifer started to take the candles off the cake and licking the frosting off. \"Jen hold on, let me get something to put them on,\" Sam said. He went and got a little saucer and came back and put it on the table. Jason started to pick the candles off the cake too and Joon. She just took them off and put them on the saucer. Jason and Jennifer took them and licked the frosting off them. After all the candles were off the cake, Ruthie got a knife and plates and handed the knife to Joon. \"Okay, everyone tell me how big of piece you want,\" she said. \"I want the corner and I want it this big,\" Jennifer said as she showed Joon. Joon cut the big piece. She slid the knife under the piece and picked it up and put it on the plate. Jennifer took it. \"Hey where are the forks?\" \"Oh,\" said Sam. \"Ruthie, you forgot forks.\" \"Oh my bad, sorry,\" she said. Sam got the forks and brought them to the table. Jennifer picked one up and started to have to piece. Joon cut everyone else a piece and they all ate. \"That's a pretty big piece you have Jen,\" said Benny. \"I love sweets,\" Jennifer said. \"I'm a sweet person.\" \"No one is sweeter than my Sam,\" said Joon. \"I didn't know he ate lot of sweets too,\" Jennifer joked. \"How does he even stay thin?\" \"The buses keep breaking down so I have to walk,\" Sam joked back. \"Really?\" Jennifer asked. \"It's a joke Jennifer,\" Ruthie said. \"Oh.\" After she was done with her piece, she went and grabbed another piece. Jason had another piece too. Ruthie and Sam were fine with having one piece. Joon had another piece and so did Sam. Jennifer had a big piece again and was full. Jason couldn't finish his second piece. \"Is there anything to drink?\" Jennifer asked. \"Just water,\" said Ruthie. \"The glasses are in the cupboard next to the fridge. Jennifer went in the kitchen and grabbed an empty class and filled it up at the sink. She had a drink and poured the rest out. Then everyone left. Benny went back home, Jennifer left with Jason, and Ruthie stuck around and chatted with Sam and Joon.[Chapter 13] Joon's driving test came. Benny took her and Sam in. He decided he was not going to take his written test again because he didn't want to spend another twenty dollars. He had to spend it on Joon for her test. Besides there was no point in taking the test because they didn't have a car yet. Benny was still working on it. Benny parked his car and they all went inside. Joon checked in and said she was there for her driving test. The lady asked for her name. \"Juniper Pearl,\" Joon said. The lady looked on the self at the P section and found her name. There was her form in the folder she had filled out to get her license. \"Okay. Take a seat and we'll be right with you.\" Joon, Sam, and Benny sat down. \"Are you going to take the written test?\" Benny asked Sam. \"No,\" said Sam. \"Why?\" \"No car.\" Sam hoped Joon would pass the test. They waited and then Joon's name was called. Benny handed her his keys. \"This is the key here to the car,\" Benny pointed. Joon took the keys from him. Sam got up too and followed after her and the examiner. \"Do you need me to come with you Joon?\" Sam asked. \"I'm sorry, only the driver and the examiner can be in the car,\" she told him. \"I'll be okay Sam,\" Joon said. Sam sat back down and Joon and the lady headed outside to Benny's car. Joon opened the car door and got in. She put the key in the ignition and started it. The examiner asked for proof of insurance. Joon opened the glove box and took out everything and handed it to her. \"I only need to see the proof of insurance,\" she said. \"I don't know which one it is,\" said Joon. The examiner took the stuff and looked through it and found the insurance card. \"Okay, you're good.\" She handed the stuff back to Joon and she put it back in the glove box. She got back in the car. \"Okay turn your lights on low beam,\" said the examiner. Benny had shown Joon where to turn on the lights and the brights and how to turn on the wind shield wipers and where the break pedal is and the gas pedal, how to put it in park and drive, reverse and neutral. Joon turned on the lights. \"Okay high beam,\" the examiner said. Joon had a little trouble putting them on high beam but she figured it out and did it. \"Low beam.\" Joon turned the brights off. \"Turn your lights off now and put on the break.\" Joon stepped on the break and the examiner looked behind the car. After they were done with that part of testing, the examiner came in the car kicking Joon's helmet out of the way. Joon remembered to put on her seat belt. Joon hated wearing it because she didn't like how it felt on her but Benny told her she better wear it when she takes the test because they mark down everything you don't do such as not wearing a seat belt, not looking both ways before you turn on the road, not going the speed limit, forgetting to signal, driving through empty parking spaces, they want you to do everything right. Joon didn't wear her helmet. She didn't need to. Benny wasn't driving and she was. \"Okay you start out with one hundred points,\" she said. \"You lose points when you do an error, you lose one hundred if you hit another car, a person, do any collision, do any road kills. There will be no tricks and asking you to do anything illegal. I will try and not confuse you and if you don't understand what I tell you to do, just ask and I will rephrase it. At the end of the test I will add up your score and tell you what you got. You need to have eighty or above to pass.\" Then the real testing began. Joon was told to pull out of the parking spot to the right. \"That way?\" Joon pointed. \"Yes,\" said the examiner. Joon turned the El Camino right. \"Okay, now you will exit the parking lot over there and turn right,\" the examiner pointed. Joon did just that and remembered to turn on the signal but she forgot to look both ways so the examiner knocked down her points. She kept driving down the road and then she was told to take a right. Joon took a right. She remembered too look both ways this time. It was the main road so she had to look both ways since it had more cars on it so there were constant changes due to lot of cars being on the road. Then she was told to get in the left lane so Joon did that forgetting to turn on her signal and forgetting to turn her head to look behind her. She looked in the outside mirror and the rare view mirror instead. The examiner docked her points. Then she told Joon to make the left turn up ahead. Joon went in the turn only lane forgetting to signal again. Then she turned her signal on when she stopped and then she turned. Then she was told to pull into the parking lot. Then she was told to pull into one of the parking spaces. Joon parked the car. \"Juniper, you need to remember to look behind you when you switch lanes. You need to remember to signal when you switch lanes. You need to look both ways before you turn onto the street, even if there are no cars on it or hardly any. There are blind spots.\" \"Did I pass?\" Joon asked. The examiner shook her head. \"You lost too many points due to those errors. You got down to seventy six. Four points each you lost.\" \"When can I take the test again?\" \"After one week.\" \"So that means I can take it again next week?\" Joon asked. \"Yes, after seven days. Okay, now we're heading back to the DMV.\" Joon pulled out of the parking spot and didn't even bother to look both ways again when she turned onto the street. She failed the test so she didn't take it serious anymore. \"I am still marking your points,\" the examiner said. \"But I failed,\" Joon pointed out. \"Doesn't matter. We're still doing the driving test, it's not over til we get back and turn off the car.\" So Joon obeyed the rules of the road. She remembered to signal and look both ways before turning onto the main road. When she got back to Lidgerwood Street, she turned on it using her signal. When she got back to the DMV, she parked the car and turned off the ignition and took the keys out. The examiner added up the points she lost and told her the score. She discussed the results and all her errors she did. When she was done, they both got out of the car and went inside. Sam got out of his chair and walked up to Joon. \"Did you pass?\" Joon shook her head. \"How's my car?\" Benny asked. \"Did you wreck it?\" \"No Benny,\" said Joon. \"Pay up front,\" the examiner said. Benny, Sam, and Joon went to the counter to pay for the test. Sam took out his wallet and opened it and said \"I don't have enough cash.\" Joon reached into her pouch and pulled out her checkbook and pen. She opened it and started to make out the check. Then she asked who she makes it out to. After she was done, she ripped out the check and handed it to the guy. \"When are you going to take the test again?\" Benny asked. \"Next week after seven days?\" said Joon. \"How much money do we have left in the bank?\" Sam asked. \"We have to pay our bills.\" \"Joon, how about we just hold off and let you practice driving before your next test?\" Benny suggested. \"Can she practice driving before her next test?\" Benny asked the guy at the counter. \"No she needs a learner's permit,\" the guy said. \"How do we get it?\" \"Well she needs to bring in her proof of identity and residence.\" \"Okay so what will she need?\" \"Social security number or birth certificate, ID, anything that shows her proof of residence.\" \"I already did all that,\" Joon said. The guy looked in the folder again and said she had already did all that and passed the screening for her vision and colors. \"It will be another twenty dollars.\" Sam eyes widened. \"I'll pay for it,\" said Benny. \"I want you guys to be able to save money for your bills.\" He took out his check book and paid for the learner's permit. \"When will she get it?\" \"Now. We just need to take her photo so we can print it and give it to her.\" \"Can he get his too?\" Benny asked pointing to Sam. \"Did he pass the knowledge test?\" \"No,\" Sam said. \"He has to pass it first before he can get it,\" the guy said. Sam could wait. \"Joon what are you going to do when you pass the test and get your license?\" Sam asked. \"I can drive then,\" said Joon. \"But we don't have a car yet.\" \"So, at least it be out of the way.\" So that's what this was about. Joon wanted to get this all done so she wouldn't have to do it later. Joon was sent over to the wall and another employee took a photo of her. Then she waited for her learner's permit. The guy came back with a printed learner's permit. It looked like a license except it was on paper. \"Okay Juniper, you can only drive with someone in the car who has a valid driver's license and is at least twenty-one years of age and has to sit in the passenger seat in the front. You cannot drive out of the state of Washington.\" \"Okay,\" said Joon as she put her learner's permit in her pouch. \"Can I drive home Benny?\" \"There can only be one person in the car with you,\" the guy said again. \"Sorry Joon,\" said Benny. \"I want to schedule my driving test again,\" said Joon. \"Joon I thought you wanted to practice driving first,\" Benny pointed out. \"Yeah I want to practice driving before my test comes again.\" \"Okay fine,\" Benny sighed. So Joon scheduled her appointment for the test again. Because they were booked, it be in twelve days instead of eight. They all left and Joon handed the keys to Benny. He looked at his watch. \"When can I practice driving?\" Joon asked anxiously. \"How about after work but then it slow the work down on your car,\" Benny said. \"Okay,\" said Joon. She just wanted to get on with her driving test so she can be done with it and Benny can go back to working on her car. On the way home Benny explained everything to Joon what he was doing. \"You do a complete stop at the stop sign,\" said Benny. \"Not a rolling stop like I always do.\" \"Remember to signal when you switch lanes and turn your head like this before you go in the next lane.\" Benny had to signal as he switched just to show Joon and he had to turn his head before he went in the next lane. He was obeying every rule on the road because Joon had to learn the driving skills to pass the test. \"Joon I want you to watch me and pay attention,\" Benny said again when he noticed Joon wasn't looking at him. \"I know how you drive,\" she said. \"I want you to know the skills you need to use that would hep you pass the test,\" said Benny. \"You don't want to keep failing the test. They make you wait longer to take it again every time you fail.\" \"Why?\" Joon asked. \"I guess it's so you have time to practice,\" Benny said. So Joon watched him on the way home. I tried to make the whole DMV thing accurate. I don't know how long it takes to get a learner's permit. In Montana I automatically got one after I took the written test but each state is different. I didn't even know you had to apply for one in Washington until I looked it up online. I don't even know if the tests cost twenty dollars back then too. I also went by experience when I got my first license. Filling out the form and getting your photo taken, taking the written test, getting your eye sight tested and seeing how well you can see color after you past the test and they test your depth perception. Now to schedule the driving test.[Chapter 14] Joon practiced her driving skills every day after Benny get off from work. He take her out for a drive in the neighborhood and have her do different things like parallel park. He would even take her to her neighborhood and have her drive there. He have her back the car out backwards in front of his house. After three days of practice, Ruthie decided she help Joon out too so she had her drive her car while Ruthie sit in the passenger seat. She let her get on the main roads and have her practice switching lanes remembering to signal and look behind her than looking in the mirrors only. Ruthie also told her about blind spots. \"There are blind spots so you must look behind you before you switch lanes because the car beside you won't always appear in the mirrors,\" she said. Joon felt happy she was driving. She hoped she would pass her driving test next time. * * * Benny got a phone call from Eric. \"Hello?\" he said. \"Benny, Claudia is in labor. We're at the hospital,\" Eric said. \"Has the baby come yet?\" \"No, she is still pushing and the nurses are trying.\" \"How long have you guys been there?\" \"About forty five minutes.\" After they hung up, Benny called Ruthie and told her the news. Ruthie was happy their baby was coming. Then she called Jennifer and told her the news. \"Oh,\" she said. Then she called Peter and told Jason the news. He was happy the baby was coming. He was going to be a god brother. He always wanted a little brother or sister because he felt left out at school that everyone else had brothers and sisters and he didn't. Eric had told him he can be their child's god brother when he or she comes. Jennifer didn't want anymore kids. Jason was unplanned because she used poor judgment in her early twenties. She hated kids because she grew up being picked on by them but she felt too strongly attached to her unborn child to even put it up for an adoption when she found out she was pregnant. She decided she would just show everyone. She wouldn't let her kid run wild and be a spoiled brat, bully other kids, and be disrespectful. But she found some kids to be acceptable such as Lindsay because she wasn't a spoiled brat and didn't bully other kids. In fact she reminded Jennifer of herself from when she was a kid. She wouldn't hate Eric and Claudia's kid after they have it because what can babies do to hurt you? They were innocent and were incapable of meanness. They couldn't even do anything except wet and mess themselves, cry, eat, sleep, crawl, and have their minds continuing to develop and their immune system and their muscles and skull. Thomas and Mike got the news too about Claudia being in labor. Mike acted nice about it but then turned into a jerk again. \"Congratulations to them,\" Mike said. \"Their very first child. I just hope it will be normal instead of a nutcase. I don't need anymore of them.\" He already was dealing with four of them, Peter didn't count because he was a rock star. For some reason he didn't count Claudia. But one of the nutcases was picking on him and bullying him and her boyfriend takes her side. Joon should be in a mental hospital and Jason and Jennifer were whatever, (he didn't know what to call them) and so was Sam. They were all stupid. They should be in a group home and Jason should be in a place for defective kids. Peter was crazy for choosing to be with Jennifer and Ruthie was crazy too for even being her friend and for liking Sam and being his friend too and Joon's. Luckily Mike didn't know everything about her such as her pacifier. Ruthie knew about it and Joon and Peter and Sam but they didn't say a thing about it. It was one of her sensations. Joon slept with her stuffed monkey but it wasn't unusual to sleep with a stuffed animal vs using a pacifier but it was the style anyway. Some teens went around using pacifiers in their mouths. It must have been a fad for teens. Ruthie had seen it a few times at places and told Jennifer about it and asked her if she has ever seen it. She said she had and it makes her feel happy inside because she isn't alone but she can't bare to use it out in public. Ruthie told her it was okay and everyone has a private thing about themselves. Ruthie had something private about herself and Joon too and Sam kept it private. Benny knew but didn't care. He tried it himself and liked it. It all started with Jennifer and she got Ruthie into it and then she got Joon into it. Peter knew about them too because Jennifer had told him but he didn't care. He had his own private stuff too. Could Mike have anything too he does privately he didn't want anyone knowing about? Sam and Joon got the news from Ruthie about Claudia being in labor. \"That's wonderful,\" said Sam. \"Ouch,\" said Joon. \"I can wait till that happens to me.\" Claudia was in labor for twelve hours before their baby was delivered. It was a baby girl. They named her Ivy. They already had the name picked out. Claudia was pooped. She sweat buckets and she was happy the labor was over. Now she felt exhausted. She got to see their child before the nurses had to weigh her and measure her height and take her foot print. they placed a ID bracelet around her little wrist and put her in the nursery with the other babies. Eric called Benny and told him the news. \"Ivy was born today at six twenty AM,\" he said. \"Alright,\" said Benny. \"Congratulations.\" He called Ruthie and told her the news. \"Congratulations to them,\" said Ruthie. \"I'll go tell Sam and Joon and Jennifer.\" Ruthie went next door and told Sam and Joon the news. \"Eric and Claudia had their child. She was delivered this morning at six twenty AM,\" said Ruthie. \"What did they name her?\" Joon asked. \"Ivy,\" Ruthie said. Then she called Jennifer and told her the news. \"Eric and Claudia just had their baby this morning at six twenty AM,\" Ruthie said. \"They named her Ivy.\" \"I'll tell Jason then,\" she said. \"Are you going to see the baby today?\" Ruthie asked. \"I'll see it at the next poker game,\" Jennifer said. \"Okay,\" said Ruthie. After they hung up, Jennifer waited till she was off work to tell Jason and Peter the news. She drove back to his house and told Jason the news. \"Eric and Claudia had their baby today,\" Jennifer told him. \"What did they name her?\" Jason asked. \"Ivy,\" she said. \"That's a weird name.\" Eric and Claudia already knew they were going to have a girl because they were told during her pregnancy. \"Well don't tell them that when you see them again,\" Jennifer said. \"Why?\" Jason asked. \"Because I think it might be rude.\" \"Why?\" \"It just sounds rude is all.\" \"Why?\" \"Because you're saying their child's name is weird. Would you like it if someone told you you have a weird name?\" \"I don't have a weird name,\" Jason said. \"Well someone who has never heard the name Jason might think it's a weird name so would you like it if they told you it's a weird name?\" \"I don't know. What if they ask me what I think of the name?\" \"Then you can tell them that then.\" Jason couldn't imagine how he'd feel if someone told him he had a weird name because he had difficulty with that theory of mind. No one has told him his name was weird so he wouldn't even know how he'd feel. Jennifer had that difficulty too but she was better at it than he was because she was older and had more life experience than him. How did people do it anyway? They were good psychics. That's what she liked calling them. Ruthie called them that too with her. She couldn't relate to it but understood why Jennifer would view it that way. It seemed that way to her because that's how it felt. Now they didn't spend much time together as friends. Jennifer was always with Peter or at home. Only time they saw each other was at the poker games or at special occasions such as holidays or birthdays but they still talked on the phone sometimes. Jennifer hated phones. Ruthie could tell she be annoyed when she be talking to her on the phone because she interrupted her so she let her go. Ruthie, Benny, Joon, and Sam stopped by at the hospital and saw Eric and Claudia and their child. Claudia had Ivy in her arms. They all went up to the bed and looked down at Ivy. She had her eyes closed and she was all wrapped up in a blanket. \"She is so cute,\" Benny said. \"She is very pretty,\" Ruthie said. \"Pretty?\" Joon asked. \"They all look the same.\" Ruthie and Eric chuckled. \"Can I hold her?\" Sam asked Eric. Claudia looked at him raising her eye brows. \"Can we hold her?\" Benny asked using his hand gestures and speaking slowly. Claudia handed him her child. Benny took her and handed her to Sam. Sam held her. \"It feels like I'm holding a doll except this one is alive,\" said Sam. Then they all heard someone walking in the room. They all turned except Claudia. It was Jennifer, and Jason. \"Hi,\" Benny said. \"You're here,\" Ruthie said. \"Where's the baby?\" Jason asked. \"Shhh,\" Ruthie, Eric, and Benny said. \"The baby is sleeping,\" Eric said quietly. \"You need to talk quietly,\" Ruthie said. \"Don't talk loud.\" \"Can I see it?\" Jason asked in a quieter voice. \"Sam has her.\" Jason walked over to Sam. \"I wanna see it I wanna see it.\" \"She's not an 'it,' she's a she,\" said Joon. \"Does your mother call you an 'it'?\" \"No,\" said Jason. \"So you must not call her an 'it' because babies are also human beings.\" \"Can I hold the baby?\" \"She has a name Jason,\" said Joon. \"Does your mother call you ' the kid' or 'the boy?' Call her Ivy.\" \"You guys gave her a name that climbs,\" Jennifer joked. \"Ivy, get it?\" Ruthie smiled. Eric laughed. He thought it was funny. \"I want to hold her,\" Jason said again. \"Ask Eric first,\" said Sam. \"Here let me hold her now,\" said Joon. Sam handed Ivy to Joon. She held her in her arms. Jennifer came up to her and looked at Ivy. \"Can I hold the baby?\" Jason asked again in a excited voice. \"Shhhh,\" Ruthie, Eric, Benny, and Sam hissed. \"Here, sit down right here,\" said Eric. He got out of his chair and had Jason sit down. \"Joon, hand me Ivy please, Jason wants to hold her.\" Joon brought Ivy over to Eric and he took her out of her arms and set her on Jason's lap. \"Remember to put your hand under the back of her head Jason,\" Jennifer told him. Eric showed Jason where to put his hand. \"You must support her head with your hand because babies can't support theirs yet,\" Eric explained. Jason had his hand at the back of Ivy's head and he touched her all over. He felt her little hands, then he started to feel her face. \"Careful Jason,\" Benny said. \"I want to feel it,\" Jason said. \"She's not an it,\" Joon said. \"Is that his autism making him say that?\" \"Joon,\" said Benny. \"Well I read how they see people as objects because they are unaware we have feelings and we are like objects to them,\" Joon said. \"I used to see other people as objects,\" said Jennifer. \"I didn't even know they had feelings when I was little and I would be surprised every time I see someone else cry. I just wish someone told me a lot sooner other people have feelings and can feel the same way I feel and everyone cries, everyone yells. It might have spared me the teasing and I might have had more friends. But no I got told it's because kids figure it out on their own so I was expected to know that too. Now I am teaching my son what I didn't know when I was his age so he's lucky.\" \"Lot of people see babies as 'its,'\" said Benny. \"I'm sure you have seen people saying \"Can we hold it\" \"Where's the baby?\" and didn't you hear Eric calling her 'the baby' also?\" \"Oh my god they're all autistic,\" said Joon. \"Stupid made up condition by doctors,\" Jennifer said. She was better off thinking it was fake than being labeled and thinking she has a kid who isn't normal all because of that label. \"All conditions are made up,\" said Ruthie. \"Whatever is in the minority, doctors like to make it a condition and give it a word.\" \"True,\" said Eric. \"What made you decide to come here Jen?\" Ruthie asked. \"What?\" Jennifer asked. All she heard was her name. \"What made you decide to come here all of a sudden?\" \"Jason wanted to see the baby and he didn't want to wait till the next poker game. I was bored anyway so at least he brought me out of the house,\" and she laughed. Ruthie laughed too. \"She has a name,\" Joon said again. \"Peter could have had someone bring him here but I went \"No I'll bring him just to get out of here,\"\" Jennifer said. \"So boredom makes you flexible then, I see,\" said Ruthie. \"Well now I know another way of making you flexible, bore you to tears.\" \"Oh.\" \"I was kidding Jen you knew that right?\" \"No but okay.\" Jason kept feeling Ivy. \"Be careful,\" Eric told him. Jason felt her little head. \"Careful with the head, don't press too hard, she has a soft spot there.\" \"Why?\" Jason asked. \"Because all babies have soft spots on their head because their skull isn't fully developed so if you press too hard, you can damage their brain and leave them with brain damage.\" \"And it be another person for Mike to hate,\" Jennifer added. \"And another misfit for him to deal with,\" said Ruthie. \"Hey where is he anyway?\" Benny shrugged. \"We don't know,\" said Eric.\"Thomas hasn't shown up either.\" \"Can I hold Ivy now?\" Jennifer asked. \"I thought you hated kids?\" Benny teased. \"Only the bratty ones,\" she said. \"What can she do to be a brat? Barf on me or have her diaper leak on me? Babies are too innocent to be one. They can't even talk yet or walk.\" \"I was teasing,\" said Benny. \"Okay Jason, your mother wants to hold her now,\" Eric said as he picked her up. He handed Ivy to Jennifer. She held her in her arms supporting her head on her arm. \"Hey I'm holding her,\" Jennifer said and started chuckling. \"I haven't held a baby in five years and that was when my brother had one.\" She walked around the room with Ivy in her arms. \"Jen, how old is your brother?\" Benny asked. Jennifer thought for a moment. \"Thirty-six.\" \"Okay let me hold her now Jen,\" said Ruthie. Jennifer was too preoccupied holding Ivy Ruthie had to get her attention. Jennifer looked at her. \"Let me hold her,\" Ruthie said. Jennifer let Ruthie take Ivy from her. Ruthie held her for a few minutes and then Joon wanted to hold her again. Ruthie handed her to Joon. Joon held it. Benny watched her. Then he asked if he could hold Ivy. Joon handed her to him. It was like everyone was playing pass the baby. Benny only got to hold her for a minute when she woke up and started to cry. \"Uh oh,\" said Jennifer. \"Better hand her to her mother,\" said Ruthie. Benny handed Ivy to Claudia. She took her and held her in her arms again. She opened her gown and started to nurse. Jennifer saw it and said \"Look Jason Claudia is nursing the baby.\" \"Shhh,\" Ruthie hissed at her. \"She has a name,\" Joon reminded her. Jennifer was a little too loud when she said it. \"I suppose you called Jason \"the baby\" too when he was one?\" Joon said. \"Yep. I called him \"my baby,\"\" Jennifer said. Jason watched Ivy nurse. Everyone stood around and chatted while Jennifer left the room and wandered around on the floor. Joon just sat and drew in her sketchbook. Sam just stood around tapping his cane. Then Ruthie said she had to get going. \"Are you two coming along?\" Ruthie asked Sam and Joon. Joon closed her sketchbook and put her art pen away in her lunch pail. \"I'll come too,\" said Sam. They all left. Jennifer was back by then and she said she wanted to get going too. \"Come on Jason,\" she said. She took his hand and they both walked out of there. Benny left too. Eric and Claudia stayed with their child. The next day, they took her home. Claudia started to fill out the first part of the baby book. In the movie script, Eric and Claudia had an 8 year old daughter named Ivy and they decided to cut her from the script. I don't know why they did that. So I decided to have them have a baby and it's a girl and they name her Ivy.[Chapter 15] The driving test came again. Joon drive there with Ruthie using everything she had been practicing. \"I hope I pass this time,\" said Joon. \"Are you going to celebrate if you do pass?' Ruthie asked. \"I don't know,\" Joon shrugged. \"Well, where would you like to go?\" \"How about Seattle so I can go up on the Space Needle.\" \"Or how about going to Portland and seeing the rose gardens there. I heard the place is very pretty.\" \"Didn't Jennifer say that place is known for land slides and they get lot of rain?\" \"It does rain there a lot I've heard but I am not sure about land slides but the city is very pretty. I have been through there when I moved here and they do some flea market on the weekends there in downtown,\" Ruthie said. \"I still would rather go on the Space Needle.\" Joon pulled into the parking lot of the DMV and parked Ruthie's Maverick. They both got out and went inside. Joon checked in and took a seat and waited for her name to be called. When her name got called, she followed the examiner outside. It was the same one from last time. \"Oh a different car this time,\" she said. \"I'm getting my own soon,\" said Joon. \"My brother is just working on it.\" \"So who's car is it?\" \"My friend's,\" said Joon. \"Does she have proof of insurance? Show me.\" Joon unlocked the car and reached in the glove box and took out the stuff. She leafed through it looking for the card. Then she handed it to the examiner. She looked through it. \"Okay it's here,\" and she handed it back to Joon. She put it back in the glove box and closed it. She got in the car. The examiner got in the car too and closed the passenger door. She went through all the stuff again about there be no tricks or telling her to do anything illegal and she lose one hundred points for hitting another car or human or doing any collision or road kills. \"I will try and not confuse you and if you don't understand what I am trying to tell you to do, just ask and I will rephrase it,\" the examiner finished. Joon put on her seat belt. The examiner got out of the car and told Joon to turn on the lights and put them on high beam, put on the breaks. After she was done, she got back in the car and they started the test. The test went differently because the examiner told her to go different routes and to different places. Joon remembered to look behind her before she switched lanes, remembered to signal. She even remembered to do a complete stop at the stop signs before she hit the gas pedal again. The test went longer. Joon felt nervous when she hear the examiner mark something on the paper which was the test. \"Now I want to to try parrallel parking right here\" Joon turned on the right hand signal and stopped beside the car , she started to back into the empty space. Joon took her time, she had to make it perfect to pass the test. She wasn't sure how many points she lost. Joon kept working on parallel parking. Why did there have to be two parked cars and a gap in between? She would have just driven in the spot and be done with it but no the car was in the way and the examiner just had to have her park between two cars. Joon kept pulling in and out and trying to park in the spot until she decided she was close enough to the curb. Joon put the car in park. \"Done?\" the examiner asked. \"Yes,\" said Joon. \"Are you sure?\" \"Did I do it wrong?\" Joon asked. \"Do you think you did it right? That's up for you to say. If you think you didn't do it right, you can keep trying.\" \"I think I'm done,\" said Joon.\" \"Okay, I am going to get out of the car now and check the curb and the car in front of you and behind you.\" \"Okay,\" Joon said again. The examiner got out and looked at the curb and in front of the car and behind the car. She wrote it down. When she got back in the car, Joon asked if she passed. \"I'll tell you when we get back,\" the examiner said. \"Now I want you to pull out of the spot and go straight.\" Joon put the car back in drive again and backed up a little and looked behind her to see if there were any cars coming. She pulled out forgetting to even signal. On the way back to the DMV Joon pulled into the next lane cutting off a car despite using her signal so she lost ten points. It was a great risk to cause a collision. The car honked. Joon ignored it. When they got back to the DMV, Joon parked the car and put it in park and turned the engine off. \"Did I pass?\" Joon asked. The examiner started to tell her about her errors without answering her question. She told her she has to remember to signal before she pulls out of the parking spot when she parralleled parked. She has to make sure her car is parked behind the crosswalk in the red light, not of the tip of it over the crosswalk. She has to pay attention to the speed limit signs, and of course she lost ten points when she went in the next lane cutting off a car that could have caused a collision. \"You got a seventy eight.\" Joon banged her head on the steering wheel. She was so close. She had an eighty eight and she lost it by cutting off that one car. Darn it, why did that car have to be there? She would have passed if that car weren't there. \"When can I take it again?\" Joon asked. \"Next week after seven days. You did so good.\" \"But I didn't pass,\" Joon pointed out. \"But you got a seventy eight, that's very good. It could have been worse. If you got below seventy, you would have had to wait two weeks to take it again,\" the examiner said. \"Just remember to look in the rare view mirror and wait till the car is behind you far enough before you switch into the lane so the person in it doesn't have to slam on their breaks or have to honk at you.\" \"Is that why someone honked?\" Joon asked. \"Yes.\" They both got out of the car and went inside. Joon scheduled the driving test again for next week. \"Did you pass?\" Ruthie asked when she walked up to her. \"No,\" said Joon. \"But I was so close. That one car just had to be in my way.\" \"So when are you going to take it again?\" \"Next week on Friday.\" Now she couldn't wait till next Friday. She would just keep practicing her driving everyday. Ruthie let her drive home again back to their apartment.[Chapter 16] Joon still worked on her driving in the evenings. Ruthie even asked her if she wanted to drive out to camp Faltskog and see what Jason is up to. Too bad Sam couldn't come but he was cool staying behind. He wanted Joon to be happy. So they both drove out there. It was a forty-forty five minute drive there. They came up to the gates and Joon slowed down. \"Remember to turn on your signal,\" Ruthie reminded her. Joon turned on her right hand signal and pulled into the parking lot. She saw two security guards opening the gates for them. Joon parked in front of Peter's house and they both got out. They both walked around seeing all the kids. \"I wonder where Jason is?\" Joon said. \"I wonder where Peter is?\" Ruthie said. They checked the mess hall, the stage, then they checked Peter's backyard. They heard Jennifer laughing and Jason talking. Joon and Ruthie saw them on moon shoes walking around on them and jumping and they both had helmets on and knee pads and elbow pads. Jason kept falling down and so did Jennifer. They both kept getting up. Jennifer saw them but didn't say anything. Joon and Ruthie walked up to them. \"What are those on your feet?\" Ruthie asked. \"Moon shoes,\" Jennifer said. \"Where did you get them?\" Joon asked. \"Toys R Us.\" \"Is really hard being on those?\" Ruthie asked. \"Yeah, sort of,\" said Jennifer. \"But it's so much fun. Jason's therapist said these will help his balance and coordination. You should get them too.\" \"How much do they cost?\" said Ruthie. \"Forty bucks.\" \"Forty?\" Ruthie asked. \"Each?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Oh my, that's expensive.\" \"You should get some Ruthie, they are so much fun, just buy some protective gear too and wear a helmet,\" Jennifer informed. \"These are hard to walk in but they are lot of fun.\" \"Can I try them first?\" Ruthie asked. \"Uh sure.\" Jennifer fell down on purpose and took them off. \"There you go, put them on.\" Ruthie picked one of them up and put her foot on it and tightened the straps around her shoe. Then she put on the other one and stood up. \"Hey this isn't so bad,\" she said. She started to walk around in them and then she started to bounce in them. \"Hey this is pretty easy.\" \"You're good Ruthie,\" said Jennifer. \"Have you used them before?\" \"No this is my first time,\" Ruthie said. \"But you're acting like you have used them a lot because you're so good at using them.\" Ruthie kept walking around in them and started jumping on them till she fell down. \"I want to try them,\" said Joon. Ruthie sat down and took off the moon shoes. Joon put them on and started to walk around in them. She held her hands out as she walked. \"This is cool,\" she said. \"It feels like I am wearing mini trampolines on my feet.\" Joon started to jump in them. She had so much fun in them she didn't want to take them off. Jason kept walking around in them holding his arms out and falling. He would keep getting back up and walk again and stumble again. \"Now I want my own, can I have these Jen?\" Joon asked. \"No,\" said Jennifer. \"Please?\" \"No,\" Jennifer barked. \"She's kidding,\" Ruthie told her. \"How do you know?\" Jennifer asked. Ruthie shrugged. \"I'm not sure, I just do.\" \"Oh you're just guessing then.\" Joon and Jason walked around in the moon shoes. Joon held onto Jason's hand. They both walked in them. Joon would fall down with him when he would fall down. Jason would bounce in them and then fall down. Joon did it without falling. \"The therapist recommended I try having him go up and down the stairs with them,\" Jennifer said \"But I told her no way.\" \"She wanted Jason to go up and down the stairs with those on?\" Ruthie asked surprised. \"Does she even have a PHD?\" \"Yeah,\" said Jennifer. \"But I can't believe a doctor would tell a parent to have her child go up and down the stairs wearing those. That sounds very dangerous. What if some actually followed through?\" \"I don't know, the kid can get hurt and break a bone,\" Jennifer said. \"I can't believe his doctor be that stupid,\" said Ruthie. \"I know, I was surprised at that. It sounds dangerous for anybody. I don't see how that help his balance and coordination.\" \"So did you find a new therapist then?\" \"No.\" \"You should.\" \"I don't listen to everything she says,\" said Jennifer. \"Parents just need to use their common sense such as knowing it be dangerous to go up and down the stairs with moon shoes.\" \"But do you want to waste your money on a doctor who doesn't even act professional?\" Ruthie asked. \"I hate doctor hunting,\" said Jennifer. \"I would complain to whoever,\" Ruthie said. \"How would I do that?\" \"I don't know, complain to wherever she got her license from and tell them she told you to have your son walk up and down the stairs wearing moon shoes and how dangerous that is and you refused. She might be telling other parents to do that stuff too and they could actually follow through and their kid can get hurt. \"And why would any parent be that stupid to actually do that?\" Jennifer asked. \"Because they might trust the doctor and think she knows what she is doing and because she said to have their kid do it, they might assume it must be safe and okay to do just because the doctor told them so.\" \"Not my fault they be that stupid to not even think it be dangerous.\" \"Jennifer, do you remember the time when Mike told you to put your son in the pot and it was perfectly safe and legal because it only be for a week and you believed him?\" Ruthie said. \"Yeah, so?\" said Jennifer. \"But did that make you stupid for not knowing because you trusted him?\" \"It was only for a week,\" Jennifer pointed out. \"Don't all parents need breaks from their kids?\" \"Yes but putting them in the pot is not okay.\" \"Why?\" \"It just isn't okay, you're just going to have to trust me on this.\" \"But why can't you just tell me why?\" Ruthie sighed. She was used to getting all the \"whys\" from Jason but not from another grown up. She even remembered Jennifer doing that when they both lived in LA and it frustrated lot of people because she wanted to know why to everything and then accuse them of not really knowing why and they are just too lazy to even tell her. Ruthie just thought she was tenacious in getting the correct answers. When she would tell her people are getting frustrated with her questions, Jennifer would shrug and say \"They'll get over it, they need to learn.\" Ruthie thought that was so right, people do need to learn. Why were they afraid of \"why\" and afraid of explaining everything to people and expect everyone to follow their orders like they are their slaves and not even tell them why do this, why do that, why can't they do that, why can't they do this. Then Ruthie had forgotten about that from Jennifer when she hadn't seen her for years until she moved to Spokane. Then she was getting it from Jason and then from his mother and Ruthie remembered \"Oh I remember that in LA. I can't believe I forgot she did this.\" She could see where Jason got his \"why's\" from. Don't ever stop asking why. People need to learn and not be lazy to answer. But sometimes it got too much because you don't always know the answer or the explination why so it be irritating to have someone keep asking you why and not obey. So why not just tell them you don't know either yourself so the person would know you're not being lazy. \"Jen, you're just going to have to trust me okay? I don't know how to explain it. You just don't bet on humans,\" Ruthie said. \"Even if it's for for three days.\" Jennifer got mad at Mike about something one time so for revenge she put her son in the pot by telling him she takes him off her hands for three days and Mike lost and he had to take Jason but he drove him crazy. Touching all his things, being rough with his dog, jumping on his bed and asking \"why\" about everything, meltdowns and acting up so Mike called Jennifer and begged her to come and get him to take him home. So she got in her car and picked him up. She figured Mike wouldn't last that long with him because it be a new place for him and everything be different, he would act up and drive Mike crazy because none of his things were there. Jason was happy to be back home at his own apartment where his bed was at and all his other stuff and he could do his routines. After listening to Mike whine about her son when he was there, she just said \"Too bad I'm stupid I don't understand half a word you're saying.\" Then Mike felt upset when he heard her saying to Jason, \"Good boy for making him mad. I'm very proud of you.\" Mike thought she was crazy for using her kid to drive him crazy and how does she even live with that annoying little runt? Supposidly she told him how to act at his apartment to get him all upset he can't keep his bet. Luckily Ruthie wasn't at the poker game when it happened but she heard about it from Benny and his friends at the next poker game. She asked them why did they let it happen and Thomas said, \"We knew he wouldn't be able to last long for three days with him so it was funny.\" Jennifer told Ruthie happily how she was psychic for knowing Mike wouldn't last that long with her boy. \"No you just know your son well you knew he would drive Mike crazy with his antics,\" Ruthie told her. \"Remember the time you knew he wrecked Mike's car even though he was denying he went in the car?\" \"Yeah but that's because he likes to touch things and mess with things and he loves cars so I always had to keep my doors locked and my keys hidden so he can't get in my car,\" she said. - \"Hey why does Jason have on long pants and a long sleeve shirt, isn't he hot in that?\" Ruthie asked. \"He hates the straps on his bare skin,\" said Jennifer. \"It does feel uncomfortable but I deal with it.\" She finally took off her gear and scratched her arms where the straps touched. \"So what's the doctor's name?\" Ruthie asked. \"Terri heartrathger, why did you want to know?\" \"To file a complaint about her. I can't have her go telling other parents to have their kids do dangerous things. I'm surprised she even has her license.\" \"Maybe other parents are smart after all what is dangerous for their kids,\" said Jennifer. Then Peter came by. \"Hey,\" he said. \"You two decided to drop by eh?\" \"Yeah,\" said Ruthie. \"Are you aware that Jason's therapist told Jennifer to have her son go up and down the stairs wearing those,\" she pointed at the moon shoes. \"You've got to be kidding me?\" Peter said. \"She did,\" said Jennifer. \"Okay, I'm finding him a new therapist then. I won't waste my money on a quack. When did she tell you this?\" \"Like two weeks ago when she recommended the shoes.\" \"I am going to complain to the place about her. That is so dangerous.\" While Joon and Jason kept playing with the moon shoes, Jennifer and Peter brought Ruthie in his house to give her a little tour. Ruthie looked around and then she saw Jason's bedroom. \"Oh this has pretty much became his new home,\" she said. She saw lot of his stuff was there and his movies. Then they left his bedroom. Ruthie was about to enter the music room when Peter told her he didn't want anyone in there, nor in his art studio. She saw Peter's room. The bedroom was pretty big and he had a huge closet and bathroom with a jaccuzi in there. Then they heard some meowing. Ruthie looked down and saw a Calico cat had just walked in. \"Oh look how much she has grown,\" she said as she picked her up. Ruthie could remember Jennifer getting a Calico cat who was ten weeks old back in February. Peter brought it to the poker game to show her off to everyone and she scratched Mike when he held her. Of course it was an accident. Then she started to teeth too because she liked putting her teeth on people because it was her way of playing, Jennifer liked it so she let her do it to her. She named it Michelle right when she got her. Peter said she could have her at his house since the manager at her apartment didn't allow pets. Then Koplov, Peter's dog came in the room and Michelle started to hiss. He had Koplov back in Sweden at his parents house and then he had them ship him out to him last November. Peter picked his dog up and Ruthie left the bedroom with Michelle in her arms. They looked around his house some more. Ruthie had been inside before but it had been months since she had last been there. Koplov came downstairs and went outside through the doggy door. Peter had it put in after his dog arrived. Jason was happy he finally had pets. He never had one before because his father was allergic to them. After they were done touring the house, they came back outside. Joon wasn't wearing the shoes anymore and Jason still had his on. She was holding onto his hand as he kept walking. \"Hey Joon ready to go?\" Ruthie asked. Joon let go of Jason and told her she was going to head back to her apartment. Jason took off his moon shoes and his gear and left them in the lawn. \"Put your stuff away,\" Jennifer told him. She remembered to pick up her own moon shoes and gear just to set an example. Peter waved bye to Ruthie and Joon. \"Well he's sure happy,\" Ruthie said \"Which one?\" Joon asked. \"Jason.\" They didn't say anything else until they were on the road. \"Walking on those shoes and jumping in them was easy,\" said Joon. \"And Jen said it was hard.\" \"Well I don't think her coordination is that great,\" said Ruthie. \"I remember her bumping into walls and stumbling into stuff when we lived in LA.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. She would bump into people or children or chairs, anything in front of her and she used to get mad at the bus drivers for moving before she even got to sit so I always had her hold onto me. One day she fell into an elderly once the bus started moving and boy did she curse at the driver. 'Jeses Christ, do you drivers ever wait for any of your passengers to sit before you start moving?'\" Joon laughed. \"She said that?\" \"Something like that and she was so upset she forgot to apologize to the passenger so I had to do it for her and as we got off the bus I told the driver I really wish they wait on people till they are seated and the driver said they are on a very tight schedule and I said 'you accommodate elderlies and pregnant woman and handicapped people and are able to help people with directions but you don't have time to wait on young woman to be seated before you guys start moving?'\" \"That's rediculous,\" said Joon. \"I remember whenever we get on the bus, Jason would run to the back of the bus when the driver start moving. One day he fell and I yelled 'You son of a gun, this is a child. If he had gotten hurt I would have sued your guy's pants off\" and then we were kicked off the bus for my outburst.\" \"Yeah I do wish the drivers would be required to start moving when the passengers are seated after they get on,\" said Ruthie. \"You never know they could lose their balance and fall and get hurt. I remember Jennifer would stand with her legs spread out when she be putting money in the machine so she wouldn't fall. Then when she was pregnant, the drivers waited till she was seated before they started moving. After she had Jason, they still waited till she was seated.\" \"I bet pretty soon people will start suing the transportation when someone starts getting hurt and then they will have to wait till every person is seated before they start moving,\" Joon said. \"Or they just put up warning signs saying to watch your balance when the bus is in motion,\" Ruthie pointed out. \"I hate buses.\" \"I know you do.\" \"So why did you take buses? Didn't you drive?\" \"We didn't have a car then. We were young. I was trying to be a movie star while Jen was trying to hold down a job and then she was a movie critic.\" \"How did you two meet anyway?\" \"Oh I had friends and they lived in an apartment with room mates and Jen happened to be one of them. She didn't socialise with them or get along well with them. My friends would talk bad about her and I would feel awful for her and she have all these episodes. They never said anything good about her. They also did some mean things to her and I just decided to invite her to move in with me to get her away from them so we both got an apartment together and had quiet room mates, ones who didn't party and weren't loud and disruptive. People don't need to have lot of friends over and be obnoxious and have to have parties and we all respected each others personal space. They didn't go in our room and we didn't go in their room and she functioned a lot more normally. It was just those other people that were the problem and she needed quieter room mates and ones who respect her.\" \"How old were you then?\" \"Oh we were young, teens. I had just gotten out of high school then. But then we only knew each other for a few years before she got a boyfriend. Then we started to drift apart. We saw less of each other. Then she got married and I never saw her again.\" \"Did you know Jason as a baby?\" \"I saw him a few times but no more than a few months old.\" \"What was he like as a baby?\" \"He seemed normal. Cried like all babies do.\" \"So why didn't you two see lot of each other?\" \"I got busy so I never called her much and we lived all the way across the city. I was never good at keeping in touch with my old friends and she wasn't either so that's what split us up but we still talked on the phone once in a while. Then I moved up here.\" \"Why didn't you go see her?\" \"I don't know. I just didn't. Those other LA friends I had, I haven't spoken to them either in years or seen them since I have moved around LA.\" \"Wow.\" \"I think Jen and I hold a record of failing to keep friends,\" Ruthie joked. \"Now we are seeing less of each other again. Now busy with her happy life.\" \"I think Benny holds one for how many women he has turned away,\" Joon said. They drove the rest of the way home. Joon did good on the road. When she got to Spokane, she remembered to use the signals and remembered to look behind her before she switched lanes. Ah moon shoes. I first tried them when I was 10 and I was a walking disaster in them. I bumped into walls and furniture at someone's house and the daughter there though I was doing it on purpose when I went into her room and crashed into things knocking things on the floor. I got some when I was 19 finally and I was a lot better in them. My balance was better is why because my mother had me to occupational therapy to help my balance and coordination. Going up and down the stairs with moon shoes was based on a real experience. My boyfriend did therapy for his poor balance and coordination as well and he did it in school. The therapists would have him go up and down the stairs on roller skates and that shocked me. That sounds very dangerous and I don't see how that is supposed to help. Why did his parents even allow it? Did they even know about it? One day he fell down three flights of stairs and broke some bones. He had to go to the hospital. His parents could have sued the school but they didn't. The therapists never had anyone go up and down the stairs again on roller skates. In this story, Jen was smart to not have Jason do it with moon shoes despite being told to have him do it.[Chapter 17] Benny was working on a car when a gal walked in. She was a little chubby, had curly golden brown hair and wore glasses. A tow truck had pulled in pulling a 1981 Honda Accord behind. \"Oh hi,\" Benny said when he noticed her. \"I heard this place is the best in town so I had my car towed here. It broke down on the interstate.\" \"Okay what model and year is it?\" \"1981 Honda Accord,\" the gal said. \"It's right out there.\" Benny followed her outside and saw the car. \"Okay I'll take a look at it then. Come inside.\" The gal followed him to the office and Benny took out a form. \"I need your name and number and address.\" The gal gave her her name. Her name was Jeanne and she lived in Spokane Valley, an unincorporated city outside of Spokane. The STA went out there. Her transmission had stopped working while she was on the freeway so she had to pull over and was stuck there until an officer pulled over to see what was wrong. She told him she was having car troubles so the officer called for a tow truck. The guy who did the towing told her about Benny's Car Clinic and told her the owner gives out great deals to customers so she decided to tow it there. \"Do you have a ride?\" Benny asked. He didn't want her to be stranded. \"Oh I'll just call a cab or something,\" Jeanne replied. \"Thanks anyway.\" And she left. Benny was normally attracted to thin pretty women but Jeanne was on the chubby side but she was also pretty. The pretty women he knew were all thin, Jennifer, Ruthie, a female customer who once tried to take him out to dinner when he charged $750 for her engine. He had never hit on Jennifer before because he was dating Ruthie then and by the time they broken up, Jennifer was already dating Peter. He could probably handle her or would he have a complicated life again? It's not like she directed traffic or lit things on fire, she wasn't crazy and she didn't need supervision. He would most likely have a complicated relationship then except he wouldn't have to hire housekeepers to watch her or deal with things being lighten on fire or come home and see his banister had been painted or the kitchen cupboards or the walls and he wouldn't have to make sure she brushed her teeth or hair or bathed and make sure she is in bed. But she had a son who was complicated so would he be able to handle him and his needs? He handled Joon so he could probably handle him too but probably be driven crazy by him questioning everything and wanting to know why to everything. Tell him to not leave the yard and don't tell him why, he would do it anyway because there was no explanation why he was told not to. But then Jennifer would be there to help unless she gets overloaded with her job and wants to be left alone and not want to be bothered by her son or him. He had to try hard to not look at her as a label like he did with Joon. He used to see Sam as weird because of his antics he did and then he was able to look through it and thought he wasn't weird after all and different. He just had a gift. Now Benny had learned to not see Joon as sick as much like he used to. He remembered Ruthie saying one time \"They're all just labels. They don't define us.\" But Jennifer was a few years older than him but so was Ruthie but she was younger than Jennifer by a year. He didn't mind women who were a few years older than him. Just as long as they looked his age, he was attracted to them. Benny went back in his garage and got back to work. Eric teased him about Jeanne. \"Did you ask her out?\" Eric asked. \"No,\" said Benny. \"Ah why not? Your life isn't complicated anymore.\" \"I asked her if she had a ride and she said she'll call a cab,\" said Benny. \"Ah. You could have left work and given her a ride, I would have held down the fort.\" \"She's fat anyway,\" said Benny. \"Take her out for a walk or for a run, that will do,\" said Eric. \"Good thing you aren't Jen, she probably would have said it to her face.\" \"Nah I remember her scolding Jason for commenting you have a big tummy,\" Benny said. \"But it was hilarious when he said Mike was big too. Kids say the darnest things.\" \"Bluntness sure does come in handy sometimes,\" said Eric. \"Yeah and when Jen was scolding Jason, she told him if he wants to make comments about people being fat, say them to Mike about him being fat and she said it to make sure Mike heard her loud and clear.\" \"Hey do you think it's right what she is doing to her boy?\" Eric asked. \"What do you mean?\" Benny asked. \"Well she is using her boy to pick on Mike so she is basically teaching him to bully and it's okay to do. I mean man you shouldn't use your kids to pick on someone and then you tell them not to do it. It be too confusing for them.\" \"Well it doesn't matter because Mike hardly comes to the games.\" \"And I guess we are at fault too because we all have been using her for entertainment just so we can watch her bash Mike ,\" Eric said. \"We're the ones who kept encouraging it just by letting it happen and laughing at the things she says to Mike. Hey remember the time when Jason was drumming on the buckets and Jennifer let Mike go inside to try and take the sticks away from him just so he can fight with him?\" \"Yeah I remember,\" said Benny. \"Mike could have hurt him, what do you think?\" \"Peter would have nailed him if he did. Remember the time he punched him in the stomach for calling Jen a word?\" \"Oh yeah. That sure showed us how much he respects her.\" \"What about the time when Peter brought over Jen's kitten she had just gotten. She had let Mike hold it and then she scratched him.\" \"I think that was just an accident,\" said Eric. \"It be hard to train a kitten to also pick on certain people.\" \"Or maybe it was just a coincidence,\" Benny added. \"She didn't scratch anyone but Mike.\" \"Hey what is your favorite Jen moment at the game? Mine was when she placed a bet to Mike that he picks up doggy poo with his bare hands.\" \"Mine was when she told him he has to walk around in the backyard wearing nothing but a diaper,\" Benny said. \"Man does she have a thing with diapers?\" Eric said. \"She has mentioned them several other times already.\" \"Jenny says a lot of weird things.\" They both went back to work without talking. - Joon had really loved those moon shoes. She wanted a pair of her own. She checked her transaction register to see if they had enough money in the bank. Okay Sam gets paid next week, she already got her social security check and they paid the rent. So she had plenty of money left over from her social security check but they also needed food and Sam went shopping every two or three days. They had the store right down the street. Sam would get off the bus on Monroe and stop at the store and walk the three blocks home. \"Sam, I want to get a pair of moon shoes,\" Joon said. \"Uhh moon shoes?\" Sam said. \"Yeah.\" \"But you have shoes Joon,\" Sam said. \"No I mean shoes that you can jump in. Jennifer and Jason have a pair and she let me try them and they were so much fun. You can bounce in them and hop in them, jump, it's like wearing trampolines on your feet.\" \"Wow, I didn't know there was such product,\" Sam said. \"And Jen says they cost forty bucks.\" Sam spat his drink out. \"Whoa, that's pricey.\" \"I think we can afford it, I'm going to try and finish this portrait so I can try and sell it.\" \"Okay and you're going to use that for the shoes?\" \"Yes.\" Sam hadn't been studying for the test lately because he didn't see the point in it. He decided he would do it again when Benny is nearly finished with the car and then he would go back and take the written test. Joon insisted he should keep studying or else he forget the answers and he would have to start over from scratch. Sam said he would do it all again when Benny is nearly done with the car. - The next day, Joon was driving Ruthie's car again. Joon asked if she can go to Toys R Us. \"What do you want to go there for?\" Ruthie asked. \"There is something I want to get.\" \"Oh those shoes Jason and Jen have?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Okay. Maybe I should get a pair too. Then we can both have fun with them together.\" \"Sure.\" Joon headed for Toys R Us. She had to take Monroe street that went downtown and then Joon had to go over to Division street to get there. She remembered to look behind her before she switched lanes, remembered to signal, and remembered to stay behind the cross walk at a red light. The light turned yellow right when she got to the crosswalk and Ruthie told her she can keep going when she put on the break. \"When the light turns when you get this close,\" Ruthie explained. \"You don't need to stop because you wouldn't have enough time to do it so you can keep going.\" \"But yellow means slow down,\" Joon pointed out. \"Yes it does but if you put on the breaks when you are that close to the crosswalk, you will end up in the intersection. Plus you don't want to slam on your breaks or else the cars behind you will crash into you. It be dominoes.\" When they got to Toys R Us, Joon parked the car and they both got out. Joon locked it and they both went inside. They started to look for those shoes. \"Can I help you find something?\" a store employee asked. \"We are here looking for a pair of moon shoes,\" said Ruthie. \"Yes, we have maybe ten left in stock. We just ordered more.\" Ruthie and Joon followed him to the bike section and he pointed to the shoes. Joon looked down and saw the box. It showed a kid on them and Joon picked it up and looked at it. Ruthie picked up the other box and studied it. \"This is it,\" said Ruthie. \"Is that everything?\" the employee asked. \"Yes thank you,\" said Ruthie. Joon saw the weight capacity on the box. It could hold her weight real easily. She picked up another box for Sam. They brought them to the front of the store and paid for them. Ruthie used her credit card and Joon wrote them a check. They both walked out of the store carrying the boxes and the receipt in their hands. Joon couldn't wait till she got home to try them.[Chapter 18] Hi I'm back with this story. I had a horrible writer's block so I was stuck but when I decided to change the scene, things picked back up. I am stuck on my other stories again, Ass Burgers, and Everyone Hates Barney. Uh oh have I made Benny autistic lol? Oh well everyone has some traits of it. I'd rather give all the characters traits and all my OCs. It's easier that way. Sam loved the shoes. He and Joon would go outside together and bounce in them, Ruthie would join in too and they all bounced in them. It wasn't necessary for them to wear protective gear. They had great balance. Eric invited all his friends to his house for the fourth of July. Ruthie told Jennifer about it but she said she would think about it. \"Mike might be there, I think Eric invited him, they are they thinking about doing poker there also before the fireworks,\" said Ruthie. \"He might leave when he sees I'm there,\" said Jennifer. \"We'll if you want to come, it's at Eric's house on July forth, I don't know when it starts but give me a call that day and I'll tell you.\" \"I'll let Jason know.\" \"Peter too?\" Jennifer didn't answer thinking it was a reminder to let him know also. \"Let Peter know too,\" Ruthie said again. \"Okay I will.\" Ruthie took Sam and Joon to the firework stand. The whole tent was set in the parking lot of the supermarket. They all walked around and found some fireworks they liked. Ruthie bought forty dollars worth of fireworks and Sam and Joon got cheaper ones that didn't cost more than ten dollars. They all paid for them and went back to their apartment. Joon put on her moon shoes again and walked around in her art studio with them on. Sam was worried she would fall and get paint all over the floor. \"Joon, I don't think that's a good idea to wear them when you're painting,\" said Sam. \"Why not?\" Joon asked. \"Because you can fall.\" \"I'm not Jennifer. Put these on her and she's a walking disaster. She would probably fall into my paintings or knock my painting off the easel,\" she Joon.. \"What about Jason?\" \"Him too.\" \"I think they just need more practice,\" said Sam. \"Ruthie said she was never good with her balance. I read that people with autism have poor coordination skills and gross motor skills,\" said Joon. \"It's a shame about autistic people,\" said Sam. \"At least they don't have to hear voices in their head.\" \"Yeah.\" Benny was at work working on Jeanne's car. \"You should invite the gal to my place for the forth of July,\" said Eric. \"No I'm sure she has other plans,\" said Benny. \"Just call her anyway and see.\" \"I'm can't. I'm busy with Sam and Joon's car and I don't have time for a fat lady,\" said Benny. \"Don't find excuses,\" Eric said. \"Just call her, you have her number. You can give her a good work out.\" \"What if she doesn't want to change the way she looks?\" \"You won't know unless you know her,\" Eric told him. \"Let's go in your office.\" Benny stopped what he was doing and Eric grabbed his sleeve and pulled him into his office. Eric grabbed the phone off the hook and handed it to Benny. \"You know the number?\" Benny opened the filing cabinet and looked under E's and found her name. He took out the sheet and looked her number up and grabbed the phone from Eric. It was beeping so he had to hang it up and then dial. He heard it ringing and then \"Hello?\" Benny felt nervous inside. He couldn't get a word out. \"Hello?\" Jeanne asked. Benny was speechless. \"Just say 'hi',\" Eric whispered. Benny barely got the word out when he heard a click. \"She hung up so I guess it's a no,\" he said. \"Were you this nervous around Ruthie?\" Eric asked. \"No actually,\" Benny said. \"Then why are you nervous with this gal?\" \"Maybe because Ruthie wasn't fat,\" Benny said. Eric rolled his eyes. \"Stop using that as an excuse.\" \"Well she is, I would be lying if I said she wasn't,\" Benny pointed out. \"Just call her again and this time say \"hi,\" I'll help you out,\" said Eric. \"But she hung up on me.\" \"Because she thought no one was at the phone, just call her and told her you just called and you couldn't get a word out and just ask her to the forth of July.\" \"But I don't know how,\" Benny said. \"Okay when she answers, say \"Hi Jeanne this is Benny calling from Benny's Car Clinic.\"\" \"And?\" Benny asked. \"And I was wondering if you are interested in attending to go to my friend's house with me for the fourth of July.\" \"But wouldn't that make me sound like a freak?\" Benny asked. \"I am asking her over to a stranger's house and she might think I am a stalker or something.\" \"Just call her and don't you worry. Even if she thought you were, she would still have to come by to get her car when it's finished,\" said Eric. Benny went back to work. It was no use for Eric. He couldn't hook him up with another girl. He had tried to hook him up with other women back when Joon was still living with him but he used her as an excuse to not have a relationship. Now that he didn't have her anymore, he was using Jeanne's weight and finding other excuses to not ask her out. Benny was one complicated friend he had. - On the fourth of July, Ruthie, Sam and Joon were heading over to Eric's house. \"I want to drive,\" said Joon. \"There will be too many people in the car,\" Ruthie said. \"The rule is you are to drive with one other person in the car and I am sure Sam would like to come but he be so sad if he couldn't go.\" \"Call Benny, Sam can ride with him or I can drive his car,\" Joon suggested. Ruthie picked up Sam and Joon's phone and dialed Benny's cell number. Benny was working on Sam and Joon's car at his shop when he heard his cell phone ringing. He stopped what he was doing wiped his hands off using a baby wipe and picked up his cell phone. He opened the flap and pulled up the antenna and said \"Hello?\" \"Benny?\" Ruthie said. \"Hi,\" Benny said back. \"Joon wants to drive over to Eric's but she can't if Sam comes along so I was wondering if you can drop by and take Joon or Sam?\" \"Sure, I'd love to,\" Benny said. \"How's the driving coming along?\" \"It's going great,\" Ruthie said. \"Is she doing better with her driving?\" \"I'd say so.\" \"So when will you be over?\" Ruthie asked. \"We were about to head over to Eric's house.\" \"Oh, I was in the middle of working on her car so if I quit now, it be longer for her car to get done. Tell her that.\" \"Joon, Benny is working on your car right now so if he quits now to come here, then you will have to wait longer for your car to be finished,\" Ruthie informed her. \"When will he be finished?\" Joon asked. \"When will you be finished?\" Ruthie asked Benny. \"Uh another three or four weeks if I work on it everyday,\" Benny replied. \"No I meant today,\" Ruthie corrected. \"Oh, uh I was going to wait till evening to head over there before it gets dark,\" said Benny. \"Benny is going to head over there before it gets dark,\" Ruthie informed Joon. \"What time?\" Sam asked. \"What time?\" Ruthie asked Benny. \"Before it gets dark,\" said Benny again. \"Before it gets dark Sam,\" Ruthie informed him. \"But it is before dark and that's all day so that doesn't tell us what time,\" said Sam. \"You're a Jason,\" Joon teased. Sam and Jason both took things literal. That was one of the things they had in common. \"Sam wants to know what time because before dark lasts all day you know,\" Ruthie told Benny. Benny laughed. \"I don't know what time but maybe around six or seven.\" \"Around six or seven,\" Ruthie told Sam. \"So does Joon want me to come now or is she going to let me work on her car?\" Benny asked. \"Joon, do you want Benny to come here so you can drive or do you want him to keep working on the car?\" Ruthie asked. \"He can work on the car, the sooner the better,\" Joon replied. \"She wants you to keep working on the car,\" said Ruthie. \"Okay, I'll keep working on it and I'll be at Eric's soon,\" said Benny. \"Okay, see you soon, bye,\" said Ruthie. \"Bye,\" and Benny hung up and went back to work. He had his shop closed that day for the holiday so it was just him there alone. ","Summary":" I got bored working on my other story so I started this one. I got this great idea as I was working"}]
